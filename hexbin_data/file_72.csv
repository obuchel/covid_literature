107,107,107,Estimating Individual and Household Reproduction Numbers in an Emerging Epidemic,13.534969,5.107479,2007-08-22,"Reproduction numbers, defined as averages of the number of people infected by a typical case, play a central role in tracking infectious disease outbreaks. The aim of this paper is to develop methods for estimating reproduction numbers which are simple enough that they could be applied with limited data or in real time during an outbreak. I present a new estimator for the individual reproduction number, which describes the state of the epidemic at a point in time rather than tracking individuals over time, and discuss some potential benefits. Then, to capture more of the detail that micro-simulations have shown is important in outbreak dynamics, I analyse a model of transmission within and between households, and develop a method to estimate the household reproduction number, defined as the number of households infected by each infected household. This method is validated by numerical simulations of the spread of influenza and measles using historical data, and estimates are obtained for would-be emerging epidemics of these viruses. I argue that the household reproduction number is useful in assessing the impact of measures that target the household for isolation, quarantine, vaccination or prophylactic treatment, and measures such as social distancing and school or workplace closures which limit between-household transmission, all of which play a key role in current thinking on future infectious disease mitigation.","Fraser, Christophe",PLoS One,72,1
210,210,210,Augmented Lung Inflammation Protects against Influenza A Pneumonia,13.468269,8.139297,2009-01-12,"BACKGROUND: Influenza pneumonia causes high mortality every year, and pandemic episodes kill millions of people. Influenza-related mortality has been variously ascribed to an ineffective host response that fails to limit viral replication, an excessive host inflammatory response that results in lung injury and impairment of gas exchange, or to bacterial superinfection. We sought to determine whether lung inflammation promoted or impaired host survival in influenza pneumonia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To distinguish among these possible causes of influenza-related death, we induced robust lung inflammation by exposing mice to an aerosolized bacterial lysate prior to challenge with live virus. The treatment induced expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 8- and 40-fold greater, respectively, than that caused by lethal influenza infection. Yet, this augmented inflammation was associated with striking resistance to host mortality (0% vs 90% survival, p = 0.0001) and reduced viral titers (p = 0.004). Bacterial superinfection of virus infected lungs was not observed. When mice were repeatedly exposed to the bacterial lysate, as would be clinically desirable during an influenza epidemic, there was no tachyphylaxis of the induced viral resistance. When the bacterial lysate was administered after the viral challenge, there was still some mortality benefit, and when ribavirin was added to the aerosolized bacterial lysate, host survival was synergistically improved (0% vs 93.3% survival, p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data indicate that innate immune resistance to influenza can be effectively stimulated, and suggest that ineffective rather than excessive inflammation is the major cause of mortality in influenza pneumonia.","Tuvim, Michael J.; Evans, Scott E.; Clement, Cecilia G.; Dickey, Burton F.; Gilbert, Brian E.",PLoS One,72,1
752,752,752,Effects of a Non-Conservative Sequence on the Properties of β-glucuronidase from Aspergillus terreus Li-20,13.420194,4.951787,2012-02-07,"We cloned the β-glucuronidase gene (AtGUS) from Aspergillus terreus Li-20 encoding 657 amino acids (aa), which can transform glycyrrhizin into glycyrrhetinic acid monoglucuronide (GAMG) and glycyrrhetinic acid (GA). Based on sequence alignment, the C-terminal non-conservative sequence showed low identity with those of other species; thus, the partial sequence AtGUS(-3t) (1–592 aa) was amplified to determine the effects of the non-conservative sequence on the enzymatic properties. AtGUS and AtGUS(-3t) were expressed in E. coli BL21, producing AtGUS-E and AtGUS(-3t)-E, respectively. At the similar optimum temperature (55°C) and pH (AtGUS-E, 6.6; AtGUS(-3t)-E, 7.0) conditions, the thermal stability of AtGUS(-3t)-E was enhanced at 65°C, and the metal ions Co(2+), Ca(2+) and Ni(2+) showed opposite effects on AtGUS-E and AtGUS(-3t)-E, respectively. Furthermore, Km of AtGUS(-3t)-E (1.95 mM) was just nearly one-seventh that of AtGUS-E (12.9 mM), whereas the catalytic efficiency of AtGUS(-3t)-E was 3.2 fold higher than that of AtGUS-E (7.16 vs. 2.24 mM s(−1)), revealing that the truncation of non-conservative sequence can significantly improve the catalytic efficiency of AtGUS. Conformational analysis illustrated significant difference in the secondary structure between AtGUS-E and AtGUS(-3t)-E by circular dichroism (CD). The results showed that the truncation of the non-conservative sequence could preferably alter and influence the stability and catalytic efficiency of enzyme.","Liu, Yanli; Huangfu, Jie; Qi, Feng; Kaleem, Imdad; E, Wenwen; Li, Chun",PLoS One,72,1
2086,2086,2086,Statistical Evaluation of HTS Assays for Enzymatic Hydrolysis of β-Keto Esters,13.275515,5.1113663,2016-01-05,"β-keto esters are used as precursors for the synthesis of β-amino acids, which are building blocks for some classes of pharmaceuticals. Here we describe the comparison of screening procedures for hydrolases to be used for the hydrolysis of β-keto esters, the first step in the preparation of β-amino acids. Two of the tested high throughput screening (HTS) assays depend on coupled enzymatic reactions which detect the alcohol released during ester hydrolysis by luminescence or absorption. The third assay detects the pH shift due to acid formation using an indicator dye. To choose the most efficient approach for screening, we assessed these assays with different statistical methods—namely, the classical Z’-factor, standardized mean difference (SSMD), the Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test, and t-statistics. This revealed that all three assays are suitable for HTS, the pH assay performing best. Based on our data we discuss the explanatory power of different statistical measures. Finally, we successfully employed the pH assay to identify a very fast hydrolase in an enzyme-substrate screening.","Buß, O.; Jager, S.; Dold, S. -M.; Zimmermann, S.; Hamacher, K.; Schmitz, K.; Rudat, J.",PLoS One,72,1
2359,2359,2359,Gain-of-Function Research: Ethical Analysis,13.192251,4.795776,2016-08-08,"Gain-of-function (GOF) research involves experimentation that aims or is expected to (and/or, perhaps, actually does) increase the transmissibility and/or virulence of pathogens. Such research, when conducted by responsible scientists, usually aims to improve understanding of disease causing agents, their interaction with human hosts, and/or their potential to cause pandemics. The ultimate objective of such research is to better inform public health and preparedness efforts and/or development of medical countermeasures. Despite these important potential benefits, GOF research (GOFR) can pose risks regarding biosecurity and biosafety. In 2014 the administration of US President Barack Obama called for a “pause” on funding (and relevant research with existing US Government funding) of GOF experiments involving influenza, SARS, and MERS viruses in particular. With announcement of this pause, the US Government launched a “deliberative process” regarding risks and benefits of GOFR to inform future funding decisions—and the US National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) was tasked with making recommendations to the US Government on this matter. As part of this deliberative process the National Institutes of Health commissioned this Ethical Analysis White Paper, requesting that it provide (1) review and summary of ethical literature on GOFR, (2) identification and analysis of existing ethical and decision-making frameworks relevant to (i) the evaluation of risks and benefits of GOFR, (ii) decision-making about the conduct of GOF studies, and (iii) the development of US policy regarding GOFR (especially with respect to funding of GOFR), and (3) development of an ethical and decision-making framework that may be considered by NSABB when analyzing information provided by GOFR risk-benefit assessment, and when crafting its final recommendations (especially regarding policy decisions about funding of GOFR in particular). The ethical and decision-making framework ultimately developed is based on the idea that there are numerous ethically relevant dimensions upon which any given case of GOFR can fare better or worse (as opposed to there being necessary conditions that are either satisfied or not satisfied, where all must be satisfied in order for a given case of GOFR to be considered ethically acceptable): research imperative, proportionality, minimization of risks, manageability of risks, justice, good governance (i.e., democracy), evidence, and international outlook and engagement. Rather than drawing a sharp bright line between GOFR studies that are ethically acceptable and those that are ethically unacceptable, this framework is designed to indicate where any given study would fall on an ethical spectrum—where imaginable cases of GOFR might range from those that are most ethically acceptable (perhaps even ethically praiseworthy or ethically obligatory), at one end of the spectrum, to those that are most ethically problematic or unacceptable (and thus should not be funded, or conducted), at the other. The aim should be that any GOFR pursued (and/or funded) should be as far as possible towards the former end of the spectrum.","Selgelid, Michael J.",Sci Eng Ethics,72,1

While such structures have been actively studied and replicated in the laboratory, it remains unclear whether they can be used for biomedical applications. Here we show a transparent photonic nanostructure inspired by the longtail glasswing (Chorinea faunus) butterfly and demonstrate its use in intraocular pressure (IOP) sensors in vivo. We exploit the phase separation between two immiscible polymers (poly(methyl methacrylate) and polystyrene) to form nanostructured features on top of a Si(3)N(4) substrate. The membrane thus formed shows good angle-independent white light transmission, strong hydrophilicity and anti-biofouling properties that prevent adhesion of proteins, bacteria, and eukaryotic cells. We then developed a microscale implantable IOP sensor using our photonic membrane as an optomechanical sensing element. Finally, we performed in vivo testing on New Zealand white rabbits and show that our device reduces the mean IOP measurement variation compared to conventional rebound tonometry without signs of inflammation.","Narasimhan, Vinayak; Siddique, Radwanul Hasan; Lee, Jeong Oen; Kumar, Shailabh; Ndjamen, Blaise; Du, Juan; Hong, Natalie; Sretavan, David; Choo, Hyuck",Nat Nanotechnol,72,17
3555,3555,3555,"GI-16 lineage (624/I or Q1), there and back again: The history of one of the major threats for poultry farming of our era",13.64797,4.937274,2018-12-20,"The genetic variability of Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is one of the main challenges for its control, hindering not only the development of effective vaccination strategies but also its classification and, consequently, epidemiology understanding. The 624/I and Q1 genotypes, now recognized to be part of the GI-16 lineage, represent an excellent example of the practical consequences of IBV molecular epidemiology limited knowledge. In fact, being their common origin unrecognized for a long time, independent epidemiological pictures were drawn for the two genotypes. To fix this misinterpretation, the present study reconstructs the history, population dynamics and spreading patterns of GI-16 lineage as a whole using a phylodynamic approach. A collection of worldwide available hypervariable region 1 and 2 (HVR12) and 3 (HVR3) sequences of the S1 protein was analysed together with 258 HVR3 sequences obtained from samples collected in Italy (the country where this genotype was initially identified) since 1963. The results demonstrate that after its emergence at the beginning of the XX century, GI-16 was able to persist until present days in Italy. Approximately in the late 1980s, it migrated to Asia, which became the main nucleus for further spreading to Middle East, Europe and especially South America, likely through multiple introduction events. A remarkable among-country diffusion was also demonstrated in Asia and South America. Interestingly, although most of the recent Italian GI-16 strains originated from ancestral viruses detected in the same country, a couple were closely related to Chinese ones, supporting a backward viral flow from China to Italy. Besides to the specific case-study results, this work highlights the misconceptions that originate from the lack of a unified nomenclature and poor molecular epidemiology data generation and sharing. This shortcoming appears particularly relevant since the described scenario could likely be shared by many other IBV genotypes and pathogens in general.","Franzo, Giovanni; Cecchinato, Mattia; Tosi, Giovanni; Fiorentini, Laura; Faccin, Francesca; Tucciarone, Claudia Maria; Trogu, Tiziana; Barbieri, Ilaria; Massi, Paola; Moreno, Ana",PLoS One,72,1

Although IRs are not unique to nanomedicines, they represent a hurdle for the translation of nanotechnology-based drug products. This Perspective offers a big picture of the pharmaceutical field and examines current understanding of mechanisms responsible for IRs to nanomedicines. We outline outstanding questions, review currently available experimental evidence to provide some answers and highlight the gaps.

Given the vast time that Earth has been teeming with life, do astrobiologists truly understand what geological features untouched by biological processes would look like? In the search for extraterrestrial life in the Universe, it is critical to determine what constitutes a biosignature across multiple scales, and how this compares with “abiosignatures” formed by nonliving processes. Developing standards for abiotic and biotic characteristics would provide quantitative metrics for comparison across different data types and observational time frames. The evidence for life detection falls into three categories of biosignatures: (1) substances, such as elemental abundances, isotopes, molecules, allotropes, enantiomers, minerals, and their associated properties; (2) objects that are physical features such as mats, fossils including trace-fossils and microbialites (stromatolites), and concretions; and (3) patterns, such as physical three-dimensional or conceptual n-dimensional relationships of physical or chemical phenomena, including patterns of intermolecular abundances of organic homologues, and patterns of stable isotopic abundances between and within compounds. Five key challenges that warrant future exploration by the astrobiology community include the following: (1) examining phenomena at the “right” spatial scales because biosignatures may elude us if not examined with the appropriate instrumentation or modeling approach at that specific scale; (2) identifying the precise context across multiple spatial and temporal scales to understand how tangible biosignatures may or may not be preserved; (3) increasing capability to mine big data sets to reveal relationships, for example, how Earth's mineral diversity may have evolved in conjunction with life; (4) leveraging cyberinfrastructure for data management of biosignature types, characteristics, and classifications; and (5) using three-dimensional to n-D representations of biotic and abiotic models overlain on multiple overlapping spatial and temporal relationships to provide new insights.","Chan, Marjorie A.; Hinman, Nancy W.; Potter-McIntyre, Sally L.; Schubert, Keith E.; Gillams, Richard J.; Awramik, Stanley M.; Boston, Penelope J.; Bower, Dina M.; Des Marais, David J.; Farmer, Jack D.; Jia, Tony Z.; King, Penelope L.; Hazen, Robert M.; Léveillé, Richard J.; Papineau, Dominic; Rempfert, Kaitlin R.; Sánchez-Román, Mónica; Spear, John R.; Southam, Gordon; Stern, Jennifer C.; Cleaves, Henderson James",Astrobiology,72,1

This study reveals that cellular stress leads to the incorporation of the adaptor protein SINTBAD (TBKBP1) into membraneless, cytosolic speckles. Determination of the interactome identified >100 proteins forming constitutive and stress-inducible members of an MLO that we termed SINT-speckles. SINT-speckles partially colocalize with activated TBK1, and deletion of SINTBAD and the SINT-speckle component AZI2 leads to impaired TBK1 phosphorylation. Dynamic formation of SINT-speckles is positively controlled by the acetyltransferase KAT2A (GCN5) and antagonized by heat shock protein-mediated chaperone activity. SINT-speckle formation is also inhibited by the autophagy-initiating kinases ULK1/2, and knockdown of these kinases prevented focal TBK1 phosphorylation in a pathway-specific manner. The phlebovirus-encoded non-structural protein S enhances ULK1-mediated TBK1 phosphorylation and shows a stress-induced translocation to SINT-speckles, raising the possibility that viruses can also target this signaling hub to manipulate host cell functions.","Saul, Vera Vivian; Seibert, Markus; Krüger, Marcus; Jeratsch, Sylvia; Kracht, Michael; Schmitz, Michael Lienhard",iScience,72,1

Traditional population-based methods may fail to capture important events, particularly in settings with limited access to health care, such as urban informal settlements. In such environments, a mixture of surface water runoff and human feces containing pathogenic microorganisms could be used as a surveillance surrogate. METHOD: We conducted a temporal metagenomic analysis of urban sewage from Kibera, an urban informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya, to detect and quantify bacterial and associated antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants, viral and parasitic pathogens. Data were examined in conjunction with data from ongoing clinical infectious disease surveillance. RESULTS: A large variation of read abundances related to bacteria, viruses, and parasites of medical importance, as well as bacterial associated antimicrobial resistance genes over time were detected. Significant increased abundances were observed for a number of bacterial pathogens coinciding with higher abundances of AMR genes. Vibrio cholerae as well as rotavirus A, among other virus peaked in several weeks during the study period whereas Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp, varied more over time. CONCLUSION: The metagenomic surveillance approach for monitoring circulating pathogens in sewage was able to detect putative pathogen and resistance loads in an urban informal settlement. Thus, valuable if generated in real time to serve as a comprehensive infectious disease agent surveillance system with the potential to guide disease prevention and treatment.

This BAC clone, characterized as part of a contig constructed near a virus resistance gene, exhibited restriction fragment length polymorphism with an overlapping clone of the contig. Restriction analysis of DNA obtained from individual colonies of the stock culture indicated the presence of a mixed population of wild-type and insertional mutants. Sequence analysis of both members of the population revealed the presence of IS10R, an insertion-sequence from Escherichia coli. A BLAST search for IS10-like sequences detected unexpected homologies with a large number of eukaryotic sequences from Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. Southern analysis of a random sample of BAC clones failed to detect IS10 in the BAC DNA. However, prolonged sub-culturing of a set of 15 clones resulted in transposition into the BAC DNA. Eventually, all cultures acquired a 2.3-kb fragment that hybridized strongly with IS10. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of a preferred site for transposition in the BAC vector. These results indicate that a large number, if not all, of the BAC libraries from different organisms are contaminated with IS10R. The source of this element has been identified as the DH10B strain of E. coli used as the host for BAC libraries.","Astua-Monge, G.; Lyznik, A.; Jones, V.; Mackenzie, S. A.; Vallejos, C.

We first review the β(t) recovery procedures and give the resulting formulas, using both methods, for the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) and susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) models. We present a modification of one procedure, which is then shown to be identical to the other. Second, we explore several technical issues that appear when implementing the procedure for the SIR model; these are important when generating the time-dependent transmission function for real-world disease data. Third, we extend the recovery method to heterogeneous populations modeled with a certain SIR-type model with multiple time-dependent transmission functions. Finally, we apply the β(t) recovery procedure to data from the 2002–2003 influenza season and for the six seasons from 2002–2003 through 2007–2008, for both one population class and for two age classes. We discuss the consequences of the technical conditions of the procedure applied to the influenza data.

The advisory process is, in the ideal situation, a collective duty of science and politics. The final decision rests ultimately with politicians. An understanding of the differences between science and politics is necessary for successfully providing advice to politicians. The requirements necessary to allow politics to substantially follow the advice of scientists are multifarious. The first of these is trust from the side of politics and the public and from the side of science competitive research, respect and communication skills, neutrality and integrity. From these requireberatung ments it is possible to derive criteria for quality assurance in advice to politics. The maintenance of scientific expertise at the competitive international level demands independent, qualified and adequately financed research. Governmental institutes have an antenna function: they have to recognize in good time whether risks are increasing, whether the government has to be informed and whether there is a need for action. The continuing maintenance of excellence requires measures of quality assurance at all levels. Evidence for the quality of advice to politics can, for example, be found in the good reputation of an institution and its prominent representatives. Success in research is an indirect quality criterion that can be and should be measured to a certain extent.

Using Theiler's virus infection of SJL mice as a model of this type of disease, we have investigated the roles of two chemokines—regulated on activation, normal T cell-expressed and secreted (RANTES) chemokine and monokine induced by IFN-γ (MIG)—by treating mice with antisera that block lymphocyte migration. Control, infected mice showed virus persistence, mild inflammation and a small degree of demyelination in the white matter of the spinal cord at 6 weeks post-infection. Treatment of mice with RANTES antiserum starting at 2 weeks post-infection increased both viral antigen expression and the severity of inflammatory demyelination at 6 weeks post-infection. MIG antiserum increased the spread of virus and the proportion of spinal cord white matter with demyelination. Overall, viral antigen levels correlated strongly with the extent of pathology. At the RNA level, high virus expression was associated with low IL-2 and high IL-10 levels, and RANTES antiserum decreased the IL-2/IL-10 ratio. Our results suggest that RANTES and MIG participate in an immune response that attempts to restrict viral expression while limiting immunopathology and that anti-chemokine treatment poses the risk of exacerbating both conditions in the long term.","Ure, Daren R.; Lane, Thomas E.; Liu, Michael T.; Rodriguez, Moses",Int Immunol,72,1

The crystal structure of the protease domain was determined to a resolution of 2.4 Å using multiple isomorphous replacement and anomalous scattering. The SeMV protease domain exhibited the characteristic trypsin fold and was found to be closer to cellular serine proteases than to other viral proteases. The residues of the S1-binding pocket, H298, T279 and N308 were mutated to alanine in the ΔN70-Protease–VPg polyprotein, and the cis-cleavage activity was examined. The H298A and T279A mutants were inactive, while the N308A mutant was partially active, suggesting that the interactions of H298 and T279 with P1-glutamate are crucial for the E–T/S cleavage. A region of exposed aromatic amino acids, probably essential for interaction with VPg, was identified on the protease domain, and this interaction could play a major role in modulating the function of the protease.","Gayathri, P.; Satheshkumar, P.S.; Prasad, K.; Nair, Smita; Savithri, H.S.; Murthy, M.R.N.",Virology,72,1

Six and twelve hours after inoculation, before diarrhea, extensive specific viral immunofluorescence and viral particles on electron microscopy were seen in villus but not crypt enterocytes in jejunum, mid-intestine, and ileum. At 24 and 40 hr, when diarrhea was most severe, immunofluorescence was patchy; villus blunting (P < 0.001) and increased crypt depth (P < 0.001) were observed by light microscopy in all segments; radioautographically labeled enterocytes showed accelerated migration and shortened life span; and cells on villi were deficient in sucrose activity (P < 0.001) and rich in thymidine kinase activity (P < 0.005), suggesting relative immaturity. Villus structure recovered by 72 and 144 hr, although deeper crypts (P < 0.001) and accelerated migration still persisted. We conclude that extensive, almost simultaneous direct viral invasion of villus enterocytes can occur along the entire length of the small intestine after a single exposure to virus, and thus can cause shedding of mature villus cells and proliferation and accelerated migration of cells from the crypts. At the height of diarrhea, when enterocyte turnover is maximal, the epithelium consists predominantly of immature virus-free cells which have migrated to the villi in a relatively undifferentiated state.","Shepherd, R.W.; Butler, D.G.; Cutz, E.; Gall, D.G.; Hamilton, J.R.",Gastroenterology,72,1

Data are also presented on aphid catches in suction traps at two heights and in light traps. Apart from colour sensitivity (yellow versus white) there was apparently a separate response to colour which in some species varied with season. Within yellow‐sensitive species there was also a differential response to colour. With the experimental methods used, it was not possible to define mathematically the active and passive landing components on cylindrical traps. Though the active landing component was large it varied between aphid species. Most species caught on horizontal traps at ground level had been flying above 1 m. In some species the response of males to colour and their landing behaviour differed from that of viviparae and oviparae. Four years data from suction traps suggest that aphid species can be divided into three categories on the basis of the height at which they normally fly. One group, mostly tree‐feeders, always show the greatest density at a high level (12.2 m) throughout the season. The second group always have the highest density at a low level (1 m) whilst a third group of species change at a specific date each autumn from a maximum density at 1–12.2 m. Attraction to light (moth trap) appeared to be linked with the grouping of species by height of flight. The interpretation of catch data is discussed in the light of these observations.","A'BROOK, JOHN",Ann Appl Biol,72,22

To address these unmet healthcare needs, especially for the early prediction and treatment of major diseases, health informatics, which deals with the acquisition, transmission, processing, storage, retrieval, and use of health information, has emerged as an active area of interdisciplinary research. In particular, acquisition of health-related information by unobtrusive sensing and wearable technologies is considered as a cornerstone in health informatics. Sensors can be weaved or integrated into clothing, accessories, and the living environment, such that health information can be acquired seamlessly and pervasively in daily living. Sensors can even be designed as stick-on electronic tattoos or directly printed onto human skin to enable long-term health monitoring. This paper aims to provide an overview of four emerging unobtrusive and wearable technologies, which are essential to the realization of pervasive health information acquisition, including: 1) unobtrusive sensing methods, 2) smart textile technology, 3) flexible-stretchable-printable electronics, and 4) sensor fusion, and then to identify some future directions of research.","Zheng, Ya-Li; Ding, Xiao-Rong; Poon, Carmen Chung Yan; Lo, Benny Ping Lai; Zhang, Heye; Zhou, Xiao-Lin; Yang, Guang-Zhong; Zhao, Ni; Zhang, Yuan-Ting *",IEEE Trans Biomed Eng,72,22

These include new viruses appearing alongside other known reemerging viruses (West Nile virus, Chikungunya) as well as new strains of bacteria and parasites (Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma cruzi) and finally pathologic prion protein (variant Creutzfeldt‐Jakob disease). Genomic mutations of known viruses (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus) can also be at the origin of variants susceptible to escaping detection by diagnostic tests. New technologies that would allow the simultaneous detection of several blood‐transmissible agents are now needed for the development and improvement of screening strategies. DNA microarrays have been developed for use in immunohematology laboratories for blood group genotyping. Their application in the detection of infectious agents, however, has been hindered by additional technological hurdles. For instance, the variability among and within genomes of interest complicate target amplification and multiplex analysis. Advances in biosensor technologies based on alternative detection strategies have offered new perspectives on pathogen detection; however, whether they are adaptable to diagnostic applications testing biologic fluids is under debate. Elsewhere, current nanotechnologies now offer new tools to improve the sample preparation, target capture, and detection steps. Second‐generation devices combining micro‐ and nanotechnologies have brought us one step closer to the potential development of innovative and multiplexed approaches applicable to the screening of blood for transmissible agents.","Fournier‐Wirth, Chantal; Jaffrezic‐Renault, Nicole; Coste, Joliette",Transfusion,72,1

We used the IUCN Red List of Threatened and Endangered Species and compiled data on hosts threatened by infectious disease and their parasites to better understand the role of infectious disease in contemporary host extinctions. The majority of mammal species considered threatened by parasites were either carnivores or artiodactyls, two clades that include the majority of domesticated animals. Parasites affecting host threat status were predominantly viruses and bacteria that infect a wide range of host species, including domesticated animals. Counter to our predictions, parasites transmitted by close contact were more likely to cause extinction risk than those transmitted by other routes. Mammal species threatened by parasites were not better studied for infectious diseases than other threatened mammals and did not have more parasites or differ in four key traits demonstrated to affect parasite species richness in other comparative studies. Our findings underscore the need for better information concerning the distribution and impacts of infectious diseases in populations of endangered mammals. In addition, our results suggest that evolutionary similarity to domesticated animals may be a key factor associated with parasite‐mediated declines; thus, efforts to limit contact between domesticated hosts and wildlife could reduce extinction risk.","PEDERSEN, AMY B.; JONES, KATE E.; NUNN, CHARLES L.; ALTIZER, SONIA",Conserv Biol,72,1

In the present study, we deal with a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) metapopulation model where the epidemic process in each patch is represented by an SIR model and the mobility of individuals is assumed to be a homogeneous diffusion. We consider two types of patches including high-risk and low-risk ones under the assumption that a local patch is changed from a high-risk one to a low-risk one by an intervention. We theoretically analyze the intervention threshold which indicates the critical fraction of low-risk patches for preventing a global epidemic outbreak. We show that an intervention targeted to high-degree patches is more effective for epidemic control than a random intervention. The theoretical results are validated by Monte Carlo simulations for synthetic and realistic scale-free patch networks. The theoretical results also reveal that the intervention threshold depends on the human mobility network and the mobility rate. Our approach is useful for exploring better local interventions aimed at containment of epidemics.","Matsuki, Akari; Tanaka, Gouhei",,72,1

Further analysis was performed by using univariate and multivariable logistic regression and Poisson regression. There was a significant increase of 733% in the number of NIV users from 2000 to 2012. NIV use was frequently observed in old-age persons (aOR 3.99, 95% CI 3.06–5.21 for those aged ≥ 80 years), women (aOR 1.33, 95% CI 1.18–1.50), patients admitted to a high-level hospital (aOR 1.95, 95% CI 1.63−2.34 for those admitted to a medical center), and patients with a higher Charlson comorbidity index (CCI, aOR 1.38−1.66 for those CCI ≥ 2).

No significant NO(2) differences between exposed and control animals were found for the nitrogen washout, compliance, lung volume, or diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide measurements. At 78 weeks, however, a reduction in δFEF(25%), an estimate of convexity in the later portion of the forced expiratory flow volume curve, was observed. Breathing patterns and mechanics were also assessed postexposure in a parallel group of similarly exposed unanesthetized rats. These rats were examined during a filtered air, 4 and 8% carbon dioxide (CO(2)) challenge. In the unanesthetized rat, frequency of breathing was significantly decreased and tidal volume, expiratory resistance, and inspiratory and expiratory times tended to increase. For several of these variables, the largest response also occurred at 78 weeks and seemed to be exacerbated by CO(2) challenge. For both unanesthetized and anesthetized test groups, the magnitude of the changes in pulmonary function were small and their significance was borderline, thus indicating that near-lifetime exposure to the rat of a high ambient urbanprofile of N(O2) does not lead to dysfunction suggestive of degenerative lung disease.","TEPPER, JEFFREY S.; COSTA, DANIEL L.; WINSETT, DARRELL W.; STEVENS, MICHAEL A.; DOERFLER, DONALD L.; WATKINSON, WILLIAM P.",Fundam Appl Toxicol,72,1

The mechanistic idea of healthcare being a ‘product’ generated by the healthcare system and delivered to patients is replaced by that of a service co-created by the healthcare system and the users of healthcare services. Fjeldstad et al offer an approach for conceptualising value creation in complex service contexts that we believe is applicable to coproduction of healthcare service. We have adapted Fjeldstad’s value creation model based on a detailed case study of a renal haemodialysis service in Jonkoping, Sweden, which demonstrates coproduction characteristics and key elements of Fjeldstad’s model. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We propose a five-part coproduction value creation model for healthcare service: (1) value chain, characterised by a standardised set of processes that serve a commonly occurring need; (2) value shop, which offers a customised response for unique cases; (3) a facilitated value network, which involves groups of individuals struggling with similar challenges; (4) interconnection between shop, chain and network elements and (5) leadership. We will seek to articulate and assess the value creation model through the work of a community of practice comprised of a diverse international workgroup with representation from executive, financial and clinical leaders as well as other key stakeholders from multiple health systems. We then will conduct pilot studies of a qualitative self-assessment process in participating health systems, and ultimately develop and test quantitative measures for assessing coproduction value creation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health Institutional Review Board (D-HH IRB) as a minimal risk research study. Findings and scholarship will be disseminated broadly through continuous engagement with health system stakeholders, national and international academic presentations and publications and an internet-based electronic platform for publicly accessible study information.","Oliver, Brant J; Batalden, Paul B; DiMilia, Peter Rocco; Forcino, Rachel C; Foster, Tina C; Nelson, Eugene C; Garre, Boel Anderson",BMJ Open,72,1

This finding seemingly supports the view that the automatically determined touch location in external space affects limb assignment: the crossed right hand is localized in left space, and this conflict presumably provokes hand assignment errors. Here, participants judged on which hand the first of two stimuli, presented during a bimanual movement, had occurred, and then indicated its external location by a reach-to-point movement. When participants incorrectly chose the hand stimulated second, they pointed to where that hand had been at the correct, first time point, though no stimulus had occurred at that location. This behavior suggests that stimulus localization depended on hand assignment, not vice versa. It is, thus, incompatible with the notion of automatic computation of external stimulus location upon occurrence. Instead, humans construct external touch location post-hoc and on demand.","Maij, Femke; Seegelke, Christian; Medendorp, W Pieter; Heed, Tobias",,72,1

While vaccines have proven to be the best preventive method to combat the flu, the attitude and knowledge about vaccines are a major hindrance to higher uptake in most of the countries. The yearly coverage, especially in the vulnerable groups in the population, often remains below the herd immunity level despite the Flu Awareness Campaign organized by WHO every year worldwide. This brings immense challenges to the nation’s public health protection agency for strategic decision-making in controlling the flu outbreak every year. To understand the impact of public perceptions and vaccination decisions while designing optimal immunization policy, we model the individual decision-making as a two-strategy pairwise contest game, where pay-off is considered as a function of public health effort for the campaign. We use Pontryagin’s maximum principle to identify the best possible strategy for public health to implement vaccination and reduce infection at a minimum cost. Our optimal analysis shows that the cost of public health initiatives is qualitatively and quantitatively different under different public perceptions and attitudes towards vaccinations. When individual risk perception evolves with vaccine uptake or disease induced death, our model demonstrates a feed-forward mechanism in the dynamics of vaccination and exhibits an increase in vaccine uptake. Using numerical simulation, we also observe that the optimal cost can be minimized by putting the effort in the beginning and later part of the outbreak rather than during the peak. It confers that public health efforts towards disseminating disease severity or actual vaccination risk might accelerate the vaccination coverage and mitigate the infection faster.","Deka, Aniruddha; Pantha, Buddhi; Bhattacharyya, Samit",Bull Math Biol,72,1

Antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (aPDI) was tested on a methicillin-sensitive reference strain (ATCC 25923) and a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain (GenBank accession number Mh087437) isolated from a clinical sample. The photoinactivation efficacy was investigated by exposing the bacterial strains to different E-141ii concentrations (0.0, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 µM) and to red light (625 nm) at 30 J cm(−2). The results showed that E-141ii itself did not prevent bacterial growth for all tested concentrations when cultures were placed in the dark. By contrast, E-141ii photoinactivated both methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) under red-light illumination. However, different dose responses were observed for MSSA and MRSA. Whilst the MSSA growth was inhibited to the detection limit of the method with E-141ii at 2.5 µM, >10 µM concentrations were required to inhibit the growth of MRSA. The data also suggest that E-141ii can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) via Type I reaction by electron transfer from its first excited singlet state to oxygen molecules. Our findings demonstrate that the tested food colorant has great potential to be used in aPDI of MRSA.","Caires, Cynthia S.

This system has been studied as a relevant infection model for multiple sclerosis (MS). Therefore, defining the type of T cell responses and their functions is critically important for understanding the relevant pathogenic mechanisms. In this study, we adoptively transferred naive VP2-specific TCR-Tg CD4(+) T cells into syngeneic susceptible SJL mice and monitored the development of the disease and the activation and proliferation of CD4(+) T cells during the early stages of viral infection. The preexisting VP2-specific naive CD4(+) T cells promoted the pathogenesis of the disease in a dose-dependent manner. The transferred VP2-specific CD4(+) T cells proliferated rapidly in the CNS starting at 2–3 dpi. High levels of FoxP3(+)CD4(+) T cells were found in the CNS early in viral infection (3 dpi) and persisted throughout the infection. Activated VP2-specific FoxP3(+)CD4(+) T cells inhibited the production of IFN-γ, but not IL-17, via the same VP2-specific CD4(+) T cells without interfering in proliferation. Thus, the early presence of regulatory T cells in the CNS with viral infection may favor the induction of pathogenic Th17 cells over protective Th1 cells in susceptible mice, thereby establishing the pathogenesis of virus-induced demyelinating disease.","Kang, Hyun Seok; Hou, Wanqiu; Kim, Byung S.",Int J Mol Sci,72,1

Taxifolin (also known as dihydroquercetin) is an example of a typical flavonoid. Some new forms of taxifolin have been reported previously, however it is still unclear whether they represent polymorphic modifications. In this paper, we tried to answer the question about the taxifolin polymorphism. Taxifolin microtubes and taxifolin microspheres were synthesized from raw taxifolin API using several methods of crystal engineering. All forms were described with the help of spectral methods, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), and thermal analysis (TA). SEM reveals that the morphology of the solid phase is very specific for each sample. Although XRPD patterns of raw taxifolin and microtubes look similar, their TA profiles differ significantly. At the same time, raw taxifolin and microspheres have nearly identical thermograms, while XRPD shows that the former is a crystalline and the latter is an amorphous substance. Only the use of complex analyses allowed us to put the puzzle together and to confirm the polymorphism of taxifolin. This article demonstrates that taxifolin microtubes are a pseudopolymorphic modification of raw taxifolin.","Terekhov, Roman P.; Selivanova, Irina A.; Tyukavkina, Nonna A.; Ilyasov, Igor R.; Zhevlakova, Anastasiya K.; Dzuban, Alexander V.; Bogdanov, Anatoliy G.; Davidovich, Georgiy N.; Shylov, Gennadii V.; Utenishev, Andrey N.; Kovalev, Dmitriy Yu.; Fenin, Anatoliy A.; Kabluchko, Tatyana G.",Molecules,72,1

PK catalyzed phosphorylation is critical to the regulation of cellular signaling pathways that affect crucial cell processes, such as growth, differentiation, and metabolism. PKs represent attractive targets for drugs against a wide spectrum of diseases, including viral infections. Two different approaches are being applied in the search for antivirals: compounds directed against viral targets (direct-acting antivirals, DAAs), or against cellular components essential for the viral life cycle (host-directed antivirals, HDAs). One of the main drawbacks of DAAs is the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viruses. In contrast, HDAs present a higher barrier to resistance development. This work reviews the use of chemicals that target cellular PKs as HDAs against virus of the Flaviviridae family (Flavivirus and Hepacivirus), thus being potentially valuable therapeutic targets in the control of these pathogens.","Blázquez, Ana-Belén; Saiz, Juan-Carlos",Int J Mol Sci,72,5

Data on vaccination coverage among migrants are not collected in EU, including Poland. Therefore, this qualitative study aimed to identify vaccination practices in this migrant group, to explore facilitators and barriers to vaccination and related access to Polish healthcare services. METHODS: In September 2019, a qualitative study of Ukrainian migrants (UMs) living in Szczecin, Poland, and recruited through a snowball sampling method, was conducted. Using a semi-structured topic guide, four focus groups were held with 22 UMs aged 18–45. Participants were asked about their attitudes towards vaccination in general with comparison between services in Poland and Ukraine. Following transcription and translation, a thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Respondents were distrustful of Ukrainian vaccination policy, medical personnel and individual vaccines, however, they often returned to Ukraine for dental and gynaecological appoint-ments. While critical with regards to registering with Polish GPs practices, UMs were confident in health professionals, as well as vaccine delivery. Vaccines were perceived as safer and of better quality than in Ukraine. Difficulties in translating vaccination records were rarely reported, verbal communi-cation was not problematic due to language similarities. All UM parents reported vaccinating their children according to the Polish schedule. However, a significant number of adult UMs have not completed mandatory vaccinations, although they may have obtained false immunization certificates; according to UMs those can be obtained by bribing. Participants reported lower acceptance of the influenza vaccine, mainly due to perceptions around its importance; none had been vaccinated against influenza. None of UMs had heard of the HPV vaccine. UMs experienced challenges in accessing credible online vaccination information in Ukrainian, no official local health authority vaccination material existed either, except for information about measles. CONCLUSIONS: This study pinpointed positive UM attitudes and practices regarding child vaccination in the Polish healthcare system and identified issues for improvement, such as adult vaccination. Health communication should be more tailored within UMs information delivery systems to enable migrants to make informed choices about vaccination. Further research is needed to better assess factors affecting vaccine uptake identified in this study.

These include methods for multimodal trip service areas, access to businesses and public services, diverse metrics of “walkability”, and the interpretation of location data. Infrastructure performance metrics in particular are an increasingly important means by which to understand and provide services to an urbanizing population. In contrast to traditional one-size-fits all analyses of street networks, as more detailed pedestrian-specific transportation network data becomes available, the opportunity arises to model the pedestrian network in terms of individual experiences. Here, we present a formalized and city-scale framework, personalized pedestrian network analysis (PPNA), for embedding and retrieving pedestrian experiences. PPNA enables evaluation of new, detailed, and open pedestrian transportation network data using a quantitative parameterization of a pedestrian’s preferences and requirements, producing one or more weighted network(s) that provide a basis for posing varied urban pedestrian experience research questions, with four approaches provided as examples. We introduce normalized sidewalk reach (NSR), a walkshed-based metric of individual pedestrian access to the sidewalk network, and sidewalk reach quotient (SRQ), an estimate of inequity based on comparing the normalized sidewalk reach values for different pedestrian profiles at the same location. Next, we investigate a higher-order and combinatorial research question that enumerates pedestrian network-based amenity access between pedestrians. Finally, we present city-scale betweenness centrality calculations between unique pedestrian experiences, highlighting disagreement between pedestrians on the “importance” of various pedestrian network corridors. Taken together, this framework and examples represent a significant emerging opportunity to promote the embedding of more explicit and inclusive hypotheses of pedestrian experience into research on urban pedestrian accessibility, multimodal transportation modeling, urban network analysis, and a broader range of research questions.","Bolten, Nicholas; Caspi, Anat",PLoS One,72,1

Exosomes derived from plasma exhibit potential to promote angiogenesis; meanwhile, the immune microenvironment plays a significant role in the process. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that plasma exosomes promote angiogenesis in irradiated tissue by mediating the immune microenvironment. First, we explored the impact of IR on macrophages. We found that cell viability and capacity for promoting angiogenesis were decreased in irradiated macrophages compared to control macrophages. Then, we isolated and characterized rat plasma-derived exosomes (RP-Exos) which were defined as 40–160 nm extracellular vesicles extracted from rat plasma. Afterward, we evaluated the effects of RP-Exos on the behaviors of irradiated macrophages. Our results show that RP-Exos promoted cell proliferation. More importantly, we found that RP-Exos stimulated the immune microenvironment in a manner that improved the angiogenesis-related genes and proteins of irradiated macrophages. The supernatant of macrophage cell cultures was used as conditioned medium to treat human primary umbilical vein endothelial cells, further confirming the pro-angiogenic ability of macrophages receiving RP-Exo intervention. RP-Exos were used in vivo to treat irradiated skin or calvarial defects in irradiated Sprague-Dawley male rats. The results indicated the ability of RP-Exos to enhance angiogenesis and promote tissue regeneration. Our research suggested the potential of plasma exosomes to be used as immunomodulatory agents with angiogenic capacity to treat radiation-associated vascular disorders and facilitate tissue repair.","Li, Yanxi; Lyu, Ping; Ze, Yiting; Li, Peiran; Zeng, Xinyi; Shi, Yixin; Qiu, Bingrun; Gong, Ping; Yao, Yang",PeerJ,72,1

The objective of this study was to describe racial and ethnic differences in self-reported health status, chronic conditions, and selected behavioral risk factors among prostate cancer survivors in the US. METHODS: We used data from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey to calculate the prevalence of various levels of health status, chronic conditions, behavioral risk factors, and sociodemographic characteristics among prostate cancer survivors aged 50 years or older. We stratified results by race and ethnicity. RESULTS: Of the 317 prostate cancer survivors in our sample, 33.1% reported no physical activity, 64.2% reported being current drinkers, 26.1% characterized their drinking as moderate/heavy, 42.3% reported being former smokers, and 8.7% were current smokers. Nearly one-third (29.1%) of survivors were obese (body mass index ≥30), and 15.1% had 3 to 6 chronic conditions. A greater percentage of White (29.7%) than Black (14.2%) or Hispanic (16.3%) survivors were moderate/heavy drinkers. A greater percentage of Black (16.2%) than White (7.5%) or Hispanic (7.3%) survivors were current smokers. A greater percentage of Black (25.1%) or Hispanic (27.7%) than White (11.4%) survivors had 3 to 6 chronic conditions. CONCLUSION: As the population of older men increases, prostate cancer diagnoses and those surviving the disease will also increase. Significant racial and ethnic group differences in behavioral risk factors and chronic conditions exist among prostate cancer survivors. Public health could prioritize efforts to improve health behaviors among prostate cancer survivors and use targeted interventions to address disparities.","Atere-Roberts, Joëlle; Gray, Simone C.; Hall, Ingrid J.; Smith, Judith Lee",Prev Chronic Dis,72,1

Overlap on the surface of parvovirus capsids between the antigenic epitope and the receptor binding site has contributed to cross-species transmission, giving rise to closely related variants. It has been shown that Mab 14 strongly binds and neutralizes canine but not feline parvovirus, suggesting this antigenic site also controls species-specific receptor binding. To visualize the conformational epitope at high resolution, we solved the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the Fab–virus complex. We also created custom software, Icosahedral Subparticle Extraction and Correlated Classification, to solve a Fab–virus complex with only a few Fab bound per capsid and visualize local structures of the Fab-bound and -unbound antigenic sites extracted from the same complex map. Our results identified the antigenic epitope that had significant overlap with the receptor binding site, and the structures revealed that binding of Fab induced conformational changes to the virus. We were also able to assign the order and position of attached Fabs to allow assessment of complementarity between the Fabs bound to different positions. This approach therefore provides a method for using cryo-EM to investigate complementarity of antibody binding.","Goetschius, Daniel J.; Hartmann, Samantha R.; Organtini, Lindsey J.; Callaway, Heather; Huang, Kai; Bator, Carol M.; Ashley, Robert E.; Makhov, Alexander M.; Conway, James F.; Parrish, Colin R.; Hafenstein, Susan L.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,72,1

We aim to conduct a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the effect of higher versus lower protein delivery (with similar energy delivery between groups) on clinical and patient-centered outcomes in critically ill patients. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and CINAHL from database inception through April 1, 2021.We included RCTs of (1) adult (age ≥ 18) critically ill patients that (2) compared higher vs lower protein with (3) similar energy intake between groups, and (4) reported clinical and/or patient-centered outcomes. We excluded studies on immunonutrition. Two authors screened and conducted quality assessment independently and in duplicate. Random-effect meta-analyses were conducted to estimate the pooled risk ratio (dichotomized outcomes) or mean difference (continuous outcomes). RESULTS: Nineteen RCTs were included (n = 1731). Sixteen studies used primarily the enteral route to deliver protein. Intervention was started within 72 h of ICU admission in sixteen studies. The intervention lasted between 3 and 28 days. In 11 studies that reported weight-based nutrition delivery, the pooled mean protein and energy received in higher and lower protein groups were 1.31 ± 0.48 vs 0.90 ± 0.30 g/kg and 19.9 ± 6.9 versus 20.1 ± 7.1 kcal/kg, respectively. Higher vs lower protein did not significantly affect overall mortality [risk ratio 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75–1.10, p = 0.34] or other clinical or patient-centered outcomes. In 5 small studies, higher protein significantly attenuated muscle loss (MD −3.44% per week, 95% CI −4.99 to −1.90; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients, a higher daily protein delivery was not associated with any improvement in clinical or patient-centered outcomes. Larger, and more definitive RCTs are needed to confirm the effect of muscle loss attenuation associated with higher protein delivery.

The sharing economy provides one method to address the imbalance between the demand and supply of health services to the older adult population. With a substantial aging population, China’s practices in the sharing aging industry may set examples for other “getting old before getting rich” countries. OBJECTIVE: There is a gap in both the data and research on China’s aging industry sharing economy. This paper addresses these data and research lacunae by constructing a framework for the application of a sharing model in China’s aging industry, by assessing the current state of the aging industry sharing economy, by setting out the challenges to the sharing aging health care and service economy, and by making recommendations for the development of the aging industry sharing economy. METHODS: This paper constructs a sharing economy framework in the aging industry covering four aspects (people, facilities, capital, and information) to test the current state and future prospects of China’s aging industry sharing economy. RESULTS: In people sharing, we analyzed the sharing of emotional companionship, doctors, nurses, nursing attendants, and domestic helpers. We discussed facility sharing models from the point of land and housing, medical devices, and other items such as pensioner meals and shared medicine bins. We acknowledge that crowdfunding platforms have developed fast in China, but many older adult users faced problems in their operation. Information sharing is a developing field, which can optimize users’ experiences and should help older adults filter out misinformation, but China currently does not have adequate sharing information platforms for older adults. CONCLUSIONS: We identified four major challenges in China’s aging industry sharing economy: poor adaptability to technology for older adults, mediocre quality of shared services, one-size-fits-all and the concept of the useless elderly, and shortage of qualified practitioners. We make recommendations for specific measures by governments, communities, and enterprises to improve the sharing economy in the aging industry.","Hu, Yaolin; Wang, Jian; Nicholas, Stephen; Maitland, Elizabeth",J Med Internet Res,72,1

This study extends prior research by examining home-school cultural value mismatch among a larger, multi-ethnic sample from Latinx, Asian and European American backgrounds (N = 155) in order to quantify the phenomenon and generalize it across multiple ethnic groups. Antecedents and consequences of different forms of mismatch were assessed in separate models. In modeling antecedents, we found that Latinx background, first-generation college status and low parental income were interconnected. However, among these three variables, it was first-generation college status that was the sole predictor of strong collectivistic motives for attending college; these motives were, in turn, associated with more frequent mismatch between family obligation and academic obligation. In addition, being female directly related to mismatch prevalence, as did living close to home. In modeling consequences of cultural value mismatch, frequent home-school cultural value mismatch predicted mental and physical health distress, which predicted academic problems; such problems were, in turn, related to lower grades. Our findings document the generalizability of this experience for first-generation college students from all ethnic backgrounds, as well as the unique experiences of students who identify as female or live close to home. Our findings also reveal the health and academic costs associated with this mismatch. Implications for research, intervention, and institutional change are discussed and have become increasingly important, given recent societal events that require most students to remain closer to home during distance learning.","Vasquez-Salgado, Yolanda; Greenfield, Patricia M.; Guan, Shu-Sha Angie",Front Psychol,72,1

We compared the change in percentage of persons in racial/ethnic groups at the Census block group level with varying levels of SCM installation (i.e., area-weighted SCM count at 300 m buffer). We stratified findings by SCM type, pre-installation income, and SCM size. DC installed a higher density of SCMs in areas with a higher percentage of Black and/or Hispanic/Latino residents. Nonetheless, findings suggest SCM installation is associated with displacement of Black residents. The percentage of residents who are Black decreased by 2.2% [95% Confidence Interval: 1.7, 2.7] and 4.1% [95% Confidence Interval: 3.4, 4.8] after low and high levels of SCM installation, respectively. In turn, the change in percentage of residents who are White increased with increasing levels of SCM installation. Compared to ecological studies on SCMs, studies about social impacts are scarce. This research intends to help optimize SCM installations so more residents can enjoy their health, economic, and ecological benefits.","Chan, Alisha Yee; Son, Ji-Young; Bell, Michelle Lee",Int J Environ Res Public Health,72,1

The Minnesota Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) surveillance program monitors hospitalizations due to acute respiratory illness and conducts systematic testing for several respiratory pathogens. We assessed viruses detected by the hospital and additional detections identified by expanded testing. METHODS: Residual upper respiratory specimens collected from patients hospitalized for suspected respiratory illness for routine diagnostic testing at three hospitals, including one children’s hospital, were submitted to the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH). Specimens were tested for 18 respiratory viruses by RT-PCR. Clinical and hospital test data were collected through medical record review. RESULTS: From September 2015 to August 2016, 2,351 hospitalized SARI patients were reported, with the following age distribution: 57% <5 years, 13% 5–17 years, 30% ≥18 years. Among all SARI patients, 97% (2,273) had hospital-based, clinician-directed testing for viral pathogens. Viruses were detected among 47% (1,077) of tested patients, among which testing methods included PCR (85%), rapid antigen (13%), and culture (2%); 74% were tested on the day of admission. Most common viruses detected by clinical testing included respiratory syncytial virus (41%), rhinovirus/enterovirus (31%), and influenza (15%) (Figure 1). Systematic RT–PCR testing at MDH identified 1,600 (68%) patients positive for ≥1 respiratory virus, identifying previously unknown detections among 35% (820) of SARI patients (Figure 2). Of 1,272 patients with no virus identified at the hospital, 46% (586) had a viral detection at MDH. Patients aged <18 years were significantly more likely to have an additional pathogen detected by MDH testing than those aged ≥18 years (P < 0.01), including rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and coronaviruses. CONCLUSION: Systematic, expanded testing at MDH identified a higher proportion of respiratory pathogens among SARI patients compared with clinical laboratory testing. Additional testing for clinically relevant respiratory pathogens may inform medical decision-making.

Surgical lung biopsy is the gold standard of diagnosis, but the diagnosis can be established in some cases by HRCT, provided the clinical features are consistent. The cause of IPF is unknown. However, IPF is more common in adults >60 years old, smokers (current or ex), and patients with specific occupational or noxious exposures. Familial IPF, associated with several distinct genetic mutations, accounts for 1.5–3% of cases. Unfortunately, the prognosis is poor, and most patients die of respiratory failure within 3–6 years of diagnosis. However, the course is highly variable. In some patients, the disease is fulminant, progressing to lethal respiratory failure within months, whereas the course may be indolent, spanning >5 years in some patients. Therapy has not been proven to alter the course of the disease or influence mortality, but recent studies with pirfenidone and tyrosine kinase inhibitors are promising. Lung transplantation is the best therapeutic option, but is limited to selected patients with severe, life-threatening disease and no contraindications to transplant.","Lynch, Joseph P.; Belperio, John A.",Diffuse Lung Disease,72,1

With a view to facilitating and expediting the release and clearance of goods carried by air, Contracting States are required to adopt regulations and procedures appropriate to air cargo operations and shall apply them in such a manner as to prevent unnecessary delays. Standards and Recommended Practices on Facilitation were first adopted by the Council on 25 March 1949, pursuant to the provisions of Article 37 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago, 1944), and designated as Annex 9 to the Convention with the title “Standards and Recommended Practices — Facilitation”. They became effective on 1 September 1949. To begin with, States are advised that with respect to cargo moving by both air and surface transport under an air waybill, Contracting States should apply the same regulations and procedures and in the same manner as they are applied to cargo moving solely by air. When introducing or amending regulations and procedures for the release and clearance of goods carried by air, Contracting States are required to l consult with aircraft operators and other parties concerned, with the aim of accomplishing the actions set forth in the Annex. Furthermore, Contracting States are required to develop procedures for the pre-arrival and pre-departure lodgement of an import and export goods declaration to enable expeditious release/clearance of the goods. Where the nature of a consignment could attract the attention of different public authorities, e.g. the customs, veterinary or sanitary controllers, Contracting States shall endeavour to delegate authority for release/clearance to customs or one of the other agencies or, where that is not feasible, take all necessary steps to ensure that release/clearance is coordinated and, if possible, carried out simultaneously and with a minimum of delay. Contracting States are not normally expected to require the physical examination of cargo to be imported or exported and are required to use risk management to determine which goods shall be examined and the extent of that examination. Where practicable, and with a view to improving efficiency, modern screening or examination techniques are required to be used to facilitate the physical examination of goods to be imported or exported.","Abeyratne, Ruwantissa",Law and Regulation of Air Cargo,72,1

However, mortality figures give only a partial measure of the toll asked by infectious diseases, and the global burden includes also health impact measured by disabilities, deformities, loss of productivity, care and treatment caused by a multitude of diseases like lymphatic filariasis, leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis, sleeping sickness and others. The impact of infectious diseases can be traced according to economic performance of African countries, showing that 34 out of 53 countries are classified as low-income economies. The disease burden is, however, more devastating since it affects all components of human development, including income, health and education. The impact of infectious diseases on African countries is no longer a crisis only for the healthcare sector, but presents a challenge to all sectors. It has the potential to reverse those gains made in human development in the last few years. Consequently, beyond health issues, these diseases should and must globally be seen as a development concern, affecting education and knowledge acquisition, income and social status, productivity and economic growth and other direct and indirect components of human development such as gender equality and human rights. For health strategies to be successful, international solidarity and public-private partnerships are needed to tackle the problems of shortage and lack of treatments, resistance and the need for new drugs, vaccines and diagnostic procedures.

These include various infections caused by influenza viruses, human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), human T-cell leukemia viruses (HTLV), Torque teno viruses (TTV), parvoviruses, adenoviruses, hepatitis B virus, polyomaviruses, herpesviruses, and papillomaviruses. Detection of viral RNA splicing for active viral gene expression in a clinical sample is a nucleic acid-based detection. The interpretation of the detected viral RNA splicing results is straightforward without concern for carry-over DNA contamination, because the spliced RNA is smaller than its corresponding DNA template. Although many methods can be used, a simple method to detect viral RNA splicing is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In principle, the detection of spliced RNA transcripts by RT-PCR depends on amplicon selection and primer design. The most common approach is the amplification over the intron regions by a set of primers in flanking exons. A larger product than the predicted size of smaller, spliced RNA is in general an unspliced RNA or contaminating viral genomic DNA. A spliced mRNA always gives a smaller RT-PCR product than its unspliced RNA due to removal of intron sequences by RNA splicing. The contaminating viral DNA can be determined by a minus RT amplification (PCR). Alternatively, specific amplification of a spliced RNA can be obtained by using an exon-exon junction primer because the sequence at exon-exon junction is not present in the unspliced RNA nor in viral genomic DNA.","Majerciak, Vladimir; Zheng, Zhi-Ming",Advanced Techniques in Diagnostic Microbiology,72,1

Scientific evidence has associated harmful health effects to indoor air hazards recognizing the existence of a vital concern in public health sector. Thus the assessment of human exposure to biological aerosols and droplets indoor became an imperative requirement of investigation. Environmental bioburden assessment of viruses relies in both culture-dependent approaches that comprise classical methodologies, still prominent and vital in the field of modern biotechnology, and culture-independent approaches based on nucleic acid amplification techniques, which are considered the gold standard in clinical virology. The main factor influencing indoor microbiology is the human being and their activities. Indoor environments to be considered are those regularly occupied by humans: residences, offices, schools, industrial buildings, health care facilities, farming activities and other settings occupied all the time, or in which occupant density is high. It’s well known that approximately 60% of total human respiratory and gastrointestinal infections are acquired indoor, since viruses have a rapid spread in the community and can be transmitted easily, especially in crowded and poorly ventilated environments, causing high morbidity and decline in quality of life and productivity. Studies have shown that respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, influenza and parainfluenza virus, and human enterovirus infections may be associated with virus-induced asthma, leading to diseases such as pneumonia. Gastroenteritis infectious (about 30±40% of cases) is attributable to viruses. Rotavirus, Astrovirus, Norwalk-like viruses and other caliciviruses are responsible for 48% of all reported outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease. Safe working conditions are essential for healthy living, that’s why the programmes conceived as a result of strategic and preventive policy maintenance, in refrigeration and ventilation systems, are the determining factor for the control of biological pollutants.

It is a matter of clinical importance that the incidence of various age-associated diseases such as infections, cancer, and vascular disorders increases with a decrease in immunological vigor. The extent of immunologic decline is variable and exhibits wide interindividual variations. Thus, it is important to assess the extent of immunologic decline in both patients suffering from various diseases and in healthy people in order to maintain healthy conditions. To this end, we have developed a scoring system that analyzes immune parameters according to a database of known age-associated immune changes obtained from a healthy population. Using this scoring system, we can combine several different immunological parameters and express the immune status of individuals as a simple numeral.

Computational methods for predicting TM sequences have been developed. These methods achieve high prediction accuracy for many TM proteins but some of these methods are less effective for specific class of TM proteins. Moreover, their performance has been tested by using a relatively small set of TM and non-membrane (NM) proteins. Thus it is useful to evaluate TM protein prediction methods by using a more diverse set of proteins and by testing their performance on specific classes of TM proteins. This work extensively evaluated the capability of support vector machine (SVM) classification systems for the prediction of TM proteins and those of several TM classes. These SVM systems were trained and tested by using 14962 TM and 12168 NM proteins from Pfam protein families. An independent set of 3389 TM and 6063 NM proteins from curated Pfam families were used to further evaluate the performance of these SVM systems. 90.1% and 86.7% of TM and NM proteins were correctly predicted respectively, which are comparable to those from other studies. The prediction accuracies for proteins of specific TM classes are 95.6%, 90.0%, 92.7% and 73.9% for G-protein coupled receptors, envelope proteins, outer membrane proteins, and transporters/channels respectively; and 98.1%, 99.5%, 86.4%, and 98.6% for non-G-protein coupled receptors, non-envelope proteins, non-outer membrane proteins, and non-transporters/non-channels respectively.

The indications for donor oocyte in vitro fertilization (IVF) have now expanded to include not only women with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism but also those with advanced reproductive age, diminished ovarian reserve, significant genetic disease risk, poor oocyte or embryo quality, or multiple failures in prior attempts to conceive using conventional assisted reproductive technology (ART). Oocyte donation has also been recently used as an important source of material to promote the study of stem cell research. In these first cases of donation, gametes were obtained primarily from women already undergoing IVF who had excess oocytes at the time of retrieval. Today, most egg donors are not currently pursing infertility treatment themselves but are willing to donate their gametes for altruistic or commercial reasons. Since its initiation, oocyte donation services have spread throughout the USA and to many areas of the world. In the USA, 9,000–10,000 donor oocyte cycles occur annually. Though donor oocyte IVF is available throughout the USA, globally the practice of oocyte donation varies due to legal restrictions in many countries (Chap. 30).","Nurudeen, Sahadat Kemi; Levine, Brian A.; Thornton, Melvin H.",Principles of Oocyte and Embryo Donation,72,1

Although remarkable technological advances have been made in the treatment of coronary heart disease, there is as yet no treatment that can sufficiently suppress the progression of atherosclerosis, including neointimal thickening. Therefore, a precise understanding of the mechanism of neointimal hyperplasia will provide the development of new technologies. Both ApoE-KO and LDLR-KO mice have been employed to generate other relevant mouse models of cardiovascular disease through breeding strategies. Although these mice are effective tools for the investigation of atherosclerosis, development of a progressive atherosclerotic lesion takes a long time, resulting in increase of both the costs and the space needed for the research. Thus, it is necessary to develop simpler tools that would allow easy evaluation of atherosclerosis in mouse models. In this review, we discuss our experience in generating mouse models of cuff-induced injury of the femoral artery and attempt to provide a better understanding of cuff-induced neointimal formation.","Kubota, Tetsuya; Kubota, Naoto",Mouse Models of Vascular Diseases,72,1

These distributions are manifested through some stochastic mechanisms. This chapter divides a typical outbreak in a closed population into two phases, the initial phase and beyond the initial phase. For the initial phase, this chapter addresses several aspects: the invasion (i.e. the risk of a large outbreak); quantities associated with a small outbreak; and characteristics of a large outbreak. In a large outbreak beyond the initial phase, the focus is on its final size. After a review of distribution theories and stochastic processes, this chapter separately addresses each of these issues by asking questions such as: Are the latent period and/or the infectious period distributions playing any role? What is the role of the contact process for this issue? Is the basic reproduction number R (0) sufficient to address this issue? How many stochastic mechanisms may manifest observations that may resemble a power-law distribution, and how much detail is really needed to address this specific issue? etc. This chapter uses distribution theory and stochastic processes to capture the agent–host–environment interface during an outbreak of an infectious disease. With different phases of an outbreak and special issues in mind, modellers need to choose which detailed aspects of the distributions and the stochastic mechanisms need to be included, and which detailed aspects need to be ignored. With these discussions, this chapter provides some syntheses for the concepts and models discussed in some proceeding chapters, as well as some food for thought for following chapters on case studies.","Yan, Ping",Mathematical Epidemiology,72,17

Moreover, new pathogens transmitted by ticks have recently been recognized in animals and humans from diverse regions of the globe, widely separated in distance. These include new phleboviruses of the Bunyaviridae family, exemplified by severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus [SFTSV] recognized in China in 2010, and the Heartland virus, a closely related but distinct virus, presenting with similar clinical features and discovered in Missouri in 2012. Other newly recognized tickborne infections include a novel spirochete of the relapsing fever group, Borrelia miyamotoi, first reported to cause human infection in Russia in 2011 and subsequently discovered to cause clinical disease in the Netherlands, Japan, and the United States, with transmission by the black-legged deer tick Ixodes scapularis. In Europe a new tickborne disease, neoehrlichiosis caused by Candidatus neoehrlichia mikurensis belonging to the Anaplasmataceae family, has been described recently. Furthermore, new tickborne rickettsial infections continue to be recognized in Europe such as tickborne lymphadenopathy identified in 1997 and caused by Rickettsia slovaca. Novel tickborne infectious diseases will continue to emerge worldwide for the foreseeable future and be a challenge to the health of human populations.

Recent studies have identified a family of soluble proinflammatory molecules called chemokines that are able to direct leukocyte infiltration into the CNS in response to infection or injury. Identification of chemokines within and around demyelinating lesions in MS patients indicate a potential role for these molecules in contributing to the pathogenesis of MS. To address this issue, we have used mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection of the CNS to understand the dynamic interaction of chemokine expression as it relates to inflammation and neuropathology. Our results indicate that chemokine expression within the CNS results in persistent recruitment of both T lymphocytes and macrophages and results in subsequent myelin destruction. Herein, we demonstrate the complexity of the chemokine response to MHV infection of the CNS and the delicate balance that exists between host defense and development of disease.","Trifilo, Matthew J.; Liu, Michael T.; Glass, William G.; Lane, Thomas E.",Experimental Models of Multiple Sclerosis,72,1

However, the exact properties that make such adapted contact recommendation models effective at the task are as yet unknown. In this paper, inspired by new advances in the axiomatic theory of IR, we study the existing IR axioms for the contact recommendation task. Our theoretical analysis and empirical findings show that while the classical axioms related to term frequencies and term discrimination seem to have a positive impact on the recommendation effectiveness, those related to length normalization tend to be not desirable for the task.","Sanz-Cruzado, Javier; Macdonald, Craig; Ounis, Iadh; Castells, Pablo",Advances in Information Retrieval,72,0

As detection and isolation methods have improved, a growing number of pathogens have been identified as important food- and waterborne pathogens. This chapter describes the use of nucleic acid and antibody probes that have the potential to circumvent the need to culture the organism prior to identification. Nucleic acid probes have become a valuable diagnostic reagent in the identification of human and animal pathogens and have made possible the identification of viruses and bacteria that are difficult, if not impossible, to cultivate.

When bacteria invade tissues, they almost inevitably cause some damage, and this is also true for fungi and protozoa. Cell and tissue damage are sometimes due to the direct local action of the microorganism and microbial toxins. They either interfere with the transcription, translation, and DNA synthesis or change the permeability of the cell membrane. Some of the indirect damage brought about by these microbes is through inflammation and immune responses. Host cells are destroyed or blood vessels injured as a direct result of the action of microbes or their toxins. Inflammatory materials are liberated from necrotic cells, whatever the cause of the necrosis. Also many bacteria themselves liberate inflammatory products and certain viruses cause living infected cells to release inflammatory mediators. The expression of the immune response necessarily involves a certain amount of inflammation, cell infiltration, lymph node swelling, even tissue destruction. Sometimes they are very severe, leading to serious disease or death, but at other times they play a minimal part in the pathogenesis of disease. Other indirect mechanisms of damage include stress, hemorrhage, placental infection, and tumors.","Mims, Cedric A.; Nash, Anthony; Stephen, John",Mims' Pathogenesis of Infectious Disease,72,1

A polymerase chain reaction based molecular test is currently the most sensitive diagnostic tool for HPAIV; however, the results must be analyzed in centralized diagnosis systems by a trained individual. This requirement leads to delays in quarantine and isolation. To control the spread of HPAIV, rapid and accurate diagnostics suitable for field testing are needed, and the tests must facilitate a differential diagnosis between HPAIV and low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV), which undergo cleavage specifically by trypsin‐ or furin‐like proteases, respectively. In this study, a differential avian influenza virus rapid test kit is developed and evaluated in vitro and using clinical specimens from HPAIV H5N1‐infected animals. It is demonstrated that this rapid test kit provides highly sensitive and specific detection of HPAIV and LPAIV and is thus a useful field diagnostic tool for H5N1 HPAIV outbreaks and for rapid quarantine control of the disease.","Kim, Hyun‐Ouk; Na, Woonsung; Yeom, Minjoo; Choi, Jihye; Kim, Jihye; Lim, Jong‐Woo; Yun, Dayeon; Chun, Haejin; Park, Geunseon; Park, Chaewon; Kim, Jeong‐Ki; Jeong, Dae Gwin; Le, Van Phan; Lee, Kwangyeol; Lee, Jae Myun; Jeong, Hyoung Hwa; Song, Daesub; Haam, Seungjoo",Adv Funct Mater,72,5

This was subject to malacological studies from the late 19th century onwards. Herein, we provide the first thorough taxonomic survey of Lake Gacko including revisions of several taxa. A total amount of 1,077 specimens was obtained from 17 samples, comprising at least 11 freshwater and 2 terrestrial gastropod species and 6 bivalve species. So far, none of the described taxa has been documented outside the Dinarides and the DLS, respectively. The fauna shows variable overlap with other paleolakes of the DLS, proofing once more the complex biogeographic patchwork of this system. The current paleoenvironmental reconstructions are tested and refined by application of a statistical analysis. This confirms the partition of the sedimentary history of Lake Gacko into three major depositional phases responding to astronomically forced climate changes. The low diverse mollusk assemblage in the initial phase, with abundant pulmonate and rissooid gastropods, signals a more arid climate with lowered lake level. During the second interval, the fauna becomes more diverse with common rissooid and melanopsid gastropods. It represents a more humid interval with enhanced precipitation and increased lake level, entailing the installation of a perennial lacustrine environment. The final phase is a return to arid conditions with the same elements as in the initial pulmonate‐rissooid assemblage. The sphaeriid Pisidium vukovici n. sp. is introduced as new species.

In this paper, we propose Cascaded multi-Structure Neural Network (CSNN), a novel and unified model that extract inter-sentence or implicit causal relations from Chinese Corpus, without relying on external knowledge. The model employs Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to capture important features as well as causal structural pattern. Self-attention mechanism is designed to mine semantic and relevant characteristics between different features. The output of CNN and self-attention structure are concatenated as higher-level phrase representations. Then Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer is employed to calculate the label of each word in inter-sentence or implicit causal relation sentences, which improves the performance of inter-sentence or implicit causality extraction.

It is well known that Chinese sentences with different polysemous words or word order may have totally different semantic meanings. Thus, to represent and match the sentence semantic meaning accurately, one challenge that must be solved is how to capture the semantic features from the multi-granularity perspective, e.g., characters and words. To address the above challenge, we propose a novel sentence semantic matching model which is based on the fusion of semantic features from character-granularity and word-granularity, respectively. Particularly, the multi-granularity fusion intends to extract more semantic features to better optimize the downstream sentence semantic matching. In addition, we propose the equilibrium cross-entropy, a novel loss function, by setting mean square error (MSE) as an equilibrium factor of cross-entropy. The experimental results conducted on Chinese open data set demonstrate that our proposed model combined with binary equilibrium cross-entropy loss function is superior to the existing state-of-the-art sentence semantic matching models.","Zhang, Xu; Lu, Wenpeng; Zhang, Guoqiang; Li, Fangfang; Wang, Shoujin",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,72,1

However, these approaches focus on unconditioned generation, which limits their control over the generating procedure to produce graphs in context, thus limiting the applicability to real-world settings. To address this gap, we introduce an attention-based graph evolution model (AGE). AGE is a conditional graph generator based on the neural attention mechanism that can not only model graph evolution in both space and time, but can also model the transformation between graphs from one state to another. We evaluate AGE on multiple conditional graph-generation tasks, and our results show that it can generate realistic graphs conditioned on source graphs, outperforming existing methods in terms of quality and generality.","Fan, Shuangfei; Huang, Bert",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,72,1

However, these signals are problematic in situations e.g., in dynamic moving environments where the user cannot relax with all the sensors attached to the body and it provides significant noises in the signals. This paper presents a case study using a contact-free approach for CL classification based on Heart Rate Variability (HRV) collected from ECG signal. Here, a contact-free approach i.e., a camera-based system is compared with a contact-based approach i.e., Shimmer GSR+ system in detecting CL. To classify CL, two different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, mainly, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest-Neighbor (k-NN) have been applied. Based on the gathered Inter-Beat-Interval (IBI) values from both the systems, 13 different HRV features were extracted in a controlled study to determine three levels of CL i.e., S0: low CL, S1: normal CL and S2: high CL. To get the best classification accuracy with the ML algorithms, different optimizations such as kernel functions were chosen with different feature matrices both for binary and combined class classifications. According to the results, the highest average classification accuracy was achieved as 84% on the binary classification i.e. S0 vs S2 using k-NN. The highest F(1) score was achieved 88% using SVM for the combined class considering S0 vs (S1 and S2) for contact-free approach i.e. the camera system. Thus, all the ML algorithms achieved a higher classification accuracy while considering the contact-free approach than contact-based approach.","Ahmed, Mobyen Uddin; Begum, Shahina; Gestlöf, Rikard; Rahman, Hamidur; Sörman, Johannes",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,72,1

However, in many applications, it is enough to have an approximation of the conformance value. Specifically, for large event data, the computation time for alignments is considerably long using current techniques which makes them inapplicable in reality. Also, it is no longer feasible to use standard hardware for complex process models. This paper, proposes new approximation techniques to compute approximated conformance checking values close to exact solution values in less time. These methods also provide upper and lower bounds for the approximated alignment value. Our experiments on real event data show that it is possible to improve the performance of conformance checking by using the proposed methods compared to using the state-of-the-art alignment approximation technique. Results show that in most of the cases, we provide tight bounds, accurate approximated alignment values, and similar deviation statistics.","Fani Sani, Mohammadreza; van Zelst, Sebastiaan J.; van der Aalst, Wil M.

Such regulations would not directly protect vulnerable road users (VRUs) who form the main bulk of Sri Lankan and South Asian automobile trauma casualties. With the objective of reviewing the management outcome of automobile trauma in order to correlate the potential impact of new legislation on injury prevention, data of all admitted road traffic injury victims were audited for 2 months. Out of 473 eligible cases (332 (70.2%)—males; mean age 37.2 years), there were 14 (3%) fatalities. Of 459 (97%) survivors, 77 (16%) suffered major injuries. Twelve out of 14 (85.7%) fatalities, 64 of 77 (83.1%) survivors with major injuries and 263 of 382 (68.8%) cases of lesser injuries were VRUs (p value = 0.02: chi-square). VRUs had a significantly higher mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 10.96 ± 8.43 SD than non-VRUs who had a mean ISS of 8.14 ± 6.04 SD (p = 0.003: t test). Among all survivors, 33/39 (84.6%) with permanent disability, 95/110 (86.4%) with temporary disability and 199/310 (64.2%) with no residual disability were VRUs (p value < 0.0001: chi-square).

Results denote that VRUs suffer significant majority of the fatalities and major injuries after road traffic trauma and to have higher residual temporary/permanent disability among survivors. Recent compulsory motor vehicle safety measures are unlikely to directly protect majority of automobile trauma victims in Sri Lanka. To obtain a higher impact on road traffic injury prevention, main emphasis has to be given to improve the safety standards of VRUs in developing countries.","Lakmal, M. A. C.; Ekanayake, E. M. D. N.

However, the questions have to be assessed as well and, although it is possible to estimate with IRT the characteristics of questions that have already been answered by several students, this technique cannot be used on newly generated questions. In this paper, we propose a framework to train and evaluate models for estimating the difficulty and discrimination of newly created Multiple Choice Questions by extracting meaningful features from the text of the question and of the possible choices. We implement one model using this framework and test it on a real-world dataset provided by CloudAcademy, showing that it outperforms previously proposed models, reducing by 6.7% the RMSE for difficulty estimation and by 10.8% the RMSE for discrimination estimation. We also present the results of an ablation study performed to support our features choice and to show the effects of different characteristics of the questions’ text on difficulty and discrimination.","Benedetto, Luca; Cappelli, Andrea; Turrin, Roberto; Cremonesi, Paolo",Artificial Intelligence in Education,72,7

We characterize this deployment as both high stakes (the questions were on an mid-term exam worth 10% of students’ final grade) and high transparency (the question was graded interactively during the computer-based exam and correct solutions were shown to students that could be compared to their answer). We study two techniques designed to mitigate the potential student dissatisfaction resulting from students incorrectly not granted credit by the imperfect AI grader. We find (1) that providing multiple attempts can eliminate first-attempt false negatives at the cost of additional false positives, and (2) that students not granted credit from the algorithm cannot reliably determine if their answer was mis-scored.","Azad, Sushmita; Chen, Binglin; Fowler, Maxwell; West, Matthew; Zilles, Craig",Artificial Intelligence in Education,72,33

Firstly, in order to reduce a influence of system uncertainties and external disturbances, a sliding mode controller is designed based on an exponential approach law. Then the error asymptotic convergence of the trajectory tracking control is proven by the Lyapunov-like function. Finally, the effectiveness of the sliding mode controller is verified by rich simulation. Results show that the designed controller can not only realize the coordination control of UVMS accurately, but also can eliminate the chattering of control signal.","Tang, Qirong; Hong, Yang; Deng, Zhenqiang; Jin, Daopeng; Li, Yinghao",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,72,33

However, the molecular evolution and domestication of pogo transposons, once designated as an important family of the Tc1/mariner superfamily, are still poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, phylogenetic analysis show that pogo transposases, together with Tc1/mariner, DD34E/Gambol, and Zator transposases form four distinct monophyletic clades with high bootstrap supports (> = 74%), suggesting that they are separate superfamilies of ITm group. The pogo superfamily represents high diversity with six distinct families (Passer, Tigger, pogoR, Lemi, Mover, and Fot/Fot-like) and wide distribution with an expansion spanning across all the kingdoms of eukaryotes. It shows widespread occurrences in animals and fungi, but restricted taxonomic distribution in land plants. It has invaded almost all lineages of animals—even mammals—and has been domesticated repeatedly in vertebrates, with 12 genes, including centromere-associated protein B (CENPB), CENPB DNA-binding domain containing 1 (CENPBD1), Jrk helix–turn–helix protein (JRK), JRK like (JRKL), pogo transposable element derived with KRAB domain (POGK), and with ZNF domain (POGZ), and Tigger transposable element-derived 2 to 7 (TIGD2–7), deduced as originating from this superfamily. Two of them (JRKL and TIGD2) seem to have been co-domesticated, and the others represent independent domestication events. Four genes (TIGD3, TIGD4, TIGD5, and POGZ) tend to represent ancient domestications in vertebrates, while the others only emerge in mammals and seem to be domesticated recently. Significant structural variations including target site duplication (TSD) types and the DDE triad signatures (DD29–56D) were observed for pogo transposons. Most domesticated genes are derived from the complete transposase genes; but CENPB, POGK, and POGZ are chimeric genes fused with additional functional domains. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to systematically reveal the evolutionary profiles of the pogo transposons, suggesting that pogo and Tc1/Mariner are two separate superfamilies of ITm group, and demonstrating the repeated domestications of pogo in vertebrates. These data indicate that pogo transposons have played important roles in shaping the genome and gene evolution of fungi and animals. This study expands our understanding of the diversity of pogo transposons and updates the classification of ITm group.","Gao, Bo; Wang, Yali; Diaby, Mohamed; Zong, Wencheng; Shen, Dan; Wang, Saisai; Chen, Cai; Wang, Xiaoyan; Song, Chengyi",Mob DNA,72,1

The two proportional modes are referred to as neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) and proportional assist ventilation with load-adjustable gain factors (PAV+): they deliver inspiratory assist in proportion to the patient’s effort, and hence directly respond to changes in ventilatory needs. Due to their working principles, NAVA and PAV+ have the ability to provide self-adjusted lung and diaphragm-protective ventilation. As these proportional modes differ from ‘classical’ modes such as pressure support ventilation (PSV), setting the inspiratory assist level is often puzzling for clinicians at the bedside as it is not based on usual parameters such as tidal volumes and PaCO(2) targets. This paper provides an in-depth overview of the working principles of NAVA and PAV+ and the physiological differences with PSV. Understanding these differences is fundamental for applying any assisted mode at the bedside. We review different methods for setting inspiratory assist during NAVA and PAV+ , and (future) indices for monitoring of patient effort. Last, differences with automated modes are mentioned.","Jonkman, Annemijn H.; Rauseo, Michela; Carteaux, Guillaume; Telias, Irene; Sklar, Michael C.; Heunks, Leo; Brochard, Laurent J.",Intensive Care Med,72,1

Its principle is to identify which elementary communication actions can be immediately executed, and then to compute, for every such action, a new interaction representing the possible continuations to its execution. We also define an algorithm for checking the validity of execution traces (i.e. whether or not they belong to an interaction’s semantics).

Due to the increasingly aging critically ill population, investigation on age- and BMI-specific energy metabolism is relevant. METHODS: A total of 394 indirect calorimetry measurements were conducted on 348 critically ill adult medical patients, including 46 repeat measurements after 3.6 ± 4.3 days. Measured resting energy expenditure (MREE) was compared for age groups, BMI, and gender. Predicted energy expenditure (PEE) using the Penn State, Swinamer, and Ireton-Jones equations and the ACCP recommendations was also compared with MREE. RESULTS: The patients were 65.6 ± 14.5 years old. Their mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was 27.6 ± 7.8. Mean BMI was 27.8 ± 8.4 kg/m(2), and 25.6% were obese. MREE adjusted for ideal body weight decreased with increasing age, while it increased with increasing BMI. Age, BMI, and gender are independent determinants of MREE after adjusting for clinical factors (R(2) = 0.34). All four prediction equations showed a proportional bias, with the Penn State equation performing acceptably. In 46 patients with repeat indirect calorimetry, there was no significant difference between the first and second MREE (p = 0.62). CONCLUSIONS: Age, BMI, and gender are independent determinants of resting energy expenditure in critically ill adults. Variations between measured and predicted energy expenditure are considerable. Should prediction equations be used, their performance in the specific population should be taken into consideration. Repeat indirect calorimetry may not always be necessary. However, this may depend on the length of stay and the extent of stress.","Hölzel, Christin; Weidhase, Lorenz; Petros, Sirak",Eur J Clin Nutr,72,19

On 7 March 2020, there were more than 100,000 confirmed cases in 88 countries. Telemedicine, otherwise known as telehealth, has been used at small scale in past outbreaks, including previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS; MERS) and other PHEICs (Ebola; Zika). The objective was to describe the global larger scale use and practicality of telehealth in the COVID-19 outbreak. The 2015 conceptual framework of telemedicine during an outbreak for epidemiological assessment and clinical management (Ohannessian R.) was used to describe the use cases. A multi-country analysis from China, France, USA and UK was performed with a literature review using official institution websites, grey literature, media/business reports, as scientific articles were not yet published. Video and chat consultations were used for symptomatic patient assessments through private telehealth providers in all countries. In the USA, the Telehealth Services During Certain Emergency Periods Act of 2020 was voted by the Congress on 4 March 2020 to suspend restrictive rules of Medicare funding for telehealth home consultations. Triage via online auto-questionnaires were created by private providers and public authorities. In the UK, from 26 February to 2 March, 70,000 enquiries were made to a dedicated NHS111 online service. In China, teleradiology networks were also used for diagnostic of COVID-19 cases. Video consultation was used in France to monitor home isolated patients and non COVID-19 patients, to avoid risks of exposure. Telehealth has been useful to the COVID-19 outbreak but efforts to better describe cases and evaluate impact on the public health response should be promoted. National and international health authorities should be aware of the opportunities offered by telehealth during outbreaks, and may consider its integration in public health emergencies preparedness plans. KEY MESSAGES: Telehealth was useful for the public health response to COVID19 outbreak. Telehealth should be integrated into public health preparedness plans.","Ohannessian, R; Yaghobian, S",Eur J Public Health,72,1

RESULTS: In the early phase (n = 60), 32 patients had negative CT findings and 28 patients had positive findings with a mean total lung severity score of 2.13. In the intermediate phase (n = 116), 4 patients had negative CT findings and 112 patients had positive findings with a mean total lung severity score of 16.08. In the late phase (n = 36), all patients had positive findings with a mean total lung severity score of 17.83. CT lung abnormalities were progressed on follow-up CT studies. We found a high total lung severity score in many patients with mild symptoms with a mean of 14.77 and a low total lung severity score in many patients with moderate to severe symptoms with a mean of 9.14.

These circumstances deprived families of opportunities to say goodbye or memorialize the death of their loved one in alignment with their values and cultural heritage (e.g., wakes/vigils, funerals, shiva, washing, shrouding, military honors). Unable to hold hands, have final conversations, or develop treatment plans with providers, bereaved families experienced compounded losses. Concurrent quarantine hindered their engagement in coping strategies. COVID-19 bereavement increases the risk for complicated grief, which escalates the risk of physical and mental health problems, suicide, drug abuse, and family discord (Shear, 2015, 2020). While death, grief, and mourning are normal life experiences, traumatic and sudden death during a global pandemic is a new domain and the voices of those left behind are under-represented in social discourse. Simultaneously, psychologists and trainees quickly became last responders. COVID-19 presented a constellation of clinical challenges. Practitioners provided care during a time of political and racial tension, civil unrest, school closures, health and financial insecurity, and a collective loss of normalcy. Additionally, COVID-19 cast a spotlight on ageist attitudes and critical need for increased representation of older adults in training curricula. These issues echo the call to embrace aging as a valued aspect of diversity, and to strengthen psychology’s workforce in the areas of training, practice, research and advocacy for aging adults (Hoge, et al., 2015). This poster will explore the impact of COVID-19 bereavement on families and practitioners, promote advocacy efforts, and offer tangible training recommendations for psychology programs.","Hogan, Jacqueline; Richards, Lisa",Innov Aging,72,16

The study also highlighted the intrinsic idiosyncratic nature of small firms’ ecosystems, and the fact that government resources and services provided by companies, both private and public, could effectively reduce the costs associated with e-business adoption.","Mkansi, Marcia",Electron Commer Res,72,16

Recently a link between high-risk plaque (HRP) features and myocardial ischemia, in the absence of severe lumen stenosis, has been evidenced. Nonobstructive coronary artery disease (nonob CAD) has been associated in fact with a greater 1-year risk of myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality compared with no apparent CAD. This new evidence increases interest in searching new triggers to identify these high-risk patients, in the absence/or on top of traditional hazard markers. In this study, we investigated the existence of any association between RBC morphodynamics and HRP features in individuals with different grades of coronary stenosis detected by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Ninety-one consecutive individuals who underwent CCTA [33 no CAD; 26 nonobstructive (nonob), and 32 obstructive (ob) CAD] were enrolled. RBC morphodynamic features, i.e., RBC aggregability and deformability, were analyzed by means of Laser Assisted Optical Rotation Cell Analyzer (LoRRca MaxSis). The putative global RBC morphodynamic (RMD) score and the related risk chart, associating the extent of HRP (e.g., the non-calcified plaque volume) with both the RMD score and the max % stenosis were computed. In nonob CAD group only positive correlations between RBC rigidity, osmotic fragility or aggregability and HRP features (plaque necrotic core, fibro-fatty and fibro-fatty plus necrotic core plaque volumes) were highlighted. Interestingly, in this patient cohort three of these RBC morphodynamic features result to be independent predictors of the presence of non-calcified plaque volume in this patients group. The risk chart created shows that only in nonob CAD plaque vulnerability increases according to the score quartile. Findings of this work, by evidencing the association between erythrocyte morphodynamic characteristics assessed by LoRRca and plaque instability in a high-risk cohort of nonob CAD, suggest the use of these blood cell features in the identification of high-risk patients, in the absence of severe coronary stenosis.","Porro, Benedetta; Conte, Edoardo; Zaninoni, Anna; Bianchi, Paola; Veglia, Fabrizio; Barbieri, Simone; Fiorelli, Susanna; Eligini, Sonia; Di Minno, Alessandro; Mushtaq, Saima; Tremoli, Elena; Cavalca, Viviana; Andreini, Daniele",Front Physiol,72,1

Such an approach, however, is inappropriate in the markets of artificial intelligence devices. In fact, according to the current paradigm of civil liability, compensation is allowed only to the extent that “someone” is identified as a debtor. However, in many cases it would not be useful to impose the obligation to pay such compensation to producers and programmers: the algorithms, in fact, can “behave” far independently from the instructions initially provided by programmers so that they can err despite no flaw in design or implementation. Therefore, application of “traditional” civil liability to AI may represent a disincentive to new technologies based on artificial intelligence. This is why I think artificial intelligence requires that the law evolves, on this matter, from an issue of civil liability into one of financial management of losses. No-fault redress schemes could be an interesting and worthy regulatory strategy in order to enable this evolution. Of course, such schemes should apply only in cases where there is no evidence that producers and programmers have acted under conditions of negligence, imprudence or unskillfulness and their activity is adequately compliant with scientifically validated standards.","Marchisio, Emiliano",SN Soc Sci,72,16

In this project, we initially created a benchmark (NZ-Traffic-Sign 3K) for the traffic-sign recognition in New Zealand. In order to determine which deep learning models are the most suitable one for the TSR, we choose two kinds of models to conduct deep learning computations: Faster R-CNN and YOLOv5.

It sought to achieve gender equality over three years, and key among its strategies was a 5050 gender equality target in funding. In April 2018, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) followed suite and published its Gender Action Plan. Both policies were broadly welcomed as a much-needed intervention in a male-dominated industry. How has the Six Point Plan translated into action over its three-year term and why did it fail to deliver full gender equality within the stated time? This chapter is concerned with understanding why a policy with radical potential failed to deliver. It will revisit the aims of that policy; the initiatives introduced during the period and the outcomes achieved. It will also examine Screen Ireland’s more recent stated support for “5050 by 2020” and evaluate whether this signals a new policy direction or if it merely indicates a continuity of aspirational support for gender equality more broadly. Similarly, the policy and progress of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) and its Gender Action Plan will be evaluated, notwithstanding the fact that it was developed later than that of Screen Ireland. The chapter will also appraise the input of professional and representative bodies such as the Writers Guild of Ireland (WGI), the Screen Directors Guild of Ireland (SDGI) and Women in Film and Television Ireland (WFT Ireland). It will tease out industry reaction and point to the direction that 5050 by 2020 might productively take if gender equality is to be achieved in the short to medium term.","Liddy, Susan",Women in the International Film Industry,72,11

Fingerprinting and watermarking are well explored in the domain of multimedia content, such as images, video, or audio. The domain of relational databases is explored specifically for numerical data types, for which most state-of-art techniques are designed. However, many datasets also, or even exclusively, contain categorical data. We, therefore, propose a novel approach for fingerprinting categorical type of data, focusing on preserving the semantic relations between attributes, and thus limiting the perceptibility of marks, and the effects of the fingerprinting on the data quality and utility.

As Jocelynne Scutt relates, inevitably, redress is sometimes pursued through law. She details the ways in which compensation or damages may be sought and sometimes gained through tort law, ranging through negligence, vicarious liability, volenti non fit injuria, and contributory negligence—where the woman is deemed partially responsible for the injury claimed. She refers to contract law and addresses consumer protection laws, product liability and claims against manufacturers, distributors and end users, whether surgeons, beauticians, hairdressers or casual workers applying products in pop-up ‘clinics’, hotel rooms or in the home. Finally, as Jocelynne Scutt reports, criminal liability can lie, too. Consent, in both criminal and civil law, is fundamental. In medical negligence, consent is based in notions of patient autonomy, a right to information and the duty of the surgeon or other beauty practitioner to provide it. So, what if treatment is requested not for life-saving reasons or well-defined well-being, but for body enhancement and manipulation based in fashion?

The service sector is a large and growing contributor to international trade and to internationalization. The cross-border provision of services varies by service sub-sector and product. Services businesses play two roles in the on-going development of global economic activity. First, they are internationalizing by foreign direct investment (FDI), mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and by developing approaches to service delivery to meet the needs of clients in many different locations. This reflects different forms of direct internationalization in which services are locally produced and consumed or exported or indirect internationalization in which services are embedded and exported within physical goods and within other services. Second, service businesses provide the supporting service infrastructure to support trade and FDI in goods, raw materials and in the provision of other services.

Specifically, we show that every algorithm that uses our group is algebraic, and hence “must know” a representation of its output group elements in terms of its input group elements. Here, “must know” means that a suitable extractor can extract such a representation efficiently. We stress that our implementation relies only on falsifiable assumptions in the standard model, and in particular does not use any knowledge assumptions. As a consequence, our group allows to transport a number of results obtained in the AGM into the standard model, under falsifiable assumptions. For instance, we show that in our group, several Diffie-Hellman-like assumptions (including computational Diffie-Hellman) are equivalent to the discrete logarithm assumption. Furthermore, we show that our group allows to prove the Schnorr signature scheme tightly secure in the random oracle model. Our construction relies on indistinguishability obfuscation, and hence should not be considered as a practical group itself. However, our results show that the AGM is a realistic computational model (since it can be instantiated in the standard model), and that results obtained in the AGM are also possible with standard-model groups.","Agrikola, Thomas; Hofheinz, Dennis; Kastner, Julia",Advances in Cryptology - EUROCRYPT 2020,72,18

In this paper, we demonstrate that in the frame of the gradual provision of information from the individual scientific disciplines, taking into account their respective potential and limitations, a multidisciplinary approach is able to address more efficiently rapid response issues in order to allow effective preliminary interpretation of the earthquake activity, even within the first 24 h of the event. It focuses on the assessment of the timely provision of information by each discipline, evaluating the access to primary data sources as well as the maturity of the techniques in terms of accuracy and rapid data processing. Within a period of less than a week, several constraints were partially compensated for, allowing the delivery of more robust results and interpretation. The study highlights the readiness level of the various domains that has been significantly improved over the past years, including rapid seismological solutions, systematic availability of free and open Earth Observation data and on-demand online processing through dedicated platforms. Their combination with routinely applied inversion modelling and timely in situ observation is leading to improved operational response levels.

Little Indian data is available about the prevalence of diabetes in COVID 19 and its impact on outcomes. This observational prospective study (approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee) was carried out in a designated COVID facility, largely catering to middle and upper socioeconomic classes. A total of 401 (125 F, mean age 54 y, range 19–92 y) consecutive adults hospitalized with COVID-19 infection as proven by positive nasal swab for SARS-CoV2 by RT-PCR were included. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed either by known history or HbA1c≥6.5%. Severity was assessed using the WHO ordinal scale(1). Clinical outcomes and markers of inflammation were compared between diabetes and non-diabetes groups. Out of 401 patients, 210 (52.4%) had either diabetes (189,47.1%) or hyperglycemia requiring insulin treatment (21, 5.2%). 152 (37.9%) reported known diabetes, and 37 (9.2%) had preexisting but undiagnosed diabetes (HbA1c≥ 6.5%). People with diabetes were significantly older (mean age 59.9 vs 47.7 y), and had a higher proportion of men (74.6 vs 63.7 %), hypertension (58.7 vs 25%), CAD (13.8 vs 4.2%), and CKD (5.3 vs 0.9%) and a higher mean baseline severity score (3.4±0.7 vs. 3.2±0.5, p-0.000). The diabetes group had a higher number of severe cases (WHO scale≥5) (20.1% vs 9%, p-0.002) and higher mortality (6.3 vs 1.4%, p-0.015). A higher proportion of the diabetes group required ICU admissions (24.3 vs 12.3%, p-0.002), glucocorticoid therapy (78.3 vs 54.2%, p-0.000), oxygen administration (53.4 vs 28.3%, p-0.000), inotropic support (7.4 vs 2.4%, p-0.019), and renal replacement therapy (3.7% vs 0,p-0.005). The mean duration of hospital stay was higher for the diabetes group (10.4 vs 9.1 days, p-0.016). Of those who died, 12/15 (80%) had diabetes. Baseline Hba1c (n=331) showed a significant correlation with outcome severity scores (r 0.136, p-0.013). Markers of inflammatory response, CRP (41.0±4.4 vs. 19.4±3.8, p-0.000), ferritin (404.8±41.6 vs. 258.8±40.2, p-0.012), IL6 (65.5±11.6 vs. 26.9±4.4, p-0.002), LDH (321.8±10.1 vs. 286.8±8.4, p-0.008) were significantly higher in the diabetes group. Procalcitonin and D Dimer did not differ significantly. In conclusion, we report the highest prevalence of diabetes in a hospitalized COVID-19 population so far. The diabetes group had more severe disease and greater mortality. Baseline HbA1c correlated with poor outcomes. The comorbidities could have contributed to these poorer outcomes in the diabetes group. Strategies to improve outcomes in this pandemic it is imperative to include screening for and better control of diabetes.

Understanding the mechanism of covalent inhibition will aid in the design of safer and more selective covalent inhibitors that target BTK. The mechanism of covalent inhibition in BTK has been uncertain because there is no appropriate residue nearby that can act as a base to deprotonate the cysteine thiol prior to covalent bond formation. We investigate several mechanisms of covalent modification of C481 in BTK by ibrutinib using combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics reaction simulations. The lowest energy pathway involves direct proton transfer from C481 to the acrylamide warhead in ibrutinib, followed by covalent bond formation to form an enol intermediate. There is a subsequent rate-limiting keto–enol tautomerisation step (ΔG(‡) = 10.5 kcal mol(−1)) to reach the inactivated BTK/ibrutinib complex. Our results represent the first mechanistic study of BTK inactivation by ibrutinib to consider multiple mechanistic pathways. These findings should aid in the design of covalent drugs that target BTK and other similar targets.","Voice, Angus T.; Tresadern, Gary; Twidale, Rebecca M.; van Vlijmen, Herman; Mulholland, Adrian J.",,72,1

Findings showed that participants believed to a great extent that engaging young children with numerical activities is important. Most reported that they had observed children engaging with at least some numerical activity. In general, participants relayed more activities and more detailed activities when suggesting activities for each competency, than they did when reporting observed activities. Findings also suggested a need to enhance adults’ knowledge regarding the necessity to promote verbal counting, separate from object counting, as well as to increase adults’ awareness of number composition and decomposition.

A comparative study examined referral workload at a regional Plastic Surgery Unit, Major Trauma Centre & Burns Facility during the initial stages of the lockdown period. Lessons learnt can then help prepare for the future. METHOD: From initial lockdown (24/03/2020), all Plastic Surgery referrals were documented for 28 days. This data was compared to the same period in 2019. Demographics, diagnosis, mechanism of injury and time to presentation and surgery were noted. RESULTS: A total of 525 patients were managed, with a 48% reduction in referrals during lockdown. Hand trauma referrals reduced by 16% but increases in deliberate self-harm (100%), DIY injury (75%), lower limb trauma (250%) and burns (64%) were seen. Fewer work and school related injuries were managed in keeping with lockdown rules. Notably, access to surgical management did not alter. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the workload of our service. Social behaviours and psychological impact were common contributing factors. As Plastic Surgeons this should be acknowledged and consideration of optimising mental health services and health education should be prioritised for the future.","Gohil, K; Al-Himdani, S; Walkden, A; Price, G",Br J Surg,72,24

Malignant tumors characterized by increased proliferation also require new vasculature to provide an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients for developing tumor. Gliomas are among the most frequent primary tumors of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by increased new vessel formation. The processes of neoangiogenesis, necessary for glioma development, are mediated by numerous growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and other proteins. In contrast to other solid tumors, some biological conditions, such as the blood–brain barrier and the unique interplay between immune microenvironment and tumor, represent significant challenges in glioma therapy. Therefore, the objective of the study was to present the role of various proangiogenic factors in glioma angiogenesis as well as the differences between normal and tumoral angiogenesis. Another goal was to present novel therapeutic options in oncology approaches. We performed a thorough search via the PubMed database. In this paper we describe various proangiogenic factors in glioma vasculature development. The presented paper also reviews various antiangiogenic factors necessary in maintaining equilibrium between pro- and antiangiogenic processes.

The conditional release of encapsulated carriers via modifications in the dynamic structure of DNA in response to tumor microenvironment has led to the specific delivery of active agents to the tumors. Therefore, specific drug delivery enhances the therapeutic efficacy and decreases the side effects on the neighboring healthy cells. Despite the great potential for pharmacological applications of the DNA-assisted and pH-sensitive smart nano-carriers, some challenges should be addressed before clinical transition. Since the therapeutic efficacies of DNA based smart nano-carriers have only been investigated in a proof-of-concept manner, the detailed in vivo parameters of the nano-carriers must be investigated and elucidated, including colloidal stability, circulating half-life, immunogenicity, dose-dependent cytotoxicity, pharmacokinetics, and clearance mechanisms. ABSTRACT: The rapid development of multidrug co-delivery and nano-medicines has made spontaneous progress in tumor treatment and diagnosis. DNA is a unique biological molecule that can be tailored and molded into various nanostructures. The addition of ligands or stimuli-responsive elements enables DNA nanostructures to mediate highly targeted drug delivery to the cancer cells. Smart DNA nanostructures, owing to their various shapes, sizes, geometry, sequences, and characteristics, have various modes of cellular internalization and final disposition. On the other hand, functionalized DNA nanocarriers have specific receptor-mediated uptake, and most of these ligand anchored nanostructures able to escape lysosomal degradation. DNA-based and stimuli responsive nano-carrier systems are the latest advancement in cancer targeting. The data exploration from various studies demonstrated that the DNA nanostructure and stimuli responsive drug delivery systems are perfect tools to overcome the problems existing in the cancer treatment including toxicity and compromised drug efficacy. In this light, the review summarized the insights about various types of DNA nanostructures and stimuli responsive nanocarrier systems applications for diagnosis and treatment of cancer.","Sabir, Fakhara; Zeeshan, Mahira; Laraib, Ushna; Barani, Mahmood; Rahdar, Abbas; Cucchiarini, Magali; Pandey, Sadanand",Cancers (Basel),72,1

Although nanotechnology has been greatly applied in the field of vaccines, it is seldom used for conjugate vaccine research because it is very difficult to connect polysaccharides and nanocarriers. In this work, an orthogonal and modular biosynthesis method was used to produce nanoconjugate vaccines using the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system. When SpyTag/SpyCatcher system is combined with protein glycosylation technology, bacterial O-polysaccharide obtained from Shigela flexneri 2a can be conjugated onto the surfaces of different virus-like particles (VLPs) in a biocompatible and controlled manner. After confirming the excellent lymph node targeting and humoral immune activation abilities, these nanoconjugate vaccines further induced efficient prophylactic effects against infection in a mouse model. These results demonstrated that natural polysaccharide antigens can be easily connected to VLPs to prepare highly efficient nanoconjugate vaccines. To the best of the researchers’ knowledge, this is the first time VLP-based nanoconjugate vaccines are produced efficiently, and this strategy could be applied to develop various pathogenic nanoconjugate vaccines.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Blastocysts were securely stored, effectively warmed and safely transferred to yield normal pregnancy outcomes under uncertain laboratory conditions subject to unprecedented policy changes. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: By April 2020, every IVF lab worldwide was implementing deep cleaning/disinfecting procedures in their laboratory and patient-contact areas, thorough hand-washing policies and mandatory PPE to reduce the chance of contact transmission and spread of the potentially deadly SARS-CoV–2 coronavirus. Furthermore, we know that safeguards like oil overlay culture dishes and pipetting dilution factors provide insurance against possible contamination. However, knowing that the trophectoderm of blastocysts possessed the ACE–2 binding receptor, potential concern existed regarding the continuation of laser zona opening and biopsy procedures that could possibly expose cryopreserved embryos to the coronavirus in liquid nitrogen storage (vapor or liquid). STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Between March 8 and December 22, 2020, 508 patients performed FET cycles involving the use of single (n = 490) or dual (n = 18) euploid microSecure vitrified blastocysts. In this retrospective analysis, we compared clinical pregnancy outcomes to a 5 year dataset (2015–2019) encompassing 2768 single and 272 dual embryo transfer FET cycles. All blastocysts were vitrified using a closed microSecure system and Innovative Cryoenterprise (ICE; NJ, USA) non-DMSO, glycerol-EG solutions. Differences were assessed by Chi-square analysis (p < 0.05). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Deep cleaning was performed with Simple Green Pro3+ Virucide in non-lab areas (e.g., ET rooms, waiting room) and 6% H2O2 & OoSafe solutions to disinfect lab surfaces and equipment. Group embryo cultures were performed in MCO–5M humidified incubators under low oxygen tri-gas conditions with varying CO2 levels (5.3–6.0%; pH = 7.3–7.35) using 25µl droplets of LifeGlobal medium+7.5%LGPS+1%sodium hyaluronate, before changing to 10µl droplet/GPS dishes post-biopsy. FET cycles involved 4-step sucrose dilutions and transvaginal ultrasound-guided embryo transfers. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: While ICSI fertilization rates were unchanged in 2020 (79.4% 2PN vs 77.3%), blastocyst utilization rates tended to be slightly lower than past years (56.4% vs 59.9%) but within an acceptable range. Of 529 blastocysts warmed, 527 (99.7%) survived completely for transfer, being comparable to the 99.4% experienced over 5 years. Furthermore, there was no differences detected in single embryo transfer pregnancy outcomes. The implantation and ongoing clinical pregnancy/live birth rates were 69% and 66.53% compared to 70.4% and 65.1%, respectively. Under pandemic conditions we did not observe an increase in biochemical pregnancies (10.3%) nor spontaneous miscarriage rates (7.8%). Although it is possible that our rigorous disinfection practices could have attributed to lower blastocyst production, the viability of those embryos was not compromised. Importantly, we were able to feel comfortable performing micromanipulation and cryopreservation procedures throughout the year knowing that we were effectively eliminating possible vertical transmission of coronavirus to an exposed trophectoderm layer in cryostorage by applying mircoSecure vitrification. Post-FET clinical check-ups revealed no patient reporting any fever or other Covid–19 symptoms in the weeks following their transfers. We are fortunate to say that our Lab staff, physicians and patients have remained healthy throughout 2020. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Blastocyst survival and viability are independent of possible viral exposure. Previously, the risk of disease transmission via liquid nitrogen or vapor exposure was considered highly unlikely (Pomeroy et al., 2010), but that was at a time when embryos were primarily zona-enclosed. Today’s ART standards have us re-evaluating safer approaches. Wider implications of the findings: We have effectively mitigated avoiding performing zona opening procedures by employing our standard practice of aseptic, closed vitrification. In combination with standard preventative measures (PPE, hand hygiene, distance awareness) and routine deep cleaning practices, we sustained a contamination-free environment and healthy patients, capable of sustaining high levels of pregnancy success.

Despite the high incidence of hernias in Africa and Asia, the implantation of costly mesh netting is not financially feasible. Because of that various investigative groups have examined the use of sterilized mosquito netting. The animal experiments as well as the clinical trials have both shown equivalent short- and long-term results. The goal of this paper is the comparison of biocompatibility of human fibroblasts on the established commercially available nets and on sterilized polyester mosquito mesh over a period of 12 weeks. MATERIALS AND METHODS Three commercially available plastic mesh types and a gas-sterilized mosquito polyethylenterephtalate (polyester) mesh were examined. Human fibroblasts from subcutaneous healthy tissue were used. Various tests for evaluating the growth behavior and the cell morphology of human fibroblasts were conducted. The semi-quantitative (light microscopy) and qualitative (scanning electron microscopy) analyses were performed after 1 week and then again after 12 weeks. The cell proliferation and cytotoxicity of the implants were investigated with the help of the 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-cell proliferation test and the LDH-cytotoxicity test. The number of live cells per ml was determined with the Bürker counting chamber. In addition, analyses were made of the cell metabolism (oxidative stress) by measuring the pH value, hydrogen peroxide, and glycolysis. RESULTS After 12 weeks, a proliferation of fibroblasts on all mesh is documented. No mesh showed a complete apoptosis of the cells. This qualitative observation could be confirmed quantitatively in a biochemical assay by marking the proliferating cells with BrdU. The biochemical analysis brought the proof that the materials used, including the polyester of the mosquito mesh, are not cytotoxic for the fibroblasts. The vitality of the cells was between 94 and 98%. The glucose metabolism as well as the pH value of the fibroblasts showed no significant differences between the tested meshes. The examination of the oxidative stress via measurement of the H2O2 concentration showed values in the normal range for the commercially alloplastic meshes and the mosquito mesh. CONCLUSIONS Our examination showed no significant difference with regard to biocompatibility between the officially approved and cost-intensive meshes and the sterilized (autoclaved) mosquito mesh. Due to the proven strength and stability of the mosquito mesh and their proven compatibility, the implantation of the sterilized mosquito mesh in additional in vivo studies must be considered. A wide-scale and cost-effective treatment of hernias could thus be guaranteed, not only in Third World countries.","Wiessner, R; Kleber, T; Ekwelle, N; Ludwig, K; Richter, D-U",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,72,19

While the functional significance of many ISGs has yet to be determined, their cell type and temporal nature of expression suggest unique activities against specific pathogens. Using a combination of ectopic expression and gene silencing approaches in cell culture, we previously identified Ifi27l2a as a candidate antiviral ISG within neuronal subsets of the central nervous system (CNS) that restricts infection by West Nile virus (WNV), an encephalitic flavivirus of global concern. To investigate the physiological relevance of Ifi27l2a in the context of viral infection, we generated Ifi27l2a(-/-) mice. Although adult mice lacking Ifi27l2a were more vulnerable to lethal WNV infection, the viral burden was greater only within the CNS, particularly in the brain stem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Within neurons of the cerebellum and brain stem, in the context of WNV infection, a deficiency of Ifi27l2a was associated with less cell death, which likely contributed to sustained viral replication and higher titers in these regions. Infection studies in a primary cell culture revealed that Ifi27l2a(-/-) cerebellar granule cell neurons and macrophages but not cerebral cortical neurons, embryonic fibroblasts, or dendritic cells sustained higher levels of WNV infection than wild-type cells and that this difference was greater under conditions of beta interferon (IFN-β) pretreatment. Collectively, these findings suggest that Ifi27l2a has an antiviral phenotype in subsets of cells and that at least some ISGs have specific inhibitory functions in restricted tissues. IMPORTANCE The interferon-stimulated Ifi27l2a gene is expressed differentially within the central nervous system upon interferon stimulation or viral infection. Prior studies in cell culture suggested an antiviral role for Ifi27l2a during infection by West Nile virus (WNV). To characterize its antiviral activity in vivo, we generated mice with a targeted gene deletion of Ifi27l2a. Based on extensive virological analyses, we determined that Ifi27l2a protects mice from WNV-induced mortality by contributing to the control of infection of the hindbrain and spinal cord, possibly by regulating cell death of neurons. This antiviral activity was validated in granule cell neurons derived from the cerebellum and in macrophages but was not observed in other cell types. Collectively, these data suggest that Ifi27l2a contributes to innate immune restriction of WNV in a cell-type- and tissue-specific manner.","Lucas, Tiffany M; Richner, Justin M; Diamond, Michael S",Journal of virology,72,1

To date, carfilzomib-associated TMA has predominantly been described in relapsed/refractory myeloma patients. We report eight patients with newly diagnosed myeloma who experienced TMA events while receiving carfilzomib on the phase II CARDAMON trial. The first three occurred during maintenance single-agent carfilzomib, two occurred at induction with carfilzomib given with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (KCd) and three occurred during KCd consolidation. At TMA presentation 6/8 were hypertensive; 7/8 had acute kidney injury and in three, renal impairment persisted after resolution of TMA in other respects. The mechanism of carfilzomib-associated TMA remains unclear, though patients with known hypertension seem particularly susceptible. Given the first three cases occurred during maintenance after a longer than five-week treatment break, a protocol amendment was instituted with: aggressive hypertension management, carfilzomib step-up dosing (20 mg/m2 on day 1) at start of maintenance before dose escalation to 56 mg/m2 maximum, and adding 10 mg dexamethasone as premedication to maintenance carfilzomib infusions. No further TMA events occurred during maintenance following this amendment and the TMA incidence reduced from 4·2 to 1·6 per 1 000 patient cycles.","Camilleri, Marquita; Cuadrado, Maria; Phillips, Elizabeth; Wilson, William; Jenner, Richard; Pang, Gavin; Kamora, Sumaiya; Streetly, Matthew; Popat, Rakesh; Bygrave, Ceri; Owen, Roger; Cavenagh, James; Chapman, Mike; Sive, Jonathan; Eccersley, Lydia; Sheaff, Michael; Benjamin, Reuben; Ramasamy, Karthik; Cook, Gordon; Virchis, Andres; Chavda, Selina J; Clifton-Hadley, Laura; Scully, Marie Anne; Yong, Kwee",British journal of haematology,72,1

Objective To investigate the combination of everolimus plus endocrine therapy in first-line and second-line treatment settings for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants In the multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase 2 BOLERO-4 (Breast Cancer Trials of Oral Everolimus) clinical trial, 245 patients were screened for eligibility; 202 were enrolled between March 7, 2013, and December 17, 2014. A median follow-up of 29.5 months had been achieved by the data cutoff date (December 17, 2016). Interventions Patients received first-line treatment with everolimus, 10 mg/d, plus letrozole, 2.5 mg/d. Second-line treatment with everolimus, 10 mg/d, plus exemestane, 25 mg/d, was offered at the investigator's discretion upon initial disease progression. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the first-line setting per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.0. Safety was assessed in patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication and at least 1 postbaseline safety assessment. Results A total of 202 women treated in the first-line setting had a median age of 64.0 years (interquartile range, 58.0-70.0 years) with metastatic (194 [96.0%]) or locally advanced (8 [4.0%]) breast cancer. Median progression-free survival was 22.0 months (95% CI, 18.1-25.1 months) with everolimus and letrozole. Median overall survival was not reached; 24-month estimated overall survival rate was 78.7% (95% CI, 72.1%-83.9%). Fifty patients started second-line treatment; median progression-free survival was 3.7 months (95% CI, 1.9-7.4 months). No new safety signals were observed. In the first-line setting, the most common all-grade adverse event was stomatitis (139 [68.8%]); the most common grade 3 to 4 adverse event was anemia (21 [10.4%]). In the second-line setting, the most common adverse events were stomatitis and decreased weight (10 [20.0%] each); the most common grade 3 to 4 adverse event was hypertension (5 [10.0%]). There were 50 (24.8%) deaths overall during the study; 40 were due to study indication (breast cancer). Conclusions and Relevance The results of this trial add to the existing body of evidence suggesting that everolimus plus endocrine therapy is a good first-line treatment option for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer.

However, the impact on patients is unknown. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the psychological and economic impact of the cancellation of scheduled spinal operations. METHODS We identified 50 patients with cancelled surgeries between 16 March 2020 and 24 April 2020. Forty-nine (98%) participants were contacted, with whom the modified WES-Pi questionnaire was filled in during a telephone interview. RESULTS Of the 49 respondents, 28 (57.2%) were aged <65 years. The most often reported problem (85.7%) was an ongoing limitation in basic daily activities. At least moderate sadness was experienced by 65.3% and disappointment by 73.5% of the patients. More than 80% reported concerns about the continuation and 73.5% about the progression of their symptoms. Out of 27 employees (55.1%), 63% could not work due to severe pain or movement limitation (p < .001). The inability to work was associated with anger (p = .037). The work-related impact of the cancellation was associated with stress (p < .0001) and concerns about continuing the symptoms (p = .004). Two-third of patients would undergo immediate surgery despite the current epidemic situation. CONCLUSIONS The cancellations of elective spinal surgeries have a serious psychological impact on patients. This together with potential economic consequences is especially evident in employees unable to work due to pain or movement disability. The information is beneficial for health management. Every effort should be made to resume planned surgical treatment if the epidemiological situation allows it.","Kaiser, Radek; Svoboda, Norbert; Waldauf, Petr; Netuka, David",British journal of neurosurgery,72,29

We compared self-reported HRQoL and hospital quality of care (QoC) among perinatal women with and without COVID-19 infection. METHODS This is a prospective cohort study of perinatal women attending a tertiary maternity unit during the pandemic. 18 women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 20 SARS-CoV-2-negative women were recruited. Participants completed the Short Form (SF-12), Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) and Quality from the Patient's Perspective (QPP) questionnaires. Mean scores were compared. RESULTS 95% of the Non-COVID cohort were Caucasian, while 67% of the COVID-19 cohort were not Caucasian (x2 =16.01, p<0.0001). The mean SF-12 for physical health in the COVID cohort had significantly lower scores (p<0.0002). There was no difference in mental health and wellbeing between cohorts. The QoC experienced was notably similar and very positive. CONCLUSION There was a significantly greater burden on physical health among pregnant women with COVID-19 infection. Mental health and psychological status were similar in both groups. High quality of care during a pandemic is possible to deliver in a maternity setting, irrespective of COVID status.","Alaya, Fátimah; Worrall, Amy P; O'toole, Fiona; Doyle, Jillian; Duffy, Richard M; Geary, Michael P",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,72,1

Endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) can be isolated from adult peripheral blood. A 3D co-culture system may rescue in vitro ASC senescence. METHODS A 3D co-culture model was successfully established using hyaluronic acid (HA) gel and a 10:1 ratio of late-passage ASCs and ECFCs. Cell density and culture conditions were optimized. Stem cell phenotype was characterized by flow cytometry. ELISA was used to measure the trophic effect of angiogenic growth factors and compare the effects of these factors between the 3-D co-culture and single-cell culture. Therapeutic potential of ASC/ECFC 3-D co-cultures was evaluated in a mouse chronic injury model. RESULTS Following incubation in a HA substrate 3D co-culture system, ASC morphology, phenotype, secretory profile, and differentiation capacity were restored. The ASC/ECFC co-culture increased the secretion of cytokines, such as hepatocyte growth factor, compared with single-cell 3D culture or monolayer culture. Mice radiation-ulcer wounds treated with ASC/ECFC 3-D co-cultures (spheroids) showed epithelialization and improved healing compared with wounds treated with ASCs or ECFCs alone. Further, transplanted ASC/ECFC spheroids exhibited superior angiogenic potential due to the ability of the ASCs to transdifferentiate into pericytes. CONCLUSION 3D co-culture of ECFCs and ASCs in vitro restored native ASC properties by reversing cellular senescence and loss of trophic function. Transplant of ASC/ECFC 3D spheroids in vivo demonstrated pro-angiogenic capacity with improved therapeutic potential.","Hu, Wansheng; Zhu, Shengqian; Fanai, Mimi Lalrimawii; Wang, Jing; Cai, Junrong; Feng, Jingwei",Stem cell research & therapy,72,29

The goal of this review was to correlate duplex findings and QoL assessments in clinical studies with long-term follow-up. METHODS A review of the English language literature on PUBMED revealed 17 clinical studies, including 9 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 6 prospective, and 2 retrospective studies that included patients with at least 5-year follow-up after endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS), and traditional superficial venous surgery. RESULTS At 5 years, great saphenous vein (GSV) occlusion rate on duplex ultrasound ranged from 66% to 82% for EVLA, from 62% to 92% for RFA, from 41% to 58% for UGFS and from 54% to 85% for surgery. Freedom from GSV reflux rates were 82% and 84%, respectively for EVLA and surgery, and ranged between 84% and 95% for RFA. Significant improvements were observed in several domains of generic QoL and in most domains of venous disease-specific QoL, irrespective of the treatment. In at least one RCT, CIVIQ scores correlated well with abnormal duplex findings in patients who underwent treatment with UGFS. In another RCT, long-term AVVQ was significantly better after surgery as compared with UGFS similar to results of duplex findings. CONCLUSIONS Analysis of the available literature confirmed that all four techniques were effective in the abolishment of reflux or obliteration of the GSV. Moreover, well-designed RCTs with large sample size are needed to produce robust long-term data on clinical outcome after treatment of varicose veins and CVI and to better understand the relationships between duplex-derived data and QoL assessments.","Huang, Ying; Gloviczki, Peter",Phlebology,72,28

Since its first appearance in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China, SARS-CoV-2 infection has quickly spread across the globe, with the first case reported on the African continent, in Egypt on February 14 th, 2020. Although the global number of COVID-19 infections has increased exponentially since the beginning of the pandemic, the number of new infections and deaths recorded in African countries have been relatively modest, suggesting slower transmission dynamics of the virus on the continent, a lower case fatality rate, or simply a lack of testing or reliable data. Notably, there is no significant increase in unexplained pneumonias or deaths on the continent which could possibly indicate the effectiveness of interventions introduced by several African governments.

Current vaccination approaches against this emerging coronavirus are only partially effective, though natural infection protects pigs against reinfection and provides lactogenic immunity to suckling piglets. The viral spike (S) glycoprotein, responsible for receptor binding and cell entry, is the major target for neutralizing antibodies. However, knowledge of antibody epitopes, their nature and location in the spike structure, and the mechanisms by which the antibodies interfere with infection is scarce. Here we describe the generation and characterization of 10 neutralizing and nonneutralizing mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against the S1 receptor binding subunit of the S protein. By expression of different S1 protein fragments, six antibody epitope classes distributed over the five structural domains of the S1 subunit were identified. Characterization of antibodies for cross-reactivity and cross-neutralization revealed antigenic differences among PEDV strains. The epitopes of potent neutralizing antibodies segregated into two epitope classes and mapped within the N-terminal sialic acid binding domain and in the more C-terminal receptor binding domain. Antibody neutralization escape mutants displayed single amino acid substitutions that impaired antibody binding and neutralization and defined the locations of the epitopes. Our observations picture the antibody epitope landscape of the PEDV S1 subunit and reveal that its cell attachment domains are key targets of neutralizing antibodies.IMPORTANCE Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an emerging porcine coronavirus, causes an economically important enteric disease in pigs. Effective PEDV vaccines for disease control are currently lacking. The spike (S) glycoprotein on the virion surface is the key player in virus cell entry and, therefore, the main target of neutralizing antibodies. To understand the antigenic landscape of the PEDV spike protein, we developed monoclonal antibodies against the spike protein's S1 receptor binding region and characterized their epitopes, neutralizing activity, and cross-reactivity toward multiple PEDV strains. Epitopes of antibodies segregated into six epitope classes dispersed over the multidomain S1 structure. Monoclonal antibodies revealed antigenic variability in B-cell epitopes between PEDV strains. The epitopes of neutralizing antibodies mapped to two distinct domains in S1 that are involved in binding to carbohydrate and proteinaceous cell surface molecules, respectively, indicating the importance of these cell attachment sites on the PEDV spike protein in eliciting a protective humoral immune response.","Li, Chunhua; Li, Wentao; Lucio de Esesarte, Eduardo; Guo, Hongbo; van den Elzen, Paul; Aarts, Eduard; van den Born, Erwin; Rottier, Peter J M; Bosch, Berend-Jan",Journal of virology,72,17

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to audit outcomes of ileorectal anastomosis for Crohn's and factors associated with proctectomy and reoperation. DESIGN This retrospective study involved a chart review and contacting patients. SETTINGS Patients with Crohn's colitis who had an ileorectal anastomosis were identified from the Mount Sinai Hospital Inflammatory Bowel Disease Database. PATIENTS Demographics, operative and perioperative outcomes, and reoperative data were collected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Five- and 10-year Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for survival from proctectomy and Crohn's-related revisional surgery. Cox proportional hazards models were used to model the hazards of proctectomy and Crohn's-related revision on the clinical characteristics of patients. RESULTS Eighty-one patients had an ileorectal anastomosis for Crohn's disease from 1982 to 2010. The most common indications for surgery were failed medical management (60/81, 74.1%) and a stricture causing obstruction (14/81, 17.3%). Seventy-seven percent (n = 62) had a 1-stage procedure, whereas 23% (n = 19) had a 2-stage procedure (colectomy followed by ileorectal anastomosis). The overall anastomotic leak rate was 7.4% (n = 6). Fifty-six patients had a functioning ileorectal anastomosis at the time of follow-up. At 5 and 10 years, 87% (95% CI: 75.5-93.3) and 72.2% (95% CI: 55.8-83.4) of individuals had a functioning ileorectal anastomosis. Eighteen patients required proctectomy for poor symptom control, whereas 11 patients required a small-bowel resection plus redo-ileorectal anastomosis. The mean time to proctectomy from the original ileorectal anastomosis was 88.3 months (SD = 62.1). Smoking was associated with both proctectomy (HR 3.93 (95% CI: 1.46-10.55)) and reoperative surgery (HR 2.12 (95% CI: 0.96-4.72)). LIMITATIONS : This study was retrospective. CONCLUSIONS Ileorectal anastomosis is an appropriate operation for selected patients with Crohn's colitis with sparing of the rectum. However, patients must be counseled that the reoperation rate and/or proctectomy rate is approximately 30%.","O'Riordan, J M; O'Connor, B I; Huang, H; Victor, J C; Gryfe, R; MacRae, H M; Cohen, Z; McLeod, R S",Diseases of the colon and rectum,72,1

In recent years, there has been an increasing tendency to apply self-gripping meshes (s.g). In many cases, additional suture of the mesh is carried out; however, it is uncertain what the benefits or potential risks of this actually are. METHODS The evaluation was undertaken on the basis of the Herniamed register, and covered all unilateral Lichtenstein operations between 01.09.2009 up to 30.09.2013. The analysis only included patients with whom s.g. meshes with resorbable micro hooks had been used (Progrip(®), Covidien) and who had undergone a full 1-year follow-up examination (80.15 %). RESULTS In total, 2095 patients were suitable for analysis, of which 816 (38.95 %) cases received an additional suture fixation (Fix). With increasing hernia size, more frequent fixation took place (29.97 % of hernias <1.5 cm vs. 46.65 % of hernias >3 cm, p < 0.001). The recurrence rates 1 year after surgery did not show any significant differences (Fix. 0.86 % vs. No Fix. 1.17 %; p = 0.661) with and without fixation, even when being adjusted for covariables. Likewise, no differences were noted in terms of postoperative complications (Fix. 5.15 % vs. No Fix. 5.08 %; p = 1.0). In addition, the numbers of patients needing to be treated after 1 year for chronic pain were also comparable (Fix. 2.33 % vs. No Fix. 2.97 %; p = 0.411). CONCLUSION Within the group that did not have additional suture fixation of self-gripping meshes (No Fix.), the length of operations was on average 8 min shorter (p < 0.001). No differences could be observed in terms of postoperative complications, treatment requiring chronic pain and recurrence rates.","Köhler, Gernot; Lechner, Michael; Mayer, Franz; Köckerling, Ferdinand; Schrittwieser, Rudolf; Fortelny, René H; Adolf, Daniela; Emmanuel, Klaus",World journal of surgery,72,19

Pyrethroid is a synthetic product of pyrethrin, which in turn is the active ingredient of pyrethrum, a flower extract. RECENT FINDINGS On the contrary, a large gap of knowledge exists in the association of interstitial lung disease (ILD) with pyrethroids. So far, two cases of ILD, one associated with pyrethrin and one associated with pyrethrum, were described. Existing literature on both other (pulmo)toxic effects of pyrethroids in human and animals is summarized. SUMMARY We present three cases of severe pulmonary toxicity after inhalation of pyrethroid-based insecticides demanding hospitalization and oxygen therapy. One of these cases died. Although a causal relationship was hard to establish, these cases all demonstrated an obvious history of (repeated) pyrethroid exposure associated with ILD. Moreover, other causes of ILD as well as infections were excluded. Furthermore, studies in mammals as well as aquatic animals confirm (pulmonary) toxicity of pyrethroids. The occurrence of toxicity is dose-dependent but also associated with individual susceptibility. Therefore, we would like to acknowledge that awareness of potential hazards of commercially available insecticides containing pyrethroids to both medical physicians and the public is mandatory.","Vorselaars, Adriane D M; van den Berg, Paulus M; Drent, Marjolein",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,72,27

We performed a network meta-analysis to compare the effects of various antiplatelet regimens on saphenous vein graft patency, mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events and bleeding among CABG patients. METHODS We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval Systems Online, Excerpta Medica Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, American College of Physicians Journal Club and conference proceedings for randomized controlled trials. Screening, data extraction, risk of bias assessment and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation were performed in duplicate. We conducted a random effect Bayesian network meta-analysis including both direct and indirect comparisons. RESULTS We included 43 randomized controlled trials studying 15 511 patients. DAPT with low-dose ASA and ticagrelor [odds ratio (OR) 2.53, 95% credible interval (CrI) 1.35-4.72; I2 = 55; low certainty] or clopidogrel (OR 1.56, 95% CrI 1.02-2.39; I2 = 55; very low certainty) improved saphenous vein graft patency when compared to low-dose ASA monotherapy. DAPT with low-dose ASA and ticagrelor was associated with lower mortality (OR 0.52, 95% CrI 0.30-0.87; I2 = 14; high certainty) and lower major adverse cardiovascular events (OR 0.63, 95% CrI 0.44-0.91; I2 = 0; high certainty) when compared to low-dose ASA monotherapy. Based on moderate certainty evidence, DAPT was associated with an increase in major bleeding. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that DAPT improves saphenous vein graft patency, mortality and major adverse cardiovascular event. As such, surgeons and physicians should consider re-initiating DAPT for acute coronary syndrome patients after their CABG, at the expense of an increased risk for major bleeding.

Research on the COVID-19 pandemic benefiting from open-access data and machine learning algorithms is still scarce yet can produce relevant and pragmatic information. With country-level pre-COVID-19-pandemic variables, we aimed to cluster countries in groups with shared profiles of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Unsupervised machine learning algorithms (k-means) were used to define data-driven clusters of countries; the algorithm was informed by disease prevalence estimates, metrics of air pollution, socio-economic status and health system coverage. Using the one-way ANOVA test, we compared the clusters in terms of number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, number of deaths, case fatality rate and order in which the country reported the first case. Results: The model to define the clusters was developed with 155 countries. The model with three principal component analysis parameters and five or six clusters showed the best ability to group countries in relevant sets. There was strong evidence that the model with five or six clusters could stratify countries according to the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (p<0.001). However, the model could not stratify countries in terms of number of deaths or case fatality rate. Conclusions: A simple data-driven approach using available global information before the COVID-19 pandemic, seemed able to classify countries in terms of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. The model was not able to stratify countries based on COVID-19 mortality data.","Carrillo-Larco, Rodrigo M; Castillo-Cara, Manuel",Wellcome open research,72,24

The complex interplay between heat-based cancer treatments such as thermal ablation and chemotherapy may require computational models to identify the relationship between heat exposure and pharmacokinetics in order to optimise drug delivery. MATERIALS AND METHODS Spatio-temporal data on tissue temperature and perfusion from heat-transfer models of radiofrequency ablation were used as input data. A spatio-temporal multi-compartmental pharmacokinetic model was built to describe the release of doxorubicin (DOX) from LTSL into the tumour plasma space, and subsequent transport into the extracellular space, and the cells. Systemic plasma and tissue compartments were also included. We compared standard chemotherapy (free-DOX) to LTSL-DOX administered as bolus at a dose of 0.7 mg/kg body weight. RESULTS Modelling LTSL-DOX treatment resulted in tumour tissue drug concentration of approximately 9.3 microg/g with highest values within 1 cm outside the ablation zone boundary. Free-DOX treatment produced comparably uniform tissue drug concentrations of approximately 3.0 microg/g. Administration of free-DOX resulted in a considerably higher peak level of drug concentration in the systemic plasma compartment (16.1 microg/g) compared to LTSL-DOX (4.4 microg/g). These results correlate well with a prior in vivo study. CONCLUSIONS Combination of LTSL-DOX with thermal ablation allows localised drug delivery with higher tumour tissue concentrations than conventional chemotherapy. Our model may facilitate drug delivery optimisation via investigation of the interplays among liposome properties, tumour perfusion, and heating regimen.","Gasselhuber, Astrid; Dreher, Matthew R; Negussie, Ayele; Wood, Bradford J; Rattay, Frank; Haemmerich, Dieter","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",72,1

RECENT FINDINGS Different ways to define gastrointestinal failure have been used in the past. Recently, the term 'acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI)' has been proposed to specifically describe gastrointestinal dysfunction as a part of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms and different aspects in assessment of gastrointestinal function in adult ICU patients are presented. Currently, there is no single marker that could reliably describe gastrointestinal dysfunction. Therefore, monitoring and management is still based on complex assessment of different gastrointestinal symptoms and feeding intolerance, even though this approach includes a large amount of subjectivity. The possible role of biomarkers (citrulline, enterohormones, etc.) and additional parameters like intra-abdominal pressure remains to be clarified. SUMMARY Defining gastrointestinal failure remains challenging but broad consensus needs to be reached and disseminated soon to allow conduct of interventional studies.

In this study, fragment peptides of neurotensin and xenin, acetyl-neurotensin (8-13) and xenin-8-Gln, were fused together to create Ac-NT/XN-8-Gln. Following assessment of enzymatic stability, effects of Ac-NT/XN-8-Gln on in vitro beta-cell function were studied. Sub-chronic antidiabetic efficacy of Ac-NT/XN-8-Gln alone, and in combination with the clinically approved GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4, was assessed in high fat fed (HFF) mice. Ac-NT/XN-8-Gln was highly resistant to plasma enzyme degradation and induced dose-dependent insulin-releasing actions (p<0.05 to p<0.01) in BRIN-BD11 beta-cells and isolated mouse islets. Ac-NT/XN-8-Gln augmented (p<0.001) the insulinotropic actions of GIP, while possessing independent beta-cell proliferative (p<0.001) and anti-apoptotic (p<0.01) actions. Twice daily treatment of HFF mice with Ac-NT/XN-8-Gln for 32 days improved glycaemic control and circulating insulin, with benefits significantly enhanced by combined exendin-4 treatment. This was reflected by reduced body fat mass (p<0.001), improved circulating lipid profile (p<0.01) and reduced HbA1c concentrations (p<0.01) in the combined treatment group. Following an oral glucose challenge, glucose levels were markedly decreased (p<0.05) only in combination treatment group and superior to exendin-4 alone, with similar observations made in response to glucose plus GIP injection. The combined treatment group also presented with improved insulin sensitivity, decreased pancreatic insulin content as well as increased islet and beta-cell areas. These data reveal that Ac-NT/XN-8-Gln is a biologically active neurotensin/xenin fusion peptide that displays prominent antidiabetic efficacy when administered together with exendin-4.","Perry, Rachele; Craig, Sarah L; Gault, Victor A; Flatt, Peter; Irwin, Nigel",Bioscience reports,72,6

OBJECTIVE To assess the impact of the treatment of carotid siphon aneurysms with FDS on the posterior communicating artery (PComA) flow. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between February 2011 and January 2015, 125 carotid siphon aneurysms were treated with FDS. We retrospectively analyzed all cases with PComA ostial coverage. The circle of Willis anatomy was also studied as the flow changes in PComA postoperatively and during angiographic follow-up. Data from neurological examination were also collected. RESULTS Eighteen aneurysms of the carotid siphon in 17 patients were treated with FDS covering the ostium of the PComA. Based on the initial angiography, patients were divided into two groups: the first with a P1/PComA size ratio >1 (10 cases) and the second with a ratio ≤1 (8 cases). Follow-up angiography (mean time of 10 months) showed 90% of PComA flow changes in group 1 but only 12.5% in group 2. There was a significant difference between the two groups (p=0.002). Nevertheless, no patient had new symptoms related to these flow changes during the follow-up period.

Psychologically, this process of alteration can lead to feelings of fear, insecurity, and anxiety. This fear and anxiety can be caused by a variety of factors. However, due to the lack of extensive studies at this time, there are little data on these conditions related to COVID-19. Therefore, in this narrative review, we have tried to identify the most important possible causes of anxiety and fear due to this disease, based on logical shreds of evidence. Then we tried to discuss the consequences and ways to manage and prevent them. Methods The current focus was on three major axes of corona-phobia, fear and anxiety. PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Google Scholar and authoritative news and information sources were considered as the data sources. Results Findings from the analysis of the results revealed that, in addition to the real and the logical reasons which belong to the intrinsic properties of SARS-CoV-2, some misleadings and misconceptions induced by media, governmental policies, public awareness level, and non-scientific speculations and contradictory data expressed by experts, researchers and scientific societies, could provide the way for the development of corona-phobia, and fear. Conclusions Each of these causal components, in its place, leads to some degrees of psychological disorders and subsequent consequences and complications. Finally, here we reviewed, summarized the previous research findings on how to prevent and manage this type of psychological disorder, and made comparisons.","Heiat, M; Heiat, F; Halaji, M; Ranjbar, R; Tavangar Marvasti, Z; Yaali-Jahromi, E; Azizi, M M; Morteza Hosseini, S; Badri, T",Annali di igiene : medicina preventiva e di comunita,72,1

We designed a one-step triplex reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) detection method including 3 pairs of primers that focused on the S1 gene of PEDV, a conserved gene of PSV, and the VP1 gene of SaV. The optimal concentrations of upstream and downstream primers in the triplex RT-PCR were 0.24 μM for PEDV, 0.15 μM for PSV, and 0.2 μM for SaV, and the optimal annealing temperature was 55.5°C. Triplex RT-PCR assessment of 402 piglet diarrhea samples was compared with conventional individual RT-PCR. Concordance rates in both tests for individual viruses were 100%, 97.6%, and 94.4% for PEDV, PSV, and SaV, respectively. PEDV, PSV, and SaV were detected in 57.2%, 10.4%, and 9.0% of the samples, respectively. The high sensitivity and specificity of this triplex RT-PCR-based detection method for PEDV, PSV, and SaV could allow rapid detection and analysis of mixed infections by these 3 viruses.","Jiang, Chunyan; He, Haijian; Zhang, Chaoying; Zhang, Xiaoju; Han, Jianfeng; Zhang, Hongbing; Luo, Yu; Wu, Yuan; Wang, Yanli; Ge, Bingqian; Xu, Jia","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",72,1

REPORT We decided on an open surgical approach: the HSK isthmus was sectioned with an Endo GIA 45 mm, and we performed a suprarenal aortic cross-clamping and an aortic graft reconstruction. Postoperatively, no urinary leakage was detected, and renal function showed no impairment. The patient died on the 10th postoperative day from pneumonia. CONCLUSION We believe that the sectioning of the HSK isthmus with Endo GIA is a fast and simple maneouvre.","Gabriele, Pagliariccio; Emanuele, Gatta; Grilli Cicilioni, Carlo; Sara, Schiavon; Luciano, Carbonari",Vascular and endovascular surgery,72,16

It is estimated that up to 88% of patients with emphysema have at least 1 incomplete interlobar fissure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of creating a complete fissure with stapling via minimally invasive video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) followed by bronchoscopic valve placement to induce lobar collapse in a swine model. METHODS Chest computed tomography (CT) scans were performed on 2 swine and at least 1 target incomplete fissure was identified. Both swine underwent VATS to complete the target fissure using a surgical stapler, followed by bronchoscopic placement of the Spiration endobronchial valves. A chest CT scan was performed immediately postprocedure. Follow-up bronchoscopy and CT scans were performed 2 weeks after the initial procedure prior to sacrifice. RESULTS Successful fissure completion was accomplished using VATS and confirmed at postmortem explanted lung gross examination. Flexible bronchoscopy 2 weeks following valve placement showed proper positioning of the valves. Effectiveness of combined procedures was confirmed by a chest CT scan that showed complete atelectasis of the target lobe at 2-week follow-up. There was no perioperative or postoperative morbidity or mortality. CONCLUSION Combined minimally invasive VATS fissure stapling with bronchoscopic valve placement to induce lobar atelectasis appears safe and feasible in the swine model. Future research in humans using a combined procedure is needed to confirm safety and clinical efficacy.","Majid, Adnan; Kheir, Fayez; Alape, Daniel; Chee, Alex; Parikh, Mihir; DeVore, Lauri; Agnew, Alexis; Gangadharan, Sidhu",Journal of bronchology & interventional pulmonology,72,1

BACKGROUND Transcatheter aortic valve implantation to treat degenerated biological aortic valves (valve-in-valve) is an established procedure in most catheterization laboratories, but the results are poorer than procedures done in native aortic stenosis. The Allegra device (Biosensors, Morges, Switzerland) has an excellent design to treat these patients. METHODS All patients with severely degenerated biological aortic valve treated with the Allegra device in centers from Spain until December 2020 were included (n = 29). Hemodynamic results and 30-day clinical outcomes were evaluated. The predominant hemodynamic failure was stenosis in 15, regurgitation in 11, and a combination of both in 3 cases. Time from aortic valve replacement to valve-in-valve procedure was 8.4 ± 3.9 years (range 3.3-22.1). RESULTS After the procedure, maximum and mean trans-valvular gradients were 17.4 ± 12.3 and 8.4 ± 6.1 mmHg, respectively. Device success was obtained in 28 patients (96.6%). In one patient with a degenerated 19 mm prosthetic valve, mean gradient after the procedure was 22 mmHg. No patients had a para-valvular leak grade >1. There were no deaths during the hospitalization or at 30 days and one patient suffered a stroke. CONCLUSIONS The Allegra trans-catheter aortic valve offers optimal hemodynamic results in patients with severely degenerated biological aortic valve.","Moreno, Raúl; Baz, José-Antonio; Moreu, José; Berenguer, Alberto; Gonzálvez-García, Ariana; Galeote, Guillermo; Hernández, Ubaldo; Cantón, Tomás; Jiménez-Valero, Santiago; Jurado-Román, Alfonso; Moya, Halley; Lázaro, Esther",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,72,31

Using a unique longitudinal dataset with detailed health and balance sheet information from a large sample of 10,900 Chilean households we study the relationship between debt trajectories in a three-year time window and mental health. We find that depressive symptoms are higher for those who have been persistently over-indebted, followed by those who transit from moderate to high debt levels. We also find that those who transition from over-indebtedness to moderate debt levels have no additional depressive symptoms compared to those with trajectories of moderate debt throughout (never over-indebted). This suggests that the debt-related contribution to depressive symptoms vanishes as debt levels fall. The association between debt and depressive symptoms seems to be driven by non-mortgage debt -primarily consumer credit- or late mortgage payments; secured debt (secured by collateral) per se is not associated with depressive symptoms. Policy interventions to reduce the negative association of over-indebtedness on mental health are discussed.","Hojman, Daniel A; Miranda, Álvaro; Ruiz-Tagle, Jaime",Social science & medicine,72,9

OBJECTIVE To estimate how alleviating PCP shortages might change life expectancy and mortality. DESIGN Generalized additive models, mixed-effects models, and generalized estimating equations. SETTING 3104 U.S. counties from 2010 to 2017. PARTICIPANTS Children and adults. MEASUREMENTS Age-adjusted life expectancy; all-cause mortality; and mortality due to cardiovascular disease, cancer, infectious disease, respiratory disease, and substance use or injury. RESULTS Persons living in counties with less than 1 physician per 3500 persons in 2017 had a mean life expectancy that was 310.9 days shorter than for persons living in counties above that threshold. In the low-density counties (n = 1218), increasing the density of PCPs above the 1:3500 threshold would be expected to increase mean life expectancy by 22.4 days (median, 19.4 days [95% CI, 0.9 to 45.6 days]), and all such counties would require 17 651 more physicians, or about 14.5 more physicians per shortage county. If counties with less than 1 physician per 1500 persons (n = 2636) were to reach the 1:1500 threshold, life expectancy would be expected to increase by 56.3 days (median, 55.6 days [CI, 4.2 to 105.6 days]), and all such counties would require 95 754 more physicians, or about 36.3 more physicians per shortage county. LIMITATION Some projections are based on extrapolations of the actual data. CONCLUSION In counties with fewer PCPs per population, increases in PCP density would be expected to substantially improve life expectancy.

To this end, we analyzed the capacity for viral detection and identification of a newly described high-density resequencing microarray (RMA), termed PathogenID, which was designed for multiple pathogen detection using database similarity searching. We focused on one of the largest and most diverse viral families described to date, the family Rhabdoviridae. We demonstrate that this approach has the potential to identify both known and related viruses for which precise sequence information is unavailable. In particular, we demonstrate that a strategy based on consensus sequence determination for analysis of RMA output data enabled successful detection of viruses exhibiting up to 26% nucleotide divergence with the closest sequence tiled on the array. Using clinical specimens obtained from rabid patients and animals, this method also shows a high species level concordance with standard reference assays, indicating that it is amenable for the development of diagnostic assays. Finally, 12 animal rhabdoviruses which were currently unclassified, unassigned, or assigned as tentative species within the family Rhabdoviridae were successfully detected. These new data allowed an unprecedented phylogenetic analysis of 106 rhabdoviruses and further suggest that the principles and methodology developed here may be used for the broad-spectrum surveillance and the broader-scale investigation of biodiversity in the viral world.","Dacheux, Laurent; Berthet, Nicolas; Dissard, Gabriel; Holmes, Edward C; Delmas, Olivier; Larrous, Florence; Guigon, Ghislaine; Dickinson, Philip; Faye, Ousmane; Sall, Amadou A; Old, Iain G; Kong, Katherine; Kennedy, Giulia C; Manuguerra, Jean-Claude; Cole, Stewart T; Caro, Valérie; Gessain, Antoine; Bourhy, Hervé",Journal of virology,72,19

DESIGN In vitro study. SETTING Research laboratory. PATIENTS None. INTERVENTIONS An in vitro bench model of the intubated respiratory system during pressure controlled ventilation was used to obtain the difference between peak inspiratory pressure measured at the Y-piece under dynamic flow conditions and plateau pressure measured under zero-flow conditions across a range of endotracheal tubes sizes (3.0-8.0 mm). Measurements were taken at combinations of pressure above positive end-expiratory pressure (10, 15, and 20 cm H2O), airway resistance (no, low, high), respiratory system compliance (ranging from normal to extremely severe), and inspiratory time at constant positive end-expiratory pressure (5 cm H2O). Multiple regression analysis was used to construct models predicting resistive pressure stratified by endotracheal tube size. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS On univariate regression analysis, respiratory system compliance (β -1.5; 95% CI, -1.7 to -1.4; p < 0.001), respiratory system resistance (β 1.7; 95% CI, 1.5-2.0; p < 0.001), pressure above positive end-expiratory pressure (β 1.7; 95% CI, 1.4-2.0; p < 0.001), and inspiratory time (β -0.7; 95% CI, -1.0 to -0.4; p < 0.001) were associated with resistive pressure. Multiple linear regression analysis showed the independent association between increasing respiratory system compliance, increasing airway resistance, increasing pressure above positive end-expiratory pressure, and decreasing inspiratory time and resistive pressure across all endotracheal tube sizes. Inspiratory time was the strongest variable associated with a proportional increase in resistive pressure. The contribution of airway resistance became more prominent with increasing endotracheal tube size. CONCLUSIONS Peak inspiratory pressures measured during pressure controlled ventilation overestimated plateau pressure irrespective of endotracheal tube size, especially with decreased inspiratory time or increased airway resistance.","Ilia, Stavroula; van Schelven, Patrick D; Koopman, Alette A; Blokpoel, Robert G T; de Jager, Pauline; Burgerhof, Johannes G M; Markhorst, Dick G; Kneyber, Martin C J",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,72,27

The purpose of this study was to review the efficacy and safety of PAE in the treatment of BPH with LUTS. METHODS A systematic review performed according to the PRISMA guidelines with a pre-specified search strategy for PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Embase databases protocol (PROSPERO ID: CRD42017059196). Trials studying the efficacy of prostate artery embolisation to treat LUTS with more than ten participants and follow-up longer than 6 months were included by two independent authors. Outcomes investigated were International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life (QoL), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5), prostate volume (PV), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), peak void flow (Qmax), post-void residual (PVR) and complications. To summarise mean change from baseline, a meta-analysis was done using the random-effects model. RESULTS The search returned 210 references, of which 13 studies met the inclusion criteria, representing 1,254 patients. Patients in the included studies with data available for meta-analysis had moderate to severe LUTS and a mean IPSS of 23.5. Statistically significant (p value < 0.05) improvements of all investigated outcomes were seen at 12-month follow-up. Major complications were reported in 0.3% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that PAE can reduce moderate to severe LUTS in men with BPH with a low risk of complications. KEY POINTS • Prostate artery embolisation (PAE) improved International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) by 67%. • Major complications after PAE are very rare. • Use of cone-beam CT may reduce risk of non-target embolisation.","Malling, B; Røder, M A; Brasso, K; Forman, J; Taudorf, M; Lönn, L",European radiology,72,28

Up to 4% of patients with COVID-19 required admission to an intensive care unit because they developed a critical illness (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome). Numerous patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome who had been admitted to the intensive care unit required rescue therapy like prone positioning. OBJECTIVES To describe the respiratory management of and the extensive use of prone positioning in patients with COVID-19 at the intensive care unit hub in Lombardy, Italy. METHODS A total of 89 patients (67% male; median age, 59 years [range, 23-80 years]) with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted between February 23 and March 31, 2020, were enrolled in this quality improvement project. RESULTS Endotracheal intubation was required in 86 patients (97%). Prone positioning was used as rescue therapy in 43 (48%) patients. Significantly more younger patients (age ≤ 59 years) were discharged alive (43 of 48 [90%]) than were older patients (age ≥ 60 years; 26 of 41 [63%]; P < .005). Among the 43 patients treated with prone ventilation, 15 (35% [95% CI, 21%-51%]) died in the intensive care unit, of which 10 (67%; P < .001) were older patients. CONCLUSIONS Prone positioning is one strategy available for treating acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19. During this pandemic, prone positioning can be used extensively as rescue therapy, per a specific protocol, in intensive care units.","Binda, Filippo; Marelli, Federica; Galazzi, Alessandro; Pascuzzo, Riccardo; Adamini, Ileana; Laquintana, Dario",Critical care nurse,72,19

Native connective tissue consists of highly organized, 3D networks of ECM fibers with complex, nonlinear mechanical properties. The most abundant stromal matrix component is fibrillar type I collagen, which often possesses a wavy, crimped morphology that confers strain- and load-dependent nonlinear mechanical behavior. Here, we established a new and simple method for engineering electrospun fibrous matrices composed of dextran vinyl sulfone (DexVS) with controllable crimped structure. A hydrophilic peptide was functionalized to DexVS matrices to trigger swelling of individual hydrogel fibers, resulting in crimped microstructure due to the fixed anchorage of fibers. Mechanical characterization of these matrices under tension confirmed orthogonal control over nonlinear stress-strain responses and matrix stiffness. We next examined ECM mechanosensing of individual endothelial cells (ECs), finding that fiber crimp promoted physical matrix remodeling alongside decreases in cell spreading, focal adhesion area, and nuclear localization of Yes-associated protein (YAP). These changes corresponded to an increase in migration speed along with evidence for long-range interactions between neighboring cells in crimped matrices. Interestingly, when ECs were seeded at high density in crimped matrices, capillary-like networks rapidly assembled containing tube-like cellular structures wrapped around bundles of synthetic matrix fibers due to increased physical reorganization of matrix fibers. Our work provides an additional level of mechanical and architectural tunability to synthetic fibrous matrices and implicates a critical role for mechanical nonlinearity in EC mechanosensing and network formation.","Davidson, Christopher; Jayco, Danica; Wang, William; Shikanov, Ariella; Baker, Brendon",Journal of biomechanical engineering,72,1

PBDE congeners with mono- to hexa-brominated substitutions were detected in the samples, indicating their ubiquitous distribution in the marine environment of China. The total PBDE concentration averaged 3.04 ng g⁻¹ lipid wt, a level that was relatively lower than in other regions of the world, especially North America where Penta-BDE was extensively used. Geographically, the highest concentration of PBDEs was found in Xiamen, and the PBDE levels in yellow croakers were significantly higher than those in pomfrets in most of the selected cities, a pattern which may be related to the different feeding habits of the two species. The congener profiles of PBDEs were found to be different from the commonly detected pattern in fishes from other regions of the world (i.e., BDE47>BDE99, BDE100>BDE153, BDE154). BDE47 and BDE154 were the predominant congeners in both species, accounting for more than 60% of the total PBDE concentrations. The reasons for the relatively high proportion of BDE154 may be due to the debromination of higher brominated congeners such as BDE183 and BDE209 by these two species.","Xia, Chonghuan; Lam, James C W; Wu, Xiaoguo; Sun, Liguang; Xie, Zhouqing; Lam, Paul K S",Chemosphere,72,5

METHODS Prospective, multicenter analysis of GCS. Ictal brainstem semiology was classified as (1) decerebration: bilateral symmetric tonic arm extension, (2) decortication: bilateral symmetric tonic arm flexion only, (3) hemi-decerebration: unilateral tonic arm extension with contralateral flexion and (4) absence of ictal tonic phase. Post-ictal posturing was also assessed. Respiration was monitored using thoraco-abdominal belts, video and pulse oximetry. RESULTS Two hundred ninety-five seizures (180 patients) were analyzed. Ictal decerebration was observed in 122/295 (41.4%), decortication in 47/295 (15.9%) and hemi-decerebration in 28/295 (9.5%) seizures. Tonic phase was absent in 98/295 (33.2%) seizures. Postictal posturing occurred in 18/295 (6.1%) seizures. PGES risk increased with ictal decerebration (OR 14.79, 95% CI [6.18-35.39], p < 0.001), decortication (OR 11.26, 95% CI [2.96-42.93], p < 0.001), or hemi-decerebration (OR 48.56, 95% CI [6.07-388.78], p < 0.001) Ictal decerebration was associated with longer PGES (p = 0.011). Post-ictal posturing was associated with post-convulsive central apnea (PCCA) (p = 0.004), longer hypoxemia (p < 0.001) and SpO2 recovery (p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS Ictal brainstem semiology is associated with increased PGES risk. Ictal decerebration is associated with longer PGES. Post-ictal posturing is associated with a threefold increased risk of PCCA, longer hypoxemia and SpO2 recovery. Peri-ictal brainstem posturing may be surrogate biomarkers for GCS severity identifiable without in-hospital monitoring. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This study provides Class III evidence that peri-ictal brainstem posturing is associated with the GCS with more prolonged PGES and more severe breathing dysfunction.","Vilella, Laura; Lacuey, Nuria; Hampson, Johnson P; Zhu, Liang; Omidi, Shirin; Ochoa-Urrea, Manuela; Tao, Shiqiang; Rani, M R Sandhya; Sainju, Rup K; Friedman, Daniel; Nei, Maromi; Strohl, Kingman; Scott, Catherine; Allen, Luke; Gehlbach, Brian K; Hupp, Norma J; Hampson, Jaison S; Shafiabadi, Nassim; Zhao, Xiuhe; Reick-Mitrisin, Victoria; Schuele, Stephan; Ogren, Jennifer; Harper, Ronald M; Diehl, Beate; Bateman, Lisa M; Devinsky, Orrin; Richerson, George B; Ryvlin, Philippe; Zhang, G Q; Lhatoo, Samden D",Neurology,72,16

Radiological studies were performed to identify anatomically distinct types of fistulas. An algorithm was elaborated for the classification and evolving treatment of each type of fistula. RESULTS Twenty post-LSG fistulas were studied (13 [2.5%] from our center, 7 referred) with a mean body mass index of 43.1 ± 10.2 kg/m2 (32.0-76.0) and mean age of 33.1 ± 11.4 years (20.0-56.0). In all cases, the clinically suspected diagnosis was radiologically confirmed by water-soluble upper gastrointestinal series and double-contrast abdomino-pelvic CT scan. Three anatomical fistula types were characterized: type I, a small leak with no collection; type II, a leak with associated intra-abdominal abscess; and type III, a leak with multiple internal or external abscesses, a complex fistula. In accord with our algorithm, patients without sepsis received conservative treatment initially; this was sufficient for type I leaks. Type II abscesses received internal or external percutaneous drainage, and in some cases, stenting or endoprosthesis. Surgery was reserved for failure of conservative options and type III fistula. In cases of sepsis, surgery was mandatory. CONCLUSION A radiologically defined, anatomically based classification system and treatment algorithm proved effective in clinical management of post-LSG fistula.","Al Hajj, G; Chemaly, R",Obesity surgery,72,24

Because the thalamus is important in pain control, gene expression in the lateral thalamus (ventral posteromedial, ventral posterolateral, reticular thalamic nuclei) was screened at different phases of the estrous cycle. Gene expression changes in Sprague-Dawley rats were further analyzed by real-time PCR and ELISA and plasma estradiol levels were measured by RIAs at different phases of the estrous cycle. Our results indicated that both the RNA and protein expression of glutamate decarboxylase 1 and 2 (GAD1, GAD2), GABA(A) receptor-associated protein like 1 (GABARAPL1), and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) significantly increased in the lateral thalamus when plasma estradiol levels were elevated. Estradiol levels were elevated during the proestrus and estrus phases of the estrous cycle. Estrogen receptor α (ERα) was observed to be co-localized in thalamic cells and thalamic infusion of an ERα antagonist significantly reduced GAD1 and VGAT transcript. GAD1, GAD2, GABARAPL1, and VGAT have been shown to effect neuronal responses suggesting that attenuation of pain during the estrous cycle can be dependent, in part, through estradiol induced changes in thalamic gene expression.","Umorin, Mikhail; Stinson, Crystal; Bellinger, Larry L; Kramer, Phillip R",Journal of cellular physiology,72,7

OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy and safety of oseltamivir and maxingshigan-yinqiaosan in treating uncomplicated H1N1 influenza. DESIGN Prospective, nonblinded, randomized, controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00935194) SETTING Eleven hospitals from 4 provinces in China. PATIENTS 410 persons [corrected] aged 15 to 69 [corrected] years with laboratory-confirmed H1N1 influenza. INTERVENTION Oseltamivir, 75 mg twice daily; maxingshigan-yinqiaosan decoction (composed of 12 Chinese herbal medicines, including honey-fried Herba Ephedrae), 200 mL 4 times daily; oseltamivir plus maxingshigan-yinqiaosan; or no intervention (control). Interventions and control were given for 5 days. MEASUREMENTS Primary outcome was time to fever resolution. Secondary outcomes included symptom scores and viral shedding determined by using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS Significant reductions in the estimated median time to fever resolution compared with the control group (26.0 hours [95% CI, 24.0 to 33.0 hours]) were seen with oseltamivir (34% [95% CI, 20% to 46%]; P < 0.001), maxingshigan-yinqiaosan (37% [CI, 23% to 49%]; P < 0.001), and oseltamivir plus maxingshigan-yinqiaosan (47% [CI, 35% to 56%]; P < 0.001). Time to fever resolution was reduced by 19% (CI, 0.3% to 34%; P = 0.05) with oseltamivir plus maxingshigan-yinqiaosan compared with oseltamivir. The interventions and control did not differ in terms of decrease in symptom scores (P = 0.38). Two patients who received maxingshigan-yinqiaosan reported nausea and vomiting. LIMITATIONS Participants were young and had mild H1N1 influenza virus infection. Missing viral data precluded definitive conclusions about viral shedding. CONCLUSION Oseltamivir and maxingshigan-yinqiaosan, alone and in combination, reduced time to fever resolution in patients with H1N1 influenza virus infection. These data suggest that maxingshigan-yinqiaosan may be used as an alternative treatment of H1N1 influenza virus infection.

Research has shown, however, that the nested three-parameter model suffers from issues of unidentifiability (San Martín et al. in Psychometrika 80:450-467, 2015), which places concern on the identifiability of the four-parameter model. Borrowing from recent advances in the identification of cognitive diagnostic models, in particular, the DINA model (Gu and Xu in Stat Sin https://doi.org/10.5705/ss.202018.0420 , 2019), a new model is proposed with restrictions inspired by this new literature to help with the identification issue. Specifically, we show conditions under which the four-parameter model is strictly and generically identified. These conditions inform the presentation of a new exploratory model, which we call the dyad four-parameter normal ogive (Dyad-4PNO) model. This model is developed by placing a hierarchical structure on the DINA model and imposing equality constraints on a priori unknown dyads of items. We present a Bayesian formulation of this model, and show that model parameters can be accurately recovered. Finally, we apply the model to a real dataset.","Kern, Justin L; Culpepper, Steven Andrew",Psychometrika,72,5

A thermal suit is an option for passive insulation. However, active warming is known to be more effective. Therefore, we hypothesised a forced-air warming unit connected to the thermal suit is superior to a commercial forced-air warming blanket and a warming mattress in breast cancer surgery. METHODS Forty patients were randomised to this prospective, clinical trial to wear either the thermal suit or conventional hospital clothes under general anaesthesia. The Thermal suit group had a forced-air warming unit set to 38 °C and connected to the legs of the suit. The Hospital clothes group had a lower body blanket set to 38 °C and a warming mattress set to 37 °C. Core temperature was measured with zero-heat-flux sensor. The primary outcome was core temperature on admission to the recovery room. RESULTS There was no difference in mean core temperatures at anaesthetic induction (P=0.4) or on admission to the recovery room (P=0.07). One patient in the Thermal suit group (5%) vs. six patients in the Hospital clothes group (32%) suffered from intraoperative hypothermia (P=0.04, 95% CI 1.9 to 49%). Mean skin temperatures were higher in the Thermal suit group during anaesthesia. No burns or skin irritations were reported. Two patients in the Thermal suit group sweated. CONCLUSIONS A thermal suit connected to a forced-air warming unit was not superior to a commercial forced-air warming blanket, although the incidence of intraoperative hypothermia was lower in patients treated with a thermal suit.","Lauronen, Sirkka-Liisa; Mäkinen, Marja-Tellervo; Annila, Päivi; Huhtala, Heini; Yli-Hankala, Arvi; Kalliomäki, Maija-Liisa",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,72,26

The CT characteristics of airway dimensions that differentiate COPD subjects with BDR from those without BDR have not been well described. We aimed to assess airway dimensions in COPD subjects with and without BDR. METHODS We analyzed subjects with GOLD 1-4 disease in the COPDGene® study who had CT airway analysis. We divided patients into two groups: BDR + (post bronchodilator ΔFEV1 ≥ 10%) and BDR-(post bronchodilator ΔFEV1 < 10%). The mean wall area percent (WA%) of six segmental bronchi in each subject was quantified using VIDA. Using 3D SLICER, airway wall thickness was also expressed as the square root wall area of an airway of 10 mm (Pi10) and 15 mm (Pi15) diameter. %Emphysema and %gas trapping were also calculated. RESULTS 2355 subjects in the BDR-group and 1306 in the BDR + group formed our analysis. The BDR + group had a greater Pi10, Pi15, and mean segmental WA% compared to the BDR-group. In multivariate logistic regression using gender, race, current smoking, history of asthma, %emphysema, %gas trapping, %predicted FEV1, and %predicted FVC, airway wall measures remained independent predictors of BDR. Using a threshold change in FEV1 ≥ 15% and FEV1 ≥ 12% and 200 mL to divide patients into groups, the results were similar. CONCLUSION BDR in COPD is independently associated with CT evidence of airway pathology. This study provides us with greater evidence of changes in lung structure that correlate with physiologic manifestations of airflow obstruction in COPD.","Kim, Victor; Desai, Parag; Newell, John D; Make, Barry J; Washko, George R; Silverman, Edwin K; Crapo, James D; Bhatt, Surya P; Criner, Gerard J",Respiratory research,72,5

METHODS We performed a subanalysis of the ""DWI-FLAIR mismatch for the identification of patients with acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset"" (PRE-FLAIR) and the ""AX200 for ischemic stroke"" (AXIS 2) trials. We developed a prediction model with data from the PRE-FLAIR study by backward logistic regression with the 4.5-hour time window as dependent variable and the following explanatory variables: age and median relative DWI (rDWI) signal intensity, interquartile range (IQR) rDWI signal intensity, and volume of the core. We obtained the accuracy of the model to predict the 4.5-hour time window and validated our findings in an independent cohort from the AXIS 2 trial. We compared the receiver operating characteristic curve to the visual DWI-FLAIR mismatch. RESULTS In the derivation cohort of 118 patients, we retained the IQR rDWI as explanatory variable. A threshold of 0.39 was most optimal in selecting patients within 4.5 hours after stroke onset resulting in a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 63%. The accuracy was validated in an independent cohort of 200 patients. The predictive value of the area under the curve of 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.64-0.80) was similar to the visual DWI-FLAIR mismatch (area under the curve = 0.65; 95% confidence interval 0.58-0.72; p for difference = 0.18). CONCLUSIONS An automated analysis of DWI performs at least as good as the visual DWI-FLAIR mismatch in selecting patients within the 4.5-hour time window.","Wouters, Anke; Cheng, Bastian; Christensen, Soren; Dupont, Patrick; Robben, David; Norrving, Bo; Laage, Rico; Thijs, Vincent N; Albers, Gregory W; Thomalla, Götz; Lemmens, Robin",Neurology,72,16

Surgical techniques seem to influence the development of AU, but this is still a matter of discussion. This study aims to compare the incidence of AU in circular-stapled (CS) versus linear-stapled (LS) gastrojejunostomy. METHODS Single-centre retrospective analysis of 241 (m 77 /f 164) consecutive patients (126 CS, 115 LS) with primary or revisional GBP including Roux-Y-Gastric Bypass (RYGB) and One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB) between 01/2014 and 01/2018. Follow-up with oesophagogastroduodenoscopy was only performed in symptomatic patients. Age, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, smoking and medication were analyzed in both groups. The data are reported as total numbers (%) and mean ± standard deviation. RESULTS AU occurred significantly more often in the CS group than in the LS group (p = 0.0034). Moreover, refractory AU and the need for revisional surgery were higher in the CS group. Smoking correlates significantly with the development of AU, whereas other risk factors had no impact on its incidence. CONCLUSION Linear-stapled gastrojejunostomy with a long and narrow pouch should be the preferable procedure for reducing AU development risk. Smoking cessation minimizes the risk for AU and is a necessary part of the treatment.","Schäfer, Aline; Gehwolf, Philipp; Kienzl-Wagner, Katrin; Cakar-Beck, Fergül; Wykypiel, Heinz",Surgical endoscopy,72,1

However, a large proportion of patients remain nonresponsive to this pacing strategy. Left ventricular (LV) lead position is one of the main determinants of response to CRT. This study aims to clarify whether multimodality imaging guided LV lead placement improves clinical outcome after CRT. METHODS/DESIGN The ImagingCRT study is a prospective, randomized, patient- and assessor-blinded, two-armed trial. The study is designed to investigate the effect of imaging guided left ventricular lead positioning on a clinical composite primary endpoint comprising all-cause mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, or unchanged or worsened functional capacity (no improvement in New York Heart Association class and <10% improvement in six-minute-walk test). Imaging guided LV lead positioning is targeted to the latest activated non-scarred myocardial region by speckle tracking echocardiography, single-photon emission computed tomography, and cardiac computed tomography. Secondary endpoints include changes in LV dimensions, ejection fraction and dyssynchrony. A total of 192 patients are included in the study. DISCUSSION Despite tremendous advances in knowledge with CRT, the proportion of patients not responding to this treatment has remained stable since the introduction of CRT. ImagingCRT is a prospective, randomized study assessing the clinical and echocardiographic effect of multimodality imaging guided LV lead placement in CRT. The results are expected to make an important contribution in the pursuit of increasing response rate to CRT. TRIAL REGISTRATION Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01323686.

Radical nephroureterectomy with bladder cuff excision and subsequent mitomycin-C (MMC) bladder instillation to reduce recurrence risk is the gold standard for high risk upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UUTUC). We adapted a robot-assisted nephroureterectomy technique with precise distal ureteric dissection, bladder cuff excision and watertight bladder closure. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all patients undergoing RANU for UUTUC at our centre performed as a standardised transperitoneal procedure comprising of: bladder cuff excision, 2-layer watertight closure and intra-operative bladder leak test; without re-docking/repositioning of the robotic surgical system. Patient demographics, the timing of MMC instillation, adverse events (surgical and potentially MMC-related) and length of stay (LOS) were assessed according to the Clavien-Dindo (CD) classification. RESULTS Sixty-nine patients underwent a RANU with instillation of MMC. The median age was 70 (interquartile range [IQR] 62-78) years. Median day of MMC instillation was 2 (IQR 1-3) days and median LOS was 2 (IQR 2-4) days, with urethral catheter removal on day of discharge in all cases. Only CD complications Grade 1 occurred (7 patients, 10%). Five patients had ileus, 1 wound infection and 1 self-limiting delirium; all managed conservatively. No adverse events potentially related to MMC instillation were noted within 30 days postoperatively. CONCLUSION The use of intravesical MMC instillation given in the immediate post-operative period appears feasible and safe in patients undergoing RANU with intraoperative confirmation of a water-tight closure ensuring early catheter free discharge, with no significant adverse events. The potential reduction in intravesical recurrence in patients receiving early MMC needs to be assessed with longitudinal follow up studies.","Gulamhusein, A; Silva, P; Cullen, D; Tran, M; Mumtaz, F; Patki, P; Barod, R; Bex, A",BJU international,72,1

However, the mechanism by which TBI causes ALI/ARDS is not fully understood. Here we used a severe TBI model to examine the effects of a low-molecular-weight heparin, Enoxaparin on inflammasome activation and lung injury damage. We investigated whether Enoxaparin inhibits ALI and inflammasome signaling protein expression in the brain and lungs after TBI in mice. C57/BL6 mice were subjected to severe TBI and were treated with vehicle or 1 mg/kg Enoxaparin 30 minutes after injury. Lung and brain tissue were collected 24 hours post-TBI and were analyzed by immunoblotting for the expression of the inflammasome proteins caspase-1 and IL-1. In addition, lung tissue was collected for histological analysis to determine ALI scoring and neutrophil and macrophage infiltration post-injury. Our data show that severe TBI induces increased expression of inflammasome proteins caspase-1 and IL-1 in the brain and lungs of mice after injury. Treatment with enoxaparin attenuated inflammasome expression in the brain and lungs 24 hours after injury. Enoxaparin significantly decreased the ALI score as well as neutrophil and macrophage infiltration in the lungs at 24 hours after injury. This study demonstrates that Enoxaparin attenuates ALI and inhibits inflammasome expression in the brain and lungs after TBI. These findings support the hypothesis that inhibition of the neural-respiratory inflammasome axis that is activated following TBI may have therapeutic potential.","Kerr, Nadine; De Rivero Vaccari, Juan Pablo; Weaver, Cailey; Dietrich, W Dalton; Ahmed, Tahir; Keane, Robert W",Journal of neurotrauma,72,24

Eighty-one anatomists, from 29 countries responded to the survey; 80% indicated that they required medical/health-care students to dissect human cadavers (60% females-86% males, p=0.02). Most teachers recorded that dissection was an instrument for training undergraduate students, an instrument for the development of professional skills, and an instrument to help to control emotions in the future doctor rather than being only a means of teaching/learning anatomy facts. Males were more receptive to the concept that dissection helps to control emotions in the future doctor (p=0.02).

These mutations impair the LKB1-AMPK signaling, an important metabolic pathway associated with cell growth, proliferation and survival. Melanoma patients with BRAF mutations are usually treated with BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib, but responses are short-lived as drug resistant tumors metabolically switch to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to escape metabolic stress-induced BRAF inhibition. Additionally, a large subset of melanoma utilizes OXPHOS in their metabolism, which can confer de novo resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Therefore, uncoupling of OXPHOS to perturb energy homeostasis and to indirectly stimulate AMPK could be a novel treatment for melanoma and to overcome intrinsic and acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Here, we investigated the effects of SR4 and niclosamide, two small molecule mitochondria uncouplers, on the growth and proliferation of treatment-naïve and vemurafenib-resistant melanomas in vitro and in vivo. SR4 and niclosamide inhibited melanoma proliferation irrespective of BRAF/NRAS status. Melanomas with greater OXPHOS phenotype (higher OCR/ECAR), with LKB1 mutation, or with acquired resistance to vemurafenib displayed greater sensitivity to both uncouplers. More importantly, SR4 and niclosamide inhibited tumor growth in both treatment-naïve and vemurafenib-resistant xenograft mice models. Mechanistic studies indicate both uncouplers induced energetic stress, modulated the AMPK-mTOR pathway, and promoted apoptosis without affecting MEK-ERK MAPK signaling. These results suggest that uncouplers such as SR4 and niclosamide may be useful as first line treatment against melanoma regardless of BRAF/NRAS status, and as an adjuvant therapy for patients failing MAPK inhibitors.","Figarola, James L; Singhal, Jyotsana; Singhal, Sharad; Kusari, Jyotirmoy; Riggs, Arthur",Oncotarget,72,5

The RNA-binding protein Sam68 regulates differentiation processes by modulating splicing, polyadenylation, and stability of select transcripts. Herein, we found that Sam68 -/- mice display altered regulation of alternative splicing in the spinal cord of key target genes involved in synaptic functions. Analysis of the motor units revealed that Sam68 ablation impairs the establishment of neuromuscular junctions and causes progressive loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord. Importantly, alterations of neuromuscular junction morphology and properties in Sam68 -/- mice correlate with defects in muscle and motor unit integrity. Sam68 -/- muscles display defects in postnatal development, with manifest signs of atrophy. Furthermore, fast-twitch muscles in Sam68 -/- mice show structural features typical of slow-twitch muscles, suggesting alterations in the metabolic and functional properties of myofibers. Collectively, our data identify a key role for Sam68 in muscle development and suggest that proper establishment of motor units requires timely expression of synaptic splice variants.","De Paola, Elisa; Forcina, Laura; Pelosi, Laura; Pisu, Simona; La Rosa, Piergiorgio; Cesari, Eleonora; Nicoletti, Carmine; Madaro, Luca; Mercatelli, Neri; Biamonte, Filippo; Nobili, Annalisa; D'Amelio, Marcello; De Bardi, Marco; Volpe, Elisabetta; Caporossi, Daniela; Sette, Claudio; Musarò, Antonio; Paronetto, Maria Paola",Life science alliance,72,26

Thirty-eight ESRD patients (22 on HD and 16 in pre-dialysis) and 24 healthy volunteers were included. We compared the T cell immune profiles as in these patients. Among the effector T cell subset, the percentages of Th17 and Th2 cells were significantly higher in the ESRD group than in the healthy controls (P<0.05). The percentage of Th1 cells did not differ significantly between these groups. The percentages of Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells did not differ significantly (P>0.05) between the two subgroups within the ESRD group. The CCR4(-)CCR6(+)/CD4(+) T cell percentage was also significantly higher in the ESRD group. The naïve T cell (T(naïve)) percentage was significantly lower in the ESRD group, and the difference between patients and controls was greater in the pre-dialysis patients than in the HD patients (P<0.05, for each comparison). By contrast, the percentages of central memory T cells (T(CM)) and effector memory T (T(EM)) cells were significantly higher in the ESRD group. Interleukin-17 production by T(EM) cells was significantly higher in the ESRD group. The severity of uremia was related negatively to the T(naïve) cell percentage but positively to the T(CM) and T(EM) cell percentages. The percentages of T(EM) and CD45RA(+) T effector memory subsets of CD8(+) T cells were significantly higher in the ESRD group (P<0.05).

COVID-19 can manifest with cardiac and thrombotic presentations. Additionally, patients with cardiovascular comorbidities are at an increased risk of adverse outcomes related to COVID-19 infection. This in turn has led to a significant reduction in the provision of cardiac surgery with alternative management options utilized to address patients with significant disease. In terms of aortic valve disease, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) provides advantages over surgical aortic valve replacement in with a lower burden on healthcare resources. COVID-19 also resulted in changes in management strategies and as such TAVI is now being considered in younger- and low-risk patients. However, long term data with regard to TAVI is still unknown, and the use in patient groups that have been excluded in the large pivotal studies that established TAVI as an alternative to surgery has raised specific concerns in the use of TAVI as the preferred treatment choice. With the long term ramification unknown, it is essential that decisions are made with caution.","Shafi, Ahmed M A; Awad, Wael I",Journal of cardiac surgery,72,1

Increasing evidence suggests that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in cancer initiation and progression; however, their diagnostic values in cancers as the new potential biomarkers are still not fully understood. In the present study, by using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), we demonstrated that CYP24A1 and hsa_circ_0060927 were only transcribed in 33 and 25 out of 83 CRC tissues, respectively. In these samples, we demonstrated that CYP24A1 was up-regulated in both linear and circular forms (P < 0.05). Furthermore, we showed that CYP24A1and hsa_circ_0060927 transcription were induced after vitamin D treatment in HCT-116 and HT-29 colon cancer cell lines. Importantly, analysis of the ROC curve in expressed samples indicated that CYP24A1 and hsa_circ_0060927 could serve as the potential diagnostic markers of CRC, but due to the fact that these transcripts are not expressed in many samples, the diagnostic role of these transcripts could be rejected. Taken together, for the first time, the results of our study illustrated the expression levels hsa_circ_0060927 in CRC; however, further studies are required to validate the present results.","Sadeghi, Hossein; Heiat, Mohammad",Molecular biology reports,72,16

Techniques for reducing aerosolization and risk of transmission of COVID-19 during these procedures would be valuable to the neurosurgical community. The authors aimed to simulate the generation of small-particle aerosols during EES and craniectomy in order to develop methods to reduce the spread of aerosolized particles, and to test the effectiveness of these methods. METHODS This study was performed at the Anatomical Laboratory for Visuospatial Innovations in Otolaryngology and Neurosurgery at The Ohio State University. The following two scenarios were used to measure three different particle sizes (0.3, 2.5, and 10 µm) generated: 1) drilling frontotemporal bone, simulating a craniectomy; and 2) drilling sphenoid bone, simulating an endonasal approach. A suction mask device was created with the aim of reducing particle release. The presence of particles was measured without suction, with a single Frazier tip suction in the field, and with the suction mask device in addition to the Frazier suction tip. Particles were measured 12 cm from the craniectomy or endonasal drilling region. RESULTS In the absence of any aerosol-reducing devices, the number of particles measured during craniectomy was significantly higher than that generated by endonasal drilling. This was true regardless of the particle size measured (0.3 µm, p < 0.001; 2.5 µm, p < 0.001; and 10 µm, p < 0.001). The suction mask device reduced the release of particles of all sizes measured in the craniectomy simulation (0.3 µm, p < 0.001; 2.5 µm, p < 0.001; and 10 µm, p < 0.001) and particles of 0.3 µm and 2.5 µm in the single Frazier suction simulation (0.3 µm, p = 0.031; and 2.5 µm, p = 0.026). The suction mask device further reduced the release of particles of all sizes during EES simulation (0.3 µm, p < 0.001; and 2.5 µm, p < 0.001) and particles of 0.3 µm and 2.5 µm in the single Frazier suction simulation (0.3 µm, p = 0.033; and 2.5 µm, p = 0.048). Large particles (10 µm) were not detected during EES. CONCLUSIONS The suction mask device is a simple and effective means of reducing aerosol release during EES, and it could potentially be used during mastoidectomies. This could be a valuable tool to reduce the risk of procedure-associated viral transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hara, Takuma; Zachariah, Marcus A; Li, Ruichun; Martinez-Perez, Rafael; Carrau, Ricardo L; Prevedello, Daniel M",Journal of neurosurgery,72,1

One aspect of organizational behavior that can impact ethical culture and moral well-being is institutional betrayal. RESEARCH AIM The purpose of this concept analysis is to develop a conceptual understanding of institutional betrayal in nursing by defining the concept and differentiating it from other forms of betrayal. DESIGN This analysis uses the method developed by Walker and Avant. RESEARCH CONTEXT Studies were reviewed using health literature databases with no date restrictions. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Analysis was conducted using established guidelines for ethical research. FINDINGS Although institutional betrayal is a concept applied in the literature, there was a paucity of studies exploring the concept within nursing. Examples of the concept in the literature include violation of trust between organization (i.e. employer) and nurse, such as provision of inadequate workplace protections, ineffective or hostile management, and gaslighting of those who experience negative events. Examples of institutional betrayal have become more visible during the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION A conceptual definition of institutional betrayal is a deep violation of trust or confidence or violation of moral standards committed by an institution toward a nurse. This definition incorporates experiences and issues suggested by the literature. Outcomes are likely negative, including impacts on nurse psychological and workplace well-being. This concept likely fits within a framework of ethical workplaces and has conceptual relationships with moral distress and moral resilience. Further studies can help qualitatively explore and empirically measure this concept. CONCLUSION In the pursuit of improving the ethical culture of healthcare workplaces, this concept can provide meaningful insight into organizational behavior and its consequences. Naming and describing the concept can promote conceptual clarity and equip researchers, nurses, and leaders to identify and mitigate the issue.","Brewer, Katherine C",Nursing ethics,72,12

Two common African gene variants of APOL1, G1 and G2, protect against infection by species of trypanosomes that resist wild-type APOL1. At the same time, the protection predisposes humans to CKD, an elegant example of balanced polymorphism. However, the exact mechanism of APOL1-mediated podocyte damage is not clear, including APOL1's subcellular localization, topology, and whether the damage is related to trypanolysis. METHODS APOL1 topology in serum (HDL particles) and in kidney podocytes was mapped with flow cytometry, immunoprecipitation, and trypanolysis assays that tracked 170 APOL1 domain-specific monoclonal antibodies. APOL1 knockout podocytes confirmed antibody specificity. RESULTS APOL1 localizes to the surface of podocytes, with most of the pore-forming domain (PFD) and C terminus of the Serum Resistance Associated-interacting domain (SRA-ID), but not the membrane-addressing domain (MAD), being exposed. In contrast, differential trypanolytic blocking activity reveals that the MAD is exposed in serum APOL1, with less of the PFD accessible. Low pH did not detectably alter the gross topology of APOL1, as determined by antibody accessibility, in serum or on podocytes. CONCLUSIONS Our antibodies highlighted different conformations of native APOL1 topology in serum (HDL particles) and at the podocyte surface. Our findings support the surface ion channel model for APOL1 risk variant-mediated podocyte injury, as well as providing domain accessibility information for designing APOL1-targeted therapeutics.","Gupta, Nidhi; Wang, Xinhua; Wen, Xiaohui; Moran, Paul; Paluch, Maciej; Hass, Philip E; Heidersbach, Amy; Haley, Benjamin; Kirchhofer, Daniel; Brezski, Randall J; Peterson, Andrew S; Scales, Suzie J",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,72,31

AIMS The aim of this study was to determine if the appropriate choice of this tube could be based on the patients' height, weight, tracheal diameter (TD), or the left main stem bronchus diameter (LMBD) and also to determine the relationship between height and depth of insertion among Asians. SUBJECTS AND METHODS This was a retrospective review of 179 patients who were intubated with a left-sided DLT and also had a posterior-anterior view of a digital chest radiograph for tracheal and left main bronchus diameter measurements. Additional data collected included patients' demographics and DLT size used. RESULTS There were 123 (68.7%) males and 56 (31.3%) females with an overall mean age of 33.3 ± 16.3 years. Majority of the males (48.8%) used a size 39 Fr while females (46.4%) used a 35 Fr. There were weak correlations between DLT size with height (male: R2 = 0.222; female: R2 = 0.193), DLT size with weight (male: R2 = 0.109; female: R2 = 0.211), DLT size with TD (male: R2 = 0.027); female: R2 = 0.016), and DLT size with LMBD (male: R2 = 0.222; female: R2 = 0.193). There was a good correlation between depth of DLT inserted with patient's height for both genders. CONCLUSION The appropriate size of the left-sided DLT could not be predicted based on patients' height, weight, tracheal or left main bronchus diameter alone in Asians; however, the depth of insertion of the tube was dependent on the height in both genders.","Ideris, Siti Salwani; Che Hassan, Muhamad Rahimi; Abdul Rahman, Mohd Ramzisham; Ooi, Joanna Su Min",Annals of cardiac anaesthesia,72,31

Off-label IVT for ischemic stroke is common. We aimed to analyse its safety in a large database. METHODS This was a retrospective analysis of the safe implementation of treatments in stroke (SITS) thrombolysis registry with regard to 11 off-label criteria according to the European licence for alteplase. Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (SICH) according to SITS was defined as primary safety endpoint and SICH according to the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS II) definition and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke definition as secondary safety endpoints. Multivariable logistic regression analyses after replacing missing values using multiple imputations were performed. RESULTS Patients from 793 centres in 44 countries were included, mainly (95%) in Europe. A total of 56 258 patients who were treated with intravenous alteplase were included. Median age was 71 (IQR 61-78) years and median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 12 (IQR 7-17). A total of 16 740 (30%) patients received off-label IVT and 1037 (1.8%) patients suffered from SICH according to the SITS definition (SICH SITS). Median percentage of missing values per variable was 0.4%. The only two off-label criteria constituting independent positive and negative predictors for SICH SITS were high blood pressure (odds ratio, 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.80; P = 0.012) and minor stroke (odds ratio, 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.78; P = 0.002). Very severe stroke, previous stroke and diabetes, age and high glucose levels were additional independent predictors of SICH according to the ECASS II and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke definitions. CONCLUSIONS Thrombolysis appears to be safe with regard to SICH for most of the off-label criteria, especially for minor stroke, but is risky in patients with high blood pressure. Individual risk-benefit evaluation should be performed.","Mundiyanapurath, S; Hees, K; Ahmed, N; Wahlgren, N; Uhlmann, L; Kieser, M; Ringleb, P A; Hacke, W; Nagel, S",European journal of neurology,72,26

The goal of this study was to investigate how to treat hepatic portal bile duct diseases and perform jejunojejunostomy and cholangiojejunostomy totally laparoscopically. We evaluated the feasibility of TLRCJS in treating biliary tract diseases. METHODS TLRCJS were performed in 103 patients from January 2000 to August 2011. There were 28 cases of recurrent choledocholithiasis combined with stricture of the common bile duct (CBD) after several stone extractions, 3 patients with iatrogenic bile duct injury, 24 patients with choledochal cyst, 36 patients with hepatic portal cholangiocarcinoma, and 12 patients with cancer of the pancreatic head and periampullary cancer. All surgeries were performed through 5 trocars. First, laparoscopic surgery on the CBD was performed according to the original disease. The CBD was opened and stones were extracted in choledocholithiasis patients. In iatrogenic injury patients, strictured CBD was resected and repaired. Dilated CBD or choledochal cyst with tumor was transected. In patients with malignant jaundice, the CBD was opened longitudinally. At the same time, the bile duct was prepared for cholangiojejunostomy. Second, the positions of the laparoscope and surgeons were altered. The jejunal mesentery and jejunum were transected, and side-to-side jejunojejunostomy (JJS) was performed. The laparoscope and surgeon positions were exchanged again; the Rouxen-Y biliary limb was lifted close to the residual bile duct; and side-to-side or end-to-side choledochojejunostomy (CJS) was performed. Finally, an abdominal drainage tube was placed. RESULTS All the surgeries were performed successfully. The diameter of the residual bile duct ranged from 0.4 to 3.2 cm (average, 0.9 cm). Three patients had postoperative bile leakage and were treated from 1 week to approximately 1 month with abdominal drainage. Postoperative intraperitoneal hemorrhage and stress ulcer of the stomach occurred in 2 patients with biliary tract injury combined with obstructive jaundice. One with intraperitoneal hemorrhage was cured by another laparoscopic surgery. The other patient was cured after 2 days of abdominal drainage, antacids, and hemostatic drug therapy. The follow-up duration of 95 patients was 4 to 93 months (average, 48.3 months). The follow-up rate was 92.2% (95/103). Patients with cancer died of metastasis or cachexia during 14-month follow-up with no postoperative complication. Reflux cholangitis occurred in 3 patients 2, 3, and 5 years after the operation, respectively. No anastomotic stricture or other complication was found in other patients during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS TLRCJS is the best and first choice for patients with biliary tract diseases that need biliary-jejunal anastomosis. But it is essential that the surgeon has proficiency in laparoscopic surgeries.","Chen, Dexing; Zhu, Andong; Zhang, Zhibo",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,72,1

We postulated that in such a clinical scenario, when intubation and conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) are strongly recommended, the suction of secretions with fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FBO) may increase the chance of NPPV success. The objective of this pilot study was, firstly, to verify the safety and effectiveness of early FBO during NPPV and, secondly, to compare the hospital outcomes of this strategy versus a CMV-based strategy in patients with decompensated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to CAP who are not appropriate candidates for NPPV because of inefficient mucous clearance and hypercapnic encephalopathy (HE). METHODS This is a 12-month prospective matched case-control study performed in one respiratory semi-intensive care unit (RSICU) with expertise in NPPV and in one intensive care unit (ICU). Fifteen acutely decompensated COPD patients with copious secretion retention and HE due to CAP undergoing NPPV in RSICU, and 15 controls (matched for arterial blood gases, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation score III, Kelly-Matthay scale, pneumonia extension and severity) receiving CMV in the ICU were studied. RESULTS Two hours of NPPV significantly improved arterial blood gases, Kelly and cough efficiency scores without FBO-related complications. NPPV avoided intubation in 12/15 patients (80%). Improvement in arterial blood gases was similar in the two groups, except for a greater PaO2/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio with CMV. The rates of overall and septic complications, and of tracheostomy were lower in the NPPV group (20%, 20%, and 0%) versus the CMV group (80%, 60%, and 40%; P < 0.05). Hospital mortality, duration of hospitalisation and duration of ventilation were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS In patients with decompensated COPD due to CAP who are candidates for CMV because of HE and inability to clear copious secretions, NPPV with early therapeutic FBO performed by an experienced team is a feasible, safe and effective alternative strategy.","Scala, Raffaele; Naldi, Mario; Maccari, Uberto",Critical care,72,27

There is currently no fully effective treatment for cryptosporidiosis, which has stimulated interest in anticryptosporidial development over the last ∼10 years with numerous lead compounds identified including several tRNA synthetase inhibitors. In this study, we report the results of a dairy calf efficacy trial of the methionyl-tRNA (CpMetRS) synthetase inhibitor 2093 and the spontaneous emergence of drug resistance. Dairy calves experimentally infected with Cryptosporidium parvum initially improved with 2093 treatment, but parasite shedding resumed in two of three calves on treatment day five. Parasites shed by each recrudescent calf had different amino acid altering CpMetRS mutations, coding either an aspartate 243 to glutamate (D243E) or a threonine 246 to isoleucine (T246I) mutation. Transgenic parasites engineered to have either the D243E or T246I CpMetRS mutation using CRISPR/Cas9 grew normally but were highly 2093 resistant; the D243E and T246I mutant expressing parasites respectively had 2093 EC50s of 613- or 128-fold that of transgenic parasites with wild-type CpMetRS.

DESIGN Prospective randomized controlled trial. SETTING Operating room of Osaka Women's and Children's Hospital. PATIENTS Pediatric patients less than 5 years old who underwent cardiovascular surgery. INTERVENTIONS Ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization using the long-axis in-plane approach and short-axis out-of-plane approach. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The occurrence of posterior wall puncture was compared between the long-axis in-plane and short-axis out-of-plane approaches for ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization. Patients were randomly allocated to a long-axis group or a short-axis group and underwent ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization in the internal jugular vein using either the long-axis in-plane approach (long-axis group) or the short-axis out-of-plane approach (short-axis group). After exclusion, 97 patients were allocated to the long-axis (n = 49) or short-axis (n = 48) groups. Posterior wall puncture rates were 8.2% (4/49) and 39.6% (19/48) in the long-axis and short-axis groups, respectively (relative risk, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.076-0.56; p = 0.0003). First attempt success rates were 67.3% (33/49) and 64.6% (31/48) in the long-axis and short-axis groups, respectively (relative risk, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.78-1.39; p = 0.77). Overall success rates within 20 minutes were 93.9% (46/49) and 93.8% (45/48) in the long-axis and short-axis groups, respectively (relative risk, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.90-1.11; p = 0.98). CONCLUSIONS The long-axis in-plane approach for ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization is a useful technique for avoiding posterior wall puncture in pediatric patients, compared with the short-axis out-of-plane approach.","Takeshita, Jun; Tachibana, Kazuya; Nakajima, Yasufumi; Nagai, Gaku; Fujiwara, Ai; Hamaba, Hirofumi; Matsuura, Hideki; Yamashita, Tomonori; Shime, Nobuaki",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,72,7

The purpose of this study was (1) to assess two components of early lesion growth by distinguishing between water uptake and true net infarct growth and (2) to investigate potential treatment effects on edema-corrected net lesion growth. Sixty-two M1-MCA-stroke patients with acute multimodal and follow-up CT (FCT) were included. Ischemic lesion growth was calculated by subtracting the initial CTP-derived ischemic core volume from the LV in the FCT. To determine edema-corrected net lesion growth, net water uptake of the ischemic lesion on FCT was quantified and subtracted from the volume of uncorrected lesion growth. The mean lesion growth without edema correction was 20.4 mL (95% CI: 8.2-32.5 mL). The mean net lesion growth after edema correction was 7.3 mL (95% CI: -2.1-16.7 mL; p < 0.0001). Lesion growth was significantly overestimated due to ischemic edema when determined in early-FCT imaging. In 18 patients, LV was lower than the initial ischemic core volume by CTP.

Infants' distraction latencies (the amount of time they took to turn from the initial stimulus to the distractor) varied as a function of the interaction between the infants' attentional state at distractor onset and the characteristics of the stimuli. Variations in the visual characteristics of the distractor stimulus (solid rectangle vs. checkerboard) had a larger effect on distraction latency when infants were in a focused attentional state than when they were in a casual attentional state. Similarly, variations in the auditory characteristic of the distractor stimulus (1 intermittent tone vs. 2 alternating tones) had a larger effect when infants were engaged in a focused attentional state toward the multicomponent toys. Thus, infants' distractibility in this context reflects an interaction between the infants' attentional state and the competition between external stimuli for their attentional focus.","Oakes, Lisa M; Tellinghuisen, Donald J; Tjebkes, Terri L",Infancy : the official journal of the International Society on Infant Studies,72,1

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to investigate the incidence of increased platelet reactivity after CAS and to determine the factors related to it. METHODS Patients who underwent CAS were recruited prospectively. They received pre-procedural antiplatelet therapy comprising some combination of aspirin (100 mg/day), clopidogrel (75 mg/day), and/or cilostazol (200 mg/day) for a minimum of 7 days. ADP- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation were measured before and 4 days after CAS. Changes in platelet reactivity were reported as changes in the categorized platelet reactivity grade based on the effective dose 50%. Clinical characteristics of patients with and without increased platelet reactivity were compared. RESULTS Among 38 consecutive patients who underwent CAS, 18 (47%) exhibited increased platelet reactivity. Diabetes mellitus (OR 15.0; 95% CI 2.1 to 106.5; p=0.007) and carotid artery plaques exhibiting high-intensity signals (HIS) on time-of-flight MR angiography (TOF-MRA) (OR 25.2; 95% CI 2.0 to 316.2; p=0.013) were independently associated with increased platelet reactivity in a multivariate analysis.

The aim of this short-report is to highlight the potential consequences of a longer interval to surgery for IBD patients. METHODS The mean waiting time to elective surgery for IBD patients with active- and inactive disease (e.g. pouch surgery after subtotal colectomy) at the Amsterdam UMC, location AMC, between 2013-2015 were compared to colorectal cancer surgery. The IBD waiting times were correlated to disease complications (e.g. >5% weight loss, abscess formation) and additional health care consumption (e.g. (telephone)outpatient clinic appointment, hospital admission) during these waiting times. RESULTS The mean waiting was 10 weeks (SD 8) for patients with active disease (n=173) and 15 weeks (SD 16) for those with inactive disease (n=97), remarkably higher compared to colorectal cancer patients (5 weeks). While awaiting surgery, 1 out of 8 patients had to undergo surgery in an (semi-)acute setting. Additionally, 19% of patients with active disease had disease complications, and 44% needed additional health care. The rates were comparable for patients with inactive disease. CONCLUSIONS The current waiting time to surgery is not medically justified and creates a burden for health care resources. This issue should be brought to the attention of policy makers, as it requires a structural solution. It is time to also set a maximally acceptable waiting time to surgery for IBD patients.","Wasmann, Karin A",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,72,20

Approximately 1 % of newborns are congenitally infected and in up to 10 % of them the consequences are severe. Antenatal and postnatal treatments, although promising, are still under evaluation. Hygiene counseling to prevent CMV infection is important and should be systematic. OBJECTIVE To evaluate health care providers' awareness of CMV maternal and congenital infection in France. STUDY DESIGN A questionnaire on CMV infection was sent in 2018 by e-mail to obstetricians, pediatricians, midwives and laboratory physicians, and members of medical or midwifery associations. We evaluated their knowledge concerning CMV epidemiology, transmission, symptoms in adults, newborns and long-term effects (scores from 0 to 30) and compared the results with those of our 2012 published study. RESULTS Of the 597 respondents who completed the questionnaire, 91 % were unaware of the precise transmission route of CMV, 33 % wrongly thought thatin utero therapy for congenital CMV infection was a current standard of care in France, and less than half were familiar with the HAS (Haute Autorité de Santé) and CNGOF (Collège National des Gynécologues et Obstétriciens Français) recommendations. When respondents' knowledge of CMV was greater, patients were given more hygiene counseling. Between 2011 and 2018, knowledge improved among doctors and midwives concerning the route of transmission, the symptoms in adults, and the long-term effects of CMV infection. CONCLUSIONS Knowledge is improving among healthcare providers, but gaps remain. To bridge these gaps, health care providers should improve their knowledge about congenital CMV by various means: medical reviews, continuing medical education, meetings, conferences, the Internet. Moreover, greater knowledge will allow for more effective counseling of pregnant women, as recommended by HCSP and CNGOF in France.","Fellah, Thanina; Sibiude, Jeanne; Vauloup-Fellous, C; Cordier, A G; Guitton, S; Grangeot-Keros, L; Benachi, A; Mandelbrot, L; Picone, O",Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,72,31

Control programs in North America incorporate vaccination with modified live viral (MLV) or killed (KV) vaccine. BoHV-1 strains are isolated from diseased animals or fetuses after vaccination. There are markers for differentiating MLV from field strains using whole-genome sequencing and analysis identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Using multiple primer sets and sequencing of products permits association of BoHV-1 isolates with vaccines. To determine association between vaccine virus and strains isolated from clinical cases following vaccination, we analyzed 12 BoHV-1 isolates from animals with various clinical syndromes; 9 corresponded to BoHV-1.1 respiratory group. The remaining three corresponded to BoHV-1.2b, typically found in genital tracts of cattle. Four BoHV-1 isolates were identical to a vaccine strain; three were from post-vaccination abortion episodes with typical herpetic lesions whose dams had received MLV vaccine during pregnancy, and one from a heifer given a related MLV vaccine; Sequences of two respiratory isolates perfectly matched mutations characterizing RLB106 strain, a temperature sensitive mutant used in intranasal and parenteral vaccines. The last three respiratory strains clearly appeared related to a group of MLV vaccines. Previously the MLV vaccines were grouped into four groups based on SNPs patterns. In contrast with above-mentioned isolates that closely matched SNP patterns of their respective MLV vaccine virus, these 3 strains both lacked some and possessed a number of additional mutations compared to a group of MLV vaccine viral genome. Finding BoHV-1.2b in respiratory cases indicates focus should be given BoHV-1.2b as an emerging virus or a virus not recognized nor fully characterized in BRD.","Fulton, R W; d'Offay, J M; Eberle, R; Moeller, R B; Campen, H Van; O'Toole, D; Chase, C; Miller, M M; Sprowls, R; Nydam, D V",Vaccine,72,1

With the goal of performing disease quantification in lymph node (LN) stations without explicit nodal delineation, this paper presents a novel approach for disease quantification (DQ) by automatic recognition of LN zones and detection of malignant lymph nodes within thoracic LN zones via positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) images. Named AAR-LN-DQ, this approach decouples DQ methods from explicit nodal segmentation via a LN recognition strategy involving a novel globular filter and a deep neural network called SegNet. METHOD The methodology consists of four main steps: (a) Building lymph node zones models by automatic anatomy recognition (AAR) method. It incorporates novel aspects of model building that relate to finding an optimal hierarchy for organs and lymph node zones in the thorax. (b) Recognizing lymph node zones by the built lymph node models. (c) Detecting pathologic LNs in the recognized zones by using a novel globular filter (g-filter) and a multi-level support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Here, we make use of the general globular shape of LNs to first localize them and then use a multi-level SVM classifier to identify pathologic LNs from among the LNs localized by the g-filter. Alternatively, we designed a deep neural network called SegNet which is trained to directly recognize pathologic nodes within AAR localized LN zones. (d) Disease quantification based on identified pathologic LNs within localized zones. A fuzzy disease map is devised to express the degree of disease burden at each voxel within the identified LNs to simultaneously handle several uncertain phenomena such as PET partial volume effects, uncertainty in localization of LNs, and gradation of disease content at the voxel level. We focused on the task of disease quantification in patients with lymphoma based on PET/CT acquisitions and devised a method of evaluation. Model building was carried out using 42 near-normal patient data sets via contrast-enhanced CT examinations of their thorax. PET/CT data sets from an additional 63 lymphoma patients were utilized for evaluating the AAR-LN-DQ methodology. We assess the accuracy of the three main processes involved in AAR-LN-DQ via 5-fold cross validation: lymph node zone recognition, abnormal lymph node localization, and disease quantification. RESULTS The recognition and scale error for LN zones were 12.28 mm ± 1.99 and 0.94 ± 0.02, respectively, on normal CT data sets. On abnormal PET/CT data sets, the sensitivity and specificity of pathologic LN recognition were 84.1% ± 0.115 and 98.5% ± 0.003, respectively, for the g-filter-SVM strategy, and 91.3% ± 0.110 and 96.1% ± 0.016, respectively, for the SegNet method. Finally, the mean absolute percent errors for disease quantification of the recognized abnormal LNs were 8% ± 0.09 and 14% ± 0.10 for the g-filter-SVM method and the best SegNet strategy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Accurate disease quantification on PET/CT images without performing explicit delineation of lymph nodes is feasible following lymph node zone and pathologic LN localization. It is very useful to perform LN zone recognition by AAR as this step can cover most (95.8%) of the abnormal LNs and drastically reduce the regions to search for abnormal LNs. This also improves the specificity of deep networks such as SegNet significantly. It is possible to utilize general shape information about LNs such as their globular nature via g-filter and to arrive at high recognition rates for abnormal LNs in conjunction with a traditional classifier such as SVM. Finally, the disease map concept is effective for estimating disease burden, irrespective of how the LNs are identified, to handle various uncertainties without having to address them explicitly one-by-one.","Xu, Guoping; Udupa, Jayaram K; Tong, Yubing; Odhner, Dewey; Cao, Hanqiang; Torigian, Drew A",Medical physics,72,1

This article reviews a surgeon's experience with the use of robotic surgery for liver resections. METHODS From March 2002 to March 2009, 70 robotic liver resections were performed at 2 different centers by a single surgeon. The surgical procedure and postoperative outcome data were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS Malignant tumors were indications for resections in 42 (60%) patients, whereas benign tumors were indications in 28 (40%) patients. The median age was 60 years (range, 21-84) and 57% of patients were female. Major liver resections (≥ 3 liver segments) were performed in 27 (38.5%) patients. There were 4 conversions to open surgery (5.7%). The median operative time for a major resection was 313 min (range, 220-480) and 198 min (range, 90-459) for minor resection. The median blood loss was 150 mL (range, 20-1,800) for minor resection and 300 mL (range, 100-2,000) for major resection. The mortality rate was 0%, and the overall rate of complications was 21%. Major morbidity occurred in 4 patients in the major hepatectomies group (14.8%) and in 4 patients in the minor hepatectomies group (9.3%). All complications were managed conservatively and none required reoperation. CONCLUSION This preliminary experience shows that robotic surgery can be used safely for liver resections with a limited conversion rate, blood loss, and postoperative morbidity. Robotics offers a new technical option for minimally invasive liver surgery.","Giulianotti, Pier Cristoforo; Coratti, Andrea; Sbrana, Fabio; Addeo, Pietro; Bianco, Francesco Maria; Buchs, Nicolas Christian; Annechiarico, Mario; Benedetti, Enrico",Surgery,72,30

Objective To determine the independent associations of voluntary behavioral change, school closures, and bans on large gatherings with the incidence and mortality due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Design, Setting, and Participants This population-based, interrupted-time-series analysis of lagged independent variables used publicly available observational data from US states during a 60-day period from March 8 to May 18, 2020. The behavioral measures were collected from anonymized cell phone or internet data for individuals in the US and compared with a baseline of January 3 to February 6, 2020. Estimates were also controlled for several state-level characteristics. Exposures Days since school closure, days since a ban on gatherings of 10 or more people, and days since residents voluntarily conducted a 15% or more decline in time spent at work via Google Mobility data. Main Outcomes and Measures The natural log of 7-day mean COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Results During the study period, the rate of restaurant dining declined from 1 year earlier by a mean (SD) of 98.3% (5.2%) during the study period. Time at work declined by a mean (SD) of 40.0% (7.9%); time at home increased by a mean (SD) of 15.4% (3.7%). In fully adjusted models, a delay of 1 day in implementing mandatory school closures was associated with a 3.5% reduction (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.965; 95% CI, 0.946-0.984) in incidence, whereas each day of delay in behavioral change was associated with a 9.3% reduction (IRR, 0.907; 95% CI, 0.890-0.925) in incidence. For mortality, each day of delay in school closures was associated with a subsequent 3.8% reduction (IRR, 0.962; 95% CI, 0.926-0.998), and each day of delay in behavioral change was associated with a 9.8% reduction (IRR, 0.902; 95% CI, 0.869-0.936). Simulations suggest that a 2-week delay in school closures alone would have been associated with an additional 23 000 (95% CI, 2000-62 000) deaths, whereas a 2-week delay in voluntary behavioral change with school closures remaining the same would have been associated with an additional 140 000 (95% CI, 65 000-294 000) deaths. Conclusions and Relevance In light of the harm to children of closing schools, these findings suggest that policy makers should consider better leveraging the public's willingness to protect itself through voluntary behavioral change.","Zimmerman, Frederick J; Anderson, Nathaniel W",JAMA pediatrics,72,1

As such, the mainstay of therapy for chronic disorders of dizziness involves managing factors that exacerbate symptoms and adding vestibular rehabilitation or cognitive-behavioral therapy alone or in combination, as appropriate. These therapies are supplemented by serotonergic antidepressants that modulate sensory gating and reduce anxiety. Besides expectation management, ruling out concurrent disorders and recognizing behavioral and lifestyle factors that affect symptom severity are critical issues in reducing morbidity for each disorder. SUMMARY Many syndromes of chronic dizziness can be diagnosed by recognition of key features, although many symptoms overlap between these groups. Symptoms may be manageable and improve with time, but they are often incompletely relieved.","Cha, Yoon-Hee",Continuum,72,4

Although many centers routinely perform this procedure, relatively high recurrence rates have led many surgeons to question this approach. We sought to evaluate outcomes in our cohort of patients with an emphasis on recurrence rates and symptom improvement and their correlation with true radiologic recurrence seen on contrast imaging. METHODS We retrospectively identified 126 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic repair of a large paraesophageal hernia between 2000 and 2010. Clinical outcomes were reviewed, and data were collected regarding operative details, perioperative and postoperative complications, symptoms, and follow-up imaging. Radiologic evidence of any size hiatal hernia was considered to indicate a recurrence. RESULTS There were 95 female and 31 male patients with a mean age (±standard deviation) of 71±14 years. Laparoscopic repair was completed successfully in 120 of 126 patients, with 6 operations converted to open procedures. Crural reinforcement with mesh was performed in 79% of patients, and 11% underwent a Collis gastroplasty. Fundoplications were performed in 90% of patients: Nissen (112), Dor (1), and Toupet (1). Radiographic surveillance, obtained at a mean time interval of 23 months postoperatively, was available in 89 of 126 patients (71%). Radiographic evidence of a recurrence was present in 19 patients (21%). Reoperation was necessary in 6 patients (5%): 5 for symptomatic recurrence (4%) and 1 for dysphagia (1%). The median length of stay was 4 days. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair results in an excellent outcome with a short length of stay when performed at an experienced center. Radiologic recurrence is observed relatively frequently with routine surveillance; however, many of these recurrences are small, and few patients require correction of the recurrence. Furthermore, these small recurrent hernias are often asymptomatic and do not seem to be associated with the same risk of severe complications developing as the initial paraesophageal hernia.","Latzko, Michael; Borao, Frank; Squillaro, Anthony; Mansson, Jonas; Barker, William; Baker, Thomas",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,72,1

This study prospectively investigates the diagnostic accuracy of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for staging and detection of recurrence in primary CC. MATERIAL AND METHODS PET/CT for preoperative staging was performed in 66 prospectively included patients with primary CC. Diagnostic accuracy for PET/CT and CT was analyzed. In addition to routine follow up, 42 stages I-III CC patients had postoperative PET/CT examinations every 6 months for 2 years. Serological levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), carcinoembryonic antigen, and liberated domain I of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor were analyzed. RESULTS Accuracy for tumor, nodal, and metastases staging by PET/CT were 82% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 70; 91), 66% (CI: 51; 78), and 89% (CI: 79; 96); for CT the accuracy was 77% (CI: 64; 87), 60% (CI: 46; 73), and 69% (CI: 57; 80). Cumulative relapse incidences for stages I-III CC at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months were 7.1% (CI: 0; 15); 14.3% (CI: 4; 25); 19% (CI: 7; 31), and 21.4% (CI: 9; 34). PET/CT diagnosed all relapses detected during the first 2 years. High preoperative TIMP-1 levels were associated with significant hazards toward risk of recurrence and shorter overall survival. CONCLUSIONS This study indicates PET/CT as a valuable tool for staging and follow up in CC. TIMP-1 provided prognostic information potentially useful in selection of patients for intensive follow up.","Engelmann, Bodil Elisabeth; Loft, Annika; Kjær, Andreas; Nielsen, Hans Jørgen; Berthelsen, Anne Kiil; Binderup, Tina; Brinch, Kim; Brünner, Nils; Gerds, Thomas Alexander; Høyer-Hansen, Gunilla; Kristensen, Michael Holmsgaard; Kurt, Engin Yeter; Latocha, Jan Erik; Lindblom, Gunnar; Sloth, Carsten; Højgaard, Liselotte",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,72,33

The long and narrow scanner gantry makes loud noises and may cause anxiety. To complete the procedure, children and adolescents are often sedated or receive general anaesthesia. Our primary aim is to determine whether non-pharmacological interventions designed to mentally prepare, support or distract children and adolescents are effective in reducing the need for sedation and general anaesthesia. METHODS We will conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis by searching the following electronic databases: Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase and CENTRAL, as well as databases for ongoing trials. Eligibility criteria are based on the participants, intervention, comparator and outcome (PICO) framework. We will include intervention studies with comparator group(s) with no restriction on date. Two reviewers will independently screen titles/abstracts, and three reviewers will assess the full texts of potentially relevant studies. Data will be extracted, and the methodological quality will be assessed using Cochrane risk of bias tools. If the data allow, we will perform a meta-analysis using a random effects model on the primary outcome, sedation/general anaesthesia. A narrative synthesis will supplement the statistical analysis. Quality of evidence for the primary outcome will be assessed using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluations (GRADE) approach.

Immunotherapy via programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade has shown benefits for gastric cancer. Epigenetic DNA methylation critically regulates cancer immune checkpoints. We investigated how the natural compound oleanolic acid (OA) affected PD-L1 expression in gastric cancer cells. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) at 20 ng/mL was used to stimulate human gastric cancer MKN-45 cells. IL-1β significantly increased PD-L1 expression, which was abolished by OA. Next, OA-treated MKN-45 cells were co-cultured with activated and PD-1-overexpressing Jurkat T cells. OA restored IL-2 levels in the co-culture system and increased T cell killing toward MKN-45 cells. Overexpression of PD-L1 eliminated OA-enhanced T cell killing capacity; however, PD-1 blocking antibody abrogated the cytotoxicity of T cells. Moreover, OA abolished IL-1β-increased DNA demethylase activity in MKN-45 cells. DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine rescued OA-reduced PD-L1 expression; whereas DNA demethylation inhibitor gemcitabine inhibited PD-L1 expression, and, in combination with OA, provided more potent inhibitory effects. Furthermore, OA selectively reduced the expression of DNA demethylase TET3 in IL-1β-treated MKN-45 cells, and overexpression of TET3 restored OA-reduced PD-L1 expression. Finally, OA disrupted nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling IL-1β-treated MKN-45 cells, and overexpression of NF-κB restored OA downregulation of TET3 and PD-L1. The cytotoxicity of T cells toward MKN-45 cells was also weakened by NF-κB overexpression. Altogether, OA blocked the IL-1β/NF-κB/TET3 axis in gastric cancer cells, leading to DNA hypomethylation and downregulation of PD-L1. Our discoveries suggested OA as an epigenetic modulator for immunotherapy or an adjuvant therapy against gastric cancer.","Lu, Xirong; Li, Yuyi; Yang, Wei; Tao, Minghao; Dai, Yanmiao; Xu, Jinkang; Xu, Qianfei",Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,72,28

Senior nursing students saw the elimination of in-person clinical opportunities in the final months prior to graduation as health care facilities restricted access to essential personnel in an effort to minimize transmission of the virus and conserve personal protective equipment. METHOD To fulfill course requirements, faculty created a COVID-19 assignment that implored students to research the most current infection control recommendations for COVID-19 and to describe the impacts of the virus on nursing care, patients, families, interdisciplinary collaboration, and public safety. RESULTS The COVID-19 assignment fostered clinical reasoning and encouraged personal reflection with application to practice. Students reported that the assignment greatly enhanced knowledge and awareness of COVID-19.

Oxidative stress and inflammation might play a role in migraine pathogenesis and the mood disorders. Considering the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), this study was designed to investigate its effect on oxidative, inflammatory and mood conditions in women with episodic migraine. METHODS In total 92 women with episodic migraine participated in the study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups, receiving a 300 mg capsule of ALA or placebo twice daily for 3 months. To assess the oxidative and inflammatory status, the serum levels of total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidant status (TOS), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), oxidative stress index (OSI) and C - reactive protein (CRP) were determined at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. A depression, anxiety, stress scale (DASS-21-items) questionnaire was used to evaluate mood status. RESULTS Finally, 79 patients reached the final analysis stage. At the end of the intervention, a significant decrease in the serum levels of MDA (means difference (MD): -0.83, 95% confidence intervals (CI): -1.04,-0.62 nmol/ml vs MD: -0.32, CI: -0.48,-0.15 nmol/ml; P <0.001) and CRP (MD:-0.78, CI: -1.17,-0.39 mg/L vs MD:-0.63, CI: -1.80,0.52 mg/L; P <0.001) was observed in the ALA as compared with the placebo group. But changes in serum GSH (P=0.086), TAC (P=0.068), TOS (P=0.225), and OSI (P=0.404) were not statistically significant. In addition, depression, anxiety, and stress (with p<0.001, in all cases) had significantly decreased in the intervention as compared with the control group. CONCLUSION The results of this study suggest that ALA supplementation for 3 months has beneficial effects on improving the oxidative, inflammatory and mood conditions of patients suffering from episodic migraine.","Rezaei Kelishadi, Mahnaz; Alavi Naeini, Amirmansour; Askari, Gholamreza; Khorvash, Fariborz; Heidari, Zahra",International journal of clinical practice,72,5

The clinical spectrum caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections can range from asymptomatic infection to mild undifferentiated febrile illness to severe respiratory disease with multiple complications. Elderly patients (aged 60 and above) with co-morbidities such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus appear to be at highest risk for a severe disease outcome. To protect against pulmonary immunopathology caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, the host primarily depends on two distinct defence strategies: resistance and disease tolerance. Resistance is the ability of the host to suppress and eliminate incoming viruses. By contrast, disease tolerance refers to host responses that promote host health regardless of their impact on viral replication. Disruption of either resistance or disease tolerance mechanisms or both could underpin predisposition to elevated risk of severe disease during viral infection. Aging can disrupt host resistance and disease tolerance by compromising immune functions, weakening of the unfolded protein response, progressive mitochondrial dysfunction, and altering metabolic processes. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying declining host defence in elderly individuals could thus pave the way to provide new opportunities and approaches for the treatment of severe COVID-19.","Mok, Darren Z L; Chan, Candice Yuen Yue; Ooi, Eng Eong; Kuan Rong, Chan",The FEBS journal,72,20

We hypothesized that the direct application of fat grafts to the surfaces of radiation-induced ulcers is also effective. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a combination treatment comprising fat injections around ulcers and fat grafts on ulcer surfaces. The dorsal skin of inbred rats was irradiated at a single dose of 20 Gy before producing ulcers. After the inguinal fat was harvested using the Coleman technique, the rats were divided into four groups: Group 1, ulcer wounds were covered using dressing materials and staples only; Group 2, fat was injected around the ulcers using a cannula; Group 3, fat was grafted onto ulcer surfaces; and Group 4, a combination of fat injection around the ulcers and fat grafts onto ulcer surfaces was employed. The mean healing time (± standard deviation) of each group was as follows: Group 1, 16.0 ± 2.2 days; Group 2, 14.5 ± 2.0 days; Group 3, 15.2 ± 1.7 days; and Group 4, 13.4 ± 1.0 days. The healing time of Group 4 was significantly shorter than that of Group 1 (p = .0005) and Group 3 (p = .023). In both groups that received fat grafts, fat tissue was observed in the dermis on hematoxylin-eosin-stained slides at 4 and 8 weeks after the ulcers were created. In conclusion, the combination treatment of fat grafted onto ulcer surfaces and injected around ulcers was effective in accelerating the epithelization of radiation-induced ulcers.","Fukuba, Michiko; Uozaki, Hiroshi; Komuro, Yuzo",Journal of plastic surgery and hand surgery,72,23

In response to anthropogenic changes, including food subsidies, some migratory animals are now migrating shorter distances or halting migration altogether and forming resident populations. Recent studies suggest that shifts in migratory behaviour can alter the risk of infection for wildlife. Although migration is commonly assumed to enhance pathogen spread, for many species, migration has the opposite effect of lowering infection risk, if animals escape from habitats where pathogen stages have accumulated or if strenuous journeys cull infected hosts. Here, we summarize responses of migratory species to supplemental feeding and review modelling and empirical work that provides support for mechanisms through which resource-induced changes in migration can alter pathogen transmission. In particular, we focus on the well-studied example of monarch butterflies and their protozoan parasites in North America. We also identify areas for future research, including combining new technologies for tracking animal movements with pathogen surveillance and exploring potential evolutionary responses of hosts and pathogens to changing movement patterns. Given that many migratory animals harbour pathogens of conservation concern and zoonotic potential, studies that document ongoing shifts in migratory behaviour and infection risk are vitally needed.This article is part of the theme issue 'Anthropogenic resource subsidies and host-parasite dynamics in wildlife'.","Satterfield, Dara A; Marra, Peter P; Sillett, T Scott; Altizer, Sonia","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

OBJECTIVES To generate deep, mid-interventricular septal (IVS) lesions using high-intensity ultrasound (US) from an endocardial catheter-based approach. METHODS Irrigated US catheters (12 Fr) were fabricated with 3x5 mm transducers of 5.0, 6.5 and 8.0 MHz frequencies, and compared in an ex vivo perfused myocardial ablation model. In vivo septal ablation in swine (n=12) was performed via femoral venous access to the right ventricle. Lesions were characterized by echocardiography, cardiac MRI and electroanatomic voltage mapping pre- and post-ablation, and at 30 days. Four animals were euthanized immediately post-ablation to compare acute and chronic lesion histology and gross pathology. RESULTS In ex vivo models, maximal lesion depth and volume was achieved by 6.5 MHz catheters, which were used in vivo. Lesion depth by gross pathology was similar post-ablation (10.8[95% CI:9.9,12.4] mm) and at 30 days (11.2[CI:10.6,12.4] mm, p=0.56). Lesion volume decreased post-ablation to 30 days (255[CI:198,440] to 162[CI:133,234] mm3 p=0.05), yet transmurality increased 58%(CI:50,76) to 81%(CI:74,93), attributable to a reduction in IVS thickness (16.0±1.7 to 10.6±2.4 mm, p=0.007). MRI confirmed dense septal ablation by delayed enhancement, with increased T1 time post-ablation and at 30 days, and increased T2 time only post-ablation. Voltage mapping of both sides of IVS demonstrated reduced unipolar (but not bipolar) voltage along the IVS. CONCLUSIONS High-intensity US catheter ablation may be an effective treatment for mid-myocardial or epicardial VAs from an endocardial approach.","Nazer, Babak; Giraud, David; Zhao, Yan; Hodovan, James; Elman, Miriam R; Masri, Ahmad; Gerstenfeld, Edward P; Lindner, Jonathan R",Heart rhythm,72,16

In premenopausal women increased signalling of angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7) via the Mas receptor has been linked to lower cardiovascular risk. Since stimulation of the Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis protects the endothelial barrier in acute lung injury (ALI), we hypothesised that increased Ang-(1-7)/Mas signalling may protect females over males in ALI/ARDS.Clinical data were collected from Charité inpatients. Sex differences in ALI were assessed in wild-type (WT) and Mas-deficient (Mas-/- ) mice. Endothelial permeability was assessed as weight change in isolated lungs and as trans-endothelial electrical resistance in vitroIn 734 090 Charité inpatients (2005-2016), ARDS had a higher incidence in men as compared to women. In murine ALI, male WT mice had more lung edema, protein leak, and histological evidence of injury than female WT mice. Lung weight change in response to platelet-activating factor (PAF) was more pronounced in male WT and female Mas-/- mice than female WT, whereas Mas receptor expression was higher in female WT lungs. Ovariectomy attenuated protection in female WT mice and reduced Mas receptor expression. In vitro, estrogen increased Mas receptor expression and attenuated endothelial leak in response to thrombin; this effect was alleviated by Mas receptor blockade.Improved lung endothelial barrier function protects female mice from ALI-induced lung edema. This effect is partially mediated via enhanced Ang-(1-7)/Mas signalling as a result of estrogen-dependent Mas expression.","Erfinanda, Lasti; Ravindran, Krishnan; Kohse, Franziska; Gallo, Kathleen; Preissner, Robert; Walther, Thomas; Kuebler, Wolfgang M",The European respiratory journal,72,17

METHODS Bilateral incisional hernias were created in Yucatan minipigs and repaired after 21 days. The repair site, including mesh and abdominal wall, was harvested after 1, 6, and 12 months and subjected to histologic analysis and uniaxial testing. Native abdominal wall without mesh was also subjected to uniaxial tensile testing. RESULTS Permacol(®) demonstrated significant improvement over time in every remodeling category except scaffold degradation, while remodeling characteristics of Strattice(®) remained relatively unchanged over time for every category except fibrous encapsulation and neovascularization. However, remodeling scores for Strattice(®) were already significantly higher after just 1 month compared to Permacol(®) in the categories of cellular infiltration, ECM deposition, and neovascularization, providing evidence of earlier remodeling of the non-crosslinked grafts compared to the crosslinked grafts. The tensile strength and stiffness of both crosslinked and non-crosslinked graft-tissue composites were greater than the tensile strength and stiffness of the native porcine abdominal wall in the very early post-operative period (1 month), but there was no difference in tensile strength or stiffness by the end of the study period (12 months). CONCLUSIONS HDMI collagen crosslinking of porcine dermis scaffolds reduces the early histologic remodeling profile but does not significantly impact the tensile strength or stiffness of the graft-tissue composites in a porcine model of ventral hernia repair.","Cavallo, J A; Greco, S C; Liu, J; Frisella, M M; Deeken, C R; Matthews, B D",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,72,19

It also poses new ones, such as by disentangling the various ways individuals do (and do not do) ethical consumption.

Apart from demographical changes, obese patients are especially prone to have oestrogen-dependent morbidities and neoplasias, of which laparoscopic treatment should be the standard of care. The increasing number of patients with BMI >40 is concerning, making it necessary to summarise considerations for safe and effective Gynaecological Laparoscopic Surgery. CONSIDERATIONS The sequel to successful laparoscopic surgery in obese patients comprises an interdisciplinary appreciation of laparoscopy. Preoperatively, anaesthetics and medical review are suggested to optimise treatment of comorbidities (i.e. infections and blood sugar levels). Positioning of the patient should consider anti-slip options and pannus fixation to ease laparoscopic access and decrease pressure to the chest. There is no standard port placement in obese patients and landmarks have to be the bony structures of the pelvis and ribs. Retraction of the bowel is essential and mobilisation of the sigmoid with fan retractors or endoloops can accomplish adequate vision. 30° scopes can be considered for vision ""around the obstacle"". An experienced assistant with anticipation of surgical steps is favourable for successful surgery completion. Intra-operatively, good surgical techniques are essential. Vessel sealing systems reduce the need for instrument changes and may be helpful in following visualised tissue planes. A transvaginal vault closure may be advantageous compared to laparoscopic closure and Endostiches may be preferred to close the fascia of large trocar sites under vision.","Hackethal, A; Brennan, D; Rao, A; Land, R; Obermair, A; Nicklin, J; Garrett, A; Nascimento, M; Crandon, A; Perrin, L; Chetty, N",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,72,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS From January 16, 2020 to March 28, 2020, among the 568 cases of COVID-19 patients diagnosed in Xiaogan Central Hospital, 64 cases of COVID-19 patients with diabetes were selected as the diabetic group, and 64 cases of COVID-19 patients with age and gender matching without diabetes were selected as the non-diabetic group, and their clinical data and pulmonary CT characteristics were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS Compared with the non-diabetic group, the proportion of patients in the diabetic group with chronic underlying disease was higher, and they were in more a serious condition at admission. Inflammation index and characteristics of glycolipid metabolism results showed that COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus were more likely to have elevated inflammatory markers and hypercoagulability, accompanied by hypoproteinaemia and glucose and lipid metabolism disorders. Treatment and clinic outcome results showed that the time of nucleic acid turning negative in the diabetic group was significantly longer than that in the non-diabetic group. Radiological data showed that COVID-19 combined with diabetes prolonged the time of detoxification in patients. CONCLUSION COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus and chronic hypertension are associated with increased inflammatory markers and disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism. These patients tend to develop serious diseases, especially the rapid progression of CT lesions in the lungs of patients with a wide range ofinvolvement, and prolonged absorption and detoxification time.","Yan, Yimin; Yang, Fang; Zhu, Xinxin; Wang, Min; Sun, Zhibing; Zhao, Tao; Yang, Xiaohong; Zou, Yi",Endokrynologia Polska,72,19

Integrated models of care can help address the rising burden of multi-morbidity. Although integration of care can occur at various levels and has been defined in numerous ways, our aim is to assess the effects of integration of service delivery at primary healthcare level in LMICs. METHODS We will consider randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies and interrupted time series that examine integrated models of care among people with multi-morbidities, of which diabetes or hypertension is one, living in LMICs. We will compare fully integrated models of care to stand-alone care, partially integrated models of care to stand-alone care and fully integrated models to partially integrated models of care. Primary outcomes include all-cause mortality, disease-specific morbidity, HbA1c, systolic blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Secondary outcomes include access to care, retention in care, adherence, continuity of care, quality of care and cost of care. We will conduct a comprehensive search in the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Control Trials, LILACS, Africa-Wide Information, CINAHL and Web of Science. In addition, we will search trial registries, relevant conference abstracts and check references lists of included studies. Selection of studies, data extraction and assessment of risk of bias will be performed independently by two review authors. We will resolve discrepancies through discussion with a third author. We will contact study authors in case of missing data. If included studies are sufficiently homogenous, we will pool results in a meta-analysis. Clinical heterogeneity related to the population, intervention, outcomes and context will be documented in table format and explored through subgroup analysis. We will assess χ2and I2 tests for statistical heterogeneity. We will use GRADE to make judgements about the certainty of evidence and present findings in a summary of findings table. DISCUSSION In light of limited evidence on the provision of comprehensive care for diabetes and hypertension, and its comorbidity in LMCIs, we believe that the findings of this systematic review will provide a synthesis of evidence on effective models of integrated care for diabetes and hypertension and their comorbidities at primary healthcare level. This will enable policy-makers to device policies and programs that are evidence informed.

In an attempt to recover NH4+ from LW, a novel electrochemical approach using a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) was developed and its efficacy was demonstrated in this study. The GDE-based electrochemical device, when operated at an air-flow rate of 20 mL/min, was free of back-diffusion flux, which is a fatal drawback of any membrane-based NH4+ separation approach. Continuous operation resulted in a nitrogen flux of 890 g N/m2d with synthetic LW and 770 g N/m2d with real LW at a current density of 10 mA/cm2. The electrochemical energy input was 7.42 kWh/kg N with synthetic LW and 9.44 kWh/kg N with real LW. Compared with the traditional stripping method, the GDE-based electrochemical system has a certain potential to be competitive, in terms of energy consumption. For instance, a rough-cost estimate based only on operating costs regarding chemical usage, air blowing, and water pumping revealed that the system consumed 13.44 kWh/kg N, whereas the conventional stripper required 27.6 kWh/kg N. This analysis showed that an electrochemical approach such as our GDE-based method can recover NH3, (particularly in gaseous form) from LW. In addition, with the future development of a smart operation method, as proposed and demonstrated in this study, the cost-effective implementation of a GDE-based method is feasible.","Lee, Gwangtaek; Kim, DongYeon; Han, Jong-In",Water research,72,1

Fourteen high-level players participated in this study in which five typical strokes (backhand top, forehand top, forehand spin, forehand smash, flick) were analysed. Surface electromyography activity (EMG) of eight muscles was recorded (gluteus maximus, biceps femoris, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, rectus femoris, gastrocnemius medialis, gastrocnemius lateralis, soleus) and normalised to the maximal activity measured during squat jump or isometric maximal voluntary contractions. The forehand spin, the forehand top and the forehand smash exhibited significant higher EMG amplitude when compared with other strokes. Both biceps femoris and gluteus maximus were strongly activated during the smash, forehand spin and forehand top (from 62.8 to 91.7% of maximal EMG activity). Both vastii and rectus femoris were moderately to strongly activated during the forehand spin (from 50.4 to 62.2% of maximal EMG activity) whereas gastrocnemii and soleus exhibited the highest level of activity during the smash (from 67.1 to 92.1% of maximal EMG activity). Our study demonstrates that offensive strokes, such as smash or forehand top, exhibit higher levels of activity than other strokes.","Le Mansec, Yann; Dorel, Sylvain; Hug, François; Jubeau, Marc",Sports biomechanics,72,1

The hypothesis was that Volulyte would provide better microvascular reactivity than Geloplasma. Forty patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery were randomly assigned to receive either Volulyte or Geloplasma as the exclusive priming solution of the cardiopulmonary bypass. To evaluate microvascular reactivity, postocclusive reactive hyperaemia was examined before and after cardiopulmonary bypass. Microvascular reactivity assessments included the rate of the occlusion and reperfusion slopes and reperfusion times. After cardiopulmonary bypass, increases in reperfusion time were significantly smaller in the Volulyte group (3 (-27 to 9 [-35 to 33]%) vs 29 (-17 to 76 [-34 to 137]%) in the Geloplasma group, p = 0.02 between groups). Rate of reperfusion increased in the Volulyte group (26 (-17 to 43 [-59 to 357])%), whereas it decreased in the Geloplasma group (-22 (-47 to 16 [-84 to 113])%), p = 0.02 between groups. The shorter reperfusion times and increased reperfusion rate suggest that Volulyte maintains better microvascular reactivity than Geloplasma.","Moerman, A; Van Eeckhout, C; Vanderstraeten, K; De Somer, F; Van Belleghem, Y; De Hert, S",Anaesthesia,72,12

Demain.,13.472552,4.9785666,2020-05-28,"OBJECTIVES We present our initial experience with the fourth-generation MitraClip™ (G4) system and propose preliminary criteria for device selection. BACKGROUND The MitraClip™ G4 system recently underwent a ""controlled release"" for transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair. The four new devices include technical improvements such as controlled gripper actuation (independent leaflet capture) and continuous left atrial pressure monitoring. To date, a patient-specific device selection algorithm, and the technology's impact on procedural times and success, have not been described. METHODS We present an initial multi-center experience and short-term outcomes with the new system, suggest procedural and imaging considerations, and propose initial guidance for device selection. RESULTS Sixty-one procedures performed by three operators at two centers between November 2019 and May 2020 were analyzed. At 30-day follow-up, there were three deaths (4.9%), four neurological events (6.6%), and seven re-hospitalizations (11.5%). Fifty-nine patients achieved device and procedural success (96.7%), and there was one device-related technical issue (1.6%). Compared to the same operators utilizing the third generation MitraClip™, the G4 system resulted in a significant reduction in the median number of clips used per patient (1 IQR 1-2 vs. 2 IQR 1-3, p = .023) and a trend toward shorter device times. CONCLUSION Based on our initial experience, we found that the MitraClip™ G4 system is associated with high procedural success and fewer devices needed per procedure. The expanded device options may allow a more targeted approach to the myriad of pathologic presentations of mitral regurgitation. This early experience should provide a foundational opportunity for further refinement.","Garcia-Sayan, Enrique; Raghunathan, Deepa; Li, Flora M; Dhoble, Abhijeet; Sheu, Richard D; Jelacic, Srdjan; Reisman, Mark; Smalling, Richard W; Mackensen, G Burkhard",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,72,1

However, there is limited information about the clinical characteristics of hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 or about interventions to control COVID-19 in hemodialysis centers. METHODS We collected data retrospectively through an online registration system that includes all patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis at 65 centers in Wuhan, China. We reviewed epidemiologic and clinical data of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and March 10, 2020. RESULTS Of 7154 patients undergoing hemodialysis, 154 had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. The mean age of the 131 patients in our analysis was 63.2 years; 57.3% were men. Many had underlying comorbidities, with cardiovascular disease (including hypertension) being the most common (68.7%). Only 51.9% of patients manifested fever; 21.4% of infected patients were asymptomatic. The most common finding on chest computed tomography (CT) was ground-grass or patchy opacity (82.1%). After initiating comprehensive interventions-including entrance screening of body temperature and symptoms, universal chest CT and blood tests, and other measures-new patients presenting with COVID-19 peaked at 10 per day on January 30, decreasing to 4 per day on February 11. No new cases occurred between February 26 and March 10, 2020. CONCLUSIONS We found that patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis were susceptible to COVID-19 and that hemodialysis centers were high-risk settings during the epidemic. Increasing prevention efforts, instituting universal screening, and isolating patients with COVID-19 and directing them to designated hemodialysis centers were effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19 in hemodialysis centers.","Xiong, Fei; Tang, Hui; Liu, Li; Tu, Can; Tian, Jian-Bo; Lei, Chun-Tao; Liu, Jing; Dong, Jun-Wu; Chen, Wen-Li; Wang, Xiao-Hui; Luo, Dan; Shi, Ming; Miao, Xiao-Ping; Zhang, Chun",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,72,9

METHODS Given the unmet need for novel pharmacodynamic HD biomarkers in the context of experimental huntingtin (htt)-lowering therapies, we investigated the levels of PDYN-derived peptides and neurofilament light (NfL) chain in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from HD patients (n = 16), matched controls (n = 55), and patients with other neurodegenerative disorders (n = 70). RESULTS PDYN-derived peptide levels were found to be substantially decreased in HD patients (P < 0.0001 in comparison to controls), whereas the NfL levels were elevated in all neurodegenerative disorders.

The survey was completed by nurses, midwives, doctors and allied health (AH) staff between 15 May and 10 June 2020. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 items (DASS-21) assessed the psychological well-being of respondents in the previous week.ResultsIn all, 668 people responded to the survey (nurses/midwives, n=391; doctors, n=138; AH staff, n=139). Of these, 108 (16.2%) had direct contact with people with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Approximately one-quarter of respondents reported symptoms of psychological distress. Between 11% (AH staff) and 29% (nurses/midwives) had anxiety scores in the mild to extremely severe ranges. Nurses and midwives had significantly higher anxiety scores than doctors (P<0.001) and AH staff (P<0.001). Direct contact with people with a COVID-19 diagnosis (P<0.001) and being a nurse or midwife (P<0.001) were associated with higher anxiety scores. Higher ratings of the health service's pandemic response and staff support strategies were protective against depression (P<0.001), anxiety (P<0.05) and stress (P<0.001).ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant effect on the psychological well-being of hospital clinical staff, particularly nurses and midwives. Staff would benefit from (additional) targeted supportive interventions during the current and future outbreaks of infectious diseases.What is known about the topic?The outbreak of COVID-19 is having, and will have, a considerable effect on health services. No Australian data about the effect of COVID-19 on the psychological well-being of hospital clinical staff are available.What does this paper add?Australia healthcare providers have experienced considerable emotional distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly nurses and midwives and clinical staff who have had direct contact with people with a COVID-19 diagnosis. In this study, nurses and midwives had significantly higher levels of anxiety, depression and stress during the pandemic than general Australian adult population norms, and significantly more severe anxiety symptoms than medical and AH staff. Despite a lower number of COVID-19 cases and a lower death rate than in other countries, the proportion of Australian hospital clinical staff experiencing distress is similar to that found in other countries.What are the implications for practitioners?Targeted well-being interventions are required to support hospital clinical staff during the current and future outbreaks of infectious diseases and other 'crises' or adverse events.","Holton, Sara; Wynter, Karen; Trueman, Melody; Bruce, Suellen; Sweeney, Susan; Crowe, Shane; Dabscheck, Adrian; Eleftheriou, Paul; Booth, Sarah; Hitch, Danielle; Said, Catherine M; Haines, Kimberley J; Rasmussen, Bodil",Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association,72,1

BACKGROUND Bariatric surgery has become an established treatment for extreme obesity. Bariatric surgery mortality has steadily declined with current rates of less than 0.5%. However, significant variation in the mortality rates has been reported for specific patient cohorts and among bariatric centers. METHODS Clinical outcome data from 185,315 bariatric surgery patients from the Bariatric Outcome Longitudinal Database were reviewed. Of these, 157,559 patients had either documented 30 or more day follow-up data, including mortality. Multiple demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical factors were analyzed by univariate analysis for their association with 30-day mortality after gastric bypass. Variables found to be significant were entered into a multiple logistic regression model to identify factors independently associated with 30-day mortality. On the basis of these results, a RYGB mortality risk score was developed. RESULTS The overall 30-day mortality rate for the entire bariatric surgery cohort was 0.1%. Of the 81,751 RYGB patients, the mortality rate was 0.15%. Factors significantly associated with 30-day gastric bypass mortality included increasing body mass index (BMI) (P<0.0001), increasing age (P<0.005), male gender (P<0.001), pulmonary hypertension (P<0.0001), congestive heart failure (P=0.0008), and liver disease (P=0.038). When the RYGB risk score was applied, a significant trend (P<0.0001) between increasing risk score and mortality rate is found. CONCLUSIONS Increasing BMI, increasing age, male gender, pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure, and liver disease are risk factors for 30-day mortality after RYGB. The RYGB risk score can be used to determine patients at greater risk for mortality after RYGB surgery.","Benotti, Peter; Wood, G Craig; Winegar, Deborah A; Petrick, Anthony T; Still, Christopher D; Argyropoulos, George; Gerhard, Glenn S",Annals of surgery,72,1

Recently, there has been an increase of interest in its application thanks to increasing a new technology. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the evidence of the literature regarding the management of neurogenic dysphagia via telerehabilitation, compared to face-to-face rehabilitation treatment. The secondary aim was to create recommendations on telerehabilitation sessions for patients diagnosed with neurogenic dysphagia. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION The databases were: Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Scopus. A total of 235 records emerged from bibliographic research, manual search of full text and from gray literature, published until January 2021. Two blinded authors carried out titles and abstract screening and followed by full-text analysis. 16 articles were included in the systematic review and assessed through critical appraisal tools. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS The research shows that the majority of the studies on neurogenic dysphagia involved the Clinical Swallow Examination via telerehabilitation, compared with the inperson modality. Significant levels of agreement and high satisfaction from clinicians and patients are reported to support the use of telerehabilitation.

The aim of this study is to describe the experience at the Department of Pediatrics in the approach and the clinical outcomes of infected children. MATERIAL AND METHODS A descriptive observational study was performed. Children and adolescents (0 to 18 years) with SARS-CoV-2 infection, diagnosed in the emergency room or admitted to the Department of Pediatrics between March 11th and June 18th, were included. Hospital records and Trace COVID-19 platform were reviewed and patient caregivers were interviewed to assess follow up. RESULTS Among 103 diagnosed children, 83% had a known previous contact with an infected patient, 43% presented fever and 42% presented respiratory symptoms. Ten percent had risk factors and 21% were aged under one year old. Ten percent were hospitalised, one needing intensive care, with paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome. Blood tests were performed in 9% and chest radiograph in 7%. No children required ventilation, antiviral therapy or underwent thoracic computed tomography scan. Eight percent of children returned to the emergency room and one child was hospitalised. The clinical outcome is known in 101 patients and is favourable in all. DISCUSSION Most children had an epidemiological link and little clinical repercussion, even during the first year of life. The expected mild severity in children justified the use of established clinical criteria and recommendations for similar conditions, regarding tests and hospitalizations. No antiviral treatments were given due to lack of evidence of its benefits. CONCLUSION This strategy contributed to a low consumption of hospital resources and proved safe in this series.","Picão de Carvalho, Clara; Castro, Carolina; Sampaio Graça, Isabel; Lorenzo, Cristina; Barbosa Rodrigues, Ana; Inácio, Rafael; Prata, Filipa; Mouzinho, Ana; Pinto, Sara; Marques, José Gonçalo",Acta medica portuguesa,72,16

Lately, the anti-viral effects of macrolides have attracted considerable attention. Very recently, hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin treatment was reported to be effective for COVID-19. We believe that treatments with macrolides alone or in combination with other drugs are promising and open the possibility of an international strategy to fight this emerging viral infection.","Ohe, Masashi; Shida, Haruki; Jodo, Satoshi; Kusunoki, Yoshihiro; Seki, Masahide; Furuya, Ken; Goudarzi, Houman",Bioscience trends,72,24

In the first half of 2016, the Asian continent showed the fastest growth in the number of tourists. Such increase is seen due to the interest in Asian history, culture, and cuisine. In the globalizing world, human mobility causes changes in the epidemiology of diseases and the spread of various infections across continents. Parasitic infections that may pose a risk for travellers to the Asia-Pacific are malaria, leishmaniasis, filariasis, foodborne trematode infections, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted infections, and tourist diarrhea. Consulting a travel medical expert and using health services such as pre-travel vaccination and chemoprophylaxis will reduce the risk of infectious diseases among travelers.","Akdur Öztürk, Eylem; Ünver, Ayşegül",Turkiye parazitolojii dergisi,72,31

Amongst younger Irish women, smoking rates are considerably higher in those from socially disadvantaged areas compared to women from affluent areas. Women from poorer areas also experience higher rates of lung cancer. To our knowledge, there are no peer reviewed published systematic reviews on the effectiveness of interventions tailored to reduce smoking rates in women from disadvantaged areas. This systematic review protocol will aim to examine the effectiveness of such interventions and to describe trial processes such as recruitment, follow-up and dropout prevention strategies, as well as barriers and enablers of successful implementation. A systematic review will be conducted of peer-reviewed randomised controlled trials and associated process evaluations of smoking cessation interventions designed for women living in socially disadvantaged areas. If the search returns, less than five studies are review criteria will expand to include quasi-experimental studies. A number of databases of scholarly literature will be searched from inception using a detailed search strategy. Two independent reviewers will screen titles, abstracts and full-text articles to identify relevant studies using a pre-defined checklist based on PICOS. In the case of disagreement, a third reviewer will be consulted. The quality of included studies will be assessed using the 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation' (GRADE) criteria. Quantitative data will be extracted and, if comparable, will be assessed using meta-analysis. A narrative meta-synthesis of qualitative data will be conducted. This review aims to synthesise information from relevant studies on smoking cessation interventions tailored for women from socially disadvantaged areas.

RESULTS The authors discuss the surgical nuances of en bloc resection of high cervical tumors and explain their technique for lateral mass cage placement. Additionally, they provide their rationale for the use of these constructs throughout the craniocervical junction and subaxial spine.

Post Pregnancy Family Planning Choices, an operations research study, aims to examine the effectiveness of a package of postpregnancy FP interventions, inclusive of postpartum and postabortion FP. The interventions are being implemented in selected public and private facilities in Indonesia and Kenya and focus on quality FP counseling and service provision prior to discharge. This manuscript presents the study protocol, documenting how the study team intends to determine key factors that influence uptake of postpregnancy FP. Methods: This is a multi-country, quasi-experimental operations research study in Brebes and Batang Districts of Indonesia and Meru and Kilifi Counties of Kenya. Quantitative and qualitative data is collected from multiple data sources and participants through interviews and assessments at multiple time points. Participants include health facilities; antenatal, postpartum, and postabortion clients; and key informants at national, subnational, facility, and community levels. Quantitative study data is collected and managed through the use of REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). Once data are thoroughly cleaned and reviewed, regression models and multilevel analyses will explore quantitative data. Qualitative study data is collected using audio recordings and transcribed to Microsoft Word, then analyzed using ATLAS.ti. Qualitative datasets will be analyzed using grounded theory methods. Discussion: The ultimate goals of the study are to generate and disseminate actionable evidence of positive drivers, barriers, and activities that do not yield results with regard to increasing postpregnancy FP programmatic activities, and to institutionalize postpregnancy FP in the public and private sectors in Indonesia and Kenya. We hope these learnings and experience will contribute to global efforts to advance and scale up postpregnancy FP in similar settings beyond these two countries.

We aimed to explore health-related quality of life (QoL) in patients with haematological diseases during the early phase of the pandemic and their acceptability of using telehealth. PATIENTS AND METHODS We performed a cross-sectional survey among patients at the Department of Haematology, Odense University Hospital, Denmark. Eligible participants were patients receiving either active treatment or survivors in a follow-up program. The survey was open from 22 May to 13 June 2020. The survey contained questions on concerns and the impact of COVID-19 and acceptability on telehealth in addition to the assessment of health-related QoL. The later was assessed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer core QoL (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaire with the subdomains Global QoL, emotional functioning (EF) and social functioning (SF) being of primary interest. Further, anxiety during COVID-19 was assessed by use of an adapted version of the generalised anxiety disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire. RESULTS 4420 patients were eligible to participate. The response rate was 53% (n = 2239) of which 37% where in a treatment program and 63% where in a follow-up program. The majority (80%) of patients were concerned about contracting COVID-19. The global QoL score (69.0, ±SD 22.6) was markedly lower than EF (84.5, ±SD 18.9) and SF (85.0, ±SD 23.4). Regression analysis showed that being concerned (a little, moderately, very, extremely) about contracting COVID-19 correlated with lower scores of global QoL (-3.86 to -22.76), EF (-3.81 to -26.41) and SF (-1.14 to -22.49). The GAD-7 score showed that approximately 20% of patients had symptoms of COVID-19 associated generalised anxiety. Finally, 67% of the patients were positive towards replacing face-to-face consultancies with phone calls, but video consultations were less preferred (47%). CONCLUSION Danish patients with haematological cancer presented with low global QoL during the early phase of COVID-19, and 20% of the patients showed symptoms of generalised anxiety. Patients were overall positive towards the implementation of telehealth consultancies.","Ellehuus, Charlotte; Jeppesen, Stefan Starup; Eckhoff, Lise; Vestergaard, Hanne; Therkildsen, Ditte Naundrup; Frederiksen, Henrik; Eshoj, Henrik Rode",Acta oncologica,72,20

Outbreak response measures also have immediate and long-term gendered effects. However, gender-based analysis of outbreaks and responses is limited by lack of data and little integration of feminist analysis within global health scholarship. Recognising these barriers, this paper applies a gender matrix methodology, grounded in feminist political economy approaches, to evaluate the gendered effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and response in four case studies: China, Hong Kong, Canada, and the UK. Through a rapid scoping of documentation of the gendered effects of the outbreak, it applies the matrix framework to analyse findings, identifying common themes across the case studies: financial discrimination, crisis in care, and unequal risks and secondary effects. Results point to transnational structural conditions which put women on the front lines of the pandemic at work and at home while denying them health, economic and personal security - effects that are exacerbated where racism and other forms of discrimination intersect with gender inequities. Given that women and people living at the intersections of multiple inequities are made additionally vulnerable by pandemic responses, intersectional feminist responses should be prioritised at the beginning of any crises.","Smith, Julia; Davies, Sara E; Feng, Huiyun; Gan, Connie C R; Grépin, Karen A; Harman, Sophie; Herten-Crabb, Asha; Morgan, Rosemary; Vandan, Nimisha; Wenham, Clare",Global public health,72,17

Understanding the underlying analgesic mechanisms requires animal models. The aim of the current study was to develop an animal model for the analgesic actions of LVVA-SM in the setting of peripheral neuropathic pain. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rat sciatic nerve tibial and common peroneal branches were transected, sparing the sural branch (spared nerve injury, SNI). After 15-18 days, rats were assigned randomly to one of three groups (n=9 each group): LVVA-SM at 0.15-or 0.16-Hz or Control. LVVA-SM (20° flexion at the L5 vertebra with an innovative motorized treatment table) was administered in anesthetized rats for 10 min. Control rats were administered anesthesia and positioned on the treatment table. After 10, 25, and 40 min, the plantar skin of the hindpaw ipsilateral to SNI was tested for mechanical sensitivity (paw withdrawal threshold to a logarithmic series of Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments) and cold sensitivity (duration of paw lifting, shaking, and/or licking to topical acetone application). SNI produced behavioral signs of mechanical and cold allodynia. LVVA-SM reduced mechanical, but not cold, hypersensitivity compared with Control (0.15-Hz: P=0.04 at 10 min; 0.16-Hz: P<0.001 at 10 min, P=0.04 at 25 min).

Pediatric emergency departments (PED) play a pivotal role in the identification, treatment, and coordination of care for children with mental health disorders, however, there is a dearth of literature evaluating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health care provision in the PED. OBJECTIVES We sought to evaluate whether changes in frequency or patient demographics among children and adolescents presenting to the PED has occurred. METHODS This is a cross-sectional study conducted at the Yale New Haven Children's Hospital (YNHCH) PED. Data representing the early COVID-19 pandemic period was abstracted from the electronic medical record and compared using descriptive statistics to the same time period the year prior. Patient demographics including patient gender, ED disposition, mode of arrival, race-ethnicity, and insurance status were assessed. RESULTS During the pandemic period, 148 patients presented to the YNHCH PED with mental health-related diagnoses, compared to 378 in the pre-pandemic period, a reduction of 60.84%. Compared to white children, black children were 0.55 less likely to present with a mental health condition as compared to the pre-pandemic study period (p = 0.002; 95% CI 0.36-0.85). CONCLUSIONS Children with mental and behavioral health disorders who seek care in PEDs may be at risk for delayed presentations of mental health disorders.

In the present study, we change the approach to ask which technique is best for the individual patient`s risk profile. For this, two criteria are important: does the patient need reconstruction of the abdominal wall? or does he or she need treatment of symptoms without being exposed to unnecessarily high perioperative risks? METHODS In a heuristic selection procedure, 486 consecutive patients were classified according to their characteristics as low-risk or high-risk for postoperative complications. Low-risk patients preferentially underwent open abdominal wall reconstruction with mesh (MFR + mesh), high-risk patients mainly a bridging-mesh procedure, either by laparoscopic (Lap.-IPOM) or open approach (Open-IPOM). Primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative complications. Secondary outcome was the recurrence-free interval. The propensity score was used for covariate adjustment analyzing recurrence rate as well as postoperative complications using Cox regression and logistic regression, respectively. RESULTS Comparison of all surgical procedures showed risk factors had no independent influence on occurrence of complications (p = 0.110). Hernial gap width was an independent factor for occurrence of complications (p = 0.002). Propensity score adjustment revealed Lap.-IPOM to have a significantly higher recurrence rate than MFR + mesh (HR 2.367, 95% CI 1.123-4.957, p = 0.024). Three or more risk factors were protective against recurrence (HR 0.454, 95% CI 0.221-0.924, p = 0.030). In the univariate Cox regression analysis for recurrence, age >50 years was a protective prognostic factor (HR 0.412, 95% CI 0.245-0.702, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS The classification criteria applied were internally validated. The heuristic algorithm ensured that patients at high-risk of complications did not have a higher perioperative complication rate than patients at low-risk.","Dietz, U A; Fleischhacker, A; Menzel, S; Klinge, U; Jurowich, C; Haas, K; Heuschmann, P; Germer, C-T; Wiegering, A",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,72,29

This case-control study utilized data from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan. Controls visited the emergency department of the same hospital for trauma or fractures (excluding burns) and used allopurinol, carbamazepine or phenytoin during the past 3 months. We determined whether patients were prescribed a combination of drugs in addition to allopurinol, carbamazepine or phenytoin within the last 3 months. We identified 1 853 985 controls and 7327 SJS-diagnosed patients using the Taiwan NHIRD records for 2000-2008. Higher use of allopurinol (49.8%), carbamazepine (39.1%) or phenytoin (21.3%) was observed among patients (n = 3131) than among controls (n = 2858). The overall SJS incidence rate was 3.6/1 000 000. Drug combinations were uncommon (<10%) in patients or controls taking allopurinol. However, combination drug use exceeded 10% in patients taking carbamazepine or phenytoin. Logistic regression analysis of recent combination drug use revealed that phenobarbital, valproate, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including piroxicam and tenoxicam, and antibiotics including amoxicillin and cephalexin were strongly associated with SJS. Patients with gout or epilepsy taking allopurinol, carbamazepine or phenytoin should be evaluated carefully by physicians. Concurrent use of piroxicam, tenoxicam, phenobarbital, valproate, amoxicillin or cephalexin, in addition to carbamazepine or phenytoin, may increase the incidence of SJS.","Syu, Fei-Kai; Pan, Hsiu-Yung; Chuang, Po-Chun; Huang, Yi-Syun; Cheng, Chi-Yung; Cheng, Fu-Jen",The Journal of dermatology,72,1

RECENT FINDINGS A recent study described comprehensively the pathology of grey matter lesions in early MS. In this study, cortical demyelination together with inflammation was frequently observed in early MS cases. This study and others serve as a basis for a model of the development of cortical MS lesions in which several consecutive events may be involved. After the activation of T cells, which may open the blood-brain barrier, the humoral immune system may mediate the inflammatory process. The inflammation may become chronic through the involvement of activated glial cells and the persistence of immune cells in the meninges.Apart from MS, other grey matter CNS disorders exist in which antibodies against neuronal structures contribute to pathophysiological events such as in limbic encephalitis. Humoral and adaptive immunity mediates the pathophysiology of Rasmussen encephalitis. SUMMARY This review focuses on the difference between inflammatory grey matter and white matter lesions. New insights into inflammatory grey matter lesions in MS and other CNS inflammatory processes such as limbic encephalitis are discussed.","Junker, Andreas; Brück, Wolfgang",Current opinion in neurology,72,1

Moreover, it increases patients' satisfaction with the surgery. In this study, we present a simple approach involving the safe placement of intercostal catheter (ICC) after single port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) anatomic resection and we evaluate postoperative analgesic function with and without it. METHODS We identified patients who underwent single port anatomic resection with ICC placed intraoperatively as a route for continuous postoperative levobupivacaine (0.5%) administration and retrospectively compared them with a group of single port anatomic resection patients without ICC. The operation time, postoperative day 0, 1, 2, 3 and discharge day pain score, triflow numbers, narcotic requirements, drainage duration and post-operative hospital stay were compared. RESULTS In total, 78 patients were enrolled in the final analysis (39 patients with ICC and 39 without). We found patients with ICC had less pain sensation numerical rating scale (NRS) on postoperative day 0, 1 (P=0.023, <0.001) and better triflow performance on postoperative day 1 and 2 (P=0.015, 0.032). In addition, lower IV form morphine usage frequency and dosage (P=0.009, 0.017), shorter chest tube drainage duration (P=0.001) and postoperative stay (P=0.005) were observed in the ICC group. CONCLUSIONS Continuous intercostal nerve blockade by placing an ICC intraoperatively provides effective analgesia for patients undergoing single port VATS anatomic resection. This may be considered a viable alternative for postoperative pain management.","Hsieh, Ming-Ju; Wang, Kuo-Cheng; Liu, Hung-Pin; Gonzalez-Rivas, Diego; Wu, Ching-Yang; Liu, Yun-Hen; Wu, Yi-Cheng; Chao, Yin-Kai; Wu, Ching-Feng",Journal of thoracic disease,72,31

METHOD Six weeks after the beginning of the confinement period, an online 10- question survey was sent to all members of the Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacists. A single response per hospital was requested. The survey included questions on the provision of remote pharmaceutical care prior to the onset of the health crisis, patient selection criteria, procedures for home delivery of medications and the means used to deliver them, the number of patients who benefited from telepharmacy, and the number of referrals made. Finally, respondents were asked whether a teleconsultation was carried out before sending patients their medication and whether these deliveries were recorded. RESULTS A total of 39.3% (n = 185) of all the hospitals in the National Health System (covering all of Spain's autonomous regions) responded to the survey. Before the beginning of the crisis, 83.2% (n = 154) of hospital pharmacy services did not carry out remote pharmaceutical care activities that included telepharmacy with remote delivery of medication. During the study period, 119,972 patients were treated, with 134,142 deliveries of medication being completed. Most hospitals did not use patient selection criteria. A total of 30.2% of hospitals selected patients based on their personal circumstances. Home delivery and informed delivery (87%; 116,129 deliveries) was the option used in most cases. The means used to deliver the medication mainly included the use of external courier services (47.0%; 87 hospitals) or the hospital's own transport services (38.4%; 71 hospitals). As many as 87.6% of hospitals carried out teleconsultations prior to sending out medications and 59.6% recorded their telepharmacy activities in the hospital pharmacy appointments record. CONCLUSIONS The rate of implementation of telepharmacy in outpatient care in Spain during the study period in the pandemic was high. This made it possible to guarantee the continuity of care for a large number of patients.","Tortajada-Goitia, Begoña; Morillo-Verdugo, Ramón; Margusino-Framiñán, Luis; Marcos, José Antonio; Fernández-Llamazares, Cecilia M",Farmacia hospitalaria : organo oficial de expresion cientifica de la Sociedad Espanola de Farmacia Hospitalaria,72,27

Standard treatment has included surgical resection, radiation, chemotherapy, and, in the case of neuroblastoma, immunotherapy. Despite such intensive therapy, cancer recurrence is common, and most tumors become refractory to prior therapy, leaving patients with few conventional treatment options. Natural killer (NK) cells are non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted lymphocytes that boast several complex killing mechanisms but at an added advantage of not causing graft-versus-host disease, making use of allogeneic NK cells a potential therapeutic option. On top of their killing capacity, NK cells also produce several cytokines and growth factors that act as key regulators of the adaptive immune system, positioning themselves as ideal effector cells for stimulating heavily pretreated immune systems. Despite this promise, clinical efficacy of adoptive NK cell therapy to date has been inconsistent, prompting a detailed understanding of the biological pathways within NK cells that can be leveraged to develop ""next generation"" NK cell therapies. Here, we review advances in current approaches to optimizing the NK cell antitumor response including combination with other immunotherapies, cytokines, checkpoint inhibition, and engineering NK cells with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) for the treatment of pediatric solid tumors.","Quamine, Aicha E; Olsen, Mallery R; Cho, Monica M; Capitini, Christian M",Cancers,72,19

The aim of this study was to compare different drain types with regard to abdominal complication rates. METHODS All consecutive full-size orthotopic liver transplantations (LTX) performed over a 7-year period were included in this retrospective analysis. Abdominal drain groups were divided into open-circuit drains and closed-circuit drains. Data are reported as total number (%) or median (range); for all comparisons a p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS A total of 256 LTX [age 56.89 (0.30-75.21) years; MELD 14.5 (7-40)] was included; 56 (21.8 %) patients received an open-circuit Easy Flow Drain (Group 1) and 200 (78.2 %) a closed-circuit Robinson Drainage System (Group 2).

A variety of improvements in probe design and experimental conditions have brought this technology to the point that single-nucleotide differences can be efficiently detected in unmixed samples, although developing reliable methods for detection of mixed sequences (e.g., heterozygotes) remains challenging. Surprisingly, a comprehensive study of the probe design parameters and experimental conditions that optimize discrimination of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has yet to be reported, so the limits of this technology remain uncertain. By targeting 24,549 SNPs that differ between two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, we studied the effect of SNPs on hybridization efficiency to DNA microarray probes of different lengths under different hybridization conditions. We found that the critical parameter for optimization of sequence discrimination is the relationship between probe melting temperature (T(m)) and the temperature at which the hybridization reaction is performed. This relationship can be exploited through the design of microarrays containing probes of equal T(m) by varying the length of probes. We demonstrate using such a microarray that we detect >90% homozygous SNPs and >80% heterozygous SNPs using the SNPScanner algorithm. The optimized design and experimental parameters determined in this study should guide DNA microarray designs for applications that require sequence discrimination such as mutation detection, genotyping of unmixed and mixed samples, and allele-specific gene expression. Moreover, designing microarray probes with optimized sensitivity to mismatches should increase the accuracy of standard microarray applications such as copy-number variation detection and gene expression analysis.","Gresham, David; Curry, Bo; Ward, Alexandra; Gordon, D Benjamin; Brizuela, Leonardo; Kruglyak, Leonid; Botstein, David",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,72,19

AIM To assess the efficacy of colonoscopy, capsule, enema, and nasogastric tube (NGT) FMT for the treatment of recurrent CDI. METHODS We reported clinical outcomes of colonoscopy, capsule, enema, and NGT FMT for the treatment of recurrent CDI according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. During January 2000 to January 2018, three databases were searched: PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL. Primary outcome was overall cure rate which was assessed using a random effects model; secondary outcomes included adverse effects as well as subgroup analyses comparing donor relationship, sample preparation, and study design. RESULTS Twenty-six studies (1309 patients) were included in the study. FMT was administered using colonoscopy in 16 studies (483 patients), NGT in five studies (149 patients), enema in four studies (360 patients), and capsules in four studies (301 patients). The random effects of pooled FMT cure rates were colonoscopy 94.8% (CI 92.4-96.8%; I2 15.6%), capsule 92.1% (CI 88.6-95.0%; I2 7.1%), enema 87.2% (CI 83.4-90.5%; I2 0%), and NGT/NDT 78.1% (CI 71.6-84.1%; I2 0%). On subgroup analysis of colonoscopy FMT, sample preparation methods had comparable cure rates: fresh 94.9% compared to 94.5%. Similarly, cure rates were unaffected by donor relationship: mixed 94.5% compared to unrelated donor 95.7%. CONCLUSION CDI cure rates with FMT performed with colonoscopy are superior to enema and NGT FMT, while those with FMT with colonoscopy and capsule are comparable.","Ramai, Daryl; Zakhia, Karl; Fields, Paul J; Ofosu, Andrew; Patel, Goonja; Shahnazarian, Vahe; Lai, Jonathan K; Dhaliwal, Amaninder; Reddy, Madhavi; Chang, Shannon",Digestive diseases and sciences,72,1

The pathogenesis of H5N1 viral infection is associated with the ability of the virus to induce apoptotic cell death. However, the molecular mechanism of apoptosis induced by H5N1 remains unclear. In the present study we demonstrate that H5N1 virus is able to up-regulate the expression of gene associated with retinoid and interferon induced mortality-19 (GRIM-19) in human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs). GRIM-19 has been identified as a novel gene with apoptotic effects in virus-infected cells. The percentage of apoptotic cells is significantly decreased in H5N1-infected GRIM-19 depleted hMDMs, which is also associated with a decrease of BH3-interacting domain death agonist cleavage and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) release to the cytosol. These results suggested the involvement of GRIM-19 in apoptosis induced by H5N1 virus. Furthermore, neutralizing-IFN-β Ab is able to suppress GRIM-19 expression in H5N1-infected cells resulting in a decrease in apoptotic cell number, indicating that IFN-β secreted by H5N1-infected hMDMs regulates GRIM-19 expression leading to apoptosis. Altogether, the results presented here provide additional insight on the regulatory mechanism of H5N1 viral-induced apoptotic cell death in hMDMs.","Ekchariyawat, Peeraya; Thitithanyanont, Arunee; Sirisinha, Stitaya; Utaisincharoen, Pongsak",Innate immunity,72,31

Immediate infusion reactions can occur with any IV iron and are usually mild; severe reactions - particularly anaphylaxis - are extremely rare. The recognition and appropriate management of infusion reactions is an important consideration to the successful administration of IV iron. Severe, persistent, hypophosphatemia is a specific side effect of FCM. No cardiovascular safety signal has been identified for IV iron.

However, AF can be paroxysmal and asymptomatic, thereby making detection with routine ECG methods difficult. Oral anticoagulation is highly effective in reducing recurrent stroke in patients with AF, but its initiation is dependent on the detection of AF. Cryptogenic Stroke and Underlying Atrial Fibrillation (CRYSTAL AF) is the first randomized study to report the detection of AF in cryptogenic stroke patients using continuous long-term monitoring via insertable cardiac monitors (ICM). METHODS AND RESULTS Patients with prior cryptogenic stroke were randomized to control (n=220) or ICM (n=221) and followed for ≤36 months. Cumulative AF detection rates in the ICM arm increased progressively during this period (3.7%, 8.9%, 12.4%, and 30.0% at 1, 6, 12, and 36 months, respectively), but remained low in the control arm (3.0% at 36 months). This resulted in oral anticoagulation prescription in 94.7% of ICM patients with AF detected at 6 months, 96.6% at 12 months, and 90.5% at 36 months. Among ICM patients with AF detected, the median time to AF detection was 8.4 months, 81.0% of first AF episodes were asymptomatic, and 94.9% had at least 1 day with >6 minutes of AF. CONCLUSIONS Three-year monitoring by ICM in cryptogenic stroke patients demonstrated a significantly higher AF detection rate compared with routine care. Given the frequency of asymptomatic first episodes and the long median time to detection, these findings highlight the limitations of using traditional AF detection methods. The majority of patients with AF were prescribed oral anticoagulation therapy.

METHODS This report is a sub-analysis of a larger qualitative study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with PWID admitted to an academic medical center from 2017 to 2020 for an invasive injection-related infection. Standard qualitative analysis techniques, consisting of both inductive and deductive approaches, were used to identify and characterize the effects of COVID-19 on participants. RESULTS Among the 30 PWID interview participants, 14 reported barriers to accessing health and addiction services due to COVID-19. As facilities decreased appointment availability or transitioned to telemedicine, PWID reported being unable to access services. Social distancing led to isolation or loneliness during hospital stays and in the community. Recovery meetings and support groups, critical to addiction recovery, were particularly affected. Other participants reported that uncertainty and fear of contracting the virus generated changes in behavior that led them to avoid seeking services. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 has disrupted health systems and social services, leading PWID to experience unprecedented barriers to accessing and maintaining health and addiction services in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Opioid use disorder management must be understood as a holistic process, and a multidisciplinary approach to ensuring comprehensive care, even in the midst of this pandemic, is needed.","Gleason, Emily; Nolan, Nathanial S; Marks, Laura R; Habrock, Tracey; Liang, Stephen Y; Durkin, Michael J",Journal of addiction medicine,72,19

Food insecurity, which entails having limited or uncertain access to a sufficient quantity of nutritious food, is a key pandemic-related consequence. We examined how people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) have been affected by the pandemic, particularly Black participants and participants residing in food deserts. METHODS Using survey data from a longitudinal cohort study of predominantly Black low-income adults aged ≥18 residing in urban food deserts in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we examined changes in food insecurity and SNAP participation before COVID-19 (2018) and early in the COVID-19 pandemic (March-May 2020). We modeled changes in food insecurity from 2018 to 2020 via covariate-adjusted logistic regression. RESULTS Food insecurity increased significantly among participants enrolled in SNAP and surveyed in both 2018 and 2020 (from 25.9% in 2018 to 46.9% in 2020; P < .001). Compared with cohort participants not enrolled in SNAP at both points, cohort participants enrolled in SNAP in 2018 and 2020 had the highest rates of using a food bank in 2020 (44.4%) and being newly food insecure in 2020 (28.9%) (ie, they were food insecure in 2020 but not in 2018). CONCLUSIONS Food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic increased among low-income Black households enrolled in SNAP and residing in a food desert. Public health recovery efforts might focus on modifying SNAP to improve the food security of people experiencing poverty.","Siddiqi, Sameer M; Cantor, Jonathan; Dastidar, Madhumita Ghosh; Beckman, Robin; Richardson, Andrea S; Baird, Matthew D; Dubowitz, Tamara",Public health reports,72,1

BACKGROUND Disasters are often sudden and uncertain. Since the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan city, local frontline nurses had been responsible for treatment of COVID-19 for several months. Qualitative study was required to assess complex multi-component psychological experiences among frontline nurses. METHODS 20 local frontline nurses were recruited from a designated hospital of COVID-19 treatment. We conducted semi-structured interview using phenomenological method. Descriptive phenomenological method was applied for thematic analysis. RESULTS 20 female front-line nurses (aged 24 to 43 years old) were interviewed. Two broader themes, negative and positive, were identified. Negative experience included refusal and helpless (refusal to work at frontline, shortage of confidence in working and helpless), fear and anxiety, excessive miss, and other health issues. Positive experience included improved interpersonal relationship, sublimation of personal faith and strength, changes in understanding meaning of life and new possibility. CONCLUSION Both positive and negative psychological response were observed, which can provide evidence based clues for making essential strategies and policy. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT Understand subjective experience of frontline nurses can establish evidence for development of effective psychological intervention. Nursing administrator should consider the nurses' psychological experience comprehensively to promote psychological growth and lower post-traumatic psychological burden.","Peng, Xin; Yang, Yi; Gao, Ping; Ren, Yi; Hu, Deying; He, Qin",Journal of nursing management,72,28

DESIGN All 23 participants who volunteered for this study were randomly divided into static (n = 12) and control (n = 11) groups. The subjects in the static stretching group performed stretching exercises for the ankle evertor and dorsiflexor muscles 5 days a week for 6 wks. Peroneal and tibialis anterior muscle reaction characteristics were evaluated at the beginning (2 times for acute effect) and end of this period. Electromyographic activity parameters of the muscles were measured using an ankle inversion tilting platform that simulated a sudden ankle inversion. The following were the four different ankle inversion conditions: (a) ankle-neutral, 15-degree inversion; (b) ankle-neutral, 30-degree inversion; (c) ankle-20-degree plantarflexion, 15-degree inversion; and (d) ankle-20-degree plantarflexion, 30-degree inversion. RESULTS Either in terms of acute or chronic effects, no significant differences were found after static stretching exercises for peroneal and tibialis anterior muscle reaction time, reaction duration, and muscle activity evaluated in four positions on the ankle inversion simulation platform (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS In light of these results, it is possible to state that the short duration of static stretching exercises can still be applied before sports activities.","Sekir, Ufuk; Arslan, Gufat; Ilhan, Osman; Akova, Bedrettin",American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,72,30

Wuhan, Hubei Province, is the origin and core location of the epidemic. Neurosurgeons were faced with the challenge of balancing treatment of patients with life-threatening conditions and preventing the cross-transmission of the virus. Methods: A series of infection prevention and control strategies was adopted for the peri-operative period of emergency surgeries in our department. These strategies include protective measures for the emergency department (ED) and measures for the peri-operative period of emergency surgery. The propensity score matching (PSM) was used to match COVID-19-related patients with patients before the epidemic. Length of wait time in the ED and duration of operation were compared. Results: From January 23, 2020 to March 18, 2020, we performed emergency surgery for 19 patients who were either COVID-19-related or COVID-19-suspected. None of the medical staff involved in the surgeries developed viral infection, and no peri-operative virus transmission occurred in our hospital. After the PSM, 32 patients were included in the epidemic group and the pre-epidemic group (16 patients in each group). The duration of wait time in the ED of the former group was longer than that of the latter group (z = -3.000; p = 0.003). During the epidemic, the duration of a craniotomy was longer than before the epidemic (z = -2.253; p = 0.024), and there was no difference in the duration of interventional surgery (z = -0.314; p = 0.753). Conclusion: We believe that our experience can provide a useful reference for other surgeons facing the same challenges and as a lesson for similar infectious diseases that may occur in the future.","Chen, Aobo; Song, Jian; Xu, Guozheng; Guan, Jiangheng; Xie, Tianhao",Surgical infections,72,31

Massive demands of G. lucidum have fascinated the researchers towards its application as functional food, nutraceutical and modern medicine owing to wide range of application in various diseases include immunomodulators, anticancer, antiviral, antioxidant, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective. G. lucidum polysaccharides exhibit immunomodulatory properties through boosting the action of antigen-presenting cells, mononuclear phagocyte system, along with humoral and cellular immunity. β-Glucans isolated from G. lucidum are anticipated to produce an immune response through pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). β-Glucans after binding with dectin-1 receptor present on different cells include macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells and neutrophils produce signal transduction that lead to trigger the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), T cells and Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) that refer to cytokines production and contributing to immune response. While triterpenoids produce antiviral effects through inhibiting various enzymes like neuraminidase, HIV-protease, DENV2 NS2B-NS3 protease and HSV multiplication.

All efforts to contain the pathogenesis either using inhibitory drugs or vaccines largelyremained futile due to a lack of better understanding of the genomic feature of this virus. In thepresent study, we compared the 2019-nCoV with other coronaviruses, which indicated that batSARS like coronavirus could be a probable ancestor of the novel coronavirus. The proteinsequence similarity of pangolin-hCoV and bat-hCoV with human coronavirus was higher ascompared to their nucleotide similarity denoting the occurrence of more synonymous mutationsin the genome. Phylogenetic and alignment analysis of 591 novel coronaviruses of differentclades from Group I to Group V revealed several mutations and concomitant amino acidchanges. Detailed investigation on nucleotide substitution unfolded 100 substitutions in thecoding region of which 43 were synonymous and 57 were of non-synonymous type. The nonsynonymous substitutions resulting into 57 amino acid changes were found to be distributed overdifferent hCoV proteins with maximum on spike protein. An important di-amino acid change RGto KR was observed in ORF9 protein. Additionally, several interesting features of the novelcoronavirus genome have been highlighted in respect to various other human infecting viruseswhich may explain extreme pathogenicity, infectivity and simultaneously the reason behindfailure of the antiviral therapies. SUMMARY: This study presents a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV2 isolates to understand discrete mutations that are occurring between patient samples. The analysis unravel various amino acid mutations in the viral proteins which may provide an explanation for varying treatment efficacies of different inhibitory drugs and a future direction towards a combinatorial treatment therapies based on the kind of mutation in the viral genome.","Tiwari, Manish; Mishra, Divya",Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,72,20

Although several standardized handoff strategies have been developed, their sustainability remains is poor. Little is known regarding factors that impede handoff standardization. PURPOSE Our objectives are three-fold: (1) highlight compliance failures with standardized handoffs; (2) identify factors contributing to compliance failures; and (3) develop guidelines for sustainable handoff interventions and processes. METHODS We used ethnographic data collection methods-general observations, handoff shadowing, and semi-structured clinician interviews-with 84 participants from OR, ICU, and telemedicine teams at a large academic medical center. We conducted thematic analysis supported by inductive and deductive coding using the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) framework. RESULTS Post-operative handoffs can be characterized into four phases: pre-transfer preparation, transfer and setup, report preparation and delivery, and post-transfer care. We identified compliance failures with standardized handoff protocols and associated risk factors within the OR-ICU work system including limited teamwork, absence of handoff-specific tools, and poor clinician buy-in. To improve handoffs, clinicians provided suggestions for developing collaborative Electronic Health Record (EHR)-integrated handoff tools and re-engineering the handoff process. CONCLUSIONS Compliance failures are prevalent in all handoff phases, leading to poor adherence with standardization. We propose theoretically grounded guidelines for designing ""flexibly standardized"" bundled handoff interventions for ensuring care continuity in OR to ICU transitions of care.","Abraham, Joanna; Meng, Alicia; Sona, Carrie; Wildes, Troy; Avidan, Michael; Kannampallil, Thomas",International journal of medical informatics,72,1

PHOSPHATE-TRANSPORTER 1 (PHT1) and its regulator PHOSPHATE-STARVATION-RESPONSE 1 (PHR1), which comprise the PHR1-PHT1 module, play important roles in maintaining Pi homeostasis in different organs. However, the PHR1-PHT1 module and its functions in nodules remain unknown. We identified one PHT1 (GmPHT1;11) and four PHR1 (GmPHR1) homologs in soybean (Glycine max) plants, which displayed specific expression patterns in different tissues in nodules, similar to previously reported GmPHT1;1 and GmPHT1;4. Through the integration of different approaches, GmPHR-GmPHT1 modules were confirmed. Combining our results and previous reports, we established multiple GmPHR-GmPHT1 modules acting in the infected or non-infected tissues in nodules. A single GmPHR had more than one GmPHT1 target, and vice versa. Therefore, overlapping and cross-talking modules monitored the wave of available Pi to maintain Pi homeostasis in nodules, which sequentially regulated nodule initiation and development. High levels of GmPHT1;11 enhanced Pi accumulation in nodules, increased nodule size, but decreased nodule number. Nitrogenase activity was also enhanced by GmPHT1;11.

Although preventive measures such as social distancing, personal protective equipment and isolation would decrease the spread of the infection, a definitive treatment is still under way. Antivirals, immunisation, convalescent plasma (CP) and many more modalities are under trial, and there has been no definite answer to the management of COVID-19 infection. All patients so far have received the standard and symptomatic care. It is shown that the SARS-CoV 2 is a respiratory pathogen, and 80% of the infected patients would recover from the illness and it is the 20% of the infected patients require hospitalisation and even critical care. CP has been used to treat recent epidemic respiratory infections such as Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infections with promising results. The CP of a recovered individual contains antibodies which neutralise the virus and decrease the viral replication in the patient. It is a classic adaptive immunotherapy and has been applied in the prevention and treatment of many infectious diseases. CP is plasma taken from a person who has recovered from an infection, which contains neutralising antibodies against the said infection. Giving CP to susceptible individuals or infected patients is a form of passive antibody therapy and in the case of SARS-CoV-2, is expected to provide protection by viral neutralisation and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and phagocytosis. The adaptive response is to a specific antigen-binding array of molecules that are foreign to the host. The human response to viruses uses both the innate and the adaptive arms in its attempt to rid the host of the invading pathogen. The humoral response is a component of the adaptive immune response that allows for antibodies to bind to foreign invading pathogens, marks the pathogens and their toxins for phagocytosis and recruits further phagocytic cells to the site via the activation of the complement system and eventually prevents the pathogen from infecting target cells. Studies from Wuhan from various institutions during the research on COVID-19 infections during December 2019 have also shown promising results. Till date, randomised controlled studies for the use of CP in SARS-CoV-2 infection are lacking, and many countries have invited institutions to participate in clinical trials. The Indian Council of Medical research and the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, Government of India, have allowed the use of CP as an investigational drug under a trial basis. Internationally, agencies such as the USFDA, American Association of Blood Banks, European Blood Safety and British Blood Transfusion Society have also come out with various guidelines for the use of CP in COVID-19 infection.

Failing to enroll cohorts that reflect the pediatric population at large restricts the generalizability of such studies. In this investigation, we evaluate racial and ethnic minority representation among participants enrolled in BPCA-sponsored studies. METHODS Data were obtained for all participants enrolled in 33 federally funded studies of drugs and devices conducted from 2008 through June 2020. Observed racial and ethnic distributions were compared with expected distributions by sampling Census data at the same geographic frequency as in the studies. Racial and ethnic enrollment was examined by demography, geography, study type, study burden, and expected bias. Standard descriptive statistics, χ2, generalized linear models, and linear regression were applied. RESULTS A total of 10 918 participants (51% male, 6.6 ± 8.2 years) were enrolled across 46 US states and 4 countries. Studies ranged from treatment outcome reviews to randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Minority enrollment was comparable to, or higher than, expected (+0.1% to +2.6%) for all groups except Asian Americans (-3.7%, P < .001). American Indian and Alaskan Native and multiracial enrollment significantly increased over the evaluation period (P < .01). There were no significant differences in racial distribution as a function of age or sex, although differences were observed on the basis of geography, study type, and study burden.

External validity refers to how generalisable interventions are to populations or settings beyond those in the original study. The degree to which external validity elements are reported in such studies is unclear however. This systematic review aimed to determine the extent to which childhood obesity interventions delivered by health professionals during the first 1,000 days report on elements that can be used to inform generalizability across settings and populations. Methods: Eligible studies meeting study inclusion and exclusion criteria were identified through a systematic review of 11 databases and three trial registers. An assessment tool based on the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework was used to assess the external validity of included studies. It comprised five dimensions: reach and representativeness of individuals, reach and representativeness of settings, implementation and adaptation, outcomes for decision making maintenance and/or institutionalisation. Two authors independently assessed the external validity of 20% of included studies; discrepancies were resolved, and then one author completed assessments of the remaining studies. Results: In total, 39 trials involving 46 interventions published between 1999 and 2019 were identified. The majority of studies were randomized controlled trials (n=24). Reporting varied within and between dimensions. External validity elements that were poorly described included: representativeness of individuals and settings, treatment receipt, intervention mechanisms and moderators, cost effectiveness, and intervention sustainability and acceptability. Conclusions: Our review suggests that more emphasis is needed on research designs that consider generalisability, and the reporting of external validity elements in early life childhood obesity prevention interventions. Important gaps in external validity reporting were identified that could facilitate decisions around the translation and scale-up of interventions from research to practice.

DATA SOURCES We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis of 8 electronic databases for double-blind, randomized controlled trials of adjunctive pharmacotherapies for acute bipolar depression. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and applied the Cochrane risk of bias tool for study quality appraisal. Two reviewers independently abstracted data. We resolved all discrepancies by consensus. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were response and completion of treatment. We estimated summary rate ratios (RRs) and standardized mean differences (SMDs) relative to placebo controls using frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis. RESULTS We identified 69 trials meeting eligibility criteria (8,007 participants, 42.8 years, 58.0% female). Adjunctive racemic intravenous ketamine, coenzyme Q10, pramipexole, fluoxetine, and lamotrigine were more effective than placebo. Summary RRs for response ranged between 1.51 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11 to 2.06) for fluoxetine and 12.49 (95% CI, 3.06 to 50.93) for racemic intravenous ketamine. For completion of treatment, risperidone appeared less tolerable than placebo (RR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.94), while fluoxetine seemed more tolerable than placebo (RR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.24). None of the investigated agents were associated with increased treatment-emergent mood switches. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The evidence for augmentation strategies in bipolar depression is limited to a handful of agents. Fluoxetine appeared to have the most consistent evidence base for both efficacy and tolerability.

Through dissociation constant (Kd ) comparison, we found that the coronavirus N protein can bind to the poly(A) tail with high affinity, establishing N protein as a PABP. A subsequent analysis with UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation revealed that the N protein is able to bind to the poly(A) tail in infected cells. Further examination demonstrated that poly(A) tail binding by the N protein negatively regulates translation of coronaviral RNA and host mRNA both in vitro and in cells. Although the N protein can interact with PABP and eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), the poor interaction efficiency between the poly(A)-bound N protein and eIF4E may explain the observed decreased translation efficiency. In addition to interaction with translation factor eIF4G, the N protein is able to interact with coronavirus nonstructural protein 9 (nsp9), a replicase protein required for replication. The study demonstrates interactions among the poly(A) tail, N protein, and PABP both in vitro and in infected cells. Of the interactions, binding of the poly(A) tail to N protein decreases the interaction efficiency between the poly(A) tail and eIF4E, leading to translation inhibition. The poly(A)-dependent translation inhibition by N protein has not been previously demonstrated and thus extends our understanding of coronavirus gene expression.IMPORTANCE Gene expression in coronavirus is a complicated and dynamic process. In this study, we demonstrated that coronavirus N protein is able to bind to the poly(A) tail with high affinity, establishing N protein as a PABP. We also show how the interplay between coronavirus 3' poly(A) tail, PABP, and N protein regulates gene expression of the coronavirus and host cell. Of the interactions, poly(A) tail binding by the N protein negatively regulates translation, and to our knowledge, this inhibition of translation by binding of the N protein to poly(A) tail has not been previously studied. Accordingly, the study provides fundamental molecular details regarding coronavirus infection and expands our knowledge of coronavirus gene expression.","Tsai, Tsung-Lin; Lin, Ching-Houng; Lin, Chao-Nan; Lo, Chen-Yu; Wu, Hung-Yi",Journal of virology,72,1

Participants, 100 bereaved adults, from Pakistan and England, lost parents in the last 10 years. They completed three questionnaires. The study hypotheses were, first, that participants whose bereavement occurred more than five years ago would show significantly higher levels of post-traumatic growth. Second, participants with higher levels of post-traumatic growth would experience significantly higher grief scores. Thirdly, participants with higher levels of post-traumatic growth would show significantly higher levels of coping skills. Two hypotheses were rejected, only one received partial support. Yet, levels of post-traumatic growth were high in this sample. Post-traumatic growth does not follow every bereavement. The authors provide autoethnographic material to challenge this. Circumstances surrounding bereavement during the Covid-19 pandemic, are more likely to lead to increases in complicated grief reactions, rather than post-traumatic growth.","Qasim, Komal; Carson, Jerome",Omega,72,17

Our aim was to determine in term newborns any differences based on mode of delivery in either neuronal injury biomarkers, phosphorylated axonal neurofilament heavy chain (pNF-H) and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (UCHL1), or brain oxygenation values, regional cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (CrSO2) and cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (CFOE). METHODS An Institutional Review Board approved prospective observational pilot study of well newborns. Serum pNF-H and UCHL1 levels were measured on the day following delivery. CrSO2 values along with CFOE values were also measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and pulse oximetry. RESULTS There were 22 subjects, 15 born vaginally and seven born by cesarean section. No difference was found in mean pNF-H (107.9±54.3 pg/mL vs. 120.2±43.3 pg/mL, P=0.66) or mean UCHL1 (4.0±3.5 pg/mL vs. 3.0±2.2 pg/mL, P=0.68). No difference was found in mean CrSO2 (80.8±5.3% vs. 80.8±5.6%, P=0.99) or mean CFOE (0.17±0.06 vs. 0.15±0.08, P=0.51). CONCLUSIONS We found no difference in neuronal injury markers between term neonates born vaginally compared to those born by cesarean section. From a neurologic standpoint, this supports current obstetric practice guidelines that emphasize vaginal birth as the preferred delivery method whenever possible.","Morel, Alexandra Almanzar; Bailey, Sean M; Shaw, Gerry; Mally, Pradeep; Malhotra, Sunil P",Journal of perinatal medicine,72,31

A solution to this problem may be transmission; by modification of the transgene, the gene product can be secreted and internalized by the surrounding cells. Cancer gene therapy using the herpes simplex thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) suicide gene is a promising treatment, and TK has been used in clinical trials with some success. However, this kind of therapy has limited efficacy due to the low level of gene transfer reached. A modified TK protein, capable of migrating from the producing cell to neighboring cells, would result in a greater proportion of cells affected by the treatment. As a first step towards transmission, we constructed a secretory form of HSV-TK by including the Igkappa leader peptide in the gene. An endoplasmatic reticulum export signal was added to the construct to further improve its secretion. Secretion and protein production in cancer cells, the enzymatic activity of the modified proteins and the ability of the modified TK to sensitize cancer cells to ganciclovir were tested. Addition of the Igkappa leader resulted in high levels of secretion of HSV-TK, with up to 70% of the total amount of protein secreted. Inclusion of an ER export signal did not further improve secretion. The enzyme activity of the secreted TK however, was decreased when compared to native TK. This study is the first to report on secretion of TK, and provides a first step in a novel strategy to improve the efficiency of cancer gene therapy. The loss of function in secreted TK however, may present a major hurdle in the development of a transmitted form of TK.","Beerens, A M J; Rots, M G; Bermúdez, B; de Vries, E F J; Haisma, H J",Journal of drug targeting,72,1

Changing clinical practices, service needs, technological developments, regulatory changes, together with our growing professional evidence-base, all contribute to the need for our curricula to responsive and continually reviewed and enhanced. This study aims to explore similarities and differences in training curricula and follows a 2012 global survey on radiography education and more recent surveys undertaken by the European Federation of Radiographer Societies (EFRS). METHODS An online questionnaire, based on previous EFRS education and clinical education surveys, which comprised of open and closed questions and consisted of sections designed to ascertain data on: type, level and duration of education programmes leading to an initial or pre-registration qualification in radiography/medical radiation practice, pre-clinical skill development and clinical placement within programmes. The survey was distributed via social media channels and through an international network of professional societies. Descriptive statistics are reported for most analyses while open questions were analysed thematically. RESULTS Responses were received from 79 individuals from 28 identified countries across four continents. This represented a total of 121 different pre-registration/entry level programmes offered across these institutions. While dedicated diagnostic radiography programmes were most common (42/121), almost one-third of programmes (40/121) offered two or more areas of specialisation within the curriculum. The average of total hours for clinical placement were 1397 h for diagnostic radiography programmes; 1300 h for radiation therapy programmes; 1025 h for nuclear medicine programmes; and 1134 h for combined specialisation programmes, respectively. Institutions provided a range of physical and virtual systems to support pre-clinical skills development. CONCLUSION Around the world, radiography programmes vary considerably in terms of their level, duration, programme type, pre-clinical and clinical training, use of simulation, and also in terms of class sizes, student/staff ratios, and graduate employment prospects. The ability of graduates to work independently in areas covered within their programmes varied considerably. While some changes around simulation use were evident, given the impact of COVID-19 it would be beneficial for future research to investigate if pre-clinical and clinical education hours or use of simulation resources has changed due to the pandemic. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE The heterogeneity that exists between radiography programmes presents a significant challenge in terms of the mutual recognition of qualifications and the international movement of the radiographer workforce.","McNulty, J P; England, A; Shanahan, M C",Radiography,72,31

We applied Lean Six Sigma processes to optimize clinic workflow to reduce patient wait times and improve the patient experience. STUDY DESIGN Prospective cohort study. METHODS We implemented (1) pushing most extended wait times to the end of the workflow by rooming the patient directly and (2) using distractions during the waiting process by using educational videos and a timer for physician arrival in the patient exam room. We compared the patient wait times and subcomponents of Press Ganey scores as a surrogate for changes in patient experience and satisfaction from the preimplementation period (n = 277) to the 3-month (September 1, 2020, to November 30, 2020) postimplementation period (n = 218). RESULTS There was a significant reduction in overall throughput time (38 vs 35 minutes) and wait before rooming (11 vs 8 minutes), and increased physician time with patients (15 vs 17 minutes) (P < .0001 for all). These results corresponded with a significant improvement in Press Ganey subcomponents of (1) waiting time in the exam room before being seen by the care provider, (2) degree to which you were informed about any delays, (3) wait time at clinic (from arriving to leaving), and (4) length of wait before going to an exam room (P < .001 for all). CONCLUSIONS Simple, inexpensive measures can improve patient engagement and provide a safe setting for patients for clinic visits in the wake of COVID-19. In the future, clinics' common wait areas could be reappropriated to increase the number of clinic exam rooms.","Chadha, Manish; Dunne, Anne Mark; Rodriguez, Navarra; Chaudhary, Rahul",The American journal of managed care,72,24

METHODS A systematic review and a meta-analysis were performed on PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library in March 2020. Safety was evaluated through the reported side effects and effectiveness through the scores used. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias 2.0 tool and the Downs and Black checklist. For each outcome, the quality of evidence was graded according to GRADE guidelines. RESULTS Twenty-four studies (21 for OA, 3 for OLT) were included on hyaluronic acid (HA), platelet-rich plasma (PRP), saline, methylprednisolone, botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and prolotherapy. No severe adverse events were reported. For OLT, a comparison was possible between HA and PRP showing no significant difference. For ankle OA, a significant difference favouring HA versus saline was documented at six months (p < 0.001). The GRADE level of evidence was very low. CONCLUSION This meta-analysis supports the safety of intra-articular treatment for ankle OA and OLT, while only a very low evidence supports the efficacy of HA in terms of better results versus placebo for the treatment of ankle OA, and other conclusions are hindered by the scarcity of the available literature. This urges further and stronger trials to specifically investigate potential and limitations of these different injective approaches for the treatment of OLT and ankle OA.","Boffa, Angelo; Previtali, Davide; Di Laura Frattura, Giorgio; Vannini, Francesca; Candrian, Christian; Filardo, Giuseppe",International orthopaedics,72,11

Thex2 test was used to examine associations between psychological and other variables. 34% of teacherswere found to feel anxious and very anxious during the pandemic, while only 8% of teachers exhibitsevere depressive emotions. It is also clear that the educators as a professional group are predominantlypossessed by optimism about the outcome of the pandemic, as 71.5% was placed in the higherlevels of the relevant scale. Female gender was found to have a positive correlation to feelings of fear,depression, and a negative correlation to optimism. Furthermore, a negative correlation between theteachers' high educational level and their feelings of optimism emerged from the data. This optimismmay well be related with the large acceptance of the measures taken by the government to curb theexpansion of the pandemic.

Early prediction and treatment of patients at risk for HPS are required in patients undergoing CAS because HPS occurs significantly earlier after CAS than CEA. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is often used for monitoring, and indocyanine green (ICG) kinetics by NIRS (ICG-NIRS) can detect reductions in cerebral perfusion in patients with acute stroke. However, whether ICG-NIRS can predict postoperative hyperperfusion phenomenon (HP) after carotid revascularization is unclear. OBJECTIVE Here, we evaluated whether the blood flow index (BFI) ratio calculated from a time-intensity curve from ICG-NIRS monitoring can predict HPS after CAS. METHODS The BFI ratio was prospectively monitored using ICG-NIRS in 135 patients undergoing CAS. Preoperative cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and the postoperative asymmetry index (AI) were also assessed with single-photon emission computed tomography before and after CAS, and the correlation was evaluated. In addition, patients were divided into two groups, a non-HP group (n = 113) and an HP group (n = 22), and we evaluated the correlation with hemodynamic impairment in the ipsilateral hemisphere and clinical results. RESULTS Twenty-two cases (16%) showed HP, and four (3%) showed HPS after CAS. The BFI ratio calculated from ICG-NIRS showed a significant linear correlation with preoperative CVR and postoperative AI (r = -0.568, 0.538, P < 0.001, <0.001, respectively). The degree of stenosis, the rate of no cross flow, preoperative CVR, and the incidence of HPS were significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSIONS Measurement of ICG kinetics by NIRS is useful for detection of HPS in patients who underwent CAS.","Nakagawa, Ichiro; Park, Hun Soo; Yokoyama, Shohei; Yamada, Shuichi; Motoyama, Yasushi; Park, Young Su; Wada, Takeshi; Kichikawa, Kimihiko; Nakase, Hiroyuki",PloS one,72,1

However, TIP/S effect on the CF sputum microbiome has not been explored. We hypothesised that TIP/S has additional 'off-target' effects beyond merely P. aeruginosa and that baseline microbiome prior to initiation of therapy is associated with subsequent patient response. METHODS We drew sputum samples from a prospectively collected biobank. Patients were included if they had one sputum sample in the 18 months before and after TIP/S. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene profiling was used to characterise the sputum microbiome. RESULTS Forty-one patients met our inclusion criteria and 151 sputum samples were assessed. At baseline, median age was 30.4 years (IQR 24.2-35.2) and forced expiratory volume in 1 (FEV1) second was 57% predicted (IQR 44-74). Nineteen patients were defined a priori as responders having no net decrease in FEV1 in the year following TIP/S. No significant changes were observed in key microbiome metrics of alpha (within-sample) or beta (between-sample) diversity for samples collected before and after TIP/S. However, significant beta-diversity (Bray-Curtis) differences were noted at baseline between patients based on response status. Notably, responders were observed to have a higher abundance of Staphylococcus in pretherapy baseline samples.

We predict a phase transition from the ambient AlB2-type hexagonal structure to a P63/mmc hexagonal structure above 2.4 GPa. We also note that the new structure remains stable up to 50 GPa. This differs from the finding of an earlier study in which three phase transitions were reported close to 5.5, 12 and 25 GPa. An analysis of the electronic structures, Bader charge and electron localization function (ELF) indicates a complex chemical bonding comprising partial metallic, ionic (Th-Al) and covalent (Al-Al) characters in the ambient phase. Comparison of crystal parameters and ELFs for ambient and high pressure phases indicates that a change of Al-Al bonding under pressure is responsible for the structural phase transition. Furthermore, we computed the high P-T phase diagram by including the temperature effects via free energies for the most relevant structures, namely, AlB2-type, MgCu2-type and new hexagonal. We found that a MgCu2-type structure becomes stable only under high P-T conditions. We also provide a plausible explanation for the observed isostructural transition in the ambient AlB2-type structure at 5.5 GPa.","Verma, Ashok K; Modak, P",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,72,1

Whether routine supplementary administration is indicated for all patients is a debated issue. In this prospective randomized study, we assessed the incidence of systemic desaturation (SpO2 <90% or a >4% decrease lasting for more than 60 s) and wanted to find out whether cerebral desaturation occurs in parallel with systemic changes. Patients and Methods 92 consecutive patients scheduled for diagnostic bronchoscopy were randomly assigned to the no oxygen (O2- group), 2 l/min supplemental O2, or 4 l/min supplemental O2 groups. Primary end points were systemic and cerebral desaturation rate during the procedure. Secondary end points were to delineate the main risk factors of systemic and cerebral desaturation. Results In the entire cohort, systemic desaturation occurred in 18.5% of patients (n = 17), corresponding to 5 patients (16%) in the O2 (-)group, 6 patients (19%) in the 2 l/min group, and 6 patients (20%) in 4 l/min group, respectively. In the O2 (-) group, the probability of desaturation was 41.7 times higher than that in the 2 l/min group (p=0.014 s), while there was no difference in the probabilities of desaturation between the 2 l/min and 4 l/min groups (p=0.22). Cerebral desaturation (more than 20% rSO2 decrease compared to baseline) did not occur in any patients in the three groups. Systemic desaturation developed earlier, and recovery after desaturation was longer in the O2 (-) group. Male gender, smoking, and systemic oxygen saturation at baseline and FEV1% were the most significant factors contributing to systemic desaturation during bronchoscopy. Conclusions Administration of supplemental oxygen does not prevent systemic desaturation during flexible bronchoscopy, but may contribute to the shortening of desaturation episodes and faster normalization of oxygen saturation. According to our results, 2 l/min supplemental oxygen should routinely be administered to patients throughout the procedure. This trial is registered with NCT04002609.","Vaskó, Attila; Kovács, Sándor; Fülesdi, Béla; Molnár, Csilla",Emergency medicine international,72,16

Three nasopharyngeal swabs in the 96 hours following hospital admission were negative, despite a CT thorax suggestive for an early stage of infection. COVID-infection was finally confirmed in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, performed for exclusion of an alternative diagnosis in immunocompromised. In the BAL an increased cellularity with marked lymphocytosis of 35%, a reduced CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.1 and borderline neutrophilia of 3% were found. This finding might be due to the concomitant therapy with anti-CD20 antibodies, but the presence of lymphocytosis in the BAL despite peripheral lymphopenia with decreased CD4/CD8 T-cells ratio are described here for the first time in a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea), fever and initially headache were the predominant symptoms. The respiratory symptoms were scarce (variable mild dyspnea mMRC1). The respiratory conditions worsened during the hospital stay, with tachypnea up to 35/min, increased need for supplemental oxygen up to 8 L/min and worsening lung infiltrates on CT thorax on day 5. A therapy with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and an immunoglobulin-supplementation were given, with clinical and respiratory improvement, without need for intensive care or any ventilator support, and hospital discharge on day 16. Our case highlights some diagnostic and therapeutical challenges occurring in patients with COVID-19 infection. As take-home message, in the presence of clinical and radiological findings compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection we outline the importance of treating patients accordingly, also in presence of repeated negative nasopharyngeal swabs. In selected patients as in our case a bronchoscopic BAL should be considered to exclude other infections, but in our opinion not primarily to confirming COVID-19 infection. Our unique finding of a lymphocytosis in the BAL during a COVID-19 infection needs further investigations.","Caci, Grazia; Minervini, Fabrizio; Fechner, Carsten; Roos, Justus E; Obermann, Ellen C; Azzola, Andrea",Annals of translational medicine,72,25

However, DOX-induced cardiotoxicity forms the major cumulative dose-limiting factor. Glutamine and ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are putatively cardioprotective during various stresses and/or have potential chemosensitizing effects during cancer chemotherapy. METHODS Antitumor activity and cardiotoxicity of DOX treatment were evaluated simultaneously in a MatBIII mammary adenocarcinoma tumor-bearing rat model treated with DOX (cumulative dose 12 mg/kg). Single or combined treatment of parenteral glutamine (0.35 g/kg) and ω-3 PUFAs (0.19 g/kg eicosapentaenoic acid and 0.18 g/kg docosahexaenoic acid) was administered every other day, starting 6 days before chemotherapy initiation until the end of study (day 50). RESULTS Glutamine alone significantly prevented DOX-related deterioration of cardiac function, reduced serum cardiac troponin I levels, and diminished cardiac lipid peroxidation while not affecting tumor inhibition kinetics. Single ω-3 PUFA treatment significantly enhanced antitumor activity of DOX associated with intensified tumoral oxidative stress and enhanced tumoral DOX concentration while not potentiating cardiac dysfunction or increasing cardiac oxidative stress. Intriguingly, providing glutamine and ω-3 PUFAs together did not consistently confer a greater benefit; conversely, individual benefits on cardiotoxicity and chemosensitization were mostly attenuated or completely lost when combined. CONCLUSIONS Our data demonstrate an interesting differentiality or even dichotomy in the response of tumor and host to single parenteral glutamine and ω-3 PUFA treatments. The intriguing glutamine × ω-3 PUFA interaction observed draws into question the common assumption that there are additive benefits of combinations of nutrients that are beneficial on an individual basis.","Xue, Hongyu; Ren, Wenhua; Denkinger, Melanie; Schlotzer, Ewald; Wischmeyer, Paul E",JPEN.

In this study, the popular autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) will be used to forecast the cumulative number of confirmed, recovered cases, and the number of deaths in Pakistan from COVID-19 spanning June 25, 2020 to July 04, 2020 (10 days ahead forecast). Methods To meet the desire objectives, data for this study have been taken from the Ministry of National Health Service of Pakistan’s website from February 27, 2020 to June 24, 2020. Two different ARIMA models will be used to obtain the next 10 days ahead point and 95% interval forecast of the cumulative confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths. Statistical software, RStudio, with “forecast”, “ggplot2”, “tseries”, and “seasonal” packages have been used for data analysis. Results The forecasted cumulative confirmed cases, recovered, and the number of deaths up to July 04, 2020 are 231239 with a 95% prediction interval of (219648, 242832), 111616 with a prediction interval of (101063, 122168), and 5043 with a 95% prediction interval of (4791, 5295) respectively. Statistical measures i.e. root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are used for model accuracy. It is evident from the analysis results that the ARIMA and seasonal ARIMA model is better than the other time series models in terms of forecasting accuracy and hence recommended to be used for forecasting epidemics like COVID-19. Conclusion It is concluded from this study that the forecasting accuracy of ARIMA models in terms of RMSE, and MAE are better than the other time series models, and therefore could be considered a good forecasting tool in forecasting the spread, recoveries, and deaths from the current outbreak of COVID-19. Besides, this study can also help the decision-makers in developing short-term strategies with regards to the current number of disease occurrences until an appropriate medication is developed. © 2020 Ali et al.

At the end of December 2019, a kind of new pneumonia feast quickly in Wuhan, China, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCov). Objective: Systematic analysis of the completed clinical trials in humans due to coronavirus disease in 2019 between January 12, 2020, to May 30, 2020 in 11 countries and possibly to recommend the ways to overcome the COV-2 pandemic. Methods: Clinical studies completed in humans for the treatment of coronavirus disease in 2019 were looked for two databases, namely PubMed and Scopus. Based on the search terms, a total of 369 articles were downloaded. Of the total 369 articles, 38 duplicate articles were removed and 331 articles were screened with objective criterion. From the 331 articles, 168 articles were screened for excluded based on abstract screening and left with 163. Based on the exclusion criteria, 82 review articles, 51 articles not related to SARSCOV- 2 and 4 articles not written in English, in total 137 articles were excluded. Eventually, 26 articles were reviewed with required parameters for conclusive remarks. Results: Of all the completed human clinical trials conducted in 11 countries obtained from https://clinicaltrials.gov/, the total patients included in the clinical trials from January 12, 2020 to May 30, 2020 were 6130. Out of them 1060 (17.29%) were only females and the rest 5070 (82.71%) were both males and females. From all patients studied, 163 patients were 30-70 years old, 60 patients were 60 years old, 2531 patients were of all age groups and the rest 3376 patients were >= 18 years old. Of all the completed clinical trials in 11 countries, eight different interventional models and four study types were used. Conclusion: From the analysis of segregated results it is apparent that there was inclusion of patients with varied age group in the studies conducted with very less amount of patients from <= 18 years old, old age group and only females. The prime reason for least percentage inclusion of different age groups could be the weaker inherent immune response for the pandemic. COVID-19 can cause a conceivably deadly infection in humans. The most typical clinical manifestations reported by patients with coronavirus disease in 2019 were fever, cough, and expectoration. Approval of vaccines for control of COVID-19 is yet to be officially done, although now few vaccines are administered. Knowing the way to enter the cell and the mechanism on how to escape the immune system can be the potential targets to develop a novel SARS-COV-2 treatment protocol.","Belachew, G.

The sudden outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during Spring 2020 may have been a common focus of co-rumination. Conceptualized within a contextual behavioral science framework, the current study examined pandemic-focused co-rumination and its components: co-brooding (i.e., passively dwelling on concerns and associated consequences and negative emotions in a dyadic context) and co-reflection (i.e., repetitively discussing problems dyadically to enhance insight). A total of 320 undergraduates (62 %, female, 37 % male, 1 % non-binary gender) completed an online survey from late April-early May 2020 shortly after their universities abruptly ended in-person instruction and removed students from campus. COVID-19-focused co-rumination (specifically co-brooding) was associated with higher levels of internalizing symptoms. Co-brooding and co-reflection each moderated the association between COVID-19 stress exposure and a) internalizing symptoms (COVID-related fears and depressive symptoms) and b) committed action, but in opposite directions, with co-brooding predicting increased symptoms and decreased committed action, and co-reflection predicting the opposite. Results suggest that when the nature of social support-seeking discussions promote psychological flexibility via increased perspective and understanding (vs. dwelling on negative content of experiences), they may ameliorate emotional distress and promote committed action following stress exposure. © 2021 Association for Contextual Behavioral Science","Starr, L.

A threedimensional body-manikin of African athlete of 1.8 meters tall was employed to the expiration (exhalation) flow study using ANSYS-Fluent software. There were two different mask models included in the flow simulations and were manufactured by means of 3D-printing technology. The two manufactured masks were designed using SolidWorks software. The study was carried out four times during the exhalation process of a human wearing the two masks and without wearing them. The velocity magnitudes were significantly different while wearing the mask in comparison to the cases of not wearing it. The results demonstrate the capability of using 3D-printed masks as a replacement of the traditional medical masks (i.e., N95 and surgical masks) with retaining the same functions of the protective mask. Thus, based on the present study and due to the great shortage of surgical and medical masks availability locally and globally, the 3D-printed masks might be a temporary solution to limit the vast spread of contagious diseases like the dangerous COVID-19 outbreak. © 2021.

Guidelines recommend evaluation of pts' symptom burdens and prognostic risk scores at clinic visits. The myeloproliferative neoplasm symptom assessment form total symptom score (MPN-SAF TSS) is a standardized system that evaluates 10 specific MPN-related symptoms on a scale of 1-10. Furthermore, the dynamic prognostic scoring system plus (DIPSS plus) has been validated as a risk stratification tool for MF pts at any point during the disease course. At our institution, leukemia physicians have created an MF pathway to guide practitioners throughout a large healthcare system with many locations. The pathway recommends MPN-SAF TSS and DIPSS plus risk score with clinic visits occurring every 3-6 months. Unfortunately, the traditional approach to obtaining the MPN-SAF TSS and DIPSS plus score is burdensome for many providers and pts. Moreover, a recent analysis (Verstovsek Ann Hematol 2020) demonstrates that risk prognostication is very often performed incorrectly. We designed a study to streamline workflow by incorporating our specialty pharmacy to assist in the completion of the MPN-SAF TSS and DIPSS plus score via telephone prior to clinic visits. We hypothesized that partnership between our physicians and the specialty pharmacy may benefit pts by increasing adherence to the MF pathway. Methods: This study is conducted in two parts, a retrospective and a prospective phase. A review 12 months prior to start of study was completed to gain historical insight on provider adherence to the MF pathway, with attention to MPN-SAF TSS and DIPSS plus. Then, a prospective study was designed to include new or established MF pts. Pts would be followed for 12 months after start of study. The pilot study was open only at our largest site, home to a subspecialty leukemia clinic where disease-specific physicians practice. For pts who enroll in the prospective study, specialty pharmacists complete both the MPN-SAF TSS and the DIPSS plus score ~3 months via phone prior to clinic visits. Calls for each pt are completed within 10 days of the pt's next visit. If the pharmacist is unable to reach the pt, the physician is notified via EMR message. Completed assessments are documented in the EMR. All enrolled pts are evaluated for MF pathway adherence during the study period. Results: We reviewed system-wide charts for 12 months prior to March 1, 2020 to assess if DIPSS and/or MPN SAF forms were documented for MF patients. 79 MF pts, treated by 32 physicians, were identified. Patients in remission after allogeneic stem cell transplantation were excluded. 36 pts (46%) had the MPN-SAF TSS completed and 53 pts (67%) had DIPSS plus performed at least once in the preceding 12 months. 45 pts, treated by 8 physicians, were followed primarily at the pilot site. 27 pts (60%) had MPN-SAF TSS documented and 38 (84%) had DIPSS Plus performed at least once in the preceding 12 months. The prospective study was initiated on March 1, 2020. As of July 15, 2020, 32 patients have been screened for enrollment by treating physicians. This includes 3 newly diagnosed patients not included in the retrospective analysis. 22 pts have had their initial assessments completed. 2 pts could not be reached, 1 of which died prior to the next clinic visit, 2 pts declined the study, and 6 pts had not yet had clinic visits. Of the 22 pts consented and contacted for the study, 100% had the MPN-SAF TSS and DIPSS Plus score documented with their first visit during the study period. To date 11 pts (of the initial 22) have undergone reevaluation;100% had the MPN-SAF TSS and DIPSS Plus score documented with their 3-month follow-up visit. Conclusion: Many practicing clinicians perform MPN-SAF TSS and DIPSS plus scores for MF pts. However, there are lapses in the uptake of both. At our institution, the DIPSS plus score is performed more commonly than the MPN-SAF TSS. This early analysis suggests that a telemedicine approach and partnership between specialty pharmacy and physicians can optimize clinical wor flow. With the initial success of this pilot, our program is expanding study enrollment to include regional clinics. Due to the COVID19 pandemic, there is now heightened interest in telemedicine practices. Preliminary data from this study suggest that a multidisciplinary approach incorporating telemedicine for MF pts provides an effective approach to measuring patient symptom burdens and assigning prognostic categories.

The CCA foregrounds the interplays of communicative and material inequalities, suggesting that the erasure of infrastructures of voices among the margins reproduces and circulates unhealthy structures that threaten the health and well-being of the working classes. The voices of the low-wage migrant workers who participated in this study document the challenges with poor housing, poor sanitation, and food insecurity that are compounded with the absence of information and voice infrastructures. Amid the everyday threats to health and well-being that are generated by neoliberal reforms across the globe, the hyper-precarious conditions of migrant work rendered visible by the trajectories of COVID-19 call for structurally transformative futures that are anchored in the voices of workers at the margins of neoliberal economies.","Dutta, M.

Vehicle emissions generally depend on many factors, such as the nature of the vehicle, driving style, traffic conditions, emission control technologies, and operational conditions. Concerns about the certification cycles used by various regulatory authorities are growing due to the difference in emission during certification procedure and Real Driving Emissions (RDE). Under laboratory conditions, certification tests are performed in a ‘chassis dynamometer’ for light-duty vehicles (LDVs) and an ‘engine dynamometer’ for heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs). As a result, the test drive cycles used to measure the automotive emissions do not correctly reflect the vehicle’s real-world driving pattern. Consequently, the RDE regulation is being phased in to reduce the disparity between type approval and vehicle’s real-world emissions. According to this review, different variables such as traffic signals, driving dynamics, congestions, altitude, ambient temperature, and so on have a major influence on actual driving pollution. Aside from that, cold-start and hot-start have been shown to have an effect on on-road pollution. Contrary to common opinion, new technology such as start-stop systems boost automotive emissions rather than decreasing them owing to unfavourable conditions from the point of view of exhaust emissions and exhaust after-treatment systems. In addition, the driving dynamics are not represented in the current laboratory-based test procedures. As a result, it is critical to establish an on-road testing protocol to obtain a true representation of vehicular emissions and reduce emissions to a standard level. The incorporation of RDE clauses into certification procedures would have a positive impact on global air quality.","Ashrafur Rahman, S. M.; Rizwanul Fattah, I.

However, most of the classical models fail to account for certain features of this disease and others like it, such as the ability of exposed individuals to recover without becoming infectious, or the possibility that asymptomatic individuals can indeed transmit the disease but at a lesser rate than the symptomatic. Furthermore, the rise of new disease variants and the imperfection of vaccines suggest that concept of endemic equilibrium is perhaps more pertinent than that of herd immunity. Here we propose a new compartmental epidemiological model and study its equilibria, characterizing the stability of both the endemic and disease-free equilibria in terms of the basic reproductive number.

Scientists from worldwide have been successful in developing the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but COVID-19 vaccination faces several challenges which may impact its success. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was done to determine the beliefs and perceptions of people on COVID-19 vaccination in Delhi in the month of March-April 2021 with the help of a questionnaire which was distributed online. It contained 22 questions and was finalized after the review through a pilot study and content validation. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel 2007. Results: A total of 286 participants were analyzed, of which 55% were female. The mean age was 33.4 years. Intention of people for taking vaccination was analyzed with relation to different age groups, and positive trend was seen in people with advancing age and it was also statistically significant (P = 0.002). It was seen that people with higher education and of higher socioeconomic status were more inclined to get vaccination;however, in our study, 39.1% of the participants were concerned about the safety of the vaccine. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that despite repeated assurance about the safety of vaccine, people still had doubts and misconceptions which were evident from our study. Hence, this study may help the administrators to understand the community concerns, tweaking current policies, and increasing the awareness campaign so that people gather more knowledge about vaccine benefits and community trust is built.","Sharma, A.; Srivastava, A.",Indian Journal of Medical Specialities,72,16

Such information about zakat in the virtual world creates unstructured data, which contains important information and knowledge. This paper aims to discover knowledge related to zakat administration during the pandemic from the information in a virtual environment. Furthermore, the discussion is contextualised to the socio-economic debates. Design/methodology/approach: This is a qualitative study operated via text mining to discover knowledge of zakat administration during the COVID-19 pandemic. The National Board of Zakat Republic of Indonesia (BAZNAS RI) is selected for a single case study. This paper samples BAZNAS RI’s situation report on COVID-19 from its virtual website. The data consists of 40 digital pages containing 19,812 characters, 3,004 words and 3,003 white spaces. The text mining analytical steps are performed via RStudio. The following R packages, networkD3, igraph, ggraph and ggplot2 are used to run the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modelling. Findings: The machine learning analysis via RStudio results in the 16 topics associated with the 3 primary topics (i.e. Education, Sadaqah and Health Services). The topic modelling discovers knowledge about BAZNAS RI’s assistance for COVID-19 relief, which may help the readers understand zakat administration in times of the pandemic from BAZNAS RI’s virtual website. This finding may draw the theory of socio-economic zakat, which explains that zakat as a religious obligation plays a critical role in shaping a Muslim community's social and economic processes, notably during the unprecedented times of COVID-19. Research limitations/implications: This study uses data from a single zakat institution. Thus, the generalisation of the finding is limited to the sampled institution. Practical implications: This research is both theoretically and practically important for academics and industry professionals. This paper contributes to the novelty in performing text mining via R in gaining knowledge about the recent zakat administration from a virtual website. The finding of this study (i.e. the topic modelling) is practically essential for zakat stakeholders to understand the contribution of zakat in managing the COVID-19 impacts. Social implications: This work derives a theory of “socio-economic zakat” that explains the importance of a zakat institution in activating zakat for managing socio-economic issues during the pandemic. Thus, paying zakat to an authorised institution may actualise more maslahah (public interest) compared to paying it directly to the asnaf (zakat beneficiaries) without any measurement Originality/value: This study is among the pioneers in gaining knowledge from Indonesia’s zakat management during the COVID-19 outbreak via text mining.

The present study investigates the vulnerable groups’ reaction from informal sectors to the execution of the self-isolation policy of COVID-19 in Semarang City, Indonesia. This study is designed using a qualitative method with an ethnography approach. Using the binary opposition thinking pattern pioneered by Levi-Strauss, this study conducts the interview process with 25 informants in Semarang City. The data analysed using the response pattern of informants. We use the taxonomy analysis and finds three levels of vulnerability group;(a) jobs lost, (b) income decreased, and (c) delayed salary. The result of the analysis found that the group that obeys self-isolation is a rational thinking model. They stay at home, do not go to work, and no income. Also, the group who ignored self-isolation is a non-rational thinking model. They work, as usual, get their salaries, and believe that Covid-19 is a disaster;they pray for their safety to God. In conclusion, COVID 19 brings an economic impact on vulnerable groups in the forms of postponing, declining, and missing income. Even its circumstances are worse when self-isolation is forced. Thus, this study suggests that the government needs to assist vulnerable groups by focusing on strategic policies, such as strategies for survival, providing access to basic needs, and livelihood plans by providing access to improve livelihoods sustainably. © 2021, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

Efforts to assess “zoonotic risk” often use trait-based analyses to identify which viral and reservoir host groups are most likely to source zoonoses but have not fully addressed how and why the impacts of zoonotic viruses vary in terms of disease severity (‘virulence’), capacity to spread within human populations (‘transmissibility’), or total human mortality (‘death burden’). We analyzed trends in human case fatality rates, transmission capacities, and total death burdens across a comprehensive dataset of mammalian and avian zoonotic viruses. Bats harbor the most virulent zoonotic viruses even when compared to birds, which alongside bats, have been hypothesized to be “special” zoonotic reservoirs due to molecular adaptations that support the physiology of flight. Reservoir host groups more closely related to humans—in particular, Primates—harbor less virulent, but more highly transmissible viruses. Importantly, disproportionately high human death burden, arguably the most important metric of zoonotic risk, is not associated with any animal reservoir, including bats. Our data demonstrate that mechanisms driving death burdens are diverse and often contradict trait-based predictions. Ultimately, total human mortality is dependent on context-specific epidemiological dynamics, which are shaped by a combination of viral traits and conditions in the animal host population and across and beyond the human-animal interface. Understanding the conditions that predict high zoonotic burden in humans will require longitudinal studies of epidemiological dynamics in wildlife and human populations. Significance statement The clear need to mitigate zoonotic risk has fueled increased viral discovery in specific reservoir host taxa. We show that a combination of viral and reservoir traits can predict zoonotic virus virulence and transmissibility in humans, supporting the hypothesis that bats harbor exceptionally virulent zoonoses. However, pandemic prevention requires thinking beyond zoonotic capacity, virulence, and transmissibility to consider collective ‘burden’ on human health. For this, viral discovery targeting specific reservoirs may be inefficient as death burden correlates with viral, not reservoir, traits, and depends on context-specific epidemiological dynamics across and beyond the human-animal interface. These findings suggest that longitudinal studies of viral dynamics in reservoir and spillover host populations may offer the most effective strategy for mitigating zoonotic risk.","Guth, Sarah; Mollentze, Nardus; Renault, Katia; Streicker, Daniel G.; Visher, Elisa; Boots, Mike; Brook, Cara E.",bioRxiv,72,24

The mainstream research on detecting fake news so far has been text-based detection approaches, but they have inherent limitations such as the difficulty of short text processing and language dependency. Thus, as an alternative to the text-based approach, the context-based approach is emerging. The most common context-based approach the use of distributors’ network information in social media. However, such information is difficult to obtain, and only propagation within a single social media can be traced. Under this background, we propose the use of composition pattern of web links containing news content as a new source of information for fake news detection. To properly vectorize the composition pattern of web links, this study proposes a novel embedding technique, which is called link2vec, an extension of word2vec. To test the effectiveness and language independency of our link2vec-based model, we applied it to two real-world fake news datasets in different languages (English and Korean). As comparison models, we adopted the conventional text-based model and a hybrid model that combined text and whitelist-based link information proposed by a prior study. Results revealed that in the datasets in two languages, the link2vec-based detection models outperformed all the comparison models with statistical significance. Our research is expected to contribute to suggesting a completely new path for effective fake news detection.","Shim, Jae-Seung Lee Yunju Ahn Hyunchul",Expert Systems with Applications,72,24

In order to meet the increasing needs of literature classification, this paper will explore an automated literature classification model. [method] firstly, more than 20000 articles related to covid-19 in CNKI were collected as the marked data set, and the title, keyword and abstract information of the articles were extracted. Then, different combinations of the title, keyword and abstract were used as the input of different features of the model, and the support vector machine (SVM) based literature classification model and BERT-LSTM based literature classification model were trained respectively and the effect of the model was compared. [Results] The accuracy of the feature combination of “title + keyword + abstract” in the BERT-BiLSTM model was 85.79%, which was higher than the accuracy of the feature combination of “title + keyword” and “keyword + abstract”. The accuracy of the benchmark model (SVM) with the combination of “title + keyword + abstract” is 78.79%, so the model based on BERT-BiLSTM can significantly improve the classification effect.

Although the primary site of infection is the lung, growing evidence points towards a crucial role of the intestinal epithelium. Yet, the exact effects of viral infection and the role of intestinal epithelial-immune cell interactions in mediating the inflammatory response are not known. In this work, we apply network biology approaches to single-cell RNA-seq data from SARS-CoV-2 infected human ileal and colonic organoids to investigate how altered intracellular pathways upon infection in intestinal enterocytes leads to modified epithelial-immune crosstalk. We point out specific epithelial-immune interactions which could help SARS-CoV-2 evade the immune response. By integrating our data with existing experimental data, we provide a set of epithelial ligands likely to drive the inflammatory response upon infection. Our integrated analysis of intra- and inter-cellular molecular networks contribute to finding potential drug targets, and suggest using existing anti-inflammatory therapies in the gut as promising drug repurposing strategies against COVID-19.","Poletti, Martina; Treveil, Agatha; Csabai, Luca; Gul, Leila; Modos, Dezso; Madgwick, Matthew; Olbei, Marton; Bohar, Balazs; Valdeolivas, Alberto; Turei, Denes; Verstockt, Bram; Triana, Sergio; Alexandrov, Theodore; Saez-Rodriguez, Julio; Stanifer, Megan L.; Boulant, Steeve; Korcsmaros, Tamas",bioRxiv,72,16

As faculty and administrators worked hard to overcommunicate with students in the hopes of keeping them engaged and focused on their academic pursuits, students found their attentions split among school, the Covid-19 health pandemic, and paying bills as many lost their employment. In some cases, the overcommunication led to students ignoring messages as they were completely overwhelmed;at the same time, some students found themselves reverting back to looking for the days of someone telling them what to do every minute of the day. Because faculty, and administrators, were not well prepared to handle the situation, an unevenness in how faculty communicated with students occurred. That is, some faculty withdrew in the same way that students did, and the term essentially ended with students turning in remaining assignments even though no further instruction occurred. Other faculty tried to move their face-to-face class online without taking into consideration the differences between these two channels. Still others tried to create an online course as they went from week to week. The inconsistencies across classes combined with the additional stress students were already experiencing became a recipe for exactly what the administration was trying to avoid-unsuccessful completion of courses and/or students unprepared for the courses that would come after the ones in which they were enrolled that term. The purpose of this study is to examine the experiences and perceptions of students when their classes pivoted from face-to-face to mediated, usually through video conferencing for synchronous or learning management systems for asynchronous. More specifically, we have collected qualitative data that addresses the communication students received from their instructors, what they believed instructors did successfully, what instructors could have done better, and the advice they would offer to instructors who found themselves in a similar crisis situation in the future.","Garland, M.

Setting: This study was embedded within the Rhineland Study, an ongoing community-based cohort study in Bonn, Germany Design: Cross-sectional nested case-control study. Participants: Participants were selected based on results from a previously conducted seroprevalence survey within the framework of the Rhineland Study. Cases were defined as those individuals who had had two positive confirmatory test results, including a recombinant spike-based immunofluorescence assay and a plaque reduction neutralization test (N=21). As controls, a random sample of individuals with a negative ELISA test result (Controls I, N=1117), and those with a borderline or positive ELISA test result who failed confirmatory testing (Controls II, N=68), were selected. Outcome measures: Plasma levels of NfL at the time of measurement, as well as change in plasma NfL levels compared to previously measured pre-pandemic levels Results: After adjustment for age, sex and batch effects, serologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was neither associated with cross-sectional NfL levels, nor with the magnitude of change from pre-pandemic levels, compared to either of the two control groups. Similarly, after adjustment for age, sex and batch effects, self-reported neurological symptoms (including altered sense of smell or taste, headache, myalgia and fever) were not associated with changes in NfL levels in participants with a serologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (all p [≥] 0.56). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease-19 is unlikely to be associated with a clinically relevant degree of neuroaxonal damage, even in those cases associated with neurological symptoms.","Aziz, N.

On the other hand, recent data from the use of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the COVID19 pandemic have cast some doubts on its cardiological safety. Objectives: To identify factors associated to CHF in SLE. Methods: Retrospective cross-sectional study, including all patients with SLE (≥4 ACR-1997 criteria) recruited in RELESSER registry. The objectives and methodology of the registry have been described previously (1). CHF was defined according to the Charlson index item. Patients with CHF before diagnosis of SLE were excluded. Cumulative damage was measured with the SLICC/ ACR index, excluding cardiovascular (CV) items (mSDI). Multivariate analysis exploring factors associated with CHF was carried out. Results: 117 patients (3% of the entire cohort) with SLE and CHF and 3,506 controls with SLE without CHF were included. 90% were women. Disease duration: mean (SD), 120.2 (87.7) months. CHF appeared after a median (P25-P75) of 9.40 (4.2-18.3) years from SLE diagnosis. Patients with CHF were older (59.8 ± 18.2 vs. 46.2 ± 4.3). In the bivariate analysis, the association of CHF with greater severity [Katz severity index: median (IQR): 4 (3-5) vs. 2 (1-3)], damage [mSDI: 3 (2-4) vs 0 (0-1)], comorbidity [modified Charlson-excluding CV items: 4 (3-6) vs 1(1-3)] and both CV (37.5% vs 6.7%) and overall mortality (43.2% vs 4.7%) (p<0.0001 for all comparisons). Also, CHF patients were more refractory to SLE treatments (33.3% vs 24%, p=0.0377) and were more frequently hospitalised due SLE [median 3 (1-5) vs 1(0-2), p<0.0001]. The results of the multivariable model are depicted in table 1. Conclusion: -CHF is a rather late complication of SLE. -Patients with SLE and CHF have more severe SLE, with greater refractoriness to SLE treatments and higher overall mortality. -Treatment with antimalarials, as routinely used in SLE patients, is not only safe to heart, but even appears to have a cardioprotective effect.

However, EDS patients’ estimates were less precise when based purely on proprioception and could be partially predicted by Beighton score. Conclusions EDS patients are less precise at estimating their hand’s location when only afferent information is available, but the presence of efferent signalling may reduce this imprecision.

This second social contact survey aimed to enable, for the first time, the estimation of social mixing patterns for an age range of 0 to 99 years and the investigation of whether contact rates remain stable over this 5-year time period. Methods: Different data mining techniques are used to explore the data, and the age-specific number of social contacts and the age-specific contact rates are modelled using a GAMLSS model. We compare different matrices using assortativeness measures. The relative change in the basic reproduction number (R0) and the ratio of relative incidences with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals (BCI) are employed to investigate and quantify the impact on epidemic spread due to differences in gender, day of the week, holiday vs. regular periods and changes in mixing patterns over the 5-year time gap between the 2006 and 2010-2011 surveys. Finally, we compare the fit of the contact matrices in 2006 and 2010-2011 to Varicella serological data. Results: All estimated contact patterns featured strong homophily in age and gender, especially for small children and adolescents. A 30% (95% BCI [17%; 37%]) and 29% (95% BCI [14%; 40%]) reduction in R0 was observed for weekend versus weekdays and for holiday versus regular periods, respectively. Significantly more interactions between people aged 60+ years and their grandchildren were observed on holiday and weekend days than on regular weekdays. Comparing contact patterns using different methods did not show any substantial differences over the 5-year time period under study. Conclusions: The second social contact survey in Flanders, Belgium, endorses the findings of its 2006 predecessor and adds important information on the social mixing patterns of people older than 60 years of age. Based on this analysis, the mixing patterns of people older than 60 years exhibit considerable heterogeneity, and overall, the comparison of the two surveys shows that social contact rates can be assumed stable in Flanders over a time span of 5 years.","Hoang, T.

It uses transfer learning and parameter optimization to enable efficient, decentralized, iterative reference building, and the contextualization of new datasets with existing references without sharing raw data. Using examples from mouse brain, pancreas, and whole organism atlases, we showcase that scArches preserves nuanced biological state information while removing batch effects in the data, despite using four orders of magnitude fewer parameters compared to de novo integration. To demonstrate mapping disease variation, we show that scArches preserves detailed COVID-19 disease variation upon reference mapping, enabling discovery of new cell identities that are unseen during training. We envision our method to facilitate collaborative projects by enabling the iterative construction, updating, sharing, and efficient use of reference atlases.","Lotfollahi, Mohammad; Naghipourfar, Mohsen; Luecken, Malte D.; Khajavi, Matin; Büttner, Maren; Avsec, Ziga; Misharin, Alexander V.; Theis, Fabian J.",bioRxiv,72,33

The range of the investigated variables was common for the operation of fumigators used to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The liquid flow rate (weighting method), the field of velocity, and turbulent flow intensity factor, as well as velocity profiles over the section of 1 m from the nozzle were determined using the particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique.

Given the ready availability of auxiliary sources of noisy genotype data – such as acquiring small samples of environmental DNA or learning about someone’s Mendelian diseases and physical characteristics – inference on sparse data becomes a genuine concern. We explore cases where query individuals are either known to be in databases or not, and consider both simulated “mosaics” of genotypes (i.e. genotypes stitched together from diploid segments sampled from two or more source individuals) and actual genotype data obtained from swabs of coffee cups used by a known individual. Our findings are as follows: (1) Even 10 common SNPs (minor allele frequency > 0.05) often are sufficient to identify individuals in conventional genomic databases. (2) We are able to identify first-order relatives (parents, children and siblings) of query individuals with 20-30 common SNPs. (3) We find some potential for leakage of phenotypic information, based on a simulated attack by combining polygenic risk scores (PRSs) of the piecewise genotypic matches. We also found, for simulated mosaics of two individuals, that 20 common SNPs were often sufficient to find the correct identities of both component individuals. Finally, applying PLIGHT to coffee-cup-derived SNPs, we find that our tool is able identify the individual (when present in the reference database) using as little as 30 SNPs; alternatively, when the individual is not present in the reference database, we reconstruct possible genomes for the individual based on just 30-90 query SNPs by piecewise matching to the reference haplotype database. In this way, we are able to perform a small degree of imputation of unobserved query SNPs. Overall, the tool could be used to determine the value of selectively masking released SNPs, in a way that is agnostic to any explicit assumptions about underlying population membership or allele frequencies.","Emani, Prashant S.; Gürsoy, Gamze; Miranker, Andrew; Gerstein, Mark B.",bioRxiv,72,1

However, the kinetics of the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 remains poorly described and relies on the performance of the different serological tests. In this study, we evaluated the performance of six CE-marked point-of-care tests (POC) and three ELISA assays for the diagnosis of COVID-19 by exploring seroconversions in hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Both the ELISA and POC tests were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in at least half of the samples collected seven days or more after the onset of symptoms. After 15 days, the rate of detection rose to over 80% but without reaching 100%, irrespective of the test used. More than 90% of the samples collected after 15 days tested positive using the iSIA and Accu-Tell POC tests and the ID.Vet IgG ELISA assay. Seroconversion was observed 5 to 12 days after the onset of symptoms. Three assays suffer from a specificity below 90% (EUROIMMUN IgG and IgA, UNscience, Zhuhai Livzon). The second week of COVID-19 seems to be the best period for assessing the sensitivity of commercial serological assays. To achieve an early diagnosis of COVID-19 based on antibody detection, a dual challenge must be met: the immunodiagnostic window period must be shortened and an optimal specificity must be conserved.","TUAILLON, Edouard; Bollore, Karine; Pisoni, Amandine; Debiesse, Segolene; Renault, Constance; Marie, Sylvain; Groc, Soraya; Niels, Clemence; Pansu, Nathalie; Dupuy, Anne-Marie; Morquin, David; Foulongne, Vincent; Bourdin, Arnaud; Moing, Vincent Le; Perre, Philippe Van de",,72,25

Unfortunately, COVID-19 is not only a short-term infection but that patients (pts) recovering from SARS-CoV2 infection complain of persisting symptoms including: fatigue, diffuse myalgia and weakness, which may lead to chronic fatigue syndrome. There is currently no evidence that nutritional supplements and/or physical exercise can assist in the recovery of pts with chronic fatigue syndrome. 1-Methylnicotinamide (1-MNA) is an endogenic substance that is produced in the liver when nicotinic acid is metabolized. 1-MNA demonstrates anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties. Therefore, we investigated whether 1-MNA supplements could improve exercise tolerance and decrease fatigue among patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2. Methods: The study population was composed of pts after COVID-19, expressing subjective feelings of limited tolerance to exercise. The selected pts were randomized into two groups: GrM0 without supplementation; GrM1 with 1-MNA supplementation. At the beginning of the study (Phase 0), in both groups, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT) was carried out and fa-tigue assessment with Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) was performed. After 1 month (Phase 1), a follow up FSS and 6MWT once more were performed in both groups. Results: A significant improvement in the mean distance covered in the 6MWT was noted among the pts in GrM1, compared to those in GrM0. We also noted that in GrM1 the 6MWT distance was significantly higher after 1 month of supplementation with 1-MNA, compared to the beginning of the study (515.18 m in Phase 0 vs 557.8m in Phase 1; p = 0.000034). In GrM1, significantly more pts improved their distance in the 6MWT (23 out of 25 pts, equal to 92%), by a mean of 47 meters, compared to GrM0 (15 of 25 pts, equal to 60%) (p = 0.0061). After one month, significantly more patients in the group without 1-MNA had severe fatigue (FSS [≥] 4) compared to the group with supplementation (GrM1 = 5 pts (20%) vs GrM0 = 14pts (56%); p = 0.008). Conclusions: 1-MNA supplementation significantly improved physical performance in a 6-minute walk test and reduced the percentage of patients with severe fatigue after COVID-19. The comprehensive action of 1-MNA, including anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant effects, as well as activation of the SIRT1 enzyme, may be beneficial for the recovery of patients with persistent symptoms of fatigue and low tolerance to exercise after COVID-19.

This study investigated the online and offline teaching effect of university students in Zhejiang province, and explored the influence of the introduction of new technology on the knowledge dissemination effect, as well as the weight relation of each element in it. It is found that the free environment after leaving the fixed classroom, rich teaching resources and diversified teaching tools have a positive impact on the effect of knowledge dissemination. On the other hand, the lack of interpersonal communication in teaching, interactive question-answering and the group atmosphere of classroom teaching lead to the decline in teaching effect for some students with poor autonomy. Furthermore, the research believes that technology solves the temporal and spatial problem of knowledge dissemination, but the discipline and constraints from groups are also reduced due to the intervention of technology.

Aims Ascertain changes across settings in healthcare service presentations with self-harm during Waves 1 and 2 of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method E-cohort study using individual-level linked routine healthcare data from Wales, UK, 2016-March 2021. We measured weekly proportion of self-harm contacts and people who self-harmed in contact with general practice (GP), emergency department (ED) and hospital admissions. We modelled weekly trends using linear regression and generalised estimated equations, quantifying time differences using difference-in-difference (DiD). Results We included 3,552,210 Welsh residents aged [≥]10 years. Counts of self-harm presentations across settings was at a minimum at the start of stay-at-home restrictions during both waves and recovered compared to previous years in 3-5 months. Those who self-harmed in April 2020 were more likely to be seen in GP compared to other settings and previous years - mean rate of OR=1.2, although actual numbers fell. The proportion of self-harm ED contacts admitted to hospital dropped from June 2020 (1.9 [1.5-2.3] pp/month). Self-harm and COVID-19 infection had a bidirectional effect - self-harm history had OR=1.4 [1.2-1.6] and incidence had DiD=1.1 [0.8-1.4]. Conclusions Those that self-harmed and sought help during the COVID-19 pandemic potentially encountered stringent criteria for hospitalisation, particularly in Wave 2, while in Wave 1 they preferentially presented to GP. Reductions in contacts likely resulted in unmet healthcare needs which may later emerge placing further burden on individuals and healthcare services.","del Pozo Banos, M.; Lee, S.

Recent studies have described short term outcomes of COVID19 infection post allogeneic (allo) and autologous (auto) HCT. In this study we provide long term follow-up of the outcomes of COVID19 infection in allo and auto HCT recipients. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of adult patients who have received allo or auto HCT and were subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 infection between March-December 2020. We summarized patient characteristics, laboratory and treatment data related to COVID-19 infection in these patients. Results: In this study, we provide long-term follow-up of over 7 months. Fifteen patients were identified for inclusion (allo n = 12, auto n = 3). Median follow-up was 7.8 months (range 1.9-10.7) for surviving patients. Median age at COVID-19 diagnosis was 55 years (range 24-77). Most patients were &gt; 1 year out from transplant (allo n = 10, auto n = 1, 73%). Two patients (allo n = 1, auto n = 1, 13%) had undergone transplant within the preceding month. Most allo patients (n = 11, 73%) had received myeloablative conditioning. At the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, 9 allo patients (75%) were on immunosuppression (IS) (n = 7 for chronic graftversus-host-disease (GVHD);n = 2 for GVHD prophylaxis). Eleven patients (73%) required hospitalization (allo n = 9, auto n = 2). Per the National Institutes of Health definitions of COVID-19 illness severity, 3 patients had critical disease (allo n = 2, auto n = 1, 20%), 5 severe (allo n = 5, 33%), 3 moderate (allo n = 2, auto n = 1, 20%), and 4 mild (allo n = 3, auto n = 1, 27%). All patients with chronic GVHD required hospitalization. Two patients died (allo n = 1, auto n = 1, 13%)-both had critical COVID-19 infections, were &gt; 65 years old, &gt; 3 years out from transplant, and had significant comorbidities. The allo patient was receiving prednisone &lt; 1 mg/kg for chronic lung GVHD at COVID-19 diagnosis. Two allo patients developed either acute GVHD or chronic GVHD exacerbation within 3 months of their infection. One patient developed biopsy-proven acute GVHD (max grade III) 3 weeks after her infection and another patient developed a severe exacerbation of chronic GVHD within 3 months-both continue to require multi-modal IS. The remaining 7 patients with chronic GVHD have been maintained on either stable or tapered IS. Conclusions: Given the effect of COVID-19 infection, its impact on HCT recipients is important to define. The majority of HCT patients who contracted moderate-critical COVID-19 infections in our study were either on IS or had significant comorbidities. Our observational data points to the importance of long-term follow-up in HCT patients. Future studies are needed to delineate whether there is a relationship between COVID-19 infection and GVHD development or exacerbation.

Consequently, considerable effort has been invested in developing more evolutionarily robust vaccines, either by targeting highly conserved components of the pathogen (universal vaccines) or by including multiple immunological targets within a single vaccine (multi-epitope vaccines). An unexplored third possibility is to vaccinate individuals with one of a number of qualitatively different vaccines, creating a ‘mosaic’ of individual immunity in the population. Here we explore whether a mosaic vaccination strategy can deliver superior epidemiological outcomes to ‘conventional’ vaccination, in which all individuals receive the same vaccine. We suppose vaccine doses can be distributed between distinct vaccine ‘targets’ (e.g., different surface proteins against which an immune response can be generated) and/or immunologically-distinct variants at these targets (e.g., strains); the pathogen can undergo antigenic evolution at both targets. Using simple mathematical models, we show that mosaic vaccination often outperforms conventional vaccination, leading to fewer infected individuals, improved vaccine efficacy, and lower individual risks over the course of the epidemic.","McLeod, David V.; Wahl, Lindi M.; Mideo, Nicole",bioRxiv,72,5

In some hospitals face-to-face clinic consultations have significantly reduced, being replaced by virtual clinics where possible. We hypothesised that virtual follow up of many of our Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients could continue indefinitely without impacting on the quality of clinical care, with the overall benefits of maintaining patient safety and convenience, and reduced costs for the hospital. Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate physician consultations in our HCM clinic prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to determine what proportion of consultations resulted in patients developing new symptoms or requiring medication changes. We further looked to see if we could identify any patient factors that would allow us to predict which patients would be most suitable for future virtual follow up. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the electronic patient records of HCM patients seen in the dedicated Inherited Cardiac Conditions (ICC) clinic for follow-up over a 6-month period in 2018. Patients were classified into high (≥6%), moderate (4-5.9%) and low (&lt;4%) risk groups according to ESC-SCD risk score. Transthoracic echocardiogram and cardiac magnetic resonance features were reviewed. The outcome comprised number of patients developing new symptoms or requiring medication change, as well as hospital admissions for cardiovascular reasons (e.g. angina, arrhythmia, and heart failure) in the 2-years following clinic consultation. Results Forty-seven HCM patients (mean age 61.4 ± 12.2, 55% male) were identified and reviewed from the ICC clinic. Overall, 36% of patients had interventions from the face-to-face clinic;with 21% of patients developing new symptoms and 32% of patients requiring medication changes. There were 38 low-risk, 4 moderate-risk and 4 high-risk patients. 1 patient was not eligible for the risk stratification due to age over 80. 21% of low-risk, 25% of moderate-risk and 25% of high-risk patients developed new symptoms (table 1). Over 50% of patients who had a moderate- high ESC-SCD risk score or echocardiographic evidence of systolic/diastolic impairment required medication changes (table 1 & 2). Only 2 patients had hospital admissions for cardiovascular reasons in the 2-year follow up period, and those with systolic/diastolic impairment also incur high rates of admissions (table 2). Conclusion About 60% of HCM patients from our inherited conditions clinic were asymptomatic and did not require changes in medication, which suggests that this group would be very suitable for virtual follow-up clinic appointments postpandemic. Potential predictive factors would include patients with low ESC-SCD risk score and without left ventricular impairment. Hospital costs may be reduced whilst maintaining patient safety and convenience. HCM patient satisfaction with virtual consultations would be a further area to examine in relation to this.","Luo, E.; Chan, K.; Tilling, L.; Balkhausen, K.; Bull, S.",Heart,72,16

We have developed the smartphone Neurological Function Tests Suite (NeuFun-TS) and are systematically evaluating their psychometric properties against the gold-standard of complete neurological examination digitalized into NeurExTM App. This paper examines the fifth, and thus far the most complex NeuFun-TS test, the ""Spiral tracing"". We generated 40 features in the training cohort (22 healthy donors [HD] and 105 multiple sclerosis [MS] patients) and compared their intraclass correlation coefficient, fold-change between HD and MS and correlations with relevant clinical and imaging outcomes. We assembled the best features into machine-learning models and examined their performance in the independent validation cohort (56 MS patients). We show that by aggregating multiple neurological functions, complex tests such as spiral tracing are susceptible to intra-individual variations, decreasing their reproducibility and thus, clinical utility. Simple tests, reproducibly measuring single function(s) that can be aggregated to increase sensitivity are preferable in app design.","Messan, K. S.; Pham, L. K.

The issue of intellectual property rights becomes more obvious in this new mode of trade than in others. China's ""14th Five-Year Plan"" marked the beginning to implement the strategy of the intellectual property rights for a powerful country. Through the law-and-economics analysis, this paper analyzes the research reports of China's Intellectual Property Court and American Chamber of Commerce, and finds it essential for the cross-border e-commerce to attach great importance to the risk control and protection of property rights. After the analysis and research, on the possible risk of intellectual property rights faced by cross-border e-commerce, it is proposed that enterprises must not only pay attention to but also actively identify and conduct risk warning of the legal risks of their own intellectual property rights as well as the causes of them, so as to put forward corresponding risk control measures and construct prevention and protection mechanisms.","Zhou, B.

The primary task of developing such a human-centered system is to accurately understand human behavior. In this paper, we propose a fog computing framework for assembly operation recognition, which brings computing power close to the data source in order to achieve real-time recognition. For data collection, the operator's activity is captured using visual cameras from different perspectives. For operation recognition, instead of directly building and training a deep learning model from scratch, which needs a huge amount of data, transfer learning is applied to transfer the learning abilities to our application. A worker assembly operation dataset is established, which at present contains 10 sequential operations in an assembly task of installing a desktop CNC machine. The developed transfer learning model is evaluated on this dataset and achieves a recognition accuracy of 95% in the testing experiments.","Tao, Wenjin; Al-Amin, Md; Chen, Haodong; Leu, Ming C.; Yin, Zhaozheng; Qin, Ruwen",Procedia Manufacturing,72,19

Although there is international cooperation on the conceptual level, individual countries are responsible for the actual implementation of counter hybrid measures. This article compares the approaches of Finland, Germany and the Netherlands to counter hybrid threats, while taking into consideration their strategic culture. It shows that the countries differ in their approach to counter hybrid threats in terms of their organisation of security and the scope of measures taken to deter adversaries. These differences are mainly rooted in historical, institutional and political processes. The countries are rather similar in detecting hybrid threats and responding to hybrid attacks, which can be explained by the nature of hybrid threats. Consequently, strategic culture is a context that shapes but not ultimately determines how Finland, Germany and the Netherlands counter hybrid threats. The results of this article suggest that our current understanding of strategic culture is insufficient to describe and explain an actor’s security policy in the contemporary security environment. It is recommended that the concept of strategic culture should be revised and has to be examined more broadly by including national security issues and a broad spectrum of instruments of power.

Although, several efforts are ongoing for accurate forecasting of cases, deaths, and hospitalization at various resolutions, few have been attempted for college campuses despite their potential to become COVID-19 hot-spots. In this paper, we present a real-time effort towards weekly forecasting of campus-level cases during the fall semester for four universities in Virginia, United States. We discuss the challenges related to data curation. A causal model is employed for forecasting with one free time-varying parameter, calibrated against case data. The model is then run forward in time to obtain multiple forecasts. We retrospectively evaluate the performance and, while forecast quality suffers during the campus reopening phase, the model makes reasonable forecasts as the fall semester progresses. We provide sensitivity analysis for the several model parameters. In addition, the forecasts are provided weekly to various state and local agencies.","Hurt, B.; Adiga, A.; Marathe, M.; Barrett, C.",,72,16

This situation forced academic institutions to modify the evaluation format of students. The use of proctoring systems quickly became widespread, although some controversies arose. The two main discussions regarding these systems are the integrity of the assessment and the capacity of the students to adapt to this new assessment method, without changes in theirs scores. To elucidate two controversies, we have analyzed the preferences and the scores obtained from a trial of 660 scores from 332 students of the third grade of Veterinary Medicine. The experiment involved three modalities of exam: an online format from home using the Respondus Lockdown Browser system (Modality 1), online in person using the Respondus Lockdown Browser system with the supervision of a teacher (Modality 2), or paper format in person with the supervision of a teacher (Modality 3). The results obtained showed that the students preferred Modality 1 (online at home with Respondus Lockdown Browser system). No statistical differences between the scores obtained by students were found between the three modalities analyzed. The proctoring system is a good method to adjudicate exams in higher education institutions, and the scores of students are similar to those obtained through traditional evaluation and control systems.","Marín García, Pablo-Jesús Arnau-Bonachera Alberto Llobat Lola",Education Sciences,72,1

Uncovering these inter-kingdom cross-talks propels our understanding of disease pathogenesis, and provides useful leads on potential therapeutic targets. Despite the biological significance of microbe-host interactions, there is a big gap in understanding the downstream effects of these interactions on host processes. Computational methods are expected to fill this gap by generating, integrating and prioritizing predictions - as experimental detection remains challenging due to feasibility issues. Here, we present MicrobioLink, a computational pipeline to integrate predicted interactions between microbial and host proteins together with host molecular networks. Using the concept of network diffusion, MicrobioLink can analyse how microbial proteins in a certain context are influencing cellular processes by modulating gene or protein expression. We demonstrated the applicability of the pipeline using a case study. We used gut metaproteomic data from Crohn’s disease patients and healthy controls to uncover the mechanisms by which the microbial proteins can modulate host genes which belong to biological processes implicated in disease pathogenesis.

While computer science also commonly studies accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, their policy implications remain poorly examined.

We focus our analysis on distributed machine learning systems. Understanding the policy implications in this area is particularly urgent because such systems, which include autonomous vehicles, tend to be high-stakes and safety-critical. We 1) describe how the trade-off takes shape for these systems, 2) highlight gaps between existing US risk assessment standards and what these systems require to be properly assessed, and 3) make specific calls to action to facilitate accountability when hypothetical risks concerning the accuracy-efficiency trade-off become realized as accidents in the real world.

In total, 1,290 students and five lecturers participated in the survey from five universities in Nigeria. To supplement the data from the questionnaire, the five LIS lecturers were engaged in an interview. Findings - The study found that Zoom and WhatsApp were used by the lecturers to deliver lectures to their students. Lecturers are always available, the opportunity to store lectures and files for re-use at convenience, allows for collaborative learning, sharing learning materials, freedom in asking lecturer questions and conducive learning at home were mentioned as some of the benefits of receiving an online lecture. Some challenges associated with electronic teaching and learning were also identified. The LIS lecturers interviewed mentioned some benefits and challenges of engaging in electronic teaching during the period of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. Practical implications - The research offered educators an additional method for teaching and learning in situations where physical contacts are not possible. Because electronic learning platforms are free and can be used at liberty, they require self-discipline and more responsibility from students and lecturers, which might be a challenge. It requires lecturers to generate new skills, be cognitively sensitive and well-sequenced. Social implications - Teacher/students relationship can be improved significantly with the use of social media platforms for teaching and learning. Originality/value - The study reported the use of social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Zoom in the teaching/learning process in the university system in a developing country context.","Okeji, C.

Logistical disadvantages, ethical constraints, costs and high execution times could have a negative impact on the execution of the clinical trial. Rapid innovation in health and health care technologies, interventions, and products require the proliferation of rigorous clinical trials to evaluate their efficacy and effectiveness. To meet these needs, the field has been slowly moving toward increasing adoption of virtual clinical trials. VCTs use tech devices and social engagement platforms to conduct trials from a patient’s home. These electronic processes offer new opportunities for a patient-centric approach to clinical research.

Although promising, the high variability of the radio propagation channel for ISM-band technologies suggests that a deep analysis of BLE is needed in order to isolate the different propagation factors. In this paper we show, through extensive measurements, the fluctuation of BLE channel in various environments and provide a ray tracing model to fully capture the BLE channel behavior. Results show how unpredictable BLE measurements become at increasing distances and under different positioning configurations, leading to misleading detections for contact tracing apps.

Neuronanomedicine investigates nanotechnology strategies to target the brain and improve the therapeutic outcome in NDs. Two-dimensional adherent cell BBB models show substantial phenogenomic heterogeneity and their ability to predict the permeability of molecules and nanoparticles into the brain is extremely limited. Thus, the high-throughput screening of CNS nanomedicines relies on the use of animal models. To address this dearth, 3D organoids that mimic the in vivo physiology are under development. Still, there exist concerns about the standardization and scale-up of the production process, their proper characterisation, and their industrial application. In this work, we report on a novel multicellular organoid of the neurovascular blood–brain barrier (NV-BBB) that recapitulates the regulated syncytium of human endothelial cells and the function of the human BBB. For this, an advanced organoid comprising human brain microvascular endothelial cells, brain vascular pericytes and human astrocytes combined with primary neurons and microglia isolated from neonate rats is bio-fabricated without the use of an extracellular matrix. The structure and function are fully characterized by confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy, light sheet fluorescence microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, cryogenic-scanning electron microscopy, western blotting, RNA-sequencing and quantitative gene expression by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. This bulk of these self-assembloids is comprised of neural cells and microglia and the surface covered by endothelial cells that act as a biological barrier that resembles the BBB endothelium. In addition, the formation of neuron-microglia morphofunctional communication sites is confirmed. Analysis of key transcriptomic expressions show the up-regulation of selected BBB-related genes including tight junction proteins, solute carriers, transporters of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily, metabolic enzymes, and prominent basement membrane signatures. Results confirmed the more efficient cell-cell communication in 3D organoids made of multiple neural-tissue cells than in 2D endothelial cell monocultures. These multicellular organoids are utilized to screen the permeability of different polymeric, metallic, and ceramic nanoparticles. Results reveal penetration through different mechanisms such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis and distribution patterns in the organoid that depend on the nanoparticle type, highlighting the promise of this simple, reproducible and scalable multicellular NV-BBB organoid platform to investigate the BBB permeability of different nanomaterials in nanomedicine, nanosafety, and nanotoxicology.","Kumarasamy, Murali; Sosnik, Alejandro",bioRxiv,72,16

We tested whether there is a long-term mortality difference between sexes for other microbes (viral and bacterial) response burden among older people. Methods: Seven-year follow-up study consisted of 382 home-dwelling people aged 75-90 years (65.2% females) with a history cardiovascular disease. At baseline, serum immunoglobulin G antibodies were assayed against herpesviruses (CMV, HSV-1 and HSV-2) and bacteria (Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and Helicobacter pylori). Titers were summed up as herpes (HB) or bacterial response burden (BB) and divided into tertiles. Hazard ratios (HR) of total mortality with 95% CIs were calculated using Cox regression. Results: The overall HB was lower and BB higher among males than females (P<0.001). There was a significant sex/HB (P=0.01) and sex/BB (P=0.03) interaction with mortality. Multivariable-adjusted (age, body mass index, C-reactive protein, and comorbidity index) mortality HRs for increasing HB sex-specific tertiles were 1.0 (reference), 1.34 (95% CI 0.62-2.88), and 2.66 (1.25-5.64) for males and 1.0, 1.30 (0.76-2.21), and 1.30 (0.77-2.22) for females. The significant age-adjusted association between BB and mortality in males attenuated after multivariable adjustments, HR (top-vs-bottom tertile) 1.74 (0.93-3.25). In females, no association with BB was observed. Using HB and BB as continuous variables supported the findings with tertiles. Conclusions: Although being lower in older males than females, higher Herpesviridae response burden was associated with increased 7-year mortality risk among males, not among females. Immune responses to common microbes may contribute to sex differences in longevity and mortality.","Strandberg, T.; Seppanen, M.; Pitkala, K.; Kivimaki, M.; Tienari, P.",,72,20

In order to explore the repercussions of contagion prevention and community engagement initiatives such as deploying face masks and visualizing Covid-19 statistics, we resorted to an ethical model of Design for Responsible innovation (DRI). This interactive model is useful for identifying, exploring, and describing analytical and generative paths of inquiry departing from, or arriving at, diverse matters of concern such as the impact of commodification and manufacturing in society and nature, the relativism of truth, the segregation of identities, and the reduction of agency. In this paper we argue that the human-centered perspective on design relies on a biased value system that either disfavors some social groups or disregards nonhuman living agencies, and we emphasize the analytical capacity of the model to chart and rationalize alternative inquiry paths. In consequence, future responsible design interventions would benefit from positioning life at center stage and embracing the relational and dependent nature of human beings from a posthuman perspective.

The study proposes to approach Brian Friel's Dancing at Lughnasa (1990) from a post-postmodern perspective, to trace Friel's lifelong quest for belief. The juxtaposition of Catholic ideals, Irish Celtic myths and African tribal rituals in Lughnasa, demonstrates Friel's complicated attitude towards religion. The study also introduces performatism, a new cultural theory coined by Raoul Eshelman in 2000, as a suggested post postmodern paradigm for the new epoch. The focus will be on the ""aesthetic belief"", a pivotal ideal in performatism. It is based on the technique of double frames in which the author originates a state of compulsory mediated belief by enclosing the reader/audience into outer and inner frames. The study reveals that Lughnasa which represents the culmination of Friel's lifelong quest for faith, transcends the limited experience of aesthetic belief in Eshelman's theory, into a more universal aesthetics of belief.

Why diabetic individuals are more prone to develop severe COVID-19 remains unclear. Here, we established a novel human kidney organoid model that mimics early hallmarks of diabetic nephropathy. High oscillatory glucose exposure resulted in metabolic changes, expansion of extracellular membrane components, gene expression changes determined by scRNAseq, and marked upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, hyperglycemic conditions lead to markedly higher viral loads in kidney organoids compared to normoglycemia. Genetic deletion of ACE2, but not of the candidate receptor BSG/CD147, in kidney organoids demonstrated the essential role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infections and completely prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection in the diabetogenic microenvironment. These data introduce a novel organoid model for diabetic kidney disease and show that diabetic-induced ACE2 licenses the diabetic kidney to enhanced SARS-CoV-2 replication.","Garreta, Elena; Prado, Patricia; Stanifer, Megan; Monteil, Vanessa; del Pozo, Carmen Hurtado; Ullate-Agote, Asier; Vilas-Zornoza, Amaia; Romero, Juan Pablo; Jonsson, Gustav; Oria, Roger; Leopoldi, Alexandra; Hagelkruys, Astrid; Moya-Rull, Daniel; González, Federico; Marco, Andrés; Tarantino, Carolina; Domingo-Pedrol, Pere; HasanAli, Omar; Ventura-Aguiar, Pedro; María Campistol, Josep; Prosper, Felipe; Mirazimi, Ali; Boulant, Steeve; Penninger, Josef M.; Montserrat, Nuria",bioRxiv,72,24

MATERIALS AND METHODS A 50-year-old man presented with 38 mm right adrenal incidentaloma, functionally nonactive and without radiologic characteristics suggestive of a malignant lesion, discovered on abdominal computed tomography for nephrolithiasis. The single access adrenalectomy was attempted with multichannel SILS port (Covidien), inserted through a 3 cm transverse incision at the tip of rib XII on the right side. RESULTS The single access retroperitoneal adrenalectomy (SARA) was successfully completed without any intraoperative complications. An additional lateral 5-mm port was needed for retraction of the kidney and for tubular drain in the end stage of the surgery. The operating time was 120 minutes with 40 mL of blood loss. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the second postoperative day. Pathologic examination confirmed cortical adenoma of the adrenal grand. No morbidity within one month of follow-up, and excellent cosmetic results. CONCLUSION This is the first case of a single access retroperitoneal adrenalectomy (SARA) by using SILS port was performed in our country. Based on our primary experience, we believe that SARA is a safe and feasible procedure for selected patients with adrenal tumors and when performed by a surgeon experienced in laparoscopic and adrenal surgery. Although initial technical adjustments are inevitable, simplifying the procedure. However, more surgical experience using this technique is required to confirm our initial impressions.","Todorov, G; Grozdev, K; Koichev, A",Khirurgiia,72,12

AIM: Inform about risks of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in patients with severe mental illness (SMI), patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD), and patients treated with clozapine. Advise on monitoring of clozapine plasma levels and white blood cell count and differential in COVID-19 and after vaccination, as well as measures to be taken. METHOD: Literature research and case studies. RESULTS: SMI patients and in particular SSD patients have an increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 with more hospitalizations and higher mortality than non-psychiatric patients. Patients using clozapine may be at greater risk of infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause a dangerous increase of clozapine plasma levels and generally mild and short-term granulocytopenia and lymphocytopenia, which are usually not a result of clozapine treatment. CONCLUSION: In case of COVID-19 extra alertness is required in patients with SMI and especially SSD. In clozapine users, in case of COVID-19, reduction in dose by half to three quarters of the original dose is recommended. When patients develop granulocytopenia, SARS-CoV-2 should be considered as the cause and not immediately clozapine. SMI patients and clozapine users in particular belong to a high risk group with a medical indication for early vaccination.","Veerman, S R T; Bogers, J P A M; Cohen, D; Schulte, P F J",Tijdschrift voor psychiatrie,72,28

The professionals' exposure to suspicious contacts often requires their confinement. The objective was to know the epidemiological characteristics of the primary care professionals who required confinement. METHODS The research was carried out in the North Metropolitan Primary Care Area of Barcelona, from February 17 to May 3, 2020. 1,418 professionals who required confinement due to the epidemic by Covid-19 participated. The reasons for confinement, symptomatology, the confinement time and the results of PCR tests results were recorded. Univariate descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS 78.8% of the professionals were women and the mean age was 45.2 years. 67.8% were doctors and nurses, in the remaining 32.2% there were different healthcare and non-care professionals. 64.1% of the sample presented symptoms compatible with Covid-19. Participants described multiple symptoms during confinement. 1,050 diagnostic RT- PCR tests were performed, being positive in 323 cases, of which 33 were in asymptomatic people. CONCLUSIONS The impact of the epidemic by Covid-19 is anticipated in health personnel compared to the general population. The distribution of symptoms in healthcare professionals is similar to that of other studies in the general population.

These social contacts include both ""close"" contacts and ""casual"" encounters among individuals in transport, leisure, shopping, etc. Knowing the first through the study of the social networks is not a difficult task, but having a clear picture of the network of casual contacts is a very hard problem in a society of increasing mobility. Here we assume, on the basis of several pieces of empirical evidence, that the casual contacts between two individuals are a function of their social distance in the network of close contacts. Then, we assume that we know the network of close contacts and infer the casual encounters by means of nonrandom long-range (LR) interactions determined by the social proximity of the two individuals. This approach is then implemented in a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model accounting for the spread of infections in complex networks. A parameter called ""conductance"" controls the feasibility of those casual encounters. In a zero conductance network only contagion through close contacts is allowed. As the conductance increases the probability of having casual encounters also increases. We show here that as the conductance parameter increases, the rate of propagation increases dramatically and the infection is less likely to die out. This increment is particularly marked in networks with scale-free degree distributions, where infections easily become epidemics. Our model provides a general framework for studying epidemic spreading in networks with arbitrary topology with and without casual contacts accounted for by means of LR interactions.","Estrada, Ernesto; Kalala-Mutombo, Franck; Valverde-Colmeiro, Alba","Physical review.

In combination with the research work of the author' s group, this paper briefly summaries the recent progresses in selection, screening and application of affinity ligands. A new screening method with antisense peptide based combinatorial peptide libraries has been developed to search the affinity ligands for target proteins and peptides. This strategy is simpler and more effective than the conventional combinatorial strategy. The work including syntheses and screening is greatly reduced and the structural determination of the ligands becomes easy by using this method.

METHODS We searched for information on ehealth services related to the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. The sources of information were mainstream search engines such as Baidu and the popular interactive social platforms such as Webchat. The keywords were ""Internet+pneumonia"", ""Internet clinic"", ""pneumonia online clinic"" and so on. The time of information was from January 20 to February 3, 2020. The key information was extracted and encoded by two persons back-to-back. The coding information included: name of organization provider, launching time, location of provider, service items, user, health workers engaging in the service, and so on. The coded information was entered and analyzed with SPSS 24.0 and Excel. RESULTS There were totally 57 projects launched by local governments, hospitals and IT companies. Most of them were launched from January 24th to 27th, the hospital and government projects services regionally, especially in eastern provinces. In this study, 90.48% of the enterprises and 100.00% of the hospitals had online fever clinic and consultation services for COVID-19, 66.67% of the enterprises and 37.04% of the hospitals serviced derivative health problems. Only a few projects provided tele-medical consultation. There were individual projects that provided online health management for home quarantine people. Physicians were the main force of various projects. In some hospital projects, there were also nurses, pharmacists and professional technicians to provide featured consultation. CONCLUSION Ehealth is useful and helpful for the health care system to rapidly cope with health demand during instantaneous and post epidemic time. Regional distribution of ehealth is unbalanced. There are institutional and technical feasibilities for the emergency application of Internet technology. However, community health centers seldom provide ehealth or connect with tertiary hospitals with Internet. Therefore, all kinds of providers within healthcare system should promote emergence ehealth. Tele-medical diagnosis and referral should be developed by local governments during COVID-19. The application of ""Internet+medical treatment"" in community medical institutions and synergy among various institutions should be promoted.","Feng, W; Zhang, L N; Li, J Y; Wei, T; Peng, T T; Zhang, D X; Guo, Z X; Wang, W S",Beijing da xue xue bao.

Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a novel candidate exacerbation biomarker identified by proteomic screening. OBJECTIVES To assess SAA as a biomarker of AECOPD. METHODS Biomarkers were assessed (1) cross-sectionally (stable vs. AECOPD; 62 individuals) and (2) longitudinally with repeated measures (baseline vs. AECOPD vs. convalescence; 78 episodes in 37 individuals). Event severity was graded (I, ambulatory; II, hospitalized; III, respiratory failure) based on consensus guidelines. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Presumptively newly acquired pathogens were associated with onset of symptomatic AECOPD. In the cross-sectional study, both SAA and C-reactive protein (CRP) were elevated at AECOPD onset compared with stable disease (SAA median, 7.7 vs. 57.6 mg/L; P < 0.01; CRP median, 4.6 vs. 12.5 mg/L; P < 0.01). Receiver operator characteristics analysis was used to generate area-under-curve values for event severity. SAA discriminated level II/III events (SAA, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-0.94 vs. CRP, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.87; P = 0.05). Combining SAA or CRP with major symptoms (Anthonisen criteria, dyspnea) did not further improve the prediction model for severe episodes. IL-6 and procalcitonin were not informative.

We conducted a sub-study to identify the communication channels by which HCPs preferred receiving public health alerts and advisories. METHODS Enrolled HCPs were blindly randomized into four message delivery groups to receive time-sensitive public health messages by e-mail, fax, or short message service (SMS) or to a no-message control group. Follow-up interviews were conducted 5-10 days after the message. In the final interview, additional questions were asked regarding HCP preferences for receiving public health alerts and advisories. We examined the relationship between key covariates and preferred method of receiving public health alert and advisory messages. RESULTS Gender, age, provider type, and study site showed statistically significant associations with delivery method preference. Older providers were more likely than younger providers to prefer e-mail or fax, while younger providers were more likely than older providers to prefer receiving messages via SMS. CONCLUSIONS There is currently no evidence-based research to guide or improve communication between public health agencies and HCPs. Understanding the preferences of providers for receiving alerts and advisories may improve the effectiveness of vital public health communications systems and, in turn, may enhance disease surveillance, aid in early detection, and improve case finding and situational awareness for public health emergencies.","Revere, Debra; Painter, Ian; Oberle, Mark; Baseman, Janet G",Public health reports,72,28

METHODS: We designed a prospective, randomized comparison between open and laparoscopic surgery for SAA. Primary end points were types of surgical procedures performed and clinical outcomes. Analysis was developed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were allocated to laparotomy (group A) and 15 to laparoscopy (group B). Groups displayed similar patient- and aneurysm-related characteristics. The conversion rate to open surgery was 13.3 %. The type of surgical procedure performed on the splenic artery was similar in the two groups: aneurysmectomy with splenic artery ligature or direct anastomosis was performed in 51 % and 21 % of patients in group A and in 60 % and 20 % in group B, respectively. The splenectomy rate was similar (14 % vs. 20 %). Postoperative splenic infarction was observed in one case in each group. Laparoscopy was associated with shorter procedures (p = 0.0003) and lower morbidity (25 % vs. 64 %, p = 0.045). Major morbidity requiring interventional procedures and blood transfusion was observed only in group A. Laparoscopy was associated with quicker resumption of oral diet (p < 0.001), earlier drain removal (p = 0.046), and shorter hospital stay (p < 0.01). During a mean follow-up of 50 months, two patients in group A required hospital readmission. In group B, two patients developed a late thrombosis of arterial anastomoses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that laparoscopy permits multiple technical options, does not increase the splenectomy rate, and reduces postoperative complications. It confirms the supposed clinical benefits of laparoscopy when ablative procedures are required but laparoscopic anastomoses show poor long-term results.","Tiberio, Guido A M; Bonardelli, Stefano; Gheza, Federico; Arru, Luca; Cervi, Edoardo; Giulini, Stefano M",Surgical endoscopy,72,1

Survival analysis showed that the II genotype favorably affected 28-day survival (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-0.81; p = .007), whereas ARDS caused by hospital-acquired pneumonia had a negative effect (hazard ratio, 2.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-4.40; p = .008). The II genotype (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.87; p = .012) and ARDS caused by hospital-acquired pneumonia (hazard ratio, 2.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-3.68; p = .006) were also significant prognostic factors for the in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS The angiotensin-converting enzyme I/D polymorphism is a significant prognostic factor for the outcome of ARDS. Patients with the II genotype have a significantly better chance of survival. This study did not show an increased risk for ARDS in Chinese patients with the D allele.","Jerng, Jih-Shuin; Yu, Chong-Jen; Wang, Hao-Chien; Chen, Kuan-Yu; Cheng, Shih-Lung; Yang, Pan-Chyr",Critical care medicine,72,5

The recombinant virus showed somewhat-reduced pathogenicity compared to the parental lentogenic LaSota strain but effectively elicited hemagglutination inhibition antibodies against NDV and protected chickens against lethal challenge with virulent NDV/CA02. IBV heterotypic protection was assessed using a prime-boost approach with a commercially available attenuated IBV Massachusetts (Mass)-type vaccine. Specific-pathogen-free chickens primed ocularly with rLS/IBV.S2 at 4 days of age and boosted with Mass at 18 days of age were completely protected against challenge at 41 days of age with a virulent Ark-type strain. In a second experiment, we compared protection conferred by priming with rLS/IBV.S2 and boosting with Mass (rLS/IBV.S2+Mass) versus priming and boosting with Mass (Mass+Mass). We also modified the timing of vaccination to prime at 1 day of age and boost at 12 days of age. Challenge with virulent Ark was performed at 21 days of age. Based on clinical signs, both vaccinated groups appeared equally protected against challenge compared to unvaccinated challenged chickens. Viral loads in lachrymal fluids of birds receiving rLS/IBV.S2+Mass showed a clear tendency of improved protection compared to Mass+Mass; however, the difference did not achieve statistical significance. A significant difference (P < 0.05) was determined between these groups regarding incidence of detection of challenge IBV RNA in the trachea; viral RNA was detected in 50% of rLS/IBV.S2+Mass-vaccinated chickens while chickens vaccinated with Mass+Mass and unvaccinated challenged controls showed 84 and 90% incidence of IBV RNA detection in the trachea, respectively. These results demonstrate that overexposing the IBV S2 to the chicken immune system by means of a vectored vaccine, followed by boost with whole virus, protects chickens against IBV showing dissimilar S1.","Toro, Haroldo; Zhao, Wei; Breedlove, Cassandra; Zhang, Zhenyu; Yu, Qingzhong; Van Santen, Vicky",Avian diseases,72,19

In cultured epithelial cells, they are released in a polarized fashion; depending on the virus and cell type, they are sorted preferentially either to the apical domain or to the basolateral plasma membrane domain. In this study, we investigated the role of the coronavirus spike protein, because of its prominent position in the virion the prime sorting candidate, in the directionality of virus release. Three independent approaches were taken. (i) The inhibition of N glycosylation by tunicamycin resulted in the synthesis of spikeless virions. The absence of spikes, however, did not influence the polarity in the release of virions. Thus, murine hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) was still secreted from the basolateral membranes of mTAL and LMR cells and from the apical sides of MDCK(MHVR) cells, whereas transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was still released from the apical surfaces of LMR cells. (ii) Spikeless virions were also studied by using the MHV-A59 temperature-sensitive mutant Albany 18. When these virions were produced in infected LMR and MDCK(MHVR) cells at the nonpermissive temperature, they were again preferentially released from basolateral and apical membranes, respectively. (iii) We recently demonstrated that coronavirus-like particles resembling normal virions were assembled and released when the envelope proteins M and E were coexpressed in cells (H. Vennema, G.-J. Godeke, J. W. A. Rossen, W. F. Voorhout, M. C. Horzinek, D.-J. E. Opstelten, and P. J. M. Rottier, EMBO J. 15:2020-2028, 1996). The spikeless particles produced in mTAL cells by using recombinant Semliki Forest viruses to express these two genes of MHV-A59 were specifically released from basolateral membranes, i.e., with the same polarity as that of wild-type MHV-A59. Our results thus consistently demonstrate that the spike protein is not involved in the directional sorting of coronaviruses in epithelial cells. In addition, our observations with tunicamycin show that contrary to the results with some secretory proteins, the N-linked oligosaccharides present on the viral M proteins of coronaviruses such as TGEV also play no role in viral sorting. The implications of these conclusions are discussed.","Rossen, J W; de Beer, R; Godeke, G J; Raamsman, M J; Horzinek, M C; Vennema, H; Rottier, P J",Journal of virology,72,28

In this large renal retrospective cohort study, we investigated whether frailer COVID-19 positive renal patients had worse outcomes. Design: All SARS-Cov-2 positive renal patients aged ≥18 years who presented to the emergency department at the Royal Free Hospital or at the satellite dialysis centres from 10th of March until the 10th of May 2020, with recent data on frailty, were included. The follow up was until 26th of May 2020. Age, gender, ethnicity, body mass index, chronic kidney disease stage, modality of renal replacement therapy, co-morbidities, Rockwood clinical frailty score (CFS), C reactive protein and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte count were collected at presentation. The primary outcome was the overall mortality rate following COVID-19 diagnosis. Secondary outcomes included the need for hospital admission. Results: A total of 200 renal patients were SARS-Cov-2 positive. In the 174 patients who had a CFS recorded, the age was 65.4 years ± 15.8 (mean ± SD) and 57,5% were male. At the end of follow up, 26% had died. Frail patients (CFS 5-7) were more than three times more likely to die compared to less frail patients (CFS of 1-4) (odds ratio (OR) 3.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-10.6). 118 patients (68%) required admission, but there was no difference in hospital admission rates for frail vs non-frail patients (OR 0.6, CI 0.3-1.7).

In this system, the MIC of arabinosylhypoxanthine (ara-Hx), the major in vivo metabolic derivative of ara-A, is 75 mug/ml. Inhibition of cytopathic effects of herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1) in microtiter wells of RK-13 cells varies directly with the concentrations of ara-A or ara-Hx, and inversely with residual HSV-1. The MIC of ara-A for HSV-1 in RK-13 cells is 5-20 times lower than similar measures with vero renal, mouse embryo, or human foreskin cultures. With RK-13 tissue cultures in microtiter plates, an assay for ""ara-A equivalents"" in human body fluids was developed which compares in sensitivity with high pressure liquid chromatography and has the advantage of simultaneously measuring combined antiherpesvirus effects of ara-A and its major metabolic derivative, ara-Hx. In vitro checkerboard studies in RK-13 cells confirmed that ara-A and ara-Hx in combination had antiviral effects which are synergistic. The total of the fractional MIC of ara-A plus ara-Hx in combination also varies inversely with residual HSV-1 in microtiter wells. Because virus adsorption is complete at 2 h before specimens to be tested are added in this assay, and because human interferon is not measured in rabbit cells, the antiviral assay is not affected by the presence of type-specific antiherpesvirus antibody or human interferon.Antiviral activity (AVA) was assayed as ara-A equivalents in sera and urines from 10 patients with serious herpesvirus infections who received 2.5-20 mg/kg daily of ara-A by intramuscular or intravenous routes. When a dosage schedule of 10 mg/kg per day or more was used, sustained concentrations of AVA that ranged from 0.8 to 14.4 mug/ml were found. When an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase (covidarabine) was not added to the specimens, mean serum concentrations were congruent with3.0 mug/ml (10 mg/kg per day, i.v.), and 4.1 mug/ml (20 mg/kg per day). However, in a single patient given 20 mg/kg of ara-A daily with covidarabine immediately added to the sera, the mean concentration of AVA was 12.9 mug/ml. Urines contained even higher AVA. Assays of 19 sera were performed both by microbiologic assay for AVA and by high pressure liquid chromatography for ara-A and ara-Hx. AVA was greater by microbiologic assay, and was greater than that which could be accounted for by stoichiometric chromatographic measures of ara-A and ara-Hx. These results with sera of treated patients are consistent both with the in vitro synergy of ara-A and ara-Hx found by checkerboard titrations, and with the beneficial responses to ara-A of patients with herpesvirus infections reported here and elsewhere.","Champney, K J; Lauter, C B; Bailey, E J; Lerner, A M",The Journal of clinical investigation,72,8

A Renilla luciferase (Rluc) gene was fused in-frame with the open reading frame of a subgenomic replicon in the position where the viral structural region was deleted, resulting in RlucRep. Transfection of BHK cells with RlucRep RNA yielded two distinctive Rluc signal peaks, one between 2 and 10 h and the other after 26 h posttransfection. By contrast, only the 2- to 10-h Rluc signal peak was observed in cells transfected with a mutant replicon containing an inactivated viral polymerase NS5 (RlucRep-NS5mt). Immunofluorescence and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assays showed that the levels of viral protein expression and RNA replication increased in cells transfected with the RlucRep but not in those transfected with the RlucRep-NS5mt. These results suggest that the Rluc signal that occurred at 2 to 10 h posttransfection reflects viral translation of the input replicon, while the Rluc activity after 26 h posttransfection represents RNA replication. Using this system, we showed that mutations of conserved sequence (CS) elements within the 3' untranslated region of the mosquito-borne flaviviruses did not significantly affect WNV translation but severely diminished or completely abolished RNA replication. Mutations of CS1 that blocked the potential base pairing with a conserved sequence in the 5' region of the capsid gene (5'CS) abolished RNA replication. Restoration of the 5'CS-CS1 interaction rescued viral replication. Replicons containing individual deletions of CS2, repeated CS2 (RCS2), CS3, or RCS3 were viable, but their RNA replication was dramatically compromised. These results demonstrate that genome cyclization through the 5'CS-CS1 interaction is essential for WNV RNA replication, whereas CS2, RCS2, CS3, and RCS3 facilitate, but are dispensable for, WNV replication.","Lo, Michael K; Tilgner, Mark; Bernard, Kristen A; Shi, Pei-Yong",Journal of virology,72,1

Over 75% of EIDs affecting humans are, or were originally, zoonoses (infectious diseases transmitted from animals to humans). There are two main ways by which infectious diseases can emerge: by changes in their geographical ranges and by adaptive emergence, a genetic change in a microorganism that results in it becoming capable of invading a new niche, often by jumping to a new host species such as humans. Diseases can appear to emerge simply because we become capable of detecting and diagnosing them. Management of EID events is a key role of public health globally and a considerable challenge for clinical care. Increasingly, emphasis is being placed on predicting EID occurrence to ""get ahead of the curve"" - that is, allowing health systems to be poised to respond to them, and public health to be ready to prevent them. Predictive models estimate where and when EIDs may occur and the levels of risk they pose. Evaluation of the internal and external drivers that trigger emergence events is increasingly considered in predicting EID events. Currently, global changes are driving increasing occurrence of EIDs, but our capacity to prevent and deal with them is also increasing. Web-based scanning and analysis methods are increasingly allowing us to detect EID outbreaks, modern genomics and bioinformatics are increasing our ability to identify their genetic and geographical origins, while developments in geomatics and earth observation will enable more real-time tracking of outbreaks. EIDs will, however, remain a key, global public health challenge in a globalized world where demographic, climatic, and other environmental changes are altering the interactions between hosts and pathogen in ways that increase spillover from animals to humans and global spread.","Ogden, N H; AbdelMalik, P; Pulliam, Jrc",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,72,33

There where no differences observed in the baseline QTc between cases and controls: 414.8ms (49.2) vs 416.5ms (29.4), (p=0.716). Baseline long QT was observed in 2/11 cases and 2/22. Among cases, 10/11 (90.9%) received hydroxychloroquine, mainly associated with azithromycin (8/11; 72.7%), 3 received lopinavir/ritonavir and one remdesivir. The median increase in QTc after 72 hours under treatment was 28.9 ms [IQR 48.7] (p=0.062). 4/11 (36.4%) patients had a long QTc at 72 hours, resulting in 3 patients &#8805;500ms; treatment was stopped in one (QTc 510ms) but ventricular arrhythmias were not documented. CONCLUSIONS: The use of antivirals caused an increase on the QTc interval after 72 hours of treatment, being the QTc long in 36.3% of the patients, although no arrhythmic events were observed. The use of hydroxychloroquine and antivirals requires active QTc monitoring and it is recommended to discontinue treatment if QTc >500ms.","Esmel-Vilomara, Roger; Dolader, Paola; Sabaté-Rotes, Anna; Soriano-Arandes, Antoni; Gran, Ferran; Rosés-Noguer, Ferran",,72,24

People in many nations have lost their livelihoods, it has severely impacted international relations and, most importantly, health infrastructures across the world have been tormented. This pandemic has already left footprints on human psychology, traits, and priorities and is certainly going to lead towards a new world order in the future. As always, science and technology have come to the rescue of the human race. The prevention of infection by instant and repeated cleaning of surfaces that are most likely to be touched in daily life and sanitization drives using medically prescribed sanitizers and UV irradiation of textiles are the first steps to breaking the chain of transmission. However, the real challenge is to develop and uplift medical infrastructure, such as diagnostic tools capable of prompt diagnosis and instant and economic medical treatment that is available to the masses. Two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene, are atomic sheets that have been in the news for quite some time due to their unprecedented electronic mobilities, high thermal conductivity, appreciable thermal stability, excellent anchoring capabilities, optical transparency, mechanical flexibility, and a unique capability to integrate with arbitrary surfaces. These attributes of 2D materials make them lucrative for use as an active material platform for authentic and prompt (within minutes) disease diagnosis via electrical or optical diagnostic tools or via electrochemical diagnosis. We present the opportunities provided by 2D materials as a platform for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.","Ranjan, Pranay; Thomas, Vinoy; Kumar, Prashant",,72,20

Here we used a mathematical model to characterize in detail the viral dynamics in 31 cynomolgus macaques for which nasopharyngeal and tracheal viral load were frequently assessed. We identified that infected cells had a large burst size (>104 virus) and a within-host reproductive basic number of approximately 6 and 4 in nasopharyngeal and tracheal compartment, respectively. After peak viral load, infected cells were rapidly lost with a half-life of 9 hours, with no significant association between cytokine elevation and clearance, leading to a median time to viral clearance of 10 days, consistent with observations in mild human infections. Given these parameter estimates, we predict that a prophylactic treatment blocking 90% of viral production or viral infection could prevent viral growth. In conclusion, our results provide estimates of SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetic parameters in an experimental model of mild infection and they provide means to assess the efficacy of future antiviral treatments.","Gonçalves, Antonio; Maisonnasse, Pauline; Donati, Flora; Albert, Mélanie; Behillil, Sylvie; Contreras, Vanessa; Naninck, Thibaut; Marlin, Romain; Solas, Caroline; Pizzorno, Andres; Lemaitre, Julien; Kahlaoui, Nidhal; Terrier, Olivier; Ho Tsong Fang, Raphael; Enouf, Vincent; Dereuddre-Bosquet, Nathalie; Brisebarre, Angela; Touret, Franck; Chapon, Catherine; Hoen, Bruno; Lina, Bruno; Rosa Calatrava, Manuel; de Lamballerie, Xavier; Mentré, France; Le Grand, Roger; van der Werf, Sylvie; Guedj, Jérémie",PLoS Comput Biol,72,4

The clinical presentation of this virus mainly manifests in the respiratory system but may also lead to severe complications in the cardiovascular system. The global burden of COVID-19 has led to an unprecedented need to gain further insight into patient outcomes, management, and clinical practice. This review aims to provide an overview of the current literature on heart failure (HF) hospitalizations, management, and care pathways for supporting patients during and beyond this pandemic. A literature review of five areas of interest was conducted and included: (i) HF hospitalization; (ii) recognizing the needs and supporting HF patients during COVID-19; (iii) supporting rehabilitation services; (iv) transitioning to a telehealth framework; and (v) the need for evidence. Patients with new-onset or existing HF are particularly vulnerable, but a significant reduction in HF hospital admissions has been reported. During these periods of uncertainty, the current care pathways for acute and elective cardiac patients have had to change with the relocation of HF services to protect the vulnerable and reduce transmission of COVID-19. Optimizing community HF services has the potential to reduce the pressures on secondary care during the recovery from this pandemic. Telemedicine and virtual health care are emerging technologies and overcome the risk of in-person exposure. Successful remote delivery of cardiac rehabilitation services has been reported during the pandemic. Delivery of a robust telehealth framework for HF patients will improve communication between clinician and patient. The reduction in HF admissions is a concern for the future and may result in unintended mortality. New-onset and current HF patients must understand their diagnosis and future prognosis and seek help and support using the appropriate platform when needed. Realigning HF services and the use of telemedicine and virtual health care has great potential but needs to be carefully understood to ensure engagement and approval in this population to overcome barriers and challenges.","Charman, Sarah J; Velicki, Lazar; Okwose, Nduka C; Harwood, Amy; McGregor, Gordon; Ristic, Arsen; Banerjee, Prithwish; Seferovic, Petar M; MacGowan, Guy A; Jakovljevic, Djordje G",ESC Heart Fail,72,16

Recently, various deep learning (DL) researches based on the EEG signals have been proposed to detect fatigue conditions. The research presented in this paper proposes an EEG classification system for DD based on DL networks. However, the proposed DD system is mainly realized into two procedures; (i) data acquisition and (ii) model analysis. For the data acquisition procedure, two key steps are considered, which are the signal collection using a wearable Emotiv EPOC+ headset to record 14 channels of EEG, and the signal annotation. Furthermore, a data augmentation (DA) step has been added to the proposed system to overcome the problem of over-fitting and to improve accuracy. As regards the model analysis, a comparative study is also introduced in this paper to argue the choice of DL architecture and frameworks used in our DD system. In this sense, The proposed DD protocol makes use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture implemented using the Keras library. The results showed a high accuracy value (90.42%) in drowsy/awake discrimination and revealed the efficiency of the proposed DD system compared to other research works.","Chaabene, Siwar; Bouaziz, Bassem; Boudaya, Amal; Hökelmann, Anita; Ammar, Achraf; Chaari, Lotfi",Sensors (Basel),72,1

The retreat included 152 high school-aged boys, counselors, and staff members from 21 states and territories and two foreign countries. All attendees were required to provide documentation of either a positive serologic test result* within the past 3 months or a negative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests result for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) &#8804;7 days before travel, to self-quarantine within their households for 7 days before travel, and to wear masks during travel. On July 15, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (WDHS) began an investigation after being notified that two students at the retreat had received positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results. WDHS offered RT-PCR testing to attendees on July 28 and serologic testing on August 5 and 6. Seventy-eight (51%) attendees received positive RT-PCR results (confirmed cases), and 38 (25%) met clinical criteria for COVID-19 without a positive RT-PCR result (probable cases). By the end of the retreat, 118 (78%) persons had received a positive serologic test result. Among 24 attendees with a documented positive serologic test result before the retreat, all received negative RT-PCR results. After RT-PCR testing on July 28, WDHS recommended that remaining susceptible persons (asymptomatic and with negative RT-PCR test results) quarantine from other students and staff members at the retreat. Recommended end dates for isolation or quarantine were based on established guidance (1,2) and determined in coordination with CDC. All attendees were cleared for interstate and commercial air travel to return home on August 11. This outbreak investigation documented rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, likely from a single student, among adolescents and young adults in a congregate setting. Mitigation plans that include prearrival quarantine and testing, cohorting, symptom monitoring, early identification and isolation of cases, mask use, enhanced hygiene and disinfection practices, and maximal outdoor programming are necessary to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in these settings (3,4).","Pray, Ian W; Gibbons-Burgener, Suzanne N; Rosenberg, Avi Z; Cole, Devlin; Borenstein, Shmuel; Bateman, Allen; Pevzner, Eric; Westergaard, Ryan P",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,72,30

We have built the COVID-19 Knowledge Extractor (COKE), a web application to extract, curate, and annotate essential drug-target relationships from the research literature on COVID-19 to assist drug repurposing efforts. Materials and Methods: SciBiteAI ontological tagging of the COVID Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), a repository of COVID-19 scientific publications, was employed to identify drug-target relationships. Entity identifiers were resolved through lookup routines using UniProt and DrugBank. A custom algorithm was used to identify co-occurrences of protein and drug terms, and confidence scores were calculated for each entity pair. Results: COKE processing of the current CORD-19 database identified about 3,000 drug-protein pairs, including 29 unique proteins and 500 investigational, experimental, and approved drugs. Some of these drugs are presently undergoing clinical trials for COVID-19. Discussion: The rapidly evolving situation concerning the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a dramatic growth of publications on this subject in a short period. These circumstances call for methods that can condense the literature into the key concepts and relationships necessary for insights into SARS-CoV-2 drug repurposing. Conclusion: The COKE repository and web application deliver key drug - target protein relationships to researchers studying SARS-CoV-2.

We hypothesized that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration could restore this redox homeostasis and suppress unfavorable evolution in Covid-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether NAC in high doses can avoid respiratory failure in patients with Covid-19. METHODS: It was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, unicentric trial, conducted at the Emergency Department of Hospital das Clínicas, São Paulo, Brazil. We enrolled 135 patients with severe Covid-19 (confirmed or suspected), with an oxyhemoglobin saturation of less than 94% or respiratory rate higher than 24 breaths/min. Patients were randomized to receive NAC 21 g (approximately 300 mg/kg) for 20 hours, or dextrose 5%. Primary endpoint was the need for mechanical ventilation. Secondary endpoints were time of mechanical ventilation, admission to ICU, time in ICU, and mortality. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were very similar in the two groups, with no significant difference in age, sex, comorbidities, medicines taken, and disease severity. Also, groups were similar in laboratory tests and chest CT scan findings. Sixteen patients (23.9%) in the Placebo group were submitted to endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, compared to 14 patients (20.6%) in the NAC group (p=0.675). No difference was observed in secondary endpoints. CONCLUSION: Administration of NAC in high doses did not affect the evolution of severe Covid-19.","de Alencar, Julio Cesar Garcia; Moreira, Claudia de Lucena; Müller, Alicia Dudy; Chaves, Cleuber Esteves; Fukuhara, Marina Akemi; da Silva, Elizabeth Aparecida; Miyamoto, Maria de Fátima Silva; Pinto, Vanusa Barbosa; Bueno, Cauê Gasparotto; Lazar, Felippe; Gomez, Luz Marina; Menezes, Maria Clara Saad; Marchini, Julio Flavio Meirelles; Marino, Lucas Oliveira; Brandão, Rodrigo Antônio; Souza, Heraldo Possolo",Clin Infect Dis,72,16

We find that the optimal policy is adaptive, with testing rates that depend on the epidemic state. Additionally, we show that such epidemic state is difficult to infer with molecular tests alone, which are highly sensitive but have a short detectability window. Instead, we propose the use of baseline serology testing, which is less sensitive but detects past infections, for the purpose of state estimation. Validation of such combined testing approach with a stochastic model of epidemics shows significant cost savings compared to non-adaptive testing strategies that are the current standard for COVID-19.","Acemoglu, D.; Fallah, A.; Giometto, A.; Huttenlocher, D.; Ozdaglar, A.; Parise, F.; Pattathil, S.",,72,1

The effectiveness of control measures such as contact reduction measures, closure of communities (lockdown), protective measures (social distancing, face mask wearing, and hand hygiene), and vaccination were modelled to examine possibilities for control of the disease under several protective vaccination levels in the population. Lockdown and contact reduction measures only delay the spread of the virus in the population because it resumes its previous dynamics as soon as the restrictions are lifted. Nevertheless, these measures are probably useful to avoid hospitals being overwhelmed in the short term. Our model predicted that 56% of the Spanish population would have been infected and subsequently recovered over a 130 day period if no protective measures were taken but this percentage would have been only 34% if protective measures had been put in place. Moreover, this percentage would have been further reduced to 41.7, 27.7, and 13.3% if 25, 50 and 75% of the population had been vaccinated, respectively. Finally, this percentage would have been even lower at 25.5, 12.1 and 7.9% if 25, 50 and 75% of the population had been vaccinated in combination with the application of protective measures, respectively.

Uncertainty about the duration of the pandemic and future contagion waves even led companies to view WFH as a 'new normal' way of working. Based on influence function regression methods, this paper explores the potential consequences in the labour income distribution related to a long-lasting increase in WFH feasibility among Italian employees. Results show that a positive shift in WFH feasibility would be associated with an increase in average labour income, but this potential benefit would not be equally distributed among employees. Specifically, an increase in the opportunity to WFH would favour male, older, high-educated, and high-paid employees. However, this 'forced innovation' would benefit more employees living in provinces have been more affected by the novel coronavirus. WFH thus risks exacerbating pre-existing inequalities in the labour market, especially if it will not be adequately regulated. As a consequence, this study suggests that policies aimed at alleviating inequality, like income support measures (in the short run) and human capital interventions (in the long run), should play a more important compensating role in the future.","Bonacini, Luca; Gallo, Giovanni; Scicchitano, Sergio",J Popul Econ,72,1

Objective: The primary objective was to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of implementing ARICA in a health system. Methods: 29 Black adults who self-reported ICS nonadherence, had uncontrolled persistent asthma, and a Duke Primary Care provider visit within the past 3 years were randomly assigned to intervention (N=15) or control (N=14) in a waitlist randomized controlled pilot trial. Participants were assigned to 1-3 ARICA components based on adherence barriers selected by participants;including, an asthma selfmanagement program, financial assistance referral program, and/or objective feedback on asthma control. All participants received weekly texts and emails dispelling asthma myths. Activities were delivered virtually due to COVID-19. Primary outcomes were feasibility (e.g., process outcomes) and acceptability (e.g., patient exit interviews) measured at 12 weeks. Secondary asthma (e.g., ACT) and adherence outcomes (e.g., DOSEnonadherence) were measured. Results: Most participants were female (N=27, 93%), nonsmokers (N=26, 70%), poorly controlled with ACT &lt;15 (N=14, 48%), and mean age 49.8. Most (N=14, 93%) completed all assigned intervention components and reported mean 4.8 of 5 on Weiner feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of intervention. The intervention group had a greater and statistically significant improvement in ACT (Δ-3.5, CI 6.0,0.96) and Marks AQLQ (Δ 11.5, CI 5.5,17.4) when compared to changes in the control ACT (Δ-2.5, CI-5.2,0.05) and Marks AQLQ (Δ5.7, CI-1.3,12.8), respectively. The improvement in ACT in the intervention group was clinically significant. The intervention group also reported a greater and statistically significant decrease in degree of nonadherence (DOSE Δ 0.74, CI 0.2,1.3) than control (DOSE Δ 0.36, CI-0.04,0.75) and a greater decrease in the number of adherence barriers identified in the intervention group (Δ 2.1, CI 1.2,3.0) versus control group (Δ1.6, CI 0.3,3.0). The study was not powered to assess a statistically significant change between groups. Conclusion: The implementation of ARICA in a cohort of Black adults was feasibly deployed in a health system and acceptable to participants. There was a trend in improvement in asthma control and asthma quality of life and a decrease in nonadherence and barriers to adherence.","Riley, I. L.; Jackson, B.; Olsen, M.; Svetkey, L.; Que, L.

The country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic is guided by the principle of Gross National Happiness (GNH), which prioritizes the well-being and happiness of people over conventional socioeconomic indicators. The king's leadership and government's decisions based on public health science helped in the control of the pandemic and reduce economic losses. The government implemented some unique and unconventional public health measures such as facility quarantine for those with high-risk exposure, an increase in quarantine period to 21 days, free testing and treatment, and population-based screening tests. Early and extensive contact tracing, extensive testing, effective communications, zoned travel restrictions, and adoption of physical distancing and hygiene measures limited COVID-19 transmissions within the country. Community participation from voluntary groups and civil society organizations helped deliver non-health services while hospitals provided uninterrupted routine health services through its primary healthcare network.

This diagnosis is challenging as most of the patients having COVID-19 infection stay asymptomatic while others showing symptoms are hard to distinguish from patients having different respiratory infections such as severe flu and Pneumonia. Due to cost and time-consuming wet-lab diagnostic tests for COVID-19, there is an utmost requirement for some alternate, non-invasive, rapid, and discounted automatic screening system. A chest CT scan can effectively be used as an alternative modality to detect and diagnose the COVID-19 infection. In this study, we present an automatic COVID-19 diagnostic and severity prediction system called COVIDC (COVID-19 detection using CT scans) that uses deep feature maps from the chest CT scans for this purpose. Our newly proposed system not only detects COVID-19 but also predicts its severity by using a two-phase classification approach (COVID vs non-COVID, and COVID-19 severity) with deep feature maps and different shallow supervised classification algorithms such as SVMs and random forest to handle data scarcity. We performed a stringent COVIDC performance evaluation not only through 10-fold cross-validation and an external validation dataset but also in a real setting under the supervision of an experienced radiologist. In all the evaluation settings, COVIDC outperformed all the existing state-of-the-art methods designed to detect COVID-19 with an F1 score of 0.94 on the validation dataset and justified its use to diagnose COVID-19 effectively in the real setting by classifying correctly 9 out of 10 COVID-19 CT scans.

With the advances in computer algorithms and especially Artificial Intelligence, the detection of this type of virus in the early stages will help in fast recovery and help in releasing the pressure off healthcare systems. In this paper, a GAN with deep transfer learning for coronavirus detection in chest X-ray images is presented. The lack of datasets for COVID-19 especially in chest X-rays images is the main motivation of this scientific study. The main idea is to collect all the possible images for COVID-19 that exists until the writing of this research and use the GAN network to generate more images to help in the detection of this virus from the available X-rays images with the highest accuracy possible. The dataset used in this research was collected from different sources and it is available for researchers to download and use it. The number of images in the collected dataset is 307 images for four different types of classes. The classes are the COVID-19, normal, pneumonia bacterial, and pneumonia virus. Three deep transfer models are selected in this research for investigation. The models are the Alexnet, Googlenet, and Restnet18. Those models are selected for investigation through this research as it contains a small number of layers on their architectures, this will result in reducing the complexity, the consumed memory and the execution time for the proposed model. Three case scenarios are tested through the paper, the first scenario includes four classes from the dataset, while the second scenario includes 3 classes and the third scenario includes two classes. All the scenarios include the COVID-19 class as it is the main target of this research to be detected. In the first scenario, the Googlenet is selected to be the main deep transfer model as it achieves 80.6% in testing accuracy. In the second scenario, the Alexnet is selected to be the main deep transfer model as it achieves 85.2% in testing accuracy, while in the third scenario which includes two classes (COVID-19, and normal), Googlenet is selected to be the main deep transfer model as it achieves 100% in testing accuracy and 99.9% in the validation accuracy.

Critically, we show that using different definitions alters the projected effects of key parameters-such as inter-regional travel rates, degree of pre-existing immunity, and heterogeneity in transmission rates between regions-on the risk of a pandemic. Our analysis provides a foundation for understanding the scientific importance of precise language when discussing pandemic risk, illustrating how alternative definitions affect the conclusions of modelling studies.

Detecting the virus is the first step in diagnosing the infection, followed by quarantine to prevent transmission. Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs (NP/OP) and saliva are two specimen types that are most often analyzed to detect SARS-CoV-2 by molecular tests that detect viral RNA or by antigen/antibody tests that detect viral proteins and/or the host immune response against the virus. Compared to antigen/antibody tests, molecular tests are highly sensitive and specific for detecting the virus. A significant drawback is that specimen collection requirements are specific to each test and cannot be interchanged with another test. Some tests are qualified to be used on NP swabs or saliva, but not both specimen types. Even with NP swabs, a test may be qualified to detect the virus only with swabs collected in viral transport medium (VTM) but not in other media. These restrictive pre-analytic steps are disadvantageous in that a lab would have to develop and validate different tests for SARS-CoV-2 depending on the specimen type and collection media, with added setup cost, infrastructure, and training requirements. To overcome these problems, we developed and validated a cost-effective multiplex reverse-transcription real-time PCR assay that can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 in different specimen types. The assay is highly sensitive and specific, can be used to detect the virus in saliva as well as NP swabs collected in different media such as VTM, saline, and commercial preservative fluid, and serves as one test for all applications. The protocol also describes an optimal laboratory setup and unidirectional workflow for detecting SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. © 2021 The Authors. Current Protocols published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.

However, the exclusive breastfeeding rate in China is low and decreasing. Mobile technologies have rapidly developed; communication apps such as WeChat (one of the largest social networking platforms in China) are widely used and have the potential to conveniently improve health behaviors. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of using WeChat to improve breastfeeding practices. METHODS: This 2-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted among pregnant women from May 2019 to April 2020 in Huzhu County, Qinghai Province, China. Pregnant women were eligible to participate if they were aged 18 years or older, were 11 to 37 weeks pregnant with a singleton fetus, had no known illness that could limit breastfeeding after childbirth, used WeChat through their smartphone, and had access to the internet. A total of 344 pregnant women were recruited at baseline, with 170 in the intervention group and 174 in the control group. Women in the intervention group received breastfeeding knowledge and promotion information weekly through a WeChat official account from their third month of pregnancy to 6 months postpartum. The primary outcome of exclusive and predominant breastfeeding rate was measured 0-1 month, 2-3 months, and 4-5 months postpartum. RESULTS: At 0-1 month postpartum, the exclusive breastfeeding rate was significantly higher in the intervention group than that in the control group (81.1% vs 63.3%; odds ratio [OR] 2.75, 95% CI 1.58-4.78; P<.001). Similarly, mothers in the intervention group were more likely to provide predominantly breast milk (OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.55-4.96; P<.001) and less likely to give dairy products to their children (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.21-0.75; P=.005). There was no statistically significant difference for exclusive breastfeeding rate 2-3 months (P=.09) and 4-5 months postpartum (P=.27), though more children in the intervention group were exclusively breastfed than those in the control group 2-3 months postpartum (intervention: 111/152, 73.0%; control: 96/152, 63.2%) and 4-5 months postpartum(intervention: 50/108, 46.3%; control: 46/109, 42.2%). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first effort to promote exclusive breastfeeding through WeChat in China, which proved to be an effective method of promoting exclusive breastfeeding in early life. WeChat health education can be used in addition to local breastfeeding promotion programs.

This article provides practical guidance to front-line physicians forced to make critical rationing decisions. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Medline search for scientific literature, reviews, and guidance documents related to epidemic ICU triage including from professional bodies. STUDY SELECTION: Clinical studies, reviews, and guidelines were selected and reviewed by all authors and discussed by internet conference and email. DATA EXTRACTION: References and data were based on relevance and author consensus. DATA SYNTHESIS: We review key challenges of resource-driven triage and data from affected ICUs. We recommend that once available resources are maximally extended, triage is justified utilizing a strategy that provides the greatest good for the greatest number of patients. A triage algorithm based on clinical estimations of the incremental survival benefit (saving the most life-years) provided by ICU care is proposed. ""First come, first served"" is used to choose between individuals with equal priorities and benefits. The algorithm provides practical guidance, is easy to follow, rapidly implementable and flexible. It has four prioritization categories: performance score, ASA score, number of organ failures, and predicted survival. Individual units can readily adapt the algorithm to meet local requirements for the evolving pandemic. Although the algorithm improves consistency and provides practical and psychologic support to those performing triage, the final decision remains a clinical one. Depending on country and operational circumstances, triage decisions may be made by a triage team or individual doctors. However, an experienced critical care specialist physician should be ultimately responsible for the triage decision. Cautious discharge criteria are proposed acknowledging the difficulties to facilitate the admission of queuing patients. CONCLUSIONS: Individual institutions may use this guidance to develop prospective protocols that assist the implementation of triage decisions to ensure fairness, enhance consistency, and decrease provider moral distress.","Sprung, Charles L; Joynt, Gavin M; Christian, Michael D; Truog, Robert D; Rello, Jordi; Nates, Joseph L",Crit Care Med,72,16

Worldwide demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) has risen, with diminishing supplies and shortages reported. During the pandemic, charitable donations have been made by the public, aimed at helping medical staff. Based on the open data, we investigate the charitable in-kind donations received by a large medical center in northern Taiwan (Taipei Veterans General Hospital, TPEVGH) in Taiwan during the pandemic. METHODS: The period of investigation was the first half of the year 2020. TPEVGH has received various public donations. The list of donations published on the hospital's official website was analyzed. The variables in the analysis were donation category, donation percentage, number of donations, and total donation amount. RESULTS: Most in-kind donations were food and beverages (55.1%), with a monetary value of 3,124,510 New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) (24.3%). Medical equipment accounted for the second highest number of items (34.8%) but was the highest monetary value (70.6%; 9,275,945 of 12,875,855 NTD). Daily necessities accounted for the lowest number of items (10.1%) and had a total monetary value of 475,400 NTD (3.7%). Over two-thirds were beverages (68.4%), all of which were bottles or cans for easy storage. Despite only five items (13.2%) being juice, the donation size was the largest, accounting for nearly half (47.1%) of the total monetary value. Only one item was fruit, which was high-class organic apples. The monetary value of this item was the highest (7.8%) among all donated food. Most donated snacks were biscuits. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, most public donations to TPEVGH were food and daily necessities. While every donation should be appreciated, accepting high volumes of donations might incur donation management problems. Further research could be focused on managerial aspects, e.g., quality and safety checking, storage, distribution.","Lin, Ching-Wei; Hsu, Ya-Chuan; Wu, Chien-Cheng; Chen, Tzeng-Ji; Hwang, Shinn-Jang",J.

Potential therapeutics include repurposed drugs, some with cardiac liabilities. We report on a chronic preclinical drug screening platform, a cardiac microphysiological system (MPS), to assess cardiotoxicity associated with repurposed hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZM) polytherapy in a mock phase I safety clinical trial. The MPS contained human heart muscle derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. The effect of drug response was measured using outputs that correlate with clinical measurements, such as QT interval (action potential duration) and drug-biomarker pairing. Chronic exposure (10 days) of heart muscle to HCQ alone elicited early afterdepolarizations and increased QT interval past 5 days. AZM alone elicited an increase in QT interval from day 7 onward, and arrhythmias were observed at days 8 and 10. Monotherapy results mimicked clinical trial outcomes. Upon chronic exposure to HCQ and AZM polytherapy, we observed an increase in QT interval on days 4-8. Interestingly, a decrease in arrhythmias and instabilities was observed in polytherapy relative to monotherapy, in concordance with published clinical trials. Biomarkers, most of them measurable in patients' serum, were identified for negative effects of monotherapy or polytherapy on tissue contractile function, morphology, and antioxidant protection. The cardiac MPS correctly predicted clinical arrhythmias associated with QT prolongation and rhythm instabilities. This high content system can help clinicians design their trials, rapidly project cardiac outcomes, and define new monitoring biomarkers to accelerate access of patients to safe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapeutics.","Charrez, Bérénice; Charwat, Verena; Siemons, Brian; Finsberg, Henrik; Miller, Evan W; Edwards, Andrew G; Healy, Kevin E",Clin Transl Sci,72,16

This paper examines that proposition, using state-level data on public pensions developed by the Pew Trust, and jointly by the Federal Reserve Board and the Bureau of Economic Analysis. There is little evidence that measures of the level of unfunded pension plan liabilities lead directly to a state's soft economic performance, though growth in unfunded liabilities appear to be associated with lower growth. While these results suggest that reductions in the growth of a state's pension debt may be beneficial, they arguably do not imply that dramatic action to reduce liabilities is necessarily called for. In that regard, the implications are comparable to those of Lenney et al. (2019), that suggest that reasonable goals for some presumed highly troubled systems are stabilization of the ratio of their unfunded liabilities to their state's nominal GDP, rather than outright elimination of the debt.","Steindel, Charles",Bus Econ,72,16

232628,232628,232628,Understanding Coronavirus,13.335928,4.908839,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The spike glycoprotein plays a critical role in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by recognizing the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and mediating fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane. It is also the major target for neutralizing antibodies and vaccines. This review summarizes recent studies on the structure and function of spike glycoprotein, which revealed the structural basis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, similar to those of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, spontaneously samples different prefusion states with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) adopting 'up' or 'down' conformations, and the RBD 'down' to 'up' conformational change is required for ACE2 binding. Receptor binding and spike glycoprotein priming by host proteases such as furin and transmembrane protease serine 2 induce pre to postfusion conformational changes of the spike trimer that enable membrane fusion. Interactions between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 were elucidated at atomic resolution using high-resolution crystal structures. These structures, together with adapted and remodeled SARS-CoV-2 strains, further revealed critical residues of the spike glycoprotein for SARS-CoV-2 infection and cross-species transmission. SUMMARY: Recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein provide important structural knowledge for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and cross-species transmission.","Ge, Jiwan; Zhang, Senyan; Zhang, Linqi; Wang, Xinquan",Curr Opin HIV AIDS,72,16

Globally, a number of studies were conducted to estimate the average serial interval and incubation period of COVID-19. Combining findings of existing studies that estimate the average serial interval and incubation period of COVID-19 significantly improves the quality of evidence. Hence, this study aimed to determine the overall average serial interval and incubation period of COVID-19. METHODS: We followed the PRISMA checklist to present this study. A comprehensive search strategy was carried out from international electronic databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library) by two experienced reviewers (MAA and DBK) authors between the 1st of June and the 31st of July 2020. All observational studies either reporting the serial interval or incubation period in persons diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. Heterogeneity across studies was assessed using the I2 and Higgins test. The NOS adapted for cross-sectional studies was used to evaluate the quality of studies. A random effect Meta-analysis was employed to determine the pooled estimate with 95% (CI). Microsoft Excel was used for data extraction and R software was used for analysis. RESULTS: We combined a total of 23 studies to estimate the overall mean serial interval of COVID-19. The mean serial interval of COVID-19 ranged from 4. 2 to 7.5 days. Our meta-analysis showed that the weighted pooled mean serial interval of COVID-19 was 5.2 (95%CI: 4.9-5.5) days. Additionally, to pool the mean incubation period of COVID-19, we included 14 articles. The mean incubation period of COVID-19 also ranged from 4.8 to 9 days. Accordingly, the weighted pooled mean incubation period of COVID-19 was 6.5 (95%CI: 5.9-7.1) days. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that the weighted pooled mean serial interval and incubation period of COVID-19 were 5.2, and 6.5 days, respectively. In this study, the average serial interval of COVID-19 is shorter than the average incubation period, which suggests that substantial numbers of COVID-19 cases will be attributed to presymptomatic transmission.","Alene, Muluneh; Yismaw, Leltework; Assemie, Moges Agazhe; Ketema, Daniel Bekele; Gietaneh, Wodaje; Birhan, Tilahun Yemanu",BMC Infect Dis,72,20

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The advisory of postponing or canceling elective surgeries escalated a worldwide debate regarding the safety and feasibility of performing elective surgical procedures during this pandemic. Limited data are available on gastrointestinal cancer patients with pre/asymptomatic COVID-19 undergoing surgery. METHODS: Clinical data were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Surgically resected specimens of the cases with confirmed COVID-19 were obtained to detect the expression of ACE2 and the presence of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients (male, 34) with a median age 62.5 years were enrolled. All the patients presented no respiratory symptoms or abnormalities on chest computed tomography before surgery. Six patients (11.5%) experienced symptom onset and were confirmed to be COVID-19. All were identified to be preoperatively pre/asymptomatic, as 5 were with SARS-CoV-2 presenting in cytoplasm of enterocytes or macrophages from the colorectal tissues and 1 had symptom onset immediately after surgery. The case fatality rate in patients with COVID-19 was 16.7%, much higher than those without COVID-19 (2.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal cancer patients with pre/asymptomatic COVID-19 were at high risk of postoperative onset and death. At current pandemic, elective surgery should be postponed or canceled. It highlights the need for investigating the full clinical spectrum and natural history of this infection. The early colorectal tropism of SARS-CoV-2 may have major implications on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19.","Liu, Yan-Liang; Ren, Jun; Yuan, Jing-Ping; Zhang, Zhi-Jiang; Guo, Wen-Yi; Guan, Yang; Moeckel, Gilbert; Ahuja, Nita; Fu, Tao",Ann Surg,72,12

The aim of the present study was to describe country-level data (the number of patients with stroke, the proportion of patients with acute stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA), the proportion of patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis [IVT] or mechanical thrombectomy [MT], the door-to-needle times [DNT], and the onset-to-needle time [ONT]) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Slovakia. METHODS: The study examined data from the stroke register at the National Health Information Centre. Data from three time periods (March to April 2020; March to April 2019; January to February 2020) were compared using an independent samples t-test and the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney two-sample rank-sum test. RESULTS: The number of stroke patients admitted to hospitals in Slovakia during the COVID-19 period showed a decrease (1673 vs. 2328 in period 2 and 2155 in period 3). The proportions of patients with TIA remained the same in periods 1 and 2 (9.7% vs. 11.7%) and in periods 1 and 3 (9.7 vs. 11.8%). The percentage of patients treated with IVT during the pandemic (22.4%) did not differ from period 2 (20.0%) or period 3 (21.4%). No difference was found in the rate of MT between the COVID-19 period (10.2%) and the same period in 2019 (10.7%) and in January to February 2020 (13.1%). The median DNT remained unchanged in periods 1 (30 min), 2 (35 min) and 3 (30 min), and no differences were found in median ONT in periods 1 (130 min), 2 (130 min) and 3 (140 min). CONCLUSION: We found a decreased number of stroke patients during the COVID-19 outbreak in Slovakia, but no evidence of a change in the quality of acute stroke care.","Gdovinová, Zuzana; Vitková, Marianna; Baráková, Anna; Cvopová, Alena",Eur. j. neurol,72,1

METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective, observational study of patients with suspected COVID-19 and confirmed COVID-19. Patient background, clinical course, laboratory and computed tomography (CT) findings, and the presence of alternative diagnoses were evaluated. Clinical risk scores were developed based on clinical differences between patients with and without COVID-19. RESULTS: Among 110 patients suspected of having COVID-19, 60.9% underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing based on the judgment of physicians. Two patients were found to have COVID-19. The clinical characteristics of 108 non-COVID-19 patients were compared with those of 23 confirmed COVID-19 patients. Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to have a history of high-risk exposures and an abnormal sense of taste and smell. The COVID-19 group had significantly higher rates of subnormal white blood cell counts, lower eosinophil counts, and lower procalcitonin levels than the non-COVID-19 group. When blood test results, CT findings, and the presence of alternative diagnoses were scored on an 11-point scale (i.e., ""COVID-19 Clinical Risk Score""), the COVID-19 group scored significantly higher than the non-COVID-19 group, more than four points in the COVID-19 group. All non-COVID patients who did not undergo PCR had a score of 4 or less. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 Clinical Risk Score may enable the risk classification of patients suspected of having COVID-19 and can help in decision-making in clinical practice, including appropriateness of diagnostic testing. Further studies and prospective validation with an increased sample size are required.","Nakakubo, Sho; Suzuki, Masaru; Kamada, Keisuke; Yamashita, Yu; Nakamura, Junichi; Horii, Hiroshi; Sato, Kazuki; Matsumoto, Munehiro; Abe, Yuki; Tsuji, Kosuke; Ishiguro, Nobuhisa; Nasuhara, Yasuyuki; Konno, Satoshi",BMC Infect Dis,72,16

A modified Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) was used to assess disease activity among 3435 patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA) who participated in a survey designed to assess the effect of their disease and its treatment on the susceptibility and severity of Covid-19. Chi square testing was used to compare BASDAI scores between HLA-B27 positive and negative subjects. 2836 survey respondents were HLA B27 positive. The average BASDAI for the HLA-B27 negative cohort was 4.92 compared to 4.34 for the HLA-B27 positive subjects. Based on linear regression, a subject's sex could not fully account for the differing BASDAI score in HLA-B27 negative subjects compared to those who are HLA-B27 positive. The difference between B27 positive and negative subjects was skewed by those with a BASDAI score of one or two. HLA-B27 positive subjects were more than twice as likely to have a BASDAI score of 1 compared to HLA B27 negative subjects and about 60% more likely to have a BASDAI score of 2 (p < 0.0001). HLA-B27 positive subjects have less active spondyloarthritis compared to HLA-B27 negative subjects as measured by a BASDAI score. Our data indicate that patients with mild back pain and a diagnosis of AxSpA are disproportionately HLA-B27 positive. The HLA-B27 test facilitates the diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis such that patients from a community survey with mild back pain may be disproportionately diagnosed as having AxSpA if they are HLA-B27 positive. The test result likely introduces a cognitive bias into medical decision making and could explain our observations.","Rosenbaum, James T; Weisman, Michael H; Hamilton, Hedley; Shafer, Cassie; Aslanyan, Elin; Howard, Richard A; Ogle, Kimberly; Reveille, John D; Winthrop, Kevin L; Choi, Dongseok",Sci Rep,72,26

In nonmalignant tissue, PC plays an essential role in controlling whole-body energetics through regulation of gluconeogenesis in the liver, synthesis of fatty acids in adipocytes, and insulin secretion in pancreatic ß cells. In breast cancer, PC activity is linked to pulmonary metastasis, potentially by providing the ability to utilize glucose, fatty acids, and glutamine metabolism as needed under varying conditions as cells metastasize. PC enzymatic activity appears to be of particular importance in cancer cells that are unable to utilize glutamine for anaplerosis. Moreover, PC activity also plays a role in lipid metabolism and protection from oxidative stress in cancer cells. Thus, PC activity may be essential to link energy substrate utilization with cancer progression and to enable the metabolic flexibility necessary for cell resilience to changing and adverse conditions during the metastatic process.","Kiesel, Violet A; Sheeley, Madeline P; Coleman, Michael F; Cotul, Eylem Kulkoyluoglu; Donkin, Shawn S; Hursting, Stephen D; Wendt, Michael K; Teegarden, Dorothy",Cancer Metab,72,1

We further find that label suggestions from interactively trained models do not lead to an improvement over suggestions from a static model. Nonetheless, our analysis of suggestion bias shows that annotators remain capable of reflecting upon the suggested label in general. Finally, we confirm the quality of the annotated data in transfer learning experiments between different annotator groups.

Here, we validated and investigated the usefulness of measuring serum antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using the iFlash3000 CLIA analyzer. We measured IgM and IgG titers against SARS-CoV-2 in sera collected from 26 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients, 53 COVID-19-suspected but PCR-negative patients, and 20 and 100 randomly selected non-COVID-19 patients who visited our hospital in 2020 and 2017, respectively. The repeatability and within-laboratory precision were obviously good in validations, following to the CLSI document EP15-A3. Linearity was also considered good between 0.6 AU/mL and 112.7 AU/mL for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and between 3.2 AU/mL and 55.3 AU/mL for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, while the linearity curves plateaued above the upper measurement range. We also confirmed that the seroconversion and no-antibody titers were over the cutoff values in all 100 serum samples collected in 2017. These results indicate that this measurement system successfully detects SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG. We observed four false-positive cases in the IgM assay and no false-positive cases in the IgG assay when 111 serum samples known to contain autoantibodies were evaluated. The concordance rates of the antibody test with the PCR test were 98.1% for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and 100% for IgG among PCR-negative cases and 30.8% for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and 73.1% for SARS-CoV-2 IgG among PCR-positive cases. In conclusion, the performance of this new automated method for detecting antibody against both N and S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 is sufficient for use in laboratory testing.","Yokoyama, Rin; Kurano, Makoto; Morita, Yoshifumi; Shimura, Takuya; Nakano, Yuki; Qian, Chungen; Xia, Fuzhen; He, Fan; Kishi, Yoshiro; Okada, Jun; Yoshikawa, Naoyuki; Nagura, Yutaka; Okazaki, Hitoshi; Moriya, Kyoji; Seto, Yasuyuki; Kodama, Tatsuhiko; Yatomi, Yutaka",PLoS One,72,20

The objective was to evaluate association between standardized simple visual lung damage CT score (vldCTs) at admission, which does not require any software, and 30-day mortality. METHODS: In a single-center prospective cohort of COVID-19 patients included during 4 weeks, the presence and extent of ground glass opacities(GGO), consolidation opacities, or both of them were visually assessed in each of the 5 lung lobes (score from 0 to 4 per lobe depending on the percentage and out of 20 per patient = vldCTs) after the first chest CT performed to detect COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: Among 210 confirmed COVID-19 patients, the number of survivors and non-survivors was 162 (77%) and 48 (23%), respectively at 30 days. vldCTs was significantly higher in non-survivors, and the AUC of vldCTs to distinguish survivors and non-survivors was 0.72 (95%CI 0.628-0.807, p < 0.001); the best cut-off vldCTs value was 7. During follow-up, significant differences in discharges and 30-day mortality were observed between patients with vldCTs &#8805; 7 versus vldCTs < 7: (98 [85.2%] vs 49 [51.6%]; p < 0.001 and 36 [37.9%] vs 12 [12.4%]; p < 0.001, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: By using chest CT in COVID-19 patients, extensive lung damage can be visually assessed with a score related to 30-day mortality independent of conventional risk factors of the disease. KEY POINTS: â¢ In non-selected COVID-19 patients included prospectively during 4 weeks, the extent of ground glass opacities(GGO) and consolidation opacities evaluated by a simple visual score was related to 30-day mortality independent of age, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation levels, comorbidities, and hs-troponin I level at admission. â¢ This severity score should be incorporated into risk stratification algorithms and in structured chest CT reports requiring a standardized reading by radiologists in case of COVID-19.","Charpentier, Etienne; Soulat, Gilles; Fayol, Antoine; Hernigou, Anne; Livrozet, Marine; Grand, Teodor; Reverdito, Guillaume; Al Haddad, Jad; Dang Tran, Kim Diep; Charpentier, Anne; Clement, Olivier; Hulot, Jean-Sebastien; Mousseaux, Elie",Eur. radiol,72,1

Information on the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) is limited, yet vital to provide accurate advice for children with CF, their families, caregivers and clinical teams. METHODS: Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children with CF aged less than 18 years were collated by the CF Registry Global Harmonization Group across 13 countries between 1 February and 7 August 2020. RESULTS: Data on 105 children were collated and analysed. Median age of cases was ten years (interquartile range 6-15), 54% were male and median percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in one second was 94% (interquartile range 79-104). The majority (71%) of children were managed in the community during their COVID-19 illness. Out of 24 children admitted to hospital, six required supplementary oxygen and two non-invasive ventilation. Around half were prescribed antibiotics, five children received antiviral treatments, four azithromycin and one additional corticosteroids. Children that were hospitalised had lower lung function and reduced body mass index Z-scores. One child died six weeks after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 following a deterioration that was not attributed to COVID-19 disease. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection in children with CF is usually associated with a mild illness in those who do not have pre-existing severe lung disease.","Bain, Robert; Cosgriff, Rebecca; Zampoli, Marco; Elbert, Alexander; Burgel, Pierre-Régis; Carr, Siobhán B; Castaños, Claudio; Colombo, Carla; Corvol, Harriet; Faro, Albert; Goss, Christopher H; Gutierrez, Hector; Jung, Andreas; Kashirskaya, Nataliya; Marshall, Bruce C; Melo, Joel; Mondejar-Lopez, Pedro; de Monestrol, Isabelle; Naehrlich, Lutz; Padoan, Rita; Pastor-Vivero, Maria Dolores; Rizvi, Samar; Salvatore, Marco; Filho, Luiz Vicente Ribeiro Ferreira da Silva; Brownlee, Keith G; Haq, Iram J; Brodlie, Malcolm",J Cyst Fibros,72,28

Consequently, several guidelines have been developed and instituted by various countries to prevent the spread of the disease among the citizenry. This paper aims to explore the COVID-19 guidelines incorporated in the health and safety management policies of construction firms in South Africa. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative approach was adopted for the study. Data was collected from construction companies by means of an open-ended questionnaire. The open-ended questionnaire was distributed by using the purposive sampling technique. The collected data was analysed with thematic content analysis. Findings: The findings show that most construction companies have incorporated aspects of COVID-19 guidelines into the site health and safety policies, whereas the majority of the companies had incorporated guidelines such as site access, handling of COVID-19 cases, induction, screening and social distancing;only a few had incorporated guidelines such as compliance, sanitisation, sick leave, wearing of personal protective equipment, audit and risk assessment, lunchtime rules and grouping of workers into the health and safety policies on site. Research limitations/implications: Data was collected from higher grade firms;therefore, the research findings may not be applied to smaller construction firms. A study that focuses on lower grades is recommended. Practical implications: Construction companies could use the recommendations provided to improve upon the policies developed/adopted to curb the spread of CVID-19 on-site. Originality/value: Research on COVID-19 construction site health and safety measures are still being developed.

Patients receiving remdesivir revealed a greater likelihood of discharge [10 day remdesivir versus control: ORâ=â1.32 (95% CI 1.09-1.60); 5 day remdesivir versus control: ORâ=â1.73 (95% CI 1.28-2.35)] and recovery [10 day remdesivir versus control: OR = 1.29 (95% CI 1.03-1.60); 5 day remdesivir versus control: ORâ=â1.80 (95% CI 1.31-2.48)] than those in the control group. In contrast, no mortality benefit was observed following remdesivir therapy. Furthermore, no significant association was observed between remdesivir treatment and an increased risk of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Remdesivir can help improve the clinical outcome of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and a 5 day regimen, instead of a 10 day regimen, may be sufficient for treatment. Moreover, remdesivir appears as tolerable as other comparators or placebo.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Chen, Chao-Hsien; Wang, Cheng-Yi; Chen, Kuang-Hung; Wang, Ya-Hui; Hsueh, Po-Ren",J Antimicrob Chemother,72,20

Clinically, it may manifest as mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE), with GAD-Ab patients difficult to distinguish. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare brain metabolism of patients with mTLE and high serum titers of GAD-Ab (>2000 UI/ml) to those with mTLE and hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and confirmed GAD-ab negativity. METHODS: Images from PET studies were normalized to an SPM 12 template. Voxel to voxel comparisons were made using a two-sample one-tailed t-test. RESULTS: In both patients with GAD-Ab and controls (mTLE-HS), hypometabolism in mesial temporal lobe areas was observed. When comparing the two groups, GAD-Ab patients had statistically significant reduced metabolism in both insulae and medial inferior frontal-hypothalamus area (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Hypometabolism in mesial temporal lobe areas together with hypometabolism in insulae and medial inferior frontal-hypothalamus may be characteristic of patients with epilepsy and GAD-ab.

This study reports the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during, respiratory complications and 30-day mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study included 100 consecutive patients. The primary outcome measure was 14-day symptoms and/or SARS-CoV-2 test. The secondary outcome was 30-day postoperative mortality. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients comprising 35 females and 65 males, with a mean age of 52.4 years (range, 16-94 years) included 16 males aged greater than 70 years. The 51% of patients were tested during their admission for SARS-CoV-2; 5% were diagnosed/developed symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 during and until 14 days post-discharge; four were male and one female, mean age 41.2 years (range, 17-75 years), all had primary malignant bone or soft-tissue tumours, four of five had received immunosuppressive therapy pre-operatively. The 30-day mortality was 1% overall and 20% in those with SARS-CoV-2. The pulmonary complication rate was 3% overall.

A comorbidity score could help in clinical stratification of patients admitted to internal medicine units. Our aim was to assess a novel modified Elixhauser index (mEi) and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) for predicting in-hospital mortality (IHM) in internal medicine patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This single-center retrospective study enrolled all consecutive patients discharged from internal medicine unit with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both the mEi and CCI were easily calculated from administrative data. Comorbidity scores were tested using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the respective area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: The total sample consisted of 151 individuals, and 30 (19.9%) died during their hospital stay. Deceased subjects were older (82.8±10.8 vs. 63.3±18.1 years; p<0.001) and had a higher burden of comorbidities: the mEi and CCI were 29.9±11 vs. 8.8±9.2 and 4.6±2.6 vs. 1.2±2 (p<0.001), respectively. Only the mEi was independently associated with IHM (OR 1.173), and ROC curves analysis showed that the AUCs were 0.863 and 0.918 for the CCI and for mEi, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patients admitted to internal medicine wards with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the mEi showed a better performance in predicting IHM than CCI.","De Giorgi, A; Fabbian, F; Greco, S; Di Simone, E; De Giorgio, R; Passaro, A; Zuliani, G; Manfredini, R",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,72,16

METHODS: All consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 11 to February 6, 2020, were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. RESULTS: A total of 663 COVID-19 patients were included in this study.

The payment system has long rewarded hospitals for providing elective surgical procedures to well-insured patients while penalizing those providing the most essential and urgent services, causing hospital revenues to plummet as elective procedures were cancelled during the pandemic. Before the recession caused by the pandemic, tens of millions of Americans were unable to afford care, compromising their physical and financial health; deep-pocketed corporate interests were increasingly dominating the hospital industry and taking over physicians' practices; and insurers' profits hit record levels.

We determined the rate of re-infection, associated factors and mortality during follow up in a cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We analyzed 9,119 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who received serial tests in total of 62 healthcare facilities in United States between December 1, 2019 to November 13, 2020. Re-infection was defined by two positive tests separated by interval of greater than 90 days two after resolution of first infection was confirmed by two or more consecutive negative tests. We performed logistic regression analysis to identify demographic and clinical characteristics associated with re-infection. RESULTS: Re-infection was identified in 0.7% (n=63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5%-0.9%) during follow up of 9,119 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mean period (±standard deviation [SD]) between two positive tests was 116 ± 21 days. A logistic regression analysis identified that asthma (odds ratio [OR] 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.2) and nicotine dependence/tobacco use (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.6-4.5) were associated with re-infection. There was a significantly lower rate of pneumonia, heart failure, and acute kidney injury observed with re-infection compared with primary infection among the 63 patients with re-infection There were two deaths (3.2%) associated with re-infection. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a low rate of re-infection confirmed by laboratory tests in a large cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although re-infection appeared to be milder than primary infection, there was associated mortality.","Qureshi, Adnan I; Baskett, William I; Huang, Wei; Lobanova, Iryna; Naqvi, S Hasan; Shyu, Chi-Ren",Clin. infect. dis,72,16

In order to overcome this pandemic, huge amounts of work have been accomplished, and many papers published. However, most of these works are from medical institutes and/ or hospitals, and the attempts to solve this tragedy by chemical approaches have been rather scarce. This account surveys chemical information on COVID-19 with special emphasis on molecular-level understanding. In the first part, the fundamentals of causative pathogen SARS-CoV-2 (structures of genome and proteins of this virus) are briefly described. Next, the molecular structure of the spike on the viral surface, the key component for the infection of human beings, is shown. Then, the binding mode of these spikes to the receptors on human cells (ACE2) is presented in detail, based on the structural data. The conformational change of spike proteins is critically important for the virus to enter human cells. Furthermore, the roles of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 in the promotion of pathogenicity are discussed primarily in terms of the spike/ACE2 interactions. Finally, the origins of unprecedentedly high pathogenicity of this virus are proposed. This account should help the readers to understand the current status of our chemical knowledge on COVID-19, promoting the research to attack the worst pandemic of the last 100 years.","Komiyama, Makoto",Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan,72,16

The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the risk of death and other important outcomes for these patients. We searched Pubmed and EMBASE up to August 20, 2020, to identify reports of patients with hematologic malignancy and COVID-19. The primary outcome was a pooled mortality estimate, considering all patients and only hospitalized patients. Secondary outcomes included risk of ICU admission and ventilation in hospitalized patients. Subgroup analyses included mortality stratified by age, treatment status, and malignancy subtype. Pooled prevalence, risk ratios (RR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random-effects model. 34 adult and 5 pediatric studies (3377 patients) from Asia, Europe, and North America were included (14/34 adult studies included only hospitalized patients). The risk of death amongst adult patients was 34% (95% CI 28-39, N=3240) in this sample of predominantly hospitalized patients. Patients aged >60 years had a significantly higher risk of death than patients <60 years (RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.45-2.27, N=1169). The risk of death in pediatric patients was 4% (95% CI 1-9, N=102). The RR of death comparing patients with recent systemic anti-cancer therapy to no treatment was 1.17 (95% CI 0.83-1.64; N=736).

This study is aimed at investigating the biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality due to outbreaks of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections. The data on the global outbreak of COVID-19, were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO), Worldometer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and research institutes. The information was also recorded from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in Pub Med and Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science on the trends in the prevalence and mortality due to COVID-19 infection outbreaks. The results show rising trends in the transmission, prevalence and mortality rate due to coronavirus COVID-19. During the period of December 29, 2019 through March 31, 2020, it has infected 750890 people worldwide, resulting in 36405 deaths with a mortality rate of 4.84%. The infections were more frequent among male gender with above 60 years of age. The mean growth rate index for total number of cases from January 23 to March 31, 2020 was 1.20 and growth rate index for mortality rate was 1.12. There was a positive association between the prevalence and mortality rate (R2=0.996). The novel coronavirus COVID-19 is highly contagious and has affected a large number of people worldwide. It is still spreading with mutable prevalence and mortality outbreak trends. The global health officials have taken priority measures to prevent the further outbreaks of this emerging pathogen across the globe. However, the rising number of cases and mortality risk estimates are demonstrating that enhanced public health mediations, good hygienic conditions, social distancing and movement limitations may control the COVID-19 epidemics.","Meo, Sultan Ayoub; Al-Khlaiwi, Thamir; Usmani, Adnan Mahmood; Meo, Anusha Sultan; Klonoff, David C; Hoang, Thanh D",,72,28

Deaths on duty, including deaths due to overwork, during the COVID-19 response were usually reported on web-based platforms for public recognition and solidarity. Although no official statistics are available for these casualties, a list of on-duty deaths has been made publicly available on the web by crowdsourcing. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the trends and characteristics of deaths related to overwork among the frontline nonclinical essential workers participating in nonpharmaceutical interventions during the first wave of COVID-19 in China. METHODS: Based on a web-based crowdsourced list of deaths on duty during the first wave of the COVID-19 response in China, we manually verified all overwork-related death records against the full-text web reports from credible sources. After excluding deaths caused by COVID-19 infection and accidents, a total of 340 deaths related to overwork among nonclinical essential workers were attributed to combatting the COVID-19 crisis. We coded the key characteristics of the deceased workers, including sex, age at death, location, causes of death, date of incidence, date of death, containment duties, working area, and occupation. The temporal and spatial correlations between deaths from overwork and COVID-19 cases in China were also examined using Pearson correlation coefficient. RESULTS: From January 20 to April 26, 2020, at least 340 nonclinical frontline workers in China were reported to have died as a result of overwork while combatting COVID-19. The weekly overwork mortality was positively correlated with weekly COVID-19 cases (r=0.79, P<.001). Two-thirds of deceased workers (230/340, 67.6%) were under 55 years old, and two major causes of deaths related to overwork were cardiovascular diseases (138/340, 40.6%) and cerebrovascular diseases (73/340, 21.5%). Outside of Hubei province, there were almost 2.5 times as many deaths caused by COVID-19-related overwork (308/340, 90.6%) than by COVID-19 itself (n=120). CONCLUSIONS: The high number of deaths related to overwork among nonclinical essential workers at the frontline of the COVID-19 epidemic is alarming. Policies for occupational health protection against work hazards should therefore be prioritized and enforced.","Wang, Zhicheng; Lin, Leesa; Guo, Yan; Xiong, Huayi; Tang, Kun",J Med Internet Res,72,20

Many studies have been conducted to target the structures of RBD-ACE2 binding and to design RBD-targeting vaccines and drugs. Nevertheless, mutations distal from the SARS-CoV-2 RBD also impact its transmissibility and antibody can target non-RBD regions, suggesting the incomplete role of the RBD region in the spike protein-ACE2 binding. Here, in order to elucidate distant binding mechanisms, we analyze complexes of ACE2 with the wild-type spike protein and with key mutants via large-scale all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations. We find that though distributed approximately 10 nm away from the RBD, the SARS-CoV-2 polybasic cleavage sites enhance, via electrostatic interactions and hydration, the RBD-ACE2 binding affinity. A negatively charged tetrapeptide (GluGluLeuGlu) is then designed to neutralize the positively charged arginine on the polybasic cleavage sites. We find that the tetrapeptide GluGluLeuGlu binds to one of the three polybasic cleavage sites of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein lessening by 34% the RBD-ACE2 binding strength. This significant binding energy reduction demonstrates the feasibility to neutralize RBD-ACE2 binding by targeting this specific polybasic cleavage site. Our work enhances understanding of the binding mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, which may aid the design of therapeutics for COVID-19 infection.","Qiao, Baofu; Olvera de la Cruz, Monica",ACS Nano,72,16

However, there are currently no approved effective pharmacotherapies for COVID-19. Here, we combine homology modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and binding affinity calculations to determine potential targets for toremifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator which we have previously identified as a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor. Our results indicate the possibility of inhibition of the spike glycoprotein by toremifene, responsible for aiding in fusion of the viral membrane with the cell membrane, via a perturbation to the fusion core. An interaction between the dimethylamine end of toremifene and residues Q954 and N955 in heptad repeat 1 (HR1) perturbs the structure, causing a shift from what is normally a long, helical region to short helices connected by unstructured regions. Additionally, we found a strong interaction between toremifene and the methyltransferase nonstructural protein (NSP) 14, which could be inhibitory to viral replication via its active site. These results suggest potential structural mechanisms for toremifene by blocking the spike protein and NSP14 of SARS-CoV-2, offering a drug candidate for COVID-19.","Martin, William R; Cheng, Feixiong",J Proteome Res,72,16

To date, it is still not clear whether cerebrovascular manifestations are caused by direct viral action or indirect action mediated by inflammatory hyperactivation, and in some cases, the association may be casual rather than causal. Objective: To conduct a systematic review on the cerebrovascular events in COVID-19 infection. Evidence review: A comprehensive literature search on PubMed was performed including articles published from January 1, 2020, to July 23, 2020, using a suitable keyword strategy. Additional sources were added by the authors by reviewing related references. The systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Only articles reporting individual data on stroke mechanism and etiology, sex, age, past cardiovascular risk factors, COVID symptoms, admission NIHSS, D-dimer levels, and acute stroke treatment were selected for the review. Articles that did not report the clinical description of the cases were excluded. A descriptive statistical analysis of the data collected was performed. Finding: From a total of 1,210 articles published from January 1, 2020, to July 23, 2020, 80 articles (275 patients), which satisfied the abovementioned criteria, were included in this review. A total of 226 cases of ischemic stroke (IS), 35 cases of intracranial bleeding, and 14 cases of CVST were found. Among patients with IS, the mean age was 64.16 ±14.73 years (range 27-92 years) and 53.5% were male. The mean NIHSS score reported at the onset of stroke was 15.23 ±9.72 (range 0-40). Primary endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) was performed in 24/168 patients (14.29%), intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) was performed in 17/168 patients (10.12%), and combined IVT+EVT was performed in 11/168 patients (6.55%). According to the reported presence of large vessel occlusion (LVO) (105 patients), 31 patients (29.52%) underwent primary EVT or bridging. Acute intracranial bleeding was reported in 35 patients: 24 patients (68.57%) had intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), 4 patients (11.43%) had non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and the remaining 7 patients (20%) had the simultaneous presence of SAH and ICH. Fourteen cases of CVST were reported in the literature (50% males), mean age 42.8 years ±15.47 (range 23-72). Treatment was reported only in nine patients; seven were treated with anticoagulant therapy; one with acetazolamide, and one underwent venous mechanical thrombectomy. Conclusion: Cerebrovascular events are relatively common findings in COVID-19 infection, and they could have a multifactorial etiology. More accurate and prospective data are needed to better understand the impact of cerebrovascular events in COVID-19 infection.","Fraiman, Pedro; Godeiro Junior, Clecio; Moro, Elena; Cavallieri, Francesco; Zedde, Marialuisa",Front Neurol,72,21

We analyzed immune responses in 76 COVID-19 patients and 69 healthy individuals from Hong Kong and Atlanta, Georgia, United States. In the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of COVID-19 patients, we observed reduced expression of human leukocyte antigen class DR (HLA-DR) and proinflammatory cytokines by myeloid cells as well as impaired mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and interferon-&#945; (IFN-&#945;) production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells. By contrast, we detected enhanced plasma levels of inflammatory mediators-including EN-RAGE, TNFSF14, and oncostatin M-which correlated with disease severity and increased bacterial products in plasma. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed a lack of type I IFNs, reduced HLA-DR in the myeloid cells of patients with severe COVID-19, and transient expression of IFN-stimulated genes. This was consistent with bulk PBMC transcriptomics and transient, low IFN-&#945; levels in plasma during infection.

Meanwhile the Center for Disease Control guidance for air exchange in between patients may heavily impact workflows. To design a portable custom isolation device to reduce imaging equipment contamination during a pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Center for Disease Control air exchange guidelines and requirements were reviewed. Device functional requirements were outlined and designed. Engineering requirements were reviewed. Methods of practice and risk mitigation plans were outlined including donning and doffing procedures and failure modes. Cost impact was assessed in terms of CT patient throughput. RESULTS: CT air exchange solutions and alternatives were reviewed. Multiple isolation bag device designs were considered. Several designs were custom fabricated, prototyped and reduced to practice. A final design was tested on volunteers for comfort, test-fit, air seal, and breathability. Less than 14 times enhanced patient throughput was estimated, in an ideal setting, which could more than counterbalance the cost of the device itself. CONCLUSION: A novel isolation bag device is feasible for use in CT and might facilitate containment and reduce contamination in radiology departments during the COVID Pandemic.","Amalou, Amel; Turkbey, Baris; Xu, Sheng; Turkbey, Evrim; An, Peng; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo; Ierardi, Anna Maria; Suh, Robert; Amalou, Hayet; Wood, Bradford J",Acad Radiol,72,1

Special emphasis is put on the influence of deuteration on formamidinium, its position in the unit cell and disordering in comparison to fully hydrogenated FAPbBr3. The temperature-dependent measurements show that deuteration critically influences the crystal structures, i.e. results in partially-ordered temperature-dependent structural modifications in which two symmetry-independent molecule positions with additional dislocation of the molecular centre atom and molecular angle inclinations are present.","Franz, Alexandra; Többens, Daniel M; Lehmann, Frederike; Kärgell, Martin; Schorr, Susan",Acta Crystallogr B Struct Sci Cryst Eng Mater,72,16

This study aimed to acquire information regarding the gender-specific effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on aspects of professional and personal lives of a subset of pediatric cardiologists. We sent an online multiple-choice survey to a listserv of Pediatric Cardiologists. Data collected included demographics, dependent care details, work hours, leave from work, salary cut, childcare hours before and after the COVID-19 peak lockdown/stay at home mandate and partner involvement. Two hundred forty-two pediatric cardiologists with dependent care responsibilities responded (response rate of 20.2%). A significantly higher proportion of females reported a salary cut (29.1% of females vs 17.6% of males, pâ¯=â¯0.04) and scaled back or discontinued work (14% vs 5.3%; pâ¯=â¯0.03). Prior to the COVID-19 lockdown phase, females provided more hours of dependent care. Females also reported a significantly greater increase in childcare hours overall per week (45 hours post/30 hours pre vs 30 hours post/20 hours pre for men; p < 0.001). Male cardiologists were much more likely to have partners who reduced work hours (67% vs 28%; p < 0.001) and reported that their partners took a salary cut compared with partners of female cardiologists (51% vs 22%; p < 0.001). In conclusion, gender disparity in caregiver responsibilities existed among highly skilled pediatric cardiologists even before the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has disproportionately affected female pediatric cardiologists with respect to dependent care responsibilities, time at work, and financial compensation.","Ferns, Sunita J; Gautam, Shiva; Hudak, Mark L",Am J Cardiol,72,23

Pandemic response has been politicized, proven public health measures undermined, and public confidence in a science-based public health system reduced. This has been compounded by the large number of citizens without ready access to health care, who are overrepresented among infected, hospitalized, and fatal cases. Here, as part of the National Academy of Medicine's Vital Directions for Health and Health Care: Priorities for 2021 initiative, we review the US approach to pandemic preparedness and its impact on the response to COVID-19.

As of June 1, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has had a documented effect of over 6 million cases world-wide, amounting to over 370,000 deaths (World Health Organization, 2020. Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Situation. http://https://covid19.who.int/). Consequently, the high demand for testing has resulted in a depletion of commercially available consumables, including the recommended swabs and viral transport media (VTM) required for nasopharyngeal sampling. Therefore, the potential use of unvalidated alternatives must be explored to address the global shortage of testing supplies. To tackle this issue, we evaluated the utility of different swabs and transport mediums for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2. This study compared the performance of six swabs commonly found in primary and tertiary health care settings (PurFlock Ultra, FLOQSwab, Puritan Pur-Wraps cotton tipped applicators, Puritan polyester tipped applicators, MedPro 6"" cotton tipped applicators, and HOLOGIC Aptima) for their efficacy in testing for SARS-CoV-2. Separately, the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 was completed from different transport mediums (DMEM, PBS, 100 % ethanol, 0.9 % normal saline and VTM), which were kept up to three days at room temperature (RT). The results indicate that there is no meaningful difference in viral yield from different swabs and most transport mediums for the collection and detection of SARS-CoV-2, indicating swab and medium alternatives could be used if supplies run out.","Garnett, Lauren; Bello, Alexander; Tran, Kaylie N; Audet, Jonathan; Leung, Anders; Schiffman, Zachary; Griffin, Bryan D; Tailor, Nikesh; Kobasa, Darwyn; Strong, James E",J Virol Methods,72,27

Background: Not applicable Design/Methods: Patient data were obtained from medical records from the University of Wisconsin - Madison Hospitals in Madison, WI, USA. Results: We report a 59-year-old man who presented with ongoing cognitive changes and pneumonia. He was repeatedly COVID-19 positive with minimal symptoms for 4 weeks prior to admission. He had a past medical history notable for atrial fibrillation, biventricular pacemaker, end-stage renal disease secondary to idiopathic fibrillary glomerulonephritis, on hemodialysis awaiting transplantation. While admitted, he developed progressive right sided hemiparesis and persistent, progressive encephalopathy manifesting primarily with disorientation, agitation, and aggression. CSF was notable for cell count of 7, protein of 48, and glucose of 65. Anti-MOG antibody and AQP-4 antibody were negative. A series of CT/CTA head imaging with and without contrast showed progressive multifocal supratentorial areas of white matter hypoattenuation, partially ring enhancing on contrasted portion of study.

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped RNA virus, from the genus Betacoronavirus. Although few molecules have been tested and shown some efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in humans but a safe and cost-effective attachment inhibitors are still required for the treatment of COVID-19. Natural products are gaining attention because of the large therapeutic window and potent antiviral, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Therefore, this study was planned to screen natural products from Ayurveda that have the potential to modulate host immune system as well as block the virus entry in host cells by interfering its interaction with cellular receptor and may be used to develop an effective and broad-spectrum strategy for the management of COVID-19 as well as other coronavirus infections in coming future. To decipher the antiviral activity of the selected natural products, molecular docking was performed. Further, the drug-likeness, pharmacokinetics and toxicity parameters of the selected natural products were determined. Docking results suggest that curcumin and nimbin exhibits highest interaction with spike glycoprotein (MolDock score − 141.36 and − 148.621 kcal/mole) and ACE2 receptor (MolDock score − 142.647 and − 140.108 kcal/mole) as compared with other selected natural products/drugs and controls. Also, the pharmacokinetics data illustrated that all selected natural products have better pharmacological properties (low molecular weight; no violation of Lipinski rule of five, good absorption profiles, oral bioavailability, good blood–brain barrier penetration, and low toxicity risk). Our study exhibited that curcumin, nimbin, withaferin A, piperine, mangiferin, thebaine, berberine, and andrographolide have significant binding affinity towards spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptor and may be useful as a therapeutic and/or prophylactic agent for restricting viral attachment to the host cells. However, few other natural products like resveratrol, quercetin, luteolin, naringenin, zingiberene, and gallic acid has the significant binding affinity towards ACE2 receptor only and therefore may be used for ACE2-mediated attachment inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.","Maurya, Vimal K.; Kumar, Swatantra; Prasad, Anil K.; Bhatt, Madan L.

Preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that the (ASM)/ceramide system may be central to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We examined the potential usefulness of FIASMA use among patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19 in an observational multicenter study conducted at Greater Paris University hospitals. Of 2,846 adult patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19, 277 (9.7%) were taking a FIASMA medication at the time of their hospital admission. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation and/or death. We compared this endpoint between patients taking vs. not taking a FIASMA medication in time-to-event analyses adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and medical comorbidities. The primary analysis was a Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting (IPW). Over a mean follow-up of 9.2 days (SD=12.5), the primary endpoint occurred in 104 patients (37.5%) receiving a FIASMA medication, and 1,060 patients (41.4%) who did not. Despite being significantly and substantially associated with older age and greater medical severity, FIASMA medication use was significantly associated with reduced likelihood of intubation or death in both crude (HR=0.71; 95%CI=0.58-0.87; p<0.001) and primary IPW (HR=0.58; 95%CI=0.46-0.72; p<0.001) analyses. This association remained significant in multiple sensitivity analyses and was not specific to one particular FIASMA class or medication. These results show the potential importance of the ASM/ceramide system in COVID-19 and support the continuation of FIASMA medications in these patients.

Our group has recently developed leukocyte-derived nanovesicles, termed leukosomes, able to target in vivo the inflamed vasculature associated with pathological conditions including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and sepsis. Herein, to gain insights on the anti-inflammatory properties of leukosomes, we investigated their ability to reduce uncontrolled inflammation in a lethal model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia, recapitulating the cytokine storm syndrome observed in COVID-19 infection after encapsulating dexamethasone. Treated animals showed a significant survival advantage and an improved immune response resolution, as demonstrated by a cytokine array analysis of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and other immune-relevant markers. Our results showed that leukosomes enhance the therapeutic activity of dexamethasone and better control the inflammatory response compared to the free drug. Such an approach could be useful for the development of personalized therapies in the treatment of hyperinflammation related to infectious diseases, including the ones caused by COVID-19.","Molinaro, Roberto; Pasto, Anna; Taraballi, Francesca; Giordano, Federica; Azzi, Jamil A; Tasciotti, Ennio; Corbo, Claudia",,72,33

Lacking effective therapies and vaccinations, during viral outbreak the major and most incisive mean for viral spread control is spread prevention, especially for the fragile burn-injured patients we are called to care for in Burn Units. METHODS: We developed an admission and inpatient management protocol to preserve burn patients from SARS-CoV-2 contagion, in order to avoid additional morbidity and mortality in patients with already compromised health conditions. Data from burn-injured patients admitted to our Unit following this new protocol were retrospectively analyzed in order to verify its effectiveness in prevention of viral spread. RESULTS: From the 8th of March to the 8th of June, we admitted 18 patients in the Burn Unit ICU and semi-ICU and 17 patients in the Burn Ward. Two of them resulted positive to COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab and bronchoalveolar lavage collected immediately on admission, for both the extension of burns and their general clinical conditions implied ICU admission. Moreover, a caregiver of an admitted child resulted positive to the nasopharyngeal swab. No other cases of SARS-CoV-2 positivity have been reported neither between hospitalized patients nor between healthcare workers. CONCLUSION: The evidence of high ICU admission rate and high mortality in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 combined with the fragile clinical conditions of burn patients required the development of an admission and hospitalization management protocol.","Azzena, Bruno; Perozzo, Filippo Andrea Giovanni; De Lazzari, Alberto; Valotto, Giovanni; Pontini, Alex",Burns,72,1

Although its pathogenesis has not been fully studied, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) has recently been identified as a receptor for entry into the cell of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, thereby contributing to the spread of infection in the body. The goal of the review was to study the significance of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in the pathogenesis of the action of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the function and regulation of ACE 2, and the effects of RAAS inhibitors in cardiovascular diseases. ACE 2 promotes the transformation of angiotensin (AT) I into AT 1–7, which have a number of beneficial effects on the state of endothelium and cardiomyocytes (vasodilation, inhibition of cell growth, inhibition of cell proliferation and inhibition of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy). SARS-CoV-2 virus, in addition to interaction with ACE 2 on the surface cells in the lungs and vascular wall, leads to dysregulation of ACE 2, which in turn leads to a shift in the balance of RAAS towards activation of ACE 1 receptors, which have the opposite effects. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) play a key role in the treatment of major cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and chronic heart failure, and today there is no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARBs worsen severity of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, it is not recommended to discontinue these drugs in patients with stable cardiovascular diseases and afflicted by COVID-19. The human recombinant hrACE 2 protein may be a potential therapy for CVI by blocking virus entry and eliminating the imbalance in RAAS.","Zagidullin, N.Sh.; Gareeva, D.

We sought to explore the challenges and opportunities for supporting and improving the health and wellbeing of international students through interviews with health and other support services staff at an Australian University. Semi-structured interviews with a range of health and support services staff were conducted in person or by telephone in late 2018. Staff were asked about their perceptions of 1) health and wellbeing issues for international students, 2) barriers to international students accessing campus-based services for health and wellbeing concerns, and 3) strategies to improve international students’ health and wellbeing. Transcribed interviews were analysed thematically. Mental health/illness was identified as the most important health and wellbeing concern for international students. Barriers to help-seeking included fear of repercussions for coming forward, lack of problem and symptom recognition, poor understanding of health information, cultural stigma associated with counselling and language barriers. A tendency among international students to delay help-seeking until problems reached crisis-point was also identified as a concern. Suggested strategies to improve wellbeing included pre-departure education/orientation to life in Australia, the integration of health and wellbeing education with other university programs, education about confidentiality, better supporting students in how to access services, and skill building to promote social connection. Addressing the identified issues and opportunities would support international student health and wellbeing and may assist in attracting international students back to Australia post-COVID. © 2021, Australian and New Zealand Student Services Association.

However, the association between D-dimer levels and the severity of COVID-19 is not clear. The study was aimed to investigate the association between D-dimer levels and the severity of COVID-19 based on a cohort study and meta-analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic and clinical data of all confirmed cases with COVID-19 on admission to Tongji Hospital from January 27 to March 5, 2020, were collected and analyzed, and coagulation function parameters were described and compared between patients with severe infection and those with non-severe infection. Cohort studies reporting risk estimates for the D-dimer and severity of COVID-19 association were searched and included to perform a meta-analysis. RESULTS: In our cohort study, patients with severe disease were more likely to exhibit dysregulated coagulation function, and a significantly higher D-dimer level (median 1.8 µg/ml [interquartile range 0.9-4.6] vs 0.5 [0.3-1.1], p < 0.001) was found in severe cases than the mild ones, on admission. In the meta-analysis of 13 cohort studies (including the current study), patients with severe disease had an increase in mean D-dimer value by 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.51-1.31, p < 0.001) µg/ml compared to those with non-severe disease, and odds of severe infection was associated with D-dimer greater than 0.5 µg/ml (odds ratio = 5.78, 95% confidence interval, 2.16-15.44, p < 0.001) on admission.

Further chart review of the same patient cohort was conducted to identify the dates of self-reported onset of coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms and the timing of the peak immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibody levels after symptom onset was visualized using local polynomial regression smoothing on log2-scaled serologic values. To study the neonatal serology response, umbilical cord blood samples of the neonates born to the subset of serology positive pregnant women were tested for serologic antibody responses. The maternal antibody levels of serology positive vs the maternal antibody levels of serology negative neonates were compared using the Welch 2 sample t test. The relationship between the quantitative maternal and quantitative neonatal serologic data was studied using a Pearson correlation and linear regression. A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted using maternal symptoms, maternal serology levels, and maternal use of oxygen support to determine the predictors of neonatal immunoglobulin G levels. RESULTS: A total of 88 serology positive pregnant women were included in this study. The antibody levels were higher in symptomatic pregnant women than in asymptomatic pregnant women. Serology studies in 34 women with symptom onset data revealed that the maternal immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G levels peak around 15 and 30 days after the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms, respectively. Furthermore, studies of 50 neonates born to this subset of serology positive women showed that passive immunity in the form of immunoglobulin G is conferred in 78% of all neonates. The presence of passive immunity is dependent on the maternal antibody levels, and the levels of neonatal immunoglobulin G correlate with maternal immunoglobulin G levels. The maternal immunoglobulin G levels and maternal use of oxygen support were predictive of the neonatal immunoglobulin G levels. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that maternal serologies correlate with symptomatic maternal infection, and higher levels of maternal antibodies are associated with passive neonatal immunity. The maternal immunoglobulin G levels and maternal use of oxygen support, a marker of disease severity, predicted the neonatal immunoglobulin G levels. These data will further guide the screening for this uniquely linked population of mothers and their neonates and can aid in developing maternal vaccination strategies.","Kubiak, Jeffrey M; Murphy, Elisabeth A; Yee, Jim; Cagino, Kristen A; Friedlander, Rachel L; Glynn, Shannon M; Matthews, Kathy C; Jurkiewicz, Magdalena; Sukhu, Ashley C; Zhao, Zhen; Prabhu, Malavika; Riley, Laura E; Yang, Yawei J",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,72,16

STUDY DESIGN: Observational. SAMPLE POPULATION: Second-year veterinary students (n = 143) enrolled in a surgical laboratory; 9 weeks were taught traditionally, and 6 weeks were taught remotely. METHODS: Because of the global pandemic, remote laboratories were developed and delivered. Students performed surgical procedures in model organs remotely while being observed by and receiving feedback from instructors on an internet-based video platform. Methods for remote surgical teaching were explored, and successes and challenges were detailed. Surveys were administered to the students and faculty to gather perspectives on their experience and subsequent confidence. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 81 of 143 (57%) students and seven of seven (100%) instructors. The mean overall student satisfaction score (1 not at all satisfied, 10 very satisfied) for in-person instruction was 8.2, and the mean score for remote instruction was 6.2 (P < .001). Overall, the instructors had a mean satisfaction score of 8 for in-person laboratories and a mean satisfaction score of 6 for remotely taught laboratories. Most students had a perception of greater one-on-one instructor attention in remote laboratories. Students reported similar confidence levels for three surgical procedures. CONCLUSION: The described remote teaching method resulted in the perception of greater instructor attention given to students. Student and instructor satisfaction was lower with remote teaching than with in-person teaching. IMPACT: The described method of remote teaching may be applied to teaching surgical students in settings when face-to-face instruction cannot be achieved and may be developed further to create an experience equivalent to face-to-face instruction.","Thieman Mankin, Kelley M; Cornell, Karen; Peycke, Laura; Dickerson, Vanna; Scallan, Elizabeth",Vet Surg,72,16

This work aims to understand the thought of the youth, their opinions and understanding of various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology: Using a combined qualitative-quantitative approach, Q-method, we tried to assess people's discernment from different perspectives. This was done through a questionnaire survey method during the national-level lockdown 1.0 in India. Results: We have differentiated the perceptions of youth respondents into seven factors, including six subdimensions, on COVID-19 pandemic (viz., science, society, environment, economy, politics, and religion). The choices and opinions have been segregated into two major groups: quantitative and qualitative. Conclusion: This work yielded a firsthand ground-level insight into the comprehensive yet diverse responses from youths regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in India. There are various topics that arise from this study, for example, misinformation, misinterpretation of science, dubious nature of faith in governance and policy, turbid understanding of strategy, polarization of opinion, and so forth. Following this work of identification, the next steps would be to understand how to mitigate the problems toward betterment in the COVID-19 pandemic situation or similar widespread crisis events in the foreseeable future.","Basu, Aman; Roy, Ajishnu; Hazra, Amit Kumar; Pramanick, Kousik",Social science quarterly,72,16

However, from the epidemiological point of view, the dimension of the problem is still unknown, since the number of actual cases of SARS-CoV-2 infected people is underestimated, due to limited testing. This paper aims at estimating the actual Infection Fatality Ratio (number of deaths with respect to the number of infected people) and the actual current prevalence (number of infected people with respect to the entire population), both in a specific population and all over the world. With this aim, this paper proposes a method to estimate Infection Fatality Ratio of a still ongoing infection, based on a daily estimation, and on the relationship between this estimation and the number of tests performed per death. The method has been applied using data about COVID-19 from Italy. Results show a fatality ratio of about 0.9%, which is lower than previous findings. The number of actual infected people in Italy is also estimated, and results show that (i) infection started at the end of January 2020; (ii) a maximum number of about 100,000 new cases in one day was reached at the beginning of March 2020; (iii) the estimated cumulative number of infections at the beginning of October 2020 is about 4.2 million cases in Italy (more than 120 million worldwide, if a generalization is conjectured as reasonable). Therefore, the prevalence at the beginning of October 2020 is estimated at about 6.9% in Italy (1.6% worldwide, if a generalization is conjectured).","Pota, Marco; Pota, Andrea; Sirico, Maria Luisa; Esposito, Massimo",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),72,1

However, the efficacy of these treatments was not validated on either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. In this study, we have reviewed synthetic evidence achieved through systematic and meta-analysis of therapeutics specific for SARS-CoV-2 and observed that the use of the above-mentioned therapies had no clinical benefits in coronavirus disease 2019 patients and, conversely, displayed side effects.","Sabeerabi, B.; Vemula, S.; Vadde, R.; Nagaraju, G.

METHODS: A systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and gray literature from inception through January 31, 2020, was performed. Original articles with > 10 patients evaluating the accuracy of DECT for detecting BME in the appendicular skeleton with a reference standard of MRI and/or clinical follow-up were included. Study details were independently extracted by two reviewers. Meta-analysis was performed using a bivariate random-effects model with multivariable meta-regression. Risk of bias (RoB) was evaluated with QUADAS-2. RESULTS: Twenty studies evaluating 790 patients for BME in the appendicular skeleton were included in analysis. The summary sensitivity, specificity, and AUC values for BME in the appendicular skeleton were 86% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82-89%), 93% (95% CI 90-95%), and 0.95, respectively. Quantitative analysis had a higher sensitivity than qualitative analysis on meta-regression (p = 0.01), but no difference in specificity (p = 0.28). No other covariates contributed to variability in accuracy (etiology (trauma vs non-trauma); location (upper vs lower extremity); and RoB). Studies demonstrated generally low or unclear RoB and applicability. Eight studies included index tests with high RoB when quantitative assessments used a retrospective cut-off value. CONCLUSIONS: DECT demonstrates a higher specificity than sensitivity and AUC > 0.9. In scenarios where MRI availability is limited or contraindicated, DECT could be an alternative to MRI for detecting BME in the appendicular skeleton. However, limitations in sources of variability and RoB warrant continued study.

Our objective was to systematically review recent literature reporting estimates of the distribution of the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 and describe the distribution and its variability and dispersion through a meta-analysis. METHODS: A systematic review was carried out on studies published from 1 January 2020 to 10 January 2021 reporting the SARS-CoV-2 incubation period. Individual mean and standard deviation were used to produce the pooled estimate. Sources of heterogeneity were explored by age, gender and study design using a meta-regression. RESULTS: In total, 99 studies were eligible for analysis in our meta-analysis. The pooled estimate of the mean incubation period across the studies was 6.38 days, 95% CI (5.79; 6.97). CONCLUSION: Calculation of the mean incubation period will help with the identification of time of exposure, however, determinants of its variations/range might be explored for potential links with the clinical outcome or pathogenic steps at the early stage of infection.

However, development of treatment failure and drug resistance raises concern over lifelong treatments to chronic diseases such as HIV/AIDS. Objectives: This study determined proportion of treatment failure (TF) and identified factors associated with TF among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Bahir Dar, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods: Facility based cross sectional study was carried out from November, 2017 to April, 2018. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected using structured questioner. Blood sample was collected and analyzed for viral load, complete blood count (CBC), liver and kidney function test and CD4 count. A patient is declared as treatment failure when viral load value is higher than 1000 RNA copies/ml in two consecutive viral load analyses within three months interval. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 23. To identify factors associated with TF, logistic regressions model was employed. Results: A total of 430 people who had six months and above antiretroviral treatment (ART) follow up were enrolled in the study. Of these, 57.9% were females & the mean age was 38 years. The mean month of ART follow up was 83 months. In the first viral load analysis, 106 (24.7%) of the cohort were virologically failed. These failed people were followed for 3 months with intensive adherence support; then second viral load analysis showed a viralogical failure among 65 people of the second cohort. Thus, the overall viralogical failure or TF was 15.1%. The re-suppression rates were 41(38.7%). Male gender, people with history of drug discontinuation, poor adherence, irregular time of drug intake, multiple sexual practice showed significant association with TF. Moreover, base line and current CD4 counts of <200 cells/ml also demonstrated significant association with TF. Conclusion: Significant proportion of treatment failure was reported in the present study. Moreover, behavioral factors such as drug discontinuation, poor adherence, multiple sexual partner were associated with treatment failure. Hence, to avoid TF, regular patient counseling and monitoring should be in place. To identify the predictors for treatment failure, further follow-up study is desirable.","Genet, Andualem; Mekonnen, Zewdie; Yizengaw, Endalew; Mekonnen, Daniel",Afr Health Sci,72,1

A safe, effective vaccine is urgently needed and remains a global health priority. Subunit vaccines are used successfully against other viruses when administered in the presence of an effective adjuvant. METHODS: We evaluated three different clinically tested adjuvant systems in combination with the SARS-CoV-2 pre-fusion stabilized (S-2P) spike protein using a one-dose regimen in mice. FINDINGS: Whilst spike protein alone was only weakly immunogenic, the addition of either Aluminum hydroxide, a squalene based oil-in-water emulsion system (SE) or a cationic liposome-based adjuvant significantly enhanced antibody responses against the spike receptor binding domain (RBD). Kinetics of antibody responses differed, with SE providing the most rapid response. Neutralizing antibodies developed after a single immunization in all adjuvanted groups with ID50 titers ranging from 86-4063. Spike-specific CD4 T helper responses were also elicited, comprising mainly of IFN-Î³ and IL-17 producing cells in the cationic liposome adjuvanted group, and more IL-5- and IL-10-secreting cells in the AH group. INTERPRETATION: These results demonstrate that adjuvanted spike protein subunit vaccine is a viable strategy for rapidly eliciting SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and CD4 T cell responses of various qualities depending on the adjuvant used, which can be explored in further vaccine development against COVID-19.

Hence, we elaborated on the relationship between ß-catenin expression and BC through a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. As of March 2020, EMBASE, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Science Direct/Elsevier, MEDLINE and CNKI were used for systematic literature retrieval to investigate the correlation between ß-catenin expression and BC. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager and Stata software. Fourteen studies were included, including 865 BC tissues and 106 controls. Combined ORs were identified with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) in a random- or fixed-effects model. We illustrated that there was a significant correlation between ß-catenin and BC, that there was abnormally high expression of ß-catenin in BC tissues compared with normal bladder tissues (P<0.05), and that the combined OR was 14.69[5.73, 37.65]. Furthermore, the aberrant expression rates of ß-catenin in high-grade and invasive bladder neoplasm tissues were greater than those in low-grade and non-muscle-invasive bladder tissues (P<0.05), and the combined ORs were 0.31[0.23, 0.43] and 0.21[0.15, 0.29]. Finally, we found through meta-analysis that the higher the expression level of ß-catenin, the shorter was the progression-free survival of patients with BC (P<0.05), and the combined OR was 2.74[1.22, 6.14]. This study suggests that the abnormal expression of ß-catenin is associated with aggressive behavior and poor prognosis of BC, and ß-catenin may be a molecular marker of the malignant degree and poor prognosis of BC.","Ren, Jin; Yang, Yaodong; Peng, Taifang; Xu, Dong",Biosci. rep,72,1

The aim of this study was to describe the association between nutritional risk and length of stay, days on mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: a retrospective cohort of ventilated, critically ill patients. We assessed nutrition risk at baseline using NUTRIC-score. Logistic and linear regression models were used to analyze the association between NUTRIC-score and clinical outcomes (days on mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, and in-hospital mortality). A survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves. Results: a total of 112 patients were included, 39.3 % were overweight and 47.3 % were obese. Based on NUTRIC-Score, 66 % and 34 % of patients were at high and low nutritional risk, respectively. High nutritional risk was associated with increased mortality risk (OR: 2.4, 95 % CI, 1.06-5.47, p = 0.036) and higher 28-day mortality (HR: 2.05, 95 % CI, 1.01-4.23, p = 0.04) in comparison with low risk. Conclusion: high nutritional risk is related to mortality in SARS-CoV-2 critically ill patients. Overweight and obesity are common in this sample.

Colloidal growth techniques, such as antisolvent precipitation, form dispersions with properties that match bulk layered R-P phases, but controlling the composition of these particles remains challenging. Here, we explore the microstructure of particles of R-P phases of methylammonium lead iodide prepared by antisolvent precipitation from ternary mixtures of alkylammonium cations, where one cation can form perovskite phases (CH3NH3+) and the other two promote layered structures as spacers (e.g., C4H9NH3+ and C12H25NH3+). We determine that alkylammonium spacers pack with constant methylene density in the R-P interlayer and exclude interlayer solvent in dispersed colloids, regardless of length or branching. Using this result, we illustrate how the competition between cations that act as spacers between layers, or as grain-terminating ligands, determines the colloidal microstructure of layered R-P crystallites in solution. Optical measurements reveal that quantum well dimensions can be tuned by engineering the ternary cation composition. Transmission synchrotron wide-angle X-ray scattering and small-angle neutron scattering reveal changes in the structure of colloids in solvent and after deposition into thin films. In particular, we find that spacers can alloy between R-P layers if they share common steric arrangements, but tend to segregate into polydisperse R-P phases if they do not mix. This study provides a framework to compare the microstructure of colloidal layered perovskites and suggests clear avenues to control phase and colloidal morphology.","Dahlman, Clayton J; Venkatesan, Naveen R; Corona, Patrick T; Kennard, Rhys M; Mao, Lingling; Smith, Noah C; Zhang, Jiamin; Seshadri, Ram; Helgeson, Matthew E; Chabinyc, Michael L",ACS nano,72,16

The specific recognition during the binding of the spike glycoprotein (S protein) of coronavirus to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the host cell is widely considered the first step of infection. However, detailed insights on the underlying mechanism of dynamic recognition and binding of these two proteins remain unknown. In this work, molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy calculation were carried out to systematically compare and analyze the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of six coronavirus' S proteins. We found that affinity and stability of the RBD from SARS-CoV-2 under the binding state with ACE2 are stronger than those of other coronaviruses. The solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) and binding free energy of different RBD subunits indicate an ""anchor-locker"" recognition mechanism involved in the binding of the S protein to ACE2. Loop 2 (Y473-F490) acts as an anchor for ACE2 recognition, and Loop 3 (G496-V503) locks ACE2 at the other nonanchoring end. Then, the charged or long-chain residues in the ß-sheet 1 (N450-F456) region reinforce this binding. The proposed binding mechanism was supported by umbrella sampling simulation of the dissociation process. The current computational study provides important theoretical insights for the development of new vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.","Cong, Yalong; Feng, Yinghui; Ni, Hui; Zhi, Fengdong; Miao, Yulu; Fang, Bohuan; Zhang, Lujia; Zhang, John Z H",J Chem Inf Model,72,16

Methods and Results The study sample consisted of 1227 participants from the 2009-2016 Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi project (south Texas, United States) who had first-ever ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage and survived 90 days after stroke. Poststroke cognitive function was assessed by the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE) (range: 0-100; dementia: <78). The associations of sex with dichotomized and continuous outcomes were examined using logistic regression and tobit regression, respectively. Inverse probability weighting and multiple imputation were used to deal with missing data. The study sample was evenly distributed by sex, and primarily composed of Mexican Americans (59.1%) and non-Hispanic whites (34.1%). Women scored 2.96 points worse on the 3MSE than men at 90 days poststroke (95% CI, -3.99 to -1.93). The prevalence of dementia was 27.6% for men (95% CI, 23.5%-31.6%) and 35.6% for women (95% CI, 31.5%-39.7%), and the unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of dementia comparing women with men was 1.45 (95% CI, 1.24-1.69). The association was attenuated after adjustment for sociodemographic, stroke, and prestroke characteristics (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.61-1.09). Conclusions Women had worse cognitive outcomes than men at 90 days poststroke. The differences were attributable to sociodemographic and prestroke characteristics, especially widowhood status. Potential mechanisms linking widowhood to dementia in the acute poststroke stage warrant further investigation to inform interventions addressing the unique care needs of women stroke survivors with dementia and cognitive dysfunction.","Dong, Liming; Briceno, Emily; Morgenstern, Lewis B; Lisabeth, Lynda D",J Am Heart Assoc,72,3

Due to its high conservativeness and low similarity with human genes, SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M$^{\text{pro}}$) is one of the most favorable drug targets. However, the current understanding of the molecular mechanism of M$^{\text{pro}}$ inhibition is limited by the lack of reliable binding affinity ranking and prediction of existing structures of M$^{\text{pro}}$-inhibitor complexes. This work integrates mathematics and deep learning (MathDL) to provide a reliable ranking of the binding affinities of 92 SARS-CoV-2 M$^{\text{pro}}$ inhibitor structures. We reveal that Gly143 residue in M$^{\text{pro}}$ is the most attractive site to form hydrogen bonds, followed by Cys145, Glu166, and His163. We also identify 45 targeted covalent bonding inhibitors. Validation on the PDBbind v2016 core set benchmark shows the MathDL has achieved the top performance with Pearson's correlation coefficient ($R_p$) being 0.858. Most importantly, MathDL is validated on a carefully curated SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor dataset with the averaged $R_p$ as high as 0.751, which endows the reliability of the present binding affinity prediction.

It is argued that developing more sensitive, easy to administer, and valid MCI screening tools for use in primary care settings may initiate timely clinical and personal care planning and treatment, enabling early access to programs and services. Including functional competence measures in screening tests makes them more ecologically valid and may help to identify cognitive deficits at an earlier stage. OBJECTIVE: We aim to conduct a preliminary evaluative study comparing the sensitivity, specificity, and reliability of the BrainFx Screen (referred to as SCREEN hereafter), a novel digital tool designed to assess functional competence and detect early signs of cognitive impairment, with the Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment, a validated and highly sensitive tool that detects MCI in the older adult population. We will also investigate the perceived usefulness and integration of the SCREEN into primary care practice to identify demonstrable impacts on clinical workflow and health care providers' (HCP) perceptions of its success as a screening tool. Patients' perceptions of completing the SCREEN and its impact on their quality of life will also be explored. METHODS: This study has a concurrent, mixed methods, prospective, and quasi-experimental design. Participants will be recruited from 5 primary care family health teams (FHTs; defined by multidisciplinary practice and capitated funding) across southwestern Ontario, Canada. Participants will include HCPs, patients, care partners, and FHT administrative executives. Patients 55 years and older with no history of diagnoses for MCI, dementia, or Alzheimer disease rostered in one of the FHTs participating in the study will be eligible to participate. Their care partners will help triangulate the qualitative data collected from patients. Participating FHTs will identify an occupational therapist from their site to participate in the study; this HCP will both administer the research protocol and participate in semistructured in-depth interviews and questionnaires. Principal component analysis will be conducted on the SCREEN data to understand the test components better. Tests comparing sensitivity, specificity, and test-retest reliability will assess the validity of SCREEN as a screening tool for MCI. RESULTS: This paper describes the study protocol and its activities to date. Data collection was halted early because of COVID-19 restrictions on research activity, and data analysis is currently in progress. CONCLUSIONS: At the end of the project, we anticipate having an initial comparative evaluation of the SCREEN as a tool for early detection of MCI in primary care older adult patient populations. Resource constraints on this research study limit our ability to conduct a randomized controlled trial; however, the results will assist developers of the SCREEN in determining whether rigorous controlled testing is warranted.

The B-cell and T-cell epitopes used for the construction of vaccine were antigenic, nonallergic and nontoxic. An adjuvant, ß-defensin and PADRE sequence were included at the N-terminal end of the vaccine. All the epitopes were joined by linkers for decreasing the junctional immunogenicity. Various physicochemical parameters of the vaccine were evaluated. Secondary and tertiary structures were predicted for the vaccine construct. The tertiary structure was further refined, and various parameters related to the refinement of the protein structure were validated by using different tools. Humoral immunity induced by B-cells relies upon the identification of antigenic determinants on the surface of the vaccine construct. In this regard, the vaccine construct was found to consist of several B-cell epitopes in its three-dimensional conformation. Molecular docking of the vaccine was carried out with TLR-3 receptor to study their binding and its strength. Further, protein-protein interactions in the docked complex were visualized using LigPlot+. Population coverage analysis had shown that the multi-epitope vaccine covers 94.06% of the global population. The vaccine construct was successfully cloned in silico into pET-28a (+). Immune simulation studies showed the induction of primary, secondary and tertiary immune responses marked by the increased levels of antibodies, INF-Î³, IL-2, TGF-ß, B- cells, CD4+ and CD8+ cells.

Studies using digital data sources show that the mobility of individuals was effectively reduced in multiple countries. However, it remains unclear whether these reductions caused deeper structural changes in mobility networks and how such changes may affect dynamic processes on the network. Here we use movement data of mobile phone users to show that mobility in Germany has not only been reduced considerably: Lockdown measures caused substantial and long-lasting structural changes in the mobility network. We find that long-distance travel was reduced disproportionately strongly. The trimming of long-range network connectivity leads to a more local, clustered network and a moderation of the ""small-world"" effect. We demonstrate that these structural changes have a considerable effect on epidemic spreading processes by ""flattening"" the epidemic curve and delaying the spread to geographically distant regions.","Schlosser, Frank; Maier, Benjamin F; Jack, Olivia; Hinrichs, David; Zachariae, Adrian; Brockmann, Dirk",Proc.

Currently, there are no definitive recommendations as to the timing and dosing of prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. In this manuscript, we report a case of SARS-CoV2-mediated hypercoagulability and review the literature pertaining to the incidence and pathophysiology of coronavirus-mediated coagulopathies. A 64-year-old female, with a medical history of hypothyroidism and remote tobacco abuse, presented to the ED with fever and nonproductive cough. She had multiple negative SARS-CoV2 nasopharyngeal PCR tests during her hospital stay, but chest imaging and elevated inflammatory markers were suggestive of SARS-CoV2 infection. Computed tomography showed a left upper lobe pulmonary embolism with associated right heart strain, and an enlargement of the main pulmonary artery, for which she was initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin. Despite the medical management of her pulmonary embolism and conservative management of her SARS-CoV2, her clinical condition worsened requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. After seven days, she was successfully extubated and was transferred to the medical service where her clinical course remained stable and subsequently discharged home on apixaban. In patients with SARS-CoV1-, SARS-CoV2-, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-mediated hypercoagulability, the risk of thrombosis appears to be multifactorial - direct viral cytopathological effects, a pro-inflammatory state, cytokine storm, hypoxia-inducible thrombosis, and endothelial inflammation culminating in the formation of intra-alveolar or systemic fibrin clots. While initial guidelines have been developed to assist clinicians in selecting appropriate chemoprophylaxis as well as therapeutic anticoagulation, a consensus statement remains lacking. Further studies are needed to evaluate the pathogenesis and treatment of coronavirus-induced thrombosis.","Singh, Shalinder; Zuwasti, Ufara; Haas, Christopher",Cureus,72,16

We reviewed hospital visitor restriction policies for consistency and to develop recommendations to highlight fair and transparent restrictions, exceptions, and appeals in policy development and implementation. DESIGN: Collection and analysis of public-facing visitor restriction policies during the first 3 months of the pandemic. SETTING: General acute care hospitals representing 23 states across all 4 major regions of the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of the 70 largest hospitals by total bed capacity. MEASUREMENTS: Characteristics of visitor restriction policies including general visitor restriction statement, changes/updates to policies over time, exceptions to policies, and restrictions specific to COVID-19-positive patients. RESULTS: Sixty-five of the 70 hospitals reviewed had public-facing visitor restriction policies. Forty-nine of these 65 policies had general ""no-visitor"" statements, whereas 16 allowed at least 1 visitor to accompany all patients. Sixty-three of 65 hospitals included exceptions to their visitor restriction policies. Setting-specific exceptions included pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, emergency department, behavioral health, inpatient rehabilitation, surgery, and outpatient clinics. Exceptions that applied across settings included patients at end of life and patients with disabilities. CONCLUSION: Visitor restriction policies varied significantly among hospitals in this review. These variances create challenges in that their fair application may be problematic and ethical issues related to allocation may arise. Five recommendations are offered for hospitals revising or creating such policies, including that offering transparent, accessible, public-facing policies can minimize ethical dilemmas. In addition, hospitals would benefit from communicating with each other in the development of visitor policies to ensure uniformity and support patients and family members as they navigate hospital visitation.","Jaswaney, Rohit; Davis, Arlene; Cadigan, R Jean; Waltz, Margaret; Brassfield, Elizabeth R; Forcier, Bex; Joyner, Benny L",J. public health manag. pract.

In this survey paper, we describe how the internet is transforming the mathematics classroom and mathematics teacher education. We use as references several reviews of use of the internet in mathematics education settings made in recent years to determine how the field has evolved. We identify three domains in which new approaches are being generated by mathematic educators: principles of design of new settings; social interaction and construction knowledge; and tools and resources. The papers in this issue reflect different perspectives developed in the last decade in these three domains, providing evidence of the advances in theoretical frameworks and support in the generation of new meanings for old constructs such as 'tool', 'resources' or 'learning setting'. We firstly highlight the different ways in which the use of digital technologies generates new ways of thinking about mathematics and the settings in which it is learnt, and how mathematics teacher educators frame the new initiatives of initial training and professional development.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective, observational study on the Portuguese Pharmacovigilance System database, between 03/2020 and 12/2020. We selected Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) reports that contained Hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir as suspected drugs and excluded reports that contained more than one drug as suspected of causing ADR. The analyses performed for each drug under study were as follows: (1) seriousness, (2) type of ADR – Preferred Term hierarchy level coding, according to the MedDRA, (3) description of ADR in the SmPC and (4) characteristics of the patient (age and sex). Results: Of the 147 ADR reports, 61 (41.5%) are to Hydroxychloroquine, and 87 (58.5%) are to Remdesivir. Regarding the seriousness criteria, there was a percentage of seriousness reports above 80% in both groups. For Hydroxychloroquine, the five most frequent ADRs were: cholestasis (23.2%), hepatocellular injury (14.7%), condition aggravated (8.4%), pancytopenia (4.2%) and QT prolonged electrocardiogram (4.2%). 90% of these ADRs are described in the SmPC. Looking at Remdesivir, the five most frequent ADRs were: increased transaminases (21.7%), renal impairment (9.6%), alanine aminotransferase increased (7.0%), blood creatinine increased (4.35%) and bradycardia (4.35%). Regarding the description of ADRs for this drug in the SmPC, only 38% are described. For both drugs, male patients are the ones who have more ADR (54% for Hydroxychloroquine and 68% for Remdesivir), and the average age is higher in patients taking Hidoxychloroquine (68 years;SD 16 years) than in patients taking Remdesivir (62 years;SD 18 years).

Available interventions to help adolescents improve their stress responses, however, have not been effective in rigorous evaluation studies, or they have been difficult to administer widely. Here we show that replicable improvements in adolescent stress responses can be achieved with a short (~30-minute), scalable synergistic mindsets intervention. This intervention, which is a self-administered online training module, targets both growth mindsets (the idea that people's intelligence can be developed in response to challenge) and stress-can-be-enhancing mindsets (the idea that people's stress responses can be fuel for optimal performance). Its goal is to promote positive engagement with stressful events (e.g., learning from failure on a quiz or a conflict with a peer) and to encourage adolescents to use their responses to stressful events and even their bodily symptoms (e.g. racing heart, sweaty palms, butterflies in their stomach) to their advantage. In five double-blind, randomized, controlled trials (total N = 4,091 adolescents), the new synergistic mindsets intervention improved stress-related cognitions (Studies 1-2), cardiovascular reactivity (Study 3), daily internalizing symptoms and cortisol levels (Study 4), and generalized anxiety symptoms during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns (Study 5). Effects on downstream outcomes (in Studies 3-5) were stronger among individuals who, at baseline, held the two negative mindsets targeted by the intervention, providing evidence for the proposed mechanisms. Confidence in this conclusion comes from a conservative, Bayesian machine-learning method for detecting heterogeneity.","Yeager, D.; Bryan, C.; Gross, J.; Krettek, D.; Santos, P.; Murray, J.; Graveling, H.; Johnson, M.; Jamieson, J.",,72,16

In this preclinical investigation, forty-five female immature Wistar rats were randomized in 5 groups. The control group received subcutaneous saline injections. The other groups received Everolimus, Everolimus plus Verapamil, Everolimus plus Fisetin, and Fisetin alone. Primary and secondary outcomes were measured in the left ovary after a treatment period of 8 weeks. Ten days later, animals received 35 IU FSH for 4 days and 35 IU of hCG on the 5th day. The same parameters were examined in the right ovary. AMH, estradiol, and progesterone levels were assessed at the end of both interventions. Significantly, more primordial and less atretic follicles were observed in the Everolimus plus Verapamil group. AMH and progesterone levels were substantially lower in the Everolimus group. Interestingly, after ovarian stimulation higher levels of AMH and progesterone were observed in the Everolimus plus Verapamil group. Immunoblot analysis of ovarian extracts revealed that the administration of Everolimus led to a significant reduction in the mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of the 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1. This decrease was reversed in the presence of FSH after stopping drug administration. The expression of the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl2 as well as of LC3-II and ATG12 was increased after removal of the Everolimus plus Verapamil combination, indicating reduced apoptosis and increased autophagy, whereas the levels of the proliferation marker PCNA in the granulosa cells were elevated, consistent with initiation of follicular growth.Thus, the combination of Everolimus plus Verapamil is capable of increasing the number of competent primordial follicles while reducing atresia.","Pargianas, Michail; Kosmas, Ioannis; Papageorgiou, Kyriaki; Kitsou, Chrysoula; Papoudou-Bai, Alexandra; Batistatou, Anna; Markoula, Sofia; Salta, Styliani; Dalkalitsis, Alexandros; Kolibianakis, Stratis; Tarlatzis, Basil C; Georgiou, Ioannis; Michaelidis, Theologos M",Mol.

Gamma sterilization is attractive for PPE reuse because it can sterilize large quantities of material through hermetically sealed packaging, providing safety and logistic benefits. The Gamma Irradiation Facility at Sandia National Laboratories was used to irradiate N95 filtering facepiece respirators to a sterilization dose of 25 kGy(tissue). Aerosol particle filtration performance testing and electrostatic field measurements were used to determine the efficacy of the respirators after irradiation. Both respirator models exhibited statistically significant decreases in particle filtering efficiencies and electrostatic potential after irradiation. The largest decrease in capture efficiency was 40-50% and peaked near the 200 nm particle size. The key contribution of this effort is correlating the electrostatic potential change of individual filtration layer of the respirator with the decrease filtration efficiency after irradiation. This observation occurred in both variations of N95 respirator that we tested. Electrostatic potential measurement of the filtration layer is a key indicator for predicting filtration efficiency loss.","DeAngelis, Haedi E; Grillet, Anne M; Nemer, Martin B; Wasiolek, Maryla A; Hanson, Don J; Omana, Michael A; Sanchez, Andres L; Vehar, David W; Thelen, Paul M",PLoS One,72,16

METHODS: We examined the impact of COVID-19 on household and child food security in three preexisting, longitudinal, Latinx urban cohorts in the San Francisco Bay Area (N = 375 households, 1875 individuals). Households were initially recruited during pregnancy and postpartum at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG) and UCSF Benioff prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. For this COVID-19 sub-study, participants responded to a 15-min telephonic interview. Participants answered 18 questions from the US Food Security Food Module (US HFSSM) and questions on types of food consumption, housing and employment status, and history of COVID-19 infection as per community or hospital-based testing. Food security and insecurity levels were compared with prior year metrics. RESULTS: We found low levels of household food security in Latinx families (by cohort: 29.2%;34.2%;60.0%) and child food security (56.9%, 54.1%, 78.0%) with differences between cohorts explained by self-reported levels of education and employment status. Food security levels were much lower than those reported previously in two cohorts where data had been recorded from prior years. Reported history of COVID-19 infection in households was 4.8% (95% Confidence Interval (CI);1.5-14.3%);7.2% (95%CI, 3.6-13.9%) and 3.5% (95%CI, 1.7-7.2%) by cohort and was associated with food insecurity in the two larger cohorts (p = 0.03;p = 0.01 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Latinx families in the Bay Area with children are experiencing a sharp rise in food insecurity levels during the COVID-19 epidemic. Food insecurity, similar to other indices of poverty, is associated with increased risk for COVID-19 infection. Comprehensive interventions are needed to address food insecurity in Latinx populations and further studies are needed to better assess independent associations between household food insecurity, poor nutritional health and risk of COVID-19 infection.","Escobar, M.; Mendez, A.

An important feature of syndecan-1 related to its role in pathologies is that it can be shed from the surface of cells as an intact ectodomain composed of the extracellular core protein and attached heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains. Shed syndecan-1 remains functional and impacts cell behavior both locally and distally from its cell of origin. Shedding of syndecan-1 is initiated by a variety of stimuli and accomplished predominantly by the action of matrix metalloproteinases. The accessibility of these proteases to the core protein of syndecan-1 is enhanced, and shedding facilitated, when the heparan sulfate chains of syndecan-1 have been shortened by the enzymatic activity of heparanase. Interestingly, heparanase also enhances shedding by upregulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinases. Recent studies have revealed that heparanase-induced syndecan-1 shedding contributes to the pathogenesis and progression of cancer and viral infection, as well as other septic and non-septic inflammatory states. This review discusses the heparanase/shed syndecan-1 axis in disease pathogenesis and progression, the potential of targeting this axis therapeutically, and the possibility that this axis is widespread and of influence in many diseases.","Rangarajan, Sunil; Richter, Jillian R; Richter, Robert P; Bandari, Shyam K; Tripathi, Kaushlendra; Vlodavsky, Israel; Sanderson, Ralph D",J Histochem Cytochem,72,16

Method: Students enrolled in core clinical clerkships at the UC San Diego School of Medicine from March to April 2020 were sent an anonymous online survey, assessing components of remote learning curricula via quantitative rating and free-response questions. Results: Of 132 students enrolled, 96 (73%) completed the survey. Online question banks, remote progress reviews, and telehealth sessions were rated as the most valuable resources, while textbooks were rated least valuable. Most students felt that the number of resources was adequate (69/94, 74%), the quantity of required content was appropriate (77/93, 83%), and there was a good balance of rigidity versus flexibility in the schedule (81/94, 86%).

In narrative reflections, students valued the flexibility afforded by remote curricula but desired some weekly structure. Students enjoyed expanded access to learning resources and participating in interactive remote sessions. Students expressed anxiety about the pandemic and uncertainty regarding medical education, but transparent communication from clerkship directors helped assuage these concerns. Conclusions: Student participation in direct patient care is fundamental to medical school core clerkships and was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

We share the experiences of the South Australian Ambulance Service (SAAS) MedSTAR Emergency Medical Retrieval Service in preparing for the COVID-19 pandemic in the pre-hospital and retrieval setting - including the role of a multidisciplinary leadership team; challenges and potential approaches to screening for COVID-19; personal protective equipment for pre-hospital and aeromedical taskings; issues arising with interstate retrievals; and the role of telehealth. Although novel solutions allowed SAAS MedSTAR to continue to deliver high-quality care, considering the resource implications involved in undertaking the transfer of patients with COVID-19, it is clear that significant community disease transmission threatens to overwhelm any PHRM service. Should Australia face a significant future outbreak, it is conceivable that some PHRM operations may need to be reduced or suspended entirely.","Alderson, Steven; Paddock, Sharon; West, Nathan; Pearce, Andrew; Martin, Daniel; Keir, Amy",Emerg. med Australas,72,14

It is beyond any doubt that it is, again, a call-to-action to minimize the risk of future zoonoses caused by emerging human pathogens. The primary response to contain zoonotic diseases is to call for more strict regulations on wildlife trade and hunting. This is because the origins of coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as well as other viral pathogens (e.g., Ebola, HIV) are traceable to wild animals. Although COVID-19 is not related to livestock animals, the pandemic increased general attention given to zoonotic viral infections-the risk of which can also be associated with livestock. Therefore, this paper discusses the potential transformation of industrial livestock farming and the production of animal products, particularly meat, to decrease the risks for transmission of novel human pathogens. Plant-based diets have a number of advantages, but it is unrealistic to consider them as the only solution offered to the problem. Therefore, a search for alternative protein sources in insect-based foods and cultured meat, important technologies enabling safer meat production. Although both of these strategies offer a number of potential advantages, they are also subject to the number of challenges that are discussed in this paper. Importantly, insect-based foods and cultured meat can provide additional benefits in the context of ecological footprint, an aspect important in light of predicted climate changes. Furthermore, cultured meat can be regarded as ethically superior and supports better food security. There is a need to further support the implementation and expansion of all three approaches discussed in this paper, plant-based diets, insect-based foods, and cultured meat, to decrease the epidemiological risks and ensure a sustainable future. Furthermore, cultured meat also offers a number of additional benefits in the context of environmental impact, ethical issues, and food security.","Rzymski, Piotr; Kulus, Magdalena; Jankowski, Maurycy; Dompe, Claudia; Bryl, Rut; Petitte, James N; Kempisty, Bartosz; Mozdziak, Paul",Nutrients,72,24

This study aimed to evaluate the adjuvant efficacy of Natural Herbal Medicine (NHM) combined with Western medicine in the treatment of COVID-19. We performed a retrospective, 1:1 matched, case-control study of the first cohort of hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed cases (January 17, 2020 to January 28, 2020). A total of 22 of the 36 confirmed patients were included in this study, split into two groups of 11: the NHM group (NHM combined standard Western medicine treatment) and control group (standard Western medicine treatment alone). All patients received appropriate supportive care and regular clinical and laboratory monitoring. Main evaluation indicators included improvement of clinical symptoms such as fever, cough and diarrhea after hospitalization; pathogen nucleic acid test result of respiratory tract and fecal specimens of the patient after hospitalization, and change of chest CT examination after hospitalization. The duration of fever in the NHM group ([Formula: see text] days) was significantly shorter than that in the control group ([Formula: see text] days) ([Formula: see text]). During the whole hospitalization period, the number of cases with diarrhea in the NHM group (two cases) was less than that in the control group (eight cases) ([Formula: see text]). Compared with the control group ([Formula: see text]), the duration for improvement (DI) of chest CT in the NHM group ([Formula: see text]) was significantly shorter ([Formula: see text]).

This time, all infection waves that occurred repeatedly from February 2020 to September 2021 were simulated by developing the last work. The entire waveform was basically simulated by the superposition of five major waves, and the least-squares method was applied to each wave to determine the parameters of the equation. Despite the simulation using the single equation assuming that the parameters were constants, the accuracy of the simulated cumulative infection D was as good as 95%CI / D<2.5% after the second wave when D exceeded 10,000. Since the simulation was highly accurate, it was effective in predicting the number of infections in the near future and in considering the cause of changes in the number of infections observed as the detailed structure of the waveform.","Takase, Yoshihiko",,72,24

We find strong partisan differences in evaluations of the government's response to COVID-19 and confidence in its ability to handle the crisis. We also find partisan differences in concern and behavioural responses to the pandemic in both countries. However, the behavioural differences are small, suggesting that while overtly political assessments are strongly partisan this polarization is dampened down when it comes to actual behavioural responses to the pandemic.","Pickup, Mark; Stecula, Dominik; Van Der Linden, Clifton",Can.

Herein, we report the epidemiological and clinical features of 478 patients with confirmed COVID-19 from a multicenter study conducted in four cities in China excluding Wuhan. METHODS: A total of 478 patients transferred by emergency medical services to designated hospitals in four major cities in China (Beijing, Chongqing, Jinan, and Nanning) were enrolled. We compared the characteristics of imported and indigenous cases and calculated the frequencies of fatal, severe, mild, and asymptomatic disease. The results were used to generate a pyramid of COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: The mean age of patients with COVID-19 was 46.9 years and 49.8% were male. The most common symptoms at onset were fever (69.7%), cough (47.5%), fatigue (24.5%), dyspnea (8.4%), and headache (7.9%). Most cases (313, 65.5%) were indigenous, while 165 (34.5%) were imported. Imported cases dominated during the early stages of the pandemic, but decreased from 1 February 2020 as indigenous cases rose sharply. Compared with indigenous cases, imported cases differed significantly in terms of sex (P = 0.002), severity of disease (P = 0.006), occurrence of fever (P < 0.001), family clustering (P < 0.001), history of contact (P < 0.001), and primary outcome (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Within the population studied, imported cases had distinct characteristics from those of indigenous cases, with lower fatality rates and higher discharge rates. New infections shifted from imported cases to local infection gradually, and overall infections have declined to a low level. We suggest that preventing import of cases and controlling spread within local areas can help prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection spread.","Zhang, Jinjun; Yang, Shixiong; Xu, Yi; Qin, Xinyan; Liu, Jialiang; Guo, Jinjun; Tian, Sijia; Wang, Shaoping; Liao, Kai; Zhang, Ying; Ma, Yu; Chen, Yuguo",BMC Infect Dis,72,1

This paper theorises some of the ways in which that crisis can be understood in cultural and discursive terms, as a rupture in normativity, a disturbance in social relationality and as a state of exception. Drawing on Judith Butler's theories of performativity, the paper investigates how such a cultural rupture can be understood to affect performative subjectivity, identity and selfhood, whereby a breach in normative everydayness prompts the re-constitution of subjectivity itself. The paper explores how the reconfiguration of identity is experienced as corporeal and as a site of anxiety and lost dignity. The final section of the paper draws some initial conclusions about the potency of cultural and identity transformation for new ethics of non-violence, arguing that the obligation to resist norms of mobility and contact is an ethical obligation of necessary cohabitation.","Cover, Rob",Social Sciences &amp; Humanities Open,72,16

To date, only a single case of COVID-19 disease associated with a leukoerythroblastic reaction has been reported worldwide in adult patients. Methodology: In the following manuscript we describe the presence of leukoerythroblastosis in a male hospitalized for COVID-19, in which multiple causes were ruled out. Results: The patient had resolution of the leukoerythroblatosis as his respiratory symptoms resolved. Conclusion: The COVID-19 disease could be a new known cause of a leukoerythroblastic reaction, although we believe that a greater number of reported cases is necessary to affirm that the association was not random.","Milanesio, Martin; Suasnabar, David Francisco; Giaj-Merlera, Alejandro; Cebreros, Rocío Gabriela; Marucco, Federico Ariel",Rev Fac Cien Med Univ Nac Cordoba,72,11

To explore vaccine acceptance decisions, we conducted a national survey of 1,000 people from all US states in August of 2020 and a replication in December of 2020. Using a 3 × 3 × 3 factorial experimental design, we estimated the impact of three factors: probability of 1) protection against COVID-19, 2) minor side effects, and 3) a serious adverse reactions. The outcome was respondents' reported likelihood of receiving a vaccine for the coronavirus. Probability of vaccine efficacy (50%, 70%, or 90%) had the largest effect among the three factors. The probability of minor side effects (50%, 75%, 90%) including fever and sore arm, did not significantly influence likelihood of receiving the vaccine. The chances of a serious adverse reaction, such as temporary or permanent paralysis, had a small but significant effect. A serious adverse reaction rate of 1/100,000 was more likely to discourage vaccine use in comparison to rates of 1/million or 1/100 million. All interactions between the factors were nonsignificant. A replication following the announcement that vaccines were 95% effective showed small, but significant increases in the likelihood of taking a vaccine.

Consequently, there is a significant amount of diverse user-generated social media content. However, COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we live, study, socialize and recreate and this has affected our well-being and mental health problems. There are growing researches that leverage online social media analysis to detect and assess user's mental status. In this paper, we survey the literature of social media analysis for mental disorders detection, with a special focus on the studies conducted in the context of COVID-19 during 2020-2021. Firstly, we classify the surveyed studies in terms of feature extraction types, varying from language usage patterns to aesthetic preferences and online behaviors. Secondly, we explore detection methods used for mental disorders detection including machine learning and deep learning detection methods. Finally, we discuss the challenges of mental disorder detection using social media data, including the privacy and ethical concerns, as well as the technical challenges of scaling and deploying such systems at large scales, and discuss the learnt lessons over the last few years.","Dhelim, Sahraoui; Chen, Liming Luke; Ning, Huansheng; Das, Sajal K; Nugent, Chris; Burns, Devin; Leavey, Gerard; Pesch, Dirk; Bantry-White, Eleanor",,72,1

To enhance the prediction capabilities of the models, properties of the unknown uncertainties in the pandemic disease, which can be utterly random, or function of the system dynamics, or it can be correlated with an unknown function, should be determined. The known structures and amount of the uncertainties can also help the state authorities to improve the policies based on the recognized source of the uncertainties. For instance, the uncertainties correlated with an unknown function imply existence of an undetected factor in the casualties. In this paper, we extend the SpID-N (Suspicious-Infected-Death with non-pharmacological policies) model as in the form of MIMO (Multi-Input-Multi-Output) structure by adding the multi-dimensional unknown uncertainties. The results confirm that the infected and death sub-models mostly have random uncertainties (due undetected casualties) whereas the suspicious sub-model has uncertainties correlated with the internal dynamics (governmental policy of increasing the number of the daily tests) for Turkey. However, since the developed MIMO model parameters are learned from the data (daily reported casualties), it can be easily adapted for other countries. Obtained model with the corresponding uncertainties predicts a distinctive second peak where the number of deaths, infected and suspicious casualties disappear in 240, 290, and more than 300 days, respectively, for Turkey.","Tutsoy, Onder; Balikci, Kemal; Ozdil, Naime Filiz",Digit Signal Process,72,9

We propose a data-driven approach for automatic prediction of deterioration risk using a deep neural network that learns from chest X-ray images and a gradient boosting model that learns from routine clinical variables. Our AI prognosis system, trained using data from 3661 patients, achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.786 (95% CI: 0.745-0.830) when predicting deterioration within 96 hours. The deep neural network extracts informative areas of chest X-ray images to assist clinicians in interpreting the predictions and performs comparably to two radiologists in a reader study. In order to verify performance in a real clinical setting, we silently deployed a preliminary version of the deep neural network at New York University Langone Health during the first wave of the pandemic, which produced accurate predictions in real-time. In summary, our findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed system for assisting front-line physicians in the triage of COVID-19 patients.","Shamout, F.

The accuracy of diagnosing critical findings on X-rays by senior medical students is not well assessed. In this study, we aim to assess the knowledge and accuracy of undergraduate final-year medical students in diagnosing life-threatening emergency conditions on chest x-ray. METHOD: This is a cross-sectional nationwide survey across all medical schools in Jordan. Through an electronic questionnaire, participants were sequentially shown a total of six abnormal X-rays and one normal. For each X-ray, participants were asked to choose the most likely diagnosis, and to grade the degree of self-confidence regarding the accuracy of their answer in a score from 0 (not confident) to 10 (very confident). RESULTS: We included a total of 530 participants. All participants answered at least six out of seven questions correctly, out of them, 139 (26.2%) participants answered all questions correctly. Pneumoperitoneum was the highest correct answer (93.8%), whereas flail chest was the least correctly answered case with only 310 (58.5%) correct answers. Regarding self-confidence for each question, 338 participants (63.8%) reported very high overall self-confidence level. Answers related to tension pneumothorax had the highest confidence level. CONCLUSION: Senior Jordanian medical students showed good knowledge with high confidence levels in diagnosing life-threatening conditions on chest x-rays, supporting their incorporation in the emergency department during pandemics and confirming the reliability of information they can extract.","Samara, Osama; AlRyalat, Saif Aldeen; Malkawi, Lna; Ali, Mo039; Bani, ath; Kilani, Areej; Alkhalaileh, Zain; Alkhatib, Lean; Hamad, Ibrahim; Alawneh, Yazan; Al-Ryalat, Nosaiba; Ryalat, Soukaina",Emerg. radiol,72,1

A particular type of Counterfeit coin puzzle is known in the literature as the""Beam balance puzzle"". An abstract solution to it is provided by Iwama et.al as a modification of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, making use of quantum parallelism and entanglement. Moreover, during this pandemic, group testing has proved to be an efficient algorithm to save time and cost of testing specimens for the presence of infection. In this article, we propose a""Binary Spring Balance""(BSB) puzzle, to facilitate a unified picture of the counterfeit coin problem and the testing for infection problem, as both aim to reduce the number of queries. We then showcase two solutions to the BSB problem, one using bits and other using classical-qubits ('cebits"") for querying. Both solutions are demonstrated using circuits. In this pursuit, we develop a modified optical implementation of Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm using only polarizers (no need of beam splitters), which has surprisingly not yet been proposed earlier. Under the pretext of this demonstration we question why we have not yet developed testing mechanisms inspired by Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm for the pandemic, as they solve the problem in single query, they have no issues related to prevalence of infection in the population, nor are they plagued by the issue of dilution of samples due to pooling. The modified implementation of Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm using polarizers can also be a cost-effective demonstration in an undergraduate lab.","Waghela, Chetan",,72,24

To address this, we conduct a retrospective study, which involved patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection in Hefei, China and being discharged between January 20 2020 and March 16 2020. Demographic information, clinical treatment, and laboratory data for the participants were extracted from medical records. A prolonged LOS was defined as equal to or greater than the median length of hospitable stay. The median LOS for the 75 patients was 17 days (IQR 13-22). We used univariable and multivariable logistic regressions to explore the risk factors associated with a prolonged hospital LOS. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. The median age of the 75 patients was 47 years. Approximately 75% of the patients had mild or general disease. The univariate logistic regression model showed that female sex and having a fever on admission were significantly associated with longer duration of hospitalization. The multivariate logistic regression model enhances these associations. Odds of a prolonged LOS were associated with male sex (aOR 0.19, 95% CI 0.05-0.63, p = 0.01), having fever on admission (aOR 8.27, 95% CI 1.47-72.16, p = 0.028) and pre-existing chronic kidney or liver disease (aOR 13.73 95% CI 1.95-145.4, p = 0.015) as well as each 1-unit increase in creatinine level (aOR 0.94, 95% CI 0.9-0.98, p = 0.007). We also found that a prolonged LOS was associated with increased creatinine levels in patients with chronic kidney or liver disease (p < 0.001). In conclusion, female sex, fever, chronic kidney or liver disease before admission and increasing creatinine levels were associated with prolonged LOS in patients with COVID-19.","Guo, Anping; Lu, Jin; Tan, Haizhu; Kuang, Zejian; Luo, Ying; Yang, Tian; Xu, Junlan; Yu, Jishuang; Wen, Canhong; Shen, Aizong",Sci Rep,72,1

On March 16 (week 12) Austriangovernment imposed restrictions and subsequently the Austrian Medical Association has recommended to minimizescreening examinations in compliance with government restrictions. Aim Aim was to evaluate the impact of this recommendation on the number of weekly performed colonoscopies, detection of non-advanced adenomas, advanced adenomas (AA) and colorectal cancer (CRC) and to calculate how many undetectedadenomas could develop into CRC. Methods We analyzed number of colonoscopies and pathological findings within a quality assured national colorectal cancerscreening program before the COVID-19 pandemic (January 1 2019 - July 5 2019, Period 1) and compared those ratesto months with limited access to colonoscopy (January 1 2020 and July 5 2020, Period 2) with a two-tailed T-test, aWilcoxon-rank-test and a chi-square test. Results 23.700 colonoscopies were performed in Period 1, and 15.569 in Period 2. The mean rate of colonoscopies perweek in Period 1 was significantly higher than in Period 2 (877,78 [SD=190,44] versus 576,63 [SD=350,58], p = 0,003).4.655 non-advanced adenomas were detected in Period 1 versus 3.221 in Period 2 (p = 0,012).

We aimed to determine if poorer outcomes were specifically related to chronic immunosuppression or underlying comorbidities. We used a 1:1 propensity score-matching method to compare survival and severe disease-free survival (defined as death and/or need for intensive care unit (ICU)) incidence in hospitalized KTRs and non-transplant control patients between 26 February and 22 May 2020. Patients were matched for risk factors of severe COVID-19: age, sex, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, preexisting cardiopathy, chronic lung disease and basal renal function. We included 100 KTRs (median age [interquartile range (IQR)]) 64.7 years (55.3-73.1) in 3 French transplant centers. After a median follow-up of 13 days (7-30), transfer to ICU was required for 34 patients (34%) and death occurred in 26 patients (26%). Overall, 43 patients (43%) developed a severe disease during a median follow-up of 8.5 days (2-14). Propensity score matching to a large French cohort of 2017 patients hospitalized in 24 centers, revealed that survival was similar between KTRs and matched non-transplant patients with respective 30-days survival of 62.9% and 71% (p=0.38) and severe disease-free 30-days survival of 50.6% and 47.5% (p=0.91).

It is important to be aware of the laws that regulate the management, distribution, and control of medical devices. Article 82 of the Spanish Law 29/2006 on Guarantees and Rational Use of Medicines and Medical Devices establishes that it is the responsibility of Hospital Pharmacy Services ""to participate in and coordinate the purchase of medicines and medical devices in the hospital to ensure an efficient acquisition and rational use of medical devices"". For this reason, working groups of the Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy and other scientific societies have issued technical guidelines and consensus statements to provide technical support and updated information on the use of masks, individual protection equipments and other medical devices. In addition, the shortage of medical devices caused by the high demand has resulted in the uncontrolled production and distribution of medical devices. This phenomenon, added to the fraudulent selling of medical devices, highlights the need for a closer surveillance of the market to guarantee the efficacy and safety of available medical devices. A rational use of medical devices is necessary to ensure the availability and safety of these products, which requires the involvement of different stakeholders, including hospital pharmacists. Thus, it is essential that hospital pharmacists receive specific training in technical aspects concerning the possession and use of medical devices. This will help guarantee an effective and safe use of medical products. The acquisition and use of medical devices requires a keen understanding of the technical and legal aspects concerning these products, which makes hospital pharmacists essential for the integral management of medical devices.","Climent-Ballester, Seira; Selva-Otaolaurruchi, Juan",Farm Hosp,72,26

In this paper, bimetallic sulfide coupled with CNTs ((Co, Mg)S2@CNTs) hybrid catalyst is developed via a proposed vulcanization process. The (Co, Mg)S2@CNTs) with controllable Mg substitution has a tailored crystal structure (amorphous and crystalline), which catalyzes oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/ OER), respectively. The active sites of CoS2@CNTs are activated by doping Mg ions, which accelerates the kinetics of the oxygen adsorption for ORR and oxygen desorption for OER. Meanwhile, the hybrid catalyst exhibits a unique hierarchal morphology and ""catalytic buffer"", which further accelerate the mass transfer of catalytic processes. In addition, the outer wall of CNTs as substrate effectively avoids the agglomeration of (Co, Mg)S2 particles by reasonably providing adsorption sites. The inter and outer walls of CNTs forms a high-speed conduction pathway, quickly transferring the electrons produced by oxygen catalytic reactions. As a result, the (Co, Mg)S2@CNTs exhibits an ORR performance comparable with commercial catalyst Pt/C-RuO2 and remarkable OER performance (Ej=10=1.59V). The high power density of 268 mW cm-2 and long-term charge/discharge-stability of the zinc-air battery proves the feasibility of (Co, Mg)S2@CNTs application in high power devices.","Guo, Jianing; Xu, Nengneng; Wang, Yongxia; Wang, Xu; Huang, Haitao; Qiao, Jinli",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),72,30

The analysis uses pre-pandemic, in-person household survey data and a post-pandemic phone survey. Two-thirds of the respondents reported that their incomes had fallen after the pandemic began, and almost half reported that their ability to satisfy their food needs had worsened. Employing a household fixed effects difference-in-difference approach, the study finds that household food insecurity increased by 11.7 percentage points and the size of the food gap by 0.47 months in the aftermath of the onset of the pandemic. Participation in the Productive Safety Net Program offsets virtually all of this adverse change-the likelihood of becoming food insecure increased by only 2.4 percentage points for Productive Safety Net Program households and the duration of the food gap increased by only 0.13 month. The protective role of the program is greater for poorer households and those living in remote areas. The results are robust to various definitions of program participation, different estimators, and different ways of accounting for the non-randomness of mobile phone ownership. Productive Safety Net Program participants were less likely to reduce expenditures on health and education by 7.7 percentage points and less likely to reduce expenditures on agricultural inputs by 13 percentage points. By contrast, mothers' and children's diets changed little, despite some changes in the composition of diets, with consumption of animal source foods declining significantly.","Abay, K.

This problem is in bandit feedback, in the sense that at each time only the cost function value at the committed point is revealed to each node. Then, nodes update their decisions by exchanging information with their neighbors only. To deal with Lipschitz continuous and strongly convex cost functions, a distributed online convex optimization algorithm that achieves sublinear individual regret for every node is developed. The algorithm is built on the algorithm called the push-sum scheme that releases the request of doubly stochastic weight matrices, and the one-point gradient estimator that requires the function value at only one point at every iteration, instead of the gradient information of loss function. The expected regret of our proposed algorithm scales as O ( T2/3 ln2/3(T) ), and T is the number of iterations. To validate the performance of the algorithm developed in this article, we give a simulation of a common numerical example.","Wang, Cong; Xu, Shengyuan; Yuan, Deming; Zhang, Baoyong; Zhang, Zhengqiang",IEEE trans. cybern.

It is largely unknown how the human immune system responds to this infection. A better understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 will be important to develop therapeutics against COVID-19. Here, we have used transcriptomic profile of human alveolar adenocarcinoma cells (A549) infected with SARS-CoV-2 and employed a network biology approach to generate human-virus interactome. Network topological analysis discovers 15 SARS-CoV-2 targets, which belongs to a subset of interferon (IFN) stimulated genes (ISGs). These ISGs (IFIT1, IFITM1, IRF7, ISG15, MX1, and OAS2) can be considered as potential candidates for drug targets in the treatments of COVID-19. We have identified significant interaction between ISGs and TLR3 agonists, like poly I: C, and imiquimod, and suggests that TLR3 agonists can be considered as a potential drug for drug repurposing in COVID-19.

Understanding these discussions can help institutions, governments, and individuals navigate the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyze discussions on Twitter related to COVID-19 and to investigate the sentiments toward COVID-19. METHODS: This study applied machine learning methods in the field of artificial intelligence to analyze data collected from Twitter. Using tweets originating exclusively in the United States and written in English during the 1-month period from March 20 to April 19, 2020, the study examined COVID-19-related discussions. Social network and sentiment analyses were also conducted to determine the social network of dominant topics and whether the tweets expressed positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. Geographic analysis of the tweets was also conducted. RESULTS: There were a total of 14,180,603 likes, 863,411 replies, 3,087,812 retweets, and 641,381 mentions in tweets during the study timeframe. Out of 902,138 tweets analyzed, sentiment analysis classified 434,254 (48.2%) tweets as having a positive sentiment, 187,042 (20.7%) as neutral, and 280,842 (31.1%) as negative. The study identified 5 dominant themes among COVID-19-related tweets: health care environment, emotional support, business economy, social change, and psychological stress. Alaska, Wyoming, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Florida were the states expressing the most negative sentiment while Vermont, North Dakota, Utah, Colorado, Tennessee, and North Carolina conveyed the most positive sentiment. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified 5 prevalent themes of COVID-19 discussion with sentiments ranging from positive to negative. These themes and sentiments can clarify the public's response to COVID-19 and help officials navigate the pandemic.","Hung, Man; Lauren, Evelyn; Hon, Eric S; Birmingham, Wendy C; Xu, Julie; Su, Sharon; Hon, Shirley D; Park, Jungweon; Dang, Peter; Lipsky, Martin S",J Med Internet Res,72,21

Nowadays, they are a non‐timber forest product and a diverse genetic resource with great ecological, sociocultural, economic, medicinal and biotechnological relevance around the world. Therefore, they have a paramount role to play in meeting the United Nations global sustainable development goals 2030. EMF may promote forest sustainability, biodiversity conservation, mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions through the maintenance of forest masses, human nutrition and health, economic development, conservation of biocultural heritages, women empowerment and hunger mitigation. We provide a worldwide review of the knowledge, biodiversity, novel approaches, future challenges and perspectives in the post‐COVID era of this important genetic resource whose relevance has usually received marginal attention despite its strategic global significance.Ectomycorrhizal fungi play a key role in the structure and functioning of forest ecosystems. They have a paramount importance in nutrient cycling, plant protection against pathogens and abiotic stress, and establishment of underground networks that connect trees and other plants in nature, therefore being the wood wide web, the ‘internet’ of the forests. According to our literature review, globally 970 mycorrhizal fungal species (including both mushrooms and truffles) are edible, and they have enormous relevance either as a source of subsistence in low‐income human groups around the world or as an important economic component whose international commerce is worth billions of American dollars annually. Since edible mycorrhizal fungi (EMF) are a non‐timber forest product, their sustainable use and management is crucial in order to maintain forest stands and to provide well‐being to the human communities surrounding the forested areas where they grow. In different parts of the world, different cultures have developed a traditional knowledge of EMF over millennia. Their knowledge might play an important role in food supply and food security in the future, hence contributing towards the “zero hunger” global goal. The biotechnological development of EMF has also been crucial in the establishment of plantations, or successful reforestation and ecosystem restoration, which contribute to climate change mitigation by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Here, a worldwide review of how EMF might contribute to forest sustainability, food supply, biocultural conservation, and hunger and climate change mitigation is addressed by analysing the similarities, contrasts and challenges in all five continents.

However, in some regions the ampleness of the phenomenon is not quantifiable or comparable due to the lack of an adequate framework and reliable metrics. Our research intends to make a little light by assessing the degree of m-learning adoption in students at a moment when face-to-face education moved suddenly online due to the COVID-19 outbreak's rapid and unpredictable spread. A new model relying on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) was built to investigate and explain relationships between constructs. It reveals the key factors affecting technology adoption by considering hedonic motivation a mediator instead of an exogenous variable as in UTAUT2. Based on an analysis of 311 higher education learners, the way how performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions influence directly or indirectly the behavioral intention is researched. The analysis was conducted employing partial least squares structural equation modeling. The strongest relationship is between hedonic motivation and behavioral intention followed by the one between perceived effectiveness and hedonic motivation. Age, gender, and experience moderate the model's relationships. Research contributes to theory development by successfully adjusting the original UTAUT model. Results indicate that universities may offer learners an enjoyable m-learning experience by activating social support groups and inserting gameplay elements into the learning system.","Sitar-Taut, Dan-Andrei",,72,24

The RdRp associates with additional non-structural proteins (nsps) to form a replication-transcription complex (RTC) that carries out RNA synthesis, capping and proofreading. However, the structure of the RdRp long remained elusive, thus limiting our understanding of coronavirus genome expression and replication. Recently, the cryo-electron microscopy structure of SARS-CoV-1 RdRp was reported. Driven by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, structural data on the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase and associated factors has since emerged at an unprecedented pace, with more than twenty structures released to date.

Recent reports suggest an association with use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a functional receptor for coronaviruses. Higher ACE2 concentrations might lead to increased vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 in patients on RAAS inhibitors. METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured ACE2 concentrations in 1485 men and 537 women with heart failure (index cohort). Results were validated in 1123 men and 575 women (validation cohort).The median age was 69 years for men and 75 years for women. The strongest predictor of elevated concentrations of ACE2 in both cohorts was male sex (estimate = 0.26, P < 0.001; and 0.19, P < 0.001, respectively). In the index cohort, use of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) was not an independent predictor of plasma ACE2. In the validation cohort, ACE inhibitor (estimate = -0.17, P = 0.002) and ARB use (estimate = -0.15, P = 0.03) were independent predictors of lower plasma ACE2, while use of an MRA (estimate = 0.11, P = 0.04) was an independent predictor of higher plasma ACE2 concentrations. CONCLUSION: In two independent cohorts of patients with heart failure, plasma concentrations of ACE2 were higher in men than in women, but use of neither an ACE inhibitor nor an ARB was associated with higher plasma ACE2 concentrations. These data might explain the higher incidence and fatality rate of COVID-19 in men, but do not support previous reports suggesting that ACE inhibitors or ARBs increase the vulnerability for COVID-19 through increased plasma ACE2 concentrations.","Sama, Iziah E; Ravera, Alice; Santema, Bernadet T; van Goor, Harry; Ter Maaten, Jozine M; Cleland, John G F; Rienstra, Michiel; Friedrich, Alex W; Samani, Nilesh J; Ng, Leong L; Dickstein, Kenneth; Lang, Chim C; Filippatos, Gerasimos; Anker, Stefan D; Ponikowski, Piotr; Metra, Marco; van Veldhuisen, Dirk J; Voors, Adriaan A",Eur Heart J,72,1

There is very limited data regarding ASIA syndrome following SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. OBJECTIVES: This work aims to report cases of subacute thyroiditis related to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. METHODS: We describe the clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of three cases of subacute thyroiditis after inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (CoronaVac®). Three female healthcare workers have applied to our clinic with anterior neck pain and fatigue four to seven days after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Two of them were in the breastfeeding period. They were negative for thyroid antibodies, and there was no previous history of thyroid disease or upper respiratory tract infection, or COVID-19. Laboratory test results and imaging findings were consistent with subacute thyroiditis. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can lead to subacute thyroiditis as a phenomenon of ASIA syndrome. Subacute thyroiditis may develop within a few days after the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Being in the postpartum period may be a facilitating factor for the development of ASIA syndrome after the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of subacute thyroiditis as a phenomenon of ASIA syndrome after inactivated COVID-19 vaccination. Clinicians should be aware that subacute thyroiditis may develop as a manifestation of ASIA syndrome after the inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.","Iremli, Burçin Gönül; Sendur, Süleyman Nahit; Ünlütürk, Ugur",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,72,17

While research towards developing universal influenza vaccines is ongoing, the current strategy for vaccine supply in a pandemic relies on seasonal influenza vaccine production to be switched over to pandemic vaccines. Understanding how much vaccine could be produced, in which regions of the world and in what timeframe is critical to informing influenza pandemic preparedness. Through the Global Action Plan for Influenza Vaccines, 2006-2016, WHO promoted an increase in vaccine production capacity and monitors the landscape through periodically surveying influenza vaccine manufacturers. This study compares global capacity for production of influenza vaccines in 2019 with estimates from previous surveys; provides an overview of countries with established production facilities; presents vaccine production by type and manufacturing process; and discusses limitations to these estimates. Results of the current survey show that estimated annual seasonal influenza vaccine production capacity changed little since 2015 increasing from 1.47 billion to 1.48 billion doses with potential maximum annual influenza pandemic vaccine production capacity increasing from 6.37 billion to 8.31 billion doses. However, this figure should be interpreted with caution as it presents a best-case scenario with several assumptions which may impact supply. Further, pandemic vaccines would not be immediately available and could take four to six months for first supplies with several more months needed to reach maximum capacity. A moderate-case scenario is also presented of 4.15 billion doses of pandemic vaccine in 12 months. It is important to note that two doses of pandemic vaccine are likely to be required to elicit an adequate immune response. Continued efforts are needed to ensure the sustainability of this production and to conduct research for vaccines that are faster to produce and more broadly protective taking into account lessons learned from COVID-19 vaccine development.","Sparrow, Erin; Wood, James G; Chadwick, Christopher; Newall, Anthony T; Torvaldsen, Siranda; Moen, Ann; Torelli, Guido",Vaccine,72,1

The global spread has been swift, and many key questions remain. The case-fatality rate for persons cared for in the United States and whether asymptomatic persons transmit the virus are examples of questions that need to be answered to inform public health control measures. There are also unanswered questions specific to pregnant women, such as whether pregnant women are more severely affected and whether intrauterine transmission occurs. Although guidelines for pregnant women from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been rapidly developed based on the best available evidence, additional information is critically needed to inform key decisions, such as whether pregnant health care workers should receive special consideration, whether to temporarily separate infected mothers and their newborns, and whether it is safe for infected women to breastfeed. Some current recommendations are well supported, based largely on what we know from seasonal influenza: patients should avoid contact with ill persons, avoid touching their face, cover coughs and sneezes, wash hands frequently, disinfect contaminated surfaces, and stay home when sick. Prenatal clinics should ensure all pregnant women and their visitors are screened for fever and respiratory symptoms, and symptomatic women should be isolated from well women and required to wear a mask.

However, its impact on PICUs remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate whether telemedicine in the PICU has the potential to improve clinical and non-clinical outcomes. PubMed, Scopus, LILACS, and CINAHL electronic databases were searched to identify studies that assessed the impact of telemedicine on clinical outcomes, with no publication date restrictions. The reference lists of the selected articles were hand-searched for additional studies that had not been identified by the initial electronic search. Studies were included if they had a cohort design, used telemedicine, were conducted in PICUs or specialized PICUs, and were published in Portuguese, English, or Spanish. Two groups of reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion. The same group of reviewers independently assessed the full-text articles for eligibility and extracted the following information: telecommunication method, intervention characteristics, patient characteristics, sample size, and main results. Studies were meta-analyzed using a random-effects model to estimate the pooled prevalence of PICU mortality and length of PICU stay. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Of 2703 studies initially identified, 2226 had their titles and abstracts screened. Of these, 53 were selected for full-text reading, of which 10 were included and analyzed. The main results of interest were length of PICU stay, number of deaths or mortality rate, and satisfaction of health professionals and family members. The results of meta-analysis show that the mortality rate reduced by 34% with an increase of the length of PICU stay in the PICUs with the use of telemedicine. Family members and health professionals were satisfied with the use of telemedicine. Telemedicine has the potential to improve PICU outcomes, such as mortality rate and family and staff satisfaction. However, it extended length of PICU stay in the studies included in this systematic review.","Vinadé Chagas, Maria Eulália; Rodrigues Moleda Constant, Hilda Maria; Cristina Jacovas, Vanessa; Castro da Rocha, Jacqueline; Galves Crivella Steimetz, Carina; Cotta Matte, Maria Cristina; de Campos Moreira, Taís; Cezar Cabral, Felipe",PLoS One,72,26

The most widely used tests are rapid lateral flow assays that generate results in approximately 15 minutes for diagnosis at the point-of-care. Higher throughput, laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 antigen (Ag) assays have also been developed. The overall accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests, however, is not well defined. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) convened an expert panel to perform a systematic review of the literature and develop best practice guidance related to SARS-CoV-2 Ag testing. This guideline is the third in a series of rapid, frequently updated COVID-19 diagnostic guidelines developed by IDSA. OBJECTIVE: IDSA's goal was to develop evidence-based recommendations or suggestions that assist clinicians, clinical laboratories, patients, public health authorities, administrators and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests in both medical and non-medical settings. METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists and experts in systematic literature review identified and prioritized clinical questions related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. RESULTS: The panel agreed on five diagnostic recommendations. These recommendations address antigen testing in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals as well as assess single versus repeat testing strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Data on the clinical performance of U.S. Food and Drug Administration SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests with Emergency Use Authorization is mostly limited to single, one-time testing versus standard nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) as the reference standard. Rapid Ag tests have high specificity and low to modest sensitivity compared to reference NAAT methods. Antigen test sensitivity is heavily dependent on viral load, with differences observed between symptomatic compared to asymptomatic individuals and the time of testing post onset of symptoms. Based on these observations, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT remain the diagnostic methods of choice for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, when molecular testing is not readily available or is logistically infeasible, Ag testing can help identify some individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The overall quality of available evidence supporting use of Ag testing was graded as very low to moderate.","Hanson, Kimberly E; Altayar, Osama; Caliendo, Angela M; Arias, Cesar A; Englund, Janet A; Hayden, Mary K; Lee, Mark J; Loeb, Mark; Patel, Robin; El Alayli, Abdallah; Sultan, Shahnaz; Falck-Ytter, Yngve; Lavergne, Valery; Mansour, Razan; Morgan, Rebecca L; Murad, M Hassan; Patel, Payal; Bhimraj, Adarsh; Mustafa, Reem A",Clin. infect. dis,72,20

DESIGN: This is a retrospective review. SETTING: The setting is three freestanding inpatient rehabilitation hospitals operating as one system. PARTICIPANTS: The participants are consecutive patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation hospital without a diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis or screening duplex ultrasound prior to transfer. INTERVENTIONS: A duplex ultrasound of lower limbs was performed upon admission to inpatient rehabilitation hospital. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was the percentage of admission patients with a lower limb deep venous thrombosis. Secondary factors included potential risk factors for a positive screen for deep venous thrombosis. RESULTS: A lower limb deep venous thrombosis was diagnosed in 22% (25/113) of the patients tested, with eight patients (7.1%) having a proximal deep venous thrombosis. Risk factors for screening positive for a deep venous thrombosis included being male, younger, and having been on a ventilator during the acute illness. CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of deep venous thrombosis observed in these patients suggests that the risk of venous thromboembolic disorders after severe COVID-19 illness is considerable and surveillance measures of such patients should be undertaken.","Kirshblum, Steven C; DeLauter, Gabrielle; Eren, Fatma; Pomeranz, Bruce; DeLuca, Robert; Hammerman, Samuel; Gans, Bruce M",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,72,16

The selected traits and their parameterization were based on the results of a long-term experiment in which temperate grasslands were managed for 12 years with three levels of herbage use: high, medium and low. The integration of functional attributes of the community species within the models parameters can be seen as a new step in the study of the grassland ecosystem. With this tool, it is possible to decrease the number of interconnections in the system and consequently decrease the complexity. In this work a, functional definition of three different grassland communities was introduced into the sub-vegetation model. This was done by interchanging the models parameters with the functional attributes of the communities. From the conceptual point of view, the sub-vegetation model works adequately and it seems suitable to simulate the dynamic of grassland vegetation described by functional traits. The model fits experimental data well for high levels of utilization, but was poorly adjusted at medium and low levels of herbage use.

Cardiometabolic disorders are associated with poor clinical outcomes in persons with COVID-19. Healthcare challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic are linked to resource constraints including shortage of Personal Protective Equipment's (PPE), laboratory tests and medication. In this context, a group of clinical experts discussed the endocrine and cardiology vigilance required in times of COVID-19. Further, the group proposed certain resource husbandry recommendations to be followed during the pandemic to overcome the constraints. METHOD: The clinical experts discussed and provided their inputs virtually. The expert panel included clinical experts comprising endocrinologists, Consultant Physicians and cardiologists from India. The panel thoroughly reviewed existing literature on the subject and proposed expert opinion. RESULTS: The expert panel put forward clinical practice-based opinion for the management of cardiometabolic conditions including diabetes mellitus and hypertension. As these conditions are associated with poor clinical outcomes, the expert panel recommends that these persons be extra-cautious and take necessary precautions during the ongoing pandemic. Further, experts also provided appropriate, affordable, available and accessible solution to the resource constraint situations in times of COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The clinical expert opinion put forward in this article will serve as a reference for clinicians treating diabetes and cardiovascular disease during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Das, Ashok Kumar; Kalra, Sanjay; B, Krishnakumar; Sharma, Kamal; John, Mathew; Nair, Tiny; Shaikh, Shehla; Khandelwal, Deepak; Priya, Gagan; Dutta, Deep; Gangadhar, Prathosh; Dhingra, Atul; Tiwaskar, Mangesh; Shukla, Rishi; Das, Sambit; Baruah, Manash Pratim; Gangopadhyay, Kalyan Kumar; Ramakrishnan, Santosh; Deshmukh, Vaishali; Dasgupta, Arundhati; Kumar, GVijaya; Pandey, Neelam; Joshi, Amya; Surana, Vineet Kumar; Punyani, Hitesh; Shah, Parag; Rattan, Aditya; Chandrasekaran, Sruti; Asirwatham, Arthur",Diabetes Metab Syndr,72,21

In response to the pandemic, the federal government modified guidelines to allow opioid treatment programs (OTPs) greater flexibility in the provision of medication for opioid use disorder. We conducted a telephone survey of 31.10% of OTPs in the contiguous United States between June and July 2020. We contacted a random sample of 477 facilities and obtained responses from 373. The survey asked questions about new patient intake, screening for COVID-19, social distancing measures, as well as new treatments offered due to changes in federal government policy. We calculated percentages of positive and nonpositive responses to each survey question. We estimated logistic regressions of facility-, county- and state-level predictors of each treatment approach. Most OTPs are taking new patients (91%). Roughly 83% of them screen for COVID-19 symptoms for in-person visits and about 92% use social distancing measures. More than half of OTPs provide curbside treatment (83%) or telehealth (81%). Less than a quarter of OTPs offer medication drop off (21%) or pick up by a trusted person (32%) when patients need to quarantine due to COVID-19. Results from multivariable logistic regressions show that OTPs in states that had a shelter-in-place policy are more likely to socially distance for in-person visits than those in states without such a policy.","Cantor, Jonathan; Laurito, Agustina",J Subst Abuse Treat,72,1

The low level of knowledge and negative attitudes toward COVID-19 among HCWs can lead to inappropriate responding, wrong diagnoses, and poor practices for prevention. This research aims to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding COVID-19 prevention and factors influencing the practices among HCWs in Daklak province, Vietnam. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 963 HCWs working at district health centers and commune health stations through an online survey. Results: Overall, HCWs have good knowledge (91.3%), a positive attitude (71.5%), and appropriate practice (83.1%) regarding COVID-19 prevention. There was 89.6% of HCWs facing difficulties in practicing preventive measures such as felt difficult to change their habits (56.4%), insufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) (40.0%), and inconvenience to practice preventive measures (14.4%). The factors associated with implementing good practices are age group, residence, and knowledge about COVID-19. Recommendation: The Daklak Department of Health should provide additional training programs and guidelines about COVID-19 prevention and PPE for HCWs. More studies on risk and protective factors, and assessment about KAP regarding COVID-19 prevention at the post of the pandemic are needed.","Tien, Truong Quang Tuyet-Hanh Tran Thi Linh Tran Nu Quy Hai Phuc Hoang Van Nhu Ha",Health Services Insights,72,29

Typically, they do not consider in what aspects two documents are similar. This limits the granularity of applications like recommender systems that rely on document similarity. In this paper, we extend similarity with aspect information by performing a pairwise document classification task. We evaluate our aspect-based document similarity for research papers. Paper citations indicate the aspect-based similarity, i.e., the section title in which a citation occurs acts as a label for the pair of citing and cited paper. We apply a series of Transformer models such as RoBERTa, ELECTRA, XLNet, and BERT variations and compare them to an LSTM baseline. We perform our experiments on two newly constructed datasets of 172,073 research paper pairs from the ACL Anthology and CORD-19 corpus. Our results show SciBERT as the best performing system. A qualitative examination validates our quantitative results. Our findings motivate future research of aspect-based document similarity and the development of a recommender system based on the evaluated techniques.

Clinically, albuterol is administered using an infusion pump or unit doses. However, little evidence is available to compare the two administration strategies. METHODS: A toddler manikin (15 kg) with appropriate anatomic airway was connected with collecting filter to a simulator of distressed breathing. HFNC device with mesh nebulizer placed at the inlet of a humidifier at 37°C, with the gas flow set at 25 and 3.75 L/min. Five milligrams of albuterol was delivered in all experiments. With infusion pump administration, albuterol concentrations of 5 and 1 mg/mL were delivered at 4 and 20 mL/hr for 15 minutes. With unit dose administration, 1 mL (5 mg/mL) and 2 mL (2.5 mg/mL) of albuterol were nebulized. Additional tests with mouth open and nebulizers via mask were using 5 mg/1 mL for mesh nebulizer and 5 mg/3 mL for jet nebulizer (n = 3). The drug was eluted from the filter and assayed with UV spectrophotometry (276 nm). RESULTS: The inhaled dose was higher with unit dose than infusion pump administration with gas flows of 25 L/min (2.66 ± 0.38 vs 1.16 ± 0.28%; P = .004) and 3.75 L/min (10.51 ± 1.29 vs 8.58 ± 0.68%; P = .025). During unit dose administration, compared with closed-mouth breathing, open-mouth breathing generated a higher inhaled dose at 3.75 L/min and lower inhaled dose at 25 L/min. Compared to the nebulizers via mask with both open and closed-mouth breathing, nebulization via HFNC at 3.75 L/min generated greater inhaled dose, while HFNC at 25 L/min generated lower inhaled dose. CONCLUSIONS: During transnasal aerosol delivery, the inhaled dose was higher with medication administrated using unit dose than using an infusion pump.","Li, Jie; Wei, Wu; Fink, James B",Pediatr Pulmonol,72,20

This paper examines the effects of these short-selling bans on market quality during the recent pandemic caused by the spread of COVID-19. Our results suggest that during the crisis, banned stocks had higher information asymmetry, lower liquidity, and lower abnormal returns compared with nonbanned stocks. These findings confirm prior theoretical arguments and empirical evidence in other settings that short-selling bans are not effective in stabilizing financial markets during periods of heightened uncertainty.

The role of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) became of central importance. At the Robert Koch Institute, a multilayer strategy consisting of population-based and individual preventive measures to control the pandemic was developed, which built upon existing influenza pandemic plans as well as generic plans. This paper explains the recommended NPIs and illustrates the pharmaceutical approaches developed in parallel.Among others, general contact bans, providing material for infection prevention and control, ban of events, closing educational institutions, and restricting travel are counted among population-based measures. Additional individual preventive measures are necessary, e.g., keeping a minimum distance, reducing contacts, and wearing a mouth-nose covering as well as quarantine and isolation. Measures within the health system are based on recommendations of the Commission on Hospital Hygiene and Infection Protection (Kommission für Krankenhaushygiene und Infektionsprävention (KRINKO)) and specified and implemented by professional societies.

With limited existing research, the aim of this study was to explore the psychological effects of COVID-19 public health measures on older adults in Uganda and their coping mechanisms.Methods: Thirty semi-structured interviews were conducted with older Ugandans (aged 60+) in June 2020. Participants were asked about their experiences of public health measures, and their effects on the lives of older adults compared to pre-pandemic.Results: Three themes were identified: Impact on emotional well-being; Implications on physical well-being; and Coping mechanisms. Older adults experienced both psychological and physical effects, including upset, fear, and frustration about restrictions and the virus, as well as early signs of increased frailty, thus causing concerns for the long-term emotional and physical health of older Ugandans.Conclusions: Public health measures need to be considerate of the potential long-term implications on the well-being of older adults in low-, middle-, and high-income countries, and ensure the possibility for continued physical exercise and social connection. This can be particularly challenging for people from more disadvantaged backgrounds who may not be able to afford a smartphone or laptop, with older adults further requiring support in using digital technologies.Clinical Implications: Older adults need to receive adequate psychological support to cope with the mental health impacts of the pandemic.","Giebel, Clarissa; Ivan, Bwire; Ddumba, Isaac",Clin Gerontol,72,16

Our objective was to analyze immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in older adults across frailty and disability profiles. DESIGN: Multicenter longitudinal cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 134 residents aged &#8805;65 years with different frailty and disability profiles in five long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in Albacete, Spain. INTERVENTION AND MEASUREMENTS: Residents were administered two vaccine doses as per the label, and antibody levels were determined 21.9 days (SD 9.3) after both the first and second dose. Functional variables were assessed using activities of daily living (Barthel Index), and frailty status was determined with the FRAIL instrument. Cognitive status and comorbidity were also evaluated. RESULTS: Mean age was 82.9 years (range 65-99), and 71.6% were female. The mean antibody titers in residents with and without previous COVID-19 infection were 49,878 AU/ml and 15,274 AU/ml, respectively (mean difference 34,604; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 27,699-41,509). No severe adverse reactions were observed, after either vaccine dose. Those with prevaccination COVID-19 had an increased antibody level after the vaccine (B = 31,337; 95% CI: 22,725-39,950; p < 0.001). Frailty, disability, older age, sex, cognitive impairment, or comorbidities were not associated with different antibody titers. CONCLUSIONS: The BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in older adults is safe and produces immunogenicity, independently of the frailty and disability profiles. Older adults in LTCFs should receive a COVID-19 vaccine.","Salmerón Ríos, Sergio; Mas Romero, Marta; Cortés Zamora, Elisa Belén; Tabernero Sahuquillo, María Teresa; Romero Rizos, Luis; Sánchez-Jurado, Pedro Manuel; Sánchez-Nievas, Ginés; Señalada, José Joaquín Blas; García Nogueras, Inmaculada; Estrella Cazalla, Juan de Dios; Andrés-Pretel, Fernando; Murillo Romero, Antonio; Lauschke, Volker Martin; Stebbing, Justin; Abizanda, Pedro",J. am. geriatr. soc,72,33

These concerns are especially exacerbated in many low- and middle-income countries, where untreated sewage is frequently discharged to surface waters. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in river water (RW) and raw wastewater (WW) samples. However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 viability in these environmental matrices. Determining the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in water under different environmental conditions is of great importance for basic assumptions in quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA). In this study, the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed using plaque assays following spiking of RW and WW samples with infectious SARS-CoV-2 that was previously isolated from a COVID-19 patient. These assays were carried out on autoclaved RW and WW samples, filtered (0.22 µm) and unfiltered, at 4 °C and 24 °C. Linear and nonlinear regression models were adjusted to the data. The Weibull regression model achieved the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and was hence chosen to estimate T90 and T99 (time required for 1 log and 2 log reductions, respectively). SARS-CoV-2 remained viable longer in filtered compared with unfiltered samples. RW and WW showed T90 values of 1.9 and 1.2 day and T99 values of 6.4 and 4.0 days, respectively. When samples were filtered through 0.22 µm pore size membranes, T90 values increased to 3.3 and 1.5 days, and T99 increased to 8.5 and 4.5 days, for RW and WW samples, respectively. Remarkable increases in SARS-CoV-2 persistence were observed in assays at 4 °C, which showed T90 values of 7.7 and 5.5 days, and T99 values of 18.7 and 17.5 days for RW and WW, respectively. These results highlight the variability of SARS-CoV-2 persistence in water and wastewater matrices and can be highly relevant to efforts aimed at quantifying water-related risks, which could be valuable for understanding and controlling the pandemic.","de Oliveira, Leonardo Camilo; Torres-Franco, Andrés Felipe; Lopes, Bruna Coelho; Santos, Beatriz Senra Álvares da Silva; Costa, Erica Azevedo; Costa, Michelle S; Reis, Marcus Tulius P; Melo, Marília C; Polizzi, Rodrigo Bicalho; Teixeira, Mauro Martins; Mota, César Rossas",Water Res,72,30

With the recent technological advances, natural product-based drug discovery is now reaching a new era. Natural products have also shown promise in epigenetic drug discovery, some of them have advanced into clinical trials or are presently being used in clinic. The histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), an important class of histone demethylases, has fundamental roles in the development of various pathological conditions. Targeting LSD1 has been recognized as a promising therapeutic option for cancer treatment. Notably, some natural products with different chemotypes including protoberberine alkaloids, flavones, polyphenols, and cyclic peptides have shown effectiveness against LSD1. These natural products provide novel scaffolds for developing new LSD1 inhibitors. In this review, we mainly discuss the identification of natural LSD1 inhibitors, analysis of the co-crystal structures of LSD1/natural product complex, antitumor activity and their modes of action. We also briefly discuss the challenges faced in this field. We believe this review will provide a landscape of natural LSD1 inhibitors.","Fang, Yuan; Yang, Chao; Yu, Zhiqiang; Li, Xiaochuan; Mu, Qingchun; Liao, Guochao; Yu, Bin",,72,16

Although a deeper understanding of this relationship is vital, it is also important to inform the general public about the risks and, ideally, offer strategies to mitigate the risks. As ""resolution"" of obesity in the short-term is not feasible, it is indeed possible that smaller weight losses and increase in physical activity can actually reduce the risks. In this context, we propose that a term called ""controlled obesity"" be more often used and studied, in which those who have lost over 10% of their maximal weight and, ideally, are physically active are considered healthier. This context can have much broader usefulness, beyond the pandemics, as evidence points that weight loss over 10% can significant reduce overall health risks, irrespective of final BMI.","Halpern, B; Mancini, M C",J. endocrinol. invest,72,23

Post-mortem studies revealed higher epigenetic age in brains of patients with major depressive disorder, as compared with controls. Since MDD is highly correlated with anxiety, we hypothesized that symptoms of anxiety, as well as lower volume of grey matter (GM) in depression-related cortical regions, will be associated with faster epigenetic clock in a community-based sample of young adults. Participants included 88 young adults (53% men; 23-24 years of age) from the European Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ELSPAC) who participated in its neuroimaging follow-up and provided saliva samples for epigenetic analysis. Epigenetic age was calculated according to Horvath (Horvath, 2013). Women had slower epigenetic clock than men (Cohen's d = 0.48). In women (but not men), slower epigenetic clock was associated with less symptoms of anxiety. In the brain, women (but not men) with slower epigenetic clock had greater GM volume in the cerebral cortex (brain size-corrected; R2 = 0.07). Lobe-specific analyses showed that in women (but not men), slower epigenetic clock was associated with greater GM volume in frontal lobe (R2 = 0.16), and that GM volume in frontal lobe mediated the relationship between the speed of epigenetic clock and anxiety trait (ab = 0.15, SE = 0.15, 95% CI [0.007; 0.369]). These findings were not replicated, however, in a community-based sample of adolescents (n = 129; 49% men; 12-19 years of age), possibly due to the different method of tissue collection (blood vs. saliva) or additional sources of variability in the cohort of adolescents (puberty stages, socioeconomic status, prenatal exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy).","Marecková, Klára; Pacínková, Anna; Klasnja, Anja; Shin, Jean; Andrýsková, Lenka; Stano-Kozubík, Katerina; Pausová, Zdenka; Brázdil, Milan; Paus, Tomás",Neuroimage Clin,72,32

Under these conditions, a new decay channel into bound photon pairs emerges, through which spatial correlations between emitters are established by regular interference as well as interactions between the photons. We derive an effective Markovian theory to model the resulting decay dynamics of an arbitrary distribution of emitters and identify collective effects beyond the usual phenomena of super- and subradiance. Specifically, in the limit of many close-by emitters, we find that the system undergoes a supercorrelated decay process where all the emitters are either in the excited state or in the ground state but not in any of the intermediate states. The predicted effects can be probed in state-of-the-art waveguide QED experiments and provide a striking example of how the dynamics of open quantum systems can be modified by many-body effects in a nonharmonic environment.","Wang, Zhihai; Jaako, Tuomas; Kirton, Peter; Rabl, Peter",Phys Rev Lett,72,1

The frying process of soybean oil (SO) showed three obvious stages-break-in, optimum, and degrading. Further, in order to distinguish the key aroma compounds in each stage, the FFs prepared in SO with total polar compounds (TPC) of 6.5% (FF7), 16.37% (FF16), and 26.5% (FF27), and their corresponding oils (SO7, SO16, SO27) were chosen for sensory-directed analysis. In the break-in stage (6.50-13.50% of TPC), the flavor of the FFs was light and undesirable due to the lower content of (E,E)-2,4-decadienal. Then at the optimum stage (15.43-22.70% of TPC), the FFs obtained a higher sensory score, mainly owing to the increase of (E,E)-2,4-decadienal with a strong, deep-fried odor. However, in the degrading stage (over 22.70% of TPC), high level of four acids (hexanoic, heptanoic, octanoic, and nonanoic acid), benzeneacetaldehyde and trans-4,5-epoxy-(E)-2-decenal resulted in flavor deterioration in FF27.","Xu, Lirong; Mei, Xue; Chang, Jiarui; Wu, Gangcheng; Zhang, Hui; Jin, Qingzhe; Wang, Xingguo",Food Chem,72,26

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed data from 489,769 adults enrolled in the UK Biobank-a population-based cohort study. The exposures of interest are BMI categories and central obesity (e.g., larger waist circumference). Using genome-wide genotyping data, we also computed polygenic risk scores (PRSs) that represent an individual's overall genetic risk for each obesity trait. The outcome was severe COVID-19, defined by hospitalization for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: Of 489,769 individuals, 33% were normal weight (BMI, 18.5-24.9â¯kg/m2), 43% overweight (25.0-29.9â¯kg/m2), and 24% obese (&#8805;30.0â¯kg/m2). The UK Biobank identified 641 patients with severe COVID-19. Compared to adults with normal weight, those with a higher BMI had a dose-response increases in the risk of severe COVID-19, with the following adjusted ORs: for 25.0-29.9â¯kg/m2, 1.40 (95%CI 1.14-1.73; Pâ¯=â¯0.002); for 30.0-34.9â¯kg/m2, 1.73 (95%CI 1.36-2.20; Pâ¯<â¯0.001); for 35.0-39.9â¯kg/m2, 2.82 (95%CI 2.08-3.83; Pâ¯<â¯0.001); and for &#8805;40.0â¯kg/m2, 3.30 (95%CI 2.17-5.03; Pâ¯<â¯0.001). Likewise, central obesity was associated with significantly higher risk of severe COVID-19 (Pâ¯<â¯0.001). Furthermore, larger PRS for BMI was associated with higher risk of outcome (adjusted OR per BMI PRS Z-score 1.14, 95%CI 1.05-1.24; Pâ¯=â¯0.004).

This study has quantified the efficiency, safety and efficacy of UAV-based spraying of aqueous ozone. Optimised UAV flight characteristics of 4.7 km/h at 1.7 m elevation spraying 2.4 L/min were able to provide >97% and >92% coverage of a 1 m and 2 m wide swath respectively. During spraying operations using 1 mg/L aqueous ozone, atmospheric concentrations of ozone remained within background levels (<0.04 ppm). Highly efficient inactivation of two different isolates of SARS-CoV-2 virus was achieved at aqueous ozone concentrations of 0.75 mg/L after an incubation period of only 5 min, with 0.375 mg/L achieving 82-91.5% inactivation in this time. Exposure of diamondback moth larvae and parasitic wasps to 1 mg/L aqueous ozone did not significantly affect their survivorship.

The antiviral activity of some flavonoids against CoVs is presumed directly caused by inhibiting 3C-like protease (3CLpro). Here, we applied a flavonoid library to systematically probe inhibitory compounds against SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Herbacetin, rhoifolin and pectolinarin were found to efficiently block the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The interaction of the three flavonoids was confirmed using a tryptophan-based fluorescence method, too. An induced-fit docking analysis indicated that S1, S2 and S3' sites are involved in binding with flavonoids. The comparison with previous studies showed that Triton X-100 played a critical role in objecting false positive or overestimated inhibitory activity of flavonoids.

Understanding hesitancy towards immunization is even more important nowadays, with the continuous threat of COVID-19 pandemic. Medical conspiracy beliefs, scientific skepticism, as well as low trust in governmental institutions, and evidence-based knowledge all have troubling effects on immunization. OBJECTIVE: To examine how these factors cross-react to influence vaccine behavior against any vaccine preventable disease (VPD), we hypothesized a model consisting of the belief in conspiracy theories as the predictor, and as the mediators subjective and objective vaccine knowledge, and trust in the health care system and science. The model was tested by examining the vaccine intentions for the children and self for any VPD. METHODS: Two separate studies were conducted on the representative samples of Serbian population; the first study investigated the intentions for child vaccination and the second study examined the vaccine intentions against any VPD, including adult vaccination. We used path analysis followed by logistic regression to analyze the data. RESULTS: The results revealed high vaccine hesitancy motivated by the belief in the vaccine conspiracy theories, through its effect on reduced trust in medical science and institutions, and low objective vaccine knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study may be used to implement appropriate policy changes and implementation of the public health campaigns to promote immunization with a wide range of vaccines against common diseases, such as measles, human papillomaviruses, or pertussis, and novel diseases, such as COVID.","Milosevic Dordevic, J; Mari, S; Vdovic, M; Milosevic, A",Soc Sci Med,72,14

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective case-control study of consecutive pregnancies complicated by SARS-CoV-2 infection during the second half of pregnancy matched with unaffected women. The z scores of head circumference, abdominal circumference, femur length, and estimated fetal weight were compared between the two groups. Fetal growth was assessed by analyzing the growth velocity of head circumference, abdominal circumference, femur length, and estimated fetal weight between the second- and third-trimester scans. Similarly, changes in the pulsatility index of uterine, umbilical, and middle cerebral arteries, and their ratios were compared between the two study groups. RESULTS: Forty-nine consecutive pregnancies complicated, and 98 not complicated, by SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. General baseline and pregnancy characteristics were similar between pregnant women with and those without SARS-CoV-2 infection. There was no difference in head circumference, abdominal circumference, femur length, and estimated fetal weight z scores between pregnancies complicated and those not complicated by SARS-CoV-2 infection at both the second- and third-trimester scans. Likewise, there was no difference in the growth velocity of all these body parameters between the two study groups. Finally, there was no difference in the pulsatility index of both maternal and fetal Doppler scans throughout gestation between the two groups.

METHODS: The prospective observational multicentre study carried out from 1 March till 30 June 2020 included adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support or high-flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNO). RESULTS: Seventy-four patients, 46 males and 28 females, median age 67.5 (Q1-Q3: 56-75) years, were included. Sixty-four patients (86.5%) had comorbidity. Sixty-six patients (89.2%) were mechanically ventilated, four of them received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy. Eight patients (10.8%) were treated with non-invasive ventilation and HFNO only. The median of intensive care unit (ICU) stay was 22.5 days. Eighteen patients (24.3%) needed continuous renal replacement therapy. Thirty patients (40.5%) died. Age and acute kidney injury were identified as independent predictors of in-hospital death, and chronic kidney disease showed trend towards statistical significance for poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Sufficient number of intensive care beds, organ support equipment and well-trained staff is a decisive factor in managing the COVID-19 epidemic. The study focused on the needs of intensive care in the COVID-19 patients. Advanced age and acute kidney injury were identified as independent predictors for in-hospital mortality. When compared to clinical course and ICU management of patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia caused by other pathogens, we observed prolonged need for ventilatory support, high rate of progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome and significant mortality in studied population.","Dzupová, Olga; Moravec, Michal; Bartos, Hynek; Brestovanský, Peter; Tencer, Tomás; Hyánek, Tomás; Berousek, Jan; Krupková, Zdenka; Mosna, Frantisek; Vymazal, Tomás; Benes, Jirí",Cent Eur J Public Health,72,16

Methods: The cost incurred by the hospital in doing 168 heart transplants during a 3-year period was analyzed Costs were divided into direct and indirect costs The direct costs consisted of medical consumables, laboratory investigations, radiology, costs involved in organ harvest and transport, and diet Direct cost was 40 % of the total cost of the procedure and was used as a surrogate for total costing estimates Results: There was a wide variation in direct costs almost tenfold, ranging from INR 240,882 to 2403193 with a mean of 603755 The cost was affected by length of stay in the hospital, whether a patient survived or died and whether the patient died within 7 days of surgery or later It was also affected by patient-specific factors like the INTERMACS status and preoperative creatinine levels The average cost of the entire transplant procedure was INR 1459000 Conclusion: There is a wide variation in the cost incurred by the hospital in doing transplants dictated to a large extent by patient risk profiles A “One package fits all model” is unrealistic The data pertains to the cost to the hospital and not the hospital bill and is therefore relevant to any health care facility, public or private This study provides a framework for Governmental and private insurance agencies to fix the reimbursement rates",,Indian Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery,72,1

Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy is a highly effective treatment for PTSD across trauma-exposed populations, and has been implemented effectively via telehealth. Nevertheless, PE implementation via telehealth may require specific adaptations during the COVID-19 crisis due to public health mandates calling for sheltering in place and physical distancing.

With the emerging global coronavirus disease (CoVID19) pandemic due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, early reports suggested that smell and taste dysfunction were clinical features of CoVID19. Our study aimed to investigate the prevalence of smell and taste disturbances in a cohort of CoVID19 positive patients who were isolated at home and being medically managed through telephone consultation. Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted at St. James's Hospital Dublin, an urban 850 bed tertiary referral centre. 46 out of 50 CoVID19 positive patients, managed through a telephone clinic from the hospital infectious disease department, were assessed for olfactory and gustatory function loss. Results: The median age of participants was 36.5 years (interquartile range (IQR) 27 - 48) and 19 (41%) were male. The majority (31; 67%) never smoked and 17 (37%) reported co-morbidities. Approximately half of patients reported some degree of smell (22; 48%) or taste (25; 54%) function loss. 13 patients (28%) reported a complete loss of sense of smell, 8 (17%) reported a complete loss of sense of taste and 7 (15%) reported simultaneous total loss of both. The median age of patients with any degree of smell disturbance was significantly lower than patients without (median 30.5 years (IQR 24 – 43.25) versus 41 years (IQR 28.25 – 52.75), p = 0.025). The median age of patients with any degree of taste disturbance was lower than those without, but did not reach statistical significance (median 34 years (IQR 24 - 45) versus 40 years (IQR 27.5 – 52.5) p = 0.174). Conclusion: Smell or taste dysfunction were present in our defined subgroup of patients. Further research is required in different population cohorts to build the evidence base for smell and taste dysfunction as clinical indicators of CoVID19 disease and to assess if these symptoms persist after disease resolution.","Kerr, Colm; Hughes, Gerry; McKenna, Louise; Bergin, Colm",Infect.

Pathology specialties explored in the survey include anatomic pathology, surgical pathology, cytopathology, and hematopathology. METHODS: The study used a cross-sectional design in which an online revised reporting survey was deployed to a large national sample represented by pathologists, pathology residents, pathology fellows, pathology managers, and laboratory directors. RESULTS: Qualitative and quantitative results from this survey highlight significant variation in standards for creating, issuing, and tracking quality indicators related to addenda and amendments. The most notable findings were a lack of standardization and the potential for widespread adoption of revised reporting best practices within and between pathology services. CONCLUSIONS: Survey insight provides the potential for improving patient safety outcomes, engaging with consumers of our reports, providing a current state view of revised reporting, and assessing the attitudes of pathologists and laboratory professionals on how their individual approaches and team-based workflows achieve revised reports. The data generated from this survey will provide patient safety opportunities associated with accurate pathology reporting and will encourage further development of optimal pathology revised reporting guidelines.","Spiczka, Amy; Waibel, Liz; Garcia, Edna; Kundu, Iman; Kelly, Melissa; Brown, Ali",Am. j. clin. pathol,72,16

Although there are outbreak reports involving mass gatherings, the contribution to overall transmission is unknown. We used data from a survey of social contact behaviour that specifically asked about contact with groups to estimate the population attributable fraction (PAF) due to groups as the relative change in the basic reproduction number when groups are prevented. Groups of 50+ individuals accounted for 0.5% of reported contact events, and we estimate that the PAF due to groups of 50+ people is 5.4% (95% confidence interval 1.4%, 11.5%). The PAF due to groups of 20+ people is 18.9% (12.7%, 25.7%) and the PAF due to groups of 10+ is 25.2% (19.4%, 31.4%).

Even prior to the pandemic, however, the association between acute infection with influenza and elevated cardiovascular risk was evident. The recently published results of the NHLBI-funded INfluenza Vaccine to Effectively Stop CardioThoracic Events and Decompensated (INVESTED) trial, a 5200 patient comparative effectiveness study of high-dose vs. standard-dose influenza vaccine to reduce cardiopulmonary events and mortality in a high-risk cardiovascular population, found no difference between strategies. However, the broader implications of influenza vaccine as a strategy to reduce morbidity in high-risk patients remain extremely important, with randomized controlled trial and observational data supporting vaccination in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease. Given a favourable risk-benefit profile and widespread availability at generally low cost, we contend that influenza vaccination should remain a centrepiece of cardiovascular risk mitigation and describe the broader context of underutilization of this strategy. Few therapeutics in medicine offer seasonal efficacy from a single administration with generally mild, transient side effects, and exceedingly low rates of serious adverse effects. Infection control measures such as physical distancing, hand washing, and the use of masks during the COVID-19 pandemic have already been associated with substantially curtailed incidence of influenza outbreaks across the globe.

Methods: We performed a retrospective review of all patients seen at three radiation oncology departments within the ""XXXX"" Health system in ""XXXX"" during the initial COVID-19 surge. Primary end points were to define and quantify COVID-related, radiation-specific care changes, and to identify predictive factors of experiencing COVID-related care changes. Results: 545 cancer patients were seen during the study period, 99 of whom (18.1%) experienced >1 COVID-related care change. Radiation treatment (RT) delays were most common, accounting for 51.5% of all care changes. Physician-directed delays accounted for 41.2% of RT delays, while patient fears, COVID testing, and access barriers were responsible for 27.5%, 17.6%, and 13.7%, respectively. Patient age (p=0.040), intent of treatment (p=0.047), and cancer type (p<0.001) were significantly associated with experiencing a COVID-related care change, as we found that older, curative intent, and rectal cancer patients were more likely to experience care changes. On multivariate analysis, patient age remained significant when controlling for treatment intent and cancer type. Conclusion: Our study provides a perspective on how care was adapted to protect cancer patients during a pandemic while maximizing disease control. The positive correlation between age and likelihood of care changes may reflect extra precaution taken with older patients given their vulnerability to severe COVID illness; while the lower observed likelihood of COVID-related care changes among patients undergoing palliative RT may reflect either the more urgent needs addressed by palliative RT or may simply be logistical, as palliative radiation is often delivered in short courses with less exposure risk. It will be crucial to assess adaptations others have implemented and monitor how they impact patient outcomes.","Pendyala, Praveen; Goglia, Alexander G; Mattes, Malcolm D; Grann, Alison; Huang, David; Wagman, Raquel T; Yehia, Zeinab Abou; Yoon, Jennifer; Ennis, Ronald D",Adv Radiat Oncol,72,1

It came as an even greater surprise that it would be Texas - arguably one of the world's energy capitals - that failed to provide sufficient power to its residents. This paper explores the events that led to the outage, the experiences of those who lived through it, and the situation in Texas one to two months after the event. We have taken an ethnographic approach to capture both the empirical aspects of the situation, and the more interpretive descriptions of the accounts and thoughts of the participants.

Although there is some guidance from local and national organizations, the principal investigator (PI) is ultimately responsible for determining the risk-benefit ratio of conducting, rescheduling, or cancelling each research visit. The PI should take into consideration the ethical principles of research, local/national guidance, the community risk of the pandemic in their locale, staffing strain, and the risk involved to each participant, to ultimately decide on the course of action. While balancing the rights and protection of the human subject, we seldom examine patients' views and opinions about their scheduled research visit(s). This article discusses the ethical principles of beneficence and autonomy in helping the decision-making process. We discuss ways to weigh-in local and national guidance, staffing strain, and institutional support into the decision-making process and outline potential changes needed for regulatory bodies depending on the decision. Further, we discuss the need to weigh-in the individual risk-benefit ratio for each participant and present a decision tree to navigate this complex process.

In this study, we present the outlines of ethical thinking and the measures implemented to try to respect our basic values of care, in the specific environment of an oncology hospital. METHODS: Our ethics committee created an ethical watch system based on 24/7 shifts to assist practitioners in their daily decisions. We discuss the challenges faced by patients with cancer during the pandemic, such as access to critical care and ethical dilemmas in the context of resource scarcity, as well as the issue of isolation of patients. We also debate the restrictions in access to oncology care in a health context strongly 'prioritised' against COVID-19. RESULTS: In all areas of an ethical dilemma, either for sorting out access to critical care or for the dramatic consequences of prolonged isolation of patients, our common thread was our attempt to protect, whenever possible, the principles of deontological ethics by strictly resisting utilitarian pressure. Respecting democratic health decision-making processes is a cornerstone of ethically relevant decisions, including in the context of a sanitary crisis. CONCLUSION: The role of an ethics committee related to real-life situations includes not only a reflexive perspective in respect of fundamental principles, but also the help to enlighten and resolve ethical dilemmas in complex clinical situations. This ethical watch team assists physicians in decision-making, promoting the supportive and palliative dimension of care with a holistic approach.","Blot, François; Dumont, Sarah N; Vigouret-Viant, Laurence; Verotte, Nelly; Rossignol, Julien; Rieutord, André; Fournier-Bidoz, Nathalie; De Jésus, Anne; Dauchy, Sarah; Chardonnet, Florent; Baldini, Capucine; Altea, Anna",BMJ support. palliat. care (Online),72,13

There is limited evidence exploring whether end-of-life symptom control in this group requires new or adapted guidance. AIM: To review whether prescribing for symptom control in patients dying with COVID-19 adhered to existing local guidance or whether there was deviation which may represent a need for revised guidance or specialist support in particular patient groups. DESIGN/SETTING: A retrospective review of the electronic patient record of 61 hospital inpatients referred to the specialist palliative care team with swab-confirmed COVID-19 who subsequently died over a 1-month period. Intubated patients were excluded. RESULTS: In all, 83% (40/48) of patients were prescribed opioids at a starting dose consistent with existing local guidelines. In seven of eight patients where higher doses were prescribed, this was on specialist palliative care team advice. Mean total opioid dose required in the last 24 h of life was 14 mg morphine subcutaneous equivalent, and mean total midazolam dose was 9.5 mg. For three patients in whom non-invasive ventilation was in place higher doses were used. CONCLUSION: Prescription of end-of-life symptom control drugs for COVID-19 fell within the existing guidance when supported by specialist palliative care advice. While some patients may require increased doses, routine prescription of higher starting opioid and benzodiazepine doses beyond existing local guidance was not observed.","Jackson, Timothy; Hobson, Katie; Clare, Hannah; Weegmann, Daniel; Moloughney, Catherine; McManus, Sally",Palliat Med,72,30

This sequencing is used to select targeted therapy and monitor nonresponding or progressive tumors to identify mechanisms of therapeutic resistance. Our study objective was to review available coverage policies for cancer ctDNA-based testing panels to examine trends from 2015 to 2019. METHODS: We analyzed publicly available private payer policies and Medicare national coverage determinations and local coverage determinations (LCDs) for ctDNA-based panel tests for cancer. We coded variables for each year representing policy existence, covered clinical scenario, and specific ctDNA test covered. Descriptive analyses were performed. RESULTS: We found that 38% of private payer coverage policies provided coverage of ctDNA-based panel testing as of July 2019. Most private payer policy coverage was highly specific: 87% for non-small cell lung cancer, 47% for EGFR gene testing, and 79% for specific brand-name tests. There were 8 final, 2 draft, and 2 future effective final LCDs (February 3 and March 15, 2020) that covered non-FDA-approved ctDNA-based tests. The draft and future effective LCDs were the first policies to cover pan-cancer use. CONCLUSIONS: Coverage of ctDNA-based panel testing for cancer indications increased from 2015 to 2019. The trend in private payer and Medicare coverage is an increasing number of coverage policies, number of positive policies, and scope of coverage. We found that Medicare coverage policies are evolving to pan-cancer uses, signifying a significant shift in coverage frameworks. Given that genomic medicine is rapidly changing, payers and policymakers (eg, guideline developers) will need to continue to evolve policies to keep pace with emerging science and standards in clinical care.","Douglas, Michael P; Gray, Stacy W; Phillips, Kathryn A",J Natl Compr Canc Netw,72,24

The outcome of interest was composite poor outcome, defined as a combined endpoint of mortality, severity, need for invasive mechanical ventilation and need for intensive care unit care. Severity followed the included studies' criteria. RESULTS: There are 10 399 patients from 21 studies. Elevated LDH was present in 44% (34%-53%) of the patients. Meta-regression analysis showed that diabetes was correlated with elevated LDH (OR 1.01 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.02), p=0.038), but not age (p=0.710), male (p=0.068) and hypertension (p=0.969). Meta-analysis showed that elevated LDH was associated with composite poor outcome (OR 5.33 (95% CI 3.90 to 7.31), p<0.001; I2: 77.5%). Subgroup analysis showed that elevated LDH increased mortality (OR 4.22 (95% CI 2.49 to 7.14), p<0.001; I2: 89%). Elevated LDH has a sensitivity of 0.74 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.85), specificity of 0.69 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.78), positive likelihood ratio of 2.4 (95% CI 1.9 to 2.9), negative likelihood ratio of 0.38 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.55), diagnostic OR of 6 (95% CI 4 to 9) and area under curve of 0.77 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.80). Elevated LDH would indicate a 44% posterior probability and non-elevated LDH would in indicate 11% posterior probability for poor prognosis.

Using fluid-phase luciferase immune precipitation (LIPS) assays, we characterized IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies to the spike receptor binding domain (RBD), S1+S2, nucleocapsid, and ORF6 to ORF10 of SARS-CoV-2, to the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 betacoronaviruses spike S2, and the H1N1Ca2009 flu virus hemagglutinin. Sequential samples at 1 and 3 months after hospital discharge were also tested for SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies in 95 patients.RESULTSAntibodies developed rapidly against multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens in 95% of patients by 4 weeks after symptom onset and IgG to the RBD increased until the third month of follow-up. We observed a major synchronous expansion of antibodies to the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 spike S2. A likely coinfection with influenza was neither linked to a more severe presentation of the disease nor to a worse outcome. Of the measured antibody responses, positivity for IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD was predictive of survival.CONCLUSIONThe measurement of antibodies to selected epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 antigens can offer a more accurate assessment of the humoral response in patients and its impact on survival. The presence of partially cross-reactive antibodies with other betacoronaviruses is likely to impact on serological assay specificity and interpretation.TRIAL REGISTRATIONCOVID-19 Patients Characterization, Biobank, Treatment Response and Outcome Predictor (COVID-BioB).

Twenty-four patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Ezhou Central Hospital from February 1 to March 22, 2020. According to the 28-day prognosis, they were assigned to a death group and a survival group. On the 3rd day of ICU admission, peripheral blood and alveolar lavage fluid were collected for examination of lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory factors by flow cytometry and immunoturbidimetry, respectively. The CD3+ , CD4+ , and CD8+ cell counts in alveolar lavage fluid and serum were significantly higher in the survival group than those of the death group (p < .05).

There is currently no evidence to support the use of S.nigra berry for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Given the body of evidence from preclinical studies demonstrating the antiviral effects of S.nigra berry, alongside the results from clinical studies involving influenza viral infections included in this review, pre-clinical research exploring the potential effects of S.nigra berry on COVID-19 are encouraged. Verdict: The evidence included in this review is mostly derived from clinical studies involving adult participants and examining short-term use of commercial formulations of S.nigra berry for up to 16 days. Findings from included studies suggest that mono-herbal preparations of S.nigra berry (in extract or lozenge formulation) may reduce influenza-type symptoms, including fever, headache, nasal congestion and nasal mucous discharge in adults, when taken within the first 48 hours of symptom onset. Within 2-4 days of S.nigra treatment, most adult participants experienced significant symptom reduction, by an average of 50%. Evidence regarding the effectiveness of S.nigra berry on the symptom of cough, and need for/use of medicines (including antibiotics) to treat acute respiratory infections, is currently unclear and inconsistent. Adverse events were rare with no serious events reported. Adverse events, reported in two studies, were more common in comparators than in treatments. There is currently no reliable or sufficient scientific evidence to support the use of S.nigra in pregnant or lactating women.","Harnett, Joanna; Oakes, Kerrie; Carè, Jenny; Leach, Matthew; Brown, Danielle; Cramer, Holger; Pinder, Tobey-Ann; Steel, Amie; Anheyer, Dennis",Adv Integr Med,72,1

Currently, COVID-19 has spread widely around the world, affecting more than seventy countries. China, with a huge burden of this disease, has taken strong measures to control the spread and improve the curative rate of COVID-19. In this review, we summarized the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of COVID-19. A comprehensive understanding will help to control the disease.","Ge, Huipeng; Wang, Xiufen; Yuan, Xiangning; Xiao, Gong; Wang, Chengzhi; Deng, Tianci; Yuan, Qiongjing; Xiao, Xiangcheng",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,72,24

We conducted a retrospective systematic study to describe the electroencephalography (EEG) characteristics in this disease, looking for specific patterns. METHODS: EEGs performed in patients with positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2 between 25/03/2020 and 06/05/2020 in the University Hospital of Bicêtre were independently reviewed by two experienced neurologists. We used the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society's terminology for the description of abnormal patterns. EEGs were classified into five categories, from normal to critically altered. Interobserver reliability was calculated using Cohen's kappa coefficient. Medical records were reviewed to extract demographics, clinical, imaging and biological data. RESULTS: Forty EEGs were reviewed in 36 COVID-19 patients, 18 in intensive care units (ICU) and 22 in medicine units. The main indications were confusion or fluctuating alertness for 23 (57.5%) and delayed awakening after stopping sedation in ICU in six (15%). EEGs were normal to mildly altered in 23 (57.5%) contrary to the 42.5% where EEG alterations were moderate in four (10%), severe in eight (20%) and critical in five (12.5%). Generalized periodic discharges (GPDs), multifocal periodic discharges (MPDs) or rhythmic delta activity (RDA) were found in 13 recordings (32.5%). EEG alterations were not stereotyped or specific. They could be related to an underlying morbid status, except for three ICU patients with unexplained encephalopathic features. CONCLUSION: In this first systematic analysis of COVID-19 patients who underwent EEG, over half of them presented a normal recording pattern. EEG alterations were not different from those encountered in other pathological conditions.","Petrescu, Ana-Maria; Taussig, Delphine; Bouilleret, Viviane",Neurophysiol Clin,72,5
441408,441408,441408,Circling death,13.424941,4.794203,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic, all scientific medical activities were shifted to an online format, in the form of webinars, to maintain continuing medical education (CME). We aimed to assess physicians' attitude among different medical specialties towards this sudden and unexpected shift of traditional face-to-face meetings into webinars, and to suggest future recommendations. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, internet-based survey study using a 25-item questionnaire, from November 1 and November 15, 2020. The survey was created and distributed to physicians from different medical and surgical specialties and from different countries via several social media platforms, using a snowball technique. RESULTS: A total of 326 physicians responded; 165 (50.6%) were females, mean age of responders was 38.7 ± 7.5 years. The majority of responses (93.2%) came from Arab countries. Of them, 195 (59.8%) reported attending more webinars compared to the same period last year, with average of 3 per month. As regard to the general impression; 244 (74.8%) were ""strongly satisfied"" or ""satisfied"", with the most satisfaction for ""training courses: by 268 (82.2%), and ""International conferences"" by 218 (66.9%). However, 246 respondents (75.5%) felt overwhelmed with the number and frequency of webinars during the pandemic, 171 (52.5%) reported attending less than 25% of webinars they are invited to, 205 (62.8%) disagreed that webinars can replace in-person meetings after the pandemic, and 239 (73.3%) agreed that online meetings need proper regulations. CONCLUSIONS: Webinars comprised a major avenue for education during COVID-19 pandemic, with initial general satisfaction among physicians. However, this paradigm shift was sudden and lacked proper regulations. Despite initial satisfaction, the majority of physicians felt overwhelmed with the number and frequency of webinars. Physicians' satisfaction is crucial in planning future educational activities, and considering that this current crisis will most likely have long lasting effects, webinars should be viewed as complementing traditional in-person methods, rather than replacement. In this study, we are suggesting recommendations to help future regulation of this change.","Ismail, Ismail Ibrahim; Abdelkarim, Ahmed; Al-Hashel, Jasem Y",PLoS One,72,24

However, in case of the SARS-CoV-2, the low divergence of near-identical genomes sequenced over a short period of time makes conventional analysis infeasible. Using a novel method, we identified 225 anomalous SARS-CoV-2 genomes of likely recombinant origins out of the first 87,695 genomes to be released, several of which have persisted in the population. Bolotie is specifically designed to perform a rapid search for inter-clade recombination events over extremely large datasets, facilitating analysis of novel isolates in seconds. In cases where raw sequencing data was available, we were able to rule out the possibility that these samples represented co-infections by analyzing the underlying sequence reads.

Research in TSC has greatly benefited from the University of California Riverside and University of East Anglia (UCR/UEA) Time Series Archives. On the other hand, the advancement in Time Series Forecasting relies on time series forecasting competitions such as the Makridakis competitions, NN3 and NN5 Neural Network competitions, and a few Kaggle competitions. Each year, thousands of papers proposing new algorithms for TSC and TSF have utilized these benchmarking archives. These algorithms are designed for these specific problems, but may not be useful for tasks such as predicting the heart rate of a person using photoplethysmogram (PPG) and accelerometer data. We refer to this problem as Time Series Regression (TSR), where we are interested in a more general methodology of predicting a single continuous value, from univariate or multivariate time series. This prediction can be from the same time series or not directly related to the predictor time series and does not necessarily need to be a future value or depend heavily on recent values. To the best of our knowledge, research into TSR has received much less attention in the time series research community and there are no models developed for general time series regression problems. Most models are developed for a specific problem. Therefore, we aim to motivate and support the research into TSR by introducing the first TSR benchmarking archive. This archive contains 19 datasets from different domains, with varying number of dimensions, unequal length dimensions, and missing values. In this paper, we introduce the datasets in this archive and did an initial benchmark on existing models.","Tan, Chang Wei; Bergmeir, Christoph; Petitjean, Francois; Webb, Geoffrey I.",,72,16

It is unknown whether the advantages of LUS implementation could be paired with deep learning (DL) techniques to match or exceed human-level, diagnostic specificity among similar appearing, pathological LUS images. DESIGN: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on LUS images with B lines of different aetiologies. CNN diagnostic performance, as validated using a 10% data holdback set, was compared with surveyed LUS-competent physicians. SETTING: Two tertiary Canadian hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 612 LUS videos (121 381 frames) of B lines from 243 distinct patients with either (1) COVID-19 (COVID), non-COVID acute respiratory distress syndrome (NCOVID) or (3) hydrostatic pulmonary edema (HPE). RESULTS: The trained CNN performance on the independent dataset showed an ability to discriminate between COVID (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 1.0), NCOVID (AUC 0.934) and HPE (AUC 1.0) pathologies. This was significantly better than physician ability (AUCs of 0.697, 0.704, 0.967 for the COVID, NCOVID and HPE classes, respectively), p<0.01. CONCLUSIONS: A DL model can distinguish similar appearing LUS pathology, including COVID-19, that cannot be distinguished by humans.

The susceptibility of the variant strains to neutralization elicited by the BNT162b2 vaccine supports mass immunization as a central strategy to end the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic globally.","Liu, Jianying; Liu, Yang; Xia, Hongjie; Zou, Jing; Weaver, Scott C; Swanson, Kena A; Cai, Hui; Cutler, Mark; Cooper, David; Muik, Alexander; Jansen, Kathrin U; Sahin, Ugur; Xie, Xuping; Dormitzer, Philip R; Shi, Pei-Yong",Nature (Lond.),72,16

We evaluated the efficacy of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID-19 in health workers. MethodsThis analysis includes data from one ongoing blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with participants aged 18-60 years were randomly assigned to receive the MMR vaccine or a placebo. The primary efficacy analysis included all participants with a positive nasopharyngeal RT-PCR test since their inclusion. ResultsThe MMR vaccine did not prevent the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants in the MMR group, compared with those in the placebo group, had a 48% risk reduction in symptomatic COVID-19 (RR = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.33-0.83; p=0.004) and a 76% risk reduction in COVID-19 treatment (RR = 0.24; 95% CI: 0.06 - 0.88; p = 0.020) with one dose and a 51% risk reduction in COVID-19 symptoms (RR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.31 - 0.78; p = 0.001) and a 78% risk reduction in COVID-19 treatment (RR = 0.22; 95% CI: 0.06 - 0.82; p = 0.015) with two doses.

Despite global efforts to prevent and treat virus infections to limit morbidity and mortality, the continued emergence and re-emergence of new outbreaks as well as common infections such as influenza persist as a health threat. Challenges to the prevention of severe disease after virus infection include both a paucity of protective vaccines as well as the early identification of individuals with the highest risk that may require supportive treatment. Methods: We completed a screen of mice from the Collaborative Cross (CC) that we infected with influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, and West Nile virus. Results: The CC mice exhibited a range of disease manifestations upon infections, and we used this natural variation to identify strains with mortality after infection and strains exhibiting no mortality. We then used comprehensive preinfection immunophenotyping to identify global baseline immune correlates of protection from mortality to virus infection. Conclusions: These data suggest that immune phenotypes might be leveraged to identify humans at highest risk of adverse clinical outcomes upon infection, who may most benefit from intensive clinical interventions, in addition to providing insight for rational vaccine design.","Graham, Jessica B.; Swarts, Jessica L.; Menachery, Vineet D.; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Schäfer, Alexandra; Plante, Kenneth S.; Morrison, Clayton R.; Voss, Kathleen M.; Green, Richard; Choonoo, Gabrielle; Jeng, Sophia; Miller, Darla R.; Mooney, Michael A.; McWeeney, Shannon K.; Ferris, Martin T.; De Villena, Fernando Pardo-Manuel; Gale, Michael; Heise, Mark T.; Baric, Ralph S.; Lund, Jennifer M.",J.

The ensuing uncertainty has led to the emergence of heightened volatility in prices of crude oil futures. Whether such news has predictive value for the volatility of crude oil futures during the COVID-19 pandemic is examined in this research. We proposed a modeling framework, genetic algorithm regularization online extreme learning machine with forgetting factor (GA-RFOS-ELM), to estimate the effects of news during the COVID-19 pandemic on the volatility of crude oil futures. GA-RFOS-ELM could learn block-by-block with fixed or varying block size when considering the block own valid period. The experimental results illustrate that news during the COVID-19 pandemic has more predictive information, which is crucial for short-term volatility forecasting of crude oil futures. The novel approach illustrates that online update learning ability is needed during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could be effective and efficient in volatility forecasting of crude oil futures.

A 31-year-old female was readmitted to the emergency department after 3 days of sleep disturbance, intermittent paranoid delusions, auditory hallucinations, and agitation that started after the favipiravir treatment was initiated. A physical examination revealed disorganized speech, distorted orientation, and agitation. All laboratory tests, including drug screening and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, were normal. After excluding all the other causes of acute psychosis, favipiravir treatment was discontinued, antipsychotic treatment was started, and the patient was admitted to the psychiatric ward. The symptoms resolved on the second day of hospitalization. Although acute viral illness does seldomly cause psychosis in patients with increased inflammatory response, in the presented case, none of the inflammatory markers were positive, and acute psychosis was attributed to the loading dose of favipiravir.

Recent data on the rate of airway infections and factors influencing their spread in refugee reception centers is scarce. Methods: A retrospective, cross-sectional study of de-identified medical records with a focus on respiratory infections in underage refugees was conducted at two large German refugee reception centers. Results: In total, medical data from n = 10,431 refugees over an observational period of n = 819 days was analyzed. Among pediatric patients (n = 4289), 55.3% presented at least once to the on-site medical ward with an acute respiratory infection or signs thereof. In 38.4% of pediatric consultations, acute airway infections or signs thereof were present. Airway infections spiked during colder months and were significantly more prevalent amongst preschool and resettled children. Their frequency displayed a positive correlation with the number of refugees housed at the reception centers. Conclusions: We show that respiratory infections are a leading cause for morbidity in young refugees and that their rate is influenced age, season, status, and residential density. This illustrates the need to protect refugee children from contracting airway infections which may also reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the current pandemic.","Müller, Frank; Hummers, Eva; Hillermann, Nele; Dopfer, Christian; Jablonka, Alexandra; Friede, Tim; Simmenroth, Anne; Wetzke, Martin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),72,21

We aimed to assess whether patients with a systemic rheumatic disease might be at increased risk for hyperinflammation and respiratory failure from COVID-19. Methods: We did a retrospective, comparative cohort study of patients aged 18 years or older admitted to hospital with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 at Mass General Brigham (Boston, USA). We identified patients by a search of electronic health records and matched patients with a systemic rheumatic disease 1:5 to comparators. We compared individual laboratory results by case status and extracted laboratory results and COVID-19 outcomes for each participant. We calculated the COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation score (cHIS), a composite of six domains (a score of &#8805;2 indicating hyperinflammation) and used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for COVID-19 outcomes by hyperinflammation and case status. Findings: We identified 57 patients with a systemic rheumatic disease and 232 matched comparators who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between Jan 30 and July 7, 2020; 38 (67%) patients with a rheumatic disease were female compared with 158 (68%) matched comparators. Patients with a systemic rheumatic disease had higher peak median neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (9·6 [IQR 6·4-22·2] vs 7·8 [4·5-16·5]; p=0·021), lactate dehydrogenase concentration (421 U/L [297-528] vs 345 U/L [254-479]; p=0·044), creatinine concentration (1·2 mg/dL [0·9-2·0] vs 1·0 mg/dL [0·8-1·4], p=0·014), and blood urea nitrogen concentration (31 mg/dL [15-61] vs 23 mg/dL [13-37]; p=0·033) than comparators, but median C-reactive protein concentration (149·4 mg/L [76·4-275·3] vs 116·3 mg/L [58·8-225·9]; p=0·11) was not significantly different. Patients with a systemic rheumatic disease had higher peak median cHIS than comparators (3 [1-5] vs 2 [1-4]; p=0·013). All patients with a peak cHIS of 2 or more had higher odds of admission to intensive care (OR 3·45 [95% CI 1·98-5·99]), mechanical ventilation (66·20 [8·98-487·80]), and in-hospital mortality (16·37 [4·75-56·38]) than patients with a peak cHIS of less than 2. In adjusted analyses, patients with a rheumatic disease had higher odds of admission to intensive care (2·08 [1·09-3·96]) and mechanical ventilation (2·60 [1·32-5·12]) than comparators, but not in-hospital mortality (1.78 [0·79-4·02]). Among patients who were discharged from hospital, risk of rehospitalisation (1·08 [0·37-3·16]) and mortality within 60 days (1·20 [0·58-2·47]) was similar in patients and comparators. Interpretation: Patients with a systemic rheumatic disease who were admitted to hospital for COVID-19 had increased risk for hyperinflammation, kidney injury, admission to intensive care, and mechanical ventilation compared with matched comparators. However, among patients who survived, post-discharge outcomes were not significantly different. The cHIS identified patients with hyperinflammation, which was strongly associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes in both patients with a rheumatic disease and comparators. Clinicians should be aware that patients with systemic rheumatic diseases and COVID-19 could be susceptible to hyperinflammation and poor hospital outcomes.

Microfluidic on-chip PCR platforms provide highly efficient and small-volume bioassay for point-of-care diagnostic applications. Here we report ultrafast, real-time, and on-chip nanoplasmonic PCR for rapid and quantitative molecular diagnostics at point-of-care level. The plasmofluidic PCR chip comprises glass nanopillar arrays with Au nanoislands and gas-permeable microfluidic channels, which contain reaction microchamber arrays, a precharged vacuum cell, and a vapor barrier. The on-chip configuration allows both spontaneous sample loading and microbubble-free PCR reaction during which the plasmonic nanopillar arrays result in ultrafast photothermal cycling. After rapid sample loading less than 3 min, two-step PCR results for 40 cycles show rapid amplification in 264 s for lambda-DNA, and 306 s for plasmids expressing SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein. In addition, the in situ cyclic real-time quantification of amplicons clearly demonstrates the amplification efficiencies of more than 91%. This PCR platform can provide rapid point-of-care molecular diagnostics in helping slow the fast-spreading pandemic.","Kang, Byoung-Hoon; Lee, Youngseop; Yu, Eun-Sil; Na, Hamin; Kang, Minhee; Huh, Hee Jae; Jeong, Ki-Hun",ACS nano,72,4

The novel member of Coronaviridae causing COVID-19 disease is named as SARS-Cov-2. Its first case was reported in China by the end of 2019, but its exponential spread has wrapped entire globe, suspended and is penalizing mankind. A retrospective meta-analysis study showed that outbreaks of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and SARS-Cov-1 (Coronaviridae), influenza infection H1N1 and West-African Ebola caused lower mortality than this new pandemic COVID-19. Virus has appeared as a new human pathogen so to counter COVID-19 no specific vaccine, monoclonal antibodies have been manufactured till day. The outbreak of novel Coronavirus is treated with antimicrobial drugs but they have their own mild side effects. But the drastic spread of COVID-19 compels us also to use other ways to counter pandemic. Thus, passive immunization can be opted to hold back this mysterious virus. Passive immunization has been in use since early 20th century and showed its effectiveness against all previous infectious outbreaks including MERS and SARS-Cov-1 members of Coronaviridae.

The standard technique for CVP measurement is invasive, requiring the insertion of a catheter into a jugular vein, with potential complications. On the other hand, the current non-invasive methods, mainly based on ultrasounds, remain operator-dependent and are unsuitable for use in the home environment. In this paper, we will introduce a novel, non-invasive device for the hospital, office and home assessment of CVP. Methods: After describing the measurement concept, we will report a preliminary experimental study enrolling 5 voluntary healthy subjects to evaluate the VenCoM measurements’ repeatability, and the system’s capability in measuring small elicited venous pressure variations (2 mmHg), as well as an induced venous hypertension within a pathological range (12÷ 20 mmHg). Results: The experimental measurements showed a repeatability of ± 1mmHg. The VenCoM device was able to reliably detect the elicited venous pressure variations and the simulated congestive status. Discussion and Conclusion: The proposed non-invasive VenCoM device is able to provide a fast and repeatable CVP estimate, having a wide spectrum of potential clinical applications, including the monitoring of venous congestion in heart failure patients and in subjects with renal and hepatic dysfunction, as well as pulmonary hypertension (PH) that can be extended to pneumonia COVID-19 patients even after recovery. The device needs to be tested further on a large sample size of both healthy and pathological subjects, to systematically validate its reliability and impact in clinical setting.","Marcelli, Emanuela Cercenelli Laura Bortolani Barbara Marini Saverio Arfilli Luca Capucci Alessandro Plicchi Gianni",Medical Devices : Evidence and Research,72,16

However, systemic respiratory vaccines generally provide limited protection against viral replication and shedding within the airway, as this requires a local mucosal secretory IgA response. Indeed, preclinical studies of adenovirus and mRNA candidate vaccines demonstrated persistent virus in nasal swabs despite preventing COVID-19. This suggests that systemically vaccinated patients, while asymptomatic, may still be become infected and transmit live virus from the upper airway. COVID-19 is known to spread through respiratory droplets and aerosols. Furthermore, significant evidence has shown that many clinic and surgical endonasal procedures are aerosol generating. Until further knowledge is acquired regarding mucosal immunity following systemic vaccination, otolaryngology providers should maintain precautions against viral transmission to protect the proportion of persistently vulnerable patients who exhibit subtotal vaccine efficacy or waning immunity or who defer vaccination.","Bleier, Benjamin S; Ramanathan, Murugappan; Lane, Andrew P",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,72,29

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of hearing loss among children with CDH and compare it to age-matched controls. METHODS: We used population-based datasets to compare the number of hearing loss diagnoses in children younger than 10â¯years-of-age born between 1992 and 2009 with CDH to date-of-birth matched controls without CDH. Factors associated with CDH disease severity were analyzed to determine their effect on the prevalence of hearing loss. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine if selection bias of improved care over the course of the study affected hearing loss in CDH patients. The prevalences of hearing loss were compared using Fisher's exact tests and statistical significance was defined as pâ¯<â¯0.05. RESULTS: A total of 529 children, 38 CDH cases and their 491 date-of-birth matched controls, met the inclusion criteria. Hearing loss was found in 7 children with CDH (18.4%) compared to 26 (5.3%) controls; the risk ratio (RR) of hearing loss was 3.48 (95%CIâ¯=â¯1.61-7.49, pâ¯=â¯0.006). There was no association between CDH disease severity and hearing loss. CONCLUSIONS: CDH is associated with hearing loss compared to the general population. Our results suggest that congenital factors may contribute to hearing loss in CDH more than perinatal exposures.

To support the pathologists, a new technical professional role, the pathologists' assistant (PA), has been introduced. METHODS: We decided to carry out a retrospective analysis on PAs' performance. This was compared with that of junior/senior pathologists in the amount and type of surgical specimens examined, the number of lymph node retrieved in colorectal resections, the number of cases needing a second grossing procedure and the average time spent in grossing. As the COVID-19 pandemic period in fact resulted in a dramatic reduction of histological cases in our department, we divided PA activities into two periods, according to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: 'Simple' specimens made up the majority (92%) of the specimens examined by PAs in pre-COVID-19 period while 'complex' specimens, often neoplastic, represented the minor part (7%). However, 'simple' specimens dropped to 81% and 'complex' specimens rose to 18% in the COVID-19 period, when PAs had the chance to test themselves with more complicated surgical samples, under the supervision of a pathologist. Lymph node retrieval rate and average time spent in grossing are in line with literature data and confirm that PAs performance is comparable with pathologists' one, in selected settings. CONCLUSION: In our experience, PA has represented a fundamental time-saving resource for the pathologists, who can devote time almost exclusively to diagnostic reporting.","Bortesi, Mara; Marchetti, Marialisa; Arpaia, Ilaria; Marchi, Letizia; Ganassi, Marilena; Zanetti, Eleonora; Fontanesi, Cristina; Costantini, Massimo; Piana, Simonetta",J. clin. pathol,72,1

It begins with a discussion outlining the origins of research impact and the use of evidence in policymaking. This is followed by an overview of the Australian policy context that shapes academic research and its impact. We argue that although the relationship between EBPM and research impact can be viewed as a symbiotic one, there are some tensions that arise in practice. Such difficulties can be further exacerbated when using research to inform policy in times of crisis, as illustrated by governing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The insights provided contribute to our understanding of impact and are of value to policymakers and academic researchers as they help clarify the changing context within which they operate.","Gunn, A.; Mintrom, M.",Australian Journal of Public Administration,72,1

Population trends from online searches were used to identify social determinants of health (SDoH) concepts that trended high at the outset of the pandemic from a list of SDoH topics from the World Health Organization (WHO). The trending concepts were then mapped to the knowledge graph and a subsequent analysis of the derived insights, spanning two years, was conducted. This paper suggests an approach to derive new related health and social factors that may have either played a role in, or been affected by, the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, our results show how, from a list of SDoH topics, Food Security, Unemployment trended the highest at the start of the pandemic.

Recently, many reports have demonstrated a potential link between vitamin D and systemic infections, including coronavirus disease 2019. The villi of the small intestine increase the surface area of the intestinal walls, demonstrating exceptionally efficient absorption of nutrients in the lumen and adding digestive secretions. In this study, based on the villi structure, we developed a bio-inspired silver nanovilli-based sandwich-type surface enhanced Raman scattering aptasensor for the ultrasensitive and selective detection of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3. The densely packed nanovilli structure enhanced the Raman signal, forming hotspots owing to its large surface area. Using experiments and electromagnetic simulations, we optimized the nanovilli structure as a SERS sensor. The sandwich-type aptasensor was designed using an aptamer and 4-Phenyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione-methylene blue complex. The nanovilli-based aptasensor could sensitively detect various concentrations of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3, ranging from those found in deficient to excess conditions. The detection limit of the nanovilli-based sandwich-type aptasensor for 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 was 0.001 ng/mL, which is much lower than the deficiency concentration, and was detectable even in the human serum. In addition, our proposed sensor exhibited good repeatability (17.76%) and reproducibility (7.47%). Moreover, the nanovilli-based sandwich-type SERS aptasensor could selectively distinguish 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 from other vitamins. The silver nanovilli-based sandwich-type surface enhanced Raman scattering aptasensor opens a new avenue for the development of a bio-inspired vitamin-sensing platform.","Kim, Woochang; Park, Joohyung; Kim, Woong; Jo, Seongjae; Kim, Minwoo; Kim, Chihyun; Park, Hyunjun; Bang, Doyeon; Lee, Wonseok; Park, Jinsung",Biosens Bioelectron,72,1

METHODS: We developed a structured interview to collect the lived experience of the staff of the pediatric emergency department (PED) of a tertiary referral university hospital in Northern Italy. The open-ended questions were draft according to the suggestions of Canadian colleagues and administered by 1 interviewer, who was part of the PED staff, at the end of March 2020. All the PED staff was interviewed, on a voluntary basis, using purposive sampling. RESULTS: Most respondents declared to be afraid of becoming infected and of infecting their families. The number of patients seen in the PED has decreased, and the cases tend to be more severe. A shift in the clinical approach to the ill child has occurred, the physical examination is problem-oriented, aiming to avoid un-necessary maneuvers and to minimize the number of practitioners involved. The most challenging aspects reported are: (1) performing a physical examination in personal protective equipment (PPE), (2) being updated with rapidly evolving guidelines, and (3) staying focused on the possible COVID-19 clinical presentation without failing in differential diagnosis.

In Spain, the first wave of COVID was particularly virulent. There are few studies about the experiences of midwives providing care during the COVID pandemic and very few have been undertaken in the countries of southern Europe such as Spain. This article sets out to take a more in-depth look at the experiences of midwives who were on the frontline of care during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as to identify new needs and resilience strategies that can help midwives. METHODS: A qualitative methodology of phenomenological tradition was used, interviewing 10 midwives from primary care, hospital and independent care. RESULTS: After content analysis, three central categories emerged: (a) cascade of emotions; (b) professional occupation and concern for the women; (c) resisting the day-to-day; resilience and resistance strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the difficulties, midwives are concerned about the loss of rights and autonomy and about the increased vulnerability of women. Midwives have become aware of the power they have in their actions both in health management and administration, as well as in the care of women, creating strategies to provide dignified care to their users.","Goberna-Tricas, Josefina; Biurrun-Garrido, Ainoa; Perelló-Iñiguez, Carme; Rodríguez-Garrido, Pía",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),72,21

In this study, three explicit mathematical prediction models were applied to forecast the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran and Turkey. These models include a recursive-based method, Boltzmann Function-based model and Beesham's prediction model. These models were exploited to analyze the confirmed and death cases of the first 106 and 87 days of the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran and Turkey, respectively. This application indicates that the three models fail to predict the first 10 to 20 days of data, depending on the prediction model. On the other hand, the results obtained for the rest of the data demonstrate that the three prediction models achieve high values for the determination coefficient, whereas they yielded to different average absolute relative errors. Based on the comparison, the recursive-based model performs the best, while it estimated the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran better than that of in Turkey. Impacts of applying or relaxing control measurements like curfew in Turkey and reopening the low-risk businesses in Iran were investigated through the recursive-based model. Finally, the results demonstrate the merit of the recursive-based model in analyzing various scenarios, which may provide suitable information for health politicians and public health decision-makers.","Niazkar, Majid; Eryilmaz Türkkan, Gökçen; Niazkar, Hamid Reza; Türkkan, Yusuf Alptekin",Comput Math Methods Med,72,4

Nevertheless, as of April 15, 2021, the only recommended treatment in current practice is the ""standard of care"", i.e. the symptomatic management of infection with SARS-CoV-2. This review presents the state of knowledge on COVID-19 in the acute phase (virological, immunological, epidemiological and therapeutic data) available on 15th April, 2021. OUTLOOK: A large number of clinical trials are currently ongoing. It is important to propose to patients the opportunity to participate in clinical trials and to structure the research in order to complete the studies. CONCLUSION: Current management is based on oxygen therapy, thromboprophylaxis and in some cases corticosteroids. No antiviral therapy is currently recommended. These data are constantly evolving.","Basille, D; Andrejak, C",Rev Mal Respir,72,21

MethodsWe conducted a population based cross-sectional study of COVID-19 workplace outbreaks and associated-cases reported in Ontario between April 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021. All outbreaks were manually classified into two digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes. We obtained denominator data from the Statistics Canada Labour Force Survey in order to estimate the incidence of outbreak-associated cases per 100,000,000 hours amongst individuals who reported the majority of hours were worked outside the home. We performed this analysis across industries and in three distinct time periods. ResultsOverall, 12% of cases were attributed to workplace outbreaks among working age adults across our study period. While incidence varied across the time periods, the five industries with the highest incidence rates across our study period were agriculture; healthcare and social assistance; food manufacturing; educational services; and, transportation and warehousing. ConclusionsCertain industries have consistently increased incidence of COVID-19 over the course of the pandemic. These results may assist in ongoing efforts to reduce transmission of COVID-19, by prioritizing resources, as well as industry-specific guidance, vaccination, and public health messaging.","Buchan, Sarah A; Smith, Peter M; Warren, Christine; Murti, Michelle; Mustard, Cameron; Kim, JinHee; Menon, Sandya; Brown, Kevin Antoine; Ingen, Trevor van; Smith, Brendan T",,72,23

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients hospitalized with RT-PCR positive for COVID-19 in our region to assess the prevalence of cancer patients and describe their characteristics and evolution (Cohort 1). Concurrently, a transversal study was carried out in patients on active systemic cancer treatment for symptomatology and seroprevalence (IgG/IgM by ELISA-method) against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Cohort 2). RESULTS: A total of 215 patients (Cohort 1) were admitted to hospital with a confirmed COVID-19 infection between February 28 and April 30, 2020, and 17 died (7.9%). A medical record of cancer was noted in 43 cases (20%), 6 of them required Intensive care unit ICU attention (14%), and 7 died (16%). There were thirty-six patients (83%) who tested IgG/IgM positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients on immunosuppressive therapies presented a lower ratio of seroconversion (40% vs. 8%; p = 0.02). In Cohort 2, 166 patients were included in a symptoms-survey and tested for SARS-CoV-2. Any type of potential COVID-19-related symptom was referred up to 67.4% of patients (85.9% vs. 48.2% vs. 73.9%, for patients on chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapies respectively, p < 0.05). The seroprevalence ratio was 1.8% for the whole cohort with no significant differences by patient or treatment characteristics. CONCLUSION: Patients with cancer present higher risks for hospital needs for COVID-19 infection. The lack of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion may be a concern for patients on immunosuppressive therapies. Patients receiving systematic therapies relayed a high rate of potentially COVID-19-related symptoms, particularly those receiving chemotherapy. However, the seroconversion rate remains low and in the range of general population.","Garde-Noguera, Javier; Fernández-Murga, M Leonor; Giner-Bosch, Vicent; Dominguez-Márquez, Victoria; Sánchez, José García; Soler-Cataluña, Juan José; López Chuliá, Franscica; Honrubia, Beatriz; Piera, Nuria; Llombart-Cussac, Antonio",,72,1

This multi-center prospective study was conducted to determine the incidence of neurological manifestations in hospitalized cases with COVID-19 and assess these symptoms as the predictors of severity and death. METHODS: Hospitalized males and females with COVID-19 who aged over 18 years were included in the study. They were examined by two neurologists at the time of admission. All survived cases were followed for 8 weeks after discharge and 16 weeks if their symptoms had no improvements. RESULTS: We included 873 participants. Of eligible cases, 122 individuals (13.97%) died during hospitalization. The most common non-neurological manifestations were fever (81.1%), cough (76.1%), fatigue (36.1%), and shortness of breath (27.6%). Aging, male gender, co-morbidity, smoking, hemoptysis, chest tightness, and shortness of breath were associated with increased odds of severe cases and/or mortality. There were 561 (64.3%) cases with smell and taste dysfunctions (hyposmia: 58.6%; anosmia: 41.4%; dysguesia: 100%). They were more common among females (69.7%) and non-smokers (66.7%). Hyposmia/anosmia and dysgeusia were found to be associated with reduced odds of severe cases and mortality. Myalgia (24.8%), headaches (12.6%), and dizziness (11.9%) were other common neurological symptoms. Headaches had negative correlation with severity and death due to COVID-19 but myalgia and dizziness were not associated. The cerebrovascular events (n = 10) and status epilepticus (n = 1) were other neurological findings. The partial or full recovery of smell and taste dysfunctions was found in 95.2% after 8 weeks and 97.3% after 16 weeks. The parosmia (30.9%) and phantosmia (9.0%) were also reported during 8 weeks of follow-up. Five cases with mild headaches and 5 cases with myalgia were reported after 16 weeks of discharge. The demyelinating myelitis (n = 1) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (n = 1) were also found during follow-up.

Kollidon 12PF, PEG 4000, and PEO 900k blends resulted in promising filaments that could be extruded at 70 °C and had flexibility similar to commercial PLA filaments. Montelukast sodium (MS), which undergoes hepatic first-pass metabolism, was compounded into polymer blends, and drug-loaded filaments were extruded. All filaments were tested with a 3D printing pen prior to using with the 3D printer for transdermal patches. MS loaded filaments and patches showed similar flexibility with placebo. In vitro drug release studies showed 52% of MS was released in 24 h. Printing on disposable packaging material is presented for the first time with this study.

Challenged by this serious situation, China has taken many measures to contain its transmission. This study aims to systematically review and record these special and effective practices, in hope of benefiting for fighting against the ongoing worldwide pandemic. METHODS: The measures taken by the governments was tracked and sorted on a daily basis from the websites of governmental authorities (e.g. National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China). And the measures were reviewed and summarized by categorizations, figures and tables, showing an ever-changing process of combating with an emerging infectious disease. The population shift levels, daily local new diagnosed cases, daily mortality and daily local new cured cases were used for measuring the effect of the measures. RESULTS: The practices could be categorized into active case surveillance, rapid case diagnosis and management, strict follow-up and quarantine of persons with close contacts, and issuance of guidance to help the public understand and adhere to control measures, plus prompt and effective high-level policy decision, complete activation of the public health system, and full involvement of the society. Along with the measures, the population shift levels, daily local new diagnosed cases, and mortality were decreased, and the daily local new cured cases were increased in China. CONCLUSIONS: China's practices are effective in controlling transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Considering newly occurred situations (e.g. imported cases, work resumption), the control measures may be adjusted.","Xu, Tie-Long; Ao, Mei-Ying; Zhou, Xu; Zhu, Wei-Feng; Nie, He-Yun; Fang, Jian-He; Sun, Xin; Zheng, Bin; Chen, Xiao-Fan",Infect Dis Poverty,72,16

DESIGN AND SETTING: Site visits to 24 long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in Fulton County, Georgia, were conducted between June and July 2020 to assess adherence to current guidelines, provide real-time feedback on potential weaknesses, and identify specific indicators whose implementation or lack thereof was associated with higher or lower prevalence of COVID-19. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four LTCFs were visited, representing 2,580 LTCF residents, among whom 1,004 (39%) were infected with COVID-19. MEASUREMENTS: Overall IPC adherence in LTCFs was analyzed for 33 key indicators across five categories: Hand Hygiene, Disinfection, Social Distancing, PPE, and Symptom Screening. Facilities were divided into Higher- and Lower-prevalence groups based on cumulative COVID-19 infection prevalence to determine differences in IPC implementation. RESULTS: IPC implementation was lowest in the Disinfection category (32%) and highest in the Symptom Screening category (74%). Significant differences in IPC implementation between the Higher- and Lower-prevalence groups were observed in the Social Distancing category (Higher-prevalence group 54% vs Lower-prevalence group 74%, P < .01) and the PPE category (Higher-prevalence group 41% vs Lower-prevalence group 72%, P < .01). CONCLUSION: LTCFs with lower COVID-19 prevalence among residents had significantly greater implementation of IPC recommendations compared to those with higher COVID-19 prevalence, suggesting the utility in adhering to current guidelines to reduce transmission in this vulnerable population.","Telford, Carson T; Bystrom, Cyndra; Fox, Teresa; Holland, David P; Wiggins-Benn, Sherry; Mandani, Anjum; McCloud, Meshell; Shah, Sarita",J. am. geriatr. soc,72,26

492014,492014,492014,2021 Annual Meeting Supplement,13.460716,5.1656146,2021,"Hot weather not only impacts upon human physical comfort and health, but also impacts the way that people access and experience active travel options such as walking and cycling. By evaluating the street thermal environment of a city alongside an assessment of those communities that are the most vulnerable to the effects of heat, we can prioritise areas in which heat mitigation interventions are most needed. In this paper, we propose a new approach for policy makers to determine where to delegate limited resources for heat mitigation with most effective outcomes for the communities. We use eye-level street panorama images and community profiles to provide a bottom-up, human-centred perspective of the city scale assessment, highlighting the situation of urban tree shade provision throughout the streets in comparison with environmental and social-economic status. The approach leverages multiple sources of spatial data including satellite thermal images, Google street view (GSV) images, land use and demographic census data. A deep learning model was developed to automate the classification of streetscape types and percentages at the street- and eye-view level. The methodology is metrics based and scalable which provides a data driven assessment of heat-related vulnerability. The findings of this study first contribute to sustainable development by developing a method to identify geographical areas or neighbourhoods that require heat mitigation; and enforce policies improving tree shade on routes, as a heat adaptation strategy, which will lead to increasing active travel and produce significant health benefits for residents. The approach can be also used to guide post COVID-19 city planning and design.","Sun, Qian Chayn; Macleod, Tania; Both, Alan; Hurley, Joe; Butt, Andrew; Amati, Marco",Sci Total Environ,72,2

METHODS: In this paper, we report a survey on the adoption of the recommended protective behaviours before and during the epidemic. We also assessed demographic correlates, and beliefs (towards COVID-19 and protective behaviours, towards SARS-CoV-2 transmission, social dilemma variables, and perceived external cues) of a representative sample of British residents. Data were collected during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic that spread worldwide in 2020. RESULTS: Results showed a marked increase in the adoption of protective behaviour. We also identified targets for intervention in variables related to transmission of the virus and social dilemma-related beliefs. Sex differences in the adoption of protective measures, as well as differences associated with the frequency of social contacts, were associated with differences in beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest changeable determinants, which could be targeted in global communication about COVID-19, or in interventions targeting specific sub-groups not following the protective measures.","Moussaoui, Lisa S; Ofosu, Nana D; Desrichard, Olivier",Applied psychology.

The phylogeny of this agent, and its potential for human infection, are unknown. METHODS: We used existing metagenomic data from I. scapularis to determine the phylogeny of this tick-associated nematode and employed quantitative PCR to determine if the presence of this agent had an effect on the burden of Borrelia burgdorferi. We also developed a Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System assay using the Av33 antigen as a target to investigate the presence of antibodies against this nematode in 128 serum specimens from patients with Lyme disease and babesiosis. To demonstrate assay utility, we used 15 sera from patients with onchocerciasis as controls. RESULTS: We show that this agent is a new species in the genus Monanema and its presence in vector ticks does not impact the burden of B. burgdorferi. We did not detect IgG antibodies to this agent in 127 of 128 sera from patients with Lyme disease or babesiosis. One sample had reactivity above the threshold, but at the low-level equivalent to the least reactive onchocerciasis sera. This low positive signal could be a result of cross-reacting antibodies, antibodies from a previous infection with a filarial nematode, or, less likely, a exposure to the Ixodes scapularis-associated nematode. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that this nematode contributes to the spectrum of human tick-borne infections.","Tokarz, Rafal; Tagliafierro, Teresa; Ian Lipkin, W; Marques, Adriana R",Parasit Vectors,72,20

In this paper we study the effect of two assessment strategies in an educational context: One based on penalisation, the other based on rewards. Both are applied to assignments where the students develop a project focusing on keeping a low technical debt level, and obtaining a high quality code. We describe the design, tools and context of the strategies applied. SonarQube, a tool commonly used in production environments, is used for measuring the metrics. The penalisation strategy is based on a SonarQube quality gate. The reward strategy is based on a contest, where an automatic judge tool is devised to provide an online leaderboard with a classification based on the SonarQube metrics. An empirical study is conducted to determine which of the strategies works better to help the students/trainees keep the Technical Debt low. Statistically significant results are obtained in 5 of the 8 analysed metrics, showing that the reward strategy works much better. The effect size of the executed statistical tests is analysed, resulting in medium and large effect size in the majority of the analysed metrics.","Crespo, Yania; Gonzalez-Escribano, Arturo; Piattini, Mario",,72,8

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis of claims data. SETTING: The USA; 2018-2019 influenza season. PARTICIPANTS: Main cohort: people with hypertension (HTN) taking an ACEi, ARB or other HTN medications, and experiencing AVRI. Falsification cohort: parallel cohort receiving elective knee or hip replacement. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Main cohort: hospital admission, intensive care unit, acute respiratory distress (ARD), ARD syndrome and all-cause mortality. Falsification cohort: complications after surgery and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: The main cohort included 236 843 episodes of AVRI contributed by 202 629 unique individuals. Most episodes were in women (58.9%), 81.4% in people with Medicare Advantage and 40.3% in people aged 75+ years. Odds of mortality were lower in the ACEi (0.78 (0.74 to 0.83)) and ARB (0.64 (0.61 to 0.68)) cohorts compared with other HTN medications. On all other outcomes, people taking ARBs (but not ACEis) had a >10% reduction in odds of inpatient stays compared with other HTN medications.In the falsification analysis (N=103 353), both ACEis (0.89 (0.80 to 0.98)) and ARBs (0.82 (0.74 to 0.91)) were associated with decreased odds of complications compared with other HTN medications; ARBs (0.64 (0.47 to 0.87)) but not ACEis (0.79 (0.60 to 1.05)) were associated with lower odds of death compared with other HTN medications. CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient use of ARBs was associated with better outcomes with AVRI compared with other medications for HTN. ACEis were associated with reduced risk of death, but with minimal or no reduction in risk of other complications. A falsification analysis conducted to provide context on the possible causal implications of these findings did not provide a clear answer. Further analysis using observational data will benefit from additional approaches to assess causal relationships between these drugs and outcomes in AVRI.","Jeffery, Molly Moore; Cummins, Nathan W; Dempsey, Timothy M; Limper, Andrew H; Shah, Nilay D; Bellolio, Fernanda",BMJ Open,72,23

Operational leaders used data insights and predictions from Data Coronavirus Analytics Research Team to redeploy critical care resources across the hospital system, and real-time data were used daily to make adjustments to staffing and supply decisions. Geographical data were used to triage patients to other hospitals in our system when COVID-19 detected pavilions were at capacity. Additionally, one of the consequences of COVID-19 was the inability for patients to receive elective care leading to extended periods of pain and uncertainty about a disease or treatment.

The same is true for predicting times from hospital admission of COVID-19 patients to intensive care or from start of ventilation (invasive or non-invasive) to extubation. This logical restriction of the data to the period of hospitalisation is associated with a substantial risk that inappropriate methods are used for analysis.

Here, we explored 61,485 sequences of the nucleocapsid (N) protein, a potent diagnostic and prophylactic target, for identifying the mutations to review their roles in real-time polymerase chain reaction based diagnosis and observe consequent impacts. Compared to the Wuhan reference strain, a total of 1034 unique nucleotide mutations were identified in the mutant strains (49.15%, n = 30,221) globally. Of these mutations, 367 occupy primer binding sites including the 3'-end mismatch to the primer-pair of 11 well-characterized primer sets. Noteworthily, CDC (USA) recommended the N2 primer set contained a lower mismatch than the other primer sets. Moreover, 684 amino acid (aa) substitutions were located across 317 (75.66% of total aa) unique positions including 82, 21, and 83 of those in the RNA binding N-terminal domain (NTD), SR-rich region, and C-terminal dimerization domain, respectively. Moreover, 11 in-frame deletions, mostly (n = 10) within the highly flexible linker region, were revealed, and the rest was within the NTD region. Furthermore, we predicted the possible consequence of high-frequency mutations (&#8805;20) and deletions on the tertiary structure of the N protein. Remarkably, we observed that a high frequency (67.94% of mutated sequences) co-occuring mutations (R203K and G204R) destabilized and decreased overall structural flexibility. The N protein of SARS-CoV-2 comprises an average of 1.2 mutations per strain compared to 4.4 and 0.4 in Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and SARS-CoV, respectively. Despite being proposed as the alternative target to spike protein for vaccine and therapeutics, the ongoing evolution of the N protein may challenge these endeavors, thus needing further immunoinformatics analyses. Therefore, continuous monitoring is required for tracing the ongoing evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein in prophylactic and diagnostic interventions.","Rahman, M Shaminur; Islam, M Rafiul; Alam, A S M Rubayet Ul; Islam, Israt; Hoque, M Nazmul; Akter, Salma; Rahaman, Md Mizanur; Sultana, Munawar; Hossain, M Anwar",J. med. virol,72,25

Research on chasing has focused mainly on adults, whereas the analysis of chasing behavior among adolescents has not received empirical attention in the gambling literature. The aim of the present study was to first investigate the interplay between chasing behavior, craving, temporal perspective, alcohol use, and gambling severity among Italian adolescents. Three hundred and sixty-four adolescents took part in the study. Participants completed the South Oaks Gambling Screen Revised for Adolescents (SOGS-RA), the Gambling Craving Scale (GACS), the 14-item Consideration of Future Consequences scale (CFC-14), the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), and performed a computerized task assessing chasing behavior. Participants were randomly assigned to the control and the loss condition of the computerized task. Results indicated that the choice to continue playing, as well as chasing frequency did not vary as a function of experimental condition. Hierarchical logistic and linear regression analyses revealed that the decision to chase depended mostly on craving, whereas chasing propensity was affected by craving and alcohol misuse. Notably, gambling severity did not predict either the decision to chase, or the chasing persistence. The present study contributes important findings to the gambling literature, highlighting the role of craving alcohol use in facilitating the inability to stop within-sessions gambling among adolescents. These findings may provide evidence that nonchasers and chasers represent two different types of gamblers, and that the difference may be useful for targeting more effective therapies.","Cosenza, Marina; Matarazzo, Olimpia; Ciccarelli, Maria; Nigro, Giovanna",Addict Behav,72,26

In order to tackle the devastating condition of the virus, countries need to attack the virus with aggressive and targeted tactics. Thus, to strengthen the COVID-19 mitigation measures and to give rapid response, there is an urgent need to understand the public's knowledge and attitude about of the pandemic at this critical moment. OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to assess the knowledge and attitude of communities about COVID-19 and associated factors among Gondar City residents. METHODS: A community based cross-sectional study was done among 623 respondents in Gondar city from April 20-27/2020. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire adapted from different literatures. The data were entered using Epi data version 3.1 and then exported into STATA version 14 for analysis. Bi-variable and multivariable binary logistic regression were performed. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI was used to declare statistically significant variables on the basis of p value less than 0.05 in the multivariable binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: The overall knowledge and attitude of the community towards COVID19 was 51.85% [95% CI (47.91%-55.78%)] and 53.13% [95% CI (49.20, 57.06%)], respectively.

SEARCH STRATEGY: Medline, EMBASE, DH-DATA and AMED databases were searched from inception to June 2019 using terms relevant to stillbirth, perinatal mortality and prediction models. The search was compliant with PRISMA guidelines. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies developing and/or validating prediction models for risk of stillbirth developed for application during pregnancy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Study screening and data extraction were conducted in duplicate, using the CHARMS checklist. Risk of bias was appraised using the PROBAST tool. RESULTS: The search identified 2751 citations. Fourteen studies reporting development of 69 models were included. Variables consistently included were: ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), uterine artery Doppler, pregnancy-associated plasma protein (PAPP-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF). Almost all models had significant concern about risk of bias. Apparent model performance (i.e. in the development dataset) was highest in models developed for use later in pregnancy and including maternal characteristics, and ultrasound and biochemical variables, but few were internally validated and none were externally validated. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all models identified were at high risk of bias. There are first trimester models of possible clinical benefit in early risk stratification; these require validation and clinical evaluation. There were few later pregnancy models, but if validated, these could be most relevant to individualised discussions around timing of birth.","Townsend, R; Manji, A; Allotey, J; Heazell, Aep; Jorgensen, L; Magee, L A; Mol, B W; Snell, Kie; Riley, R D; Sandall, J; Smith, Gcs; Patel, M; Thilaganathan, B; von Dadelszen, P; Thangaratinam, S; Khalil, A",BJOG,72,1

On the other hand, the endothelium may be disordered for other reasons, e.g., due to infection, such as COVID-19. The understanding of the role and significance of the endothelium in the body has changed significantly over time-from a simple physical barrier to a complex system encompassing local and systemic regulation of numerous processes in the body. Endothelium disorders may arise from impairment of one or more signaling pathways affecting dilator or constrictor activity, including nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate activation, prostacyclin-cyclic adenosine monophosphate activation, phosphodiesterase inhibition, and potassium channel activation or intracellular calcium level inhibition. In this review, plants are summarized as sources of biologically active substances affecting the endothelium.

To support a guideline on COVID-19 management, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 and other severe respiratory viral infections. METHODS: In March 2020, we searched international and Chinese biomedical literature databases, clinical trial registries and prepublication sources for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized studies comparing patients receiving and not receiving convalescent plasma. We included patients with acute coronavirus, influenza and Ebola virus infections. We conducted a meta-analysis using random-effects models and assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS: Of 1099 unique records, 6 studies were eligible, and none of these included patients with COVID-19. One nonrandomized study (n = 40) on convalescent plasma in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) provided uninformative results regarding mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] CI 0.01 to 1.70). Pooled estimates from 4 RCTs on influenza (n = 572) showed no convincing effects on deaths (4 RCTs, RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.81), complete recovery (2 RCTs, odds ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.64) or length of stay (3 RCTs, mean difference -1.62, 95% CI -3.82 to 0.58, d). The quality of evidence was very low for all efficacy outcomes. Convalescent plasma caused few or no serious adverse events in influenza RCTs (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.29, low-quality evidence). INTERPRETATION: Studies of non-COVID-19 severe respiratory viral infections provide indirect, very low-quality evidence that raises the possibility that convalescent plasma has minimal or no benefit in the treatment of COVID-19 and low-quality evidence that it does not cause serious adverse events.","Devasenapathy, Niveditha; Ye, Zhikang; Loeb, Mark; Fang, Fang; Najafabadi, Borna Tadayon; Xiao, Yingqi; Couban, Rachel; Bégin, Philippe; Guyatt, Gordon",CMAJ,72,16

Currently, a large amount of primary data have been generated from several preclinical studies. At least 300 clinical trials are underway for drug repurposing against COVID-19; the clinician needs objective evidence-based medication to treat COVID-19. OBSERVATIONS: Single-stranded RNA viral genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes structural proteins (spike protein), non-structural enzymatic proteins (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, papain-like protease, 3-chymotrypsin-like protease), and other accessory proteins. These four enzymatic proteins on spike protein are rate-limiting steps in viral replications and, therefore, an attractive target for drug development against SARS-CoV-2. In silico and in vitro studies have identified various potential epitomes as candidate sequences for vaccine development. These studies have also revealed potential targets for drug development and drug repurposing against COVID-19. Clinical trials utilizing antiviral drugs and other drugs have given inconclusive results regarding their clinical efficacy and side effects. The need of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-2) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and corticosteroids has been recommended. Western countries have adopted telemedicine as an alternative to prevent transmission of infection in the population. Currently, no proven, evidence-based therapeutic regimen exists for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has put tremendous pressure on researchers to evaluate and approve drugs effective against the disease. Well-controlled randomized trials should assess medicines that are not marketed with substantial evidence of safety and efficacy and more emphasis on time tested approaches for drug evaluation.","Shah, Naveed Nazir; Nabi, Showkat Ul; Bashir, Showkeen Muzamil; Rather, Muzafar Ahmad; Kalwar, Qudratullah; Ali, Sofi Imtiyaz; Sheikh, Wajid Mohammad; Ganai, Alveena",Basic clin. pharmacol. toxicol,72,3

We used national specialty guidance and an adapted screening tool to risk stratify patients identified from our prescribing and monitoring databases, and identify those needing to shield (score &#8805; 3) using information from departmental letters, online general practice records and recent laboratory investigations. We collated underlying rheumatological conditions and risk factors. Two months into the shielding process, we examined the COVID-19 status of these patients using hospital laboratory records and compared to population level data. Of 887 patients assessed, 248 (28%) scored &#8805; 3 and were sent a standard shielding letter. The most common risk factor in the shielding letter group was age &#8805; 70 years and/or presence of a listed co-morbidity (199 patients). The most common rheumatology conditions were rheumatoid arthritis (69.4%), polymyalgia rheumatica (8.5%) and giant cell arteritis (8.5%).

However, we found a trend towards lower incidence (0.113%) in our whole cohort (RR 0.28, 95%CI 0.04-2.01 for the whole cohort compared to UK population). The trend towards lower incidence in this cohort could be because of prior education regarding general infection risk and response to public health messages.

The Delta (B.1.617.2) variation, first seen in India, dominates COVID-19 infections in several large countries including the United States and India. Most recently, the Lambda variant of interest with increased resistance to vaccines has spread through much of South America. Objective: This research explores the degree to which new variants of concern 1) generate spikes and waves of fluctuations in the daily case fatality rates (CFR) across countries in several regions in the face of increasing levels of vaccination of national populations and 2) may increase the vulnerability of persons with certain comorbidities. Methods: This study uses new, openly available, epidemiological statistics reported to the relevant national and international authorities for countries across the Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Daily CFRs and correlations of fatal COVID-19 infections with potential cofactors are computed for the first half of 2021 that has been dominated by the wide spread of several variants of concern as denoted by the World Health Organization. Results: The analysis yields a new quantitative measure of the temporal dynamics of mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infections in the form of variations of a proxy case fatality rate compared on a country to-country basis in the same region. It also finds minimal variation of correlation between the cofactors based on WHO data and on the average apparent case fatality rate.","Barletta, William A.",,72,13

Tropical countries will face complex epidemiological scenarios involving the simultaneous transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with viruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti. The occurrence of arboviral diseases with COVID-19 in the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region presents challenges and opportunities for strengthening health services, surveillance and control programs. Financing of training, equipment and reconversion of hospital spaces will have a negative effect on already the limited resource directed to the health sector. The strengthening of the diagnostic infrastructure reappears as an opportunity for the national reference laboratories. Sharing of epidemiological information for the modeling of epidemiological scenarios allows collaboration between health, academic and scientific institutions. The fear of contagion by COVID-19 is constraining people with arboviral diseases to search for care which can lead to an increase in serious cases and could disrupt the operation of vector-control programs due to the reluctance of residents to open their doors to health personnel. Promoting intense community participation along with the incorporation of long lasting innovations in vector control offers new opportunities for control. The COVID-19 pandemic offers challenges and opportunities that must provoke positive behavioral changes and encourage more permanent self-care actions.","Dantés, Héctor Gómez; Manrique-Saide, Pablo; Vazquez-Prokopec, Gonzalo; Morales, Fabian Correa; Siqueira Junior, João Bosco; Pimenta, Fabiano; Coelho, Giovanini; Bezerra, Haroldo",Mem.

We aimed to further clarify the clinical characteristics of diabetes with COVID-19. Methods: Twenty-eight patients with diabetes and COVID-19 were enrolled from January 29, 2020, to February 10, 2020, with a final follow-up on February 22, 2020. Epidemiologic, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were analyzed. Results: The average age of the 28 patients was 68.6 ± 9.0 years. Most (75%) patients were male. Only 39.3% of the patients had a clear exposure of COVID-19. Fever (92.9%), dry cough (82.1%), and fatigue (64.3%) were the most common symptoms, followed by dyspnea (57.1%), anorexia (57.1%), diarrhea (42.9%), expectoration (25.0%), and nausea (21.4%). Fourteen patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The hemoglobin A1c level was similar between ICU and non-ICU patients. ICU patients had a higher respiratory rate, higher levels of random blood glucose, aspartate transaminase, bilirubin, creatine, N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide, troponin I, D-dimers, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, ferritin, interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, and IL-8 than non-ICU patients. Eleven of 14 ICU patients received noninvasive ventilation and 7 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation. Twelve patients died in the ICU group and no patients died in the non-ICU group.

Despite this, Italy has suffered a huge human and social cost, especially in Lombardy. The aim of this paper is dual: i) first, to investigate the reasons of the case fatality rate (CFR) differences across Italian 20 regions and 107 provinces, using a multivariate OLS regression approach; and ii) second, to build a taxonomy of provinces with similar mortality risk of COVID-19, by using the Ward hierarchical agglomerative clustering method. I considered health system metrics, environmental pollution, climatic conditions, demographic variables, and three ad hoc indexes that represent the health system saturation. The results showed that overall health care efficiency, physician density, and average temperature helped to reduce the CFR. By the contrary, population aged 70 and above, car and firm density, level of air pollutants (NO2, O3, PM10, and PM2.5), relative average humidity, COVID-19 prevalence, and all three indexes of health system saturation were positively associated with the CFR. Population density, social vertical integration, and altitude were not statistically significant. In particular, the risk of dying increases with age, as 90 years old and above had a three-fold greater risk than the 80 to 89 years old and four-fold greater risk than 70 to 79 years old. Moreover, the cluster analysis showed that the highest mortality risk was concentrated in the north of the country, while the lowest risk was associated with southern provinces. Finally, since prevalence and health system saturation indexes played the most important role in explaining the CFR variability, a significant part of the latter may have been caused by the massive stress of the Italian health system.","Perone, Gaetano",,72,16

Although numerous pharmacologic therapies to improve clinical outcomes in CARDS have been studied also in clinical trials, none have shown efficacy and there is great uncertainty about their effectiveness. There is still no recommendation for the therapeutic use of any specific agent to treat CARDS because no drugs are validated to have significant efficacy in clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients in large-scale trials.

Additionally, there are no standardized methods to detect Acinetobacter species colonization. METHODS: An outbreak of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) was identified at a Utah ventilator unit in a skilled nursing facility. An investigation was conducted to identify transmission modes in order to control spread of CRAB. Culture-based methods were used to identify patient colonization and environmental contamination in the facility. RESULTS: Of the 47 patients screened, OXA-23-producing CRAB were detected in 10 patients (21%), with 7 patients (15%) having been transferred from out-of-state facilities. Of patients who screened positive, 60% did not exhibit any signs or symptoms of active infection by chart review. A total of 38 environmental samples were collected and CRAB was recovered from 37% of those samples. Whole genome sequencing analyses of patient and environmental isolates suggested repeated CRAB introduction into the facility and highlighted the role of shared equipment in transmission. CONCLUSIONS: The investigation demonstrated this ventilated skilled nursing facility was an important reservoir for CRAB in the community and highlights the need for improved surveillance, strengthened infection control and inter-facility communication within and across states.","Smith, Amanda R; Vowles, Maureen; Horth, Roberta Z; Smith, Lori; Rider, Linda; Wagner, Jennifer M; Sangster, Anna; Young, Erin L; Schuckel, Hailey; Stewart, James; Gruninger, Randon J; Rossi, Alessandro; Oakeson, Kelly F; Nakashima, Allyn K",Am J Infect Control,72,1

The effect of delaying biopsies of suspicious prostate mpMRI lesions is uncertain and clinically relevant during the COVID-19 crisis. We evaluated the association between biopsy delay time and pathologic findings on subsequent prostate biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After obtaining IRB approval we reviewed the medical records of 214 patients who underwent image-guided transperineal fusion biopsy of the prostate biopsy between 2017 and 2019. Study outcomes included clinically significant (ISUP grade group &#8805;2) and any prostate cancer on biopsy. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between biopsy delay time and outcomes while adjusting for known predictors of cancer on biopsy. RESULTS: The study cohort included 195 men with a median age of 68. Median delay between mpMRI and biopsy was 5 months, and 90% of patients had a &#8804;8 months delay. A significant association was found between PI-RADS 5 lesions and no previous biopsies and shorter delay time. Delay time was not associated with clinically significant or any cancer on biopsy. A higher risk of significant cancer was associated with older age (Pâ¯=â¯0.008), higher PSA (0.003), smaller prostate volume (<0.001), no previous biopsy (0.012) and PI-RADS 5 lesions (0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that under current practice, where men with PI-RADS 5 lesions and no previous biopsies undergo earlier evaluation, a delay of up to 8 months between imaging and biopsy does not affect biopsy findings. In the current COVID-19 crisis, selectively delaying image-guided prostate biopsies is unlikely to result in a higher rate of significant cancer.","Savin, Ziv; Dekalo, Snir; Marom, Ron; Barnes, Sophie; Gitstein, Gilad; Mabjeesh, Nicola J; Matzkin, Haim; Yossepowitch, Ofer; Keren-Paz, Gal; Mano, Roy",Urol. oncol,72,24

Access to medical consultation became a challenge; hospitals were flooded with cases beyond their capacity and transport was halted due to lockdown. Global Health Directorate of The Indus Health Network supported the provincial government by rolling out several walk-in community-based testing initiatives across Karachi. Results were conveyed to the patients through each district government. With a disproportionate rise in cases, an increasing delay in reporting results was observed. Methods: To help the district government bridge this gap, two physicians were engaged to convey timely results to patients who tested positive, through a helpline. Subsequently, proactive teleconsultation was initiated. We present a retrospective review of data collected during teleconsultation for COVID-19 cases identified through community-based testing between April 5 and June 10, 2020. Results: A total of 4,279 tests were conducted, revealing a 28% positivity rate (1,196 cases). Out of these, 752 (62.9%) baseline positive patients were contactable. Most patients identified either a close contact (46.8%) or a household contact (30.1%) as the source of infection. 41.8% patients were asymptomatic, 52.9% had mild to moderate illness, and 1.1% needed referral to the emergency department. 82.7% patients reported no comorbidities. Conclusion: The rapid surge of cases could not be handled by a small team and an institutional strategy of integration into an existing call center service was adopted.

One solution, Bluetooth-enabled digital proximity tracing using smartphones, promises to preserve individual privacy while helping to contain society-wide viral outbreaks. However, this digital solution works effectively only if adopted by the majority of the population. This poses a collective action problem: everyone would benefit from wide-spread proximity tracing, but the benefits for the individual are indirect and limited. To facilitate such collective action at the societal level, this paper conceptualises the option space of IT governance actions for proximity tracing adoption along two dimensions: decision-making entities (who will govern the roll-out) and accountability enforcement (how strictly will adoption and use be enforced). Examining coherent governance approaches that arise from the framework, we show that there are no globally ideal approaches but only locally contextualised ones that depend on immediate health risk, prior experience with pandemics, societal values and national culture, role of government, trust in government and trust in technology in each society. The paper contributes specific propositions for governing digital contact tracing in the COVID-19 pandemic and general theoretical implications for IT governance for collective action at the societal level.","Riemer, Kai; Ciriello, Raffaele; Peter, Sandra; Schlagwein, Daniel",Eur.

In this paper, we examine how adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with experiencing greater perceived distress during the pandemic. In this volunteer clinical cohort study, 177 pregnant women (ages 16-38) were recruited from two university-affiliated perinatal clinics located in a small metropolitan city between October 2017 and May 2018. Longitudinal data collection is ongoing. The current study includes the 101 women who participated through the eighth and most recent survey conducted in mid-April 2020. OLS regression analyses were used to examine the association between childhood adversity and pandemic-related distress. We found that ACE scores were associated with higher levels of distress (b = .08; se = .03; p < .01) when controlling for demographic characteristics. The addition of loneliness to the model fully mediates the association between ACEs score and distress. Findings suggest that adverse childhood experiences influence COVID-19-related distress due to greater social isolation. Those who had greater adversity during childhood may be less likely to have the social connectedness needed to reduce distress due to the pandemic.","Shreffler, Karina M; Joachims, Christine N; Tiemeyer, Stacy; Simmons, W Kyle; Teague, T Kent; Hays-Grudo, Jennifer",Advers Resil Sci,72,16

With the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China in December 2019, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has been attracting tremendous attention. Rapid and accurate laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for early discovery, early reporting, early quarantine, early treatment, and cutting off epidemic transmission. The genome structure, transmission, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 are basically similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the other two beta-CoVs of medical importance. During the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, a variety of molecular and serological diagnostic assays were established and should be referred to for SARS-CoV-2. In this review, by summarizing the articles and guidelines about specimen collection, nucleic acid tests (NAT) and serological tests for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, several suggestions are put forward to improve the laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2. In summary, for NAT: collecting stool and blood samples at later periods of illness to improve the positive rate if lower respiratory tract specimens are unavailable; increasing template volume to raise the sensitivity of detection; putting samples in reagents containing guanidine salt to inactivate virus as well as protect RNA; setting proper positive, negative and inhibition controls to ensure high-quality results; simultaneously amplifying human RNase P gene to avoid false-negative results. For antibody test, diverse assays targeting different antigens, and collecting paired samples are needed.","Yan, Ying; Chang, Le; Wang, Lunan",Rev Med Virol,72,27

In addition, the aging world population inevitably leads to higher demand for better artificial organ (AO) devices. Membrane technology is the central component in many of the AO devices including lung, kidney, liver and pancreas. Although AO technology has improved significantly in the past few decades, the quality of life of organ failure patients is still poor and the technology must be improved further. Most of the current AO literature focuses on the treatment and the clinical use of AO, while the research on the membrane development aspect of AO is relatively scarce. One of the speculated reasons is the wide interdisciplinary spectrum of AO technology, ranging from biotechnology to polymer chemistry and process engineering. In this review, in order to facilitate the membrane aspects of the AO research, the roles of membrane technology in the AO devices, along with the current challenges, are summarized. This review shows that there is a clear need for better membranes in terms of biocompatibility, permselectivity, module design, and process configuration.","Duy Nguyen, Bao Tran; Nguyen Thi, Hai Yen; Nguyen Thi, Bich Phuong; Kang, Dong-Ku; Kim, Jeong F",,72,20

METHODS: Cake flour (aerosol model) was expelled from an advanced life support training mannequin. The primary outcome measure was the number of 0.3–10 µm-sized particles at three locations corresponding to the physician, medical staff, and environmental aerosol exposure levels. The aerosol dispersion was visualized using a high-resolution video. The number of expelled particles was measured after artificial coughing during simulated tracheal intubation and extubation in four situations, with or without an aerosol box in a pressurized or depressurized room (≤ 2.5 Pa). RESULTS: The particles arising from tracheal intubation at the three positions in the four groups differed significantly in size (p < 0.05). The sizes of particles arising from extubation at the physicians’ and medical staff’s faces in the four groups differed significantly in size (p < 0.05). Post hoc analysis showed that the counts of all particles at the three positions were significantly lower in the depressurized room with an aerosol box than in the pressurized room without an aerosol box during tracheal intubation (p < 0.05 at three positions) and extubation (p < 0.05) at the physician’s and medical staff’s positions). Visual assessments supported these results. CONCLUSION: The aerosol box decreased the exposure of the aerosol to the physician, medical staff, and environment during aerosol-generating procedures in the depressurized room only.

A subsequent national review made seven recommendations to improve vaccine pharmacovigilance. Ten years on, in advance of implementing the COVID-19 immunisation program, we evaluated views on the capacity of Australia’s vaccine pharmacovigilance system to promptly detect, examine and communicate a signal. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted between July and October 2020 with individuals with expertise in vaccine safety in Australia using an interview guide informed by key Australian and international frameworks. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was used to code data using a deductive approach. RESULTS: Interviews with seventeen participants enabled six themes to be identified. Participants described improvement and significant innovation within Australia’s vaccine pharmacovigilance system over the decade since 2010, particularly through establishment of a new active, cohort event monitoring system using short message service surveys. Participants thought Australia had a good foundation for COVID-19 vaccine safety surveillance; implementation of the COVID-19 immunisation program was seen as a potential driver for ongoing enhancement through: a) improved integration of the active surveillance and spontaneous reporting systems, and; b) development of population-level active surveillance, including through data linkage. Transparent communication was considered essential to address the unprecedented challenges of COVID-19 and broader vaccine safety concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine safety experts in Australia convey confidence in the innovative pharmacovigilance systems implemented over the past 10 years. While Australia has a multifaceted system incorporating both active surveillance and spontaneous reporting systems, COVID-19 vaccine implementation represents an opportunity to enhance current systems and to develop new, systematic approaches to vaccine pharmacovigilance that should make both a local and global contribution.","Phillips, Anastasia; Carlson, Samantha; Danchin, Margie; Beard, Frank; Macartney, Kristine",Vaccine,72,24

We modelled how vaccination through the UK’s vaccine priority groups impacts deaths, hospital and ICU admissions from COVID‐19. We used the UK COVID‐19 vaccines delivery plan and publicly available data to estimate UK population by age group and vaccination priority group, including frontline health and social care workers and individuals deemed ‘extreme clinical vulnerable’ or ‘high risk’. Using published data on numbers and distributions of COVID‐19‐related hospital and ICU admissions and deaths, we modelled the impact of vaccination by age group. We then modified the model to account for hospital and ICU admission, and death among health and social care workers and the population with extreme clinical vulnerability and high risk. Our model closely matches the government’s estimates for mortality after vaccination of priority groups 1–4 and groups 1–9. The model shows vaccination will have a much slower impact on hospital and ICU admissions than on deaths. The early prioritisation of healthcare staff and clinically vulnerable patients increases the impact of vaccination on admissions and also protects the healthcare service. An inflection point, when 50% of the adult population has been vaccinated – with deaths reduced by 95% and hospital admissions by 80% – may be a useful point for re‐evaluating vaccine prioritisation. Our model suggests substantial reductions in hospital and ICU admissions will not occur until late March and into April 2021.","Cook, T. M.; Roberts, J. V.",Anaesthesia,72,20

The present study sought to understand parents’ hesitancy and concerns around accessing healthcare during the pandemic using a cross-sectional survey of parents of children under the age of 16 (N = 1044) in Ireland. Multinomial and logistic regression analyses were used to determine the factors that influenced avoidance and hesitancy. In total, 34% of participants stated that their child required healthcare during the pandemic, of whom 22% decided against seeking healthcare. Parents who reported being much more hesitant about accessing healthcare were more likely to report mild–moderate (Relative Risk Ratio (RRR) = 2.31, CI: 1.54–3.47) and severe–extremely severe stress (RRR: 3.37, CI: 1.81–6.27). Parents who understood government advice to mean avoiding health services were more likely to be hesitant to attend (RRR: 1.71, CI; 1.10–2.67). These effects held when restrictions were beginning to be lifted. Higher levels of stress were associated with a parent believing that the government advice meant that they should not attend health services (OR: 1.66, CI: 1.14–2.41).

Of equal and ongoing importance is elucidating the impact of mitigation measures, such as lockdown, on the well-being of societies. Research about mental health and lockdown in the UK has predominately involved large surveys that are likely to encounter self-selection bias. Further, self-reporting does not constitute a clinical judgement. AIMS: To (a) compare the age, gender and ethnicity of patients experiencing mental health emergencies prior compared with during lockdown, (b) determine whether the nature of mental health emergencies has changed during compared with before lockdown, (c) explore the utility of emergency medical service data for identifying vulnerability to mental health emergencies in real time during a pandemic. METHOD: A total of 32 401 clinical records of ambulance paramedics attending mental health emergencies in the East Midlands of the UK between 23 March and 31 July 2020 and the same period in 2019 were analysed using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: People of younger age, male gender and South Asian and Black ethnicity are particularly vulnerable to acute mental health conditions during lockdown. Patients with acute cases of anxiety have increased during lockdown whereas suicide and intentional drug overdose have decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported data may underrepresent the true impact of lockdown on male mental health and ethnic minority groups. Emergency medical data can be used to identify vulnerable communities in the context of the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the current pandemic, as well as under more ordinary circumstances.","Moore, Harriet Elizabeth; Siriwardena, Aloysius Niroshan; Gussy, Mark; Tanser, Frank; Hill, Bartholomew; Spaight, Robert",BJPsych Open,72,30

Calculated free testosterone (FTe) and bioavailable testosterone (BavTe) may reflect more accurately this hormone's levels. In this study, we sought to assess TTe, FTe as well as BavTe in male patients with COVID-19. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Sera were collected upon admission from 65 men (10 in the intensive care units [ICU] and 55 in the wards) with polymerase chain reaction - proven COVID-19. A group of age-matched COVID-19-negative men (n=29) hospitalized in general medical wards served as controls. Age, body mass index (BMI) and 28-day mortality were noted. Measurements included TTe, sex-hormone binding globulin, albumin (the latter two for calculating FTe and BavTe) and laboratory markers of inflammation (white blood cell count [WBC], D-Dimers [D-D], lactate dehydrogenease [LDH], ferritin [Fer] and C-reactive protein [CRP]). RESULTS: Profoundly low TTe, FTe and BavTe were noted in most patients, and were associated with disease severity/outcome (being the lowest in COVID-19 patients in the ICU and overall being lower in non-survivors; analysis of covariance p<0.05).

Hence, even suspected HID cases should be managed in specialised facilities minimizing infection risks but allowing state-of-the-art critical care. Consensus statements on the operational management of isolation facilities have been published recently. The study presented was set up to compare the operational management, resources, and technical equipment among European isolation facilities. Due to differences in geography, population density, and national response plans it was hypothesized that adherence to recommendations will vary. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Until mid of 2010 the European Network for Highly Infectious Diseases conducted a cross-sectional analysis of isolation facilities in Europe, recruiting 48 isolation facilities in 16 countries. Three checklists were disseminated, assessing 44 items and 148 specific questions. The median feedback rate for specific questions was 97.9% (n = 47/48) (range: n = 7/48 (14.6%) to n = 48/48 (100%). Although all facilities enrolled were nominated specialised facilities' serving countries or regions, their design, equipment and personnel management varied. Eighteen facilities fulfilled the definition of a High Level Isolation Unit'. In contrast, 24 facilities could not operate independently from their co-located hospital, and five could not ensure access to equipment essential for infection control. Data presented are not representative for the EU in general, as only 16/27 (59.3%) of all Member States agreed to participate. Another limitation of this study is the time elapsed between data collection and publication; e.g. in Germany one additional facility opened in the meantime. CONCLUSION: There are disparities both within and between European countries regarding the design and equipment of isolation facilities. With regard to the International Health Regulations, terminology, capacities and equipment should be standardised.","Schilling, Stefan; Fusco, Francesco Maria; De Iaco, Giuseppina; Bannister, Barbara; Maltezou, Helena C.; Carson, Gail; Gottschalk, Rene; Brodt, Hans-Reinhard; Brouqui, Philippe; Puro, Vincenzo; Ippolito, Giuseppe",PLoS One,72,10

Here we report that COVID-19-induced oxidative stress inflicts structural damages to HSA and is linked with mortality outcome in critically ill patients. We recruited 25 patients who were followed up for a median of 12.5 days (1-35 days), among them 14 had died. Analyzing blood samples from patients and healthy individuals (n=10), we provide evidence that neutrophils are major sources of oxidative stress in blood and that hydrogen peroxide is highly accumulated in plasmas of non-survivors. We then analyzed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of spin labelled fatty acids (SLFA) bound with HSA in whole blood of control, survivor, and non-survivor subjects (n=10-11). Non-survivors HSA showed dramatically reduced protein packing order parameter, faster SLFA correlational rotational time, and greater S/W ratio (strong-binding/weak-binding sites within HSA), all reflecting remarkably fluid protein microenvironments. Stratified at the means, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that lower values of S/W ratio and accumulated H2O2 in plasma significantly predicted in-hospital mortality (S/W<0.16, 80% (9/12) vs. S/W>0.16, 20% (2/10), p=0.008; plasma [H2O2]>7.1 M, 83.3% (5/6) vs. 16.7% (1/6), p=0.049). When we combined these two parameters as the ratio ((S/W)/[H2O2]) to derive a risk score, the resultant risk score lower than the mean (< 0.0253) predicted mortality with 100% accuracy (100% (6/6) vs. 0% (0/6), logrank {chi}2 = 12.01, p = 5x10-4).

The virus, which first appeared as a sign of pneumonia, was later called the SARS-COV-2 with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome by the World Health Organization. The SARS-COV-2 virus is triggered by binding to the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE 2) inhibitor, which is vital in cardiovascular diseases and the immune system, especially in conditions such as cerebrovascular, hypertension, and diabetes. This study aims to evaluate the prediction performance of death status based on the demographic/clinical factors (including COVID-19 severity) by data mining methods. METHODS: The dataset consists of 1603 SARS-COV-2 patients and 13 variables obtained from an open-source web address. The current dataset contains age, gender, chronic disease (hypertension, diabetes, renal, cardiovascular, etc.), some enzymes (ACE, angiotensin II receptor blockers), and COVID-19 severity, which are used to predict death status using deep learning and machine learning approaches (random forest, k-nearest neighbor, extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost]). A grid search algorithm tunes hyperparameters of the models, and predictions are assessed through performance metrics. Steps of knowledge discovery in databases are applied to obtain the relevant information. RESULTS: The accuracy rate of deep learning (97.15%) was more successful than the accuracy rate based on classical machine learning (92.15% for RF and 93.4% for k-NN), but the ensemble classifier XGBoost method gave the highest accuracy (99.7%). While COVID-19 severity and age calculated from XGBoost were the two most important factors associated with death status, the most determining variables for death status estimated from deep learning were COVID-19 severity and hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model (XGBoost) achieved the best prediction of death status based on the factors as compared to the other algorithms. The results of this study can guide patients with certain variables to take early measures and access preventive health care services before they become infected with the virus.","Kivrak, Mehmet; Guldogan, Emek; Colak, Cemil",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,72,21

The most prominent pollutant concerning air quality index (AQI) was determined by Pearson’s correlation analysis and unpaired Welch’s two-sample t test was carried out to measure the statistically significant reduction in average AQI for all the four sites. AQI significantly plummeted by 44%, 59%, 59%, and 6% in ITO-Delhi, Worli-Mumbai, Jadavpur-Kolkata, and Manali Village-Chennai respectively. The findings conclude a significant improvement in air quality with respect to reduction of 49–73%, 17–63%, 30–74%, and 15–58% in the mean concentration of PM2.5, PM10, NH(3), and SO(2) respectively during the confinement for the studied locations. The p values for all of the four studied locations were found significantly less than the 5% level of significance for Welch’s t test analysis. In addition, reduced AQI values were highly correlated with prominent pollutants (PM2.5 and PM10) during Pearson’s correlation analysis.

It is argued that developing more sensitive, easy to administer, and valid MCI screening tools for use in primary care settings may initiate timely clinical and personal care planning and treatment, enabling early access to programs and services. Including functional competence measures in screening tests makes them more ecologically valid and may help to identify cognitive deficits at an earlier stage. OBJECTIVE: We aim to conduct a preliminary evaluative study comparing the sensitivity, specificity, and reliability of the BrainFx Screen (referred to as SCREEN hereafter), a novel digital tool designed to assess functional competence and detect early signs of cognitive impairment, with the Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment, a validated and highly sensitive tool that detects MCI in the older adult population. We will also investigate the perceived usefulness and integration of the SCREEN into primary care practice to identify demonstrable impacts on clinical workflow and health care providers’ (HCP) perceptions of its success as a screening tool. Patients’ perceptions of completing the SCREEN and its impact on their quality of life will also be explored. METHODS: This study has a concurrent, mixed methods, prospective, and quasi-experimental design. Participants will be recruited from 5 primary care family health teams (FHTs; defined by multidisciplinary practice and capitated funding) across southwestern Ontario, Canada. Participants will include HCPs, patients, care partners, and FHT administrative executives. Patients 55 years and older with no history of diagnoses for MCI, dementia, or Alzheimer disease rostered in one of the FHTs participating in the study will be eligible to participate. Their care partners will help triangulate the qualitative data collected from patients. Participating FHTs will identify an occupational therapist from their site to participate in the study; this HCP will both administer the research protocol and participate in semistructured in-depth interviews and questionnaires. Principal component analysis will be conducted on the SCREEN data to understand the test components better. Tests comparing sensitivity, specificity, and test-retest reliability will assess the validity of SCREEN as a screening tool for MCI.

Data collection was halted early because of COVID-19 restrictions on research activity, and data analysis is currently in progress. CONCLUSIONS: At the end of the project, we anticipate having an initial comparative evaluation of the SCREEN as a tool for early detection of MCI in primary care older adult patient populations. Resource constraints on this research study limit our ability to conduct a randomized controlled trial; however, the results will assist developers of the SCREEN in determining whether rigorous controlled testing is warranted.

Methods: An online survey of 8158 Chinese adults between 22 February to 5 March 2020 was conducted. Bivariate associations between categorical variables were examined using Fisher exact test. We also explored the determinants of four NPIs as well as their association with COVID19 infection using logistic regression. Results: Of 8158 adults included, 57 (0.73%) were infected with COVID19. The overwhelming majority of respondents showed a positive attitude (99.2%), positive risk perception (99.9%) and high knowledge levels that were among the strongest predictors of four highly adopted NPIs (hand washing:96.8%; proper coughing: 93.1%; social distancing:87.1%; mask wearing:97.9%). There was an increased risk of COVID19 infection for those who not washing hands (2.28% vs 0.65%; RR=3.53: 95%CI: 1.538.15; P<0.009); not practicing proper coughing (1.79% vs 0.73%; RR=2.44: 95%CI: 1.15-5.15;P=0.026); not practicing social distancing (1.52% vs 0.58%; RR=2.63:95%CI:1.48 4.67; P=0.002); and not wearing a mask (7.41% vs 0.6%; RR=12.38:95%CI:5.81-26.36; P<0.001). For those who did practice all other three NPIs, wearing mask was associated with significantly reduced risk of infection compared to those who did not wear a mask (0.6% vs 16.7%; p=0.035). Similarly, for those who did not practice all or part of the other three NPIs, wearing mask was also associated with significantly reduced risk of infection. In a penalised logistic regression model including all four NPIs, wearing a mask was the only significant predictor of COVID19 infection among four NPIs (OR=7.20; 95%CI:2.2423.11; p<0.001). Conclusions: We found high levels of risk perception, positive attitude, desirable knowledge as well as a high level of adopting four NPIs. The relevant knowledge, risk perception and attitude were strong predictors of adapting the four NPIs. Mask wearing, among four personal NPIs, is the most effective protective measure against COVID19 infection with added preventive effect among those who practised all or part of the other three NPIs.","Xu, H.; Gan, Y.; Zheng, D.; Wu, B.; Zhu, X.; Xu, C.; Liu, C.; Tao, Z.; Hu, Y.; Chen, M.; Li, M.; Lu, Z.; Chen, J.",,72,4

However, there are still many limitations, especially the problem of the high false negative rate. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 NAT and evaluate the diagnostic performance of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody detection in novel coronavirus infection. METHODS: A total of 10309 suspected or high-risk cases of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan Hubei, China, were tested for virus NAT by RT-PCR. Among those cases, 762 COVID-19 patients and 143 patients with non-COVID-19 who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG during the NAT period were screened. The difference between the two test methods was analyzed using the chi-square test. RESULTS: The positive rate of 10309 cases was about 36% (95% CI: 33.39%-39.67%). SARS-CoV-2 was present in various types of specimens, and alveolar lavage fluid had the highest positive rate [52.38% (95% CI: 31.02-73.74)]. The clinical sensitivity of serum SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG was 77.17% (588/762) and 94.88% (723/762), respectively, and the clinical specificity was 93.71% (134/143) and 90.21% (129/143). The area under the curve (AUC) of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and combination of IgG with IgM were equally larger than IgM [0.973 (95% CI: 0.964-0.983) vs 0.930 (95% CI: 0.910-0.949)]. IgG antibody had the highest specificity [100.0% (95% CI: 100.00%-100.00%)] and sensitivity [94.0% (95% CI: 92.45%-95.55%)] when detected alone or in combination with IgM antibody. The total coincidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detection and SARS-CoV-2 NAT for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 92.04% (833/905). Among the 34 SARS-CoV-2 NAT-negative patients with clinical symptoms and CT imaging features, 29 (85.29%) patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM, and 31 (91.76%) were positive for IgG. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 NAT should be considered for many types of specimens, and the combined test of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG can make up for the problem of missed NAT in COVID-19 patients.","Chen, Juanjuan; Niu, Zhili; Li, Huan; Tang, Dongling; Zhang, Pingan",Arch Iran Med,72,17

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts issued guidance outlining the use of a reserve system with a lottery for allocation of mAbs in the event of scarcity that would prioritize socially vulnerable patients for 20% of the infusion slots. The Mass General Brigham (“MGB”) health system subsequently implemented such a reserve system. Research Question. Can a reserve system be successfully deployed in a large health system in a way that promotes equitable access to mAb therapy among socially vulnerable patients with Covid-19? Study Design and Methods We conducted a retrospective review of the operation of the reserve system for allocation of mAbs to identify how referrals moved through the allocation process, and what proportion of patients who were offered and received mAbs were socially vulnerable. Results Notwithstanding multiple operational challenges, the reserve system for allocation of mAb therapy worked as intended to enhance the number of socially vulnerable patients who were offered and received mAb therapy. A significantly higher proportion of patients offered mAb therapy were socially vulnerable (27.0%) than would have been the case if the infusion appointments had been allocated using a pure lottery system without a vulnerable reserve (19.8%) and a significantly higher proportion of patient who received infusions were socially vulnerable (25.3%) than would have been the case if the infusion appointments had been allocated using a pure lottery system (17.6%) Interpretation Our health system experience demonstrates that a reserve system with a lottery for tiebreaking is a viable way to distribute scarce therapeutics when enhancing access for certain groups is desirable.","Rubin, Emily; Dryden-Peterson, Scott L.; Hammond, Sarah P.; Lennes, Inga; Letourneau, Alyssa R.; Pathak, Parag; Sonmez, Tayfun; Ünver, M.

Since the introduction of metagenomics nearly a decade ago, numerous reports have described successful applications in an increasing variety of biological specimens, such as respiratory secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, stool, blood and tissue. Considerable advancements in sequencing and computational technologies in recent years have made CMg a promising tool in clinical microbiology laboratories. Moreover, costs per sample and turnaround time from specimen receipt to clinical management continue to decrease, making the prospect of CMg more feasible. Many difficulties, however, are associated with CMg and warrant further improvements such as the informatics infrastructure and analytical pipelines. Thus, the current review focuses on comprehensively assessing applications of CMg for diagnostic and subtyping purposes.","Forbes, Jessica D.; Knox, Natalie C.; Peterson, Christy-Lynn; Reimer, Aleisha R.",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,72,3

METHODS: An European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) task force formulated four research questions to be addressed by systematic literature review (SLR). The SLR results informed consensus statements. One overarching principle, 10 points to consider (PTC) and a research agenda were proposed. Task force members rated their level of agreement (1–10) for each PTC. RESULTS: Epidemiological and demographic characteristics should be measured in all clinical trials and studies in at-risk individuals. Different at-risk populations, identified according to clinical presentation, were defined: asymptomatic, musculoskeletal symptoms without arthritis and early clinical arthritis. Study end-points should include the development of subclinical inflammation on imaging, clinical arthritis, RA and subsequent achievement of arthritis remission. Risk factors should be assessed at baseline and re-evaluated where appropriate; they include genetic markers and autoantibody profiling and additionally clinical symptoms and subclinical inflammation on imaging in those with symptoms and/or clinical arthritis. Trials should address the effect of the intervention on risk factors, as well as progression to clinical arthritis or RA. In patients with early clinical arthritis, pharmacological intervention has the potential to prevent RA development. Participants’ knowledge of their RA risk may inform their decision to participate; information should be provided using an individually tailored approach.

METHODS: The study was conducted between September 2020 and April 2021 in a liver transplant institute affiliated with a university hospital. The sample of the study was 135 patients. Personal Information Form, Fear of Covid 19 Scale, and Questionnaire of Social Impact of COVID 19 Pandemic were used to collect data. RESULTS: It was determined that the Fear of Covid 19 Scale mean score of the patients was 21.25 ± 6.99. As the fear of COVID 19 increases in patients who had liver transplant, it was determined that their desire to be in crowded environments, to prefer public transportation, to go to the doctor for examination and their focusing on various objectives were decreasing. Also, fear of COVID 19 increased the difficulty in sleep, storage of food and cleaning materials, washing hands frequently, using masks and gloves when going out, health concerns, doubts about disease symptoms, orientation towards healthy eating, worries about the future and questioning the meaning of life.

In the second phase of the project, their stories were merged into a theater production, weaving movement, song, and voice, and performed by an ensemble of experienced actors from the community. Pre- and post-interviews and self-report standardized measures of executive functioning were used to assist in establishing criteria and direction for future research.

We present here an analysis of an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model that accounts for asymptomatic carriers, and explore the effect of different intervention strategies such as social distancing (SD) and testing-quarantining (TQ). The two intervention strategies (SD and TQ) try to reduce the disease reproductive number R0 to a target value R0target < 1, but in distinct ways, which we implement in our model equations. We find that for the same target R0target < 1, TQ is more efficient in controlling the pandemic than lockdowns that only implement SD. However, for TQ to be effective, it has to be based on contact tracing and the ratio of tests/day to the number of new cases/day has to be scaled with the mean number of contacts of an infectious person, which would be high in densely populated regions with low levels of SD. We point out that, apart from R0, an important quantity is the largest eigenvalue of the linearised dynamics which provides a more complete understanding of the disease progression, both pre- and post- intervention, and explains observed data for many countries. Weak intervention strategies (that reduce R0 but not to a value less than 1) can reduce the peak values of infections and the asymptotic affected population. We provide simple analytic expressions for these in terms of the disease parameters and apply them in the Indian context to obtain heuristic projections for the course of the pandemic. We find that the predictions strongly depend on the assumed fraction of asymptomatic carriers.","Das, A.; Dhar, A.; Kundu, A.; Goyal, S.",,72,1

Historically, this syndrome has been poorly understood and often overlooked. As a result, people living with EDS had difficulty obtaining an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment, leading to untold personal suffering as well as ineffective health care utilization. The GoodHope EDS clinic addresses systemic gaps in the diagnosis and treatment of EDS. This paper describes a leap forward—from lack of awareness, diagnosis, and treatment—to expert care that is tailored to meet the specific needs of patients with EDS. The GoodHope EDS clinic consists of experts from various medical specialties who work together to provide comprehensive care that addresses the multi-systemic nature of the syndrome. In addition, EDS-specific self-management programs have been developed that draw on exercise science, rehabilitation, and health psychology to improve physical and psychosocial wellbeing and overall quality of life. Embedded into the program are research initiatives to shed light on the clinical presentation, underlying mechanisms of pathophysiology, and syndrome management. We also lead regular educational activities for community health care providers to increase awareness and competence in the interprofessional management of EDS beyond our doors and throughout the province and country.","Mittal, Nimish; Mina, Daniel Santa; McGillis, Laura; Weinrib, Aliza; Slepian, P.

However, the role of PHI in understanding and managing pandemics, citizens’ role in this context, and which methods are relevant for collecting and processing data are still unclear, as is which types of data are relevant. This paper aims to clarify these issues and explore the role of PHI in managing and detecting pandemics. Methods : Through a literature review we identified studies that explore the role of PHI in detecting and managing pandemics. Studies from five databases were screened: PubMed, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), IEEE Xplore, ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Digital Library, and Cochrane Library. Data from studies fulfilling the eligibility criteria were extracted and synthesized narratively. Results : Out of 417 citations retrieved, 53 studies were included in this review. Most research focused on influenza-like illnesses or COVID-19 with at least three papers on other epidemics (Ebola, Zika or measles). The geographic scope ranged from global to concentrating on specific countries. Multiple processing and analysis methods were reported, although often missing relevant information. The majority of outcomes are reported for two application areas: crisis communication and detection of disease outbreaks. Conclusions : For most diseases, the small number of studies prevented reaching firm conclusions about the utility of PHI in detecting and monitoring these disease outbreaks. For others, e.g., COVID-19, social media and online search patterns corresponded to disease patterns, and detected disease outbreak earlier than conventional public health methods, thereby suggesting that PHI can contribute to disease and pandemic monitoring.","Gabarron, Elia; Rivera-Romero, Octavio; Miron-Shatz, Talya; Grainger, Rebecca; Denecke, Kerstin",Yearb Med Inform,72,32

Objective: This study aimed to assess the prevalence of pre-existing morbidities among COVID-19 infected patients and their mortality risks against each type of pre-existing morbidity categories. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis Data sources: Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL databases were searched using the following keywords: (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV or Coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2) AND (Comorbidity or Morbidity) AND (Mortality or Death or Died) up to May 01, 2020. Further searches were conducted using the reference list of the selected studies, renowned pre-print servers (e.g., medRxiv, bioRixv, SSRN), and relevant journal websites. Eligibility criteria: Studies written in the English language included if those were conducted among COVID-19 patients with and without comorbidities and presented survivor vs. non-survivor counts or hazard/odds of deaths or survivors against types of pre-existing morbidities. Methods: Comorbidities reported in the selected studies were grouped into eight categories. The pooled likelihoods of deaths in each category were estimated using a fixed or random-effect model, based on the heterogeneity assessment. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel plot asymmetry and Egger regression test. Trim and Fill method was used if there any publication bias was found. Results: A total of 42 studies included in this study comprised of 39,398 samples. The most common pre-existing morbidities in COVID-19 infected patients were hypertension (36.5%), cardiovascular disease (11.9%), and diabetes (22.0%). The higher likelihood of deaths was found among COVID-19 patients who had pre-existing cardiovascular system diseases (OR: 3.32, 95% CI: 2.79-3.95), immune and metabolic disorders (OR: 2.39, 95% CI: 2.00-2.85), respiratory diseases (OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.80-2.26), cerebrovascular system diseases (OR: 4.12, 95% CI: 3.04-5.58), any types of cancers (OR: 2.22, 95% CI: 1.63-3.03), renal (OR: 3.02, 95% CI: 2.60-3.52), and liver system diseases (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.21-1.71). Conclusions: This study provides evidence of a higher likelihood of deaths among COVID-19 patients against morbidity categories. These findings could potentially help healthcare providers to sort out the most endangered COVID-19 patients by comorbidities, take precautionary measures during hospitalization, assess susceptibility to death, and prioritize their treatment, which could potentially reduce the number of fatalities in COVID-19 disease.","Khan, M.; Khan, M.

There is increasing recognition of the value of metrics obtainable remotely. We compared the self‐reported SF‐36 physical functioning subscale score (SF‐36 PF) with in‐person physical performance tests (6‐min walk and sit‐to‐stand) in a prospective cohort of kidney transplant candidates. We assessed each metric's ability to predict time to the composite outcome of waitlist removal or death, censoring at transplant. We built time‐dependent receiver operating characteristic curves and calculated the area under the curve [AUC(t)] at 1 year, using bootstrapping for internal validation. In 199 patients followed for a median of 346 days, 41 reached the composite endpoint. Lower SF‐36 PF scores were associated with higher risk of waitlist removal/death, with every 10‐point decrease corresponding to a 16% increase in risk. All models showed an AUC(t) of 0.83–0.84 that did not contract substantially after internal validation. Among kidney transplant candidates, SF‐36 PF, obtainable remotely, can help to stratify the risk of waitlist removal or death, and may be used as a screening tool for poor physical functioning in ongoing candidate evaluation, particularly where travel, increasing patient volume, or other restrictions challenge in‐person assessment.","Watford, Daniel J.; Cheng, Xingxing S.; Han, Jialin; Stedman, Margaret R.; Chertow, Glenn M.; Tan, Jane C.",Clin Transplant,72,1

However, there is also inaccurate information that vaping can aid COVID-19 treatment, as well as expert opinion that CBD, possibly administered through vaping, can mitigate COVID-19 symptoms. Thus, it is necessary to study the spread of inaccurate information to better understand how to promote scientific knowledge and curb inaccurate information, which is critical to the health of vapers. Inaccurate information about vaping and COVID-19 may affect COVID-19 treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVE: Using structural topic modeling, we aimed to map temporal trends in the web-based vaping narrative (a large data set comprising web-based vaping chatter from several sources) to indicate how the narrative changed from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We obtained data using a textual query that scanned a data pool of approximately 200,000 different domains (4,027,172 documents and 361,100,284 words) such as public internet forums, blogs, and social media, from August 1, 2019, to April 21, 2020. We then used structural topic modeling to understand changes in word prevalence and semantic structures within topics around vaping before and after December 31, 2019, when COVID-19 was reported to the World Health Organization. RESULTS: Broadly, the web-based vaping narrative can be organized into the following groups or archetypes: harms from vaping; Vaping Regulation; Vaping as Harm Reduction or Treatment; and Vaping Lifestyle. Three archetypes were observed prior to the emergence of COVID-19; however, four archetypes were identified post–COVID-19 (Vaping as Harm Reduction or Treatment was the additional archetype). A topic related to CBD product preference emerged after COVID-19 was first reported, which may be related to the use of CBD by vapers as a COVID-19 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our main finding is the emergence of a vape-administered CBD treatment narrative around COVID-19 when comparing the web-based vaping narratives before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results are key to understanding how vapers respond to inaccurate information about COVID-19, optimizing treatment of vapers who contract COVID-19, and possibly minimizing instances of inaccurate information. The findings have implications for the management of COVID-19 among vapers and the monitoring of web-based content pertinent to tobacco to develop targeted interventions to manage COVID-19 among vapers.","Janmohamed, Kamila; Soale, Abdul-Nasah; Forastiere, Laura; Tang, Weiming; Sha, Yongjie; Demant, Jakob; Airoldi, Edoardo; Kumar, Navin",J Med Internet Res,72,3

Despite the lessons of history, the world is not yet ready to face the next great plague",13.364264,4.9275804,2007-05-18,"ABSTRACT Health care team training and simulation-based education are important for preparing obstetrical services to meet the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Priorities for training are identified in two key areas. First, the impact of infection prevention and control protocols on processes of care (e.g., appropriate and correct use of personal protective equipment, patient transport, preparation for emergency cesarean delivery with the potential for emergency intubation, management of simultaneous obstetric emergencies, delivery in alternate locations in the hospital, potential for increased decision-to-delivery intervals, and communication with patients). And second, the effects of COVID-19 pathophysiology on obstetrical patients (e.g., testing and diagnosis, best use of modified obstetric early warning systems, approach to maternal respiratory compromise, collaboration with critical care teams, and potential need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation). However, such training is more challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic because of the requirements for social distancing. This article outlines strategies (spatial, temporal, video-recording, video-conferencing, and virtual) to effectively engage in health care team training and simulation-based education while maintaining social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kiely, Daniel J.; Posner, Glenn D.; Sansregret, Andrée",J Obstet Gynaecol Can,72,1

The purpose of this study was to investigate the place of serum surfactant‐D (SP‐D) and angiopoetin‐2 (Ang‐2) levels in predicting severity of disease in patients diagnosed with COVID‐19. METHODS: Sixty‐four patients diagnosed with COVID‐19 between September 2020 and February 2021, 50 patients diagnosed with community‐acquired pneumonia and a 50‐member healthy control group were included in the study. Plasma samples and clinical data were collected within 72 h after admission, during hospital stay. Serum SP‐D and Ang‐2 concentrations were measured using the enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: SP‐D and Ang‐2 levels were significantly higher in the mild–moderate pneumonia and severe/critical patient groups compared to the asymptomatic and noncomplicated COVID‐19 patients (p < 0.001 for all groups). Serum SP‐D and Ang‐2 levels of severe‐critical COVID‐19 patients were significantly higher than CAP patients (p < 0.001). Powerful correlation was present between clinical severity of COVID‐19 and SP‐D and Ang‐2 levels (r = 0.885 p < 0.001 and r = 0.913 p < 0.001, respectively). Cut‐off values of 37.7 ng/ml (AUC = 0.763, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.667–0.860) for SP‐D and 4208.3 pg/ml (AUC = 0.659, p = 0.004, 95% CI = 0.554–0.763) for Ang‐2 were identified as predictors of COVID‐19 disease at receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. CONCLUSION: SP‐D and Ang‐2 are predictive factors in differentiating COVID‐19 patients and determining severity of disease. These data may be important for the initiation of treatment in the early stage of the disease in patients with COVID‐19.","Alay, Handan; Laloglu, Esra",J Med Virol,72,26

Currently, nintedanib and pirfenidone have become the basis of IPF therapy based on the results of large randomized clinical trials showing their safety and efficacy in reducing disease advancement. However, the goal of completely halting disease progress has not been reached yet. Administering nintedanib with add-on pirfenidone is supposed to enhance the therapeutic benefit by simultaneously acting on two different pathogenic pathways. All this becomes more important in the context of the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) because of the fibrotic consequences following SARS-CoV-2 infection in some patients. However, little information is available about their drug–drug interaction, which is important mainly in polymedicated patients. The aim of this review is to describe the current management of progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (PF-ILDs) in general and of IPF in particular, focusing on the pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between these two drugs and their relationship with other medications in patients with IPF.","Serra López-Matencio, José M.; Gómez, Manuel; Vicente-Rabaneda, Esther F.; González-Gay, Miguel A.; Ancochea, Julio; Castañeda, Santos",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),72,30

Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ulcerative colitis (UC), and polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis. To date, data on tofacitinib treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic are limited. OBJECTIVES: To summarize current understanding of the use of tofacitinib in adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, and discuss research questions that are yet to be addressed, in order to further inform the safe and effective use of tofacitinib in clinical practice. METHODS: We conducted a review of the literature (as of February 2021), in order to summarize the expert recommendations for the management of RA, PsA, and UC in the context of COVID-19, and to assess the current data regarding the use of tofacitinib in adult patients during the pandemic. RESULTS: Current recommendations for RA, PsA, and UC state that tofacitinib treatment should be continued during the pandemic, except in cases of positive or presumed SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, limited data are available; analyses of data from international rheumatology and gastroenterology registries have suggested that tofacitinib may not be associated with an increased risk of hospitalization or treatment switching in adults with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Further assessment of tofacitinib use in patients with RA, PsA, or UC will be required to elucidate and establish the benefit:risk profile of tofacitinib during the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Howland, Samantha; Deuring, J.

The significant utilization of gesture recognition covers spaces like sign language, medical assistance and virtual reality–augmented reality and so on. The underlying undertaking of a hand gesture-based HCI framework is to acquire raw data which can be accomplished fundamentally by two methodologies: sensor based and vision based. The sensor-based methodology requires the utilization of instruments or the sensors to be genuinely joined to the arm/hand of the user to extract information. While vision-based plans require the obtaining of pictures or recordings of the hand gestures through a still/video camera. Here, we will essentially discuss vision-based hand gesture recognition with a little prologue to sensor-based data obtaining strategies. This paper overviews the primary methodologies in vision-based hand gesture recognition for HCI. Major topics include different types of gestures, gesture acquisition systems, major problems of the gesture recognition system, steps in gesture recognition like acquisition, detection and pre-processing, representation and feature extraction, and recognition. Here, we have provided an elaborated list of databases, and also discussed the recent advances and applications of hand gesture-based systems. A detailed discussion is provided on feature extraction and major classifiers in current use including deep learning techniques.

Our sequence data from a mitochondrial gene fragment (1176 base pair long) had a similarity of between 99% and 89% to Dipylidium caninum. We determined infection prevalence in 146 faecal samples from 124 known animals in three social groups (termed clans) using molecular screening and Dipylidium proglottid presence. Our analysis revealed significantly higher infection prevalence in juveniles (55%) than adults (15.8%), indicating that predominantly juveniles maintained infection in clans. The likelihood of infection in juveniles significantly: (1) increased as the number of adults and older juveniles (>6 months) at communal dens increased, implying a positive relationship between this factor and the size of the intermediate host (probably a flea species) population at communal dens; (2) decreased as the number of younger juveniles (<6 months) increased, suggesting that the chance of susceptible juveniles ingesting infected fleas during self-grooming declined as the number of infected fleas per younger juvenile declined; and (3) decreased during periods of low prey abundance in clan territories when an increased reliance on long-distances foraging excursions reduces the number of clan members visiting communal dens, possibly resulting in a decline in flea populations at dens. Long-distance foraging also increases the intervals (in days) between nursing visits by lactating females to their offspring. Lengthy intervals between milk intake by infected juveniles may reduce adult Dipylidium fecundity and hence decrease infection prevalence in the den flea population. Our study provides useful insights into Dipylidium epidemiology in a social carnivore population subject to large fluctuations in prey abundance.","East, Marion L.; Kurze, Christoph; Wilhelm, Kerstin; Benhaiem, Sarah; Hofer, Heribert",Int J Parasitol Parasites Wildl,72,32

The current paper thus explores the extent and distribution of probable PTSD among patients attending general practices in England. Cross-sectional survey data from adult patients (n = 1058) attending 11 general practices in southwest England were analysed. Patients were recruited from waiting rooms and completed anonymous questionnaires, including measures of depression, anxiety and risky alcohol use. Current probable PTSD was measured using the 4-item Primary Care PTSD Scale (PC-PTSD). Results indicated 15.1% of patients that exhibited probable PTSD (PC-PTSD ≥ 3), with higher levels observed in practices from deprived areas. There were 53.8% of patients with probable PTSD that expressed the desire for help with these issues. The analyses suggested that rates were lowest among older adults, and highest among patients who were not in cohabitating relationships or were unemployed. Measures of anxiety and depression were associated with 10-fold and 16-fold increases in risk of probable PTSD, respectively, although there were no discernible associations with risky drinking. Such preliminary findings highlight the need for vigilance for PTSD in routine general practice in the UK, and signal a strong need for additional research and attention in this context.","Cowlishaw, Sean; Metcalf, Olivia; Stone, Caleb; O’Donnell, Meaghan; Lotzin, Annett; Forbes, David; Hegarty, Kelsey; Kessler, David",J Clin Psychol Med Settings,72,16

Therefore, a scoping review was conducted to identify challenges faced by caregivers of children with neurodevelopmental disorders during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to consolidate parenting interventions and guidelines. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on Embase, PsycInfo, PubMed, Scopus, and LitCovid. All article types published between December 2019 and November 2020 which reported on intervention guidelines and experiences of families with children with neurodevelopmental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Qualitative themes, quantitative data, and article summaries were charted, and a thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Twenty-nine articles were included in the review. Three themes were generated: (a) behavioral issues and health concerns, (b) disruptions of lifelines and daily routines, and (c) existing programs, models, and guidelines to support families. Additionally, a list of caregiver strategies such as scheduling regular online consultations, maintaining online therapy, educating a child on COVID-19, and preventive behaviors, creating a structured daily schedule and reinforcement system, and selecting child-appropriate activities was consolidated. CONCLUSION: This review revealed a lack of evidence-based studies and articles on children with other neurodevelopmental disorders apart from autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.

However, the specific characteristics of these at-risk populations are still not known and approaches to lower mortality are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective electronic health record data analysis of 25,326 subjects tested for COVID-19 between 2/25/20 and 6/22/20 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, a tertiary health care center in the racially diverse Southern U.S. The primary outcome was mortality in COVID-19-positive subjects and the association with subject characteristics and comorbidities was analyzed using simple and multiple linear logistic regression. RESULTS: The odds ratio of contracting COVID-19 was disproportionately high in Blacks/African-Americans (OR 2.6; 95%CI 2.19-3.10; p<0.0001) and in subjects with obesity (OR 1.93; 95%CI 1.64-2.28; p<0.0001), hypertension (OR 2.46; 95%CI 2.07-2.93; p<0.0001), and diabetes (OR 2.11; 95%CI 1.78-2.48; p<0.0001). Diabetes was also associated with a dramatic increase in mortality (OR 3.62; 95%CI 2.11-6.2; p<0.0001) and emerged as an independent risk factor in this diverse population even after correcting for age, race, sex, obesity and hypertension. Interestingly, we found that metformin treatment was independently associated with a significant reduction in mortality in subjects with diabetes and COVID-19 (OR 0.33; 95%CI 0.13-0.84; p=0.0210). CONCLUSION: Thus, these results suggest that while diabetes is an independent risk factor for COVID-19-related mortality, this risk is dramatically reduced in subjects taking metformin, raising the possibility that metformin may provide a protective approach in this high risk population.","Crouse, A.; Grimes, T.; Li, P.; Might, M.; Ovalle, F.; Shalev, A.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,72,9

SERS measurements from two representative types of ambient aerosol particles, semi-liquid and solid aerosols, are demonstrated; aerosol composed of adenine where the metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) are volume distributed throughout the particle and aerosol composed of polystyrene latex (PSL) beads where the MNPs are surface coated. An enhancement factor > 10(6) is demonstrated from 5 μm aerosols containing trace amounts of adenine (0.1% by mass), with a detection limit of 10(–8) M corresponding to 5 × 10(5) molecules (equivalent to 100 ag in mass or a 50 nm diameter sphere), and a ratio of 100 adenine molecules per Ag NP. SERS signal intensities are linear with particle adenine concentration up to a saturation point. Both the linearity and enhancement factor were confirmed by SERS measurements of adenine as bulk suspensions. The SERS spectra of adenine as bulk suspensions were explored as a function of excitation wavelength ranging from 400 to 800 nm. The two main Raman peaks of adenine at 738 and 1336 cm(–1) exhibit SERS maxima for excitation in the 450–500 nm range for commercially available 40 nm spherical Ag nanoparticles (NPs) used in this study, which shifts to longer wavelengths with the addition of NaCl. Shifts in SERS and spontaneous Raman shifts were observed between aqueous and dry adenine, in agreement with the literature, demonstrating the utility of SERS to possibly study water uptake of aerosols. SERS is measured from MNP surface-coated PSL beads with an enhancement factor of 30 for 5 μm PSLs. Theoretical extrapolation demonstrates that the enhancement factor will increase for decreasing particle size with an estimated enhancement factor of 140 for 1 μm PSLs.","Sivaprakasam, Vasanthi; Hart, Matthew B.",ACS Omega,72,20

If establishing reliable epidemiologic links were not possible, societal costs would exceed $2.0 billion per month. SARS testing with existing polymerase chain reaction assays would have harmful public health and economic consequences if SARS made up <0.1% of circulating FRIs. Increasing influenza vaccination rates among the general population before the onset of respiratory season would save both money and lives.","Khan, Kamran; Muennig, Peter; Gardam, Michael; Zivin, Joshua Graff",Emerg Infect Dis,72,30

Evidence suggests that obesity correlates with 13 types of cancer. The objective is to provide an overview of evaluation and selection of evidence-based content; details of the implementation process; modifications needed to tailor education programs to specific needs of different target audiences; and demonstrate challenges of implementing a community-based prevention program intended to reduce cancer incidence and mortality in Mexican-Americans. We used the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) to develop a 10-topic menu of educational classes using elements of multiple evidence-based curricula. Outcome measures for physical activity and nutrition were determined using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and the Dietary Screener Questionnaire (DSQ). Weight status was determined using weight, body fat, and body mass index (BMI). To date, 2845 adults received wellness education from our program. Multiple delivery models were used to reach a larger audience; they included a 4-week model, 5-week model, employer model, low-income housing, 1- and 2-h sessions, and clinic encounters. Individuals were given education at multiple community locations including senior centers (14%), churches (0.6%), employers (17.6%), low-income housing (8.2%), community centers (16.6%), clinics (11.5%), and schools (32.5%). Our study indicates that our delivery model is feasible and can disseminate evidence-based obesity education. Further investigation is necessary to assess long-term behavioral change and to assess the most effective model for delivery.","Valenzuela, Roy; Morales, Alma; Sheen, Jon; Rangel, Sylvia; Salinas, Jennifer J.",J Cancer Educ,72,21

These include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), AIM2-like receptors (ALRs), and cytosolic DNA sensors. The binding of PAMPs to these receptors triggers the production of type I interferon (IFN) and inflammatory cytokines. Type I IFN induces the expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), which protect surrounding cells from infection. Some ISGs are nucleic acids-binding proteins that bind viral nucleic acids and suppress their replication. As nucleic acids are essential components that store and transmit genetic information in every species, infectious pathogens have developed systems to escape from the host nucleic acid recognition system. Host cells also have their own nucleic acids that are frequently released to the extracellular milieu or the cytoplasm during cell death or stress responses, which, if able to bind pattern-recognition receptors, would induce autoimmunity and inflammation. Therefore, host cells have acquired mechanisms to protect themselves from contact with their own nucleic acids. In this review, we describe recent research progress into the nucleic acid recognition mechanism and the molecular bases of discrimination between self and non-self-nucleic acids.","Kawasaki, Takumi; Kawai, Taro",Int Rev Cell Mol Biol,72,1

In response, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) established the national “Containment Scout Initiative” (CSI) to support the local health authorities with a short-term workforce solution. It is part of a range of measures for strengthening the public health system in order to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany. The CSI is an example of how solutions to address critical health system capacity issues can be implemented quickly. It also demonstrates that medical or health-related backgrounds may not be necessary to support health authorities with pandemic-specific tasks and fulfil accurate contact tracing. However, it is a short-term solution and cannot compensate for the lack of existing qualified staff as well as other deficits that exist within the public health sector in Germany. This article describes the structure and process of the first phase of this initiative in order to support health policymakers, public health practitioners, and researchers considering innovative and flexible approaches for addressing urgent workforce capacity issues.","Said, Dunja; Brinkwirth, Simon; Taylor, Angelina; Markwart, Robby; Eckmanns, Tim",Int J Environ Res Public Health,72,26

To determine the mechanism(s) of protection, lymph node and central nervous system (CNS) tissues from SINV-infected mice treated daily for 1 week with low (0.3mg/kg) or high (0.6mg/kg) dose DON were examined. DON treatment suppressed lymphocyte proliferation in cervical lymph nodes resulting in reduced CNS immune cell infiltration, inflammation, and cell death compared to untreated SINV-infected mice. Production of SINV-specific antibody and interferon-gamma were also impaired by DON treatment with a delay in virus clearance. Cessation of treatment allowed activation of the antiviral immune response and viral clearance, but revived CNS pathology, demonstrating the ability of the immune response to mediate both CNS damage and virus clearance.","Baxter, Victoria K.; Glowinski, Rebecca; Braxton, Alicia M.; Potter, Michelle C.; Slusher, Barbara S.; Griffin, Diane E.",Virology,72,1

In this study, we have verified if the fulminant hepatitis induced by MHV3 could be related to an impairment of innate immunity. Groups of three C57BL/6 mice were infected with the pathogenic L2-MHV3 or attenuated YAC-MHV3 viruses, and the natural killer (NK) cell populations from liver, spleen and bone marrow were analysed. The percentage of intrahepatic NK1·1(+)T cell receptor (TCR)(−) cells did not increase while NK1·1(+)TCR(inter) cells decreased in both L2-MHV3- and YAC-MHV3-infected mice. Concurrently, splenic and myeloid NK1·1(+) cells decreased in L2-MHV3-infected mice. However, the cytotoxic activity of NK cells increased in liver and decreased in bone marrow from pathogenic L2-MHV3-infected mice while no modification was detected in YAC-MHV3-infected mice. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that both normal and larger splenic or myeloid NK cells decreased more in pathogenic L2-MHV3-infected mice than in attenuated YAC-MHV3-infected mice. In vitro viral infections of interleukin (IL)-15-stimulated lymphoid cells from liver and bone marrow revealed that L2-MHV3 induced higher decreases in cell viability of NK1·1(+) cells than the YAC-MHV3 variant. The NK cell decreases were due to the viral permissivity leading to cytopathic effects characterized by cell rounding, syncytia formation and apoptosis. Larger NK(+) syncytia were observed in L2-MHV3-infected cells than in YAC-MHV3-infected cells. These results suggest that NK cell production is impaired by viral infection favouring fulminant hepatitis.","LEHOUX, M; JACQUES, A; LUSIGNAN, S; LAMONTAGNE, L",Clinical & Experimental Immunology,72,11

Enhancing global capacity to study and interpret infectious disease surveillance data, and to develop data-driven computational models to guide policy, represents one of the most cost-effective, and yet overlooked, ways to prepare for the next pandemic. Epidemiological and behavioral data from recent pandemics and historic scourges have provided rich opportunities for validation of computational models, while new sequencing technologies and the ‘big data’ revolution present new tools for studying the epidemiology of outbreaks in real time. For the past two decades, the Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies (DIEPS) of the NIH Fogarty International Center has spearheaded two synergistic programs to better understand and devise control strategies for global infectious disease threats. The Multinational Influenza Seasonal Mortality Study (MISMS) has strengthened global capacity to study the epidemiology and evolutionary dynamics of influenza viruses in 80 countries by organizing international research activities and training workshops. The Research and Policy in Infectious Disease Dynamics (RAPIDD) program and its precursor activities has established a network of global experts in infectious disease modeling operating at the research-policy interface, with collaborators in 78 countries. These activities have provided evidence-based recommendations for disease control, including during large-scale outbreaks of pandemic influenza, Ebola and Zika virus. Together, these programs have coordinated international collaborative networks to advance the study of emerging disease threats and the field of computational epidemic modeling. A global community of researchers and policy-makers have used the tools and trainings developed by these programs to interpret infectious disease patterns in their countries, understand modeling concepts, and inform control policies. Here we reflect on the scientific achievements and lessons learnt from these programs (h-index = 106 for RAPIDD and 79 for MISMS), including the identification of outstanding researchers and fellows; funding flexibility for timely research workshops and working groups (particularly relative to more traditional investigator-based grant programs); emphasis on group activities such as large-scale modeling reviews, model comparisons, forecasting challenges and special journal issues; strong quality control with a light touch on outputs; and prominence of training, data-sharing, and joint publications.","Nelson, Martha I.; Lloyd-Smith, James O.; Simonsen, Lone; Rambaut, Andrew; Holmes, Edward C.; Chowell, Gerardo; Miller, Mark A.; Spiro, David J.; Grenfell, Bryan; Viboud, Cécile",Epidemics,72,24

Evidence suggests that virus transmission can be reduced by face coverings, but robust evidence for how mask usage might affect safe distancing parameters is lacking. Accordingly, we set out to quantify the effects of face coverings on respiratory tract droplet deposition. We tested an anatomically realistic manikin head which ejected fluorescent droplets of water and human volunteers, in speaking and coughing conditions without a face covering, or with a surgical mask or a single-layer cotton face covering. We quantified the number of droplets in flight using laser sheet illumination and UV-light for those that had landed at table height at up to 2 m. For human volunteers, expiratory droplets were caught on a microscope slide 5 cm from the mouth. Whether manikin or human, wearing a face covering decreased the number of projected droplets by less than 1000-fold. We estimated that a person standing 2 m from someone coughing without a mask is exposed to over 10 000 times more respiratory droplets than from someone standing 0.5 m away wearing a basic single-layer mask. Our results indicate that face coverings show consistent efficacy at blocking respiratory droplets and thus provide an opportunity to moderate social distancing policies. However, the methodologies we employed mostly detect larger (non-aerosol) sized droplets. If the aerosol transmission is later determined to be a significant driver of infection, then our findings may overestimate the effectiveness of face coverings.","Bandiera, Lucia; Pavar, Geethanjali; Pisetta, Gabriele; Otomo, Shuji; Mangano, Enzo; Seckl, Jonathan R.; Digard, Paul; Molinari, Emanuela; Menolascina, Filippo; Viola, Ignazio Maria",R Soc Open Sci,72,14

METHODS: An online survey was conducted between March 24 and April 29, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 343 oncologists from 28 countries participated. The median age was 43 years (range, 29-68 years), and the majority were male (62%). At the time of the survey, nearly all participants self-reported an outbreak in their country (99.7%). Personal protective equipment was available to all participants, of which surgical mask was the most common (n = 308; 90%). Telemedicine, in the form of phone or video encounters, was common and implemented by 80% (n = 273). Testing patients with cancer for COVID-19 via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction before systemic treatment was not routinely implemented: 58% reported no routine testing, 39% performed testing in selected patients, and 3% performed systematic testing in all patients. The most significant factors influencing an oncologist’s decision making regarding choice of systemic therapy included patient age and comorbidities (81% and 92%, respectively). Although hormonal treatments and tyrosine kinase inhibitors were considered to be relatively safe, cytotoxic chemotherapy and immune therapies were perceived as being less safe or unsafe by participants. The vast majority of participants stated that during the pandemic they would use less chemotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and steroids. Although treatment in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and first-line metastatic disease was less affected, most of the participants stated that they would be more hesitant to recommend second- or third-line therapies in metastatic disease. CONCLUSION: Decision making by oncologists has been significantly influenced by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Ürün, Yüksel; Hussain, Syed A.; Bakouny, Ziad; Castellano, Daniel; Kılıçkap, Saadettin; Morgan, Gilberto; Mckay, Rana R.; Pels, Kevin; Schmidt, Andrew; Doroshow, Deborah B.; Schütz, Fábio; Albiges, Laurence; Lopes, Gilberto; Catto, James W.

This surge in death necessitates identification of resource needs and relies on modelling resource and understanding anticipated surges in demand. Our aim was to develop a generic computer model that could estimate resources required for end-of-life (EoL) care delivery during the pandemic. SETTING: A discrete event simulation model was developed and used to estimate resourcing needs for a geographical area in the South West of England. While our analysis focused on the UK setting, the model is flexible to changes in demand and setting. PARTICIPANTS: We used the model to estimate resourcing needs for a population of around 1 million people. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The model predicts the per-day ‘staff’ and ‘stuff’ resourcing required to meet a given level of incoming EoL care activity. RESULTS: A mean of 11.97 hours of additional community nurse time, up to 33 hours of care assistant time and up to 30 hours additional care from care assistant night sits will be required per day as a result of out of hospital COVID-19 deaths based on the model prediction. Specialist palliative care demand is predicted to increase up to 19 hours per day. An additional 286 anticipatory medicine bundles per month will be necessary to alleviate physical symptoms at the EoL care for patients with COVID-19: an average additional 10.21 bundles of anticipatory medication per day. An average additional 9.35 syringe pumps could be needed to be in use per day. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis for a large region in the South West of England shows the significant additional physical and human resource required to relieve suffering at the EoL as part of a pandemic response.","Chalk, Daniel; Robbins, Sara; Kandasamy, Rohan; Rush, Kate; Aggarwal, Ajay; Sullivan, Richard; Chamberlain, Charlotte",BMJ Open,72,3

Such audiovisual integration of speech cues, known as the McGurk effect, is stable within but variable across individuals. When the visual or auditory cues are degraded, due to signal distortion or the perceiver's sensory impairment, reliance on cues via the impoverished modality decreases. This study tested whether cue-reliance adjustments due to exposure to reduced cue availability are persistent and transfer to subsequent perception of speech with all cues fully available. A McGurk experiment was administered at the beginning and after a month of mandatory face-mask wearing (enforced in Czechia during the 2020 pandemic). Responses to audio-visually incongruent stimuli were analyzed from 292 persons (ages 16-55), representing a cross-sectional sample, and 41 students (ages 19-27), representing a longitudinal sample. The extent to which the participants relied exclusively on visual cues was affected by testing time in interaction with age. After a month of reduced access to lipreading, reliance on visual cues (present at test) somewhat lowered for younger and increased for older persons. This implies that adults adapt their speech perception faculty to an altered environmental availability of multimodal cues, and that younger adults do so more efficiently. This finding demonstrates that besides sensory impairment or signal noise, which reduce cue availability and thus affect audio-visual cue reliance, having experienced a change in environmental conditions can modulate the perceiver's (otherwise relatively stable) general bias towards different modalities during speech communication.","Chládková, Kateřina; Podlipský, Václav Jonáš; Nudga, Natalia; Šimáčková, Šárka",Psychonomic bulletin & review,72,1

Assessing and quantifying the transmissibility and competitive advantage of the Delta variant is of major significance for countries around the world so that appropriate measures to mitigate and even eliminate the epidemic can be introduced. Aiming at such problems, we proposed a method to model the invasion process of a novel strain and estimate the competitive advantage of the invading strain over the local strain. We applied this method to study the invasion and spread of the Delta variant into England. We have estimated the basic reproduction number of the Delta variant as being 49% higher than that of the Alpha variant (CI: 45–52%), assuming a mean generation interval of 5 days with a standard deviation of 3 days.

Among these compounds, 184 showed high antiviral potential against rhinovirus or picornavirus by quantitative structure–activity relationship analysis. (E)-α-atlantone; 14-hydroxy-α-muurolene; allo-aromadendrene epoxide; amorpha-4,9-dien-2-ol; aristochene; azulenol; germacrene A; guaia-6,9-diene; hedycaryol; humulene epoxide II; α-amorphene; α-cadinene; α-calacorene and α-muurolene showed by a molecular docking study the best result for four target proteins that are essential for SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle. In addition, other parameters obtained for the selected compounds indicated low toxicity and showed good probability to achieve cell permeability and be used as a drug. These results guided the second literature search which included other species in addition to native Brazilian plants. The majority presence of any of these compounds was reported for essential oils from 45 species. In view of the few studies relating essential oils and antiviral activity, this review is important for future assays against the new coronavirus.

Originating in Wuhan, China, in December, 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by WHO on March 11, 2020. In recognition of the severity of the outbreak, and having the longest shared border with China, the Government of Mongolia activated the State Emergency Committee in January, 2020, on the basis of the 2017 Disaster Protection Law. As a result, various public health measures have been taken that led to delaying the first confirmed case of COVID-19 until March 10, 2020, and with no intensive care admissions or deaths until July 6, 2020. These measures included promoting universal personal protection and preventions, such as the use of face masks and handwashing, restricting international travel, suspending all training and educational activities from kindergartens to universities, and banning major public gatherings such as the celebration of the national New Year holiday. These measures have been accompanied by active infection surveillance and self-isolation recommendations. The Mongolian case shows that with robust preventive systems, an effective response to a pandemic can be mounted in a low-income or middle-income country. We hereby examine the emergency preparedness experience, effectiveness, and challenges of the early outbreak policies on COVID-19 prevention in Mongolia, as well as any unintended consequences.","Erkhembayar, Ryenchindorj; Dickinson, Emma; Badarch, Darmaa; Narula, Indermohan; Thomas, Graham Neil; Ochir, Chimedsuren; Manaseki-Holland, Semira",Lancet Glob Health,72,1

It continues a public health emergency, and around one-third of the global community has been affected by latent TB infection (LTBI). This is mostly due to the difficulty in diagnosing and treating patients with TB and LTBI. Exosomes are nanovesicles (40–100 nm) released from different cell types, containing proteins, lipids, mRNA, and miRNA, and they allow the transfer of one’s cargo to other cells. The functional and diagnostic potential of exosomal miRNAs has been demonstrated in bacterial infections, including TB. Besides, it has been recognized that cells infected by intracellular pathogens such as Mtb can be secreting an exosome, which is implicated in the infection’s fate. Exosomes, therefore, open a unique viewpoint on the investigative process of TB pathogenicity. This study explores the possible function of exosomal miRNAs as a diagnostic biomarker. Moreover, we include the latest data on the pathogenic and therapeutic role of exosomal miRNAs in TB.","Mirzaei, Rasoul; Babakhani, Sajad; Ajorloo, Parisa; Ahmadi, Razieh Heidari; Hosseini-Fard, Seyed Reza; Keyvani, Hossein; Ahmadyousefi, Yaghoub; Teimoori, Ali; Zamani, Farhad; Karampoor, Sajad; Yousefimashouf, Rasoul",Mol Med,72,1

Based on the lessons from the German monetary union, this article proposes instead the introduction of parallel currencies to facilitate relative price changes. Parallel currencies in the south would allow an increase in competitiveness of the south via real depreciation. The introduction of a parallel currency in Germany would lead to capital inflows and a real appreciation of the new German mark.

We capitalised on extensive high-resolution HLA data on twenty five human race/ethnic populations to investigate the role of HLA polymorphism on SARS-CoV-2 immunogenicity at the population and individual level. Within populations, we identify wide inter-individual variability in predicted peptide presentation from structural, non-structural and accessory SARS-CoV-2 proteins, according to individual HLA genotype. However, we find similar potential for anti-SARS-CoV-2 cellular immunity at the population level suggesting that HLA polymorphism is unlikely to account for observed disparities in clinical outcomes after COVID-19 among different race/ethnic groups. Our findings provide important insight on the potential role of HLA polymorphism on development of protective immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection and after vaccination and a firm basis for further experimental studies in this field.","Copley, Hannah C.; Gragert, Loren; Leach, Andrew R.; Kosmoliaptsis, Vasilis",Front Immunol,72,16

In this meta-analysis, we calculated the prevalence of such coinfections. Methods: Electronic databases were searched from 1 December 2019 to 31 March 2021. Effect sizes of prevalence were pooled with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To minimize heterogeneity, we performed sub-group analyses. Results: Of the 6189 papers that were identified, 72 articles were included in the systematic review (40 case series and 32 cohort studies) and 68 articles (38 case series and 30 cohort studies) were included in the meta-analysis. Of the 31,953 SARS-CoV-2 patients included in the meta-analysis, the overall pooled proportion who had a laboratory-confirmed bacterial infection was 15.9% (95% CI 13.6–18.2, n = 1940, 49 studies, I(2) = 99%, p < 0.00001), while 3.7% (95% CI 2.6–4.8, n = 177, 16 studies, I(2) = 93%, p < 0.00001) had fungal infections and 6.6% (95% CI 5.5–7.6, n = 737, 44 studies, I(2) = 96%, p < 0.00001) had other respiratory viruses. SARS-CoV-2 patients in the ICU had higher co-infections compared to ICU and non-ICU patients as follows: bacterial (22.2%, 95% CI 16.1–28.4, I(2) = 88% versus 14.8%, 95% CI 12.4–17.3, I(2) = 99%), and fungal (9.6%, 95% CI 6.8–12.4, I(2) = 74% versus 2.7%, 95% CI 0.0–3.8, I(2) = 95%); however, there was an identical other respiratory viral co-infection proportion between all SARS-CoV-2 patients [(ICU and non-ICU) and the ICU only] (6.6%, 95% CI 0.0–11.3, I(2) = 58% versus 6.6%, 95% CI 5.5–7.7, I(2) = 96%). Funnel plots for possible publication bias for the pooled effect sizes of the prevalence of coinfections was asymmetrical on visual inspection, and Egger’s tests confirmed asymmetry (p values < 0.05). Conclusion: Bacterial co-infection is relatively high in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2, with little evidence of S. aureus playing a major role.

This study analyzed the prevalence and clinical characteristics of three HRV groups (HRV‐A, ‐B, and ‐C) among 1,165 children aged 14 years or younger who were hospitalized with acute lower respiratory tract infection in China. PCR or reverse transcription‐PCR was performed to detect 14 respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from September 2007 to August 2008 in Changsha, China. HRV was detected in 202 (17.3%) of the 1,165 children; 25.3% of the HRV‐positive children were 13–36 months of age (χ(2) = 22.803, P = 0.000). HRV was detected year round and peaked between September and December. Fifty‐three percent of the HRV‐positive samples were also positive for other respiratory viruses; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common secondary virus. Phylogenetic analysis using the VP4/VP2 region grouped the HRV‐positive strains as follows: 101 HRV‐A (50.0%), 21 HRV‐B (10.4%), and 80 HRV‐C (39.6%). HRV‐A infections occurred predominantly in spring and autumn, and the peak prevalence of HRV‐C was in early winter and late autumn. HRV‐B infections were less common in spring (χ(2) = 31.914, P = 0.000). No significant difference in clinical severity or presentation was found between patients with HRV single infection and HRV co‐detections. Furthermore, the clinical characterizations did not differ among the three HRV species. These results suggest that HRV‐C is an important viral agent along with HRV‐A and HRV‐B and that among hospitalized children with acute lower respiratory tract infection in China, the three HRV genotypes have similar clinical characteristics.

TLRs 7/8 are located in the endosomal compartment and activate a specific signaling pathway in a MyD88-dependant manner. According to their involvement into various autoimmune, inflammatory and malignant diseases, researchers have designed diverse TLRs 7/8 ligands able to boost or block the inherent signal transduction. These modulators are often small synthetic compounds and most act as agonists and to a much lesser extent as antagonists. Some of them have reached preclinical and clinical trials, and only one has been approved by the FDA and EMA, imiquimod. The key to the success of these modulators probably lies in their combination with other therapies as recently demonstrated. We gather in this review more than 360 scientific publications, reviews and patents, relating the extensive work carried out by researchers on the design of TLRs 7/8 modulators, which are classified firstly by their biological activities (agonist or antagonist) and then by their chemical structures, which total syntheses are not discussed here. This review also reports about 90 clinical cases, thereby showing the biological interest of these modulators in multiple pathologies.","Patinote, Cindy; Karroum, Nour Bou; Moarbess, Georges; Cirnat, Natalina; Kassab, Issam; Bonnet, Pierre-Antoine; Deleuze-Masquéfa, Carine",European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry,72,25

In this review, recent trends in the synthesis and application of heterogeneous Fenton catalysts for the abatement of organic pollutants and disinfection of microorganisms are discussed. It is noted that as the complexity of cell wall increases, the resistance level towards various disinfectants increases and it requires either harsh conditions or longer exposure time for the complete disinfection. In case of viruses, enveloped viruses (e.g. SARS-CoV-2) are found to be more susceptible to disinfectants than the non-enveloped viruses. The introduction of plasmonic systems with the Fenton catalysts broaden the visible light absorption efficiency of the hybrid material, and incorporation of semiconductor material improves the rate of regeneration of Fe(II) from Fe(III). A special emphasis is given to the use of Fenton catalysts for antibacterial applications. Composite materials of magnetite and ferrites remain a champion in this area because of their easy separation and reuse, owing to their magnetic properties. Iron minerals supported on clay materials, perovskites, carbon materials, zeolites and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) dramatically increase the catalytic degradation rate of contaminants by providing high surface area, good mechanical stability, and improved electron transfer. Moreover, insights to the zero-valent iron and its capacity to remove a wide range of organic pollutants, heavy metals and bacterial contamination are also discussed. Real world applications and the role of natural organic matter are summarised. Parameter optimisation (e.g. light source, dosage of catalyst, concentration of H(2)O(2)etc.), sustainable models for the reusability or recyclability of the catalyst and the theoretical understanding and mechanistic aspects of the photo-Fenton process are also explained. Additionally, this review summarises the opportunities and future directions of research in the heterogeneous Fenton catalysis.","Thomas, Nishanth; Dionysiou, Dionysios D.; Pillai, Suresh C.",J Hazard Mater,72,16

The independent role of each component contributing to the risk of COVID-19 is unknown, and how some non-cardiometabolic comorbidities affect the risk of COVID-19 remains unclear. Methods A retrospective follow-up design was adopted. A total of 1,160 laboratory-confirmed patients were enrolled from nine provinces in China. Data on comorbidities were obtained from the patients’ medical records. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the associations between comorbidities (cardiometabolic or non-cardiometabolic diseases), clinical severity, and treatment outcomes of COVID-19. Results Overall, 158 (13.6%) patients were diagnosed with severe illness and 32 (2.7%) had unfavorable outcomes. Hypertension (2.87, 1.30–6.32), type 2 diabetes (T2DM) (3.57, 2.32–5.49), cardiovascular disease (CVD) (3.78, 1.81–7.89), fatty liver disease (7.53, 1.96–28.96), hyperlipidemia (2.15, 1.26–3.67), other lung diseases (6.00, 3.01–11.96), and electrolyte imbalance (10.40, 3.00–26.10) were independently linked to increased odds of being severely ill. T2DM (6.07, 2.89–12.75), CVD (8.47, 6.03–11.89), and electrolyte imbalance (19.44, 11.47–32.96) were also strong predictors of unfavorable outcomes. Women with comorbidities were more likely to have severe disease on admission (5.46, 3.25–9.19), while men with comorbidities were more likely to have unfavorable treatment outcomes (6.58, 1.46–29.64) within two weeks. Conclusion Besides hypertension, diabetes, and CVD, fatty liver disease, hyperlipidemia, other lung diseases, and electrolyte imbalance were independent risk factors for COVID-19 severity and poor treatment outcome.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated glycemic control in young T1D patients using the DexcomG6(®) system before the Italian lockdown (February 10–23, 2020—Time 0) and during lockdown (April 17–30, 2020—Time 1). Data on age, type of insulin therapy, number of telemedicine visits and physical activity of 202 patients with T1D and a median age of 18.2 years (range: 6–39) were collected. RESULTS: Data showed a significant improvement of TIR from 54.58% at T0 to 59.09% at T1 (p ≤0.0001). Glycemic control improved significantly in patients ≥14 years old, showing the best outcome in the “university students and young adults” group (55.40% at T0 and 61.37% at T1, p ≤0.001). All patients reduced physical activity during lockdown; in the 56 patients of “intense physical activity” group both at T0 and T1 TIR increased from ±56.91 to 64.11% (p ≤0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the lockdown led to an unexpected improvement in glycemic control of young patients with T1D. A healthier and stressless lifestyle changes in association with the maintenance of physical activity resulted in a significant age-proportional improvement in glycemic control.","Minuto, Nicola; Bassi, Marta; Montobbio, Carolina; Vinci, Francesco; Mercuri, Claudia; Perri, Francesca Nastasia; Cabri, Mara; Calevo, Maria Grazia; d’Annunzio, Giuseppe; Maghnie, Mohamad",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),72,18

A new betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), has been recognized as the pathogen responsible for this infection. Patients affected by tumors are more vulnerable to infection owing to poor health status, concomitant chronic diseases, and immunosuppressive conditions provoked by both the cancer and antitumor therapies. In this review, we have analyzed some lesser known aspects of the relationship between neoplasms and SARS-CoV-2 infection, starting from the different expression of the ACE2 receptor of the virus in the various neoplastic pathologies, and the roles that different cytokine patterns could have in vulnerability to infection and the appearance of complications. This review also reports the rationale for a possible use of drugs commonly employed in neoplastic therapy, such as bevacizumab, ibrutinib, selinexor, thalidomide, carfilzomib, and PD-1 inhibitors, for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we have highlighted some diagnostic challenges in the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer-infected patients. The combination of these two health problems—tumors and a pandemic virus—could become a catastrophe if not correctly handled. Careful and judicious management of cancer patients with SARS-Cov-2 could support a better outcome for these patients during the current pandemic.","Allegra, Alessandro; Pioggia, Giovanni; Tonacci, Alessandro; Musolino, Caterina; Gangemi, Sebastiano",Cancers (Basel),72,1

CV risk is associated with high values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and depends on the presence of risk factors, both modifiable and not modifiable, such as overweight, obesity, physical exercise, smoking, age, family history, and gender. The main target organs affected by AH are the heart, brain, vessels, kidneys, and eye retina. AH onset can be counteracted or delayed by adopting a proper diet, characterized by a low saturated fat and sodium intake, a high fruit and vegetable intake, a moderate alcohol consumption, and achieving and maintaining over time the ideal body weight. In this review, we analyzed how a new nutritional approach, named caloric restriction diet (CRD), can provide a significant reduction in blood pressure values and an improvement of the endothelial dysfunction. In fact, CRD is able to counteract aging and delay the onset of CV and neurodegenerative diseases through the reduction of body fat mass, systolic and diastolic values, free radicals production, and oxidative stress. Currently, there are few studies on CRD effects in the long term, and it would be advisable to perform observational studies with longer follow-up.","Di Daniele, Nicola; Marrone, Giulia; Di Lauro, Manuela; Di Daniele, Francesca; Palazzetti, Daniela; Guerriero, Cristina; Noce, Annalisa",Nutrients,72,28

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this project was to support primary health care provision with a digital health platform that will allow primary care physicians and nurses to remotely manage the care of patients with chronic diseases or COVID-19 infections. METHODS: For the rapid design and implementation of a digital platform to support primary health care services, we followed the Design Science implementation framework: (1) problem identification and motivation, (2) definition of the objectives aligned with goal-oriented care, (3) artefact design and development based on Scrum, (4) solution demonstration, (5) evaluation, and (6) communication. RESULTS: The digital platform was developed for the specific objectives of the project and successfully piloted in 3 primary health care centers in the Lisbon Health Region. Health professionals (n=53) were able to remotely manage their first patients safely and thoroughly, with high degrees of satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Although still in the first steps of implementation, its positive uptake, by both health care providers and patients, is a promising result. There were several limitations including the low number of participating health care units. Further research is planned to deploy the platform to many more primary health care centers and evaluate the impact on patient’s health related outcomes.","Lapão, Luís Velez; Peyroteo, Mariana; Maia, Melanie; Seixas, Jorge; Gregório, João; Mira da Silva, Miguel; Heleno, Bruno; Correia, Jorge César",J Med Internet Res,72,22

Since inducing effective immunity depends on the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity, a deeper understanding of innate immune responses elicited by intramuscularly injected ChAd vectors in tissues can advance the platform’s development. Using different candidate vaccines based on the Group C ChAd type 155 (ChAd155) vector, we characterized early immune responses in injected muscles and draining lymph nodes (dLNs) from mice, and complemented these analyses by evaluating cytokine responses and gene expression patterns in peripheral blood from ChAd155-injected macaques. In mice, vector DNA levels gradually decreased post-immunization, but local transgene mRNA expression exhibited two transient peaks [at 6 h and Day (D)5], which were most obvious in dLNs. This dynamic pattern was mirrored by the innate responses in tissues, which developed as early as 1–3 h (cytokines/chemokines) or D1 (immune cells) post-vaccination. They were characterized by a CCL2- and CXCL9/10-dominated chemokine profile, peaking at 6 h (with CXCL10/CCL2 signals also detectable in serum) and D7, and clear immune-cell infiltration peaks at D1/D2 and D6/D7. Experiments with a green fluorescent protein-expressing ChAd155 vector revealed infiltrating hematopoietic cell subsets at the injection site. Cell infiltrates comprised mostly monocytes in muscles, and NK cells, T cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, and B cells in dLNs. Similar bimodal dynamics were observed in whole-blood gene signatures in macaques: most of the 17 enriched immune/innate signaling pathways were significantly upregulated at D1 and D7 and downregulated at D3, and clustering analysis revealed stronger similarities between D1 and D7 signatures versus the D3 signature. Serum cytokine responses (CXCL10, IL1Ra, and low-level IFN-α) in macaques were predominantly observed at D1. Altogether, the early immune responses exhibited bimodal kinetics with transient peaks at D1/D2 and D6/D7, mostly with an IFN-associated signature, and these features were remarkably consistent across most analyzed parameters in murine tissues and macaque blood. These compelling observations reveal a novel aspect of the dynamics of innate immunity induced by ChAd155-vectored vaccines, and contribute to ongoing research to better understand how adenovectors can promote vaccine-induced immunity.","Collignon, Catherine; Bol, Vanesa; Chalon, Aurélie; Surendran, Naveen; Morel, Sandra; van den Berg, Robert A.; Capone, Stefania; Bechtold, Viviane; Temmerman, Stéphane T.",Front Immunol,72,24

COVID-19 spreads primarily by contacting the virus either from a COVID-19-infected individual through coughing or sneezing or from COVID-19-contaminated surfaces. On March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 as a pandemic. The government of Saudi Arabia was among the first countries in the world to take quick and serious precautions. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has made the public aware of the virus transmission patterns and the importance of quarantine and curfew. Despite strict measures taken, the awareness of people towards infectious viruses remains the most important factor in limiting the widespread of diseases. METHOD: A cross-sectional survey of 1767 participants, was conducted to explore the awareness, attitude and practice of COVID-19 in relation to socioeconomic data among residents in the city of Riyadh. RESULTS: Of all the participants, 58% showed a moderate level of awareness, 95% presented a high attitude and 81% presented an adequate practice regarding COVID-19. Significant positive correlation between awareness-attitude (r = 0.132, p-value < 0.001) and attitude-practice (r = 0.149, p-value < 0.001) were found. The gender of the participants was the only common characteristic significantly associated with both awareness and practice. This study revealed that males showed a slight increase (60%) in the level of awareness compared to female participants (57%), however, when it comes to the practice towards COVID-19, females showed slightly better practice (82%) than males (80%). The World health organization (WHO) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) were the main sources of information. CONCLUSION: Despite the moderate public awareness, their attitude and practice were better. Therefore, public awareness must be improved to be prepared for epidemic and pandemic situations. A comprehensive public health education program is important to increase awareness and to reach sufficient knowledge.","Alahdal, Hadil; Basingab, Fatemah; Alotaibi, Reem",J Infect Public Health,72,1

So far, there is no evidence of SARS‐CoV‐2 detection in Papanicolaou (Pap) smears. Nevertheless, clinicians could be exposed unaware to the coronavirus while performing and handling a Pap smear. We aimed to retrospectively evaluate the presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA in cervical liquid‐based cytology (LBC) samples in women who tested positive for a nasopharyngeal COVID‐19 PCR test. METHODS: From our laboratory database, we identified patients with data on a cervical cancer screening LBC sample paired with a positive nasopharyngeal COVID‐19 PCR test. Relevant LBC samples taken within an incubation period of 14 days and post‐onset RNA shedding interval of 25 days were subsequently tested for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA using RT‐PCR tests. RESULTS: The study group consisted of 102 women. Of those, 23 LBC samples were tested. SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA was detected in one LBC sample from a 26‐year‐old asymptomatic woman taken six days before reporting headaches and knee arthralgia with a positive nasopharyngeal SARS‐CoV‐2 RT‐PCR test. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA in cervical LBC samples at an early asymptomatic stage of COVID‐19. In general, this finding is infrequent in asymptomatic women who tested SARS‐CoV‐2 positive within an incubation of 14 days and a post‐onset RNA shedding period of 25 days. We fully support the current thinking that cervical LBC samples from asymptomatic women pose a low risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 exposure and can be handled in the frame of good microbiological practice and procedures.","Ondič, Ondrej; Černá, Kateřina; Kinkorová‐Luňáčková, Iva; Němcová, Jana; Mejchar, Bořivoj; Chytra, Jan; Bouda, Jiří",Cytopathology,72,33

Methods All relevant and recent guidelines from CDC and FDA, as well as online resources and review articles were consulted. Results Routine COVID-19 screening and triage protocols are unable to detect all infected individuals. With the advancements in diagnostic tools/techniques, COVID-19 testing at home or in the dental office may provide dentists with abilities to evaluate the disease status of their patients. At home or point-of-care tests, providing results within minutes of being administered, would allow for appropriate measures and rapid decisions about dental patients' care process. In this review, we familiarize the reader with current available laboratory and point-of-care COVID-19 screening methods, and, identify and elaborate the options available for use by dentists as well as the regulatory requirements of test administration. Conclusion Dentists need to be familiar with COVID-19 point-of-care testing options.

In total, 602 sera were tested including 223 from RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients, 76 from patients diagnosed with seasonal HCoVs and 303 from coronavirus-negative control sera. We also compared this assay with the EUROIMMUN(R) SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA kit. Among 223 sera obtained from RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients, 180/223 (81%) exhibited reactivity against the nucleocapsid and 70/223 (31%) against the spike protein. Nucleocapsid reactivity was further detected in 9/76 (14%) samples collected from patients diagnosed with seasonal HCoVs and in 15/303 (5%) coronavirus-negative control samples. In the subset of sera collected more than 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms, the sensitivity was 94% and the specificity 93%, the latter value probably reflecting cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses. The automated Western immunoblotting presented a substantial agreement (90%) with the compared ELISA (Cohen's Kappa=0.64).

For people who are visually impaired and people with visual and hearing impairment, navigating through the digital world can be as precarious as moving through the real world. To enable them to connect with the digital world, we propose a solution, Haptic Encoded Language Framework (HELF), that uses haptic technology to enable them to write digital text using swiping gestures and understand the text through vibrations. METHOD: We developed an Android application to present the concept of HELF and evaluate its performance. We tested the application on 13 users (five visually impaired and eight sighted individuals). RESULTS: The preliminary exploratory analysis of the proposed framework using the Android application developed reveals encouraging results. Overall, the reading accuracy has been found to be approximately 91%, and the average CPM is found to be 25.7. CONCLUSION: The volunteering users of the HELF Android application found it useful as a means of using the digital media and recommended its usage as an assistive technology for the visually challenged.

Molecular docking (MD) was then performed every 10 ns during the MDS course to ensure the binding of small molecules to the polymerase over the entire time of the simulation. MD revealed the binding ability of four suggested guanosine inhibitors (GIs); (Guanosine substituted with OH and SH (phenyl) oxidanyl in the 2′ carbon of the ribose ring). The GIs were compared to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and five anti‐hepatitis C virus drugs (either approved or under clinical trials). The mode of binding and the binding performance of GIs to ZIKV polymerase were found to be the same as GTP. Hence, these compounds were capable of competing GTP for the active site.

During decision-making, policymakers consider an estimate of the effective reproduction number R(t), which is the expected number of secondary infections spread by a single infected individual. OBJECTIVE: We propose a simple method for estimating the time-varying infection rate and the R(t). METHODS: We used a sliding window approach with a Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) model. We estimated the infection rate from the reported cases over a 7-day window to obtain a continuous estimation of R(t). A proposed adaptive SIR (aSIR) model was applied to analyze the data at the state and county levels. RESULTS: The aSIR model showed an excellent fit for the number of reported COVID-19 cases, and the 1-day forecast mean absolute prediction error was <2.6% across all states. However, the 7-day forecast mean absolute prediction error approached 16.2% and strongly overestimated the number of cases when the R(t) was rapidly decreasing. The maximal R(t) displayed a wide range of 2.0 to 4.5 across all states, with the highest values for New York (4.4) and Michigan (4.5). We found that the aSIR model can rapidly adapt to an increase in the number of tests and an associated increase in the reported cases of infection. Our results also suggest that intensive testing may be an effective method of reducing R(t). CONCLUSIONS: The aSIR model provides a simple and accurate computational tool for continuous R(t) estimation and evaluation of the efficacy of mitigation measures.","Shapiro, Mark B; Karim, Fazle; Muscioni, Guido; Augustine, Abel Saju",J Med Internet Res,72,26

This paper presents a quantitative study of the impact of COVID-19 outbreak in Italy during first stages of the epidemic, focusing on the effects on mortality increase among older adults over 80 and its correlation with LTCFs. The study of growth patterns shows a power-law scaling regime for the first stage of the pandemic with an uneven behaviour among different regions as well as for the overall mortality increase according to the different impact of COVID-19. However, COVID-19 incidence rate does not fully explain the differences of mortality impact in older adults among different regions. We define a quantitative correlation between mortality in older adults and the number of people in LTCFs confirming the tremendous impact of COVID-19 on LTCFs. In addition a correlation between LTCFs and undiagnosed cases as well as effects of health system dysfunction is also observed. Our results confirm that LTCFs did not play a protective role on older adults during the pandemic, but the higher the number of elderly people living in LTCFs the greater the increase of both general and COVID-19 related mortality. We also observed that the handling of the crises in LTCFs hampered an efficient tracing of COVID-19 spread and promoted the increase of deaths not directly attributed to SARS-CoV-2.","Amore, Stefano; Puppo, Emanuela; Melara, Josué; Terracciano, Elisa; Gentili, Susanna; Liotta, Giuseppe",Sci Rep,72,13

Aerosol measurement during clinical procedures using particle counting may be confounded by variable natural background aerosol levels or limited by partial volume sampling. The study objective was to quantify any significant aerosol generated from simulated suction clearance procedures. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective quantification of aerosol generation during clinical suction simulation. SETTING: Clean chamber. METHODS: We created a clean environment for particle counting in a transparent neutralized polypropylene chamber. Air was passed through a HEPA 14 class filter to maintain a constant chamber inlet pressure. An optical particle counter was connected in line to the chamber exhaust vent to measure all of the vented particles. The chamber background count was 1 particle ≥0.3 µm per 15 minutes at a flow rate of 1 chamber air change per minute. We used this system to quantify very low aerosol counts generated from suction clearance of a silicone ear canal and at an open air-fluid interface. RESULTS: No clinically significant aerosol generation was found by particle counting of the whole chamber air volume during simulated suction procedures. CONCLUSION: Simulated ear suction clearance and air-fluid interface suction does not generate any significant aerosol. It appears likely that any aerosol potentially generated at the suction tube tip is entrained by incoming air flow.

Leveraging multi-omic datasets to characterize the environment’s role in human health,13.618835,4.6677804,2021,"BACKGROUND: Misoprostol given orally is a commonly used labour induction method. Our Cochrane Review is restricted to studies with low-dose misoprostol (initially ≤ 50 µg), as higher doses pose unacceptably high risks of uterine hyperstimulation. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of low-dose oral misoprostol for labour induction in women with a viable fetus in the third trimester of pregnancy. SEARCH METHODS: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (14 February 2021) and reference lists of retrieved studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing low-dose oral misoprostol (initial dose ≤ 50 µg) versus placebo, vaginal dinoprostone, vaginal misoprostol, oxytocin, or mechanical methods; or comparing oral misoprostol protocols (one- to two-hourly versus four- to six-hourly; 20 µg to 25 µg versus 50 µg; or 20 µg hourly titrated versus 25 µg two-hourly static). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Using Covidence, two review authors independently screened reports, extracted trial data, and performed quality assessments. Our primary outcomes were vaginal birth within 24 hours, caesarean section, and hyperstimulation with foetal heart changes. MAIN RESULTS: We included 61 trials involving 20,026 women. GRADE assessments ranged from moderate- to very low-certainty evidence, with downgrading decisions based on imprecision, inconsistency, and study limitations. Oral misoprostol versus placebo/no treatment (four trials; 594 women) Oral misoprostol may make little to no difference in the rate of caesarean section (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.11; 4 trials; 594 women; moderate-certainty evidence), while its effect on uterine hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes is uncertain (RR 5.15, 95% CI 0.25 to 105.31; 3 trials; 495 women; very low-certainty evidence). Vaginal births within 24 hours was not reported. In all trials, oxytocin could be commenced after 12 to 24 hours and all women had pre-labour ruptured membranes. Oral misoprostol versus vaginal dinoprostone (13 trials; 9676 women) Oral misoprostol probably results in fewer caesarean sections (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.90; 13 trials, 9676 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Subgroup analysis indicated that 10 µg to 25 µg (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.87; 9 trials; 8652 women) may differ from 50 µg (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.34; 4 trials; 1024 women) for caesarean section. Oral misoprostol may decrease vaginal births within 24 hours (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.00; 10 trials; 8983 women; low-certainty evidence) and hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.59; 11 trials; 9084 women; low-certainty evidence). Oral misoprostol versus vaginal misoprostol (33 trials; 6110 women) Oral use may result in fewer vaginal births within 24 hours (average RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95; 16 trials, 3451 women; low-certainty evidence), and less hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.92, 25 trials, 4857 women, low-certainty evidence), with subgroup analysis suggesting that 10 µg to 25 µg orally (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.57; 6 trials, 957 women) may be superior to 50 µg orally (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.11; 19 trials; 3900 women). Oral misoprostol probably does not increase caesarean sections overall (average RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.16; 32 trials; 5914 women; low-certainty evidence) but likely results in fewer caesareans for foetal distress (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.99; 24 trials, 4775 women). Oral misoprostol versus intravenous oxytocin (6 trials; 737 women, 200 with ruptured membranes) Misoprostol may make little or no difference to vaginal births within 24 hours (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.33; 3 trials; 466 women; low-certainty evidence), but probably results in fewer caesarean sections (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.90; 6 trials; 737 women; moderate-certainty evidence). The effect on hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes is uncertain (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.26; 3 trials, 331 women; very low-certainty evidence). Oral misoprostol versus mechanical methods (6 trials; 2993 women) Six trials compared oral misoprostol to transcervical Foley catheter. Misoprostol may increase vaginal birth within 24 hours (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.79; 4 trials; 1044 women; low-certainty evidence), and probably reduces the risk of caesarean section (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.95; 6 trials; 2993 women; moderate-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference in hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.21; 4 trials; 2828 women; low-certainty evidence). Oral misoprostol one- to two-hourly versus four- to six-hourly (1 trial; 64 women) The evidence on hourly titration was very uncertain due to the low numbers reported. Oral misoprostol 20 µg hourly titrated versus 25 µg two-hourly static (2 trials; 296 women) The difference in regimen may have little or no effect on the rate of vaginal births in 24 hours (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.16; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is of very low certainty for all other reported outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose oral misoprostol is probably associated with fewer caesarean sections (and therefore more vaginal births) than vaginal dinoprostone, and lower rates of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes. However, time to birth may be increased, as seen by a reduced number of vaginal births within 24 hours. Compared to transcervical Foley catheter, low-dose oral misoprostol is associated with fewer caesarean sections, but equivalent rates of hyperstimulation. Low-dose misoprostol given orally rather than vaginally is probably associated with similar rates of vaginal birth, although rates may be lower within the first 24 hours. However, there is likely less hyperstimulation with foetal heart changes, and fewer caesarean sections performed due to foetal distress. The best available evidence suggests that low-dose oral misoprostol probably has many benefits over other methods for labour induction. This review supports the use of low-dose oral misoprostol for induction of labour, and demonstrates the lower risks of hyperstimulation than when misoprostol is given vaginally. More trials are needed to establish the optimum oral misoprostol regimen, but these findings suggest that a starting dose of 25 µg may offer a good balance of efficacy and safety.","Kerr, Robbie S; Kumar, Nimisha; Williams, Myfanwy J; Cuthbert, Anna; Aflaifel, Nasreen; Haas, David M; Weeks, Andrew D",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,72,1

Healthy, intact endothelium exhibits an antithrombotic, protective surface between the vascular lumen and vascular smooth muscle cells in the vessel wall. Oxidative stress is an imbalance between anti- and prooxidants, with a subsequent increase of reactive oxygen species, leading to tissue damage. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is of vital importance in the pathobiology of vascular disease. Convincing data indicate that angiotensin II accelerates hypertension and augments the production of reactive oxygen species. This leads to the generation of a proinflammatory phenotype in human endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells by the up-regulation of adhesion molecules, chemokines and cytokines. In addition, angiotensin II also seems to increase thrombin generation, possibly via a direct impact on tissue factor. However, the mechanism of cross-talk between inflammation and haemostasis can also contribute to prothrombotic states in inflammatory environments. Thus, blocking of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system might be an approach to reduce both inflammatory and thrombotic complications in high-risk patients. During COVID-19, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may be activated. The levels of angiotensin II could contribute to the ongoing inflammation, which might result in a cytokine storm, a complication that significantly impairs prognosis. At the outbreak of COVID-19 concerns were raised about the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blocker drugs in patients with COVID-19 and hypertension or other cardiovascular comorbidities. However, the present evidence is in favor of continuing to use of these drugs. Based on experimental evidence, blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system might even exert a potentially protective influence in the setting of COVID-19.","Ekholm, M.; Kahan, T.",Front Pharmacol,72,15

Currently, there is no approved vaccine or drug available to combat the pandemic. COVID-19 main protease (M(pro)) is a key CoV enzyme, which plays an important role in triggering viral replication and transcription, turns it into an attractive target. Therefore, we aim to screen natural products library to find out potential COVID-19 M(pro) inhibitors. Plant-based natural compounds from Sigma-Aldrich plant profiler chemical library have been screened through virtual molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation to identify potential inhibitors of COVID M(pro). Our virtual molecular docking results have shown that there are twenty-eight natural compounds with a greater binding affinity toward the COVID-19 M(pro) inhibition site as compared to the co-crystal native ligand Inhibitor N3 (-7.9 kcal/mol). Also, molecular dynamics simulation results have confirmed that Peonidin 3-O-glucoside, Kaempferol 3-O-β–rutinoside, 4-(3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl)-7-methoxy-5-[(6-O-β-D-xylopyranosyl-β-D-glucopyranosyl)oxy]-2H-1-benzopyran-2-one, Quercetin-3-D-xyloside, and Quercetin 3-O-α-L-arabinopyranoside (selected based on the docking score) possess a significant amount of dynamic properties such as stability, flexibility and binding energy. Our In silco results suggests that all the above mention natural compounds have the potential to be developed as a COVID-19 M(pro) inhibitor.

METHODS: To identify subgroups of patients at risk for unintended health consequences of social distancing, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from a national cohort study of older Veterans with advanced CKD (n=223). Characteristics included activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental ADLs (IADLs), cognition score, depression score, social support, financial stress, symptom burden, and number of chronic conditions. Unintended consequences of social distancing included restricted Life Space mobility, low willingness for video telehealth, reduced in-person contact with caregivers, and food insecurity. We identified subgroups of patients at risk of unintended consequences using model-based recursive partitioning (MoB). RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 77.9 years, 64.6% were white, and 96.9% were male. Overall, 22.4% of participants had restricted Life Space, 33.9% reported low willingness for video telehealth, 19.0% reported reduced caregiver contact, and 3.2% reported food insecurity. For Life Space restriction, four subgroups partitioned (i.e., split) by IADL difficulty, cognition score, and ADL difficulty were identified. The highest rate of restricted Life Space was 54.7% in the subgroup of participants with >3 IADL difficulties For low willingness for telehealth and reduced caregiver contact, separate models identified two subgroups split by cognition score and depression score, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Measures of function, cognition, and depressive symptoms may identify older adults with advanced CKD who are at higher risk for unintended health consequences of social distancing.","Bowling, C Barrett; Berkowitz, Theodore S Z; Smith, Battista; Whitson, Heather E; DePasquale, Nicole; Wang, Virginia; Maciejewski, Matthew L; Olsen, Maren",J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,72,1

SARS-CoV-2 enters into and infects host cells through its spike glycoprotein recognizing the cell receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Here, we noticed that ACE2 was further enhanced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Human germ cells and early embryos express high level of ACE2. Notably, RNA-seq result showed that reduction of H3K27me3, but not H3K4/9/36me3, led to upregulation of Ace2 expression in mouse germ cell line GC-2. In agreement with this result, we found in human embryonic stem cells that ACE2 expression was significantly increased in absence of EZH2, the major enzyme catalyzing H3K27me3. ChIP-seq analysis further confirmed decrease of H3K27me3 signal and increase of H3K27ac signal at ACE2 promoter upon EZH2 knockout. Therefore, we propose that EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 at ACE2 promoter region inhibits ACE2 expression in mammalian cells. This regulatory pattern may also exist in other human cells and tissues. Our discovery provides clues for pathogenesis and targeted drug therapy towards ACE2 expression for prevention and adjuvant therapy of COVID-19.","Li, Yuanyuan; Li, Honggang; Zhou, Liquan",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,72,30

Our objective was to determine whether sampling with a throat swab provides incremental benefit—when used in conjunction with a nasal swab—to detect respiratory viruses among patients with acute pharyngitis in the outpatient setting. FINDINGS: Among 83 university students with acute pharyngitis, we detected respiratory viruses with molecular assays on two samples collected per student: with a flocked nasal mid-turbinate swab and a rayon throat swab. Forty-eight (58 %) patients had virus-positive samples, with 49 virus positives detected by either swab (one patient had a dual viral co-infection). The most common viruses were rhinovirus, coronavirus, and influenza A virus. Specifically, 29 virus positives were detected by both swabs, 14 exclusively by the nasal swab, and six exclusively by the throat swab. The additional six virus positives detected by the throat swab corresponded to an absolute increase in viral detection of 7.1 % (95 % CI: 1.2–12.9 %); the specific viruses detected were four rhinoviruses and two coronaviruses. CONCLUSIONS: The flocked nasal swab samples respiratory viruses well, even among patients whose primary complaint is a sore throat. The rayon throat swab has modest incremental value over and above using the flocked nasal mid-turbinate swab alone, which suggests that while throat swabs alone would not be adequate for respiratory viral surveillance, they may have value as a supplementary test.","Ali, Mohsin; Han, Sangsu; Gunst, Chris J.; Lim, Steve; Luinstra, Kathy; Smieja, Marek",Virol J,72,1

However, the molecular mechanism behind ADE is still elusive. Coronavirus spike protein mediates viral entry into cells by first binding to a receptor on the host cell surface and then fusing viral and host membranes. In this study, we investigated how a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb), which targets the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus spike, mediates viral entry using pseudovirus entry and biochemical assays. Our results showed that MAb binds to the virus surface spike, allowing it to undergo conformational changes and become prone to proteolytic activation. Meanwhile, MAb binds to cell surface IgG Fc receptor, guiding viral entry through canonical viral-receptor-dependent pathways. Our data suggest that the antibody/Fc-receptor complex functionally mimics viral receptor in mediating viral entry. Moreover, we characterized MAb dosages in viral-receptor-dependent, Fc-receptor-dependent, and both-receptors-dependent viral entry pathways, delineating guidelines on MAb usages in treating viral infections. Our study reveals a novel molecular mechanism for antibody-enhanced viral entry and can guide future vaccination and antiviral strategies. IMPORTANCE Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral entry has been observed for many viruses. It was shown that antibodies target one serotype of viruses but only subneutralize another, leading to ADE of the latter viruses. Here we identify a novel mechanism for ADE: a neutralizing antibody binds to the surface spike protein of coronaviruses like a viral receptor, triggers a conformational change of the spike, and mediates viral entry into IgG Fc receptor-expressing cells through canonical viral-receptor-dependent pathways. We further evaluated how antibody dosages impacted viral entry into cells expressing viral receptor, Fc receptor, or both receptors. This study reveals complex roles of antibodies in viral entry and can guide future vaccine design and antibody-based drug therapy.","Wan, Yushun; Shang, Jian; Sun, Shihui; Tai, Wanbo; Chen, Jing; Geng, Qibin; He, Lei; Chen, Yuehong; Wu, Jianming; Shi, Zhengli; Zhou, Yusen; Du, Lanying; Li, Fang",J Virol,72,16

Infectious pathogens such as these are formidable opponents; they can adapt to new hosts or cause variant diseases within new hosts. Many are also resistant to current inactivation techniques.

SARS-CoV-2, through its rapid global spread, has led to the pandemic that we call COVID-19. As of February 1, 2021, the global infections linked to SARS-CoV-2 stand at 103,503,340, with 2,236,960 deaths, and 75,108,099 recoveries. This review attempts to highlight host-pathogen interaction with particular emphasis on the role of epigenetic machinery in regulating the disease. Although researchers, since the start of the pandemic, have been intensely engaged in diverse areas to understand the mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection to find answers that can bring about innovative ways to swiftly treat and prevent disease progression, this review provides an overview on how the host epigenetics is modulated and subverted by SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells and drive immunopathogenesis. Epigenetics is the study that combines genetic and non-genetic factors controlling phenotypic variation, which are primarily a consequence of external and environmental stimuli. These stimuli alter the activity of a gene without impinging on the DNA code. In viral-host interactions, DNA/RNA methylation, non-coding RNAs, chromatin remodeling, and histone modifications are known to regulate and modulate host gene expression patterns. Viruses such as Coronaviruses (an RNA virus) show intrinsic association with these processes. They have evolved the ability to tamper with host epigenetic machinery to interfere with immune sensing pathways to evade host immune response, thereby enhancing its replication and pathogenesis post-entry. These epigenetic alterations allow the virus to weaken the host's immune response to successfully spread infection. How this occurs, and what epigenetic mechanisms are altered is poorly understood both for coronaviruses and other respiratory RNA viruses. The review highlights several cutting-edge aspects of epigenetic work primarily pertinent to SARS-CoV-2, which has been published between 2019 and 2020 to showcase the current knowledge both in terms of success and failures and take lessons that will assist us in understanding the disease to develop better treatments suited to kill SARS-CoV-2.","Saksena, Nitin; Bonam, Srinivasa Reddy; Miranda-Saksena, Monica",Front Genet,72,11

These are highlighted in their impact on performing aerosol-generating endoscopy procedures and the need to accommodate longer room turnaround time for disinfection, ensuring appropriate and consistent safety measures for patients, staff and providers, and emphasizing the importance for screening patients for active coronavirus disease (COVID) infection before endoscopy when possible. Pediatric patients are less likely to exhibit severe COVID-related symptoms so survey-based screening would not be a sensitive measure to identify patients with active infections. To address the restrictions of patients coming for face to face clinic encounters, there has been rapid expansion of telehealth services in a very short time period with several difficulties encountered. To survive these challenges, pediatric gastroenterology practices need to adapt and accept flexibility in clinical operations with ongoing commitment to safety for patients and healthcare workers.","Kriem, Jamal; Rahhal, Riad",World J Gastroenterol,72,1

As well as anti-A, and anti-B antibodies, anti-H is clinically significant because it causes sever hemolytic transfusion reactions. Like se(del), se(302) having a missense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), 302C > T, is characteristic of South Asians with a frequency of 10–30%. We developed a real-time PCR melting curve analysis for detection of se(del) using a 127-bp amplicon encompassing the breakpoint junction. In addition, by performing duplex PCR by amplifying a 65-bp amplicon of the FUT2 coding region at the same time, we could determine the zygosity of se(del) in a single tube. We also developed an Eprobe-mediated PCR assay (Eprobe-PCR) for detection of 302C > T of FUT2. These methods were validated by analyzing 58 Tamils and 54 Sinhalese in Sri Lanka. Both the duplex PCR melting curve analysis for determination of se(del) zygosity and the Eprobe-PCR assay for detection of 302C > T exactly determined three genotypes. In addition, the results of the present methods were in complete agreement with those obtained by previously established methods. The two present methods were reliable and seem to be advantageous for large-scale association studies of FUT2 polymorphisms in South Asian populations.","Soejima, Mikiko; Koda, Yoshiro",Sci Rep,72,1
669848,669848,669848,To the Editor:,13.632504,4.79024,2020-06-23,"OBJECTIVES: This study examines perceptions of the operational and organisational management of a major outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused by a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Perspectives were sought from key decision-makers and clinical staff about the factors perceived to promote and inhibit effective and rapid control of the outbreak. SETTING: A large teaching tertiary healthcare centre in KSA; the outbreak lasted 6 weeks from June 2015. PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected via individual and focus group interviews with 28 key informant participants (9 management decision-makers and 19 frontline healthcare workers). DESIGN: We used qualitative methods of process evaluation to examine perceptions of the outbreak and the factors contributing to, or detracting from successful management. Data were analysed using qualitative thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Five themes and 15 subthemes were found. The themes were related to: (1) the high stress of the outbreak, (2) factors perceived to contribute to outbreak occurrence, (3) factors perceived to contribute to success of outbreak control, (4) factors inhibiting outbreak control and (5) long-term institutional gains in response to the outbreak management. CONCLUSION: Management of the MERS-CoV outbreak at King Abdulaziz Medical City-Riyadh was widely recognised by staff as a serious outbreak of local and national significance. While the outbreak was controlled successfully in 6 weeks, progress in management was inhibited by a lack of institutional readiness to implement infection control (IC) measures and reduce patient flow, low staff morale and high anxiety. Effective management was promoted by greater involvement of all staff in sharing learning and knowledge of the outbreak, developing trust and teamwork and harnessing collective leadership. Future major IC crises could be improved via measures to strengthen these areas, better coordination of media management and proactive staff counselling and support.","Al Knawy, Bandar Abdulmohsen; Al-Kadri, Hanan M F; Elbarbary, Mahmoud; Arabi, Yaseen; Balkhy, Hanan H; Clark, Alex",BMJ Open,72,23

This study used a retrospective, observational analysis of deidentified tests performed at a national clinical laboratory to determine if circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels are associated with severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity rates. Over 190,000 patients from all 50 states with SARS-CoV-2 results performed mid-March through mid-June, 2020 and matching 25(OH)D results from the preceding 12 months were included. Residential zip code data was required to match with US Census data and perform analyses of race/ethnicity proportions and latitude. A total of 191,779 patients were included (median age, 54 years [interquartile range 40.4–64.7]; 68% female. The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was 9.3% (95% C.I. 9.2–9.5%) and the mean seasonally adjusted 25(OH)D was 31.7 (SD 11.7). The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was higher in the 39,190 patients with “deficient” 25(OH)D values (<20 ng/mL) (12.5%, 95% C.I. 12.2–12.8%) than in the 27,870 patients with “adequate” values (30–34 ng/mL) (8.1%, 95% C.I. 7.8–8.4%) and the 12,321 patients with values ≥55 ng/mL (5.9%, 95% C.I. 5.5–6.4%). The association between 25(OH)D levels and SARS-CoV-2 positivity was best fitted by the weighted second-order polynomial regression, which indicated strong correlation in the total population (R(2) = 0.96) and in analyses stratified by all studied demographic factors. The association between lower SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates and higher circulating 25(OH)D levels remained significant in a multivariable logistic model adjusting for all included demographic factors (adjusted odds ratio 0.984 per ng/mL increment, 95% C.I. 0.983–0.986; p<0.001). SARS-CoV-2 positivity is strongly and inversely associated with circulating 25(OH)D levels, a relationship that persists across latitudes, races/ethnicities, both sexes, and age ranges. Our findings provide impetus to explore the role of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease.","Kaufman, Harvey W.; Niles, Justin K.; Kroll, Martin H.; Bi, Caixia; Holick, Michael F.",PLoS One,72,5

The health system has no resources for this huge quantity of patients after the hospital discharge to finish the complete recovery and avoid the chronicity of the symptoms. We propose an application named RespiraConNosotros. The application has been created and designed to guide users in performing respiratory rehabilitation exercises, especially for COVID-19 patients, and it also facilitates patient–physiotherapist contact via chat or video calling to help patients. It is accessible for all users and on all devices. All exercises would be guided and supervised by a specialized physiotherapist who suggests, adapts, and guides the exercise according to the function level of each patient. Data obtained was satisfactory; all patients pointed out the easy access, the intuitive format, and the advantage of communicating with an expert. Concerning functional assessment, all participants improved their score on the Borg scale after performing the intervention with the application.This platform would help respiratory patients to make rehabilitation treatments to recover their pulmonary function and to decrease or eliminate the possible complications they have. It never substitutes any prescribed treatment. In conclusion, RespiraConNosotros is a simple, viable, and safe alternative for the improvement and maintenance of respiratory capacity and patient’s functionality affected by COVID-19. It could be used as a complement to face-to-face treatment when the situation allows it.","Bermejo-Gil, Beatriz María; Pérez-Robledo, Fátima; Llamas-Ramos, Rocío; Silva, Luís Augusto; Sales-Mendes, André; Leithardt, Valderi Reis Quietinho; Llamas-Ramos, Inés",Sensors (Basel),72,26

It was conducted based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA). Criteria for eligibility were all published population-based primary literature in PubMed interface and the Science Direct, dealing with incubation period of COVID-19, written in English, since December 2019 to December 2020. We estimated the mean of the incubation period using meta-analysis, taking into account between-study heterogeneity, and the analysis with moderator variables. RESULTS: This review included 42 studies done predominantly in China. The mean and median incubation period were of maximum 8 days and 12 days respectively. In various parametric models, the 95th percentiles were in the range 10.3–16 days. The highest 99th percentile would be as long as 20.4 days. Out of the 10 included studies in the meta-analysis, 8 were conducted in China, 1 in Singapore, and 1 in Argentina. The pooled mean incubation period was 6.2 (95% CI 5.4, 7.0) days. The heterogeneity (I(2) 77.1%; p < 0.001) was decreased when we included the study quality and the method of calculation used as moderator variables (I(2) 0%). The mean incubation period ranged from 5.2 (95% CI 4.4 to 5.9) to 6.65 days (95% CI 6.0 to 7.2).

The acute and subacute toxicity tests of goat bile (GB) have shown mild diarrhea in mice. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the suppressive effect of GB on parasitemia, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and blood biochemistry to assess liver and kidney function in BALB/c mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty healthy mice were infected with P. berghei ANKA and divided into five groups. Mice in three groups were administered 0.5 mL of 25%, 50%, or 100% of GB by gavage. Animals in Group 4 were administered 187.2 mg/kg BW of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine phosphate as a positive control (POS Group). Mice in fifth group were administered sterile water as negative (NEG) controls. Further, 30 uninfected mice were divided into groups 6-8 and administered GB as were mice in the first three groups. Group 9 included 10 uninfected and untreated animals as healthy controls. Treatments were administered in a 4-day suppressive test followed by daily observation of Giemsa-stained blood smears. On day 7, mice were sacrificed to measure the length and weight of spleens and livers, plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine. RESULTS: GB suppressed parasitemia but did not affect the size and weight of spleens or livers or plasma levels of AST and ALT compared to uninfected GB-treated and healthy control animals. Conversely, plasma levels of BUN and creatinine were suppressed and remained in the normal range in all groups of mice. CONCLUSION: GB suppresses parasitemia with no significant impact on hepatic enzymes in GB-treated infected mice. Liver dysfunction in GB-treated infected mice was due to P. berghei rather than GB treatment.","Arwati, Heny; Bahalwan, Ramadhani R.; Hapsari, Windya T.; Wardhani, Kartika A.; Aini, Kholida N.; Apsari, Putu I.

Methods: The Box-Jenkins methodology was used to develop predictive models and GeoDa software was used to perform spatial autocorrelation. Results: Between 1982 and 2019, the notification rate per 100,000 population of smear-positive pulmonary TB (SPPTB) has dropped 62.2%, while that of extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) has risen 91.3%. For the last decade, the mean detection rate of PTB was 82.6%. At around, 2% of PTB cases were yearly reported in children under 15 years old, a peak in notification rate was observed in the elderly aged 65 and over, and the sex ratio was in favor of men. Between 52% and 59% of EPTB cases were lymphadenitis TB and between 15% and 23% were pleural TB. About two-third of EPTB cases were females and around 10% were children under the age of 15.

We aim to investigate the prevalence and age pattern of viral co-infection in children hospitalized with lower tract acute respiratory infection (LT-ARI), using molecular techniques. METHODS: A nested polymerase chain reaction approach was used to detect Influenza (A, B), metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza (1–4), rhinovirus, adenovirus (A—F), bocavirus and coronaviruses (NL63, 229E, OC43) in respiratory samples of children with acute respiratory infection prospectively admitted to any of the GENDRES network hospitals between 2011–2013. The results were corroborated in an independent cohort collected in the UK. RESULTS: A total of 204 and 97 nasopharyngeal samples were collected in the GENDRES and UK cohorts, respectively. In both cohorts, RSV was the most frequent pathogen (52.9% and 36.1% of the cohorts, respectively).

Further, there is no prioritized research agenda to address these gaps. We used a Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) process to identify priority research questions in response to these evidence gaps. CHNRI is a consultative approach that entails prioritizing research questions by evaluating them against standardized criteria. METHODS: We engaged geographically and occupationally diverse experts in the private health sector and child health. Eighty-nine experts agreed to participate and provided 150 priority research questions. We consolidated submitted questions to reduce duplication into a final list of 50. We asked participants to complete an online survey to rank each question against 11 pre-determined criteria in four categories: (i) answerability, (ii) research feasibility, (iii) sustainability/equity, and (iv) importance/potential impact. Statistical data analysis was conducted in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary NC, USA). We weighted all 11 evaluation criteria equally to calculate the research priority score and average expert agreement for each question. We disaggregated results by location in high-income vs low- and middle-income countries. RESULTS: Forty-nine participants (55.1%) completed the online survey, including 33 high-income and 16 low- and middle-income country respondents. The top, prioritized research question asks whether accreditation or regulation of private clinical and non-clinical sources of care would improve integrated management of childhood illness services. Four of the top ten research priorities were related to adherence to case management protocols. Other top research priorities were related to training and supportive supervision, digital health, and infant and newborn care. Research priorities among high-income and low- and middle-income country respondents were highly correlated. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first systematic exercise conducted to define research priorities for the management of childhood illness in the private sector. The research priorities put forth in this CHNRI exercise aim to stimulate interest from policy makers, program managers, researchers, and donors to respond to and help close evidence gaps hindering the acceleration of reductions in child mortality through private sector approaches.","Clarence, Catherine; Shiras, Tess; Zhu, Jack; Boggs, Malia K; Faltas, Nefra; Wadsworth, Anna; Bradley, Sarah EK; Sadruddin, Salim; Wazny, Kerri; Goodman, Catherine; Awor, Phyllis; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A; Källander, Karin; Hamer, Davidson H",Journal of global health,72,6

These diseases cause significant losses within the pork industry and within the first year after PEDV introduction, approximately 10% of the US herd died due to the disease. Similar to other enteric coronaviruses, such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), these emerging swine enteric coronavirus diseases (SECD) are age‐dependent, with high morbidity and mortality in neonatal pigs. Since the introduction of SECD, research has focused on investigating viral pathogenesis through experimental inoculation, increasing maternal antibody for neonatal protection, understanding transmission risks through feed and transportation, and outlining the importance of biosecurity in preventing SECD introduction and spread. A survey of swine professionals conducted for this review revealed that the majority of respondents (75%) believe SECD can be eradicated and that most herds have been successful at long‐term elimination of SECD after exposure (80%). However, unique properties of SECD, such as ineffective immunity through parenteral vaccination and a low oral infectious dose, play a major role in management of SECD. This review serves to describe the current knowledge of SECD and the characteristics of these viruses which provide both opportunities and challenges for long‐term disease control and potential eradication from the US swine population.","Niederwerder, M.

This study examined the trends and impacts of coastal flooding in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Making use of archival climate data and primary data from key informants and field observations, it emerged that there is a statistically significant increase in the frequency of flooding and consequent human and economic losses from such in the coastal cities of the province. Flooding in urban areas of the Western Cape is a factor of human and natural factors ranging from extreme rainfall, usually caused by persistent cut off-lows, midlatitude cyclones, cold fronts and intense storms. Such floods become compounded by poor drainage caused by vegetative overgrowth on waterways and land pollution that can be traced to poor drainage maintenance. Clogging of waterways and drainage systems enhances the risk of flooding. Increased urbanisation, overpopulation in some areas and non-adherence to environmental laws results in both the affluent and poor settling on vulnerable ecosystems. These include coastal areas, estuaries, and waterways, and this worsens the risk of flooding. The study recommends a comprehensive approach to deal with factors that increase the risk of flooding as informed by the provisions of both the Sustainable Development Goals framework and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030 in a bid to de-risking human settlement in South Africa.","Dube, Kaitano; Nhamo, Godwell; Chikodzi, David",GeoJournal,72,10

However, most of the published panels involve multiple genes, which is problematic in clinical settings because polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technology is the most widely used genomic technology in these settings, and it can only be used to measure a small number of targets. This study aimed to identify a single-gene biomarker with a high diagnostic accuracy by using integrated bioinformatics analysis with XGBoost. The gene expression profiles in dataset GSE68310 were used to construct a co-expression network using weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Fourteen hub genes related to influenza infection (blue module) that were common to both the co-expression network and the protein–protein interaction network were identified. Thereafter, a single hub gene was selected using XGBoost, with feature selection conducted using recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV). The identified biomarker was oligoadenylate synthetases-like (OASL). The robustness of this biomarker was further examined using three external datasets. OASL expression profiling triggered by various infections was different enough to discriminate between influenza and non-influenza ARI infections. Thus, this study presented a workflow to identify a single-gene classifier across multiple datasets. Moreover, OASL was revealed as a biomarker that could identify influenza patients from among those with flu-like ARI. OASL has great potential for improving influenza diagnosis accuracy in ARI patients in the clinical setting.","Li, Yang; Liu, Hongjie; Xu, Quan; Wu, Rui; Zhang, Yi; Li, Naizhe; He, Xiaozhou; Yang, Mengjie; Liang, Mifang; Ma, Xuejun",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,72,16

Controlling and predicting climatic factors are difficult and require expensive solutions. The study focuses on identifying issues other than climatic factors using the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) to measure agricultural vulnerability. Factors such as monthly savings of the farmers, income opportunities, damage to cultivable lands, and water availability had significant impacts on increasing community vulnerability with regards to agricultural practice. The study also identified the need for assessing vulnerability after certain intervals, specifically owing to the dynamic nature of the coastal region where the factors were found to vary among the different study areas. The development of a climate-resilient livelihood vulnerability assessment tool to detect the most significant factors to assess agricultural vulnerability was done using machine learning (ML) techniques. The ML techniques identified nine significant factors out of 21 based on the minimum level of standard deviation (0.03). A practical application of the outcome of the study was the development of a mobile application. Custom REST APIs (application programming interface) were developed on the backend to seamlessly sync the app to a server, thus ensuring the acquisition of future data without much effort and resources. The paper provides a methodology for a unique vulnerability assessment technique using a mobile application, which can be used for the planning and management of resources by different stakeholders in a sustainable way.","Jakariya, Md.; Alam, Md.

The paired CD4 conserved residues, including the matched CD4 interacting MHC-II epitopes of the structural viral protein domains, were chosen for the protein modelling using the SWISS-MODEL online server. Energy minimization and structural validation of the modelled viral protein domains, including the CD4 and MHC-II protein were achieved by CHIMERA and PROCHECK-Ramachandran Plot respectively. Protein-protein docking was performed by the HADDOCK online tool. The binding affinity score was measured using the PRODIGY online server. As per our docking report, the Env gp120 of HIV-1 with three identical and three conserved residues of CD4 exhibited the highest binding affinity (−13.9 kcal/mol) with MHC-II than the second-highest RBD-S1-SARS-CoV-2 (−12.5 kcal/mol) with three identical and a single conserved residue of CD4. With a noticeable single salt bridge formation identified at the interacting residues Lys305 (of Env gp120-HIV-1) and Glu139 (of MHC-II); the Env gp120 interaction with MHC-II occupied the crucial His144 and Glu194 (salt-bridge) interacting residues of CD4 with the measured buried surface area 2554.8±40.8 Å2. Similarly, the RBD-S1-SARS-CoV-2-MHC-II complex showed two salt bridge formations at the residue sites: 1) Arg567 (of SARS-CoV-2)-Glu194 (of MHC-II) 2) 2) Asp568(of SARS-CoV-2)-Arg165 (of MHC-II) with the increased buried surface area of 1910.9±97.1 Å2 over the SARS-CoV score 1708.2±50.8 Å2; that camouflaged all crucial CD4 interacting residues of MHC-II. In conclusion, the noticeable conserved residues of CD4 at the RBD-S1 sites of SARS-CoV-2 could interrupt the aspired CD4-MHC-II interactions of adaptive immune activation.","C, Selvaa Kumar; Kumar, Senthil Arun; Dasgupta, Debjani; Wei, Haiyan",bioRxiv,72,16

The primary objective of this study was to examine the hepatic damage in 2019-nCoV infected patients and the associated underlying causes. METHODS: In this retrospective study, a total of 68 laboratory-confirmed and 20 suspected COVID-19 cases from 23(rd) January 2020 to 15(th) February 2020 were included. The study was conducted in The First People’s Hospital of Jingzhou, Hubei. SPSS version 23.0. was used for Statistical analysis using the Student’s t-test or Chi-square test. Data was analyzed for the clinical characteristics and underlying causes of liver damage. The outcomes were followed up until March 29, 2020. RESULTS: Out of the 68 COVID-19 confirmed cases, 51 had an abnormal liver function, of which 15 had an abnormal liver function at the time of hospital admission. The relationship between the liver function and clinical prognosis of patients showed that the abnormal liver function was positively correlated with the severity of the infection (100% vs.70.2%, p=0.036). The proportion of patients with an elevated level of ALT and a depleted level of Albumin (ALB) were significantly lower in the COVID-19 suspected group than the confirmed group (5% vs. 50.9%, p=0.000; 10% vs. 35.8%, p=0.030, respectively). Besides, the utilization rate of lopinavir/ritonavir, azithromycin, and methylprednisolone in COVID-19 suspected patients were significantly lower than the confirmed patients (25% vs. 62.3%, p=0.004; 35% vs. 62.3%, p=0.037; 25% vs. 64.2%, p=0.003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Liver function anomalies are one of the common symptoms associated with the COVID-19 infection, where virus-replication in the liver cells, virus-induced inflammatory response, and administration of clinical medication could be the plausible reason.","Zuo, Guojin; Liu, Weirong",Pak J Med Sci,72,1

The study of these processes has led to the identification of a number of proteins that mediate this process. These proteins are classified according to their structure, which vary according to the viral genealogy. To date, three classes of fusion proteins have been defined, but current evidence points to the existence of additional classes. Despite their structural differences, viral fusion processes follow a common mechanism through which they exert their actions. Additional studies of the viral fusion proteins have demonstrated the key role of specific proteinogenic subsequences within these proteins, termed fusion peptides. Such peptides are able to interact and insert into membranes for which they hold interest from a pharmacological or therapeutic viewpoint. Here, the different characteristics of fusion peptides derived from viral fusion proteins are described. These criteria are useful to identify new fusion peptides. Moreover, this review describes the requirements of synthetic fusion peptides derived from fusion proteins to induce fusion by themselves. Several sequences of the viral glycoproteins E1 and E2 of HCV were, for example, identified to be able to induce fusion, which are reviewed here.","Lozada, Camille; Barlow, Thomas M.

Hence, we devised a multiplex reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (mRT-LAMP) coupled with a nanoparticle-based lateral flow biosensor (LFB) assay (mRT-LAMP-LFB) for diagnosing COVID-19. Using two LAMP primer sets, the ORF1ab (opening reading frame 1a/b) and N (nucleoprotein) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were simultaneously amplified in a single-tube reaction, and detected with the diagnosis results easily interpreted by LFB. In presence of FITC (fluorescein)-/digoxin- and biotin-labeled primers, mRT-LAMP produced numerous FITC-/digoxin- and biotin-attached duplex amplicons, which were determined by LFB through immunoreactions (FITC/digoxin on the duplex and anti-FITC/digoxin on the test line of LFB) and biotin/treptavidin interaction (biotin on the duplex and strptavidin on the polymerase nanoparticle). The accumulation of nanoparticles leaded a characteristic crimson band, enabling multiplex analysis of ORF1ab and N gene without instrumentation. The limit of detection (LoD) of COVID-19 mRT-LAMP-LFB was 12 copies (for each detection target) per reaction, and no cross-reactivity was generated from non-SARS-CoV-2 templates. The analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 was 100% (33/33 oropharynx swab samples collected from COVID-19 patients), and the assay's specificity was also 100% (96/96 oropharynx swab samples collected from non-COVID-19 patients). The total diagnostic test can be completed within 1 h from sample collection to result interpretation. In sum, the COVID-19 mRT-LAMP-LFB assay is a promising tool for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections in frontline public health field and clinical laboratories, especially from resource-poor regions.","Zhu, Xiong; Wang, Xiaoxia; Han, Limei; Chen, Ting; Wang, Licheng; Li, Huan; Li, Sha; He, Lvfen; Fu, Xiaoying; Chen, Shaojin; Xing, Mei; Chen, Hai; Wang, Yi",Biosens Bioelectron,72,4

Most formula products lack HMOs or contain only the most abundant HMO, 2′-fucosyllactose; however, benefits of HMOs come from multiple sugars. We therefore developed a mixture of five HMOs (5HMO-Mix) mimicking the natural concentrations of the top five HMOs (5.75 g/L total, comprising 52% 2′-fucosyllactose, 13% 3-fucosyllactose, 26% lacto-N-tetraose, 4% 3′-sialyllactose, and 5% 6′-sialyllactose) representing the groups of neutral, neutral-fucosylated, and sialylated HMOs. We conducted the first multicenter, randomized, controlled, parallel-group clinical study assessing the safety, tolerability, and effect on growth of formula containing the 5HMO-Mix in healthy infants. We enrolled 341 subjects aged ≤14 days; 225 were randomized into groups fed either with infant formula containing 5HMO-Mix (5HMO-Mix) or infant formula without HMOs (IF) for 4 months, with the others exclusively breastfed. There were no differences in weight, length, or head circumference gain between the two formula groups. The 5HMO-Mix was well tolerated, with 5HMO-Mix and breastfed infants producing softer stools at a higher stool frequency than the control formula group. Adverse events were equivalent in all groups. We conclude that the 5HMO-Mix at 5.75 g/L in infant formula is safe and well tolerated by healthy term infants during the first months of life.","Parschat, Katja; Melsaether, Cathrine; Jäpelt, Kristina Rasch; Jennewein, Stefan",Nutrients,72,1

OBJECTIVE: Assess how mental health changed from before to after the November 2016 election and how trends differed in states that voted for Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton. DESIGN: Pre- versus post-election study using monthly cross-sectional survey data. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 499,201 adults surveyed in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System from May 2016 to May 2017. EXPOSURE: Residence in a state that voted for Trump versus state that voted for Clinton and the candidate’s margin of victory in the state. MAIN MEASURES: Self-reported days of poor mental health in the last 30 days and depression rate. KEY RESULTS: Compared to October 2016, the mean days of poor mental health in the last 30 days per adult rose from 3.35 to 3.85 in December 2016 in Clinton states (0.50 days difference, p = 0.005) but remained statistically unchanged in Trump states, moving from 3.94 to 3.78 days (− 0.17 difference, p = 0.308). The rises in poor mental health days in Clinton states were driven by older adults, women, and white individuals. The depression rate in Clinton states began rising in January 2017. A 10–percentage point higher margin of victory for Clinton in a state predicted 0.41 more days of poor mental health per adult in December 2016 on average (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In states that voted for Clinton, there were 54.6 million more days of poor mental health among adults in December 2016, the month following the election, compared to October 2016.

The aim of the study was to assess patients from a private practice and the university outpatient department with respect to patient satisfaction with telemedicine, COVID-19 worries and vaccination behavior and to compare the teleconsultation by a medical assistant for rheumatology (RFA) and a physician. METHODS: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatric arthropathy or spondylarthritis without treatment modifications since the previous presentation were offered a telemedical replacement appointment within the framework of this study in the case of appointment cancellation by the treating center. Participants were randomized to a telemedicine appointment by a physician or an RFA (RFA university only). The patient history was carried out by telephone and standardized using a questionnaire. The disease activity was determined using the modified clinical disease activity score (CDAI) and the BASDAI. Subsequently, all patients received a pseudonymized evaluation questionnaire. RESULTS: In total 112/116 (96%) patients participated. Of these 88/112 (79%) returned the questionnaire. The RFAs conducted 19/112 (17%) of the telephone calls. The treatment was modified in 19/112 (17%) patients. Concerns about contracting COVID-19 correlated with high disease activity (p = 0.031) including the presence of painful joints (p = 0.001) and high pain levels (VAS ≥7, p = 0.009). These patients would have also cancelled their appointment themselves (p = 0.015). Patient satisfaction with the consultation was good (mean 4.3/5.0 modified FAPI) independent of the institution, the duration of the consultation and the consultation partner. Patients with a high pain intensity were the least satisfied (p = 0.036). Only 42/100 (38.2%) of the patients had been vaccinated against pneumococci and 59/100 (53.6%) against influenza.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 3018 subjects attended at two public hospitals in Madrid (Spain) with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from January 31 to April 17, 2020. Patients with eosinophil counts less than 0.02×10(9)/L were considered to have eosinopenia. Individuals with chronic respiratory diseases (n=384) were classified according to their particular underlying condition, i.e., asthma, chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, or obstructive sleep apnea. RESULTS: Of the 3018 patients enrolled, 479 were excluded because of lack of information at the time of admission. Of 2539 subjects assessed, 1396 patients presented an eosinophil count performed on admission, revealing eosinopenia in 376 cases (26.93%).

However, data on the exposure and impact of misinformation is not readily available. OBJECTIVE: We aim to characterize and compare the start, peak, and doubling time of COVID-19 misinformation topics across 8 countries using an exponential growth model usually employed to study infectious disease epidemics. METHODS: COVID-19 misinformation topics were selected from the World Health Organization Mythbusters website. Data representing exposure was obtained from the Google Trends application programming interface for 8 English-speaking countries. Exponential growth models were used in modeling trends for each country. RESULTS: Searches for “coronavirus AND 5G” started at different times but peaked in the same week for 6 countries. Searches for 5G also had the shortest doubling time across all misinformation topics, with the shortest time in Nigeria and South Africa (approximately 4-5 days). Searches for “coronavirus AND ginger” started at the same time (the week of January 19, 2020) for several countries, but peaks were incongruent, and searches did not always grow exponentially after the initial week. Searches for “coronavirus AND sun” had different start times across countries but peaked at the same time for multiple countries. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns in the start, peak, and doubling time for “coronavirus AND 5G” were different from the other misinformation topics and were mostly consistent across countries assessed, which might be attributable to a lack of public understanding of 5G technology. Understanding the spread of misinformation, similarities and differences across different contexts can help in the development of appropriate interventions for limiting its impact similar to how we address infectious disease epidemics. Furthermore, the rapid proliferation of misinformation that discourages adherence to public health interventions could be predictive of future increases in disease cases.","Nsoesie, Elaine Okanyene; Cesare, Nina; Müller, Martin; Ozonoff, Al",J Med Internet Res,72,16

Clinical trials of vaccines and drugs are currently being conducted around the world; however, till now no effective drug is available for COVID-19. Identification of key genes and perturbed pathways in COVID-19 may uncover potential drug targets and biomarkers. We aimed to identify key gene modules and hub targets involved in COVID-19. We have analyzed SARS-CoV-2 infected peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) transcriptomic data through gene coexpression analysis. We identified 1520 and 1733 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the GSE152418 and CRA002390 PBMC datasets, respectively (FDR < 0.05). We found four key gene modules and hub gene signature based on module membership (MMhub) statistics and protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks (PPIhub). Functional annotation by enrichment analysis of the genes of these modules demonstrated immune and inflammatory response biological processes enriched by the DEGs. The pathway analysis revealed the hub genes were enriched with the IL-17 signaling pathway, cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction pathways. Then, we demonstrated the classification performance of hub genes (PLK1, AURKB, AURKA, CDK1, CDC20, KIF11, CCNB1, KIF2C, DTL and CDC6) with accuracy >0.90 suggesting the biomarker potential of the hub genes. The regulatory network analysis showed transcription factors and microRNAs that target these hub genes.

The identified biomarkers and pathways might be therapeutic targets to the COVID-19.","Auwul, Md Rabiul; Rahman, Md Rezanur; Gov, Esra; Shahjaman, Md; Moni, Mohammad Ali",Brief Bioinform,72,17

To date, there is a paucity of data as to the impact of the revised definitions on clinical trials. METHODS: In this study, we sought to determine the impact of the new definitions on classifying invasive aspergillosis (IA), the most common invasive mold disease in immunocompromised patients. We reclassified 226 proven and probable IA cases plus 139 possible IFD cases in the Aspergillus Technology Consortium (AsTeC) and in an antifungal prophylaxis trial (BMT CTN 0101) using the new criteria. RESULTS: Fewer cases met the more stringent diagnostic 2020 criteria after applying the reclassification criteria to define probable IA. Of 188 evaluable probable cases, 41 (22%) were reclassified to 40 possible IA and 1 probable IFD. Reclassification to possible IFD occurred in 22% of hematologic malignancy (HM) patients, 29% of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patients, and in no lung transplant (LT) patients. Date of diagnosis was established a median (range) of 3 (1–105) days later in 15% of probable IA cases using the new criteria. Applying the new definitions to the BMT CTN 0101 trial, the power to detect the same odds ratio decreased substantially. CONCLUSIONS: The updated IA consensus definitions may impact future trial designs, especially for antifungal prophylaxis studies.","Wingard, John R; Alexander, Barbara D; Baden, Lindsey R; Chen, Min; Sugrue, Michele W; Leather, Helen L; Caliendo, Angela M; Clancy, Cornelius J; Denning, David W; Marty, Francisco M; Nguyen, M Hong; Wheat, L Joseph; Logan, Brent R; Horowitz, Mary M; Marr, Kieren A",Open Forum Infect Dis,72,24

SARS-CoV-2 infection is definitively diagnosed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) typically using nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, and less commonly, samples from the lower respiratory tract, including bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In highly prevalent regions, stepwise evaluation, and management, as in the pre-COVID era, risks false-negatives and delay in therapy for COVID-19.","Chhabra, Saurabh; Abedin, Sameem; Graham, Mary Beth; Marrero, Tirsa M.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey study of parents of children with CHD, children and young people, capturing experiences, decision-making, information, and support needs during the COVID-19 crisis was conducted. The survey launched for one month (April 9, 2020) during the first infection wave in the United Kingdom and subsequent restriction of free movement under lockdown rules from March 23, 2020, until May 31, 2020. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-four parents and 36 children/young people completed the survey. Parents were more likely to worry about the virus (86.4%) than children/young people (69.4%), while (89%) parents were more vigilant for symptoms of the virus versus children/young people (69.4%). A thematic analysis of the qualitative comments covered 34 subthemes, forming eight overarching themes: Virus-(1) risk of infection; (2)information, guidance, and advice; (3) change in health care provision; and (4) fears and anxieties, and lockdown and isolation-(5) psychological and social impact, (6) keeping safe under lockdown, (7) provisions and dependence on others, and (8) employment and income. CONCLUSIONS: There was widespread concern over the virus especially among parents. Parents and children/young people, however, were frustrated with the lack of specific and pediatric-focused information and guidance, expressing disappointment with the adult-centric information available. Parents also felt alone, especially with their concerns around the implications of cardiac service suspension and the implication for their child's health. In order to better support children and their families, resources need to be developed to address families' and children/young people's concerns for their health during this pandemic.","Marino, L V; Wagland, R; Culliford, D J; Bharucha, T; Sodergren, S C; Darlington, Anne-Sophie E",World J Pediatr Congenit Heart Surg,72,1
