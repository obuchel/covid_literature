40,40,40,Evaluation of potential reference genes in real-time RT-PCR studies of Atlantic salmon,10.8803215,8.508437,2005-11-17,"BACKGROUND: Salmonid fishes are among the most widely studied model fish species but reports on systematic evaluation of reference genes in qRT-PCR studies is lacking. RESULTS: The stability of six potential reference genes was examined in eight tissues of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), to determine the most suitable genes to be used in quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses. The relative transcription levels of genes encoding 18S rRNA, S20 ribosomal protein, β-actin, glyceraldehyde-3P-dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and two paralog genes encoding elongation factor 1A (EF1A(A )and EF1A(B)) were quantified in gills, liver, head kidney, spleen, thymus, brain, muscle, and posterior intestine in six untreated adult fish, in addition to a group of individuals that went through smoltification. Based on calculations performed with the geNorm VBA applet, which determines the most stable genes from a set of tested genes in a given cDNA sample, the ranking of the examined genes in adult Atlantic salmon was EF1A(B)>EF1A(A)>β-actin>18S rRNA>S20>GAPDH. When the same calculations were done on a total of 24 individuals from four stages in the smoltification process (presmolt, smolt, smoltified seawater and desmoltified freshwater), the gene ranking was EF1A(B)>EF1A(A)>S20>β-actin>18S rRNA>GAPDH. CONCLUSION: Overall, this work suggests that the EF1A(A )and EF1A(B )genes can be useful as reference genes in qRT-PCR examination of gene expression in the Atlantic salmon.","Olsvik, Pål A; Lie, Kai K; Jordal, Ann-Elise O; Nilsen, Tom O; Hordvik, Ivar",BMC Mol Biol,32,1
227,227,227,Multivalent HA DNA Vaccination Protects against Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Avian Influenza Infection in Chickens and Mice,10.844365,8.409021,2008-06-18,"BACKGROUND: Sustained outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 in avian species increase the risk of reassortment and adaptation to humans. The ability to contain its spread in chickens would reduce this threat and help maintain the capacity for egg-based vaccine production. While vaccines offer the potential to control avian disease, a major concern of current vaccines is their potency and inability to protect against evolving avian influenza viruses. METHODOLOGY / PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The ability of DNA vaccines encoding hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from different HPAI H5N1 serotypes was evaluated for its ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies and to protect against homologous and heterologous HPAI H5N1 strain challenge in mice and chickens after DNA immunization by needle and syringe or with a pressure injection device. These vaccines elicited antibodies that neutralized multiple strains of HPAI H5N1 when given in combinations containing up to 10 HAs. The response was dose-dependent, and breadth was determined by the choice of the influenza virus HA in the vaccine. Monovalent and trivalent HA vaccines were tested first in mice and conferred protection against lethal H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 challenge 68 weeks after vaccination. In chickens, protection was observed against heterologous strains of HPAI H5N1 after vaccination with a trivalent H5 serotype DNA vaccine with doses as low as 5 µg DNA given twice either by intramuscular needle injection or with a needle-free device. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: DNA vaccines offer a generic approach to influenza virus immunization applicable to multiple animal species. In addition, the ability to substitute plasmids encoding different strains enables rapid adaptation of the vaccine to newly evolving field isolates.","Rao, Srinivas; Kong, Wing-Pui; Wei, Chih-Jen; Yang, Zhi-Yong; Nason, Martha; Styles, Darrel; DeTolla, Louis J.; Sorrell, Erin M.; Song, Haichen; Wan, Hongquan; Ramirez-Nieto, Gloria C.; Perez, Daniel; Nabel, Gary J.",PLoS One,32,1

Here, the results of an active surveillance effort focusing on the live-bird markets are presented. Prevalence of influenza infection in the birds of the live bird markets is 23.0%, which is similar to that in poultry markets in other countries. Nearly all of the isolates (94%) were of the non-pathogenic H9N2 subtype, but viruses of the H1N2, H1N3, H3N6, H4N2, H5N1, and H10N7 subtypes were also observed. The highly pathogenic H5N1-subtype virus was observed at extremely low prevalence in the surveillance samples (0.08%), and we suggest that the current risk of infection for humans in the retail poultry markets in Bangladesh is negligible. However, the high prevalence of the H9 subtype and its potential for interaction with the highly pathogenic H5N1-subtype, i.e., reassortment and attenuation of host morbidity, highlight the importance of active surveillance of the poultry markets.","Negovetich, Nicholas J.; Feeroz, Mohammed M.; Jones-Engel, Lisa; Walker, David; Alam, S.

695,695,695,Evaluation of Internal Reference Genes for Quantitative Expression Analysis by Real-Time PCR in Ovine Whole Blood,11.120828,8.246192,2011-11-09,"The use of reference genes is commonly accepted as the most reliable approach to normalize qRT-PCR and to reduce possible errors in the quantification of gene expression. The most suitable reference genes in sheep have been identified for a restricted range of tissues, but no specific data on whole blood are available. The aim of this study was to identify a set of reference genes for normalizing qRT-PCR from ovine whole blood. We designed 11 PCR assays for commonly employed reference genes belonging to various functional classes and then determined their expression stability in whole blood samples from control and disease-stressed sheep. SDHA and YWHAZ were considered the most suitable internal controls as they were stably expressed regardless of disease status according to both geNorm and NormFinder software; furthermore, geNorm indicated SDHA/HPRT, YWHAZ/GAPDH and SDHA/YWHAZ as the best reference gene combinations in control, disease-stressed and combined sheep groups, respectively. Our study provides a validated panel of optimal control genes which may be useful for the identification of genes differentially expressed by qRT-PCR in a readily accessible tissue, with potential for discovering new physiological and disease markers and as a tool to improve production traits (e.g., by identifying expression Quantitative Trait Loci). An additional outcome of the study is a set of intron-spanning primer sequences suitable for gene expression experiments employing SYBR Green chemistry on other ovine tissues and cells.","Peletto, Simone; Bertuzzi, Simone; Campanella, Chiara; Modesto, Paola; Maniaci, Maria Grazia; Bellino, Claudio; Ariello, Dario; Quasso, Antonio; Caramelli, Maria; Acutis, Pier Luigi",Int J Mol Sci,32,1
806,806,806,A Non-VH1-69 Heterosubtypic Neutralizing Human Monoclonal Antibody Protects Mice against H1N1 and H5N1 Viruses,10.911169,8.595318,2012-04-04,"Influenza viruses are among the most important human pathogens and are responsible for annual epidemics and sporadic, potentially devastating pandemics. The humoral immune response plays an important role in the defense against these viruses, providing protection mainly by producing antibodies directed against the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein. However, their high genetic variability allows the virus to evade the host immune response and the potential protection offered by seasonal vaccines. The emergence of resistance to antiviral drugs in recent years further limits the options available for the control of influenza. The development of alternative strategies for influenza prophylaxis and therapy is therefore urgently needed. In this study, we describe a human monoclonal antibody (PN-SIA49) that recognizes a highly conserved epitope located on the stem region of the HA and able to neutralize a broad spectrum of influenza viruses belonging to different subtypes (H1, H2 and H5). Furthermore, we describe its protective activity in mice after lethal challenge with H1N1 and H5N1 viruses suggesting a potential application in the treatment of influenza virus infections.","De Marco, Donata; Clementi, Nicola; Mancini, Nicasio; Solforosi, Laura; Moreno, Guisella J.; Sun, Xiangjie; Tumpey, Terrence M.; Gubareva, Larisa V.; Mishin, Vasiliy; Clementi, Massimo; Burioni, Roberto",PLoS One,32,11

A prominent family of ISGs is the interferon-induced with tetratricopeptide repeats (Ifit) genes comprising three members in mice, Ifit1/ISG56, Ifit2/ISG54 and Ifit3/ISG49. Intranasal infection with a low dose of VSV is not lethal to wild-type mice and all three Ifit genes are induced in the central nervous system of the infected mice. We tested their potential contributions to the observed protection of wild-type mice from VSV pathogenesis, by taking advantage of the newly generated knockout mice lacking either Ifit2 or Ifit1. We observed that in Ifit2 knockout (Ifit2 (−/−)) mice, intranasal VSV infection was uniformly lethal and death was preceded by neurological signs, such as ataxia and hind limb paralysis. In contrast, wild-type and Ifit1 (−/−) mice were highly protected and survived without developing such disease. However, when VSV was injected intracranially, virus replication and survival were not significantly different between wild-type and Ifit2(−/−) mice. When administered intranasally, VSV entered the central nervous system through the olfactory bulbs, where it replicated equivalently in wild-type and Ifit2 (−/−) mice and induced interferon-β. However, as the infection spread to other regions of the brain, VSV titers rose several hundred folds higher in Ifit2 (−/−) mice as compared to wild-type mice. This was not caused by a broadened cell tropism in the brains of Ifit2 (−/−) mice, where VSV still replicated selectively in neurons. Surprisingly, this advantage for VSV replication in the brains of Ifit2(−/−) mice was not observed in other organs, such as lung and liver. Pathogenesis by another neurotropic RNA virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, was not enhanced in the brains of Ifit2 (−/−) mice. Our study provides a clear demonstration of tissue-, virus- and ISG-specific antiviral action of interferon.","Fensterl, Volker; Wetzel, Jaime L.; Ramachandran, Srividya; Ogino, Tomoaki; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Bergmann, Cornelia C.; Diamond, Michael S.; Virgin, Herbert W.; Sen, Ganes C.",PLoS Pathog,32,1
856,856,856,Identifying Live Bird Markets with the Potential to Act as Reservoirs of Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus: A Survey in Northern Viet Nam and Cambodia,11.185724,8.530656,2012-06-04,"Wet markets are common in many parts of the world and may promote the emergence, spread and maintenance of livestock pathogens, including zoonoses. A survey was conducted in order to assess the potential of Vietnamese and Cambodian live bird markets (LBMs) to sustain circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 (HPAIV H5N1). Thirty Vietnamese and 8 Cambodian LBMs were visited, and structured interviews were conducted with the market managers and 561 Vietnamese and 84 Cambodian traders. Multivariate and cluster analysis were used to construct a typology of traders based on their poultry management practices. As a result of those practices and large poultry surplus (unsold poultry reoffered for sale the following day), some poultry traders were shown to promote conditions favorable for perpetuating HPAIV H5N1 in LBMs. More than 80% of these traders operated in LBMs located in the most densely populated areas, Ha Noi and Phnom Penh. The profiles of sellers operating at a given LBM could be reliably predicted using basic information about the location and type of market. Consequently, LBMs with the largest combination of risk factors for becoming virus reservoirs could be easily identified, potentially allowing control strategies to be appropriately targeted. These findings are of particular relevance to resource-scarce settings with extensively developed LBM systems, commonly found in South-East Asia.","Fournié, Guillaume; Guitian, Javier; Desvaux, Stéphanie; Mangtani, Punam; Ly, Sowath; Cong, Vu Chi; San, Sorn; Dung, Do Huu; Holl, Davun; Pfeiffer, Dirk U.; Vong, Sirenda; Ghani, Azra C.",PLoS One,32,28

As a result, we have gained detailed mechanistic knowledge on enzymatic removal of tRNA introns catalyzed by endonuclease and ligase proteins. In addition to the elucidation of tRNA processing, these studies facilitated the discovery of additional functions of RNA ligases such as RNA repair and non-conventional mRNA splicing events. Recently, the identification of a new type of RNA ligases in bacteria, archaea, and humans closed a long-standing gap in the field of tRNA processing. This review summarizes past and recent findings in the field of tRNA splicing with a focus on RNA ligation as it preferentially occurs in archaea and humans.

FINDINGS: We developed a real-time PCR array capable of simultaneously detecting eight human viral pathogens: human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and -2), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human T-cell leukemia virus-1 and -2 (HTLV-1 and -2), vaccinia virus (VACV) and West Nile virus (WNV). One hundred twenty (120) primers were designed using a combination of bioinformatics approaches, and, after experimental testing, 24 primer sets targeting eight viral pathogens were selected to set up the array with SYBR Green chemistry. The specificity and sensitivity of the virus-specific primer sets selected for the array were evaluated using analytical panels with known amounts of viruses spiked into human plasma. The array detected: 10 genome equivalents (geq)/ml of HIV-2 and HCV, 50 geq of HIV-1 (subtype B), HBV (genotype A) and WNV. It detected 100–1,000 geq/ml of plasma of HIV-1 subtypes (A – G), group N and CRF (AE and AG) isolates. Further evaluation with a panel consisting of 28 HIV-1 and HIV-2 clinical isolates revealed no cross-reactivity of HIV-1 or HIV-2 specific primers with another type of HIV. All 28 viral isolates were identified with specific primer sets targeting the most conserved genome areas. The PCR array correctly identified viral infections in a panel of 17 previously quantified clinical plasma samples positive for HIV-1, HCV or HBV at as low as several geq per PCR reaction. CONCLUSIONS: The viral array described here demonstrated adequate performance in the testing of donors’ clinical samples. Further improvement in its sensitivity for the broad spectrum of HIV-1 subtypes is under development.","Pripuzova, Natalia; Wang, Richard; Tsai, Shien; Li, Bingjie; Hung, Guo-Chiuan; Ptak, Roger G.; Lo, Shyh-Ching",PLoS One,32,11
994,994,994,Chitinase Dependent Control of Protozoan Cyst Burden in the Brain,11.116318,8.331749,2012-11-29,"Chronic infections represent a continuous battle between the host's immune system and pathogen replication. Many protozoan parasites have evolved a cyst lifecycle stage that provides it with increased protection from environmental degradation as well as endogenous host mechanisms of attack. In the case of Toxoplasma gondii, these cysts are predominantly found in the immune protected brain making clearance of the parasite more difficult and resulting in a lifelong infection. Currently, little is known about the nature of the immune response stimulated by the presence of these cysts or how they are able to propagate. Here we establish a novel chitinase-dependent mechanism of cyst control in the infected brain. Despite a dominant Th1 immune response during Toxoplasma infection there exists a population of alternatively activated macrophages (AAMØ) in the infected CNS. These cells are capable of cyst lysis via the production of AMCase as revealed by live imaging, and this chitinase is necessary for protective immunity within the CNS. These data demonstrate chitinase activity in the brain in response to a protozoan pathogen and provide a novel mechanism to facilitate cyst clearance during chronic infections.","Nance, J.

A series of different recombinant HCV proteins in Escherichia coli cells were constructed, expressed, purified and the new DAS-LFIA strip was developed. The sensitivity and specificity of new the DAS-LFIA strip were evaluated by detecting 23 HCV-positive sera, a set of quality control references for anti-HCV detection that contain known amounts of anti-HCV antibodies, and 8 HCV-negative sera. A total of 300 clinical serum samples was examined by both the new DAS-LFIA strip and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Data were analyzed using SPSS 11.5 software. The sensitivity and specificity of the new DAS-LFIA strip were 100%. The lowest test line of the HCV DAS-LFIA strips was 2 NCU/ml. Additionally, the concordance between the new DAS-LFIA strip and ELISA methods was 94.33%.

Reports in the literature have indicated that to infect cells the incoming viruses either fuse their envelope directly with the plasma membrane or exploit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. To study the entry process in human tissue culture cells (HeLa, A549), we used fluorescence microscopy and developed quantitative, FACS-based assays to follow virus binding to cells, endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, membrane fusion, and infection. A variety of perturbants were employed to characterize the cellular processes involved. We found that immediately after binding to cells RSV activated a signaling cascade involving the EGF receptor, Cdc42, PAK1, and downstream effectors. This led to a series of dramatic actin rearrangements; the cells rounded up, plasma membrane blebs were formed, and there was a significant increase in fluid uptake. If these effects were inhibited using compounds targeting Na(+)/H(+) exchangers, myosin II, PAK1, and other factors, no infection was observed. The RSV was rapidly and efficiently internalized by an actin-dependent process that had all hallmarks of macropinocytosis. Rather than fusing with the plasma membrane, the viruses thus entered Rab5-positive, fluid-filled macropinosomes, and fused with the membranes of these on the average 50 min after internalization. Rab5 was required for infection. To find an explanation for the endocytosis requirement, which is unusual among paramyxoviruses, we analyzed the fusion protein, F, and could show that, although already cleaved by a furin family protease once, it underwent a second, critical proteolytic cleavage after internalization. This cleavage by a furin-like protease removed a small peptide from the F1 subunits, and made the virus infectious.","Krzyzaniak, Magdalena Anna; Zumstein, Michael Thomas; Gerez, Juan Atilio; Picotti, Paola; Helenius, Ari",PLoS Pathog,32,28

The aim of this study was to evaluate different HRV detection strategies. Samples from adults with acute respiratory infection (n = 291) who were treated in Sao Paulo Hospital (2001-2003) were tested using three assays. The first assay detected picornaviruses by RT-PCR and hybridization, the second detected rhinoviruses using RT-PCR/sequencing, and the third differentiated HRV from HEV using duplex semi-nested-RT-PCR. Analysis of the results obtained from the first two strategies revealed 83% concordance. Discordant samples were then evaluated by the third protocol, and 82% were negative. The picornavirus detection protocol was more sensitive but less specific than the rhinovirus detection protocols. The semi-nested protocol utilized in the present study was less sensitive and was not useful in differentiating HRV from HEV.

Although patient cohort studies have shown the production of CHIKV specific antibodies, the fine specificity of the antibody response against CHIKV is not completely defined. The macaque model of CHIKV infection was established due to limitations of clinical specimens. More importantly, its close relation to humans will allow the study of chronic infection and further identify important CHIKV targets. In this study, serum samples from CHIKV-infected macaques collected at different time-points post infection were used to characterize the antibody production pattern and kinetics. Results revealed that anti-CHIKV antibodies were neutralizing and the E2 glycoprotein, Capsid, nsP1, nsP3 and nsP4 proteins were targets of the anti-CHIKV antibody response in macaques. Furthermore, linear B-cell epitopes recognized by these anti-CHIKV antibodies were identified, and mapped to their structural localization. This characterizes the specificity of anti-CHIKV antibody response in macaques and further demonstrates the importance of the different regions in CHIKV-encoded proteins in the adaptive immune response. Information from this study provides critical knowledge that will aid in the understanding of CHIKV infection and immunity, vaccine design, and pre-clinical efficacy studies.","Kam, Yiu-Wing; Lee, Wendy W.

HIV-1 infected cells show limited Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) responsiveness via as yet unknown mechanisms. Using biochemical and biophysical approaches, we demonstrate that the trans-membrane domain (TMD) of the HIV-1 envelope (ENV) directly interacts with TLR2 TMD within the membrane milieu. This interaction attenuates TNFα, IL-6 and MCP-1 secretion in macrophages, induced by natural ligands of TLR2 both in in vitro and in vivo models. This was associated with decreased levels of ERK phosphorylation. Furthermore, mutagenesis demonstrated the importance of a conserved GxxxG motif in driving this interaction within the membrane milieu. The administration of the ENV TMD in vivo to lipotechoic acid (LTA)/Galactosamine-mediated septic mice resulted in a significant decrease in mortality and in tissue damage, due to the weakening of systemic macrophage activation. Our findings suggest that the TMD of ENV is involved in modulation of the innate immune response during HIV infection. Furthermore, due to the high functional homology of viral ENV proteins this function may be a general character of viral-induced immune modulation.","Reuven, Eliran Moshe; Ali, Mohammad; Rotem, Etai; Schwarzter, Roland; Gramatica, Andrea; Futerman, Anthony H.; Shai, Yechiel",PLoS Pathog,32,1
1997,1997,1997,Development of a rapid recombinase polymerase amplification assay for the detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae in whole blood,11.003438,8.602259,2015-10-29,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important cause of microbial disease in humans. The introduction of multivalent vaccines has coincided with a dramatic decrease in the number of pneumococcal-related deaths. In spite of this, at a global level, pneumococcal infection remains an important cause of death among children under 5 years of age and in adults 65 years of age or older. In order to properly manage patients and control the spread of infection, a rapid and highly sensitive diagnostic method is needed for routine implementation, especially in resource-limited regions where pneumococcal disease is most prevalent. METHODS: Using the gene encoding leader peptidase A as a molecular diagnostics target, a real-time RPA assay was designed and optimised for the detection of S. pneumoniae in whole blood. The performance of the assay was compared to real-time PCR in terms of its analytical limit of detection and specificity. The inhibitory effect of human genomic DNA on amplification was investigated. The potential clinical utility of the assay was investigated using a small number of clinical samples. RESULTS: The RPA assay has a limit of detection equivalent to PCR (4.0 and 5.1 genome equivalents per reaction, respectively) and was capable of detecting the equivalent of <1 colony forming unit of S. pneumoniae when spiked into human whole blood. The RPA assay was 100 % inclusive (38/38 laboratory reference strains and 19/19 invasive clinical isolates) and 100 % exclusive; differentiating strains of S. pneumoniae species from other viridans group streptococci, including S. pseudopneumoniae. When applied to the analysis of a small number (n = 11) of clinical samples (blood culture positive for S. pneumoniae), the RPA assay was demonstrated to be both rapid and sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: The RPA assay developed in this work is shown to be as sensitive and as specific as PCR. In terms of reaction kinetics, the RPA assay is shown to exceed those of the PCR, with the RPA running to completion in 20 minutes and capable generating a positive signal in as little as 6 minutes. This work represents a potentially suitable assay for application in point-of-care settings.","Clancy, Eoin; Higgins, Owen; Forrest, Matthew S.; Boo, Teck Wee; Cormican, Martin; Barry, Thomas; Piepenburg, Olaf; Smith, Terry J.",BMC Infect Dis,32,3

However, there are no methods available to detect DNA and RNA viruses in the same reaction system in preclinical level. In this study, we aimed to develop a duplex ultrasensitive nanoparticle DNA probe-based PCR assay (duplex UNDP-PCR) that was able to simultaneously detect DNA and RNA viruses in the same reaction system. PCV2 and TGEV are selected as representatives of the two different types of viruses. PCV2 DNA and TGEV RNA were simultaneously released from the serum sample by boiling with lysis buffer, then magnetic beads and gold nanoparticles coated with single and/or duplex specific probes for TGEV and PCV2 were added to form a sandwich-like complex with nucleic acids released from viruses. After magnetic separation, DNA barcodes specific for PCV2 and TGEV were eluted using DTT and characterized by specific PCR assay for specific DNA barcodes subsequently. The duplex UNDP-PCR showed similar sensitivity as that of single UNDP-PCR and was able to detect 20 copies each of PCV2 and TGEV in the serum, showing approximately 250-fold more sensitivity than conventional duplex PCR/RT-PCR assays. No cross-reaction was observed with other viruses. The positive detection rate of single MMPs- and duplex MMPs-based duplex UNDP-PCR was identical, with 29.6% for PCV2, 9.3% for TGEV and 3.7% for PCV2 and TGEV mixed infection. This duplex UNDP-PCR assay could detect TGEV (RNA virus) and PCV2 (DNA virus) from large-scale serum samples simultaneously without the need for DNA/RNA extraction, purification and reverse transcription of RNA, and showed a significantly increased positive detection rate for PCV2 (29%) and TGEV (11.7%) preclinical infection than conventional duplex PCR/RT-PCR. Therefore, the established duplex UNDP-PCR is a rapid and economical detection method, exhibiting high sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility.","Huang, Yong; Xing, Na; Wang, Zengguo; Zhang, Xiujuan; Zhao, Xiaomin; Du, Qian; Chang, Lingling; Tong, Dewen",PLoS One,32,1

The 190 kb GpSGHV genome contains 160 open reading frames and encodes more than 60 confirmed proteins. The asymptomatic GpSGHV infection in flies can convert to symptomatic infection that is characterized by overt salivary gland hypertrophy (SGH). Flies with SGH show reduced general fitness and reproductive dysfunction. Although the occurrence of SGH is an exception rather than the rule, G. pallidipes is thought to be the most susceptible to expression of overt SGH symptoms compared to other Glossina species that are largely asymptomatic. Although Glossina salivary glands (SGs) play an essential role in GpSGHV transmission, the functions of the salivary components during the virus infection are poorly understood. In this study, we used mass spectrometry to study SG proteomes of G. pallidipes and G. m. morsitans, two Glossina model species that exhibit differential GpSGHV pathologies (high and low incidence of SGH, respectively). A total of 540 host proteins were identified, of which 23 and 9 proteins were significantly up- and down-regulated, respectively, in G. pallidipes compared to G. m. morsitans. Whereas 58 GpSGHV proteins were detected in G. pallidipes F(1) progenies, only 5 viral proteins were detected in G. m. morsitans. Unlike in G. pallidipes, qPCR assay did not show any significant increase in virus titers in G. m. morsitans F(1) progenies, confirming that G. m. morsitans is less susceptible to GpSGHV infection and replication compared to G. pallidipes. Based on our results, we speculate that in the case of G. pallidipes, GpSGHV employs a repertoire of host intracellular signaling pathways for successful infection. In the case of G. m. morsitans, antiviral responses appeared to be dominant. These results are useful for designing additional tools to investigate the Glossina-GpSGHV interactions.","Kariithi, Henry M.; İnce, İkbal Agah; Boeren, Sjef; Murungi, Edwin K.; Meki, Irene K.; Otieno, Everlyne A.; Nyanjom, Steven R.

The genome consisted of 128,058 bp and had an overall G+C content of 40%. There were 130 hypothetical open reading frames (ORFs) potentially encoding proteins of more than 50 amino acids and covering 92% of the genome. Among all the hypothetical ORFs, 37 baculovirus core genes, 23 lepidopteran baculovirus conserved genes and 10 genes conserved in Group I alphabaculoviruses were identified. In addition, the genome included regions of 8 typical baculoviral homologous repeat sequences (hrs). Phylogenic analysis showed that CapoNPV was in a distinct branch of clade “a” in Group I alphabaculoviruses. Gene parity plot analysis and overall similarity of ORFs indicated that CapoNPV is more closely related to the Group I alphabaculoviruses than to other baculoviruses. Interesting, CapoNPV lacks the genes encoding the fibroblast growth factor (fgf) and ac30, which are conserved in most lepidopteran and Group I baculoviruses, respectively. Sequence analysis of the F-like protein of CapoNPV showed that some amino acids were inserted into the fusion peptide region and the pre-transmembrane region of the protein. All these unique features imply that CapoNPV represents a member of a new baculovirus species.","Wang, Jun; Zhu, Zheng; Zhang, Lei; Hou, Dianhai; Wang, Manli; Arif, Basil; Kou, Zheng; Wang, Hualin; Deng, Fei; Hu, Zhihong",PLoS One,32,1
2450,2450,2450,Pathogenesis of Korean Sapelovirus A in piglets and chicks,10.960141,8.762148,2016-10-13,"Sapelovirus A (SV-A), formerly known as porcine sapelovirus as a member of a new genus Sapelovirus, is known to cause enteritis, pneumonia, polioencephalomyelitis and reproductive disorders in pigs. We have recently identified α2,3-linked sialic acid on GD1a ganglioside as a functional SV-A receptor rich in the cells of pigs and chickens. However, the role of GD1a in viral pathogenesis remains elusive. Here, we demonstrated that a Korean SV-A strain could induce diarrhoea and intestinal pathology in piglets but not in chicks. Moreover, this Korean SV-A strain had mild extra-intestinal tropisms appearing as mild, non-suppurative myelitis, encephalitis and pneumonia in piglets, but not in chicks. By real-time reverse transcription (RT) PCR, higher viral RNA levels were detected in faecal samples than in sera or extra-intestinal organs from virus-inoculated piglets. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that high viral antigens were detected in the epithelial cells of intestines from virus-inoculated piglets but not from chicks. This Korean SV-A strain could bind the cultured cell lines originated from various species, but replication occurred only in cells of porcine origin. These data indicated that this Korean SV-A strain could replicate and induce pathology in piglets but not in chicks, suggesting that additional porcine-specific factors are required for virus entry and replication. In addition, this Korean SV-A strain is enteropathogenic, but could spread to the bloodstream from the gut and disseminate to extra-intestinal organs and tissues. These results will contribute to our understanding of SV-A pathogenesis so that efficient anti-sapelovirus drugs and vaccines could be developed in the future.","Kim, Deok-Song; Kang, Mun-Il; Son, Kyu-Yeol; Bak, Geon-Yong; Park, Jun-Gyu; Hosmillo, Myra; Seo, Ja-Young; Kim, Ji-Yun; Alfajaro, Mia Madel; Soliman, Mahmoud; Baek, Yeong-Bin; Cho, Eun-Hyo; Lee, Ju-Hwan; Kwon, Joseph; Choi, Jong-Soon; Goodfellow, Ian; Cho, Kyoung-Oh",J Gen Virol,32,1

Like Spiroplasma mirum, S. eriocheiris infects the newborn mouse (adult mice are not infected) and can cause cataract. Adhesion-related protein is an important protein involved in the interaction between pathogen and host. In this study, the Adhesin-like Protein (ALP) of S. eriocheiris was detected on its outer membrane by using immune electron microscopy, and was found to be involved in the bacterium's infection of mouse embryo fibroblasts (3T6-Swiss albino). Yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated that ALP interacts with a diverse group of mouse proteins. The interactions between recombinant partial fibulin7 (FBLN7; including two epidermal growth factor [EGF] domains) and ALP were confirmed by Far-western blotting and colocalization. We synthetized the domains of FBLN7 [EGF domain: amino acids 136–172 and complement control protein (CCP) domain: 81–134 amino acids], and demonstrated that only EGF domain of FBLN7 can interact with ALP. Because the EGF domain has high degree of similarity to EGF, it can activate the downstream EGFR signaling pathway, in key site amino acids. The EGFR pathway in 3T6 cells was restrained after rALP stimulation resulting from competitive binding of ALP to EGF. The unborn mouse, newborn mouse, and the adult mouse with cataract have a small amount of expressed FBLN7; however, none was detected in the brain and very little expression was seen in the eye of normal adult mice. In short, ALP as a S. eriocheiris surface protein, is critical for infection and further supports the role of ALP in S. eriocheiris infection by competitive effection of the EGF/EGFR axis of the target cells.","Hou, Libo; Liu, Yuhan; Gao, Qi; Xu, Xuechuan; Ning, Mingxiao; Bi, Jingxiu; Liu, Hui; Liu, Min; Gu, Wei; Wang, Wen; Meng, Qingguo",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,32,8
2747,2747,2747,The Intestinal Eukaryotic and Bacterial Biome of Spotted Hyenas: The Impact of Social Status and Age on Diversity and Composition,11.2593775,8.569537,2017-06-16,"In mammals, two factors likely to affect the diversity and composition of intestinal bacteria (bacterial microbiome) and eukaryotes (eukaryome) are social status and age. In species in which social status determines access to resources, socially dominant animals maintain better immune processes and health status than subordinates. As high species diversity is an index of ecosystem health, the intestinal biome of healthier, socially dominant animals should be more diverse than those of subordinates. Gradual colonization of the juvenile intestine after birth predicts lower intestinal biome diversity in juveniles than adults. We tested these predictions on the effect of: (1) age (juvenile/adult) and (2) social status (low/high) on bacterial microbiome and eukaryome diversity and composition in the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), a highly social, female-dominated carnivore in which social status determines access to resources. We comprehensively screened feces from 35 individually known adult females and 7 juveniles in the Serengeti ecosystem for bacteria and eukaryotes, using a set of 48 different amplicons (4 for bacterial 16S, 44 for eukaryote 18S) in a multi-amplicon sequencing approach. We compared sequence abundances to classical coprological egg or oocyst counts. For all parasite taxa detected in more than six samples, the number of sequence reads significantly predicted the number of eggs or oocysts counted, underscoring the value of an amplicon sequencing approach for quantitative measurements of parasite load. In line with our predictions, our results revealed a significantly less diverse microbiome in juveniles than adults and a significantly higher diversity of eukaryotes in high-ranking than low-ranking animals. We propose that free-ranging wildlife can provide an intriguing model system to assess the adaptive value of intestinal biome diversity for both bacteria and eukaryotes.","Heitlinger, Emanuel; Ferreira, Susana C.

Currently-available therapies are ineffective in curing chronic HBV infection. HBV and its satellite hepatitis D virus (HDV) infect hepatocytes via binding of the preS1 domain of its large envelope protein to sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). Here, we developed novel human monoclonal antibodies that block the engagement of preS1 with NTCP and neutralize HBV and HDV with high potency. One antibody, 2H5-A14, functions at picomolar level and exhibited neutralization-activity-mediated prophylactic effects. It also acts therapeutically by eliciting antibody-Fc-dependent immunological effector functions that impose durable suppression of viral infection in HBV-infected mice, resulting in reductions in the levels of the small envelope antigen and viral DNA, with no emergence of escape mutants. Our results illustrate a novel antibody-Fc-dependent approach for HBV treatment and suggest 2H5-A14 as a novel clinical candidate for HBV prevention and treatment of chronic HBV infection.","Li, Dan; He, Wenhui; Liu, Ximing; Zheng, Sanduo; Qi, Yonghe; Li, Huiyu; Mao, Fengfeng; Liu, Juan; Sun, Yinyan; Pan, Lijing; Du, Kaixin; Ye, Keqiong; Li, Wenhui; Sui, Jianhua",,32,11

Therapeutic interventions are lacking and disease pathogenesis is yet to be fully elucidated. The anti-viral immune response has been reported, but humoral involvement in viral pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here we show defective serological responses to SFTSV is associated with disease fatality and a combination of B-cell and T-cell impairment contribute to disruption of anti-viral immunity. The serological profile in deceased patients is characterized by absence of specific IgG to viral nucleocapsid and glycoprotein due to failure of B-cell class switching. Expansion and impairment of antibody secretion is a signature of fatal SFTSV infection. Apoptosis of monocytes in the early stage of infection diminishes antigen-presentation by dendritic cells, impedes differentiation and function of T follicular helper cells, and contributes to failure of the virus-specific humoral response.","Song, Peixin; Zheng, Nan; Liu, Yong; Tian, Chen; Wu, Xilin; Ma, Xiaohua; Chen, Deyan; Zou, Xue; Wang, Guiyang; Wang, Huanru; Zhang, Yongyang; Lu, Sufang; Wu, Chao; Wu, Zhiwei",Nat Commun,32,8

However, the mechanism governing cbDVG generation remains unknown, thereby limiting our ability to manipulate cbDVG content in order to modulate the host response to infection. Here we report a specific genomic signal that mediates the generation of a subset of RSV cbDVG species. Using a customized bioinformatics tool, we identified regions in the RSV genome frequently used to generate cbDVGs during infection. We then created a minigenome system to validate the function of one of these sequences and to determine if specific nucleotides were essential for cbDVG generation at that position. Further, we created a recombinant virus unable to produce a subset of cbDVGs due to mutations introduced in this sequence. The identified sequence was also found as a site for cbDVG generation during natural RSV infections, and common cbDVGs originated at this sequence were found among samples from various infected patients. These data demonstrate that sequences encoded in the viral genome determine the location of cbDVG formation and, therefore, the generation of cbDVGs is not a stochastic process. These findings open the possibility of genetically manipulating cbDVG formation to modulate infection outcome.","Sun, Yan; Kim, Eun Ji; Felt, Sébastien A.; Taylor, Louis J.; Agarwal, Divyansh; Grant, Gregory R.; López, Carolina B.",PLoS Pathog,32,28

A chimpanzee simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) envelope (Env) shares a single bnAb site, the variable loop 2 (V2)-apex, with HIV, suggesting its possible utility in an HIV immunization strategy. Here, we generate a chimpanzee SIV Env trimer, MT145K, which displays selective binding to HIV V2-apex bnAbs and precursor versions, but no binding to other HIV specificities. We determine the structure of the MT145K trimer by cryo-EM and show that its architecture is remarkably similar to HIV Env. Immunization of an HIV V2-apex bnAb precursor Ab-expressing knockin mouse with the chimpanzee MT145K trimer induces HIV V2-specific neutralizing responses. Subsequent boosting with an HIV trimer cocktail induces responses that exhibit some virus cross-neutralization.

Adaptive mutations could have contributed to the successful emergence of ZIKV as a global health threat to a nonimmune population. However, the causal relationships between the ZIKV genetic determinants, the pathogenesis and the rapid spread in Latin America and in the Caribbean remain widely unknown. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterise three ZIKV isolates obtained from patient samples during the 2015/2016 Brazilian epidemics. METHODS: The ZIKV genomes of these strains were completely sequenced and in vitro infection kinetics experiments were carried out in cell lines and human primary cells. FINDINGS: Eight nonsynonymous substitutions throughout the viral genome of the three Brazilian isolates were identified. Infection kinetics experiments were carried out with mammalian cell lines A549, Huh7.5, Vero E6 and human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mdDCs) and insect cells (Aag2, C6/36 and AP61) and suggest that some of these mutations might be associated with distinct viral fitness. The clinical isolates also presented differences in their infectivity rates when compared to the well-established ZIKV strains (MR766 and PE243), especially in their abilities to infect mammalian cells. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Genomic analysis of three recent ZIKV isolates revealed some nonsynonymous substitutions, which could have an impact on the viral fitness in mammalian and insect cells.","Strottmann, Daisy Maria; Zanluca, Camila; Mosimann, Ana Luiza Pamplona; Koishi, Andrea C; Auwerter, Nathalia Cavalheiro; Faoro, Helisson; Cataneo, Allan Henrique Depieri; Kuczera, Diogo; Wowk, Pryscilla Fanini; Bordignon, Juliano; Duarte dos Santos, Claudia Nunes",Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz,32,28

We retrospectively reviewed patient records in our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of pediatric cardiovascular operations between March 2015 and March 2018. We selected five days of continuous post-operative data just after termination of muscle relaxants. Midazolam sedation was estimated by Bayesian inference for generalized linear mixed models. We enrolled 104 patients (average age 26 weeks) of which 16 (15%) had DS. DS patients had a high probability of receiving a higher midazolam dosage and dexmedetomidine dosage over the study period (probability = 0.99, probability = 0.97) while depth of sedation was not different in DS patients (probability = 0.35). Multi regression modeling included severity scores and demographic data showed DS decreases midazolam sedation compared with controls (posterior OR = 1.32, 95% CrI = 1.01–1.75).

Proteins are major chromophores and targets for damage due to their abundance, but the role of proteins in inducing damage to bound DNA, and the effects on DNA-protein interactions is less well characterized. In E. coli (and other Gram-negative bacteria) the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP/CAP) regulates more than 500 genes. In this study we show that exposure of isolated dimeric CRP-cAMP to UV modifies specific Met, Trp, Tyr, and Pro side-chains, induces inter-protein Tyr63-Tyr41 cross-links, and decreases DNA binding via oxidation of Met114/Pro110 residues in close proximity at the CRP dimer interface. UV exposure also modifies DNA-bound cAMP-CRP, with this resulting in DNA cleavage at specific G/C residues within the sequence bound to CRP, but not at other G/C sites. Oxidation also increases CRP dissociation from DNA. The modifications at the CRP dimer interface, and the site-specific DNA strand cleavage are proposed to occur via oxidation of two species Met residues (Met114 and Met189, respectively) to reactive persulfoxides that damage neighbouring amino acids and DNA bases. These data suggest that modification to CRP, and bound DNA, contributes to UV sensitivity.","Leinisch, Fabian; Mariotti, Michele; Andersen, Sofie Hagel; Lindemose, Søren; Hägglund, Per; Møllegaard, Niels Erik; Davies, Michael J.",Sci Rep,32,1

This study aimed at developing short-term forecasting models of daily ambulance calls using the 7-day weather forecast data as predictors. We employed the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method to analyze over 1.3 million cases of emergency attendance in May 2006 through April 2009 and the 7-day weather forecast data for the same period. Our results showed that the ARIMA model could offer reasonably accurate forecasts of daily ambulance calls at 1–7 days ahead of time and with improved accuracy by including weather factors. Specifically, the inclusion of average temperature alone in our ARIMA model improved the predictability of the 1-day forecast when compared to that of a simple ARIMA model (8.8 % decrease in the root mean square error, RMSE = 53 vs 58). The improvement in the 7-day forecast with average temperature as a predictor was more pronounced, with a 10 % drop in prediction error (RMSE = 62 vs 69). These findings suggested that weather forecast data can improve the 1- to 7-day forecasts of daily ambulance demand. As weather forecast data are readily accessible from Hong Kong Observatory’s official website, there is virtually no cost to including them in the ARIMA models, which yield better prediction for forward planning and deployment of ambulance manpower.","Wong, Ho-Ting; Lai, Poh-Chin",Int J Biometeorol,32,28

The second virial coefficient, b(2), derived from the dilution enthalpies of protein solution measured by ITC under various experimental conditions was studied. The protein applied in this work is human recombinant interferon-α2a (hrIFN-α2a), which is a commercial drug applied for the treatment of virus-infected diseases. The results obtained were used to predict the possibility of hrIFN-α2a aggregation, and the prediction can be further confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Various factors affecting the stability of protein solution were investigated, for example, temperature, salts, surfactants, and mechanical stress. Specifically, the results show that the dilution enthalpy of hrIFN-α2a increased with increasing temperature and NaCl concentration, while b(2) decreased, indicating that the attraction between hrIFN-α2a molecules was enhanced under these conditions. On studying the effect of mechanical stress, the data obtained reveals that the introduction of centrifugal or vortex force strengthened the attractive forces between hrIFN-α2a molecules. These implications were supported by SEC data, demonstrating that the amount of aggregated hrIFN-α2a was increased.

We aimed to develop a research agenda for GI dysfunction for future research. We systematically reviewed the current knowledge on a broad range of subtopics from a specific viewpoint of GI dysfunction, highlighting the remaining areas of uncertainty and suggesting future studies. METHODS: This systematic scoping review and research agenda was conducted following successive steps: (1) identify clinically important subtopics within the field of GI function which warrant further research; (2) systematically review the literature for each subtopic using PubMed, CENTRAL and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; (3) summarize evidence for each subtopic; (4) identify areas of uncertainty; (5) formulate and refine study proposals that address these subtopics; and (6) prioritize study proposals via sequential voting rounds. RESULTS: Five major themes were identified: (1) monitoring, (2) associations between GI function and outcome, (3) GI function and nutrition, (4) management of GI dysfunction and (5) pathophysiological mechanisms. Searches on 17 subtopics were performed and evidence summarized. Several areas of uncertainty were identified, six of them needing consensus process. Study proposals ranked among the first ten included: prevention and management of diarrhoea; management of upper and lower feeding intolerance, including indications for post-pyloric feeding and opioid antagonists; acute gastrointestinal injury grading as a bedside tool; the role of intra-abdominal hypertension in the development and monitoring of GI dysfunction and in the development of non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia; and the effect of proton pump inhibitors on the microbiome in critical illness. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence on GI dysfunction is scarce, partially due to the lack of precise definitions. The use of core sets of monitoring and outcomes are required to improve the consistency of future studies. We propose several areas for consensus process and outline future study projects.","Reintam Blaser, Annika; Preiser, Jean-Charles; Fruhwald, Sonja; Wilmer, Alexander; Wernerman, Jan; Benstoem, Carina; Casaer, Michael P.; Starkopf, Joel; van Zanten, Arthur; Rooyackers, Olav; Jakob, Stephan M.; Loudet, Cecilia I.; Bear, Danielle E.; Elke, Gunnar; Kott, Matthias; Lautenschläger, Ingmar; Schäper, Jörn; Gunst, Jan; Stoppe, Christian; Nobile, Leda; Fuhrmann, Valentin; Berger, Mette M.; Oudemans-van Straaten, Heleen M.; Arabi, Yaseen M.; Deane, Adam M.",Crit Care,32,1

Previous studies have focused on the transmission of cyber collective emotion; however, little attention has been paid to the transmission of collective emotion in face-to-face interactions. Using an experimental design, we examined how emotions are transmitted from some members to the whole group in face-to-face situations. We used a news report of a social event as an emotion stimulus to induce anger and disgust in 158 middle school students aged 12 to 15, with an average age of 13.20 years (SD = 0.651) We randomly assigned one-third of the participants to be “transmitters,” while the others were “receivers.” Transmitters shared their feelings with receivers; then, receivers communicated with other group members. The results indicated that negative collective emotions were transmitted from high- to low-intensity members, which converged through the effect of emotional contagion. It accumulated through the effect of an emotional circle, during which the feedback reinforced emotion intensity. The collective emotion transmission model comprised emotion diffusion, contagion, and accumulation. This model elucidates the intrinsic features of collective emotion transmission, enriches the research on collective emotion, and provides theoretical references for monitoring and managing future public events.","Zheng, Wen; Yu, Ailin; Fang, Ping; Peng, Kaiping",PLoS One,32,8

Some diseases are often diagnosed in patients in specific temporal sequences, which are referred to as disease trajectories. Here, we determine whether a sequence of two diseases forms a trajectory by leveraging the predicate information from paths between (disease) proteins in a knowledge graph. Furthermore, we determine the added value of directional information of predicates for this task. To do so, we create four feature sets, based on two methods for representing indirect paths, and both with and without directional information of predicates (i.e., which protein is considered subject and which object). The added value of the directional information of predicates is quantified by comparing the classification performance of the feature sets that include or exclude it. RESULTS: Our method achieved a maximum area under the ROC curve of 89.8% and 74.5% when evaluated with two different reference sets. Use of directional information of predicates significantly improved performance by 6.5 and 2.0 percentage points respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our work demonstrates that predicates between proteins can be used to identify disease trajectories. Using the directional information of predicates significantly improved performance over not using this information.","Vlietstra, Wytze J.; Vos, Rein; van den Akker, Marjan; van Mulligen, Erik M.; Kors, Jan A.",J Biomed Semantics,32,28

However, CCGs are located in complex socio-political and ecological settings and many community gardens struggle or fail. However, few studies have assessed the socio-political/ecological context of a garden setting prior to its development to understand the potential barriers and enablers of success. Our study assessed the socio-spatial context of a proposed CCG at a student university accommodation site. We engaged diverse university and community stakeholders through interviews, focus groups and a survey to explore their perceptions of the space generally and the proposed garden specifically. Visual observations and public life surveying were used to determine patterns of behavior. Results confirmed known problems associated with an underutilized site that provides little opportunity for lingering or contact with nature; and unknown barriers, including socially disconnected stakeholders and community distrust of the university. The research also uncovered positive enablers, such as stakeholder appreciation of the social, wellbeing and ecological benefits that a CCG could deliver. Our findings suggest that an in-depth exploration of a proposed garden context can be an important enabler of its success.","Marsh, Pauline; Mallick, Suzanne; Flies, Emily; Jones, Penelope; Pearson, Sue; Koolhof, Iain; Byrne, Jason; Kendal, Dave",Int J Environ Res Public Health,32,8

In 2017, we conducted a cross-sectional study using stratified cluster, convenience sampling method to assess condom use intention among senior high school students in Tianjin, China. One thousand eighty two senior high school students were anonymously surveyed through self-administered questionnaires. Structural equation modelling was used to assess the pre-intentional phase of HAPA model. Among the participants, 41.5% (449/1082) were male, 54.1% (585/1082) were female, 4.4% (48/1082) were gender-deficient. The average age was 16.7 years. The final pre-intentional phase of HAPA model was acceptable (CFI = 0.95; GFI = 0.94; RMSEA = 0.06). Action self-efficacy (r = 0.60) had a strong direct effect on condom use intention. The pre-intentional phase of HAPA model is valid to assess condom use intention among Chinese senior high school students. The pre-intention phase of the HAPA model could be applied to guide AIDS health educations of students, and further research is needed to evaluate the effect.","Xu, Fang; Bu, Kai; Chen, Fangfang; Jin, Shanshan; Zhang, Hanxi; Zhang, Dong; Sun, Caixia; Wang, Ning; Han, Mengjie; Wang, Lu",Medicine (Baltimore),32,1

However, national temporal trends of LEA incidence rates among US veterans and associated factors have not been well characterized. OBJECTIVE: To describe the temporal trends of LEA, characterize associated risk factors, and decompose the associations of these risk factors with changes in temporal trends of LEA among US veterans using Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) services between 2008 and 2018. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used VA data from 2008 to 2018 to estimate incidence rates of LEA among veterans using VA services. Cox regression models were used to identify risk factors associated with LEA. Decomposition analyses estimated the associations of changes in prevalence of risk factors with changes in LEA rates. Data were analyzed from October 1, 2007, to September 30, 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Toe, transmetatarsal, below-knee, or above-knee LEA. RESULTS: A total of 6 493 141 veterans were included (median [interquartile range] age, 64 [54-76] years; 6 060 390 [93.4%] men). Veterans were studied for a median (interquartile range) of 10.9 (5.6-11.0) years. Between 2008 and 2018, rates of LEA increased from 12.89 (95% CI, 12.53-13.25) LEA per 10 000 persons to 18.12 (95% CI, 17.70-18.54) LEA per 10 000 persons, representing a net increase of 5.23 (95% CI, 4.68-5.78) LEA per 10 000 persons. Between 2008 and 2018, toe amputation rates increased by 3.24 (2.89-3.59) amputations per 10 000 persons, accounting for 62.0% of the total increase in LEA rates. Transmetatarsal amputations increased by 1.54 (95% CI, 1.27-1.81) amputations per 10 000 persons; below-knee amputation rates increased by 0.81 (95% CI, 0.56-1.05) amputations per 10 000 persons; and above-knee amputation rates decreased by 0.37 (95% CI, 0.14-0.59) amputations per 10 000 persons. Compared with men, women had decreased risk of any LEA (hazard ratio [HR], 0.34 [95% CI, 0.31-0.37]). Factors associated with increased risk of any LEA included Black race (HR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.21-1.28]) or another non-White race (ie, Asian, Latino, or other; HR, 2.36 [95% CI, 2.30-2.42]), obesity (HR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.55-1.63]), diabetes (HR, 6.38 [95% CI, 6.22-6.54]), chronic kidney disease (CKD; eg, CKD stage 5: HR, 3.94 [95% CI, 3.22-4.83]), and smoking status (eg, current smoking: HR, 1.97 [95% CI, 1.92-2.03]). Decomposition analyses suggested that while changes in demographic composition, primarily driven by increased proportion of women veterans, associated with a decrease of 0.18 (95% CI, 0.14-0.22) LEA per 10 000 persons, and decreases in smoking rates, associated with a decrease of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.79-0.97) LEA per 10 000 persons. However, these were overwhelmed by increased rates of diabetes, associated with an increase of 1.86 (95% CI, 1.72-1.99) LEA per 10 000 persons; peripheral arterial disease, associated with an increase of 1.53 (95% CI, 1.41-1.65) LEA per 10 000 persons; CKD, associated with an increase of 1.45 (95% CI, 1.33-1.57) LEA per 10 000 persons; and other clinical factors, including body mass index, cancer, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic lung disease, dementia, and hypertension, associated with an increase of 1.45 (95% CI, 1.33-1.57) LEA per 10 000 persons. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that incidence rates of LEA among veterans using VA services increased between 2008 and 2018. Efforts aimed at reducing burden of LEA should target the reduction of diabetes, peripheral arterial disease, and CKD at the individual and population levels.","Cai, Miao; Xie, Yan; Bowe, Benjamin; Gibson, Andrew K.; Zayed, Mohamed A.; Li, Tingting; Al-Aly, Ziyad",JAMA Netw Open,32,5

However, from the literature, perception of artificial meat in China is not well known. A survey was thus carried out to investigate Chinese attitudes toward artificial meat. The answers of 4666 respondents concluded that 19.9% and 9.6% of them were definitely willing and unwilling to try artificial meat respectively, whereas 47.2% were not willing to eat it regularly, and 87.2% were willing to pay less for it compared to conventional meat. Finally, 52.9% of them will accept artificial meat as an alternative to conventional meat. Emotional resistance such as the perception of “absurdity or disgusting” would lead to no willingness to eat artificial meat regularly. The main concerns were related to safety and unnaturalness, but less to ethical and environmental issues as in Western countries. Nearly half of the respondents would like artificial meat to be safe, tasty, and nutritional. Whereas these expectations have low effects on willingness to try, they may induce consumers’ rejection to eat artificial meat regularly, underlying the weak relationship between wishes to try and to eat regularly. Thus, potential acceptance of artificial meat in China depends on Chinese catering culture, perception of food and traditional philosophy.","Liu, Jingjing; Hocquette, Élise; Ellies-Oury, Marie-Pierre; Chriki, Sghaier; Hocquette, Jean-François",Foods,32,1

Unlike humans and other typical mammals, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of chickens can confer decisive resistance or susceptibility to many viral diseases. An iconic example is Marek’s disease, caused by an oncogenic herpesvirus with over 100 genes. Classical MHC class I and class II molecules present antigenic peptides to T lymphocytes, and it has been hard to understand how such MHC molecules could be involved in susceptibility to Marek’s disease, given the potential number of peptides from over 100 genes. We used a new in vitro infection system and immunopeptidomics to determine peptide motifs for the 2 class II molecules expressed by the MHC haplotype B2, which is known to confer resistance to Marek’s disease. Surprisingly, we found that the vast majority of viral peptide epitopes presented by chicken class II molecules arise from only 4 viral genes, nearly all having the peptide motif for BL2*02, the dominantly expressed class II molecule in chickens. We expressed BL2*02 linked to several Marek’s disease virus (MDV) peptides and determined one X-ray crystal structure, showing how a single small amino acid in the binding site causes a crinkle in the peptide, leading to a core binding peptide of 10 amino acids, compared to the 9 amino acids in all other reported class II molecules. The limited number of potential T cell epitopes from such a complex virus can explain the differential MHC-determined resistance to MDV, but raises questions of mechanism and opportunities for vaccine targets in this important food species, as well as providing a basis for understanding class II molecules in other species including humans.","Halabi, Samer; Ghosh, Michael; Stevanović, Stefan; Rammensee, Hans-Georg; Bertzbach, Luca D.; Kaufer, Benedikt B.; Moncrieffe, Martin C.; Kaspers, Bernd; Härtle, Sonja; Kaufman, Jim",PLoS Biol,32,1

Cardiovascular ageing refers to cardiovascular structural and functional alterations that occur with chronological ageing and that can lead to the development of cardiovascular disease. These alterations, which were previously only detectable on tissue histology or corroborated on blood samples, are now detectable with modern imaging techniques. Despite the emergence of powerful new imaging tools, clinical investigation into cardiovascular ageing is challenging because ageing is a life course phenomenon involving known and unknown risk factors that play out in a dynamic fashion. Metabolomic profiling measures large numbers of metabolites with diverse chemical properties. Metabolomics has the potential to capture changes in biochemistry brought about by pathophysiologic processes as well as by normal ageing. When combined with non‐invasive cardiovascular imaging tools, metabolomics can be used to understand pathological consequences of cardiovascular ageing. This review will summarize previous metabolomics and imaging studies in cardiovascular ageing. These methods may be a clinically relevant and novel approach to identify mechanisms of cardiovascular ageing and formulate or personalize treatment strategies.","Koh, Angela S.; Kovalik, Jean‐Paul",ESC Heart Fail,32,8

Inflammation in obese subjects is closely related to ID. It induces reduced iron absorption correlated to the inhibition of duodenal ferroportin expression, parallel to the increased concentrations of hepcidin. Obese subjects often get decreased inflammatory response after bariatric surgery, accompanied by decreased serum hepcidin and therefore improved iron absorption. Bariatric surgery can induce the mitigation or resolution of obesity-associated complications, such as hypertension, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, adjusting many parameters in the metabolism. However, gastric bypass surgery and sleeve gastrectomy can induce malabsorption and may accentuate ID.

This study aims to appraise the rate reduction of seasonal influenza vaccine among vaccinated children and their household members, and that of the vaccinated cohort and their household members. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was performed in winter 2016–2017 in Tel-Aviv District, Israel and compared second-grade pupils who were vaccinated at school, with third-grade pupils- who were not vaccinated at school. Parents in nine schools were asked to report prior vaccination against influenza and influenza-like illness (ILI) of their children and other household members. Rate reduction was defined as [(ILI among unvaccinated) – (ILI among vaccinated)] / (ILI among vaccinated) (%). RESULTS: Of 527 participants, 359 (68.1%) were unvaccinated and 168 (31.9%) vaccinated. Unvaccinated children reported more ILI compared with vaccinated children (19.5% vs. 7.7%), yielding a rate reduction of 60.5%. Unvaccinated children also had a greater number of physicians’ visits and missed school days (35.7% vs. 14.9 and 42.9% vs. 25.6%, respectively). The rate of ILI among household members of unvaccinated children was 34.5%, compared with 25.0% among household members of vaccinated children. The vaccinated cohort (defined as all children in second grade) reported less ILI compared with the unvaccinated cohort (defined as all children in third grade), with a rate reduction of 44.6%. Pupils of the unvaccinated cohort were more likely to miss school days (42.1% vs. 32.0%, respectively), and a higher rate of ILI was reported among household members of the unvaccinated cohort (35.4% vs. 27.3%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Influenza vaccine administered in school setting reduced ILI among the vaccinated cohort and their household members by 60.5 and 27.5%, respectively, compared with the unvaccinated cohort. Expansion of the vaccination program in a school setting increased the public health benefit of influenza vaccines among both school children and their household members.","Shviro Roseman, Noa; Bilenko, Natalya; Sheffer, Rivka; Mor, Zohar",Isr J Health Policy Res,32,8

METHODS: Two methods of cell- and DNA-based heat treatment were used. Heating DNA solution was performed at 94 °C for 5, 10 and 15 min, and also 72 °C for 30, 60 and 120 min, individually. Moreover, heating the cells was done by incubation at 42 °C for 2 h in different times such as before, during and after DNA transfection. RESULTS: Our data showed that the conformation of plasmid DNAs was changed at different temperatures with increasing time. The heat-treated plasmid DNAs (94 °C for 10 min or 72 °C for 30 min) indicated higher transfection efficiency than untreated plasmid DNAs (p < 0.05). Furthermore, heat treatment of cells before and during the transfection was higher than untreated cells (p < 0.01). Our results demonstrated that DNA transfection efficiency in cancerous cells was less than non-cancerous cells (p < 0.01).

History, physical examination, chest radiographs (CXRs), blood cultures and nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs were obtained and tested by polymerase chain reaction and routine microbiology for the presence of 30 bacteria and viruses. From age and seasonally matched controls, we tested blood and nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples. We used the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health integrated analysis to determine the individual and population etiologic fraction for individual pathogens as the cause of pneumonia. RESULTS: Among the 514 HIV-uninfected case children, 208 (40.5%) had abnormal CXRs (61 of 514 children were missing CXR), 8 (3.8%) of which had positive blood cultures. The overall mortality was 16.0% (82 deaths). The etiologic fraction was highest for respiratory syncytial virus [26.1%, 95% credible interval (CrI): 17.0–37.7], Mycobacterium tuberculosis (12.8%, 95% CrI: 4.3–25.3) and human metapneumovirus (12.8%, CrI: 6.1–21.8). CONCLUSIONS: Childhood pneumonia in Zambia among HIV-uninfected children is most frequently caused by respiratory syncytial virus, M. tuberculosis and human metapneumovirus, and the mortality remains high.","Mwananyanda, Lawrence; Thea, Donald M.; Chipeta, James; Kwenda, Geoffrey; Mulindwa, Justin M.; Mwenechanya, Musaku; Prosperi, Christine; Higdon, Melissa M.; Haddix, Meredith; Hammitt, Laura L.; Feikin, Daniel R.; Murdoch, David R.; O’Brien, Katherine L.; Deloria Knoll, Maria; Mwansa, James; Wa Somwe, Somwe; Seidenberg, Phil",Pediatr Infect Dis J,32,1

Early diagnosis is of great significance for early interventional treatment and prolonging survival. PET/CT uses positron radiopharmaceuticals to observe the physiological and biochemical changes of the drug and its metabolites in the body and finally diagnoses the disease. 18F-FDG is a commonly used imaging agent, but its short isotopic half-life limits clinical high-throughput testing. This study retrospectively analyzed the imaging material of 100 lung cancer patients pathologically confirmed. Patients with lymph node metastasis were classified into the LM group (n = 30 cases), and those with no lymph node metastasis were classified into the NLM group (n = 70 cases). The results showed that MRI of superparamagnetic nanoferric oxide was better than diagnosis of lung cancer by the 18F-FDG PET/CT and had a high predictive power for lymph node metastasis. These turned out to be high-value lung cancer diagnosis of superparamagnetic nanoferric oxide MRI and high-capacity lymph node metastasis prediction of 18F-FDG PET/CT, which were worthy of implementation.","Yao, Lan; Zuo, Mingfei; Zhang, Na; Bai, Tian; Huang, Qicheng",Comput Math Methods Med,32,1

MALAT1 is a long noncoding (lnc)RNA that regulates many functional signaling pathways, including tumorigenesis. Herein, we observed the consistent upregulation of MALAT1 in MYST4-overexpressing cell lines, while MALAT1 was frequently found to be upregulated in various types of clinical carcinoma tissues, especially EOC. To further investigate the lncRNA MALAT1 in EOC progression, the transduced overexpression of MALAT1 in EOC cell lines and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) was employed. We found that MALAT1 overexpression in EOC cell lines significantly increased drug resistance, cell migration, and invasion. Furthermore, the concomitant overexpression of MALAT1 in EOC cells and CAFs dramatically increased EOC cell invasion. Accordingly, a mechanistic investigation of MALAT1 overexpression in EOC cells showed that expressions of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and p-P38/p-NFκB/Cox2/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) signaling were significantly increased, which stimulated inflammatory responses, whereas cell apoptosis was inhibited due to increased Bcl-2 levels and reduced Caspase3 levels. After MALAT1 was overexpressed in EOC cells, and the cyclin D1, p-PI3K, and p-Akt expressions increased, suggesting the promotion of tumor cell proliferation, while increased zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox-2 (ZEB2), yes-associated protein (YAP), and vimentin expression with E-cadherin downregulation indicated the enhancement of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in terms of metastasis, thereby triggering EOC progression. Together, our findings demonstrate how MALAT1 overexpression facilitates an oncogenic function through inhibiting tumor cell apoptosis, combined with increasing tumor cell inflammation, proliferation, and invasion in the EOC tumor microenvironment. MALAT1 is thus a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic for this malignancy.","Mao, Tsui-Lien; Fan, Ming-Huei; Dlamini, Nhlanhla; Liu, Chao-Lien",Int J Mol Sci,32,33

Perturbation of ER homeostasis can result in an accumulation of unfolded proteins within the ER lumen, causing ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR). In humans, ER stress and UPR are closely associated with a vast number of diseases, including viral diseases. In plants, two arms that govern the UPR signaling network have been described: one that contains two ER membrane–associated transcription factors (bZIP17 and bZIP28) and the other that encompasses a dual protein kinase (RNA-splicing factor IRE1) and its target RNA (bZIP60). Although early studies mainly focus on the essential roles of the UPR in abiotic stresses, the significance of UPR in plant diseases caused by virus infections has recently drawn much attention. This chapter summarizes the latest scenario of ER stress and UPR in virus-infected plant cells, highlights the emerging roles of the IRE1 pathway in virus infections, and outlines exciting future directions to spark more research interest in the UPR field in plants.","Zhang, Lingrui; Wang, Aiming",Current Research Topics in Plant Virology,32,33

In interface theory and model-based testing with inputs and outputs, conjunctive operators have been introduced: the behaviour allowed by composed specification [Formula: see text] is the behaviour allowed by both partial models [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. The models at hand are non-deterministic interface automata, but the interaction between non-determinism and conjunction is not yet well understood. On the other hand, in the theory of alternating automata, conjunction and non-determinism are core aspects. Alternating automata have not been considered in the context of inputs and outputs, making them less suitable for modelling software interfaces. In this paper, we combine the two modelling paradigms to define alternating interface automata (AIA). We equip these automata with an observational, trace-based semantics, and define testers, to establish correctness of black-box interfaces with respect to an AIA specification.","Janssen, Ramon",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,32,32

Emergency departments (EDs) treat their patients based on symptoms and acuity. However, this perspective is not reflected in claims data. The aim of the AKTIN project was to establish an Emergency Department Data Registry as a data privacy-compliant infrastructure for the use of routine medical data. METHODS: Data from the respective documentation systems are continuously transmitted to local data warehouses using a standardized interface. They are available for several applications such as internal reports but also multicentre studies, in compliance with data privacy regulations. Based on a 12-months period we evaluate the population with focus on acuity assessment (triage) and vital parameters in combination with presenting complaints. RESULTS: For the period April 2018 to March 2019, 436,149 cases from 15 EDs were available. A triage level is documented in 86.0% of cases, and 70.5% were triaged within 10 min of arrival. Ten EDs collected a presenting complaint regularly (82.3%). The respective documentation of vital signs shows plausible patterns. CONCLUSIONS: The AKTIN registry provides an almost real-time insight into German EDs, regardless of the primary documentation system and health insurance claims data.

The recent pandemic exposes the shortcomings of traditional healthcare system, i.e., hospitals and clinics alone are not capable to cope with this situation. One of the major technology that aids contemporary healthcare solutions is the smart and connected wearables. The advancement in Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled these wearables to collect data on an unprecedented scale. These wearables gather context-oriented information related to our physical, behavioural and psychological health. The big data generated by wearables and other healthcare devices of IoT is a challenging task to manage that can negatively affect the inference process at the decision centres. Applying big data analytics for mining information, extracting knowledge and making predictions/inferences has recently attracted significant attention. Machine learning is another area of research that has successfully been applied to solve various networking problems such as routing, traffic engineering, resource allocation, and security. Recently, we have seen a surge in the application of ML-based techniques for the improvement of various IoT applications. Although, big data analytics and machine learning are extensively researched, there is a lack of study that exclusively focus on the evolution of ML-based techniques for big data analysis in the IoT healthcare sector. In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive review on the application of machine learning techniques for big data analysis in the healthcare sector. Furthermore, strength and weaknesses of existing techniques along with various research challenges are highlighted. Our study will provide an insight for healthcare practitioners and government agencies to keep themselves well-equipped with the latest trends in ML-based big data analytics for smart healthcare.","Li, Wei; Chai, Yuanbo; Khan, Fazlullah; Jan, Syed Rooh Ullah; Verma, Sahil; Menon, Varun G.; Kavita; Li, Xingwang",Mobile Netw Appl,32,1

The objective of this study is to test the feasibility of gravitationally driven droplet translocation numerically to enhance the nasal spray dosages in the olfactory region and quantify the intranasal dose distribution in the regions of interest. A computational nasal spray testing platform was developed that included a nasal spray releasing model, an airflow-droplet transport model, and an Eulerian wall film formation/translocation model. The effects of both device-related and administration-related variables on the initial olfactory deposition were studied, including droplet size, velocity, plume angle, spray release position, and orientation. The liquid film formation and translocation after nasal spray applications were simulated for both a standard and a newly proposed delivery system. Results show that the initial droplet deposition in the olfactory region is highly sensitive to the spray plume angle. For the given nasal cavity with a vertex-to-floor head position, a plume angle of 10° with a device orientation of 45° to the nostril delivered the optimal dose to the olfactory region. Liquid wall film translocation enhanced the olfactory dosage by ninefold, compared to the initial olfactory dose, for both the baseline and optimized delivery systems. The optimized delivery system delivered 6.2% of applied sprays to the olfactory region and significantly reduced drug losses in the vestibule. Rheological properties of spray formulations can be explored to harness further the benefits of liquid film translocation in targeted intranasal deliveries.","Si, Xiuhua April; Sami, Muhammad; Xi, Jinxiang",Pharmaceutics,32,20

In this article, we examine ways in which the pandemic has increased the significant difficulties already experienced by these patients and their families. Increased awareness will lead to improvement in the disparities experienced by this population and improve the ability of healthcare providers to care for them. RECENT FINDINGS: The number of children living with medical complexity is rapidly increasing. They face unique circumstances which can lead to compromise in care. This population is especially at risk for complications related to COVID, so may have a more prolonged admission with more morbidities. Children of ethnic minorities are also more impacted by severe illness and death. Finally, access to palliative care has been limited, which is a huge part in caring for these children who have life-long medical care needs. SUMMARY: Children with medical complexity have unique circumstances and the entirety of the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on this group is unknown. While the medical world has found ways to adapt, these changes can increase disparities for this population. Given the increase in number of children with medical complexity living in the USA, it is important to continue to consider the unique challenges they face in the current pandemic and improve the care delivery for both the child and his or her family.","Mitchell, Sarah M.",Curr Pediatr Rep,32,1

METHODS Individual billable services were identified by Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System CPT and G codes. Medicare utilization and payments were stratified by specialty and type of service (electrodiagnostic tests, including NCS and electromyography (EMG), and other neurologic procedures). We also assessed access to Medicare physicians using the annual number of unique beneficiaries receiving initial Evaluation and Management (E/M) services. RESULTS We identified 676,113 Medicare providers included in all analysis years from 2012-2016 (10,599 neurologists, 5,881 physiatrists, and 659,633 other specialties). Comparing 2016to 2012, 21.1% fewer neurologists, 28.6% fewer physiatrists, and 69.3% fewer other specialists performed NCS and 3.8% fewer neurologists, 21.7% fewer physiatrists, and 5.6% fewer other specialists performed EMG. For NCS providers in 2012, the mean number of unique Medicare beneficiaries increased for neurologists (1.2%) and physiatrists (4.8%) but decreased for other specialists (-6.5%) by 2016. Following the NCS cut, the number of providers performing autonomic and evoked potential testing increased substantially. CONCLUSIONS The Medicare NCS reimbursement policy resulted in a larger decrease in NCS providers than in EMG providers. Despite fewer neurologists and physiatrists performing NCS, Medicare access to these physicians for E/M services was not affected. Increased autonomic and evoked potential testing may be an unintended consequence of NCS reimbursement change.","Reynolds, Evan L; Kerber, Kevin A; Hill, Chloe; De Lott, Lindsey B; Magliocco, Brandon; Esper, Gregory J; Callaghan, Brian C",Neurology,32,20

This study examines how subnational governments in federal democracies collect and report data on COVID-19 cases and mortality associated with COVID-19. METHODS We collected data from subnational government websites in 15 federal democracies to construct indices of COVID-19 data quality. Using bivariate and multivariate regression, we analyzed the relationship between these indices and indicators of state capacity, the decentralization of resources and authority, and the quality of democratic institutions. We supplement these quantitative analyses with qualitative case studies of subnational COVID-19 data in Brazil, Spain, and the United States. FINDINGS Subnational governments in federations vary in their collection of data on COVID-19 mortality, testing, hospitalization, and demographics. There are statistically significant associations (p<0.05) between subnational data quality and key indicators of public health system capacity, fiscal decentralization, and the quality of democratic institutions. Case studies illustrate the importance of both governmental and civil-society institutions that foster accountability. CONCLUSIONS The quality of subnational COVID-19 surveillance data in federations depends in part on public health system capacity, fiscal decentralization, and the quality of democracy.","Rocco, Philip; Rich, Jessica A J; Klasa, Katarzyna; Dubin, Kenneth A; Béland, Daniel","Journal of health politics, policy and law",32,19

Our structure-based modification led to the design of a more potent inhibitor, 2 (enzyme IC(50) = 0.46 microM; antiviral EC(50) = 6 microM). Interestingly, its methylamine derivative, 49, displayed good enzyme inhibitory potency (IC(50) = 1.3 microM) and the most potent SARS antiviral activity (EC(50) = 5.2 microM) in the series. We have carried out computational docking studies and generated a predictive 3D-QSAR model for SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors.","Ghosh, Arun K; Takayama, Jun; Aubin, Yoann; Ratia, Kiira; Chaudhuri, Rima; Baez, Yahira; Sleeman, Katrina; Coughlin, Melissa; Nichols, Daniel B; Mulhearn, Debbie C; Prabhakar, Bellur S; Baker, Susan C; Johnson, Michael E; Mesecar, Andrew D",Journal of medicinal chemistry,32,1

This study was designed to compare open versus laparoscopic surgical approaches to liver resection. METHODS We performed a single-center retrospective chart review. RESULTS We compared 45 laparoscopic liver resections with 17 open cases having equivalent resections based on anatomy and diagnosis. The overall complication rate was 25.8%. More open resection patients had complications (52.9% vs 15.5%, P < .008). The conversion rate was 11.1%. The mean blood loss was 667.1 ± 1450 mL in open cases versus 47.8 ± 89 mL in laparoscopic cases (P < .0001). Measures of intravenous narcotic use, intensive care unit length of stay, and hospital length of stay all favored the laparoscopic group. Patients were more likely to have complications or morbidity in the open resection group than in the laparoscopic group for both the anterolateral (P < .085) and posterosuperior (P < .002) resection subgroups. CONCLUSION In this series comparing laparoscopic and open liver resections, there were fewer complications, more rapid recovery, and lower morbidity in the laparoscopic group, even for those resections involving the posterosuperior segments of the liver.","Slakey, Douglas P; Simms, Eric; Drew, Barbara; Yazdi, Farshid; Roberts, Brett",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,32,17

This review determined the worldwide prevalence of human faecal ESBL E. coli carriage and its trend in the community over the past two decades. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar to retrieve articles published between 1 January 2000 and 13 February 2020 that contained data on the prevalence of faecal carriage of ESBL E. coli among healthy individuals. A cumulative (for the whole period) meta-analysis was used to estimate the global and regional pooled prevalence rates. Articles were grouped into study periods of 3 years, and subgroup meta-analyses were undertaken to examine the global pooled prevalence over time. RESULTS Sixty-two articles covering 29 872 healthy persons were included in this meta-analysis. The cumulative (2003-18) global pooled prevalence of ESBL E. coli intestinal carriage in the community was 16.5% (95% CI 14.3%-18.7%; P < 0.001). The pooled prevalence showed an upward trend, increasing from 2.6% (95% CI 1.6%-4.0%) in 2003-05 to 21.1% (95% CI 15.8%-27.0%) in 2015-18. Over the whole period, the highest carriage rate was observed in South-East Asia (27%; 95% CI 2.9%-51.3%), while the lowest occurred in Europe (6.0%; 95% CI 4.6%-7.5%). CONCLUSIONS Globally, an 8-fold increase in the intestinal carriage rate of ESBL E. coli in the community has occurred over the past two decades. Prevention of its spread may require new therapeutic and public health strategies.","Bezabih, Yihienew M; Sabiiti, Wilber; Alamneh, Endalkachew; Bezabih, Alamneh; Peterson, Gregory M; Bezabhe, Woldesellassie M; Roujeinikova, Anna",The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,32,12

In order to initiate an unbiased characterization of the eukaryotic viruses in the gut of dogs, this study used deep sequencing of partially purified viral capsid-protected nucleic acids from the faeces of 18 diarrhoeic dogs. Known canine parvoviruses, coronaviruses and rotaviruses were identified, and the genomes of the first reported canine kobuvirus and sapovirus were characterized. Canine kobuvirus, the first sequenced canine picornavirus and the closest genetic relative of the diarrhoea-causing human Aichi virus, was detected at high frequency in the faeces of both healthy and diarrhoeic dogs. Canine sapovirus constituted a novel genogroup within the genus Sapovirus, a group of viruses also associated with human and animal diarrhoea. These results highlight the high frequency of new virus detection possible even in extensively studied animal species using metagenomics approaches, and provide viral genomes for further disease-association studies.","Li, Linlin; Pesavento, Patricia A; Shan, Tongling; Leutenegger, Christian M; Wang, Chunlin; Delwart, Eric",The Journal of general virology,32,16

We evaluate the efficacy of PTI in improving venepuncture success rate (SR) for patients with poor venous access. METHODS This prospective randomized controlled trial looked at adult patients (n = 69) aged 21-90 with difficult venous access (history of ≥3 consecutive attempts required for successful cannulation during the current admission) requiring non-emergent venepuncture. Patients underwent venepuncture over the upper-limb using one of the following: conventional venepuncture (control); Veinlite® EMS (TransLite®, Texas, USA), a commercial transillumination device; PTI. Outcome measures were: successful cannulation within 2 attempts and total duration of venepuncture. Fisher's exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed. RESULTS A significantly larger number of patients had successful venepuncture within 2 attempts using PTI (22/23, 95.7%) and Veinlite (23/23, 100%), compared to the controls (7/23, 30.4%) (p < 0.05). The total duration required for successful venepuncture was significantly shorter for Veinlite (mean 3.7 min, 1.0-5.3 min) and PTI (mean 8.5 min, range 1.08-27 min) compared to the controls (mean 23.2 min, range 1.88-46.5 min) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS PTI allows users to visualize veins invisible to the naked eye. Thrombosed/tortuous veins, branch points and valves, are easily identified and avoided. It has comparable efficacy to Veinlite® and is cheaper (Veinlite®-USD 227 vs. Penlite-LP212®-USD 7.00) and more easily available. PTI improves patient care, especially in developing regions where costs are a concern.","Cai, Elijah Zhengyang; Sankaran, Kalarani; Tan, Monica; Chan, Yiong Huak; Lim, Thiam Chye",World journal of surgery,32,1

We explored the potential of COVID-19 to further compromise TB care engagement in Zambia. Methods From April to May 2020, we purposefully selected 17 adults newly diagnosed with TB from three public health facilities in Lusaka, Zambia, for in-depth phone interviews. We conducted thematic analyses using a hybrid approach. Results The majority of participants were highly concerned about the impact of lockdowns on their financial security. Most were not worried about being diagnosed with COVID-19 when seeking care for their illness because they felt unwell prior to the outbreak; however, they were very worried about contracting COVID-19 during clinic visits. COVID-19 was perceived as a greater threat than TB as it is highly transmittable and there is no treatment for it, which provoked fear of social isolation and of death among participants in case they contracted it. Nonetheless, participants reported willingness to continue with TB medication and the clinic visits required to improve their health. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic did not appear to deter care-seeking for TB by patients. However, messaging on TB in the era of COVID-19 must encourage timely care-seeking by informing people of infection control measures taken at health facilities.","Mwamba, C; Kerkhoff, A D; Kagujje, M; Lungu, P; Muyoyeta, M; Sharma, A",Public health action,32,1

In the industrialized world, stroke is the third most common cause of death, the second most common cause of dementia, and the most common reason for acquired disability in adulthood. Overall, 20%-30% of ischemic strokes are related to extracranial carotid artery stenosis. Revascularization with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the gold-standard treatment for patients with significant carotid stenosis. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has become an accepted alternative to CEA over the past decade for patients at high surgical risk, and has progressively evolved into an elegant procedure over the past 3 decades, with dedicated equipment including proximal embolic occlusion devices that have minimized procedural strokes. High-surgical-risk CAS registries have established this procedure as an alternative to CEA for high-risk patients. The Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy vs Stent Trial (CREST) has shown similar outcomes with CAS and CEA for patients at standard risk, although CAS is associated with higher minor stroke events and CEA is associated with higher myocardial infarction (MI) events. However, CAS is technically challenging and requires a meticulous approach, with a protracted learning curve that should involve experience with > 70 cases. Careful patient selection is instrumental in avoiding procedural complications, and the procedure should be avoided in patients with prohibitive anatomy. This article reviews the use of CAS for extracranial carotid artery stenosis, considering technical aspects, registry and clinical trial outcomes data, determinants of success, and contemporary guidelines.","Saw, Jacqueline",The Canadian journal of cardiology,32,31

The objective of this study was to identify risk factors for long duration and overall burden of POD after cardiac surgery. DESIGN One-year, single-center, retrospective, observational cohort study. SETTING University hospital. PARTICIPANTS Adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass in 2013. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Patients were screened for POD using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of POD. Secondary outcome measures were the duration of POD and the area under the curve determined using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist score over time. Independent predictors of POD were estimated in multivariable logistic regression models. Hospital length of stay, medications, and outcome data also were analyzed. Among the 656 patients included in the cohort, 618 were analyzed. The overall incidence of POD was 39%. Older patient age (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]) 1.06 [1.04-1.09] for an increase of 1 year, p < 0.001); low preoperative serum albumin (1.08 [1.03-1.13] for a decrease of 1 g/L, p < 0.001); a history of atrial fibrillation (2.30 [1.30-4.09], p = 0.004); perioperative stroke (6.27 [1.54-43.64], p = 0.008); ascending aortic replacement surgery (2.99 [1.50-6.05], p = 0.002); longer duration of procedure (1.37 [1.16-1.63] for an increase of 1 hour, p < 0.001); and increased postoperative C-reactive protein concentration (2.16 [1.49-3.16] for a 2-fold increase, p < 0.001) were associated with higher odds of POD. Among patients affected by POD, older age, perioperative stroke, longer procedure time, and increased postoperative C-reactive protein were consistently predictive of longer duration of POD and greater area under the curve. CONCLUSIONS Known risk factors for the development of POD after cardiac surgery also are predictive of prolonged duration and high overall burden of POD.","Cereghetti, Christian; Siegemund, Martin; Schaedelin, Sabine; Fassl, Jens; Seeberger, Manfred D; Eckstein, Friedrich S; Steiner, Luzius A; Goettel, Nicolai",Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,32,1

Objective To determine the developmental outcomes of HIV-exposed (HE) infants in a low-income South African context, when compared to HIV-unexposed (HU) counterparts. Methods In this prospective cross-sectional, group comparison study, the development of 41 HE and 40 HU infants (mean age=8.4 months, SD=2.1 months) from a low-income context was assessed. Caregivers were interviewed using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Third Edition (Vineland-3) to evaluate infants' development. Results Most HE participants had age-appropriate overall development (90.2%;n=37). Some HE participants, however, presented with delays in domains of communication (9.8%;n=4), daily living skills (2.4%;n=1), socialisation (19.5%;n=8), and motor development (7.3%;n=3). HU participants also demonstrated some domain-specific delays, thus delays were present in both groups. No statistically significant between-group differences regarding development were found. Conclusion Findings were reassuring and suggested that HE and HU participants had similar development. Developmental differences may, however, only emerge with age, therefore large-scale longitudinal research is recommended. It is suggested that the entire sample was vulnerable, highlighting the importance of developmental surveillance in low-income contexts, irrespective of HIV and antiretroviral exposure status.","de Beer, Carmen Cornelia; Krüger, Esedra; van der Linde, Jeannie; Eccles, Renata; Graham, Marien Alet",African health sciences,32,4

A scale of ten questions was used to assess the risk of bias in prevalence studies. Fourteen studies were selected. The population studies' size ranged from 147 to 20,342 children with different socio-economic backgrounds, such as urban, peri-urban and rural settings, socio-economic status, schooling, population (ethnic minorities and indigenous), and environmental differences (sea level or high altitude). The prevalence of OW/OB ranged from 4.9% to 42%. The prevalence of anemia was from 3.4% to 67%. The double burden, including OW/OB and anemia, ranged from 0.7% to 67%. A higher prevalence of excess weight and anemia was found in rural and high altitude above sea level environments, extreme poverty, low education level, and indigenous communities. These heterogeneous data, before the 2020 (COVID-19 pandemic), reflect the vast inequities between countries and within each country. Food insecurity linked to poverty and the induced change in eating habits and lifestyles threaten optimal child nutrition in ongoing and future scenarios. The existence of OW/OB and anemia and their simultaneous coexistence in the community, home, and individual levels, indicates that interventions should be comprehensive to face the double burden of malnutrition.","Shimabuku, Roberto L; Delgado, Carlos A; Nakachi, Graciela; Teruya, Alberto A; Velasquez, Pablo M",The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,32,12

We investigated whether RV infection is a major cause of neonatal fever and compared the clinical characteristics of bacterial infection, viral infection and unknown causes of neonatal fever. METHOD We reviewed the electronic medical records of 48 newborns aged ≤28 days who were admitted to the Special Care Nursery of Hanyang University Guri Hospital for fever (≥38°C) from 2005 to 2009. All the newborns underwent complete blood count, urinalysis, C-reactive protein, cultures of blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid as well as stool RV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction for cough or rhinorrhea, and stool culture for diarrhea were also done. RESULTS All the babies were term, with mean age 13 ± 8 days and peak body temperature 38.5 ± 0.5°C. The causes of neonatal fever were viral (44%), bacterial (10%) and unknown (46%). The viral infections included RV (n = 12), enterovirus (n = 6), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 2), and rhinovirus (n = 1). All the rotavirus genotypes were G4P[6]. Only three of 12 RV-infected febrile newborns had diarrhea. The bacterial infections included three cases of urinary tract infection (Escherichia coli, n = 2; Klebsiella pneumoniae, n = 1), and two cases of sepsis complicated with meningitis (all Streptococcus agalactiae). CONCLUSIONS RV infection is the most common single cause of neonatal fever.

METHODS A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data between August 2006 and October 2008 was performed for patients undergoing HS and RFA at a single institution. QoL was assessed with a questionnaire preoperatively, at 3 months postoperatively and annually thereafter. Recurrence was assessed by Duplex ultrasound annually after surgery. RESULTS A total of 272 patients completed the questionnaire at 3 months. Among these patients, 155 patients returned for their annual follow-up. There were no significant differences between HS and RFA in global QoL scores, although RFA showed less pain. However, paresthesia rates were also higher after RFA.

METHOD Using appropriate keywords, we identified relevant studies in PubMed, the Cochrane library, and Embase. Key pertinent sources in the literature were also reviewed, and all articles published through July 2019 were considered for inclusion. For each study, we assessed odds ratios, mean difference, and 95% confidence interval to assess and synthesize outcomes. RESULT Twenty-one randomized controlled trials were eligible for this meta-analysis with a total of 3636 patients. Compared with decompression, decompression and fusion significantly increased length of hospital stay, operative time and estimated blood loss. Compared with fusion, decompression significantly decreased operative time, estimated blood loss and overall visual analogue scale (VAS) scores. Compared with endoscopic decompression, microscopic decompression significantly increased length of hospital stay, and operative time. Compared with traditional surgery, endoscopic discectomy significantly decreased length of hospital stay, operative time, estimated blood loss, and overall VAS scores and increased Japanese Orthopeadic Association score. Compared with TLIF, MIS-TLIF significantly decreased length of hospital stay, and increased operative time and SF-36 physical component summary score. Compared with multi-level decompression and single level fusion, multi-level decompression and multi-level fusion significantly increased operative time, estimated blood loss and SF-36 mental component summary score and decreased Oswestry disability index score. Compared with decompression, decompression with interlaminar stabilization significantly decreased operative time and the score of Zurich claudication questionnaire symptom severity, and increased VAS score. CONCLUSION Considering the limited number of included studies, we still need larger-sample, high-quality, long-term studies to explore the optimal therapy for lumbar spinal stenosis.","Yang, Li-Hui; Liu, Wei; Li, Jian; Zhu, Wen-Yi; An, Li-Kun; Yuan, Shuo; Ke, Han; Zang, Lei",Medicine,32,11

RECENT FINDINGS A tension-free primary closure should be our aim. In most of the cases, we need to perform a component separation technique, alone or combined, to the use of a synthetic mesh. If those options are not feasible, the abdominal wall composite vascularized allograft transplant (AW-CVA) utilizing direct orthotopic vascularization can be considered. The nonvascularized abdominal rectus fascia has also become an alternative method used worldwide, proving to be simple and well tolerated procedure. Furthermore, the use of the AW has been recently proposed as a new tool for a sentinel monitoring of the intestinal or pancreas allograft. SUMMARY There are different validated options for abdominal wall closure following intestinal transplantation. The long-term benefits of transplanting the abdominal wall, full or partial thickness and vascularized or nonvascularised, were shown. New developments might help to expand their applications in different areas such as reconstructive surgery and immunology.","Gondolesi, Gabriel E; Aguirre, Nicolás F",Current opinion in organ transplantation,32,31

METHODS Pretreatment digital subtraction angiograms and post-treatment noncontrast enhanced computed tomographic scans from the MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands) trial were evaluated for areas lacking capillary blush and with tissue hypodensity, respectively. Because the superior and middle zones of the CIS correspond to the 7 cerebral cortex regions of the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT (ASPECT) score, capillary blush was scored in these 2 zones (0-2), called sub-CIS, and compared with the ASPECT score in these 7 regions (0-7), called hypodensity score. The presence and extent of hypodensity were compared between sub-CIS zones with contingency tables and nonparametric comparisons between groups, respectively. RESULTS On the basis of a sample size of 50 subjects, 100% with sub-CIS <2 had the presence of hypodensity (hypodensity score ≥1) versus 57% for sub-CIS=2 (P=0.004). The extent of hypodensity (numeric hypodensity score) was significantly lower for sub-CIS=2 than 0 or 1 (P=0.02). For 42 subjects with revascularization data, the presence and extent of hypodensity were significantly lower for sub-CIS=2 plus good revascularization than for other combinations of sub-CIS and revascularization (P=0.02 and 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The absence of capillary blush on pretreatment digital subtraction angiogram seems to correspond to nonviable cerebral tissue. Successful revascularization reduces the chance of tissue hypodensity (infarction), when capillary blush is present. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.trialregister.nl.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a therapist-supported method for CCBT in comparison to standard cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). METHODS A total of 154 drug-free major depressive disorder outpatients were randomly assigned to either 16 weeks of standard CBT (up to twenty 50-min sessions) or CCBT using the Good Days Ahead program (including up to 5.5 h of therapist contact). Outcomes were assessed at baseline, weeks 8 and 16, and at 3 and 6 months post-treatment. Economic analyses took into account the costs of services received and work/social role impairment. RESULTS In the context of almost identical efficacy, a form of CCBT that used only about one third the amount of therapist contact as conventional CBT was highly cost-effective compared to conventional therapy and reduced the adjusted cost of treatment by USD 945 per patient. CONCLUSIONS A method of CCBT that blended internet-delivered modules and abbreviated therapeutic contact reduced the cost of treatment substantially without adversely affecting outcomes. Results suggest that use of this approach can more than double the access to CBT. Because clinician support in CCBT can be provided by telephone, videoconference, and/or email, this highly efficient form of treatment could be a major advance in remote treatment delivery.","Thase, Michael E; McCrone, Paul; Barrett, Marna S; Eells, Tracy D; Wisniewski, Stephen R; Balasubramani, G K; Brown, Gregory K; Wright, Jesse H",Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,32,1

To address this gap, the current study used a longitudinal design to assess direct and indirect effects of fatigue and depression on HRQoL in a one-year follow-up survey. A sample of 210 PwMS from the nationwide Swiss MS Registry was used. HRQoL was assessed using the European Quality of Life 5-Dimension 5-Level questionnaire. Path analysis on HRQoL, with fatigue and depression as predictors, was applied. Fatigue was measured by the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), including physical, cognitive and psychosocial subscales, and non-somatic depressive symptomatology was examined with the Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen (BDI-FS). Fatigue acted as a fully mediating variable (B = -0.718, SE = 0.253) between non-somatic depressive symptomatology and HRQoL. This indirect effect became apparent in the physical (B = -0.624, SE = 0.250), psychosocial (B = -0.538, SE = 0.256) and cognitive subscales (B = -0.485, SE = 0.192) of fatigue. In contrast, non-somatic depressive symptomatology did not act as a mediator. Our findings provide novel and clinically relevant longitudinal evidence showing that the debilitating effect of non-somatic aspects of depression on HRQoL was fully mediated and therefore explainable via fatigue.","Rodgers, Stephanie; Manjaly, Zina-Mary; Calabrese, Pasquale; Steinemann, Nina; Kaufmann, Marco; Salmen, Anke; Chan, Andrew; Kesselring, Jürg; Kamm, Christian P; Kuhle, Jens; Zecca, Chiara; Gobbi, Claudio; von Wyl, Viktor; Ajdacic-Gross, Vladeta",Brain sciences,32,1

SUBJECTS/METHODS In this multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial, 255 adults with a body mass index of 30-40 kg m-2 were treated and outcomes were assessed up to 12 months. Participants were randomized to endoscopic placement of an intragastric balloon plus lifestyle or lifestyle intervention alone. Balloons were removed at 6 months and lifestyle intervention continued for both groups through 12 months. At 9 months, coprimary end points were two measures of weight loss. RESULTS At 6 months, weight loss was -3.3% of total body weight (-3.2 kg) in the lifestyle arm vs -10.2% (-9.9 kg) in the balloon plus lifestyle arm (P<0.001); at 9 months (3 months postballoon removal), weight loss was -3.4% (-3.2 kg) vs -9.1% (-8.8 kg, P⩽0.001); and at 12 months, -3.1% (-2.9 kg) vs -7.6% (-7.4 kg, P⩽0.001). For the primary end points, at 9 months, mean percent loss of weight in excess of ideal body weight (s.d.) at 9 months was 26.5% (20.7) (P=0.32) and 9.7% (15.1) in the balloon and control groups, respectively. Also, 45.6% (36.7, 54.8) of the subjects randomized to the balloon achieved at least 15% loss of weight in excess of ideal body weight greater than the control group (P<0.001). The majority of balloon subjects experienced adverse events; 86.9% nausea, 75.6% vomiting, 57.5% abdominal pain and 18.8% had their device removed before 6 months because of an adverse event or subject request. Five subjects (3.1%) in the balloon group had a gastric abnormality at the time of device removal, and no ulcers were found.

We conducted a scoping review of the literature to identify domains and instruments previously used to evaluate these outcomes. DESIGN Scoping review. SETTING We queried PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Registry for studies evaluating pediatric critical care survivors or their families published between 1970 and 2017. We identified articles using key words related to pediatric critical illness and outcome domains. We excluded articles if the majority of patients were greater than 18 years old or less than 1 month old, mortality was the sole outcome, or only instrument psychometrics or procedural outcomes were reported. We used dual review for article selection and data extraction and categorized outcomes by domain (overall health, emotional, physical, cognitive, health-related quality of life, social, family). SUBJECTS Manuscripts evaluating outcomes after pediatric critical illness. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Of 60,349 citations, 407 articles met inclusion criteria; 87% were published after 2000. Study designs included observational (85%), interventional (7%), qualitative (5%), and mixed methods (3%). Populations most frequently evaluated were traumatic brain injury (n = 96), general pediatric critical illness (n = 87), and congenital heart disease (n = 72). Family members were evaluated in 74 studies (18%). Studies used a median of 2 instruments (interquartile range 1-4 instruments) and evaluated a median of 2 domains (interquartile range 2-3 domains). Social (n = 223), cognitive (n = 183), and overall health (n = 161) domains were most frequently studied. Across studies, 366 unique instruments were used, most frequently the Wechsler and Glasgow Outcome Scales. Individual domains were evaluated using a median of 77 instruments (interquartile range 39-87 instruments).

Here we ask in a rodent model of vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) whether improvements to metabolic health are realized in women having received surgical menopause. Specifically we were interested in knowing whether rats made menopausal through surgical means would exhibit persistent hepatic steatosis as reported in previously pregnant, freely cycling female VSG rats or if it is resolved as reported in male VSG rats. METHODS All the rats first received ovariectomy (OVX) and then were placed on high-fat diet before either sham or VSG surgery (N = 12, 9) and then were monitored for resolution of obesity-related comorbidities. RESULTS VSG was sufficient to reduce weight and adiposity in OVX females in comparison to obese rats (P < 0.001). Glucose tolerance (P < 0.05) was improved in OVX-VSG females with no change in insulin sensitivity. Both circulating (P < 0.01) and hepatic triglyceride (P < 0.01) levels were also reduced after VSG. Liver integrity was improved in OVX-VSG in comparison to OVX-obese as reflected by reduced aspartate aminotransferase levels (P < 0.05). The ability of mitochondria to generate adenosine triphosphate was maintained, and an increase in complex IV may decrease the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, VSG in OVX rats experience many positive benefits including the resolution of hepatic steatosis that persists in reproductively intact female rats after VSG.","Lawson, William J; Shirey, Kristin; Spann, Redin A; Zamarripa, Carlos A; Hosler, Jonathan P; Grayson, Bernadette E",Menopause,32,12

To study virus-host cell interactions, we performed a SILAC-based quantitative proteomics study of JEV-infected HeLa cells using a subcellular fractionation strategy. We identified 158 host proteins as differentially regulated by JEV (defined as exhibiting a greater than 1.5-fold change in protein abundance upon JEV infection). The mass spectrometry quantitation data for selected proteins were validated by Western blot and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Bioinformatics analyses were used to generate JEV-regulated host response networks consisting of regulated proteins, which included 35 proteins that were newly added based on the results of this study. The JEV infection-induced host response was found to be coordinated primarily through the immune response process, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), the intracellular membrane system, and lipid metabolism-related proteins. Protein functional studies of selected host proteins using RNA interference-based techniques were carried out in HeLa cells infected with an attenuated or a highly virulent strain of JEV. We demonstrated that the knockdown of interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), Ran-binding protein 2 (RANBP2), sterile alpha motif domain-containing protein 9 (SAMD9) and vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (VAMP8) significantly increased JEV replication.

In this study, we have explored the in vitro antitumor activity of antimicrobial pantinin peptides against the tumor cell lines MDA-MB-231 (breast adenocarcinoma) and DU - 145 (prostate adenocarcinoma) and healthy fibroblasts HGF - 1. To further improve our mechanistic understanding for this class of compounds, we have also performed a biophysical characterization of these peptides in lipid model membranes. Cell viability assays revealed that all peptides were more effective on tumor cells when compared to fibroblasts, indicating selectivity towards cancer cells. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis revealed that all peptides induced apoptosis in cancer cells in a different way from fibroblasts. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that all peptides adopted an α-helical structure and an evaluation of the binding constant indicates a higher affinity of the peptides to negatively charged phospholipids. Additionally, permeabilization assays showed that POPG and POPS anionic vesicles were more susceptible to peptide-induced lysis than POPC:Chol and POPC:POPE vesicles.

In this case, several detection methods have been established based on nucleic acid diagnostic techniques and immunoassays to achieve sensitive and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, most methods are still largely dependent on professional instruments, highly trained operators, and centralized laboratories. These limitations gravely diminish their practicality and portability. Herein, a CRISPR Cas12a based assay was developed for portable, rapid and sensitive of SARS-CoV-2. In this assay, samples were quickly pretreated and amplified by reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification (RT-RAA) under mild conditions. Then, by combining the CRISPR Cas12a system and a glucose-producing reaction, the signal of the virus was converted to that of glucose, which can be quantitatively read by a personal glucose meter in a few seconds. Nucleocapsid protein gene was tested as a model target, and the sensitivity for quantitative detection was as low as 10 copies/μL, which basically meet the needs of clinical diagnosis. In addition, with the advantages of lower material cost, shorter detection time, and no requirement for professional instrument in comparison with qRT-PCR, this assay is expected to provide a powerful technical support for the early diagnosis and intervention during epidemic prevention and control.

To limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through congregate settings, universal testing may be necessary. We aimed to determine the point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a residential treatment program setting and to understand the unique challenges of Covid-19 transmission in this setting. METHODS We performed a case series of SARS-CoV-2 rT-PCR testing via nasopharyngeal in a residential substance use treatment program for women in Boston. Staff and residents of the treatment program were tested for SARS-CoV-2. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 test result. RESULTS A total of 31 residents and staff were tested. Twenty-seven percent (6/22) of the residents and 44% (4/9) of staff tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. All of the SARS-CoV-2 positive residents resided in the same residential unit. Two positive cases resided together with two negative cases in a 4-person room. Two other positive cases resided together in a 2-person room. One positive case resided with two negative cases in a 3-person room. One positive case resided with a negative case in a 2-person room. Based on test results, residents were cohorted by infection status and continued to participate in addiction treatment on-site. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 infection was common among staff and residents within a residential substance use treatment program for women in Boston. Universal SARS-CoV-2 testing in residential substance use programs can be instituted to reduce the risk of further transmission and continue addiction treatment programming when accompanied by adequate space, supplies, and staffing.","Barocas, Joshua A; Blackstone, Elizabeth; Bouton, Tara C; Kimmel, Simeon D; Caputo, Andrea; Porter, Sarah J; Walley, Alexander Y",Journal of addiction medicine,32,24

The psychological impact of CoViD-19 disease must be recognized alongside the physical symptoms for all those affected. Furhermore quarantine for coronavirus has serious psychological side effects, such as depression and anxiety that are more likely to occur and worsen. Furhermore quarantine reduces the availability of psychiatric and psychological interventions. The evidence base for telepsychiatry is growing in adults and adolescents. A growing body of literature suggests that use of telepsychiatry to provide mental health services has the potential to remove geographic barriers between patients and providers and improves quality care. It has increased the volume of patients that physicians can reach and diagnose, as well as allowing them to treat patients.","Prisco, Vincenzo; Prisco, Lorenzo; Donnarumma, Bernadette",Recenti progressi in medicina,32,1

However, dissection at the level of the promontory may be difficult, especially in obese patients, and associated with rare but potential serious morbidity such as life-threatening vascular injury. In an attempt to avoid this risk, we describe a new robotic approach for POP repair with lateral suspension. METHODS From March 2012 through June 2013, ten patients with symptomatic anterior vaginal wall and uterine prolapse were operated by a single surgeon. The video presents the different steps of robotically assisted laparoscopic repair of POP by lateral suspension with mesh and uterine conservation using da Vinci S or Si system. RESULTS POP repair was successfully completed in all ten patients without any perioperative or postoperative complication. CONCLUSION Robotically assisted laparoscopic repair of POP by lateral suspension with mesh is a novel and feasible technique with promising short-term results. It may have several theoretical advantages over sacral colpopexy/hysteropexy and may represent an alternative in cases of difficult dissection of the promontory.","Dällenbach, Patrick; Veit, Nikolaus",International urogynecology journal,32,15

The main cause in 85-90% of the cases is the presence of a solitary parathyroid adenoma. The most common presentation is with asymptomatic hypercalcaemia diagnosed on routine biochemical testing. Although low serum phosphate levels are an associated finding in primary hyperparathyroidism, the diagnostic criteria for PHPT remain to be hypercalcaemia, high or inappropriately normal PTH and hypercalciuria. This case report presents a patient who presented with low phosphate levels without any other biochemical evidence of PHPT, who returned several years later with overt primary hyperparathyroidism. This report intends to raise interest among the medical fraternity whether there is a need to consider hypophosphataemia as an early sign of PHPT. Learning points Primary hyperparathyroidism is a relatively common condition with varying clinical and biochemical presentation. The most common presentations still remain as an asymptomatic biochemical abnormality closely related to calcium, PTH and bone metabolism. Not much attention is usually given to associated biochemical abnormalities, and hence they are usually less investigated. Further research is needed to establish if patients need long-term monitoring when no obvious cause for isolated hypophosphataemia has been found.","Alexander, John; Nagi, Dinesh","Endocrinology, diabetes & metabolism case reports",32,31

Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted of the clinical data, preoperative anti-tuberculosis duration, and postoperative recurrence rate in 263 patients with chest wall tuberculosis spanning 5 years. Results Overall, 263 patients were treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs for about ± 12.49 days during the preoperative period. Simple chest wall tuberculosis was treated for ± 5.87 days and composite chest wall tuberculosis for ± 5.11 days. The postoperative recurrence rate of chest wall tuberculosis was 3.80%, which was close to or lower than the recurrence rate of routine preoperative anti-tuberculous therapy in patients subjected to ultra-short-range anti-tuberculosis treatment before surgery. Conclusion Preoperative ultra-short-course chemotherapy combined with surgical treatment of chest wall tuberculosis did not increase the recurrence rate of chest wall tuberculosis; moreover, it could effectively shorten hospitalization time and improve patient compliance. Full-line anti-tuberculosis treatment and complete resolution of tuberculosis infections are crucial to curing chest wall tuberculosis.","Zhang, Weidong; Chen, Jingfang; Wu, Xiaoming; Chen, Luyu; Wei, Jinxing; Xue, Mingqiang; Liu, Yuanyuan; Liang, Qingzheng",Infection and drug resistance,32,6

The impact of remifentanil in this relationship is poorly quantified in children. Derivation of an integrated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic propofol model, containing remifentanil pharmacodynamic interaction information, enables propofol effect-site target-controlled infusion in children with a better prediction of its hypnotic effect when both drugs are combined. AIMS We designed this study to derive an integrated propofol pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model in children and to describe the pharmacodynamic interaction between propofol and remifentanil on the electroencephalographic bispectral index effect. METHODS Thirty children (mean age: 5.45 years, range 1.3-11.9; mean weight: 23.5 kg, range 8.5-61) scheduled for elective surgery with general anesthesia were studied. After sevoflurane induction, maintenance of anesthesia was based on propofol and remifentanil. Blood samples to measure propofol concentration were collected during anesthesia maintenance and up to 6 hours in the postoperative period. Bispectral index data were continuously recorded throughout the study. A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model was developed using population modeling. The Greco model was used to examine the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interaction between propofol and remifentanil for BIS response RESULTS: Propofol pharmacokinetic data from a previous study in 53 children were pooled with current data and simultaneously analyzed. Propofol pharmacokinetics were adequately described by a three-compartment distribution model with first-order elimination. Theory-based allometric relationships based on TBW improved the model fit. The Greco model supported an additive interaction between propofol and remifentanil. Remifentanil showed only a minor effect in BIS response. CONCLUSION We have developed an integrated propofol pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model that can describe the pharmacodynamic interaction between propofol and remifentanil for BIS response. An additive interaction was supported by our modeling analysis.","Fuentes, Ricardo; Cortínez, Luis Ignacio; Contreras, Víctor; Ibacache, Mauricio; Anderson, Brian J",Paediatric anaesthesia,32,24

The population was composed of all COVID-19 cases confirmed from April 14th to August 31st, 2020. The source used to collect data was the COVID-19 Monitoring Panel from the National Prison Department. Descriptive analysis, scan statistics, and time series were performed. A total of 18,767 COVID-19 cases were reported among the incarcerated population, 4,724 in São Paulo. The scan statistic analysis resulted in 14 spatial risk clusters for COVID-19 among persons deprived of liberty; the highest-risk cluster was in the Federal District. Although the country ends the series with a decreasing behavior, a growing trend was verified in most of the study period. The conclusion is that there is a need to implement mass testing among the incarcerated population while continually monitoring and recording COVID-19 cases.","Crispim, Juliane de Almeida; Ramos, Antônio Carlos Vieira; Berra, Thaís Zamboni; Santos, Márcio Souza Dos; Santos, Felipe Lima Dos; Alves, Luana Seles; Costa, Fernanda Bruzadelli Paulino da; Arcêncio, Ricardo Alexandre",Ciencia & saude coletiva,32,17

To reduce this risk, combined postoperative mechanical and chemical thromboprophylaxis has been routinely performed after HFS in these patients. This retrospective case-control study was conducted to evaluate the additional effectiveness of preoperative mechanical thromboprophylaxis for the prevention of VTE following HFS in elderly patients. METHODS Of 539 consecutive patients aged 70 years or older undergoing HFS, 404 (control group) did not receive preoperative mechanical thromboprophylaxis, while 135 (study group) received mechanical thromboprophylaxis using an intermittent pneumatic compression device and graduated compression stockings from the time of admission until surgery. All patients received combined postoperative mechanical and chemical thromboprophylaxis following HFS in accordance with the same protocol. The incidence of symptomatic VTE confirmed based on clinical symptoms and 3-dimensional CT angiography within one month of surgery was investigated in both groups. RESULTS The American Society of Anesthesiologists grade was higher (p = 0.016) in the study group and more patients in this group had concomitant cardiovascular and neurologic diseases (p = 0.005 and p = 0.009, respectively). In addition, more patients in the study group had received anticoagulant medication preinjury owing to comorbidities (39% vs 28%, p = 0.025). The overall incidences of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) were 7.4% and 3.7%, and 2.2% and 1.5% in the control and study groups, respectively. According to multiple logistic regression, symptomatic DVT significantly reduced in the study group (OR 0.28, p = 0.042), while there was no significant difference in the incidence of symptomatic PE between the two groups (p = 0.223). CONCLUSIONS Preoperative mechanical thromboprophylaxis may confer an additional benefit by preventing postoperative VTE without adding more risk of perioperative bleeding in elderly patients with hip fracture.","Nam, Ji-Hoon; Kim, Dae-Hwan; Yoo, Je-Hyun; Hwang, Ji-Hyo; Chang, Jun-Dong",PloS one,32,16

As compared to previous works, a high aragonite/biopolymer interfacial strength is observed (~298 MPa). The crack propagation path is investigated via experiment and finite element modelling and compared with the fracture mechanics analysis. It is confirmed that crack deflection to the aragonite/biopolymer interface contributes to a high overall toughness.

Here, we extrapolate the long-term behavior of the epidemic in both countries using a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model, where parameters are stochastically perturbed with a lognormal distribution to handle the uncertainty in the estimates of COVID-19 prevalence and to simulate the presence of super-spreaders. Our results suggest that uncertainties in both parameters and initial conditions rapidly propagate in the model and can result in different outcomes of the epidemic leading or not to a second wave of infections. Furthermore, the presence of super-spreaders adds instability to the dynamics, making the control of the epidemic more difficult. Using actual knowledge, asymptotic estimates of COVID-19 prevalence can fluctuate of the order of 10×106 units in both countries.","Faranda, Davide; Alberti, Tommaso",Chaos,32,24

Improving the patient's immune system in relation to oncological surgery with immunonutrition may play an important role in reducing postoperative infections. A meta-analysis was undertaken to evaluate the potential clinical benefits of immunonutrition on postoperative infections and 30-day mortality in patients undergoing oncological surgery. METHODS PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify eligible studies. Eligible studies had to include patients undergoing elective curative surgery for a solid malignant tumour and receiving immunonutrition orally before surgery, including patients who continued immunonutrition into the postoperative period. The main outcome was overall infectious complications; secondary outcomes were surgical-site infection (SSI) and 30-day mortality, described by relative risk (RR) with trial sequential analysis (TSA). Risk of bias was assessed according to Cochrane methodology. RESULTS Some 22 RCTs with 2159 participants were eligible for meta-analysis. Compared with the control group, immunonutrition reduced overall infectious complications (RR 0·58, 95 per cent c.i. 0·48 to 0·70; I2 = 7 per cent; TSA-adjusted 95 per cent c.i. 0·28 to 1·21) and SSI (RR 0·65, 95 per cent c.i. 0·50 to 0·85; I2 = 0 per cent; TSA-adjusted 95 per cent c.i. 0·21 to 2·04). Thirty-day mortality was not altered by immunonutrition (RR 0·69, 0·33 to 1·40; I2 = 0 per cent). CONCLUSION Immunonutrition reduced overall infectious complications, even after controlling for random error, and also reduced SSI. The quality of evidence was moderate, and mortality was not affected by immunonutrition (low quality). Oral immunonutrition merits consideration as a means of reducing overall infectious complications after cancer surgery.","Buzquurz, F; Bojesen, R D; Grube, C; Madsen, M T; Gögenur, I",BJS open,32,20

Currently, life-sustaining home ventilators can work with a single, lighter circuit that is easier to manage. Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a single-limb circuit with intentional leaks (passive circuit) in comparison with a circuit with an expiratory valve (active circuit), in subjects with ALS who use invasive home ventilation. METHODS We conducted a retrospective single-center study. The enrolled subjects were divided into 2 groups according to the type of exhalation port. The aim of the study was to compare arterial blood gases; nocturnal oxygen saturation recordings; and the occurrence of adverse events, both clinical and technical events. In addition, we compared the rate of mortality and unplanned hospital admissions that occurred within a year after discharge from the hospital. RESULTS Forty-three subjects were included in our study: 23 who used a passive circuit and 20 who used an active circuit. No significant difference in nocturnal and diurnal gas exchanges was detected. The incidence of adverse events was significantly higher in the active circuit group (85% in active circuit vs 30% in passive circuit, P < .001). However, by splitting the adverse events into 2 categories, clinical and technical, the technical events were significantly more frequent in the active circuit group. None of these events led to hospital admission or death. CONCLUSIONS The passive circuit was shown to be as effective and safe as the active circuit during home invasive ventilation in the subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A future randomized controlled study is necessary to confirm these results and to extend indications to other pathologies.","De Mattia, Elisa; Falcier, Elisa; Lizio, Andrea; Lunetta, Christian; Sansone, Valeria A; Barbarito, Nicola; Garabelli, Barbara; Iatomasi, Marino; Roma, Elisabetta; Rao, Fabrizio; Carlucci, Annalisa",Respiratory care,32,1

Maintaining these test centers requires considerable investment in human and financial resources. Additionally, it can be challenging for individuals outside North America to become FLS certified. The objective of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of remotely administering and scoring the FLS examination using live videoconferencing compared with standard onsite testing. METHODS This parallel mixed-methods study used both FLS scoring data and participant feedback to determine the barriers to feasibility of remote proctoring for the FLS examination. Participants were tested at two accredited FLS testing centers. An official FLS proctor administered and scored the FLS exam remotely while another onsite proctor provided a live score of participants' performance. Participant feedback was collected during testing. Interrater reliabilities of onsite and remote FLS scoring data were compared using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Participant feedback was analyzed using modified grounded theory to identify themes for barriers to feasibility. RESULTS The scores of the remote and onsite proctors showed excellent interrater reliability in the total FLS (ICC 0.995, CI [0.985-0.998]). Several barriers led to critical errors in remote scoring, but most were accompanied by a solution incorporated into the study protocol. The most common barrier was the chain of custody for exam accessories. CONCLUSION The results of this pilot study suggest that remote administration of the FLS has the potential to decrease costs without altering test-taker scores or exam validity. Further research is required to validate protocols for remote and onsite proctors and to direct execution of these protocols in a controlled environment identical to current FLS test administration.","Okrainec, Allan; Vassiliou, Melina; Kapoor, Andrew; Pitzul, Kristen; Henao, Oscar; Kaneva, Pepa; Jackson, Timothy; Ritter, E Matt",Surgical endoscopy,32,24

METHODS A prospective randomized crossover study was conducted with 18 paramedics to examine intubation performance of two blind intubation techniques through a supraglottic airway devices (IGI and laryngeal mask airway Fastrach), compared with use of a Macintosh laryngoscope (MCL). Each intubation was conducted at two levels of patient positions (ground- and stretcher-level). Primary outcomes were the intubation time and the success rate for intubation. RESULTS The intubation time (sec) of each intubation technique was not significantly different between the two positions. In both patient positions, the intubation time of IGI was shortest among the three intubation techniques (17.9±5.2 at the ground-level and 16.9±3.8 at the stretcher-level). In the analysis of cumulative success rate and intubation time, IGI was the fastest to reach 100% success among the three intubation techniques regardless of patient position (all P<0.017). The success of intubation was only affected by the intubation technique, and IGI achieved more success than MCL (odds ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 11.6; P=0.03). CONCLUSION The patient position did not affect intubation performance. Additionally, the intubation time with blind intubation through supraglottic airway devices, especially with IGI, was significantly shorter than that with MCL.","Kim, Jae Guk; Kim, Wonhee; Kang, Gu Hyun; Jang, Yong Soo; Choi, Hyun Young; Kim, Hyeongtae; Kim, Minji",Clinical and experimental emergency medicine,32,1

METHODS A total of 9015 students in middle schools in Beijing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, and Urumqi completed the Chinese version of the GSHS. Researchers analyzed the results from 2 questions about the frequency and form of being bullied and 11 questions about psychosocial adjustment. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used in the analysis. RESULTS About 25.7% of middle school students reported being bullied on 1 or more of the past 30 days. Rates of being bullied were similar for males and females, but the forms of being bullied were different. Being bullied was significantly lower in Beijing than in the other 3 cities. There were significant psychosocial differences between students who had been bullied and students who had not been bullied. Students who had been involved in a physical fight, often felt lonely, or had considered suicide in the past 30 days were more likely to report being bullied. Students who thought that other students in their school were often kind and helpful, who felt parents often understood their troubles, or who were taught in school how to handle stress were less likely to report being bullied. CONCLUSIONS Being bullied is not uncommon in Chinese middle schools. Chinese schools typically place great emphasis on academic achievement, perhaps at the expense of the social climate of the school. Results indicated schools could implement changes to the school climate to reduce the likelihood of students' being bullied.","Cheng, Yulan; Newman, Ian M; Qu, Ming; Mbulo, Lazarous; Chai, Yan; Chen, Yan; Shell, Duane F",The Journal of school health,32,9

Maintenance therapy following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has shown substantial promise. Enasidenib (ENA), a selective IDH2 inhibitor, was associated with impressive rates of response in relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML and is now FDA-approved for this indication. We sought to assess the tolerability and define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ENA as maintenance following HCT for IDH2-mutated myeloid malignancy. HCT-eligible patients (pts) ≥ 18 years with AML in remission, or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with <5% marrow blasts, were enrolled. There were no restrictions on conditioning or donor type. A 2-step registration process was utilized;1 before HCT and 1 before ENA initiation. Before HCT, pts were required to have normal organ and recovered marrow function (neutrophils > 1000/µL and platelets > 50000/µL). Those with prior HCT, active disease, QTc ≥450ms, and active infections were excluded. ENA was initiated between day 30 and 90 after HCT, at which time the following were required: chimerism ≥70% of donor origin among blood/marrow cells, no acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) requiring ≥0.5mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent, and no relapse. ENA was taken orally (po) daily (qd) in 28-day cycles. The period for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation was the first cycle, escalation to successive levels was guided by DLT incidence, and 2 levels (50mg,100mg) were studied. Following establishment of MTD or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), 10 pts would be enrolled in an expansion cohort. Pts were monitored for relapse and toxicity and continued until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or receipt of 12 cycles. Nineteen pts have been registered prior to HCT at 3 sites, Massachusetts General Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and Johns Hopkins Hospital. Three pts could not initiate ENA following HCT;2 due to logistic challenges of the COVID pandemic and 1 due to relapse. The remaining 16 pts initiated ENA treatment. The median age was 61 years (range 31-76);12 (75%) were male, and 13 (81%) were Caucasian. Fourteen (88%) had AML, of which 6 were AML with MDS related changes and 2 had antecedent myeloproliferative neoplasm. Two pts (13%) had MDS. Among these 16 pts, 9 (56%) had IDH2 R140, and 5 (25%) had IDH2 R172 mutations. IDH2 subtype data was unavailable for 2 pts. Of 15 pts with available data from time of diagnosis, 11 (73%) had intermediate-risk and 4 (27%) had adverse-risk cytogenetics. Among these 15 pts, common concurrent mutations were DNMT3A (47%), SRSF2 (33%), and RUNX1 (33%). Eleven AML pts (85%) received intensive versus non-intensive therapies (15%) prior to HCT, and among all pts, 7 (44%) had received ENA prior to HCT. HCT data was available for all 16 pts;4 pts (25%) received myeloablative, and 12 (75%) received reduced-intensity conditioning. Nine pts (56%) had a matched unrelated, 6 (38%) had haploidentical, and 1 (6%) had a matched related donor HCT. Three pts were enrolled at the 50mg dose level, 6 pts at 100mg, and after no DLTs were detected, the remaining were enrolled in an expansion cohort at 100mg qd. Median follow-up (F/U) for surviving patients is currently 11.7 months (range 1.5-18.9). 2 pts (13%) have relapsed during F/U, at 96 and 364 days post HCT. Additional ≥grade (G) 3 toxicities detected during treatment, possibly or probably related to ENA, included neutropenia, anemia, and bilirubinemia. Six pts (38%) required dose interruptions lasting a median 19 days (range 7-25), 4 required a dose reduction to 50mg, and 1 stopped treatment due to G3 bilirubinemia. In total, 3 pts (18%) discontinued study treatment, 1 for aforementioned G3 bilirubinemia, 1 to pursue a GVHD trial, and 1 for relapse. Six pts have completed the 12-month f/u without relapse, and 7 remain on study. 15 of 16 pts remain alive. Thus far, 3 pts have experienced ≥ G2 aGVHD, and 4 had moderate chronic GVHD. Serial me surement of 2HG is being conducted on samples, and these will be reported. Enasidenib is well-tolerated as post-HCT maintenance therapy for myeloid malignancy at the RP2D of 100mg qd. No DLTs have been detected, and a low rate of post-HCT relapse has been identified to date, although longer f/u is needed. Larger, randomized studies of ENA in the post-SCT setting would determine the true efficacy of this agent as maintenance therapy.

The literature suggests that self-monitoring of blood glucose paired with telemedicine consultations is an effective strategy for diabetes management, however it is unclear whether telemedicine remains effective in the context of the sudden lifestyle changes caused by the pandemic, including non-essential service closures, travel restrictions, lockdowns, and psychosocial impacts. Patients with diabetes are uniquely affected by these restrictions, as glycemic control is heavily dependent on lifestyle and access to essential medications and supplies. The purpose of this project is to determine the impact of telemedicine consultations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic on the glycemic control of patients seen at our clinic. A retrospective chart review was performed on 300 type 1 and 2 diabetes patients seen at least once within the 6 months preceding (pre-COVID) and following (post-COVID) March 18, 2020. The primary outcome measure was hemoglobin A1c. For patients with more than 1 A1c value in each time frame, the most recent A1c was used. Demographic information was also collected. There was no significant difference in the pre-COVID and post-COVID A1c values (p=0.40) of the entire sample. There was no significant difference in the pre-COVID and post-COVID A1c values when the sample was stratified by age, diabetes duration, use of CGM, or use of pump. However, there was a significant increase in A1c for females post-COVID (p<0.05). This difference was not observed for males (p=0.22). Our data suggests that telemedicine is an overall effective strategy for optimizing glycemic control of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes during the pandemic, with no significant difference in A1c. However, the gender-specific effect of telemedicine consultations during COVID-19 on the glycemic control of females with diabetes indicates a need for further study and intervention.","Dissanayake, Ashini Pawlowska Monika Schroeder Benjamin MacKenzie-Feder Jessica White Adam",Diabetes,32,28

Identifying the association between medications taken prior to the infection of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) might be useful during the current pandemic until a proven treatment is developed. We aimed to determine whether the risk of developing COVID-19 was associated with the use of various drugs that may increase or decrease susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and COVID-19. Methods and Findings: A case-control study was performed using a nationwide claims database of South Korea, where a large testing capacity has been available throughout the pandemic. Exposure was defined as the prescription of study drugs that would have been continued until 7 days before the testing for COVID-19. Adults were considered eligible if they were >=18 years old and tested for COVID-19. Among the 65,149 eligible subjects (mean age, 48.3 years; 49.4% male), 5,172 (7.9%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine was not significantly associated with the risk of COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.48; 95% CI, 0.95-2.31). In the overall population, lower risks of COVID-19 were associated with the use of camostat (aOR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.20-1.02) and amiodarone (aOR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.33-0.89), although the differences were not significant in the subgroup analyses. Angiotensin receptor blockers were also associated with a slightly increased risk of COVID-19 (aOR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.26), which was also not observed in the subgroup analysis. The study limitations include potential bias regarding the controls' characteristics, inability to determine prescription compliance, and a lack of information regarding the severity of underlying conditions. Conclusions. No medications were consistently associated with increased or decreased risks of COVID-19. These findings suggest that a more cautious approach is warranted for the clinical use of re-purposed drugs until the results are available from clinical trials.","Huh, Kyungmin; Ji, Wonjun; Kang, Minsun; Hong, Jinwook; Bae, Gi Hwan; Lee, Rugyeom; Na, Yewon; Choi, Hyoseon; Gong, Seon Yeong; Jung, Jaehun",,32,1

Here, we characterized the magnitude and specificity of SARS-CoV-2 spike-reactive antibodies from 10 acutely infected health care workers and 23 participants who received mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We found that infection and primary mRNA vaccination elicited S1 and S2-reactive antibodies, while secondary vaccination boosted mostly S1 antibodies. Using magnetic bead-based absorption assays, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infections elicited a large proportion of original antigenic sin-like antibodies that bound efficiently to common seasonal human coronaviruses but poorly to SARS-CoV-2. In converse, vaccination only modestly boosted antibodies reactive to common seasonal human coronaviruses and these antibodies bound efficiently to SARS-CoV-2.

Here, we monitored the SARS-CoV-2 specific immune response in convalescent coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients up to 15 months after symptoms onset. Methods The levels of anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain antibodies and neutralizing activities were tested in a total of 188 samples from 136 convalescent patients who experience mild to critical COVID-19. Specific memory B and T cell responses were measured in 76 peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples collected from 54 patients. Twenty-three vaccinated individuals were included for comparison. Findings Following a peak at day 15-28 post-infection, the IgG antibody response and plasma neutralizing titers gradually decreased over time but stabilized after 6 months. Plasma neutralizing activity against G614 was still detected in 87% of the patients at 6-15 months. Compared to G614, the median neutralizing titers against Beta, Gamma and Delta variants in plasma collected at early (15-103 days) and late (9-15 month) convalescence were 16- and 8-fold lower, respectively. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B and T cells reached a peak at 3-6 months and persisted in the majority of patients up to 15 months although a significant decrease in specific T cells was observed between 6 and 15 months. Conclusion The data suggest that antiviral specific immunity especially memory B cells in COVID-19 convalescent patients is long-lasting, but some variants of concern, including the fast-spreading Delta variant, may at least partially escape the neutralizing activity of plasma antibodies.

The strict actions to enclose the epidemic have exposed many households to inner tensions. Domestic violence has been reported to increase during the lockdown. However, the reasons for this phenomenon have not been thoroughly investigated. Melanocortin GPCRs family contribution to aggression is well documented. ASIP (nonagouti) gene plays a vital role in regulating the melanocortin GPCRs family function, and it is responsible for regulating aggression in mice. We conducted a selection analysis of ASIP. We found that it negatively purified from Shark to humans. In order to better asses the effect of this gene in mammals, we performed RNA-seq analysis of a knockout of an ASIP crisper-cas mouse model. We found that ASIP KO in mice upregulates several genes controlling auditory function, including Phox2b, Mpk13, Fat2, Neurod2, Slc18a3, Gon4l Gbx2, Slc6a3(Dat1) Aldh1a7 Tyrp1 and Lbx1. Interestingly, we found that Slc6a5, and Lamp5 as well as IL33, which are associated with startle disease, are also upregulated in response to knocking out ASIP. These findings are indicative of a direct autoimmune effect between aggression-associated genes and startle disease. Furthermore, in order to validate the link between aggression and auditory inputs processing. We conducted psychological tests of persons who experienced lockdown. We found that aggression has risen by 16 % during the lockdown. Furthermore, 3% of the subjects interviewed reported a change in their hearing abilities. Our data shed light on the importance of the auditory input in aggression and open perceptions to interpret how hearing and aggression interact at the molecular neural circuit level.","Mickael, Alexandra; Klimovich, Pavel; Henckel, Patrick; Kubick, Norwin; Mickael, Michel E",bioRxiv,32,16

Moreover, the chapter explains why this crisis is unprecedented, making it dangerous in terms of financial stability and state finances and difficult for central banks to return to normality. In the current crisis, central banks find themselves in an ambiguous situation. On the one hand, they are better prepared than they were thirteen years ago when the GFC erupted. On the other hand, relying on experience from the GFC comes with risks. No two crises are ever the same, and this is especially true for the Covid-19 pandemic.

Simple screening tools are available to assess asthma control. Asthma control test is a simple numerical scoring system that can be easily used on a routine basis. Latest Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines stress that asthma control is the main objective of asthma treatment. In this COVID pandemic situation, there is an hesitancy in performing and undergoing pulmonary function tests among physicians and the patients. Hence, in this study was planned to correlate the asthma control test values with FEV1 and other parameters like Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR), Absolute Eosinophil Count (AEC) and serum magnesium. Aim: To study the correlation between asthma control test and FEV1;To study the correlation between asthma control test and other parameters like PEFR, AEC and Serum magnesium. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted at Department of Pulmonary Medicine. It is a cross-sectional observational study done from February 2019 to January 2020. Sample size was 55. Patients of Bronchial Asthma in line with GINA Guidelines were included in the study. Results: Asthma control test had positive correlation with FEV1 with a spearman's correlation of 0.2758 and p-value of 0.0414 which was statistically significant. The spearman's correlation between Asthma control test and AEC was -0.4583 with a p-value of &lt;0.001, which was significant.

Design/methodology/approach This study employed a combinatory methodology to analyze how 124 Brazilian SMEs configured - before and during the pandemic - the size of their working capital and their levels of dependency on clients and suppliers. Findings High levels of working capital and supplier diversification were found to be key to SMEs' ability to thrive before and during the pandemic. However, while SMEs that were growing prior to the pandemic depended on a few major customers, firms flourishing during this time have divided their sales among many clients. Research limitations/implications This study focuses on what configurations SMEs have adopted during the crisis. Qualitative studies are needed to identify how SMEs reconfigure themselves in the face of a major crisis. Practical implications The results of this study indicate that SMEs hit by the pandemic should avoid retrenchment strategies.

However, the impact of telecommuting on diet is not well understood. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between telecommuting frequency and unhealthy dietary habits among Japanese workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A total of 33,302 Japanese workers completed an Internet survey about telecommuting and dietary habits. Data from 13,468 office workers who telecommuted were analyzed. Telecommuting frequency during the COVID-19 pandemic was extracted from a questionnaire. The odds ratios (ORs) of four types of dietary habits, namely, skipping breakfast, solitary eating, lower meal frequency, and meal substitution associated with telecommuting frequency were estimated using multilevel logistic regression. Results: The multivariate OR of skipping breakfast was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.03-1.29, p=0.013) for participants who telecommuted in excess of four days per week compared to those who rarely telecommuted. Similarly, the multivariate OR of solitary eating, lower meal frequency and meal substitution were 1.44 (95%CI: 1.28-1.63, p<0.001), 2.39 (95%CI: 1.66-3.44, p<0.001), and 1.26 (95%CI: 1.04-1.51, p=0.015) for those who telecommuted in excess of four days per week compared to those who rarely telecommuted. There was a statistically significant increase in the dose-response trend in ORs of solitary eating (p for trend <0.001), lower meal frequency (p for trend <0.001), and meal substitution (p for trend =0.001) with increasing telecommuting frequency. Conclusion: Increasing telecommuting frequency was associated with an increasing number of unhealthy dietary habits in Japanese workers. Telecommuting during the COVID-19 pandemic, together with other social changes such as refraining from going out and socializing, is having a significant impact on workers' daily lives and behaviors. This study suggests that in addition to challenges related to physical activity, loneliness, and mental health, telecommuters may also be developing unhealthy dietary habits, indicating the need for strategies to help telecommuters manage their nutrition and diet.","Kubo, Y.; Ishimaru, T.; Hino, A.; Nagata, M.; Ikegami, K.; Tateishi, S.; Tsuji, M.; Matsuda, S.; Fujino, Y.",,32,16

A regression analysis was used to compare the relative importance of clusters derived from a K-means cluster analysis as well as various demographics (age, gender, level of education, political affiliation, a factor reflecting social security and a factor reflecting the lockdown harshness). Three distinct clusters (General Population, Extreme Responders and Sufferers) were identified, corresponding well to a previous study. Clusters appeared to be the best overall predictors of coping and adherence although gender, political affiliation and lockdown harshness were also important predictors. The large proportion of variance that remains unexplained, combined with the relatively weak effects of traditional demographics, suggest that less concrete variables such as personality traits, health and environmental factors may be better predictors of adherence and coping during a pandemic.","Van Belle, S.

We aimed to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infection risk through respiratory transmission using a quantitative microbial risk assessment framework by retrieving SARS-CoV-2 concentrations from the swab tests of 251 Thai patients. Three virus-generating scenarios were investigated: an infector breathing, breathing with a cough, and breathing with a sneeze. Infection risk (97.5th percentile) was as high as 10−3 with breathing and increased to 10−1 with a cough or sneeze, thus all higher than the risk benchmark of 5 × 10−5 per event. No significant gender differences for toilet users (receptors) were noted. The highest risk scenario of breathing and a sneeze was further evaluated for risk mitigation measures. Risk mitigation to lower than the benchmark succeeded only when the infector and receptor simultaneously wore an N95 respirator or surgical mask and when the receptor wore an N95 respirator and the infector wore a denim fabric mask. Ventilation up to 20 air changes per hour (ACH), beyond the 12-ACH suggested by the WHO, did not mitigate risk. Virus concentration, volume of expelled droplets, and receptor dwell time were identified as the main contributors to transmission risk. Highlights - The use of public toilets poses a risk of SARS-CoV-2 respiratory transmission - Highest risks generated in the order of sneezing, coughing, and breathing - No gender differences in risk by counteracting dwell times and inhalation rates - Ventilation did not reduce risk even at 20 ACH, beyond the WHO-recommended value - N95 and surgical masks offer the most effective risk mitigation to toilet users Graphical abstract","Denpetkul, Thammanitchpol; Sittipunsakda, Oranoot; Pumkaew, Monchai; Mongkolsuk, Skorn; Sirikanchana, Kwanrawee",bioRxiv,32,1

The natural compounds obtained from medicinal plants have been proven to be the source of many treatments throughout history. Efforts to combat Sars-CoV-2 generally focused on repositioning drugs or finding treatments with natural compounds and have been rapidly ongoing. Main protease (Mpro) is a vital protein of SARS-CoV-2 and an important target of drug research. The present study evaluated seven artemisinin derivatives: artemisinin, artemether, arteether, artesunate, dihydroartemisinic acid, dihydroartemisinin and artemisinic acid. For this purpose, the molecular docking study was carried out to investigate the potency of artemisinin derivatives against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. As a result, artesunate, dihydroartemisinic acid and dihydroartemisinin had promising results in Mpro inhibition with the binding energies between-8.42 and-9.35 kcal/mol. © 2021, TUBITAK.

This article examines the public debates surrounding the initial development of the German Corona-Warn-App in 2020 as a case study to analyse such questions at the intersection of trust and trustworthiness in technology development, design and oversight. Providing some insights into the nature and dynamics of trust and trustworthiness, we argue that (a) trust is only desirable and justified if placed well, that is, if directed at those being trustworthy;that (b) trust and trustworthiness come in degrees and have both epistemic and moral components;and that (c) such a normatively demanding understanding of trust excludes technologies as proper objects of trust and requires that trust is directed at socio-technical assemblages consisting of both humans and artefacts. We conclude with some lessons learned from our case study, highlighting the epistemic and moral demands for trustworthy technology development as well as for public debates about such technologies, which ultimately requires attributing epistemic and moral duties to all actors involved.

This virus genotype, called C-type SARS-CoV-2, was almost exclusively prevalent in the United States from March to July 2020. This type of virus, characterized by a pair of the C17747T (P504L) and A17858G (Y541C) mutations on the nsp13 gene, had never been highly prevalent at any other time or in any other part of the world. In the U.S., Washington State was the center of the epidemic, and the C-type viruses, along with the viruses with wild-type helicase, seemed to have aroused the pandemic. In Washington State, USA, the CoViD-19 epidemic during the first two months of the year, starting at the end of February 2020, was mainly caused by the type-C virus. During this period, the infection spread rapidly; from May onwards, the number of viruses with wild-type helicases became higher than that of type-C viruses, and no type-C viruses have been collected since early July. The involvement of the helicase in this COVID-19 disease was discussed.","Miyake, J.; Yoshino, M.; Sato, T.; Niioka, H.; Sakata, Y.; Nakazawa, Y.",,32,12

In 1-3%, the patients declare a hearing loss. Studies in asymptomatic, PCR-positive patients showed a significant hearing loss in the high frequency range. The aim of our follow-up study is to objectify a possible hearing loss in patients tested positive for Covid-19 and to follow it over time. Methods The following tests will be done within the study: ENT examination, audiometry, TPOAE and DPOAE, ERA and ASSR. As a control group, we used ISO 7029:2017 for normal hearing. The examinations are performed after 1, 3 and 6 months after the initial presentation. Results So far 48 patients have been included in the study. In the preliminary analysis, 12 patients reported a subjective hearing loss due to Covid-19 infection. In two patients deafness could be verified. The air conduction threshold (0.25-6kHz) is significantly worse on both sides than in normal hearing patients (p<0.05);especially in the high frequency range (≥4kHz). In the ASSR, a significantly higher threshold for 0.5;1 and 2kHz (p<0.05) was found compared to the normal values. In stimulation with 4kHz only the threshold on the left is higher, on the right a significance is missed. Conclusion In our preliminary analysis, 25% of patients reported subjective new hearing loss. Objectively, a significant hearing loss in the high frequency range on both sides was found. This could be related to the Covid-19 infection. Thus, a hearing loss due to a Covid-19 infection should be considered and further diagnostics and therapy should be initiated.","Gerstacker, K.; Speck, I.; Schill, R.; Riemann, S.; Knopf, A.; Aschendorff, A.; Arndt, S.",Laryngo- Rhino- Otologie,32,1

Despite decades of study, the behavior of the pulmonary surfactant is poorly understood on the molecular scale, which hinders the development of effective surfactant replacement therapies, useful in the treatment of several lung-related diseases. In this work, we combined all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, Langmuir trough measurements, and AFM imaging to study synthetic four-component lipid monolayers designed to model protein-free pulmonary surfactant. We characterized the structural and dynamic properties of the monolayers with a special focus on lateral heterogeneity. Remarkably, simulations reproduce almost quantitatively the experimental data on pressure–area isotherms and the presence of lateral heterogeneities highlighted by AFM. Quite surprisingly, the pressure–area isotherms do not show a plateau region, despite the presence of liquid-condensed nanometer–sized domains at surface pressures larger than 20 mN/m. In the simulations, the domains were small and transient, but they did not coalesce to yield a separate phase. The liquid–condensed domains were only slightly enriched in DPPC and cholesterol, and their chemical composition remained very similar to the overall composition of the monolayer membrane. Instead, they differed from liquid-expanded regions in terms of membrane thickness (in agreement with AFM data), diffusion rates, acyl chain packing, and orientation. We hypothesize that such lateral heterogeneities are crucial for lung surfactant function, as they allow both efficient packing, to achieve low surface tension, and sufficient fluidity, critical for rapid adsorption to the air–liquid interface during the breathing cycle.","Liekkinen, Juho; de Santos Moreno, Berta; Paananen, Riku O.; Vattulainen, Ilpo; Monticelli, Luca; de la Serna, Jorge Bernardino; Javanainen, Matti",bioRxiv,32,16

According to the world health organization, detecting the patients/carriers is by the far the most important action to prevent the pandemic. Recently, the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique has become more popular due to the easy handling of a one-step kit used for the detection of many diseases than RT-PCR-based techniques. Methods: Herein, we used the RT-LAMP technique so as to detect COVID-19. To this end, 40 paired-samples of patients and healthy people had been collected and tested by RT-PCR for N and E genes of SARS-CoV-2. The RT-LAMP test has been performed on samples for the RdRp gene. The sensitivity and specificity of tests have been determined. Results: The testing results are consistent with the conventional RT-qPCR. Additionally, we also showed that a one-step process without RNA extraction is feasible to achieve RNA amplification directly from a sample. Conclusion: We confirmed that RT-LAMP is a rapid, simple, and sensitive method that can be used as a large-screening method, particularly in regional hospitals with limited access to high-technologies.","Ghazimoradi, M.

This could benefit both students with and without special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), yet to date no studies evaluated these practices in inclusive educational settings. Here we report the findings of two consecutive studies: a pilot single-group pre-post (Study 1) and a non-randomised controlled study of RP training vs no-intervention control condition (Study 2). Across both studies, 531 students (46.5% female) with a mean age of 11.43 years (SD = 1.27) enrolled in the study at pre-test, of which 13.9% had a confirmed diagnosis of SEND and a further 5.7% were considered by teachers to likely have SEND. School and classroom climate, as well as victimisation experiences, emotional well-being and social inclusion of students were assessed using self-report questionnaires. Easy enrolment of schools and students at pre-test indicated that studies investigating the effects of RP training could be feasible. However, in part due to COVID-19 related school closures, student attrition rates of 90 and 77% were observed, for Study 1 and Study 2 respectively. In spite of observed improvements in classroom climate for the intervention group in Study 2, statistical analyses yielded no significant effects of the intervention and there were no moderation effects of students’ perceived inclusion and victimisation experiences. Together, these studies provide the first quantitative student data on implementing RP in an inclusive educational setting. We discuss our findings in light of the need for ideas on how to reduce attrition and also consider longer school-wide and single-class implementations of RP. © Copyright © 2021 Weber, Rehder and Vereenooghe.","Weber, C.; Rehder, M.; Vereenooghe, L.",Frontiers in Education,32,11

During the A/H1N1 pandemic, healthcare workers presented concerns regarding their own and their families' health, as well as high levels of psychological distress. We aim to assess hospital trainees' concerns, perceived sufficiency of information, behaviour and reported psychological health during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN Single 39-point questionnaire. SETTING A large NHS foundation trust in London. PARTICIPANTS 204 hospital trainee doctors. RESULTS 204 trainees participated, of whom 91.7% (n=187) looked after COVID-19 patients. 91.6% (n=164) were worried about COVID-19; the most frequent concern was that of family and friends dying from COVID-19 (74.6%, n=126). 22.2% (n=36) reported being infected with COVID-19. 6.8% (n=11) of trainees considered avoiding going to work. Perceived sufficiency of information about COVID-19 was moderately high. 25.9% (n=42) reported social distancing at work compared with 94.4% (n=152) outside work. 98.2% (n=159) reported using PPE and 24.7% (n=40) were confident the provided PPE protected them. 41.9% (n=67) reported their psychological health had been adversely affected. 95.6% (n=153) supported provision of psychological support services and 62.5% (n=100) stated they would consider using them. CONCLUSIONS A significant proportion of hospital trainees expressed worries about COVID-19, above all with regards to the wellbeing of their loved ones over their own. Confidence in sufficiency of provided information was high and in utilised infection control measures low. A larger proportion of trainees reported psychological as compared with physical health concerns, with a smaller proportion confirming having been infected with COVID-19 although most perceived their risk of infection as high. Seeking solutions to support hospital trainees in their duties and their wellbeing with their input would help to empower them and improve their health and morale while working during pandemics.","Aziminia, N; Khani, A; Smith, C; Bakhai, A; Lisk, C",Acute medicine,32,19

DATA SOURCES We searched MEDLINE(R), Cochrane Collaboration resources, and Embase. REVIEW METHODS We included studies published in English from February 2000 through August 2006. We excluded studies with low sample size (based on study design, cases series < 100 and cohorts < 40) or lack of relevance to uterine fibroids. Of 107 included studies, 3 were good quality, 56 fair, and 48 poor. RESULTS The cumulative incidence by age 50 is 70 percent to 80 percent; black women are more likely to get fibroids at younger ages. Appearance of new fibroids and growth of existing fibroids after treatment are poorly studied. Trials of preoperative medical management indicate that treatment reduces fibroid volume but do not provide sufficient evidence of improvement in important operative outcomes. When women are treated for reasons other than symptom relief, such as when pregnancy is desired, weak evidence supports treating submucous fibroids via hysteroscopy. No well-conducted trials in U.S. populations directly compared treatment options, including the option of expectant management, or followed women to determine whether the intervention met their treatment objectives. Common procedures such as hysterectomy and myomectomy, including choice among types of myomectomy, still cannot be meaningfully compared. Studies comparing uterine artery embolization (UAE) with other procedures reported procedure time and length of stay favoring UAE, but inconsistency of the direction of effect for complications and absence of key information on longer-term outcomes suggest that this evidence base is inadequate to comment on the relative risks and benefits of UAE versus hysterectomy or myomectomy. Costs of fibroid treatment, despite shorter average lengths of stay, are rising. CONCLUSIONS The dearth of high-quality evidence supporting the effectiveness of most interventions for uterine fibroids is remarkable, given how common this problem is.

Previously we have shown that monoclonal antibodies targeting the ectodomain of the A/M2 proton channel have antiviral activity in vitro. In this study, we generated both monoclonal antibody and phage displayed peptide against the eight amino acids comprising the ectodomain of the BM2 proton channel and investigated their antiviral activities in vitro. A cytopathic assay showed that the monoclonal antibody potently protected MDCK cells from homologous, but not heterologous, virus infections. A plaque forming assay showed that viral replication was not completely neutralized, but greatly inhibited, by the monoclonal antibody. In contrast, no antiviral activity was observed for the synthetic native or engineered peptides. These results indicate that antibody targeting the M2 proton channel is a promising therapeutic candidate for treating influenza virus infections, and that antibody structure is important for antiviral activity.","Wang, Yongjin; Xu, Hongwei; Wu, Nannan; Shi, Huiling; Wang, Xiaoming; Wang, Tianhou",The new microbiologica,32,1

Cellular and physiologic mechanisms maintaining pulmonary homeostasis during lung injury remain poorly understood. In the present study, the Stat-3 gene was selectively deleted in respiratory epithelial cells by conditional expression of Cre-recombinase under control of the surfactant protein C gene promoter. Cell-selective deletion of Stat-3 in respiratory epithelial cells did not alter prenatal lung morphogenesis or postnatal lung function. However, exposure of adult Stat-3-deleted mice to 95% oxygen caused a more rapidly progressive lung injury associated with alveolar capillary leak and acute respiratory distress. Epithelial cell injury and inflammatory responses were increased in the Stat-3-deleted mice. Surfactant proteins and lipids were decreased or absent in alveolar lavage material. Intratracheal treatment with exogenous surfactant protein B improved survival and lung histology in Stat-3-deleted mice during hyperoxia. Expression of Stat-3 in respiratory epithelial cells is not required for lung formation, but plays a critical role in maintenance of surfactant homeostasis and lung function during oxygen injury.","Hokuto, Isamu; Ikegami, Machiko; Yoshida, Mitsuhiro; Takeda, Kiyoshi; Akira, Shizuo; Perl, Anne-Karina T; Hull, William M; Wert, Susan E; Whitsett, Jeffrey A",The Journal of clinical investigation,32,16

Isolates of NIB virus (NIBV)--DMV/1639/11, DMV/3432/11, and DMV/3902/11--were characterized by sequence analysis of the N-terminal subunit (S1) of the spike (S) gene. Findings indicated that the isolates were identical to each other and to PA/9579A/10, a 2010 isolate from poultry in Pennsylvania. The 2010 and 2011 isolates appear to have originated from a 1997-2000 NIB outbreak in Pennsylvania. DMV/1639/11 and PA/9579A/10 were determined to be nephropathogenic in susceptible chickens, yielding virus reisolations from kidney and inducing characteristic interstitial nephritis microscopic lesions. In a controlled laboratory study, 40% of chickens vaccinated with a combination live vaccine containing infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains Massachusetts (Mass) + Connecticut (Conn) were positive on virus isolation attempts after challenge with DMV/1639/11, compared with only 13% of Mass + Arkansas (Ark) vaccinates. Both combination vaccines gave partial protection against the development of DMV/1639/11-induced renal lesions. Although numerically fewer chickens vaccinated with Mass + Conn had interstitial nephritis compared with those vaccinated with Mass + Ark, neither vaccine combination offered greater protection (P < 0.05) than observed in unvaccinated chickens challenged with DMV/1639/11. Mass + Ark vaccinations, applied under commercial conditions in the hatchery (spray) and on-farm (spray), did not protect the trachea or kidney from DMV/1639/11 challenge.

The incubation of living fibroblasts with an anti-CD13 antibody on ice gave punctate labeling that was evenly distributed on the cell surface, but raising the temperature to 37 degrees C before fixation caused aggregation of the labeling. The aggregated labeling of CD13 colocalized with caveolin-1 in most cells. The HCoV-229E virus particle showed a binding and redistribution pattern that was similar to that caused by the anti-CD13 antibody: the virus bound to the cell evenly when incubated on ice but became colocalized with caveolin-1 at 37 degrees C; importantly, the virus also caused sequestration of CD13 to the caveolin-1-positive area. Electron microscopy confirmed that HCoV-229E was localized near or at the orifice of caveolae after incubation at 37 degrees C. The depletion of plasmalemmal cholesterol with methyl beta-cyclodextrin significantly reduced the HCoV-229E redistribution and subsequent infection. A caveolin-1 knockdown by RNA interference also reduced the HCoV-229E infection considerably. The results indicate that HCoV-229E first binds to CD13 in the Triton X-100-resistant microdomain, then clusters CD13 by cross-linking, and thereby reaches the caveolar region before entering cells.","Nomura, Ryuji; Kiyota, Asuka; Suzaki, Etsuko; Kataoka, Katsuko; Ohe, Yoshihide; Miyamoto, Kaoru; Senda, Takao; Fujimoto, Toyoshi",Journal of virology,32,16

The left renal vein was completely occluded by the tumor thrombus in all cases. In order to ligate the left renal artery first behind the dilated left renal vein, we must dissect the left kidney with arterial blood flow. Massive bleeding from the numerous engorged collateral veins around the left kidney is inevitable. Furthermore, access to the left renal artery is difficult because of the large tumor. We therefore initially divided the left renal vein without arterial blood flow followed by division of the left renal artery. After nephrectomy by dissecting the tumor without blood flow we extirpated the intracaval tumor thrombus. The median time of the operation was 7 hours 35 minutes and the median amount of blood loss was 2,869 ml. The tumor stage was pT3b in four cases and pT3c in two cases. No complications were observed during and after surgery except for one case of lymphocele and another case of chylous ascites. The initial division of the left renal vein is considered to be a useful surgical approach in left renal cancer with occluded left renal vein, especially when the tumor is large.","Kurosawa, Kazuhiro; Okita, Ryuji; Motoshima, Takanobu; Fujioka, Masashi; Abe, Hiromitsu; Morikawa, Hirofumi; Okaneya, Toshikazu; Komatsu, Hideki",Hinyokika kiyo.

The goal of this study was to describe the exercise capacity and underlying exercise limitations of mechanically ventilated post-COVID-19 patients in clinical rehabilitation. DESIGN A retrospective cohort study. METHOD Twenty-four post-COVID-19patients that were mechanically ventilated at ICU and thereafter admitted for clinical rehabilitation performed a symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) with breath-by-breath gas-exchange monitoring, ECG-registration, blood pressure- and saturation monitoring. In absence of a primary cardiac or ventilatory exercise limitation patients were considered to be limited primarily by decreased peripheral muscle mass. RESULTS Twenty-three patients could perform a maximal exercise test and no adverse events occurred. Cardiorespiratory fitness was very poor with a median peak oxygen uptake of 15.0 [10.1-21.4] mlO2/kg/min (57% of predicted values). However, we observed large differences within the group in both exercise capacity and exercise limitations. While 7/23 patients were primarily limited by ventilatory function, the majority (70%) was limited primarily by the decreased peripheral muscle mass. CONCLUSION Cardiorespiratory fitness of post-COVID-19 patients in clinical rehabilitation is strongly deteriorated. The majority of patients seemed primarily limited for exercise by the decreased peripheral muscle mass.","Blokland, Ilse J; Ilbrink, Shanna; Houdijk, Han; Dijkstra, Jan-Willem; van Bennekom, Coen A M; Fickert, Richard; de Lijster, René; Groot, Floor P",Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,32,1

By immunofluorescence microscopy, Cx43-HKKSL transiently transfected into HeLa cells showed a predominantly ER localization, although Cx43-AKKFF was localized to the perinuclear region of the cell. Sucrose gradient analysis of Triton X-100-solubilized connexins showed that either Cx43-HKKSL or Cx43-AKKFF expressed alone by HeLa cells was maintained as an apparent monomer. In contrast to Cx43-HKKSL, Cx32-HKKSL was maintained in the ER as stable hexamers, consistent with the notion that Cx32 and Cx43 oligomerization occur in distinct intracellular compartments. Furthermore, Cx43-HKKSL and Cx43-AKKFF inhibited trafficking of Cx43 and Cx46 to the plasma membrane. The inhibitory effect was because of the formation of mixed oligomers between Cx43-HKKSL or Cx43-AKKF and wild type Cx43 or Cx46. Taken together, these results suggest that Cx43-HKKSL and Cx43-AKKFF recirculate through compartments where oligomerization occurs and may be maintained as apparent monomers by a putative Cx43-specific quality control mechanism.","Das Sarma, Jayasri; Wang, Fushan; Koval, Michael",The Journal of biological chemistry,32,16

A significantly greater proportion of recently diagnosed individuals were interested in being involved when it comes to decisions about their HIV treatment compared with any other group (72.8% [399/548], 63.1% [576/913], and 62.6% [581/928], diagnosis year: 2017-2019, 2010-2016, and pre-2010 respectively) but reported less understanding of their treatment compared with those reporting the longest duration (66.8% [366/548], 68.6% [626/913], and 77.3% [717/928], respectively). One-third of PLHIV with salient treatment-related concerns were uncomfortable discussing with providers. Of participants who felt that their HIV medication limited their life but did not discuss their concerns with their provider (n = 203), top reasons for not discussing were: perception nothing could be done (49.3% [100/203]), provider never brought up the issue (37.9% [77/203]), and not wanting to appear difficult (30.5% [62/203]). To continue to identify and address unmet treatment needs among PLHIV, providers need to ensure that there is ongoing open dialogue.","Okoli, Chinyere; Brough, Garry; Allan, Brent; Castellanos, Erika; Young, Benjamin; Eremin, Anton; Corbelli, Giulio Maria; Mc Britton, Marta; Muchenje, Marvelous; Van de Velde, Nicolas; de Los Rios, Patricia",AIDS behav,32,3

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of various treatment modalities in nCOV-2019 patients. METHODS: A literature search was conducted before 29 June 2020 in PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane library databases. A fixed-effect model was applied if I2 < 50%, else results were combined using random-effect model. Risk ratio (RR) or standardized mean difference (SMD) along with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was used to pool the results. Between-study heterogeneity was explored using influence and sensitivity analyses, and publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. Entire statistical analysis was conducted in R version 3.6.2. RESULTS: Fifty studies involving 15 in vitro and 35 clinical studies including 9170 nCOV-2019 patients were included. Lopinavir-ritonavir was significantly associated with shorter mean time to clinical recovery (SMD -0.32; 95% CI -0.57 to -0.06), remdesivir was significantly associated with better overall clinical recovery (RR 1.17; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.29), and tocilizumab was associated with less all-cause mortality (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.93). Hydroxychloroquine was associated with longer time to clinical recovery and less overall clinical recovery. It additionally had higher all-cause mortality and more total adverse events. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggests that except in vitro studies, no treatment has shown overall favourable outcomes in nCOV-2019 patients. Lopinavir-ritonavir, remdesivir and tocilizumab may have some benefits, while hydroxychloroquine administration may cause harm in nCOV-2019 patients. Results from upcoming large clinical trials may further clarify role of these drugs.","Misra, Shubham; Nath, Manabesh; Hadda, Vijay; Vibha, Deepti",Eur J Clin Invest,32,20

Another aspect is deciding which COVID-19 symptom is more likely to show positive result of virus contamination. The virus has been declared as a pandemic and has affected more than 66,729,375 people across 220 countries and has also cost the lives of 1,535,982 people [source : who.int] as of the time this paper is being written. Research still predicts that another second wave is to hit soon. The required objective is obtained using complex machine learning algorithms that are able to predict, up to an extent the probability that the person has covid-19 and also if the related covid-19 symptoms provided are relevant to the condition or not. The algorithm used is a LOGISTIC REGRESSION algorithm that is used as a classification tool to separate the data into binary results, which in our case is if the person has covid-19 or not (YES OR NO). The dataset used to train this machine learning algorithm is obtained from online resources and a public survey.The machine learning model as of now has been able to predict the probability of virus contamination by 66.89% accuracy, further the model is able to relate if a given symptom is valid or not. With this we are able to conclude that the model is working fine and only fine tuning of the model is required in order to improve and enhance the accuracy and probability of exact results. The result were then improved using ANN( Artificial Neural Networks) but as it is computational expensive and due to lack of resources the expected performance cannot be met.

Methods: We use data provided by Korea Disease Control & Prevention Agency, National Medical Center, which include the clinical and epidemiological patient data of all patients hospitalized with COVID-19, who were discharged on, or prior to, April 30, 2020, in South Korea. We conducted comorbidity network and multinomial logistic regression analyses to identify risk factors associated with the severity of and mortality from COVID-19 disease. The outcome variable is the categorized clinical severity scores (CSS): mild case (O2 treatment not needed), severe case (O2 treatment needed), and death. Results: A total of 5,771 patients were included. In the fully adjusted model, chronic kidney disease (CKD); odds ratio, 2.59 [95% CI, 1.19 to 5.61] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); odds ratio, 3.19 [95% CI, 1.35 to 7.52] were significantly associated with case severity. The following were associated with an increased risk of death: CKD; odds ratio, 5.35 [95% CI, 2.00 to 14.31], Heart failure (HF) odds ratio, 3.15 [95% CI, 1.22 to 8.15], malignancy odds ratio, 3.38 [95% CI, 1.59 to 7.17], dementia odds ratio, 2.62 [95% CI, 1.45 to 4.73], and diabetes odds ratio, 2.26 [95% CI, 1.46 to 3.49]. Asthma and hypertension were associated with an increased risk of death, although this was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Underlying diseases have different contributions to the severity of COVID-19 disease. To efficiently allocated limited medical resources, underlying comorbidities should be closely monitored, particularly chronic kidney disease (CKD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure (HF) in the past.","Shin, Eun Kyong; Choi, Hyo Young; Hayes, Neil",Epidemiol Health,32,24

Two tasks were studied in this present paper. One was to segment the mask of intact lung in case of pneumonia. Another was to generate the masks of regions infected by COVID-19. The masks of these two parts of images then were converted to corresponding volumes to calculate the physical proportion of infected region of lung. A total of 129 CT image set were herein collected and studied. The intrinsic Hounsfiled value of CT images was firstly utilized to generate the initial dirty version of labeled masks both for intact lung and infected regions. Then, the samples were carefully adjusted and improved by two professional radiologists to generate the final training set and test benchmark. Two deep learning models were evaluated: UNet and 2.5D UNet. For the segment of infected regions, a deep learning based classifier was followed to remove unrelated blur-edged regions that were wrongly segmented out such as air tube and blood vessel tissue etc. For the segmented masks of intact lung and infected regions, the best method could achieve 0.972 and 0.757 measure in mean Dice similarity coefficient on our test benchmark. As the overall proportion of infected region of lung, the final result showed 0.961 (Pearson's correlation coefficient) and 11.7% (mean absolute percent error). The instant proportion of infected regions of lung could be used as a visual evidence to assist clinical physician to determine the severity of the case. Furthermore, a quantified report of infected regions can help predict the prognosis for COVID-19 cases which were scanned periodically within the treatment cycle.","Wu, Wei; Shi, Yu; Li, Xukun; Zhou, Yukun; Du, Peng; Lv, Shuangzhi; Liang, Tingbo; Sheng, Jifang",,32,1

Manufacturer information indicates a specificity of about 95% and there is a growing interest to use these tests area-wide. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify whether AgPOCT can be used safely for ""rule-in"" (detection of positive patients) and for ""rule-out"" (valid negative testing). Two thousand three hundred and seventy-five patients received polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and AgPOCT for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) regardless of symptoms. The positive predictive value of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients was compared with a cut-off threshold cycle (Ct ) value of &#8804;30 and in total. Five hundrded and fifty-one patients tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus by PCR, of whom 35.2% presented without symptoms. In all patients, regardless of their symptoms or Ct values, a sensitivity of 68.9% and a specificity of 99.6% were calculated for AgPOCT. In patients with Ct values &#8804;30, a sensitivity of 80.5% (95% confidence interval: ±1.62) and a specificity of 99.6% were shown for all tests (symptomatic/asymptomatic). Highly infectious patients (Ct &#8804; 20), regardless of symptoms, were reliably detected by the AgPOCT. In infectious patients with Ct values &#8804;30, the test has a sensitivity of about 80% regardless of COVID-19 typical symptoms, which is apparently less than the 96.52% specificity indicated by the manufacturer. Relevant improvement in test sensitivity by querying the patients who are symptomatic and asymptomatic is also not feasible.

(Special Issue: COVID-19.),10.932329,8.569193,2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is responsible for the largest pandemic since the 1918 influenza A virus subtype H1N1 influenza outbreak. The symptoms presently recognized by the World Health Organization are cough, fever, tiredness, and difficulty breathing. Patient-reported smell and taste loss has been associated with COVID-19 infection, yet no empirical olfactory testing on a cohort of COVID-19 patients has been performed. METHODS: The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), a well-validated 40-odorant test, was administered to 60 confirmed COVID-19 inpatients and 60 age- and sex-matched controls to assess the magnitude and frequency of their olfactory dysfunction. A mixed effects analysis of variance determined whether meaningful differences in test scores existed between the 2 groups and if the test scores were differentially influenced by sex. RESULTS: Fifty-nine (98%) of the 60 patients exhibited some smell dysfunction (mean [95% CI] UPSIT score: 20.98 [19.47, 22.48]; controls: 34.10 [33.31, 34.88]; p < 0.0001). Thirty-five of the 60 patients (58%) were either anosmic (15/60; 25%) or severely microsmic (20/60; 33%); 16 exhibited moderate microsmia (16/60; 27%), 8 mild microsmia (8/60; 13%), and 1 normosmia (1/60; 2%).

The key feature of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, is upper respiratory tract infection, which may be complicated by bilateral pneumonia. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a key host factor, required for virus entry into cells. Interestingly, ACE2 is expressed not only in the respiratory system, but also in the other organs and systems including adrenal glands. Here we provide the first description of the pathomorphological changes in adrenal glands in patients with severe COVID-19 characterized by perivascular infiltration of CD3+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes. Due to the central role of the adrenals in the stress response of the organism, this finding is of potential clinical relevance, because infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus might critically impair adrenal function under pathophysiological conditions.","Zinserling, Vsevolod A; Semenova, Natalya Yu; Markov, Alexander G; Rybalchenko, Oksana V; Wang, Jun; Rodionov, Roman N; Bornstein, Stefan R",Horm Metab Res,32,20

The efficient replication and population spread of SARS-CoV-2 indicates an effective evasion of human innate immune responses, although the viral proteins responsible for this immune evasion are not clear. In this study, we identified SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, accessory proteins, and the main viral protease as potent inhibitors of host innate immune responses of distinct pathways. In particular, the main viral protease was a potent inhibitor of both the RLR and cGAS-STING pathways. Viral accessory protein ORF3a had the unique ability to inhibit STING, but not the RLR response. On the other hand, structural protein N was a unique RLR inhibitor. ORF3a bound STING in a unique fashion and blocked the nuclear accumulation of p65 to inhibit nuclear factor-&#954;B signaling. 3CL of SARS-CoV-2 inhibited K63-ubiquitin modification of STING to disrupt the assembly of the STING functional complex and downstream signaling. Diverse vertebrate STINGs, including those from humans, mice, and chickens, could be inhibited by ORF3a and 3CL of SARS-CoV-2. The existence of more effective innate immune suppressors in pathogenic coronaviruses may allow them to replicate more efficiently in vivo. Since evasion of host innate immune responses is essential for the survival of all viruses, our study provides insights into the design of therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2.","Rui, Yajuan; Su, Jiaming; Shen, Si; Hu, Ying; Huang, Dingbo; Zheng, Wenwen; Lou, Meng; Shi, Yifei; Wang, Meng; Chen, Shiqi; Zhao, Na; Dong, Qi; Cai, Yong; Xu, Rongzhen; Zheng, Shu; Yu, Xiao-Fang",Signal Transduct Target Ther,32,20

Left to market forces, such unfair practices are likely to aggravate hardships and increase the loss of lives. Thus, there is a critical need to ensure safe distribution of food and essential supplies to all citizens to sustain them through challenging times. To this end, we propose a simple, affordable and contact-less robotic system for preparing and dispensing food and survival-kits at community scale.

The human colon adeno-carcinoma cell line, CACO-2, has been previously used for the growth of multiple influenza viruses, including seasonal, novel and avian lineages. OBJECTIVE: We compared CACO-2, Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK), and RhMK cells for the isolation of viruses from patients presenting with influenza like-illness (ILI). STUDY DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal specimens from patients with ILI in primary care settings were processed for conventional viral culture in MDCK, RhMK, and CACO-2. Cells were examined microscopically for cytopathic effect (CPE) and confirmatory testing included immunofluorescent antigen (IFA) detection and real-time RT-PCR. Additionally, 16 specimens positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) by PCR were inoculated on CACO-2 cells. Statistical analysis was done using Chi-square test with IBM Statistical Program. RESULTS: Of 1031 respiratory specimens inoculated, viruses were isolated and confirmed from 331 (32.1 %) in MDCK cells, 304 (29.5 %) in RhMk cells, and 433 (42.0 %) in CACO-2 cells. These included influenza A/(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), influenza B, parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1, 2, and 3, human coronavirus 229E (CoV-229E), human adenovirus (HAdV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV 1), and enterovirus (EV). Influenza A viruses grew best in the CACO-2 cell line. Time to observation of CPE was similar for all three cell types but unlike RhMK and MDCK cells, virus-specific morphological changes were indistinguishable in CACO-2 cells. None of the 16 specimens positive for RSV by PCR grew on CACO-2 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The overall respiratory virus culture isolation rate in CACO-2 cells was significantly higher than that in RhMK or MDCK cells (p < 0.05). CACO-2 cells also supported the growth of some viruses that did not grow in either RhMK or MDCK cells. Except for RSV, CACO-2 cells provide a worthwhile addition to culture algorithms for respiratory specimens.","Ramani, Rama; Laplante, Jennifer M; Church, Theresa M; Farrell, Gregory M; Lamson, Daryl M; St George, Kirsten",J Virol Methods,32,20

Method We collected and analyzed all the epidemiologic and virological diagnostic details of the infected individuals released by public health authorities and reiterated every episode of outbreak on a timeline. All individuals associated with the five outbreaks had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results In this study, all five COVID-19 outbreaks reported in China since October 2020 were analyzed. The Kashgar outbreak in Xinjiang province came into light for the first time on October 22, 2020. However, it was initiated before October 11, 2020, by a local asymptomatic import and export worker, who was infected at the working place. Subsequently, his wife caught the infection, which led to 430 more infections reported in the outbreak. The Beijing outbreak with 41 cases was noticed for the first time on December 22, 2020. However, our analysis revealed that it was initiated by an asymptomatic individual from Indonesia on December 10, 2020. The Shenyang outbreak, with 38 cases, noticed for the first time on December 23, 2020, was initiated by a pre-symptomatic individual from South Korea on December 13, 2020. Conclusion The asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals during the asymptomatic period were unsuspectingly infected by SARS-CoV-2, and unintentionally transmitted the virus to a large number of people. These findings suggest that early detection of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals is of critical importance in preventing future outbreaks or epidemics.","Yang, Caixin Zhang Sihui Lu Shan Yang Jing Cheng Yanpeng Liu Yue Zhao Lijun Gong Jian Xu Jianguo",Journal of Biosafety and Biosecurity,32,3

However, implant malpositioning can still occur, even when intraoperative imaging and navigation are used. In this study, we investigated novel orbital implants containing features facilitating self-centering. Accuracy of implant placement and reconstruction of the orbital dimensions were compared retrospectively between self-centering second-generation patient-specific functionalized orbital implants (study group) and CAD-based individualized implants (control group). Design features of implants in the study group included functionalization with navigation tracks, a preventive design, and flanges - so called stabilizers - towards opposite orbital walls. Implant position was evaluated by fusion of preoperative virtual plans and the post-therapeutic imaging. Aberrances were quantified by 3D heatmap analysis. 31 patients were assigned to the study group and 50 to the control group, respectively. In the study group, most implants were designed with either one (n = 18, 58.06%) or two (n = 10, 32.26%) stabilizers. Twice (6.45%), one stabilizer had to be shortened intraoperatively. Implant fit analysis revealed a significantly more precise (p < 0.001) positioning in the study group (n = 22/31) than in the control group (n = 42/50). Self-centering second-generation patient-specific functionalized orbital implants showed significantly more accurate implant positioning, facilitating the transformation of virtual plans into patient's anatomy. The presented design provides an additional instrument for intraoperative quality control besides intraoperative imaging and navigation.","Zeller, Alexander-Nicolai; Neuhaus, Michael Tobias; Gessler, Nora; Skade, Sandra; Korn, Philippe; Jehn, Philipp; Gellrich, Nils-Claudius; Zimmerer, Rüdiger M",J.

COVID-19 disease progression include lymphopenia, elevated proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, accumulation of macrophages and neutrophils in lungs, immune dysregulation, cytokine storms, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), etc. Development of vaccines to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and other coronavirus has been difficult to create due to vaccine induced enhanced disease responses in animal models. Multiple betacoronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 expand cellular tropism by infecting some phagocytic cells (immature macrophages and dendritic cells) via antibody bound Fc receptor uptake of virus. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) may be involved in the clinical observation of increased severity of symptoms associated with early high levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients. Infants with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19 may also have ADE caused by maternally acquired SARS-CoV-2 antibodies bound to mast cells. ADE risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 has implications for COVID-19 and MIS-C treatments, B-cell vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 antibody therapy, and convalescent plasma therapy for patients. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies bound to mast cells may be involved in MIS-C and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) following initial COVID-19 infection. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies bound to Fc receptors on macrophages and mast cells may represent two different mechanisms for ADE in patients. These two different ADE risks have possible implications for SARS-CoV-2 B-cell vaccines for subsets of populations based on age, cross-reactive antibodies, variabilities in antibody levels over time, and pregnancy. These models place increased emphasis on the importance of developing safe SARS-CoV-2 T cell vaccines that are not dependent upon antibodies.","Ricke, Darrell O",Front Immunol,32,10

Due to the insidious and complex nature of the disease, the list of symptoms is rapidly expanding. So far, few studies have reported sudden sensorineural hearing loss as a possible symptom of coronavirus disease 2019. CASE REPORT: A 60-year-old woman with a complaint of sudden sensorineural hearing loss and subjective severe tinnitus presented to the ENT clinic. Coronavirus disease 2019 was subsequently confirmed with a polymerase chain reaction test. At the time of presentation, she was treated with intra-tympanic dexamethasone. Improvements in hearing threshold and speech perception, and a subjective reduction in tinnitus, were observed after treatment. CONCLUSION: This case report supports evidence from other case reports of a possible association between coronavirus disease 2019 and sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss may be a symptom of this disease that behaves as an underlying aggravating factor. Intra-tympanic injection of corticosteroids is recommended for managing these patients during the pandemic.","Rahimi, V; Asiyabar, M K; Rouhbakhsh, N",J Laryngol Otol,32,5

Providers and healthcare systems were forced to rapidly create triage schemas in order to preserve resources and reduce potential viral transmission while continuing to provide care for patients. We reviewed United States and international triage proposals from professional societies, peer-reviewed publications, and publicly available institutional guidelines to identify common themes and critical differences. To date, there are varying levels of agreement on the optimal triaging of urologic oncology cases. As the need to preserve resources and prevent viral transmission grows, prioritizing only high priority surgical cases is paramount. A similar approach to prioritization will also be needed as nonemergent cases are allowed to proceed in the coming weeks. While these decisions will often be made on a case-by-case basis, more nuanced surgeon-driven consensus guidelines are needed for the near future.","Shinder, Brian M; Patel, Hiren V; Sterling, Joshua; Tabakin, Alexandra L; Kim, Isaac Y; Jang, Thomas L; Singer, Eric A",Urol Oncol,32,20

Since there is an unprecedented global effort to develop a vaccine against the COVID-19 pandemic, much less is known about its acceptance in the community. Understanding key determinants that influence the preferences and demands of a future vaccine by the community may help to develop strategies for improving the global vaccination program. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine and their determinants among people in Saudi Arabia. Methods: A web-based, cross-sectional study was conducted using snowball sampling strategy under a highly restricted environment. A bilingual, self-administered anonymous questionnaire was designed and sent to the study participants through social media plat-forms and email. Study participants were recruited across the country, including the four major cities (Riyadh, Dammam, Jeddah, and Abha) in Saudi Arabia. Key determinants that predict vaccine acceptance among respondents were modelled using logistic regression analysis. Of the 1000 survey invitees, 992 responded to the survey. Results: Of the 992 respondents, 642 showed interest to accept the COVID-19 vaccine if it is available. Willingness to accept the future COVID-19 vaccine is relatively high among older age groups, being married participants with education level postgraduate degree or higher (68.8%), non-Saudi (69.1%), employed in government sector (68.9%). In multivariate model, respondents who were above 45 years (aOR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.08-3.21) and married (aOR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.28-2.50) were significantly associated with vaccine acceptance (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Addressing sociodemographic determinants relating to the COVID-19 vaccination may help to increase uptake of the global vaccination program to tackle future pandemics. Targeted health education interventions are needed to increase the uptake of the future COVID-19 vaccine.","Al-Mohaithef, Mohammed; Padhi, Bijaya Kumar",J Multidiscip Healthc,32,20

However, little has been described about how National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Centers have transformed integrative oncology care delivery in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this commentary is to describe the delivery of integrative oncology clinical services and conduct of research at The Leonard P. Zakim Center for Integrative Therapies and Healthy Living at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical services transitioned from an array of in-person appointment-based services, such as acupuncture and massage, and group programs, such as yoga and nutrition seminars to a combination of live-streamed and on-demand virtual group programs and one-on-one virtual appointments for services such as acupressure and self-care massage. Group program volume grew from 2189 in-person program patient visits in the 6 months prior to onset of the COVID pandemic to 16,366 virtual (e.g., live-streamed or on-demand) patient visits in the first 6 months of the pandemic. From a research perspective, two integrative oncology studies, focused on yoga and music therapy, respectively, were transitioned from in-person delivery to a virtual format. Participant accrual to these studies increased after the transition to virtual consent and intervention delivery. Overall, our clinical and research observations at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute suggest that the delivery of virtual integrative oncology treatments is feasible and appealing to patients.

In a hyper-connected world, models and analysis of interactions and social behaviors are key to understand and stop outbreaks. Big Data along with apps are enabling for validating and refining models with real world data at scale, as well as new applications and frameworks to map and track diseases in real time or optimize the necessary resources and interventions such as testing and vaccination strategies. Digital epidemiology is positioning as a discipline necessary to control epidemics and implement actionable protocols and policies. In this review we address the research areas configuring current digital epidemiology: transmission and propagation models and descriptions based on human networks and contact tracing, mobility analysis and spatio-temporal propagation of infectious diseases and the emerging field of infodemics that comprises the study of information and knowledge propagation related to epidemics.

Based on the rapid outbreak of COVID-19 in China, this paper empirically tests whether internal control alleviates the negative impact of the pandemic on firm performance. Using a sample of Chinese listed firms from the first quarter of 2019 to the third quarter of 2020 and employing the difference-in-difference (DID) method, we find that the firms with a higher quality of internal control achieve better financial performance during the pandemic period;the more serious the pandemic is, the more obvious effect internal control plays. Furthermore, we consider the industry heterogeneity and firm heterogeneity of the risk resistance effect of internal control. In the manufacturing industry, which is a “disaster zone” of the pandemic, and the non-high-tech industry with a low degree of digitization, internal control can play a more important role in firms’ performance. Moreover, for state-owned enterprises, and firms with strong financing constraints, the role of internal control is more prominent. The above results provide empirical evidence for the risk prevention function of internal control and shed new light on the measures for firms to resist emergencies in the future.","Zhu, Peiqing Song Jianbo",Sustainability,32,27

These conversations have spread various conspiracies about vaccines against COVID-19. It is, therefore, necessary to develop communication strategies, led by official accounts, that offer accessible information on vaccination as a preventive public health strategy. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of public institutions on Twitter campaign #yomevacuno to deal with misinformation about vaccination against COVID-19. METHODS: This paper performs a social network analysis and content analysis of Twitter data, using NodeXL software, from December 8th to 23rd, 2020. Tweets included content #yomevacuno hashtag. RESULTS: A total of 6,080 interactions were collected, 82% were tweets. Data shows that public institutions generate 53.36% of traffic information, the most important was the Ministerio de Sanidad from Spain. Content analysis revealed that 48% of a sample of 50 Tweets the message was focused on vaccination as a social responsibility to defeat COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The communication strategy of #yomevacuno hashtag, has been led by the Ministerio de Sanidad of Spain, by comparison to other campaigns in which there was no large presence of public institutions. This case represents the importance of social media as a way to spread information and prevention, even in public health and the need for them to be led by public organizations rather than by individual users.","Herrera-Peco, I.; Ruiz Nunez, C.; Jimenez-Gomez, B.; Romero-Magdalena, C.

She reflects on representations of ‘the invisible enemy’: an empty category, she claims, which has been contingently filled and morally loaded, resting on pre-existing categories, such as stereotypical representations of nations. The invisibility of ‘the enemy’ has in fact been rendered visible through what she refers to as contingent racism; this includes the ubiquitous and hence powerful use of irony and satire at the expense of China and Italy, but also expands to the use of banal and convenient tropes of accusation and derision among European Union member states, bringing back to the fore the North-South divide and its power imbalances. The author suggests that the Covid-19 crisis has ultimately provoked a veritable epidemic of contingent racism on multiple levels by stirring stereotypes and cultural prejudices which are rooted in time and rapidly renewed; its effect is all but contingent, and likely to accompany us far beyond the Covid-19 crisis itself.","Pellegrino, Manuela",Anthropol.

We aim to identify these inefficiencies and possible solutions as we begin to pursue a move to planned surgical care. Methods: All trauma and orthopaedic emergency surgery were analysed for May 2019 and May 2020. Timing data was collated to look at the following: anaesthetic preparation time, anaesthetic time, surgical preparation time, surgical time, transfer to recovery time and turnaround time. Data for 2019 was collected retrospectively and data for 2020 was collected prospectively. Results: A total of 222 patients underwent emergency orthopaedic surgery in May 2019 and 161 in May 2020. A statistically significant increase in all timings was demonstrated in 2020 apart from anaesthetic time which demonstrated a significant decrease. A subgroup analysis for hip fractures demonstrated a similar result. No increase in surgical time was observed in hand and wrist surgery or for debridement and washouts.Although the decrease in anaesthetic time is difficult to explain, this could be attributed to a reduction in combined anaesthetic techniques and possibly the effect of fear. The other increases in time demonstrated can largely be attributed to the PPE required for aerosol generating procedures and other measures taken to reduce spread of the virus. These procedures currently form a large amount of the orthopaedic case load. Conclusion: COVID-19 has led to significant reductions in operating room efficiency. This will have significant impact on waiting times. Increasing frequency of regional anaesthesia concurrently with non-aerosol generating surgeries may improve efficiency.","Mercer, Scott Thomas; Agarwal, Rishi; Dayananda, Kathryn Sian Satya; Yasin, Tariq; Trickett, Ryan W",Perioper Care Oper Room Manag,32,16

(Special Issue: COVID-19.),10.896328,8.668525,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the age distribution of COVID-19 deaths and the share of deaths in nursing homes changed in the second versus the first pandemic wave. ELIGIBLE DATA: We considered all countries that had at least 4000 COVID-19 deaths occurring as of January 14, 2021, at least 200 COVID-19 deaths occurring in each of the two epidemic wave periods; and which had sufficiently detailed information available on the age distribution of these deaths. We also considered countries with data available on COVID-19 deaths of nursing home residents for the two waves. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in the second wave versus the first wave in the proportion of COVID-19 deaths occurring in people <50 years (""young deaths"") among all COVID-19 deaths and among COVID-19 deaths in people <70 years old; and change in the proportion of COVID-19 deaths in nursing home residents among all COVID-19 deaths. RESULTS: Data on age distribution were available for 14 eligible countries. Individuals <50 years old had small absolute difference in their share of the total COVID-19 deaths in the two waves across 13 high-income countries (absolute differences 0.0-0.4%). Their proportion was higher in Ukraine, but it decreased markedly in the second wave. The proportion of young deaths was lower in the second versus the first wave (summary prevalence ratio 0.81, 95% CI 0.71-0.92) with large between-country heterogeneity. The proportion of young deaths among deaths <70 years did not differ significantly across the two waves (summary prevalence ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.86-1.06). Eligible data on nursing home COVID-19 deaths were available for 11 countries. The share of COVID-19 deaths that were accounted by nursing home residents decreased in the second wave significantly and substantially in 8 countries (prevalence ratio estimates: 0.36 to 0.78), remained the same in Denmark and Norway and markedly increased in Australia. CONCLUSIONS: In the examined countries, age distribution of COVID-19 deaths has been fairly similar in the second versus the first wave, but the contribution of COVID-19 deaths in nursing home residents to total fatalities has decreased in most countries in the second wave.","Ioannidis, John P A; Axfors, Cathrine; Contopoulos-Ioannidis, Despina G",Environ Res,32,19

METHOD: We searched for clinical trial registrations of TCM in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR) on April 30, 2020. The registration quality assessment is based on the WHO Trial Registration Data Set (Version 1.3.1) and extra items for TCM information, including TCM background, theoretical origin, specific diagnosis criteria, description of intervention, and outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 136 records were examined, including 129 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) and 7 H1N1 influenza (H1N1) patients. The deficiencies in the registration of TCM clinical trials (CTs) mainly focus on a low percentage reporting detailed information about interventions (46.6%), primary outcome(s) (37.7%), and key secondary outcome(s) (18.4%) and a lack of summary result (0%). For the TCM items, none of the clinical trial registrations reported the TCM background and rationale; only 6.6% provided the TCM diagnosis criteria or a description of the TCM intervention; and 27.9% provided TCM outcome(s). CONCLUSION: Overall, although the number of registrations of TCM CTs increased, the registration quality was low. The registration quality of TCM CTs should be improved by more detailed reporting of interventions and outcomes, TCM-specific information, and sharing of the result data.","Kuang, Zhuoran; Li, Xiaoyan; Cai, Jianxiong; Chen, Yaolong; Qiu, Xiaoyuan; Ni, Xiaojia",Trials,32,1

STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study reviewing pediatric patients with SARS (n = 43) and COVID-19 (n = 244) who were admitted to the Princess Margaret Hospital in Hong Kong and Wuhan Children's Hospital in Wuhan, respectively. Demographics, hospital length of stay, and clinical and laboratory features were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 97.7% of patients with SARS and 85.2% of patients with COVID-19 had epidemiologic associations with known cases. Significantly more patients with SARS developed fever, chills, myalgia, malaise, coryza, sore throat, sputum production, nausea, headache, and dizziness than patients with COVID-19. No patients with SARS were asymptomatic at the time of admission, whereas 29.1% and 20.9% of patients with COVID-19 were asymptomatic on admission and throughout their hospital stay, respectively. More patients with SARS required oxygen supplementation than patients with COVID-19 (18.6 vs 4.7%; P = .004). Only 1.6% of patients with COVID-19 and 2.3% of patients with SARS required mechanical ventilation. Leukopenia (37.2% vs 18.6%; P = .008), lymphopenia (95.4% vs 32.6%; P < .01), and thrombocytopenia (41.9% vs 3.8%; P < .001) were significantly more common in patients with SARS than in patients with COVID-19. The duration between positive and negative nasopharyngeal aspirate and the length in hospital stay were similar in patients with COVID-19, regardless of whether they were asymptomatic or symptomatic, suggesting a similar duration of viral shedding. CONCLUSIONS: Children with COVID-19 were less symptomatic and had more favorable hematologic findings than children with SARS.","Xiong, Xiaoli; Chua, Gilbert T; Chi, Shuiqing; Kwan, Mike Yat Wah; Sang Wong, Wilfred Hing; Zhou, Aifen; Shek, Chi Chiu; Tung, Keith T S; Qin, Huan; Wong, Rosa S; Li, Xue; Chen, Peng; Li, Shuai; Chui, Celine S; Tso, Winnie W Y; Ho, Marco H K; Wong, Ian C K; Chan, Godfrey C F; Lau, Yu Lung; Wong, Kenneth K Y; Chung, Patrick H Y; Li, Hui; Tam, Paul K H; Tang, Shao-Tao; Ip, Patrick",J Pediatr,32,16

The aim of the study is to characterize the effects of a new benzofuran N-acylhydrazone compound, LASSBio-2090, on metabolic and cardiovascular alterations in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats presenting DC. Methods: Male non-diabetic lean Zucker rats (ZL) and ZDF rats treated with vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide) or LASSBio-2090 were used in this study. Metabolic parameters, cardiovascular function, left ventricle histology and inflammatory protein expression were analyzed in the experimental groups. Results: LASSBio-2090 administration in ZDF rats reduced glucose levels to 85.0 ± 1.7 mg/dL (p < 0.05). LASSBio-2090 also lowered the cholesterol and triglyceride levels from 177.8 ± 31.2 to 104.8 ± 5.3 mg/dL and from 123.0 ± 11.4 to 90.9 ± 4.8 mg/dL, respectively, in obese diabetic rats (p < 0.05). LASSBio-2090 normalized plasma insulin, insulin sensitivity and endothelial function in aortas from diabetic animals (p < 0.05). It also enhanced systolic and diastolic left-ventricular function and reverted myocardial remodeling by blocking the threefold elevation of TNF-&#945; levels in hearts from ZDF rats. Conclusion: LASSBio-2090 alleviates metabolic disturbance and cardiomyopathy in an obese and diabetic rat model, thus representing a novel strategy for the treatment of cardiovascular complications in obesity-associated type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Costa, Gizele Cabral; Montagnoli, Tadeu Lima; Da Silva, Jaqueline Soares; de Alencar, Allan Kardec Nogueira; Reina Gamba, Luis Eduardo; Alves, Bryelle Eccard Oliveira; da Silva, Marina Moraes Carvalho; Trachez, Margarete Manhães; do Nascimento, José Hamilton M; Pimentel-Coelho, Pedro Moreno; Mendez-Otero, Rosália; Lima, Lidia Moreira; Barreiro, Eliezer J; Sudo, Roberto Takashi; Zapata-Sudo, Gisele",Drug Des Devel Ther,32,1

Accurately identifying patients at an increased risk of deterioration may help hospitals manage their resources while improving the quality of patient care. Here we present the results of an analytical model, PICTURE (Predicting Intensive Care Transfers and Other UnfoReseen Events), to identify patients at a high risk for imminent intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, respiratory failure, or death with the intention to improve prediction of deterioration due to COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To validate the PICTURE model's ability to predict unexpected deterioration in general ward and COVID-19 patients, and to compare its performance with the Epic Deterioration Index (EDI), an existing model which has recently been assessed for use in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The PICTURE model was trained and validated on a cohort of hospitalized non-COVID-19 patients using electronic health record data from 2014-2018. It was then applied to two hold-out test sets: non-COVID-19 patients from 2019 and patients testing positive for COVID-19 in 2020. PICTURE results were aligned to EDI and NEWS scores for head-to-head comparison via Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve (AUROC) and Area Under the Precision Recall Curve (AUPRC). We compared the models' ability to predict an adverse event (defined as ICU transfer, mechanical ventilation use, or death). Shapley values were used to provide explanations for PICTURE predictions. RESULTS: In non-COVID-19 general ward patients, PICTURE achieved an AUROC (95% CI) of 0.819 (0.805 - 0.834) per observation, compared to the EDI's 0.763 (0.746 - 0.781) (n = 21,740, P < 0.001). In patients testing positive for COVID-19, PICTURE again outperformed the EDI with an AUROC (95% CI) of 0.849 (0.820 - 0.878) compared to the EDI's 0.803 (0.772 - 0.838) (n = 607, P < 0.001). The most important variables influencing PICTURE predictions in the COVID-19 cohort were a rapid respiratory rate, a high level of oxygen support, low oxygen saturation, and impaired mental status (Glasgow coma score). CONCLUSIONS: The PICTURE model is more accurate in predicting adverse patient outcomes for both general ward patients and COVID-19 positive patients in our cohorts compared to the EDI. The ability to consistently anticipate these events may be especially valuable when considering potential incipient waves of COVID-19 infections. The generalizability of the model will require testing in other health care systems for validation.","Cummings, Brandon C; Ansari, Sardar; Motyka, Jonathan R; Wang, Guan; Medlin, Richard P; Kronick, Steven L; Singh, Karandeep; Park, Pauline K; Napolitano, Lena M; Dickson, Robert P; Mathis, Michael R; Sjoding, Michael W; Admon, Andrew J; Blank, Ross; McSparron, Jakob I; Ward, Kevin R; Gillies, Christopher E",,32,20

Decisions surrounding surveillance design parameters-such as the number and placement of surveillance sites, target populations, and case definitions-are often determined by expert opinion or deference to operational considerations, without formal analysis of the influence of design parameters on surveillance objectives. Here we propose a simulation framework to guide evidence-based surveillance network design to better achieve specific surveillance goals with limited resources. We define evidence-based surveillance design as an optimization problem, acknowledging the many operational constraints under which surveillance systems operate, the many dimensions of surveillance system design, the multiple and competing goals of surveillance, and the complex and dynamic nature of disease systems. We describe an analytical framework-the Disease Surveillance Informatics Optimization and Simulation (DIOS) framework-for the identification of optimal surveillance designs through mathematical representations of disease and surveillance processes, definition of objective functions, and numerical optimization. We then apply the framework to the problem of selecting candidate sites to expand an existing surveillance network under alternative objectives of: (1) improving spatial prediction of disease prevalence at unmonitored sites; or (2) estimating the observed effect of a risk factor on disease. Results of this demonstration illustrate how optimal designs are sensitive to both surveillance goals and the underlying spatial pattern of the target disease. The findings affirm the value of designing surveillance systems through quantitative and adaptive analysis of network characteristics and performance. The framework can be applied to the design of surveillance systems tailored to setting-specific disease transmission dynamics and surveillance needs, and can yield improved understanding of tradeoffs between network architectures.","Cheng, Qu; Collender, Philip A; Heaney, Alexandra K; Li, Xintong; Dasan, Rohini; Li, Charles; Lewnard, Joseph A; Zelner, Jonathan L; Liang, Song; Chang, Howard H; Waller, Lance A; Lopman, Benjamin A; Yang, Changhong; Remais, Justin V",PLoS Comput Biol,32,2

The second part involves the items related to precautionary measures using none, sometimes, and always. The last part contains items related to death probability owing to other causes and this includes five categories: extremely low, low, intermediate, high and extremely high. The validity and reliability of this questionnaire were revised by the panel of experts before the data collection. Results: The outcomes of the study revealed that the majority, ca. 73%, of the Kurdistan Region/Iraq population depended on TV to obtain information about COVID-19. Also, this investigation showed that there is a substantial association between participants with infection prevention and control practices relevant to COVID-19. Moreover, according to this study, there is a significant relationship between the death probability and COVID-19. Concurrently, there is not any significant association between other causes, namely cancer, heart diseases, diabetes and road traffic accidents, and the death probability. Conclusion: This study showed that for the majority of the Kurdistan Region/Iraq population the most reliable source of information for any COVID-19 related updates is the TV broadcast. This study also indicated that there is strong association for the majority of individuals regarding their practices for prevention from COVID-19 and death probability with COVID-19. However, there is not any substantial association between the epidemic and the other deadly calamities and the death probability.","Barzinjy, Azeez A; Aziz, Kareem F; Hussen, Bashdar M; Qader, Saleem S; Hamad, Samir M; Qader, Arez S; Jamal, Abdullah L",Z Gesundh Wiss,32,26

In addition to the importance of patient disclosure, there is significant legal pressure to avoid missed diagnoses. We reported previously 63.5% of IF were disclosed prior to discharge, with 20% non-disclosed. We initiated a multi-disciplinary systemic plan to effect pre-discharge disclosure by synoptic CT reports with American College of Radiology (ACR) recommended follow-up, EMR discharge prompts, and provider education. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational series patients from November 2019-February 2020. Statistical analysis performed with SPSS statistical package web version 21. RESULTS: 877 patients (pts) with CT (507 males/370 females) Average age was 57 years (range: 14-99) and 96% had blunt injury. In 315 pts there were 523 IF (1.7 per pt.), the most common being lung (17.5%), kidney (13%) and liver (11%). Radiology report compliance was 210 of 249 (84%). There were 66 studies from outside facilities. Sixteen IF were suspicious for malignancy. A total of 151 pts needed no follow-up and 148 pts needed future follow-up evaluation. Pre-discharge IF disclosure compliance was 90.1% (286 patients), with 25 post-discharge. Four pts remain undisclosed. Compared to our previous report, clearer reporting and EMR prompts increased pre-discharge disclosure from 63.5% to 90.1% (p < 0.01, Chi-square test) and decreased days to notification from 29.5 (0-277) to 5.2 (range 0-59) (p < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test.) CONCLUSION: Timely, complete disclosure of IF improves patient outcome and reduces medicolegal risk. Collaboration between trauma, radiology, and IT promotes improved disclosure in trauma populations.","Smith, Lou M; King, Sarah A; Shealy, Jordan A; Heidel, Robert E; Morin-Ducote, Garnetta I; Husband, Leland D; Callison, John C; Rosen, Brenton A; Savoy, Rachel A; Daley, Brian J",J.

While telemedicine is rapidly evolving in the fields of teleconsultation and telesurgery, proper telediagnostic systems are not yet available, although the demand for contactless patient-doctor interaction is increasing. METHODS: In this project, the current limitations were addressed by developing a comprehensive telediagnostic system. Therefore, medical examinations have been assessed in collaboration with medical experts. Subsequently, a framework was developed, satisfying the relevant constraints of medical-, technical-, and hygienic- aspects in order to transform in-person examinations into a contactless procedure. Diagnostic steps were classified into three groups: assisted procedures carried out by the patient, teleoperated examination methods, and adoptions of conventional methods. RESULTS: The Telemedical Diagnostic Framework was implemented, resulting in a functional proof of concept, where potentially infectious patients could undergo a full medical examination. The system comprises, e.g., a naso-pharyngeal swab, an inspection of the oral cavity, auscultation, percussion, and palpation, based on robotic end-effectors. The physician is thereby connected using a newly developed user-interface and a lead robot, with force feedback control, that enables precise movements with the follower robot on the patient's side. CONCLUSION: Our concept proves the feasibility of a fully telediagnostic system, that consolidates available technology and new developments to an efficient solution enabling safe patient-doctor interaction. Besides infectious situations, this solution can also be applied to remote areas.","Fuchtmann, Jonas; Krumpholz, Roman; Berlet, Maximilian; Ostler, Daniel; Feussner, Hubertus; Haddadin, Sami; Wilhelm, Dirk",Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg,32,26

Studies of suicide repetition are important for suicide prevention. This study examined the clinical characteristics and psychiatric comorbidities of pesticide self-harm as associated with suicide attempt repetition status. Patients and Methods: This retrospective, observational study included patients admitted to a medical center in northern Taiwan between 2000 and 2015 following suicide attempts by pesticide. Diagnoses were made by a consultation-liaison psychiatry team based on the DSM IV-TR criteria. Independent samples t-test was used to analyze the quantitative variables and Pearson's Chi-squared test with a Bonferroni adjustment for categorical variables. Univariate binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the predictors for repeated suicide attempt and multivariate binary logistic regression analysis to identify significant associated factors. Results: Among 151 patients, organophosphate pesticides were the most used (80.8%). The average age was 52.9±17.2 years. Most patients were married males from rural areas, with depressive disorder most often diagnosed (40.4%). Nearly one-third of them were suicide repeaters (n=43, 28.5%); these patients were less likely to be married (53.5%, p=0.001), had previously used psychiatric services (72.1%, p<0.001) and chose complex suicide (46.5%, p=0.014) more often compared to nonrepeaters. No significant differences were found between repeaters and nonrepeaters regarding psychiatric comorbidities. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that marital status (odds ratio: 2.916, 95% confidence interval: 1.234-6.891, p=0.015) and previous psychiatric services usage (odds ratio: 6.897, 95% confidence interval: 3.012-15.625, p<0.001) were significant risk factors associated with suicide repetition. Conclusion: Pesticide suicide repeaters were characterized by less likely to be married and more likely to use psychiatric services before suicide attempts. These features help ensuring that the needs of people who have made a suicide attempt are addressed, and it reduces the likelihood of repetition.","Huang, Wei-Chen; Yen, Tzung-Hai; Lin, Long; Lin, Chemin; Juang, Yeong-Yuh; Wang, Bi-Hwa; Lee, Shwu-Hua",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,32,24

A new federal effort to strengthen and coordinate nutrition research could rapidly generate the evidence base needed to address these multiple national challenges. However, the relevant characteristics of such an effort have been uncertain. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to provide an objective, informative summary of 1) the mounting diet-related health burdens facing our nation and corresponding economic, health equity, national security, and sustainability implications; 2) the current federal nutrition research landscape and existing mechanisms for its coordination; 3) the opportunities for and potential impact of new fundamental, clinical, public health, food and agricultural, and translational scientific discoveries; and 4) the various options for further strengthening and coordinating federal nutrition research, including corresponding advantages, disadvantages, and potential executive and legislative considerations. METHODS: We reviewed government and other published documents on federal nutrition research; held various discussions with expert groups, advocacy organizations, and scientific societies; and held in-person or phone meetings with >50 federal staff in executive and legislative roles, as well as with a variety of other stakeholders in academic, industry, and nongovernment organizations. RESULTS: Stark national nutrition challenges were identified. More Americans are sick than are healthy, largely from rising diet-related illnesses. These conditions create tremendous strains on productivity, health care costs, health disparities, government budgets, US economic competitiveness, and military readiness. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has further laid bare these strains, including food insecurity, major diet-related comorbidities for poor outcomes from COVID-19 such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, and insufficient surveillance on and coordination of our food system. More than 10 federal departments and agencies currently invest in critical nutrition research, yet with relatively flat investments over several decades. Coordination also remains suboptimal, documented by multiple governmental reports over 50 years. Greater harmonization and expansion of federal investment in nutrition science, not a silo-ing or rearrangement of existing investments, has tremendous potential to generate new discoveries to improve and sustain the health of all Americans. Two identified key strategies to achieve this were as follows: 1) a new authority for robust cross-governmental coordination of nutrition research and other nutrition-related policy and 2) strengthened authority, investment, and coordination for nutrition research within the NIH. These strategies were found to be complementary, together catalyzing important new science, partnerships, coordination, and returns on investment. Additional complementary actions to accelerate federal nutrition research were identified at the USDA. CONCLUSIONS: The need and opportunities for strengthened federal nutrition research are clear, with specific identified options to help create the new leadership, strategic planning, coordination, and investment the nation requires to address the multiple nutrition-related challenges and grasp the opportunities before us.","Fleischhacker, Sheila E; Woteki, Catherine E; Coates, Paul M; Hubbard, Van S; Flaherty, Grace E; Glickman, Daniel R; Harkin, Thomas R; Kessler, David; Li, William W; Loscalzo, Joseph; Parekh, Anand; Rowe, Sylvia; Stover, Patrick J; Tagtow, Angie; Yun, Anthony Joon; Mozaffarian, Dariush",Am J Clin Nutr,32,20

Here, we analyzed >41 000 genomes (including >26 000 high-quality (HQ) genomes) downloaded from the GISAID repository, including 1 245 (922 HQ) sampled in Spain. The aim of this study was to investigate genome variation of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and reconstruct phylogeographic and transmission patterns in Spain. Phylogeographic analysis suggested at least 34 independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 to Spain at the beginning of the outbreak. Six lineages spread very successfully in the country, probably favored by super-spreaders, namely, A2a4 (7.8%), A2a5 (38.4%), A2a10 (2.8%), B3a (30.1%), and B9 (8.7%), which accounted for 87.9% of all genomes in the Spanish database. One distinct feature of the Spanish SARS-CoV-2 genomes was the higher frequency of B lineages (39.3%, mainly B3a+B9) than found in any other European country. While B3a, B9, (and an important sub-lineage of A2a5, namely, A2a5c) most likely originated in Spain, the other three haplogroups were imported from other European locations. The B3a strain may have originated in the Basque Country from a B3 ancestor of uncertain geographic origin, whereas B9 likely emerged in Madrid. The time of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that the first coronavirus entered the country around 11 February 2020, as estimated from the TMRCA of B3a, the first lineage detected in the country. Moreover, earlier claims that the D614G mutation is associated to higher transmissibility is not consistent with the very high prevalence of COVID-19 in Spain when compared to other countries with lower disease incidence but much higher frequency of this mutation (56.4% in Spain vs. 82.4% in rest of Europe). Instead, the data support a major role of genetic drift in modeling the micro-geographic stratification of virus strains across the country as well as the role of SARS-CoV-2 super-spreaders.","Gómez-Carballa, Alberto; Bello, Xabier; Pardo-Seco, Jacobo; Pérez Del Molino, María Luisa; Martinón-Torres, Federico; Salas, Antonio",Zool Res,32,16

RESULTS: All patients confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia had bilateral GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions without airway abnormalities, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion. The five CT criteria showed moderate to excellent diagnostic performance with area under the curves (AUCs) ranging 0.77-0.88 for R1 and 0.78-0.92 for R2. The criterion (e) showed the highest AUC. CONCLUSION: Chest CT would play a supplemental role to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from other respiratory diseases presenting with similar symptoms in a clinical setting.","Himoto, Yuki; Sakata, Akihiko; Kirita, Mitsuhiro; Hiroi, Takashi; Kobayashi, Ken-Ichiro; Kubo, Kenji; Kim, Hyunjin; Nishimoto, Azusa; Maeda, Chikara; Kawamura, Akira; Komiya, Nobuhiro; Umeoka, Shigeaki",Jpn J Radiol,32,20

Objective: To assess the association of perceived work-life conflict with academic medicine faculty intention to leave, reducing employment to part time, or declining leadership opportunities before and since the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Settings, and Participants: An anonymous online survey of medical, graduate, and health professions school faculty was conducted at a single large, urban academic medical center between September 1 and September 25, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-assessed intention to leave, reducing employment to part time, or turning down leadership opportunities because of work-life conflict before and since the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Of the 1186 of 3088 (38%) of faculty members who answered the survey, 649 (55%) were women and 682 (58%) were White individuals. Respondents were representative of the overall faculty demographic characteristics except for an overrepresentation of female faculty respondents and underrepresentation of Asian faculty respondents compared with all faculty (female faculty: 649 [55%] vs 1368 [44%]; Asian faculty: 259 [22%] vs 963 [31%]). After the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, faculty were more likely to consider leaving or reducing employment to part time compared with before the pandemic (leaving: 225 [23%] vs 133 [14%]; P < .001; reduce hours: 281 [29%] vs 206 [22%]; P < .001). Women were more likely than men to reduce employment to part time before the COVID-19 pandemic (153 [28%] vs 44 [12%]; P < .001) and to consider both leaving or reducing employment to part time since the COVID-19 pandemic (leaving: 154 [28%] vs 56 [15%]; P < .001; reduce employment: 215 [40%] vs 49 [13%]; P < .001). Faculty with children were more likely to consider leaving and reducing employment since the COVID-19 pandemic compared with before the pandemic (leaving: 159 [29%] vs 93 [17%]; P < .001; reduce employment: 213 [40%] vs 130 [24%]; P < .001). Women with children compared with women without children were also more likely to consider leaving since the COVID-19 pandemic than before (113 [35%] vs 39 [17%]; P < .001). Working parent faculty and women were more likely to decline leadership opportunities both before (faculty with children vs without children: 297 [32%] vs 84 [9%]; P < .001; women vs men: 206 [29%] vs 47 [13%]; P < .001) and since the COVID-19 pandemic (faculty with children vs faculty without children: 316 [34%] vs 93 [10 %]; P < .001; women vs men: 148 [28%] vs 51 [14%]; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study, the perceived stressors associated with work-life integration were higher in women than men, were highest in women with children, and have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The association of both gender and parenting with increased perceived work-life stress may disproportionately decrease the long-term retention and promotion of junior and midcareer women faculty.","Matulevicius, Susan A; Kho, Kimberly A; Reisch, Joan; Yin, Helen",JAMA Netw Open,32,16

The calves were all born on-farm, transferred to pens soon after birth, and fed with ""gold"" colostrum. The hygiene, biosecurity and ventilation in the pens were poor. Of the 15 calves, 11 died or were euthanised and four calves, &#8804;48-hour-old, that became acutely ill later in the outbreak were treated with cefquinome, a fourth-generation cephalosporin, and recovered. Clinical findings: The affected calves presented with acute recumbency, lethargy, tachypnoea, tachycardia, increased lung sounds, inability to stand or feed, and dehydration without pyrexia. Pathological findings: Gross findings in a calf that died naturally included fibrinous pleuropneumonia, marked oedematous expansion of the interlobular septa, especially in the ventral lung lobes, fibrinous polyserositis and fibrinous polyarthritis. A second calf that was euthanised had strikingly similar lung lesions. Histologically, the pulmonary interlobular septa of both calves were prominently expanded by oedema, dilated lymphatics and the infiltration of numerous neutrophils and macrophages interspersed with small Gram-negative rod bacteria. Likewise, the visceral pleura showed fibrinopurulent inflammation with numerous small Gram-negative rods. Microbiological findings: Microbial culture and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry identified Bibersteinia trehalosi in the lung, stifle joint and peritoneal cavity of the first calf and lung of the second. Diagnosis: B. trehalosi acute fibrinous pleuropneumonia and septicaemia. Clinical relevance: This is the first report of the clinical findings and histological lesions of B. trehalosi pleuropneumonia and septicaemia in calves in New Zealand. The pathogen is isolated with increasing frequency from cases of bovine respiratory disease in dairy cows, feedlot cattle and calves in the United Kingdom and North America. The importance of microbial culture in cases such as this with unusual lung lesions in calves <48 hours of age, cannot be over emphasised. Cefquinome was administered to all remaining heifer calves and four calves that became ill later in the outbreak recovered after cefquinome treatment.","Brown, S E; Bycroft, K A; Adam, K; Collett, M G",N Z Vet J,32,17

Here we summarise biocatalytic methods that have been applied to the production of FDA-approved anti-viral drugs and their intermediates. Exemplary are the enzymatic asymmetric synthesis of amino acid components, the fermentative production of structurally complex intermediates of anti-influenza drugs and the fully enzymatic, large-scale synthesis of a potential block-buster HIV drug. With many enzyme classes being uncharted with regards to the synthesis of anti-viral agents, there is still a large unopened toolbox waiting to be unlocked.

It is now proved that it can affect different body organs which necessitate intensive care management. Ozone (O3) therapy was used before for treating various viral infections like hepatitis B, human immune deficiency virus (HIV), and Ebola viruses. O3 also can manage hypoxia and increase tissue oxygenation, besides its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties which may have an important role in the management of cytokine storm. We used rectal O3 insufflation therapy assuming that it may have a beneficial role in the management of COVID-19 disease. Two sessions of rectal O3 therapy were given to a 60-year-old female patient who was confirmed COVID-19 positive. Before applying O3 therapy, she was hypoxic (sPO2:90%) despite mechanical ventilation with high fraction inspired oxygen (FiO2:90%). After therapy, she was markedly improved and discharged to the inpatient ward and then discharged home on day 10 post-admission. Another 40-year-old male patient who was confirmed COVID-19 positive and was home isolated received one session of O3 therapy. Before therapy, he was hypoxic (sPO2:85% on room air and 95% with O2 face mask 5 L/min). The patient showed gradual improvement over the next 3 days after therapy and becomes oxygen-independent (sPO2 became 94-97% on room air). No adverse effects were noticed in both cases.

Asymptomatic spread of COVID-19 from nursing facility staff and residents is a major accelerator of infection. Facility-wide point-prevalence testing is an emerging strategy in disease mitigation. Because time is not available to await the results of randomized controlled trials before implementing strategies in this high-risk setting, an expert Delphi panel composed of experienced long-term care medicine professionals has now met to provide testing guidance for SARS-Coronavirus-2 to NFs. After many email and telephone discussions, the panel responded to a questionnaire that included six different scenarios, based on varying availability of Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing and personal protective equipment (PPE). The panel endorsed facility-wide testing of staff and residents without dissent when diagnostic RT-PCR was available. While the panel recognized the limitations of RT-PCR testing, it strongly recommended this testing for both staff and residents in NFs that were either COVID-19 naive or had limited outbreaks. There was also consensus on testing residents with atypical symptoms in a scenario of limited testing capability. The panel favored testing every 1 to 2 weeks if testing was readily available, reducing the frequency to every month as community prevalence declined or as the collection of additional data further informed clinical critical thinking and decision-making. The panel recognized that frequent testing would have consequences in terms of potential staff shortages due to quarantine after positive tests and increased PPE use. However, the panel felt that not testing would allow new clusters of infection to form. The resulting high mortality rate would outweigh the potential negative consequences of testing. The panel also recognized the pandemic as a rapidly evolving crisis, and that new science and increasing experience might require an updating of its recommendations. The panel hopes that its recommendations will be of value to the long-term care industry and to policy makers as we work together to manage through this challenging and stressful time.","Wasserman, M; Ouslander, J G; Lam, A; Wolk, A G; Morley, J E; von Preyss-Friedman, S; Marco, N; Nazir, A; Haimowitz, D; Bessey, F",J Nutr Health Aging,32,19

This study was conducted on MERS lab confirmed cases reported to Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia and WHO for year 2012-2019. The epidemiology was investigated based on infection rate, death rate, case fatality rate, Gender, Age group, and Medical conditions (Comorbid and Symptomatic). The overall median age of infected male was 58â¯years and of female was 45â¯years. While average mortality age in male was 60â¯years and of female was 65â¯years which is greater than the global average of 50â¯years. The results also report that specially after age of 40â¯years in both men and women, chances of infection are more while comorbidities increase the infection rate. The men are more susceptible to infection than women. In case of asymptomatic distribution trend was vice versa with 69.4% women and 30.6% in men. Second, most infected age group was reduced by 20â¯years in case of men with 47.37% infection for age group of 20-39â¯years. This was also observed in age-group of 20-39â¯years for no comorbid cases (men (50%) & women (79%)). This explains MERS-CoV prevalence in Saudi Arabia, as young and healthy population were infected, and acted as carrier and on coming in contact with vulnerable population (Elderly, chronic and comorbid) transferred the infection. Hence, MERS-CoV outbreak kept on happening from time to time over past years. This finding might very well explain the exponential spread of Novel CoV-19 globally, as initial control measures required older people to stay indoors while younger generation brought infection from outside. Further studies are required for epidemiology analysis based on clusters, travel history and specific disease related mortality.","Khan, Saman; El Morabet, Rachida; Khan, Roohul Abad; Bindajam, Ahmad; Alqadhi, Saeed; Alsubih, Majed; Khan, Nadeem Ahmad",Sci Total Environ,32,31

Influenza-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe COVID-19 patients are both at risk of developing invasive fungal diseases. We used the new international definitions of influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) and COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) to compare the demographic, clinical, biological, and radiological aspects of IAPA and CAPA in a monocentric retrospective study. A total of 120 patients were included, 71 with influenza and 49 with COVID-19-associated ARDS. Among them, 27 fulfilled the newly published criteria of IPA: 17/71 IAPA (23.9%) and 10/49 CAPA (20.4%). Kaplan–Meier curves showed significantly higher 90-day mortality for IPA patients overall (p = 0.032), whereas mortality did not differ between CAPA and IAPA patients. Radiological findings showed differences between IAPA and CAPA, with a higher proportion of features suggestive of IPA during IAPA. Lastly, a wide proportion of IPA patients had low plasma voriconazole concentrations with a higher delay to reach concentrations &gt;2 mg/L in CAPA vs. IAPA patients (p = 0.045). Severe COVID-19 and influenza patients appeared very similar in terms of prevalence of IPA and outcome. The dramatic consequences on the patients’ prognosis emphasize the need for a better awareness in these particular populations.","Reizine, Florian Pinceaux Kieran Lederlin Mathieu Autier Brice Guegan Hélène Gacouin Arnaud Luque-Paz David Boglione-Kerrien Christelle Bacle Astrid Le Daré Brendan Launey Yoann Lesouhaitier Mathieu Painvin Benoit Camus Christophe Mansour Alexandre Robert-Gangneux Florence Belaz Sorya Le Tulzo Yves Tadié Jean-Marc Maamar Adel Gangneux Jean-Pierre",Journal of Fungi,32,5

Methods: The present study was a rapid review of all international databases, including PubMed (Medline), Scopus, Web of Sciences, Embase, and Cochrane Library from January 1 to October 30, 2020. Results: In this review, 7 scenarios were considered for COVID-19 iceberg, in which the range of fatality percentage was estimated to be 0.5% to 7%, the range of asymptomatic cases 1% to 88.6%, the range of cases with mild symptoms 8% to 78%, no symptoms 1 % to 90 %, the range of intensive care unit (ICU) admission was 0.5% to 14.2%, and finally the intubation percentage was estimated to be 0.2% to 12.2%. The Scenarios Diamond Princess Cruise Ship and Iceland are closer to the reality of the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 around the world, which represent 0.6% and 0.5% of deaths, 0.7% and 1% of intubations, 2.5% and 9.7% of ICU admissions, 1.1% and 6% of hospitalizations, 15% and 31% of cases with mild symptoms, and finally 56.9% and 75% of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19, respectively, which should now be considered as the basis of the clinical knowledge of the disease. Conclusion: Understanding the clinical spectrum and natural knowledge of the disease and paying attention to asymptomatic or mild-symptom cases can help to make better decisions and develop more effective interventions to control COVID-19. © 2021 Iran University of Medical Sciences.

First, we consider a single population modified SIR epidemics model in which the contact rate is allowed to be an arbitrary function of the fraction of susceptible and infected individuals. This allows one to model either the reaction of individuals to the information about the spread of the disease or the result of government restriction measures, imposed to limit social interactions and contain contagion. We study the effect of both smooth dependancies of the contact rate for which we prove the existence of a threshold phenomenon that generalizes the well-known dichotomy associated to the reproduction rate parameter in the classical SIR model, and discontinuous feedback terms, which can be studied using tools from sliding mode control. Finally, we consider network SIR models involving different subpopulations that interact on a contact graph and present some preliminary results on the existence of novel dynamical behaviors such as the emergence of multi-modal(doubly-peaked) trajectories for the fraction of infected population.","Alutto, Martina; Como, Giacomo; Fagnani, Fabio",,32,1

Our principal contribution is to show why, and how, age-at-death data should be used to construct the age-standardised statistics necessary to make meaningful comparisons of mortality rates across time and space. We conclude that studies of the economic consequences of pandemics must better control for demographic factors if they are to yield useful policy-relevant insights.

The potential for disasters to act as ""focusing events"" for policy change, including adaptation to climate change risk, is well known. Moreover, local action is an important element of climate change adaptation and related risk management efforts. As such, there is a good reason to expect local communities to mobilize in response to disaster events, both with immediate response and recovery-focused activities, as well as longer-term preparedness and adaptation-focused public policy changes. However, scholars also note that the experience of disaster does not always yield policy change; indeed, disasters can also result in policy inertia and failure, perhaps as often or more often than major policy change. This study poses two key research questions. First, we ask to what degree policy change occurs in communities impacted by an extreme weather event. Second, we seek to understand the conditions that lead to adaptation-oriented policy adoption in response to an extreme weather event. Our results suggest two main recipes for future-oriented policy adoption in the wake of an extreme weather event. For both recipes, a high-impact event is a necessary condition for future-oriented policy adoption. In the first recipe for change, policy adoption occurs in Democratic communities with highly focused media attention. The second, less expected recipe for change involves Republican communities that have experienced other uncommon weather events in the recent past. We use a comparative case approach with 15 cases and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis methods. Our approach adds to the existing literature on policy change and local adaptation by selecting a mid-N range of cases where extreme weather events have the potential to act as focusing events, thereby sidestepping selection on the dependent variable. Our approach also takes advantage of a novel method for measuring attention, the latent Dirichlet allocation approach.","Giordono, Leanne; Boudet, Hilary; Gard-Murray, Alexander",Policy Sci,32,20

The method is based on a state-space lumping scheme that aggregates states in a grid structure. The resulting approximate bridging distribution is used to iteratively refine relevant and truncate irrelevant parts of the state-space. This way the algorithm learns a well-justified finite-state projection yielding guaranteed lower bounds for the system behavior under endpoint constraints.

Here, we review the difficulties of inferring reliable phylogenies by example of a data snapshot comprising a quality-filtered subset of 8, 736 out of all 16, 453 virus sequences available on May 5, 2020 from gisaid.org. We find that it is difficult to infer a reliable phylogeny on these data due to the large number of sequences in conjunction with the low number of mutations. We further find that rooting the inferred phylogeny with some degree of confidence either via the bat and pangolin outgroups or by applying novel computational methods on the ingroup phylogeny does not appear to be credible. Finally, an automatic classification of the current sequences into sub-classes using the mPTP tool for molecular species delimitation is also, as might be expected, not possible, as the sequences are too closely related. We conclude that, although the application of phylogenetic methods to disentangle the evolution and spread of COVID-19 provides some insight, results of phylogenetic analyses, in particular those conducted under the default settings of current phylogenetic inference tools, as well as downstream analyses on the inferred phylogenies, should be considered and interpreted with extreme caution.","Morel, Benoit; Barbera, Pierre; Czech, Lucas; Bettisworth, Ben; Hübner, Lukas; Lutteropp, Sarah; Serdari, Dora; Kostaki, Evangelia-Georgia; Mamais, Ioannis; Kozlov, Alexey M; Pavlidis, Pavlos; Paraskevis, Dimitrios; Stamatakis, Alexandros",Mol. biol. evol,32,16

However, little is known about the relation between specific HIV-related factors and the severity of the COVID-19 disease. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of cases collected through an on-line survey distributed by the Euroguidelines in Central and Eastern Europe Network Group. In statistical analyses characteristics of HIV-positive patients, asymptomatic/moderate and moderate/severe course were compared. RESULTS: In total 34 HIV-positive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were reported by 12 countries (Estonia, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Albania, Belarus, Romania, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Poland, Russia, Hungary, Bulgaria). Asymptomatic courses of COVID-19 were reported in four (12%) cases, 11 (32%) patients presented with mild disease not requiring hospitalization, moderate disease with respiratory and/or systemic symptoms was observed in 14 (41%) cases, and severe disease with respiratory failure was found in five (15%) patients. The HIV-related characteristics of patients with an asymptomatic/mild course of COVID-19 were comparable to those with a moderate/severe course of COVID-19, except for the use of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) in cART regimen (0.0% vs. 31.6% respectively, p = 0.0239). CONCLUSIONS: In our analyses HIV viral suppression and immunological status were not associated with the course of COVID-19 disease.

Covid-19 required the urgency of a new psychological intervention model to better address the crisis and ensure a direct support response to the people involved in the pandemic. The present study aimed to detect the symptoms and reactions of the population with respect to the event. The survey was carried out by describing the clinical symptoms that emerged from the triage card used by SIPEM SoS Emilia Romagna (Italy), connoting the criteria of emergency psychology. METHODS: A retrospective quantitative study was conducted on 288 psychological triage cards. RESULTS: only 11% of users who ask for support say they are positive while 85% report not having contracted the virus. Of the total, 40.9% call for psychological support in the management of anxiety symptoms, a need also reported by 55% of the subsample who declared previous psychological problems. In reaction to the pandemic event, 51.1% of the total refers to coping resources and availability for help. DISCUSSIONS: the need for support of the population to manage symptoms highlights the need for early interventions, also to facilitate that slice of the population that does not have effective individual coping strategies and resources available to help. CONCLUSIONS: it can be deduced that interventions during these types of emergencies must be timely and aimed not only at those affected but also at the general population.","Cervellione, Brenda; Rossi, Sandra; Carbone, Roberta; Ferracane, Giuseppina; Lombardo, Ester M C; Pedrelli, Enrica; Sozzi, Anna; Artioli, Giovanna; Sarli, Leopoldo; Iacolino, Calogero",Acta Biomed,32,26

Among coronaviruses, the main protease (Mpro) is an essential drug target which, along with papain-like proteases catalyzes the processing of polyproteins translated from viral RNA and recognizes specific cleavage sites. There are no human proteases with similar cleavage specificity and therefore, inhibitors are highly likely to be nontoxic. Therefore, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme with small molecules can block viral replication. The present study is aimed at the identification of promising lead molecules for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme through virtual screening of antiviral compounds from plants. The binding affinity of selected small drug-like molecules to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro were studied using molecular docking. Bonducellpin D was identified as the best lead molecule which shows higher binding affinity (-9.28 kcal/mol) as compared to the control (-8.24 kcal/mol). The molecular binding was stabilized through four hydrogen bonds with Glu166 and Thr190 as well as hydrophobic interactions via eight residues. The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro shows identities of 96.08% and 50.65% to that of SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro respectively at the sequence level. At the structural level, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and SARS-CoV Mpro was found to be 0.517 Å and 0.817 Å between SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro. Bonducellpin D exhibited broad-spectrum inhibition potential against SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro and therefore is a promising drug candidate, which needs further validations through in vitro and in vivo studies.","Gurung, Arun Bahadur; Ali, Mohammad Ajmal; Lee, Joongku; Farah, Mohammad Abul; Al-Anazi, Khalid Mashay",Life Sci,32,21

The present study reports for the first time the levels of 7 polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners, and 18 trace elements measured in dust samples collected in 68 households from Zagreb, Croatia. Based on the obtained data from dust analysis and the questionnaire on the house characteristics and habits of the residents, we aimed to assess the possible indoor sources of PBDEs/elements, and the associated health risks. Mass concentrations of &#931;PBDE ranged from 0.16 and 200.09 ng g-1 dust (median 4.19 ng g-1 dust). The most frequently detected congeners were BDE-99 and BDE-183 found in >88% of samples, while for trace elements, Al, Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu were found at the highest concentrations (enumerated in the descending order). The regression analysis indicated that renovation, number of residents and hours spent using electronic devices are significant predictors for determining PBDE dust concentrations, while the house age, and the house area were identified as the most important contributors for most trace elements. Our health risk assessment considering dust ingestion and dermal absorption of analyzed dust indicated that no adverse health effects are expected in toddlers and adults from exposure to PBDEs or trace elements in house dust. However, calculating the worst case exposure scenario based on the maximum measured concentrations and high dust intake rates, it was estimated that there is a risk of potential adverse health effects for Co (HI > 1). Even though the cases of high exposure to toxic elements from dust are sporadic, and not common among the general population, this exposure scenario should be included whenever assessing the background exposure of children.","Klincic, Darija; Tariba Lovakovic, Blanka; Jagic, Karla; Dvorscak, Marija",Sci Total Environ,32,11

These symptoms are even more common in patients who required intensive care for severe effects of the virus. In addition to the pandemic-related psychological stress, multiple biological mechanisms have been proposed to understand the neuropsychiatric symptoms observed with COVID-19. Given limited research regarding effective interventions, we recommend pharmacologic and behavioral strategies with established evidence in other medically-ill populations. Long-term, neuropsychiatric complications of COVID-19 are common and consequential. Because these are likely to co-occur with other medical problems, patients recovering from COVID-19 are best managed in clinics with highly coordinated care across disciplines and medical specialties.

Availability of X-ray structures of SARS-CoV2 main protease (Mpro) provides the potential opportunity for structure-based drug designing. Here, we have made an attempt to do computational drug design by targeting main protease of SARS-CoV2. High-throughput virtual screening of million molecules and natural compounds databases were performed followed by docking. After that, the protein-ligand complexes were optimized and rescoring of binding energies were accomplished through molecular dynamics simulation and Molecular mechanics Poisson Boltzmann surface area approaches, respectively. In addition, conformational effect of various ligands on protein was also examined through essential dynamics simulation. Three compounds namely ZINC14732869, ZINC19774413, and ZINC19774479 were finally filtered that displayed better binding affinities than N3 (known) inhibitor and formed conformationally stable complexes.

The virus can cause acute respiratory syndrome, which can be lethal, and is easily transmitted between hosts. Most states have issued state-at-home executive orders, however, parks and other public open spaces have largely remained open and are seeing sharp increases in public use. Therefore, in order to ensure public safety, it is imperative for patrons of public open spaces to practice safe hygiene and take preventative measures. This work provides a scalable sensing approach to detect physical activities within public open spaces and monitor adherence to social distancing guidelines suggested by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A deep learning-based computer vision sensing framework is designed to investigate the careful and proper utilization of parks and park facilities with hard surfaces (e.g. benches, fence poles, and trash cans) using video feeds from a pre-installed surveillance camera network. The sensing framework consists of a CNN-based object detector, a multi-target tracker, a mapping module, and a group reasoning module. The experiments are carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic between March 2020 and May 2020 across several key locations at the Detroit Riverfront Parks in Detroit, Michigan. The sensing framework is validated by comparing automatic sensing results with manually labeled ground-truth results. The proposed approach significantly improves the efficiency of providing spatial and temporal statistics of users in public open spaces by creating straightforward data visualizations for federal and state agencies. The results can also provide on-time triggering information for an alarming or actuator system which can later be added to intervene inappropriate behavior during this pandemic.","Sun, Peng; Draughon, Gabriel; Lynch, Jerome",,32,1

Telemedicine was incorporated into clinical workflows and much preventive care, including Hepatitis C (HCV) testing, was not routinely performed. OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact that the COVID-19 rapid restructuring response has had on HCV testing and identification hospital-wide and in ambulatory settings. METHODS: BMC utilizes reflex confirmatory testing for HCV. When a sample is HCV Ab positive, it is automatically reflexed for confirmatory RNA and genotype testing. HCV test results for patients were collected daily. We compared unique patient tests for 3.5 month periods before and after March 16th, 2020. Descriptive statistics showed total tests and total new HCV RNA+ before versus after, both hospital-wide and in ambulatory clinics alone. Mean daily tests completed were compared. RESULTS: Hospital-wide, total HCV testing decreased by 49.6%, and new HCV+ patient identification decreased by 42.1%. In ambulatory clinics, testing decreased by 71.9%, and new HCV+ identification decreased by 63.3%. Hospital-wide, mean daily tests decreased by 22.9 tests per day (95% CI: 17.9-28.0, P < .001), and mean daily new HCV+ identification decreased by 0.36 (95% CI: 0.20-0.53, P < .001). In ambulatory clinics, mean daily tests decreased by 22.1 tests per day (95% CI: 17.5-26.7, P < .001) and mean daily HCV+ decreased by 1.40 (95% CI: 1.03-1.76, P < .001). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 systematic emergency response led to decreased HCV testing and identification, and in this regard telemedicine acts as a barrier to HCV care. Other public health initiatives must be monitored in the context of telemedicine workflows. Continued monitoring of HCV screening trends is vital, and adaptive approaches to work toward the goal of HCV elimination are needed.","Sperring, Heather; Ruiz-Mercado, Glorimar; Schechter-Perkins, Elissa M",J Prim Care Community Health,32,16

However, considerable geographical disparities in the distribution of COVID-19 incidence existed among different cities. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of sociodemographic factors on COVID-19 incidence of 342 cities in China from a geographic perspective. METHODS: Official surveillance data about the COVID-19 and sociodemographic information in China's 342 cities were collected. Local geographically weighted Poisson regression (GWPR) model and traditional generalized linear models (GLM) Poisson regression model were compared for optimal analysis. RESULTS: Compared to that of the GLM Poisson regression model, a significantly lower corrected Akaike Information Criteria (AICc) was reported in the GWPR model (61953.0 in GLM vs. 43218.9 in GWPR). Spatial auto-correlation of residuals was not found in the GWPR model (global Moran's I = - 0.005, p = 0.468), inferring the capture of the spatial auto-correlation by the GWPR model. Cities with a higher gross domestic product (GDP), limited health resources, and shorter distance to Wuhan, were at a higher risk for COVID-19. Furthermore, with the exception of some southeastern cities, as population density increased, the incidence of COVID-19 decreased. CONCLUSIONS: There are potential effects of the sociodemographic factors on the COVID-19 incidence. Moreover, our findings and methodology could guide other countries by helping them understand the local transmission of COVID-19 and developing a tailored country-specific intervention strategy.","Zhang, Huihui; Liu, Yini; Chen, Fangyao; Mi, Baibing; Zeng, Lingxia; Pei, Leilei",BMC Infect Dis,32,13

Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is a human protease required for SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral entry and may represent such a target. We hypothesized that drugs selected from proteins related by their tertiary structure, rather than their primary structure, were likely to interact with TMPRSS2. We created a structure-based phylogenetic computational tool named 3DPhyloFold to systematically identify structurally similar serine proteases with known therapeutic inhibitors and demonstrated effective inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in vivo. Several candidate compounds, avoralstat, PCI-27483, antipain, and soybean trypsin inhibitor, inhibited TMPRSS2 in biochemical and cell infection assays.

Real-time PCR is the reference method for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, the unprecedented increase in the number of infections worldwide calls for faster and easy methods that do not require skilled personnel and special equipment. Rapid antigen tests have been developed and used as first line screening. Here, we assessed the performance of a rapid antigen test in comparison to a real-time qualitative PCR as gold standard. Fifty nasopharyngeal swabs from suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been tested by Coris coronavirus disease 2019 Ag Respi-Strip test and Allplex 2019n-CoV assay. Of the 50 nasopharyngeal swabs tested, 11 were negative by both tests, 27 were negative by Ag test but positive by real-time PCR, and 12 were positive by both methods. PCR detected the 39 positive samples at a median cycle threshold (Ct) value of 22.78 (mean: 24.51; range: 13.59-39.6). In the 12 concordant samples, the median Ct value was 17.37. The sensitivity of the Ag test was 30.77% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.02%-47.57%), specificity 100% (95% CI: 71.51%-100.00%), positive predictive value 100%, negative predictive value 85.25% (95% CI: 82.42%-87.69%), and accuracy 86.15% (95% CI: 73.45%-94.28%).

The Co-doped magnetite nanoparticles formed a spinel phase with lattice parameters in the range of 8.355-8.422 Å and tended to agglomerate with the particle sizes of 7-12 nm. The presence of the first and second layers from oleic acid and DMSO was detected by the infrared spectrum as well as the olive oil used as a carrier liquid. The saturation magnetization of the superparamagnetic samples decreased from 24.4 to 4.8 emu/g with decreasing Co2+ composition. The particle size and electrostatic forces between the magnetic particles and the microbes played an essential role in inhibiting microbial growth. Interestingly, the increasing Co2+ composition enhanced the superior performance of the ferrofluids against E. coli, S. aureus, B. subtilis, and C. albicans . With additional extensive investigation, we believe that the prepared Co-doped magnetite double-layered ferrofluids from natural sand with superior antimicrobial performance can be new significant antimicrobial agents.","Taufiq, Ahmad; Eko Saputro, Rosy; Yuliantika, Defi; Sunaryono, Sunaryono; Diantoro, Markus; Hidayat, Arif; Hidayat, Nurul; Munasir, Munasir",,32,20

While these measures helped prevent the community spread of the virus, the resulting environmental benefits of lockdown remained mostly unnoticed. While many studies documented improvements in air quality index, very few have explored the reduction in black carbon (BC) aerosols and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) concentrations due to lockdown. In this study, we evaluated the changes in concentrations of BC, PAHs, and PM2.5 before and during the lockdown period. Our results show that lockdown resulted in a significant reduction in concentrations of these pollutants. The average mass concentration of BC, PAHs, and PM2.5 before the lockdown was 11.71 ± 3.33 µgm-3, 108.71 ± 27.77 ngm-3, and 147.65 ± 41.77 µgm-3, respectively. During the lockdown period, the concentration of BC, PAHs, and PM2.5 was 2.46 ± 0.95 µgm-3, 23.19 ± 11.21 ngm-3, and 50.31 ± 11.95 µgm-3, respectively. The diagnostic ratio analysis for source apportionment showed changes in the emission sources before and during the lockdown. The primary sources of PAHs emissions before the lockdown were biomass, coal combustion, and vehicular traffic, while during the lockdown, PAHs emissions were primarily from the combustion of biomass and coal. Similarly, before the lockdown, the BC mass concentrations came from fossil-fuel and wood-burning, while during the lockdown period, most of the BC mass concentration came from wood-burning. Human health risk assessment demonstrated a significant reduction in risk due to inhalation of PAHs and BC-contaminated air.","Ambade, Balram; Kurwadkar, Sudarshan; Sankar, Tapan Kumar; Kumar, Amit",Air Qual Atmos Health,32,1

METHODS: In this RCT, SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients aged 18-85 years with asymptomatic to mild COVID-19 symptoms <8 days were recruited. A total of 176 eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to CDCM or placebo. Three rinses daily were performed for 7 days. Saliva sampling was performed on day 1 at 9 a.m. (T1), 1 p.m. (T2) and 6 p.m. (T3). On the following 6 days, one sample was taken at 3 p.m. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The intention-to-treat analysis demonstrated that, over the course of one day, CDCM was significantly more effective than placebo 4 hours after the first dose (p=0.036), with a median percentage (log10 copies/mL) decrease T1-T2 of -12.58% [-29.55% - -0.16%]. The second dose maintained the low median value for the CDCM (3.08 log10 copies/mL [0 - 4.19]), compared to placebo (3.31 [1.18 - 4.75]). At day 7, there was still a greater median percentage (log10 copies/mL) decrease in salivary viral load over time in the CDCM group (-58.62% [-100% - -34.36%]) compared to placebo group (-50.62% [-100% - -27.66%]). These results were confirmed by the per-protocol analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This trial supports the relevance of using CDCM on day 1 (4 hours after the initial dose) to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in saliva. For long term effect (7 days), CDMC appears to provide a modest benefit compared to placebo in reducing viral load in saliva.","Carrouel, Florence; Valette, Martine; Gadea, Emilie; Esparcieux, Aurélie; Illes, Gabriela; Langlois, Marie Elodie; Perrier, Hervé; Dussart, Claude; Tramini, Paul; Ribaud, Mélina; Bouscambert-Duchamp, Maude; Bourgeois, Denis",Clin. microbiol. infect,32,20

How does the COVID-19 epidemic influence consumption? Using high-frequency payment system panel data, we explicitly consider the individual consumption changes and the substitution effect between online and offline markets of multiple categories by constructing autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models and conducting regression analyses. The p value and regression coefficients of the substitution elasticity are used to estimate the changes and the substitution effects from the offline to the online channels. The results show that consumption saw a remarkable decline after the surge of COVID-19 in 2020 compared to 2019. Overall, online markets were more resilient than the offline markets and the substitution effects after the epidemic's outbreak between the online and offline markets were significant for one-third of the consumption categories. However, the online market could not replace the offline market for some categories due to the product characteristics. The vulnerable industries in the face of the epidemic's intervention are determined as being traditional catering, transportation, tourism, and education, and the shortage of healthcare services in extreme events is also pointed out. The results provide suggestions for policies on targeted enterprises and public service.","Xu, Jie; Gao, Ming; Zhang, Yina",Growth change,32,10

METHODS: The available mRNA and miRNA microarray datasets were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database according to pre-determined screening criteria. Differentially expressed miRNA and mRNAs (DEmiRNAs and DEmRNAs) were extracted between NPC and noncancerous nasopharyngeal tissues. The target genes of DEmiRNAs were predicted with miRTarBase followed by the construction of DEmiRNAs-target DEmRNAs network, and functional analyses were performed. The DEmiRNAs expressions were validated and the performance of these DEmiRNAs was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) values. Finally, the correlations between DEmiRNAs and specific clinical factors were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 1140 interaction pairs (including let-7d/f-MYC/HMGA2 and miR-452-ITGA9) in DEmiRNAs-target DEmRNAs network. The GO annotation analysis showed that several genes such as MYC, HMGA2 and ITGA9 primarily participated in cellular process. KEGG analysis showed that these targets were associated with cell cycle and cancer-related pathways. Down-regulated let-7(-d and -f) and up-regulated miR-452 were verified in datasets. The AUC values of these 3 DEmiRNAs (let-7d, let-7-f and miR-452) was 0.803, 0.835 and 0.735, respectively. Besides, miR-452 was significantly related to survival rate of NPC patients. CONCLUSION: The findings implied let-7d/f-MYC/HMGA2 and miR-452-ITGA9 might be promising targets for the detection and treatment of NPC.","Liu, Lei; Wang, Hailing; Yan, Chaohui; Tao, Shudong",Technol Cancer Res Treat,32,0

As mediators, technostress is positively associated with psycho-physical disorders, whereas self-efficacy is negatively associated. As regards mediated effects, results showed negative associations between organizational communication and psycho-physical disorders through both technostress and self-efficacy. This study highlighted the potential protective role of organizational communication that could buffer the effect of technostress and enhance a personal resource, self-efficacy, which is functional to the reduction of psycho-physical disorders.

This survey aimed to assess the psychological impact of the state of emergency. We estimated changes in mental health, quality of life, and unemployment experience for general workers during the first COVID-19 outbreak in Japan. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide follow-up study. During the periods of March 26 to April 6, 2020 and June 26 to July 2, 2020, we used the internet to survey general workers aged 15 to 59 years in Japan. The questionnaire items covered employment status and socioeconomic factors, and we used the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and EQ-5D-5L to assess depression and health-related quality of life (HR-QOL), respectively. The differences in outcomes of permanent and non-permanent workers were analyzed using propensity score analysis. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between unemployment and CES-D scores. RESULTS: We included 2351 subjects in the analysis. Changes in both CES-D scores and utility were not significantly different between the two groups. However, a significant difference was found regarding the rate of unemployment, which was associated with higher CES-D scores. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that the mental health of non-permanent workers was not negatively affected following the state of emergency due to COVID-19 in Japan.

In 21 healthy immunocompetent subjects all of whom demonstrated circulating IgG antibodies 4 months after mRNA1273 or BNT162b vaccination, a) the strength of S-IgG was stable while RBD-IgG declined, b) S2-reactive B-cell frequencies increased progressively (p=0.002) c) S1-reactive CD8+T-cells and CD19+B-cells were undetectable after a transient increase, and d) monocytic and polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSC, PMN-MDSC) increased after the first vaccine dose. Compared with 4-month measurements from immunocompetent subjects, single samples from 20 vaccinated immunocompromised (IC) subjects revealed a) circulating S-IgG and RBD-IgG in 13 (65%) and 9 (45%) subjects, respectively, b) no differences in S2-reactive T- and B-cells, c) undetectable S1-reactive T- and B-cells, and d) fewer S-reactive CD8+T-cells and CD19+B-cells (p<0.05). Among 11 IC recipients who failed to make RBD-IgG, frequencies of PMN-MDSC were significantly higher (p<0.0004) compared with IC or immunocompetent subjects with RBD-IgG. COVID-19 vaccination induces stable antibodies to the spike protein and expands circulating B-cells reactive to the conserved spike protein sequence in immunocompetent subjects. MDSC which are known to suppress T- and B-cells, and which increase after vaccination, may limit post-vaccination responses especially among immunocompromised subjects. Antibody and cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2-specific spike antigenic sequences appear to be less durable.","Sindhi, Rakesh; Ashokkumar, Chethan; Singh, Vineeta; Spishock, Brianna; Saunders, Maggie; Mabasa, Angelo; Sindhi, Elizabeth; Sethi, Pradeep; Reddy, Ashok; Subramaniam, Shankar; Nibhanupudy, Bobby",,32,16

Therefore, a scoping review was conducted to identify challenges faced by caregivers of children with neurodevelopmental disorders during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to consolidate parenting interventions and guidelines. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on Embase, PsycInfo, PubMed, Scopus, and LitCovid. All article types published between December 2019 and November 2020 which reported on intervention guidelines and experiences of families with children with neurodevelopmental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Qualitative themes, quantitative data, and article summaries were charted, and a thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Twenty-nine articles were included in the review. Three themes were generated: (a) behavioral issues and health concerns, (b) disruptions of lifelines and daily routines, and (c) existing programs, models, and guidelines to support families. Additionally, a list of caregiver strategies such as scheduling regular online consultations, maintaining online therapy, educating a child on COVID-19, and preventive behaviors, creating a structured daily schedule and reinforcement system, and selecting child-appropriate activities was consolidated. CONCLUSION: This review revealed a lack of evidence-based studies and articles on children with other neurodevelopmental disorders apart from autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. It also places emphasis on the importance of telehealth services as major lifelines to parents during this pandemic and urges healthcare organizations to provide funding to increase telehealth services to afflicted families.","Shorey, Shefaly; Lau, Lydia Siew Tiang; Tan, Jia Xuan; Ng, Esperanza Debby; Ramkumar, Aishworiya",J. pediatr. psychol,32,24

The main object of the current research was to estimate the antiviral activity of cannabinoids (CBDs) against the human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In the presented research work, we performed in silico and in vitro experiments to aid the sighting of lead CBDs for treating the viral infections of SARS-CoV-2. Virtual screening was carried out for interactions between 32 CBDs and the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme. Afterward, in vitro antiviral activity was carried out of five CBDs molecules against SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, among them, two CBDs molecules namely &#916; (Yu et al., 2020 [9])-tetrahydrocannabinol (IC50â¯=â¯10.25â¯µM) and cannabidiol (IC50â¯=â¯7.91â¯µM) were observed to be more potent antiviral molecules against SARS-CoV-2 compared to the reference drugs lopinavir, chloroquine, and remdesivir (IC50 ranges of 8.16-13.15â¯µM). These molecules were found to have stable conformations with the active binding pocket of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by molecular dynamic simulation and density functional theory. Our findings suggest cannabidiol and &#916; (Yu et al., 2020 [9])-tetrahydrocannabinol are possible drugs against human coronavirus that might be used in combination or with other drug molecules to treat COVID-19 patients.","Raj, Vinit; Park, Jae Gyu; Cho, Kiu-Hyung; Choi, Pilju; Kim, Taejung; Ham, Jungyeob; Lee, Jintae",Int. j. biol. macromol,32,16

METHODS: An institutional database from a single NCI-designated cancer center identified 266 patients with p16+ OPSCC treated with definitive CRT in our department from 2005-2016 with evaluable pre-treatment FDG-PET scans. Quantitative SUV metrics and qualitative imaging metrics were determined from FDG-PET and CT scans, while clinical characteristics were abstracted from the medical record. Associations between clinical/imaging features and time to LR (TTLRF) or DM (TTDMF) failure and overall survival (OS) were assessed using univariable Cox regression and penalized stepwise regression for multivariable analyses (MVA). RESULTS: There were 27 LR and 32 DM recurrences as incident failures. Imaging biomarkers were significantly associated with TTLRF, TTDMF and OS. FDG-PET metrics outperformed CT and clinical metrics for TTLRF, with metabolic tumor volume being the only significant feature selected on MVA: C-index=0.68 (p=0.01). Radiographic extranodal extension (rENE), positive retropharyngeal nodes (RPN+), and clinical stage were significant on MVA for TTDMF: C-index=0.84 (p<0.001). rENE, group stage, and RPN+ were significant on MVA for OS: C-index=0.77 (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In the largest study to date of uniformly treated patients with CRT to evaluate both pretreatment CT and FDG-PET, radiographic biomarkers were significantly associated with TTLRF, TTDMF and OS among patients with p16+ OPSCC treated with CRT. CT metrics performed best to predict TTDMF, while FDG-PET metrics showed improved prediction for LRRFS. These metrics may help identify candidates for treatment intensification or de-escalation of therapy. STATEMENT OF TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Pre-treatment imaging features from standard-of-care PET/CT imaging show promise for predicting long-term outcomes following HPV-associated oropharynx cancer (HPV-OPC) therapy. This study comprehensively characterizes qualitative and quantitative pre-treatment imaging metrics associated with time to pattern-specific failure in a cohort of 266 patients treated uniformly with definitive chemoradiation. Multivariate analysis (MVA) for time to loco-regional failure (TTLRF), time to distant metastatic failure (TTDMF), and overall survival (OS) was performed. FDG-PET metrics outperformed CT and clinical metrics for TTLRF. CT radiographic extranodal extension, positive retropharyngeal nodes, and stage strongly predicted TTDMF (combined C-index=0.84, log rank p<0.001). Number of smoking pack-years complemented clinical and imaging features only in patients without radiographic extranodal extension or positive retropharyngeal nodes. Time to pattern-specific failure is important for guiding treatment de-escalation strategies, which intend to reduce treatment-related toxicity in patients with relatively long expected survival times. This study suggests that PET/CT features should play a crucial role in future de-escalation trials and management of HPV-OPC patients.","Rosen, Benjamin S; Wilkie, Joel R; Sun, Yilun; Ibrahim, Mohannad; Casper, Keith A; Miller, Jessa E; Chotchutipan, Thong; Stucken, Chaz L; Bradford, Carol; E P Prince, Mark; Rosko, Andrew J; Malloy, Kelly M; McLean, Scott A; Chinn, Steven B; Shuman, Andrew G; Spector, Matthew E; Swiecicki, Paul L; Worden, Francis P; Shah, Jennifer; Schonewolf, Caitlin A; Chapman, Christina H; Eisbruch, Avraham; Mierzwa, Michelle L",Radiother. oncol,32,16

Our article bridges this gap, mapping these ‘task forces’ so as to understand: i) their functions within policy-making during the pandemic;and ii) who are the experts sitting on these bodies and what expertise they bring to them. The analysis shows that the new advisory units were scarcely formalized, visible or transparent, and that (with some exceptions) they lacked influence.

Yet, the question regarding the possible role of these arthropods as SARS-CoV-2 passive/biological transmission vectors is still poorly explored. In this study, we performed in silico structural and binding energy calculations to assess the risks associated with possible ectoparasite transmission. We found sufficient similarity between ectoparasite ACE and human ACE2 protein sequences to build good quality 3D-models of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike:ACE complex to assess the impacts of ectoparasite mutations on complex stability. For several species (e.g., water flea, deer tick, body louse), our analyses showed no significant destabilisation of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike:ACE complex, suggesting these species would bind the viral Spike protein. Our structural analyses also provide structural rationale for interactions between the viral Spike and the ectoparasite ACE proteins. Although we do not have experimental evidence of infection in these ectoparasites, the predicted stability of the complex suggests this is possible, raising concerns of a possible role in passive transmission of the virus to their human hosts.","Lam, Su Datt; Ashford, Paul; Díaz-Sánchez, Sandra; Villar, Margarita; Gortázar, Christian; de la Fuente, José; Orengo, Christine",Viruses,32,16

While all but one organism isolated in the absence of triclosan were able to initiate growth on MacConkey agar, only one was able to initiate significant growth with triclosan present. In contrast, all bacteria selected with triclosan were identified as Pseudomonas spp. using 16S RNA gene sequencing and exhibited growth comparable to Pseudomonas aeruginosa controls in the presence of hydrophobic antibacterial agents to include triclosan.

However, there is a significant variability across cancer types in the extent of disease burden and modalities of cancer treatment that may impact morbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Therefore, we evaluated COVID-19 outcomes in patients with a differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) history. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with a history of DTC and SARS-CoV2 infection from 2 academic Los Angeles healthcare systems. Demographic, thyroid cancer, and treatment data were analyzed for associations with COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: Of 21 patients with DTC and COVID-19, 8 (38.1%) were hospitalized and 2 (9.5%) died from COVID-19. Thyroid cancer initial disease burden and extent, treatment, or current response to therapy (eg, excellent vs incomplete) were not associated with COVID-19 severity in DTC patients. However, older age and the presence of a comorbidity other than DTC were significantly associated with COVID-19 hospitalization (P = .047 and P = .024, respectively). COVID-19-attributed hospitalization and mortality in DTC patients was lower than that previously reported in cancer patients, although similar to patients with nonthyroid malignancies in these centers. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that among patients with DTC, advanced age and comorbid conditions are significant contributors to the risk of hospitalization from SARS-CoV2 infection, rather than factors associated with thyroid cancer diagnosis, treatment, or disease burden. This multicenter report of clinical outcomes provides additional data to providers to inform DTC patients regarding their risk of COVID-19.","Kathuria-Prakash, Nikhita; Mosaferi, Tina; Xie, Mindy; Antrim, Lauren; Angell, Trevor E; In, Gino K; Su, Maureen A; Lechner, Melissa G",Endocr. pract,32,6

We investigated whether metabolic biomarkers measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy could be associated with susceptibility to severe pneumonia (2507 hospitalised or fatal cases) and severe COVID-19 (652 hospitalised cases) in 105,146 generally healthy individuals from UK Biobank, with blood samples collected 2007-2010. The overall signature of metabolic biomarker associations was similar for the risk of severe pneumonia and severe COVID-19. A multi-biomarker score, comprised of 25 proteins, fatty acids, amino acids, and lipids, was associated equally strongly with enhanced susceptibility to severe COVID-19 (odds ratio 2.9 [95%CI 2.1-3.8] for highest vs lowest quintile) and severe pneumonia events occurring 7-11 years after blood sampling (2.6 [1.7-3.9]). However, the risk for severe pneumonia occurring during the first 2 years after blood sampling for people with elevated levels of the multi-biomarker score was over four times higher than for long-term risk (8.0 [4.1-15.6]). If these hypothesis generating findings on increased susceptibility to severe pneumonia during the first few years after blood sampling extend to severe COVID-19, metabolic biomarker profiling could potentially complement existing tools for identifying individuals at high risk. These results provide novel molecular understanding on how metabolic biomarkers reflect the susceptibility to severe COVID-19 and other infections in the general population.","Julkunen, Heli; Cichonska, Anna; Slagboom, P Eline; Würtz, Peter",eLife (Cambridge),32,1

Trifluoroacetic acid (10 mmol/L) was added to the upper organic phase, used as the stationary phase. One liter of the aqueous lower phase was used as the mobile phase for 0-350 min, and then 10 mmol/L ammonia was added to remaining 1 L of the aqueous lower phase and used as the mobile phase for 350-600 min. In total, 493.2 mg of baicalin with 98.6% purity and 88.6 mg of wogonoside with 98.9% purity were obtained from 1.0 g of crude exact of S. baicalensis by countercurrent chromatography in a single run. The acid dissociation constant (pKa) and oil-water partition coefficient values of two components were measured to better understand the mechanism of separation. Results showed that pH-peak-focusing countercurrent chromatography with a polar solvent system added with trifluoroacetic acid could be an efficient method for large-scale isolation of organic acids, which are difficult to separate with conventional countercurrent chromatography due to their poor solubility in non-polar solvents.","Wang, Chaoyue; Zuo, Guanglei; Wang, Xiang; Kim, Hyun Yong; Zhao, Shanshan; Sun, Wenyu; Tong, Shengqiang; Lim, Soon Sung",J. sep. sci,32,16

Major research operations that are unrelated to COVID-19 have been significantly diminished or suspended entirely because of either COVID-19-related legal restrictions or logistical, staffing or operational concerns. Billions of people globally are currently affected by lockdowns or curfews. Since the timescale of such restrictive measures is unknown and subject to change, many studies are now in limbo and the welfare of tens of thousands of study participants is at risk. These circumstances have introduced complex ethical challenges that merit urgent attention from international sponsors, researchers and regulators. Certain sponsors and regulators have published guidelines on how the COVID-19-related disruptions to clinical research should be managed. Although these guidelines provide a good starting point in navigating the challenges of the evolving pandemic, they only apply to those researchers funded or governed by these bodies. Here, we provide guidelines on managing such disruptions that apply beyond these specific settings. We highlight some of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on other ongoing research projects that are unrelated to COVID-19 and provide practical guidance on how the welfare of affected study participants should be managed.

OBJECTIVES: we aimed to assess the impact of the FLT on the communication with patients' family and friends (PFF), especailly around end-of-life care, and their interaction with CC clinicians. METHODS: A retrospective, mixed-methods analysis of a family liaison team (FLT) formed by redeployed clinicians in critical care (CC) during the first surge of the 2020 COVID 19 pandemic. RESULTS: The FLT was constituted predominantly of non-ICU consultants (30/39, 77%). Following two one-hourly webinars around basic communication skills, the FLT facilitated over 12,000 video and telephone calls with 172 patients' family and friends (PFF). The majority of the PFF interviewed were mostly, very or extremely satisfied with the frequency, ease, understanding, honesty, completeness, and consistency of the information provided. Approximately 5% of the interviewees reported to be slightly or very dissatisfied in one or more of the following 3 categories: frequency, consistency, and ease of getting the information. The thematic analysis identified 3 themes: 1) being there with/ for the patient; 2) breakdown in communication; 3) disbelief at the speed of deterioration. In 14.9% of cases there was documented discrepancy between the information transmitted by the CC team and that by the FLT, particularly around the severity of the patient's illness and their imminent death. CONCLUSION: The formation of a dedicated FLT was feasible and associated with high levels of satisfaction by the PFF. Friction was created when communication was not consistent and did not convey the severity of the patient's condition, to prepare the PFF for a bad outcome.","Lopez-Soto, Carmen; Bates, Eleanor; Anderson, Charlotte; Saha, Sian; Adams, Laura; Aulakh, Alex; Bowtell, Francesca; Buckel, Marie; Emms, Thomas; Shebl, Moustafa; Metaxa, Victoria",J. pain symptom manage,32,1

In order to diagnose COVID-19 more quickly, in this paper, a depthwise separable DenseNet was proposed. The paper constructed a deep learning model with 2 905 chest X-ray images as experimental dataset. In order to enhance the contrast, the contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) algorithm was used to preprocess the X-ray image before network training, then the images were put into the training network and the parameters of the network were adjusted to the optimal. Meanwhile, Leaky ReLU was selected as the activation function. VGG16, ResNet18, ResNet34, DenseNet121 and SDenseNet models were used to compare with the model proposed in this paper. Compared with ResNet34, the proposed classification model of pneumonia had improved 2.0%, 2.3% and 1.5% in accuracy, sensitivity and specificity respectively. Compared with the SDenseNet network without depthwise separable convolution, number of parameters of the proposed model was reduced by 43.9%, but the classification effect did not decrease. It can be found that the proposed DWSDenseNet has a good classification effect on the COVID-19 chest X-ray images dataset. Under the condition of ensuring the accuracy as much as possible, the depthwise separable convolution can effectively reduce number of parameters of the model.","Feng, Yibo; Qiu, Dawei; Cao, Hui; Zhang, Junzhong; Xin, Zaihai; Liu, Jing",Sheng Wu Yi Xue Gong Cheng Xue Za Zhi,32,21

The impact of surgical training has been described as ‘severe’ by most ophthalmology residents worldwide due to their duties in COVID-19 wards, disruption of outpatient and camp services. METHODS: Ophthalmic surgery demands utmost accuracy and meticulousness. Fine motor proficiencies, stereoscopic skills and hand–eye coordination required can only be achieved by practice. So, a multileveled structured wet-lab teaching schedule was prepared for the residents and implemented to bridge this gap between theory and practice at our tertiary care institute. A semester-wise training schedule was made with the proper distribution of wet-lab and simulator training. Surgeries like phacoemulsification, scleral buckling, pars plana lensectomy and vitrectomy, trabeculectomy and intravitreal injections were practised by the residents on the goat eyes. Simulator training was provided for phacoemulsification and vitrectomy to increase the hand–eye coordination of the residents. RESULTS: Residents noticed improvement in their surgical skills and ambidexterity post wet-lab and simulator training . It also increased their confidence and provided essential surgical skills required to be used in the operation theater later. CONCLUSION: It is imperative that wet-lab training be included in the residency training programme in this COVID-19 era.","Gupta, Parul Chawla; Singh, Ramandeep; Khurana, Surbhi; Behera, Ranjan Kumar; Thattaruthody, Faisal; Pandav, Surinder Singh; Ram, Jagat",Indian J Ophthalmol,32,14

Understanding the relationship between climate change and the health of populations adds further complexity to global health issues. Objectives: To describe four examples of curricula that exist in U.S. based graduate-level public and population health informatics training programs. Methods: Biomedical informatics educators are challenged to provide learners with relevant, interesting, and meaningful educational experiences in working with and learning from the many data sources that comprise the domain of PHI.

However, the intraocular pressure (IOP) changes caused by face masks remain unknown. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of wearing surgical and FFP2/N95 face masks during a 400-m walking protocol on IOP in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients. METHODS: Thirteen subjects diagnosed of POAG (21 eyes) were enrolled in this study. IOP was measured at baseline, during the 400-m walking protocol and after 5 min of passive recovery while POAG patients wore a surgical mask, FFP2/N95 mask and no mask in randomized order. From the 21 POAG eyes, we analyzed the IOP changes caused by physical exercise with two face masks and without wearing any face mask. RESULTS: At rest (baseline and recovery measurements), the use of the different face masks did not affect IOP levels (mean differences ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 mmHg). During physical activity, wearing an FFP2/N95 mask caused a small (mean differences ranging from 1 to 2 mmHg), but statistically significant, IOP rise in comparison to both the surgical mask and control conditions (Cohen’s d = 0.63 and 0.83, respectively). CONCLUSION: Face masks must be used to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and POAG patients can safely use FFP2/N95 and surgical masks at rest. However, due to the IOP rise observed while walking with the FFP2/N95 mask, when possible, POAG patients should prioritized the use of surgical masks during physical activity.","Janicijevic, Danica; Redondo, Beatríz; Jiménez, Raimundo; Lacorzana, Javier; García-Ramos, Amador; Vera, Jesús",Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,32,11

In this study we built a predictive model based on the cumulative trend of new cases and deaths for the top five provinces. we will also look at modeling the trends for confirmed cases deaths and recovered for the whole country. Method: In this study we have chosen to apply the exponential smoothing model to iteratively forecast future values of a regular time seires from weighted averages of past daily values of the series. This method is exponential because the value of each level is influenced by every preceeding actual value to an exponentially decreasing degree more recent values are given a greater weight. The available data is too small to identify seasonal patterns and make predictable variation in value, such as annual fluctuation in temperature relative to the season. Trend is a tendency in the data to increase or decrease over time. Results: If no control measures are put in place it is expected that over 40000 would be infected in Tehran around the middle of June. However if control measures were implemented with a high degree of success one would expect the spread of the COV19 virus would peak at the start of April with a downward trend dropping off by the end of May (70 days). In the scenario that no further measures are implemented, one would expect the spread of COVID19 to continue on a gentle incline reaching 21000 by mid-June. The same process has been applied to review the confirmed deaths and recovered dataset. The forecast has been carried out for the next 30 days a shorter timeframe has been selected as there is a high probability that the Iranian New Years celebration Farvardin first month of Spring (30th March in Western calendar) will have an impact on the infection rate following the event. The best predictive model predicts the confirmed cases to be in the range of 35000 70000 with the number of reported COVDI-19 deaths to be between 3000 5000 and 5000 30000 of recovered cases. Conclusions: Modeling outbreak ofCovid19 shows that the number of patients and deaths is still increasing. Contagious diseases follow an exponential model and the same be Haves this one. This is because the virus can spread to others and finally each person turns into a carrier of the virus and transmit it to another person. Disease control depends on disconnection and social distancing. In addition many factors are effective in stopping the disease. These include citizens participation in the prevention process health education the effectiveness of instructive traditions environmental conditions and so on.","Moghadami, Maryam; Hassanzadeh, Mohammad; wa, ka; Hedayati, Aziz; Malekolkalami, Mila",,32,1

In this work, two fragment identification tools namely SARpy and Laplacian-corrected Bayesian analysis were used for previous SARS-CoV PLpro and 3CLpro inhibitors. A robust and predictive SARpy based fragments identification was performed which have been validated further by Laplacian-corrected Bayesian model. These comprehensive approaches have advantages since fragments are straight forward to interpret. Moreover, distinguishing the key molecular features (with respect to ECFP_6 fingerprint) revealed good or bad influences for the SARS-CoV protease inhibitory activities.

SARS-CoV-2 affects the human respiratory tract's epithelial cells, leading to a proinflammatory cytokine storm and chronic lung inflammation. With numerous patients dying daily, a vaccine and specific antiviral drug regimens are being explored. Probiotics are live microorganisms with proven beneficial effects on human health. While probiotics as nutritional supplements are long practiced in different cuisines across various countries, the emerging scientific evidence supports the antiviral and general immune-strengthening health effects of the probiotics. Here, we present an overview of the experimental studies published in the last 10 years that provide a scientific basis for unexplored probiotics as a preventive approach to respiratory viral infections. Based on collated insights from these experimental data, we identify promising microbial strains that may serve as lead prophylactic and immune-boosting probiotics in COVID-19 management.","Singh, Kuljit; Rao, Alka",Nutr Res,32,26

However, the clinical application of IOS and computer-aided design/manufacturing (CAD/CAM) in implant-supported prosthodontics remains unclear. This study aimed to compare the accuracy of digital and silicone impressions for single-tooth implants for bounded edentulous spaces and two-unit and three-unit implant-supported fixed dental prostheses for free-end edentulous spaces. METHODS: This study enrolled 30 patients (n = 10 for each of the three groups) with an average age of 61.9 years. Conventional silicone-based and digital IOS-based impressions were made for all patients, and the implant superstructures were fabricated. We measured the scan-body misfit and compared the accuracy of the impressions for single-unit, two-unit, and three-unit implant prostheses with a bounded edentulous space by superimposing the standard triangulated language (STL) data obtained from IOS over the STL data of the plaster model used for final prosthesis fabrication. The scan bodies of the superimposed single-molar implant, two-unit implant prosthesis without teeth on the mesial side, two-unit implant prosthesis without teeth on the distal side, three-unit implant prosthesis without teeth on the mesial side, and three-unit implant prosthesis without teeth on the distal side were designated as A, B1, B2, C1, and C2, respectively. The misfit for each scan body was calculated and the accuracies were compared using the Tukey–Kramer method. RESULTS: The average scan-body misfit for conditions A, B1, B2, C1, and C2 was 40.5 ± 18.9, 45.4 ± 13.4, 56.5 ± 9.6, 50.7 ± 14.9, and 80.3 ± 12.4 μm, respectively. Significant differences were observed between the accuracies of A and B2, A and C2, and C1 and C2 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: IOS and CAD/CAM can find clinical applications for implant-supported prostheses of up to three units for a bounded edentulous saddle. The use of IOS could render implant treatment easier, benefiting both the surgeons and patients. Prosthesis maladjustment may lead to peri-implantitis and prosthetic fracture. Therefore, further validation of the accuracy of IOS impressions is required in patients with multiple missing teeth in long-span implant prostheses.","Nagata, Koudai; Fuchigami, Kei; Okuhama, Yurie; Wakamori, Kana; Tsuruoka, Hayato; Nakashizu, Toshifumi; Hoshi, Noriyuki; Atsumi, Mihoko; Kimoto, Katsuhiko; Kawana, Hiromasa",BMC Oral Health,32,16

The EU Cancer Mission and the European Beating Cancer Plan together provide an unrivalled opportunity to make significant inroads into a disease that kills over 1.7 million European citizens annually. Harnessing these twin pillars of cancer research and cancer control can be transformative for the European cancer community and in particular for the European cancer patient. However, from a research perspective, in order to fully realise these benefits, we need to ensure that all aspects of the cancer continuum are addressed. Previous research efforts have focussed more on the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, whereas cancer survivorship, to date, has been overlooked. Here, we aim to redress this balance, by identifying the key challenges in cancer survivorship research that need to be addressed and proposing a series of recommended solutions, which, if acted upon, would deliver significant benefits for the nearly 20 million cancer survivors in Europe. To achieve this, we propose the development of a clearly articulated and sustainably funded European Cancer Survivorship Research and Innovation Plan.

Here we present a 1 year follow-up of a patient with a secondary tension pneumothorax due to COVID-19 pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: In May 2020, a 47-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department with fever, dry cough, and sore throat as well as acute chest pain and shortness of breath. Sputum testing (polymerase chain reaction, PCR) and computed tomography (CT) confirmed infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Eleven days after discharge, the patient returned to the emergency department with pronounced dyspnoea after coughing. CT showed a right-sided tension pneumothorax, which was relieved by a chest drain (Buelau) via mini open thoracotomy. For a period of 3 months following resolution of the pneumothorax the patient complained of fatigue with mild joint pain and dyspnoea. After 1 year, the patient did not suffer from any persisting symptoms. The pulmonary function and blood parameters were normal, with the exception of slightly increased levels of D-Dimer. The CT scan revealed only discrete ground glass opacities (GGO) and subpleural linear opacities.

SARS-CoV-2 infection stimulates antigen-specific antibody responses. Multiple serologic tests have been developed for SARS-CoV-2. However, which antigens are most suitable for serological testing remains poorly understood. Specifically, which antigens have the highest sensitivity and specificity for serological testing and which have the least cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses are currently unknown. Previous studies have shown that the S1 domain of the spike (S) protein has very low cross-reactivity between epidemic coronaviruses and common human coronaviruses, whereas the S2 domain of the S protein and the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) show low-level cross-reactivity. Therefore, S1 is considered more specific than the native homotrimer of the S protein, and the receptor-binding domain as an antigen to test patient antibodies is more sensitive than the native N protein. In addition, an increasing number of studies have used multiantigen protein arrays to screen serum from convalescent patients with COVID-19. Antigen combinations demonstrated improved performance compared to each individual antigen. For rapid antigen detection, the sensitivity of the test is higher in the first week of onset of the disease with high viral loads. Highly sensitive and specific immunological diagnostic methods for antibodies or those that directly detect viral antigens in clinical samples would be beneficial for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Li, Dandan; Li, Jinming",J Clin Microbiol,32,29

Therefore, they have a high risk of falls, which leads to severe health and psychological consequences and can induce fear of falling. Rehabilitation programs using exergames to prevent falls are being increasingly studied. Medimoov is a movement-based patient-personalized exergame for rehabilitation in older adults. A preliminary study showed that its use may influence functional ability and motivation. Most existing studies that evaluate the use of exergames do not involve an appropriate control group and do not focus on patient-personalized exergames. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effects of Medimoov on risk of falls and fear of falling in older adults compared with standard psychomotor rehabilitation. METHODS: This is a serial, comparative, randomized controlled group study. Both groups (n=25 in each) will receive psychomotor rehabilitation care. However, the methods of delivery will be different; one group will be exposed to the Medimoov exergame platform, and the other only to traditional means of psychomotor rehabilitation. The selection criteria will be (1) age of 65 years or older, (2) ability to answer a questionnaire, (3) ability to stand in a bipedal position for at least 1 minute, (4) score of 13 or greater on the Short Fall Efficacy Scale, and (5) stable medical condition. An evaluation will be made prior to starting the intervention, after 4 weeks of intervention, and at the end of the intervention (after 8 weeks), and it will focus on (1) risk of falls, (2) fear of falling, and (3) cognitive evaluations. Physical activity outside the session will also be assessed by actimetry. The outcome assessment will be performed according to intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: The protocol (2019-11-22) has been approved by the Comité de Protection des Personnes Nord-Ouest I–Université de Rouen (2019-A00395-52), which is part of the French national ethical committee. The study received funding in February 2020. As of October 2020 (submission date), and due to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a total of 10 participants out of 50 had been enrolled in the study. The projected date for the end of the data collection is December 2021. Data analyses have not been started yet, and publication of the results is expected for Spring 2022.

In 2020 retaining skilled experienced nurses continues to be a major global challenge. The dominant and consistent concentration of workforce research to date has focused on attitudinal factors including job satisfaction and burnout and there is limited research on how organisational commitment in combination with job satisfaction and burnout may explain what keeps nurses in nursing. OBJECTIVES: : To measure how organisational commitment in combination with job satisfaction and burnout relate to the intention of Registered General Nurses’ staying in nursing (ITSN). DESIGN & METHODS: : A quantitative descriptive design using a cross-sectional survey was utilised. A national postal survey of a representative sample of registered general nurses employed within the Republic of Ireland (ROI) health services was undertaken in 2010. A number of established valid and reliable instruments were used to measure attitudinal factors and their relationship with intention to stay (ITSN). Data were analysed using IBM SPSS version 24.0 and descriptive, correlational and multiple regression analysis were undertaken. RESULTS: : A total of 756 registered nurses participated in this study. The strongest predictor of intention to stay in nursing was organisational commitment (β=.32, p=.000) while burnout and job satisfaction had a significant relationship with ITSN. CONCLUSION: : Results reveal the complex and multidimensional nature of ITSN with the majority of nurses having a strong intention to stay in nursing. Organisational commitment and low burnout represented predictors which are influential in nurses remaining in nursing throughout their career lifespan. These results remain relevant in 2020 particularly in light of the ongoing pandemic when retention and recruitment of skilled and experienced nurses to the workforce will be critical to the management of health care, considering the increased nurse vacancy rates in many countries and the evident lack of resolution of the issues raised from this study.","BELL, Mary; Sheridan, Ann",Int J Nurs Stud Adv,32,16

We aimed to explore the risk factors of 14-day and 28-day mortality and develop a model for predicting 14-day and 28-day survival probability among adult hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this multicenter, retrospective, cohort study, we examined 828 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized in Wuhan Union Hospital and Central Hospital of Wuhan between January 12 and February 9, 2020. Among the 828 patients, 516 and 186 consecutive patients admitted in Wuhan Union Hospital were enrolled in the training cohort and the validation cohort, respectively.

Demographic, clinical, radiographic, and laboratory measures; treatment; proximate causes of death; and 14-day and 28-day mortality are described. Patients’ data were collected by reviewing the medical records, and their 14-day and 28-day outcomes were followed up. RESULTS: Of the 828 patients, 146 deaths were recorded until May 18, 2020. In the training set, multivariate Cox regression indicated that older age, lactate dehydrogenase level over 360 U/L, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio higher than 8.0, and direct bilirubin higher than 5.0 μmol/L were independent predictors of 28-day mortality. Nomogram scoring systems for predicting the 14-day and 28-day survival probability of patients with COVID-19 were developed and exhibited strong discrimination and calibration power in the two external validation cohorts (C-index, 0.878 and 0.839).

This manuscript aimed at reviewing published papers for sampling and detection of corona viruses, especially SARS-Cov-2 as a global health concern. It was found that SARS-Cov 2 was present in some air samples that were collected from patient's rooms in hospitals. This result warrants its airborne transmission potential. However, due to the fact that in the most reviewed studies, sampling was performed in the patient's room, it seems difficult to discriminate whether it is airborne or is transmitted through respiratory droplets. Moreover, some other disrupting factors such as patient distance from the sampler, using protective or oxygen masks by patients, patient activities, coughing and sneezing during sampling time, air movement, air conditioning, sampler type, sampling conditions, storage and transferring conditions, can affect the results.

Summary Background Data Gastrointestinal involvement has been described in COVID-19; however, no clear figures of incidence, epidemiology and economic impact exist for de-novo surgical diseases in hospitalized patients Methods This is a prospective study including all patients admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 rT-PCR, between 1 March and 15 May 2020 at two Tertiary Hospitals. Patients with known surgical disease at admission were excluded. Sub-analyses were performed with a consecutive group of COVID-19 patients admitted during the study period, who did not require surgical consultation. Results Ten out of 3089 COVID-19 positive patients (0.32%) required surgical consultation. Among those admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) incidence was 1.9%. Mortality was 40% in patients requiring immediate surgery and 20% in those suitable for conservative management. The overall median length of stay(LOS) of patients admitted to ICU was longer in those requiring surgical consultation compared with those who did not (51.5 vs 25 days,p=0.0042). Patients requiring surgical consultation and treatment for de-novo surgical disease had longer median ICU-LOS (31.5 vs 12 days, p=0.0004). A median of two post-surgical complications were registered for each patient undergoing surgery. Complication-associated costs were as high as 38,962 USD per patient. Conclusions Incidence of de-novo surgical diseases is low in COVID-19, but it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Future studies should elucidate the mechanism underlying the condition and identify strategies to prevent the need for surgery.","Kraft, Miquel; Pellino, Gianluca; Jofra, Mariona; Sorribas, Maria; Solís-Peña, Alejandro; Biondo, Sebastiano; Espín-Basany, Eloy",Surgeon,32,18

We outline four key lessons learned from efforts to address the pandemic in China and the US. First, effective surveillance, reporting, and contact tracing are needed to contain an epidemic at its emergence and to mitigate its impact at a later stage. Second, multi-sectoral efforts to offer incentives for those with no or minor symptoms to seek care and to quarantine themselves are critical, which would need concerted efforts from payers, providers, and public health. Third, sustained and routine prevention efforts involving both the public and the health systems will prove to be useful in times of a pandemic. Fourth, a strong public health system is essential and will be appreciated at times of urgency. Concerted multi-sectoral efforts are required to address COVID-19 pandemic with strong leadership from the public health sector.","Chen, Zhuo; Cao, Cong; Yang, Gonghuan",Glob Health Res Policy,32,20

The aim of this study was to develop consensus-based aims, contents, intended learning outcomes, teaching, and evaluation methods of a history of medicine and pharmacy course for medical and pharmacy students in the Arab World. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Scopus, and Google Scholar was conducted to identify course aims, contents, intended learning outcomes from the literature. The search was supplemented by semi-structured in-depth interviews with 5 educators/academicians, 3 pharmacists, and 3 physicians. The Delphi technique was used among panelists (10 educators/academicians, 4 physicians, and 4 pharmacists) to develop consensus-based course aims, contents, intended learning outcomes, teaching, and evaluation methods. RESULTS: The vast majority of the panelists agreed on the 10 items (agreement ≥88.9%) on the importance of teaching history to medical and pharmacy students. Consensus-based aims (n = 4) and intended learning outcomes (n = 13) were developed in the 1st and 2nd iterative Delphi rounds. The panelists suggested that 16 dedicated meeting hours (1 credit hour) would be required to cover the course. Bloom’s verbs were used to target the lower and higher orders of the cognitive domain. The course could be taught through face-to-face lectures, provision of reading materials, video documentaries, case studies, group discussions and debates. Multiple-choice questions, written reflections, portfolios, group projects, and engagement in discussions and debates might be used to evaluate performance of students. CONCLUSION: Consensus-based course of history of medicine and pharmacy course was developed for medical and pharmacy students in the Arab World. Well-designed course aims, contents, intended learning outcomes, teaching, and evaluation methods are more likely to meet the accreditation requirements and might improve performance of medical and pharmacy students. Future studies are still needed to investigate if such consensus-based courses can improve performance of the students.

The total numbers of infected individuals have already crossed 2 million throughout the world. The government of all the affected countries have already taken many measures like lockdown to stop the spread. Therefore, it is important to study the nature of growth and interpretations are necessary for taking needful by the government. In this paper, we have tried to interpret the spreading capability of novel corona virus in India taking into consideration of 21 days lockdown data. The prediction is based on the present number of available cases and number of new cases reporting daily. We have explained the number of infected people in India comparing with Italy, China, Spain, and USA data of 21 days individually after announcing lockdown. The plot of daily new cases with the number of days spent after lockdown is fitted by linear and polynomial function. The best fitted graph is chosen for interpretation and that is based on the parameters obtained from fitting. The forecast of maximum spreading possibility is discussed with linear and 4-degree polynomial fitting parameters.

During the first term, various national social distancing measures were introduced, including banning groups of >6 people and the second lockdown in November; however, outbreaks among university students occurred. We aimed to measure the University of Bristol staff and student contact patterns via an online, longitudinal survey capturing self-reported contacts on the previous day. We investigated the change in contacts associated with COVID-19 guidance periods: post-first lockdown (23/06/2020–03/07/2020), relaxed guidance period (04/07/2020–13/09/2020), ‘rule-of-six’ period (14/09/2020–04/11/2020) and the second lockdown (05/11/2020–25/11/2020). In total, 722 staff (4199 responses) and 738 students (1906 responses) were included in the study. For staff, daily contacts were higher in the relaxed guidance and ‘rule-of-six’ periods than the post-first lockdown and second lockdown. Mean student contacts dropped between the ‘rule-of-six’ and second lockdown periods. For both staff and students, the proportion meeting with groups larger than six dropped between the ‘rule-of-six’ period and the second lockdown period, although was higher for students than for staff. Our results suggest university staff and students responded to national guidance by altering their social contacts. Most contacts during the second lockdown were household contacts. The response in staff and students was similar, suggesting that students can adhere to social distancing guidance while at university. The number of contacts recorded for both staff and students were much lower than those recorded by previous surveys in the UK conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic.","Trickey, Adam; Nixon, Emily; Christensen, Hannah; Finn, Adam; Thomas, Amy; Relton, Caroline; Montgomery, Clara; Hemani, Gibran; Metz, Jane; Walker, Josephine G.; Turner, Katy; Kwiatkowska, Rachel; Sauchelli, Sarah; Danon, Leon; Brooks-Pollock, Ellen",Epidemiol Infect,32,4

METHODS: In this prospective, multicentered study, we evaluated the safety and outcomes of treatment with CPT and/or REM in 1315 hospitalized COVID-19 patients over 18 years in 31 hospitals across Nepal. REM was administered to patients with moderate, severe, or life-threatening infection. CPT was administered to patients with severe to life-threatening infections who were at high risk for progression or clinical worsening despite REM. Clinical findings and outcomes were recorded until discharge or death. RESULTS: Patients were classified as having moderate (24.2%), severe (64%), or life-threatening (11.7%) COVID-19 infection. The majority of CPT and CPT + REM recipients had severe to life-threatening infections (CPT 98.3%; CPT + REM 92.1%) and were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU; CPT 91.8%; CPT + REM 94.6%) compared with those who received REM alone (73.3% and 57.5%, respectively). Of 1083 patients with reported outcomes, 78.4% were discharged and 21.6% died. The discharge rate was 84% for REM (n = 910), 39% for CPT (n = 59), and 54.4% for CPT + REM (n = 114) recipients. In a logistic model comparing death vs discharge and adjusted for age, gender, steroid use, and severity, the predicted margin for discharge was higher for recipients of remdesivir alone (0.82; 95% CI, 0.79–0.84) compared with CPT (0.58; 95% CI, 0.47–0.70) and CPT + REM (0.67; 95% CI, 0.60–0.74) recipients. Adverse events of remdesivir and CPT were reported in <5% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a safe rollout of CPT and REM in a resource-limited setting.

As of 22 March, 2020, South Korea reported 8897 confirmed cases of and 104 deaths from COVID-19. Methods: We collected the number of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths in South Korea from the World Health Organization (as of 21 March, 2020) and case distribution and fatality rates by age from the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (as of 22 March, 2020). We estimated population-level mortality rates by fitting a negative binomial regression model with the number of deaths as the outcome and population by age as an offset. We then calculated the age-standardized death rate (ASDR) based on the current COVID-19 figures and for alternative scenarios of increased prevalence. Findings: The COVID-19 population-level mortality rate (per 100,000 person-years) increased with age: from 0.1 deaths among 30-39 year olds to 9.5 deaths among ≥80 year olds. The ASDR (per 100,000 person-years) was 0.8 deaths. The ASDR would increase to 52.0 deaths at a 1% prevalence (becoming the third leading cause of death) and 155.9 deaths at 3% prevalence (becoming the leading cause of death). Interpretation: Currently, the population-level mortality burden of COVID-19 in South Korea, as measured by the ASDR, was relatively low compared to other causes of death partly due to the low prevalence of COVID-19. If the prevalence increases from another outbreak, the mortality burden could increase substantially and surpass other leading causes.","Soneji, Samir; Beltrán-Sánchez, Hiram; Yang, JaeWon; Mann, Caroline",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,32,5

Studies of the Ag-RDTs have shown variable performance. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assessed the clinical accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of commercially available Ag-RDTs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We registered the review on PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42020225140). We systematically searched multiple databases (PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, medRvix, bioRvix, and FIND) for publications evaluating the accuracy of Ag-RDTs for SARS-CoV-2 up until 30 April 2021. Descriptive analyses of all studies were performed, and when more than 4 studies were available, a random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity in comparison to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. We assessed heterogeneity by subgroup analyses, and rated study quality and risk of bias using the QUADAS-2 assessment tool. From a total of 14,254 articles, we included 133 analytical and clinical studies resulting in 214 clinical accuracy datasets with 112,323 samples. Across all meta-analyzed samples, the pooled Ag-RDT sensitivity and specificity were 71.2% (95% CI 68.2% to 74.0%) and 98.9% (95% CI 98.6% to 99.1%), respectively. Sensitivity increased to 76.3% (95% CI 73.1% to 79.2%) if analysis was restricted to studies that followed the Ag-RDT manufacturers’ instructions. LumiraDx showed the highest sensitivity, with 88.2% (95% CI 59.0% to 97.5%). Of instrument-free Ag-RDTs, Standard Q nasal performed best, with 80.2% sensitivity (95% CI 70.3% to 87.4%). Across all Ag-RDTs, sensitivity was markedly better on samples with lower RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values, i.e., <20 (96.5%, 95% CI 92.6% to 98.4%) and <25 (95.8%, 95% CI 92.3% to 97.8%), in comparison to those with Ct ≥ 25 (50.7%, 95% CI 35.6% to 65.8%) and ≥30 (20.9%, 95% CI 12.5% to 32.8%). Testing in the first week from symptom onset resulted in substantially higher sensitivity (83.8%, 95% CI 76.3% to 89.2%) compared to testing after 1 week (61.5%, 95% CI 52.2% to 70.0%). The best Ag-RDT sensitivity was found with anterior nasal sampling (75.5%, 95% CI 70.4% to 79.9%), in comparison to other sample types (e.g., nasopharyngeal, 71.6%, 95% CI 68.1% to 74.9%), although CIs were overlapping. Concerns of bias were raised across all datasets, and financial support from the manufacturer was reported in 24.1% of datasets. Our analysis was limited by the included studies’ heterogeneity in design and reporting. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we found that Ag-RDTs detect the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2-infected persons within the first week of symptom onset and those with high viral load. Thus, they can have high utility for diagnostic purposes in the early phase of disease, making them a valuable tool to fight the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

In vivo the antiserum reacted specifically with a 30-kDa protein synthesized in MHV-A59- and MHV-JHM-infected cells. This 30-kDa protein could not be identified in purified virions and is therefore a nonstructural viral protein. The expression pattern of this 30-kDa nonstructural viral protein in infected cells was shown to be identical to that of the viral structural proteins. However, in comparison to the nucleocapsid protein pulse-chase studies revealed a relative short half life for this 30-kDa protein in vivo.","Bredenbeek, Peter J.; Noten, Ans F.H.; Horzinek, Marian C.; Spaan, Willy J.M.",Virology,32,24

It is affecting the entire planet and we focus in Spain, where the first case was detected at the end of January 2020 and in recent weeks it has increased in many cases. We need predictive models in order to be efficient and take actions. The general goal of this work is present a new model of SARS-CoV-2 to predict different scenarios of accumulated cases in Spain. Material and methods: In this short report is used a model proposed previously, based on a parametric model Weibull and in a the library BDSbiost3 developed in R to infer and predict different scenarios of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 for the accumulated cases in Spain after the spread that affects Spain detected at the end of January of this year. Results: In the analyses presented, projective curves have been generated for the evolution of accumulated cases in which they reach about 4,000 cases or about 15,000 cases, for which the lines of the day in which the value for 90 will be reached can be seen vertically 90, 95 and 99% of the asymptote (maximum number of cases, from that day they will begin to descend or remain the same), that is why the vertical lines would indicate the brake of the disease. For the worst-case scenario, it takes 118, 126 or 142 days to reach the maximum number of cases (n = 15,000) to reach 90, 95 and 99% of the asymptote (maximum number of cases), respectively. This means translated in a time scale that in the worst case the virus will not stop its progress, in Spain, until summer 2020, hopefully before.

This extraordinary dataset that accrued in near real time has also given us an opportunity to chart the global and local evolution of a virus as it moves through the world population. The data itself presents challenges that have never been dealt with in molecular epidemiology, and tracking a virus that is changing so rapidly means that we are often running to catch up. Here we review what is known about the evolution of the virus, and the critical impact that whole genomes have had on our ability to trace back and track forward the spread of lineages of SARS-CoV-2. We then review what whole genomes have told us about basic biological properties of the virus such as transmissibility, virulence, and immune escape with a special emphasis on pediatric disease. We couch this discussion within the framework of systematic biology and phylogenetics, disciplines that have proven their worth again and again for identifying and deciphering the spread of epidemics, though they were largely developed in areas far removed from infectious disease and medicine.","Moustafa, Ahmed M; Planet, Paul J",J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,32,24

The investigation of antimalarials for COVID-19 has also been a driver for a deluge of scientific output in a short amount of time. In this narrative review, we detail the evidence for and against antimalarial use in COVID-19, starting with the early small observational studies that influenced strategies worldwide. We then contrast these findings to later published larger observational studies and randomized controlled trials. We detail the emerging possible cardiovascular risks associated with antimalarial use in COVID-19, and whether COVID-19-related outcomes and cardiovascular risks may differ for antimalarials used in rheumatic diseases.","Egeli, Bugra Han; Sparks, Jeffrey A.; Kim, Alfred H.J.; Liew, Jean W.",Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol,32,24

ABSTRACT: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, Cancer Centers adopted specific procedures both to protect patients and to monitor the possible spread of SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare personnel (HCP). In April 2020 at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milano, one of the three oncologic hubs in Lombardy where the Health Regional Authorities referred all the cancer patients of the region, we implemented a prospective longitudinal study aimed at monitoring the serological response to SARS-Cov-2 in HCP. One hundred and ten HCP answered a questionnaire and were screened by nasopharyngeal swabs as well as for IgM/IgG levels; seropositive HCPs were further screened every 40–45 days using SARS-CoV-2-specific serology. We identified a fraction of HCP with long-term anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses, though negative for viral RNA, and thus probably able to safely approach fragile cancer patients. Monitoring asymptomatic HCP might provide useful information to organize the healthcare service in a Cancer Center, while waiting for the effectiveness of the active immunization by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, which will provide protection from infection.","Ciniselli, Chiara Maura; Micali, Arianna; De Cecco, Loris; Notti, Paola; Sinno, Valentina; Luison, Elena; Melani, Cecilia C.; Daidone, Maria Grazia; Apolone, Giovanni; Verderio, Paolo; Figini, Mariangela",Cancers (Basel),32,33

It has concomitantly exposed the risks of staffing and skills shortages and the importance of protecting the health workforce. The present commentary focuses on highlighting some of the lessons learnt, challenges and future needs of the health workforce in Europe in the context of COVID‐19. During the pandemic innovative and flexible approaches were implemented to meet increasing demand for health workers and new skills and responsibilities were adopted over a short period of time. We have seen the rapid adaptation and use of new technologies to deliver care. The pandemic has underlined the importance of valuing, protecting and caring for our health workforce and the need to invest appropriately and adequately in the health workforce to have sufficient, capable and well‐motivated health workers. Some of the main challenges that lie ahead of us include the imperative for better investment, to need to improve recruitment and retraining whilst better retaining health workers, a focus on domestic sustainability, redeploying and developing new skills and competences among health workers, enabling more effective multi‐professional collaboration and team work, improving the quality of education and training, increasing the public health focus and promoting ethical and sustainable international recruitment of health workers.

In the last decades, substantial reductions have been made in the number of measles cases, with an estimated 20 million deaths averted from 2000 to 2017 [2]. Yet, an important feature of epidemic dynamics is that large outbreaks can occur following years of apparently successful control [3]. Such ‘post-honeymoon period’ outbreaks are a result of the non-linear dynamics of epidemics [3]. Anticipating post-honeymoon outbreaks could lead to substantial gains in public health, helping to guide the timing, age-range and location of catch-up vaccination campaigns [4]. Theoretical conditions for such outbreaks are well-understood for measles, yet the information required to make these calculations policy-relevant is largely lacking. We propose that a major extension of serological studies to directly characterize measles susceptibility is a high priority.","Metcalf, C.J.E.; Wesolowski, A.; Winter, A.

Mandatory social and physical distancing measures (SPDM) were introduced on 23 March 2020 to attempt to limit transmission. AIM: To describe the impact of SPDM on COVID-19 activity as detected through the different surveillance systems. METHODS: Data from national population surveys, web-based indicators, syndromic surveillance, sentinel swabbing, respiratory outbreaks, secondary care admissions and mortality indicators from the start of the epidemic to week 18 2020 were used to identify the timing of peaks in surveillance indicators relative to the introduction of SPDM. This timing was compared with median time from symptom onset to different stages of illness and levels of care or interactions with healthcare services. RESULTS: The impact of SPDM was detected within 1 week through population surveys, web search indicators and sentinel swabbing reported by onset date. There were detectable impacts on syndromic surveillance indicators for difficulty breathing, influenza-like illness and COVID-19 coding at 2, 7 and 12 days respectively, hospitalisations and critical care admissions (both 12 days), laboratory positivity (14 days), deaths (17 days) and nursing home outbreaks (4 weeks). CONCLUSION: The impact of SPDM on COVID-19 activity was detectable within 1 week through community surveillance indicators, highlighting their importance in early detection of changes in activity.

In the first scenario we assume that the parameters of the second wave in Illinois would be similar to those currently observed in other states such as Arizona, Florida, and Texas. We estimate doubling times of hospitalizations and test positivity in all states with relevant publicly available data and calculate the corresponding effective reproduction numbers for Illinois. These parameters are remarkably consistent in states with rapidly growing epidemics. We conjecture that the emergence of the second wave of the epidemic in these states can be attributed to superspreading events at large parties, crowded bars, and indoor dining. In our second, more optimistic scenario we assume changes in Illinois state policy would result in successful mitigation of superspreading events and thus would lower the effective reproduction number to the value observed in late June 2020. In this case our calculations show effective suppression of the second wave in Illinois. Our analysis also suggests that the logarithmic time derivatives of COVID-19 hospitalizations and case positivity can serve as a simple but strong early-warning signal of the onset of a second wave.","Weiner, Z.; Wong, G.; Elbanna, A.; Tkachenko, A.; Maslov, S.; Goldenfeld, N.",,32,20

Some available therapies (antimalarials, antivirals, biological agents) were grounded on clinical case observations or basic science data. The aim of this study is to describe the characteristics and impact of different therapies on clinical outcomes in a cohort of severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center, observational study, we collected sequential data on adult patients admitted to Hospital Universitario Quironsalud Madrid. Eligible patients should have a microbiological (positive test on RT-PCR assay from a nasal swab) or an epidemiological diagnosis of severe COVID-19. Demographic, baseline comorbidities, laboratory data, clinical outcomes, and treatments were compared between survivors and non-survivors. We carried out univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to assess potential risk factors for in-hospital mortality. FINDINGS: From March 10th to April 15th, 2020, 607 patients were included. Median age was 69 years [interquartile range, {IQR} 22; 65% male). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (276 [46·94%]), diabetes (95 [16·16%]), chronic cardiac (133 [22·62%]) and respiratory (114 [19·39%]) diseases. 141 patients (23·2%) died. In the multivariate model the risk of death increased with older age (odds ratio, for every year of age, 1·15, [95% CI 1·11 - 1·2]), tocilizumab therapy (2·4, [1·13 - 5·11]), C-reactive protein at admission (1·07, per 10 mg/L, [1·04 - 1·10]), d-dimer > 2·5 μg/mL (1·99, [1·03 - 3·86]), diabetes mellitus (2·61, [1·19 - 5·73]), and the PaO(2)/FiO(2) at admission (0·99, per every 1 mmHg, [0·98 - 0·99]). Among the prescribed therapies (tocilizumab, glucocorticoids, lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, cyclosporine), only cyclosporine was associated with a significant decrease in mortality (0·24, [0·12 - 0·46]; p<0·001). INTERPRETATION: In a real-clinical setting, inhibition of the calcineurin inflammatory pathway, NF-κΒ, could reduce the hyperinflammatory phase in COVID-19.

Autoimmune patients may be at higher risk of developing infection due to the impaired immune responses, the use of immunosuppressive drugs, and damage to various organs. Increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines and intolerance of the patient’s immune system to COVID-19 infection are the leading causes of hospitalization of these patients. The content used in this paper has been taken from English language articles (2005–2020) retrieved from the PubMed database and Google Scholar search engine using “COVID-19,” “Autoimmune disease,” “Therapeutic,” “Pathogenesis,” and “Pathway” keywords. The emergence of COVID-19 and its association with autoimmune disorders is a major challenge in the management of these diseases. The results showed that the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of autoimmune diseases can make diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 more challenging by preventing the fever. Due to the common pathogenesis of COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases, the use of autoimmune drugs as a possible treatment option could help control the virus.

ACE2 is a type 1 integral membrane protein and contains a catalytically active ectodomain that can be shed from the cell surface into the extracellular space, via cleavage by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM-17). ACE2 enzymatic activity and protein can be detected in biological fluids, including urine, plasma, and conditioned cell culture media. We present a detailed method for measurement of ACE2 activity in biological fluids, using hydrolysis of an intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic ACE2 substrate, in the absence or presence of the ACE2 inhibitors MLN-4760 or DX600. Recombinant human or mouse ACE2 is used to generate standard curves for this assay, with ACE2 detection ranging from 1.56 to 50 ng/ml. While MLN-4760 potently inhibits the activity of both human and mouse ACE2, DX600 (linear form) only effectively blocks human ACE2 activity in this assay. In biological samples of human and mouse urine, cell culture medium from mouse proximal tubular cells, and mouse plasma, the mean intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) of the assay range from 1.43 to 4.39 %, and from 7.01 to 13.17 %, respectively. We present data on the time and substrate concentration dependence of the assay, and show that exogenous d -glucose, creatinine, urea, and albumin do not interfere with its performance. In biological fluids, this assay is a simple and reliable method to study the role of ACE2 and its shed fragments in cardiovascular and renal diseases.","Xiao, Fengxia; Burns, Kevin D.",Hypertension,32,26

This study investigates the depression level and coping responses toward the lockdown, referred as the movement control order (MCO) during COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia and its impact on quality of life. METHOD: This cross-sectional study was conducted from April to May 2020. The outcomes were assessed using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale–21, Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory, and World Health Organisation Quality of Life–BREF Scale (WHOQOL-BREF) in both English and validated Malay versions. RESULTS: Mild-to-severe depression was found in 28.2% (n = 149) of the 528 respondents. Respondents with mild-to-severe depression were significantly younger (33.09 ± 10.08 versus 36.79 ± 12.47 years), without partner (71.8% versus 45.6%), lived in the red zone (85.9% versus 71.0%), and had lower household income as defined in the category of B40 (51.7% versus 39.3%) compared to those without depression (all p < 0.01). The avoidant coping score was significantly higher (25.43 ± 5.69 versus 20.78 ± 5.65), while the religious coping score was significantly lower (5.10 ± 2.07 versus 5.94 ± 2.11) among those with mild-to-severe depression compared to those without depression (both p < 0.001). Respondents with mild-to-severe depression also had significantly lower mean score in each domain of WHOQOL-BREF compare to those without depression [(physical health, 13.63 ± 2.66 versus 16.20 ± 2.11), (psychological, 12.5 ± 2.79 versus 16.10 ± 2.14), (social relationships, 12.17 ± 3.49 versus 15.28 ± 2.93), environment (14.50 ± 2.39 versus 16.21 ± 2.14), all p < 0.001] after controlling for age, marital status, zone, household income, and coping scores. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 lockdown had adverse mental health effects. Our study highlighted that approximately one in three individual experienced mild-to-severe depression during the nationwide MCO. The varied impact of the pandemic on mental health could be due to different population characteristics and coping strategies used. Identifying those at higher risk to develop depression during MCO for COVID-19 pandemic could help mental healthcare service providers to plan services for those susceptible, thereby mitigating the pandemic’s effect on quality of life.","Yee, Anne; Hodori, Nur ‘Aqilah Mohd; Tung, Yu-Zhen; Ooi, Po-Lin; Latif, Saiful Adni B.

Subsequently, in what became known as the 20/80 rule, a small percentage of individuals within any population was observed to control most transmission events. This empirical rule was shown to govern inter-individual transmission dynamics for many pathogens in several species, and individuals who infect disproportionately more secondary contacts, as compared to most others, became known as super-spreaders. Studies conducted in the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic revealed that, in the absence of super-spreading events, most individuals infect few, if any, secondary contacts. The analysis of SARS transmission, and reports from other outbreaks, unveil a complex scenario in which super-spreading events are shaped by multiple factors, including co-infection with another pathogen, immune suppression, changes in airflow dynamics, delayed hospital admission, misdiagnosis, and inter-hospital transfers. Predicting and identifying super-spreaders open significant medical and public health challenges, and represent important facets of infectious disease management and pandemic preparedness plans.","Stein, Richard A.",Int J Infect Dis,32,5

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was rapidly identified as the critical functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is well-known as a counter-regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and plays a key role in the cardiovascular system. Given that ACE2 functions as both a SARS-CoV-2 receptor and a RAS modulator, the treatment for COVID-19 presents a dilemma of how to limit virus entry but protect ACE2 physiological functions. Thus, an in-depth summary of the recent progress of ACE2 research and its relationship to the virus is urgently needed to provide possible solution to the dilemma. Here, we summarize the complexity and interplay between the coronavirus, ACE2 and RAS (including anti-RAS drugs). We propose five novel working modes for functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the routes of ACE2-mediated virus entering host cells, as well as its regulatory mechanism. For the controversy of anti-RAS drugs application, we also give theoretical analysis and discussed for drug application. These will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex mechanisms of underlying the relationship between the virus and ACE2, and provide guidance for virus intervention strategies.","Bian, Jingwei; Li, Zijian",Acta Pharm Sin B,32,21

Pneumonia results from the proliferation of microorganisms at these sites in combination with the host response to the presence of microorganisms. A variety of pneumonia syndromes can be defined based on microbial etiology, underlying host defenses, clinical presentation, and site of acquisition. Because of the non-specific nature of the signs and symptoms, the diagnosis of pneumonia rests disproportionately on the presence of an infiltrate on chest radiograph. The frequent lack of a microbiologic diagnosis and the non-specificity of signs, symptoms, and radiographic infiltrates leads to frequent consideration of pneumonia in the differential diagnosis of many other pulmonary diseases. The etiologic spectrum of all types of pneumonia always includes the common community-acquired pathogens, with the spectrum broadening in response to either increasing immunocompromise or greater exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics. While new or previously unrecognized pathogens can play a role in management decisions, the major issue in pneumonia is the appearance of antibiotic resistant strains of known common bacterial pathogens. Lack of even minimally effective agents is more the issue for nonbacterial pneumonias. Immunomodulation, in the form of less immunosuppressive cancer and transplant chemotherapy, immunization, or specific immunomodulatory drugs holds some hope for improving pneumonia outcome in the future.","Wunderink, R.G.; Mutlu, G.M.",Encyclopedia of Respiratory Medicine,32,26

We have described a patient with COVID-19-associated mucormycosis and, searched and analyzed current medical literature to delineate the characteristics of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis. METHOD: We reported a patient developed mucormycosis during post-COVID period. We searched literature to describe the incidence, clinical features, and outcomes of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis. Demographic features, risk factors, clinical features, diagnostic methods, treatment and outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: We describe a 54-year-old male, hospitalized due to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. He was given long-term, high doses of systemic steroids. He developed maxillo-fascial mucormycosis and died of sepsis. Our literature search found 30 publications describing 100 patients including present case report. The majority (n = 68) were reported from India. 76% were male. The most commonly seen risk factors were corticosteroid use (90.5%), diabetes (79%), and hypertension (34%). Also, excessive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics were noted in cases.

Exploring the factors that influence the continuous adoption of WOAs is helpful to strengthen the health education of middle-aged and elderly individuals. OBJECTIVE: We developed a new theoretical model and explored the factors that influence middle-aged and elderly individuals' continuous usage intention for HM-WOA. Performance expectancy mediated the effects of the model in explaining continuous usage intention and introduced health literacy into the model. METHODS: We established a hybrid theoretical model on the basis of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 model (UTAUT2), the health belief model (BHM), protection motivation theory (PMT), and health literacy. We collected valid responses from 396 middle-aged and elderly users aged ≥ 45 years in China. To verify our hypotheses, we analyzed the data using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: Performance expectancy (β = 0.383, P < 0.001), hedonic motivation (β = 0.502, P < 0.001), social influence (β = 0.134, P = 0.049), and threat appraisal (β = 0.136, P < 0.001) positively influenced middle-aged and elderly users' continuous usage intention. Perceived health threat (β = − 0.065, P = 0.053) did not have a significant effect on continuous usage intention. Both threat appraisal (β = 0.579, P < 0.001) and health literacy (β = 0.579, P < 0.001) positively affected performance expectancy. Threat appraisal indirectly affected continuous usage intention through performance expectancy mediation. CONCLUSIONS: Our new theoretical model is useful for understanding middle-aged and elderly users' continuous usage intention for HM-WOA.

A high triglyceride to high density lipoprotein cholesterol (Tg/HDL c) ratio has been associated with reduced insulin sensitivity, metabolic syndrome and adverse cardiovascular events. Our aim in this study was to determine the association between different components of the lipid profile and particularly the Tg/HDL c ratio with severe complications like the requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients. Methods We collected demographic, clinical and biochemical data to conduct a cohort study in 43 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) at baseline and in the subsequent 15 days. Patients were subjected to a very similar treatment scheme with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. Descriptive statistics, variable association and logistic regression were applied to identify predictors of disease severity among elements and calculations from the lipid profile. Results Patients were aged 57±14 years; 55.8% were male from which 75% required hospitalization and 44.2% were female who 58% were hospitalized. The most common comorbidities were type 2 diabetes mellitus (58%) and hypertension (40%). Hospitalized and critical care patients showed lower HDL c blood levels and increased Tg/HDL c ratio than those with outpatient management and mild/asymptomatic COVID-19. Tg/HDL c ratio correlated with variables of disease severity such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (r=0.356; p<0.05); the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS 2)(r=0.495; p<0.01); quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA)(r=0.538; p<0.001); increased need of oxygen support (r=0.447; p<0.01) and requirement of mechanical ventilation (r=0.378; p<0.05). Tg/HDL c ratio have a negative correlation with partial oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen (SaO2/FiO2) ratio (r=-0.332;p<0.05). Linear regression analysis showed that Tg/HDL c ratio can predict increases in inflammatory factors like LDH (p<0.01); ferritin (p<0.01) and D-dimer (p<0.001). Logistic regression model indicated that ≥ 7.45 Tg/HDL c ratio predicts requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 11.815, CI 1.832-76.186, p<0.01).

However, their central role in media, official reports and decision-making may be undeserved and misleading. Previously published Infection Fatality Rates were weighted by age structure in the 50 countries with more reported deaths to obtain country-specific rates. For each country, the number of infections up to the Infection Date (23 days ago = Incubation Period + Onset to Death period) and the present percentage of immune population were estimated using Infection Fatality Rate, the number of reported deaths (which is less prone to undersampling), and projecting back to Infection Date. We then estimated a Detection Index for each country as the percentage of estimated infections that confirmed cases represent. Assuming that detection remains constant after Infection Date, we estimated the number of deaths and the estimated percentage of the population of each country expected to be immune up to 23 days into the future. Estimated Infection Fatality Rates are higher in Europe. In most countries, confirmed cases currently represent less than 30% of estimated infections on Infection Date, and this value decreases with time. Countries with flat curves throughout the pandemic show the lowest immunity percentages and these values seem unlikely to change in the near future, suggesting that they remain vulnerable to new outbreaks. Estimates for some countries with low Infection Fatality Rates suggest a still steep increase in the number of casualties in the next three weeks. Countries that did not control initial outbreaks seem to have reached higher immunity percentages, although mostly still under 5%. We provide the code to monitor the trajectories of these estimates in 178 countries throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.","Macias-Ordonez, R.; Villasenor-Amador, D.",,32,26

Although the range of friend-related activities appeared to be severely constrained during quarantine, the Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) needs to be carefully examined, especially in relation to problematic social networking site use (PSNSU). Indeed, FoMO might enhance individuals' need to stay connected and communicate with other people, leading to PSNSU, in order to face the fear of being invisible in the world of social media in circumstances of physical isolation. The present study sought to evaluate the predictive role of FoMO on PSNSU during the COVID-19 pandemic, testing the mediating effect of online relational closeness and online communication attitude. A total of 487 Italian adults (59.3% women), aged between 18 and 70 years (mean age = 29.85 years; SD = 9.76), responded to an online survey during the period of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Italy. The survey included self-report measures assessing perceived FoMO, online communication attitude, relational closeness with online friends, and PSNSU. Participants declared they spent significantly more time social networking during the pandemic, particularly women. The total model accounted for a significant amount of variance in participants' PSNSU [R(2) = 0.54; F((9, 447)) = 58.285, p < 0.001). Despite the other people's social rewarding experiences had been drastically reduced by the lockdown, findings showed a direct effect of FoMO on PSNSU. Moreover, FoMO had an effect on online communication attitude and online relational closeness, although only online communication attitude predicted, in turn, PSNSU. Conversely, relational closeness on social networking sites did not predict PSNSU. The present study suggests that, during COVID-19 lockdown, FoMO levels may have strengthened attitudes toward online communication, which, in turn, may have put some individuals at risk of PSNSU.","Gioia, Francesca; Fioravanti, Giulia; Casale, Silvia; Boursier, Valentina",Front Psychiatry,32,16

METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients with prolonged PCR positivity. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either leflunomide (50 mg, q12h, three consecutive times, orally; then 20 mg, once daily for 8 days), in addition to nebulized interferon alpha 2a (IFN α-2a, 3 million IU each time, twice daily for 10 days), or nebulized IFN α-2a alone for 10 days. The primary end point was the duration of viral shedding. RESULTS: A total of 50 COVID-19 patients with prolonged PCR positivity were randomized into 2 groups; 26 were assigned to the leflunomide group, and 24 were assigned to the interferon alone group. Treatment with leflunomide was not associated with a difference from the interferon alone group in the duration of viral shedding (hazard ratio for negative RT-PCR, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.391-1.256; P=0.186).

Once the rate of infection is manageable, governments must implement strategies that reverse the negative effects of the lockdowns. A decision support system based on fuzzy theory and multi-criteria decision analysis principles is proposed to investigate the importance of a set of key indicators for post-COVID-19 reopening strategies. This system yields more reliable results because it considers the hesitation and experience of decision makers. By including 16 indicators that are utilized by international organizations for comparing, ranking, or investigating countries, our results suggest that governments and policy makers should focus their efforts on reducing violence, crime and unemployment. The provided methodology illustrates the suitability of decision science tools for tackling complex and unstructured problems, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments, policy makers and stakeholders might find in this work scientific-based guidelines that facilitate complex decision-making processes.","Almulhim, Tarifa S.; Barahona, Igor",Qual Quant,32,1

The Italian Society of Gynecology and Obstetrics (SIGO), and the Multicenter Italian Trials in Ovarian cancer and gynecologic malignancies (MITO) promoted a national survey aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical activity of gynecologist oncologists and to assess the implementation of containment measures against COVID-19 diffusion. METHODS: The survey consisted of a self-administered, anonymous, online questionnaire. The survey was sent via email to all the members of the SIGO, and MITO groups on April 7, 2020, and was closed on April 20, 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 604 participants completed the questionnaire with a response-rate of 70%. The results of this survey suggest that gynecologic oncology units had set a proactive approach to COVID-19 outbreak. Triage methods were adopted in order to minimize in-hospital diffusion of COVID-19. Only 38% of gynecologic surgeons were concerned about COVID-19 outbreak. Although 73% of the participants stated that COVID-19 has not significantly modified their everyday practice, 21% declared a decrease of the use of laparoscopy in favor of open surgery (19%). However, less than 50% of surgeons adopted specific protection against COVID-19. Additionally, responders suggested to delay cancer treatment (10%–15%), and to perform less radical surgical procedures (20%–25%) during COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: National guidelines should be implemented to further promote the safety of patients and health care providers. International cooperation is of paramount importance, as heavily affected nations can serve as an example to find out ways to safely preserve clinical activity during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Bogani, Giorgio; Apolone, Giovanni; Ditto, Antonino; Scambia, Giovanni; Panici, Pierluigi Benedetti; Angioli, Roberto; Pignata, Sandro; Greggi, Stefano; Scollo, Paolo; Delia, Mezzanzanica; Franchi, Massimo; Martinelli, Fabio; Signorelli, Mauro; Lopez, Salvatore; Di Donato, Violante; Valabrega, Giorgio; Ferrandina, Gabriella; Palaia, Innocenza; Bergamini, Alice; Bocciolone, Luca; Savarese, Antonella; Ghezzi, Fabio; Casarin, Jvan; Pinelli, Ciro; Trojano, Vito; Chiantera, Vito; Giorda, Giorgio; Sopracordevole, Francesco; Malzoni, Mario; Salerno, Giovanna; Sartori, Enrico; Testa, Antonia; Zannoni, Gianfranco; Zullo, Fulvio; Vizza, Enrico; Trojano, Giuseppe; Chiantera, Antonio; Raspagliesi, Francesco",J Gynecol Oncol,32,26

Here, we present, for the first time, peptide-based assemblies that can kill viruses. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the assemblies is in the range tens of micrograms per milliliter. This value is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the MIC of metal nanoparticles. When applied on a surface, by drop casting, the peptide spherical assemblies adhere to the surface and form an antiviral coating against both RNA- and DNA-based viruses including coronavirus. Our results show that the coating reduced the number of T4 bacteriophages (DNA-based virus) by 3 log, compared with an untreated surface and 6 log, when compared with a stock solution. Importantly, we showed that this coating completely inactivated canine coronavirus (RNA-based virus). This peptide-based coating can be useful wherever sterile surfaces are needed to reduce the risk of viral transmission.","Hu, Tan; Agazani, Omer; Nir, Sivan; Cohen, Mor; Pan, Siyi; Reches, Meital",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),32,16

Therefore, this paper aims to examine various firms' organizational social responses to COVID-19 as an external crisis, particularly in terms of the way organizations use their resources to address social problems and the real intention behind these, and the changing organizational drivers influencing such behaviors. Design/methodology/approach The authors explore the initiatives of seven organizations from three different industries in several countries and their actions in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. A case study approach was taken to collect data and reach a conclusion. A combination of interviews, online communication using semi-structured questionnaires and documentary information available in the public domain was used to collect data and analyze and triangulate the events. Findings Similar internal resources and capacities of the seven organizations resulted in similar responses as they launched proactive initiatives to prepare sanitizers. This research indicates that these organizations pursued other goals besides economic one. When society needed help, these organizations responded quickly, using and reorganizing their resources to assist communities in need. Different organizations from different sectors all behaved in a similar manner, making genuine contributions to the pandemic as each was uniquely capable of doing. These organizations also used their unique capabilities to offer their resources to local communities and governments. Originality/value During the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts by corporate entities to facilitate social reform and recovery have been seen around the globe. The findings could help in understanding the responses of organizations engaging in socially responsible behaviors to overcome external crises. This paper also identifies changing organizational values and their possible impact on society and overall industry philanthropy practices in the future.","Ahmed, J. U.; Islam, Q.

We aimed to explore the influence of demographic factors, clinical manifestations and underlying comorbidities on mortality in MERS-CoV patients. Retrospective chart reviews were performed to identify all laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-COV infection in Saudi Arabia that were reported to the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia between 23 April 2014 and 7 June 2016. Statistical analyses were conducted to assess the effect of sex, age, clinical presentation and comorbidities on mortality from MERS-CoV. A total of 281 confirmed MERS-CoV cases were identified: 167 (59.4%) patients were male and 55 (20%) died. Mortality predominantly occurred among Saudi nationals and older patients and was significantly associated with respiratory failure and shortness of breath. Of the 281 confirmed cases, 160 (56.9%) involved comorbidities, wherein diabetes mellitus, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease and chronic kidney disease were significantly associated with mortality from MERS-CoV and two or three comorbidities significantly affected the fatality rates from MERS-CoV. The findings of this study show that old age and the existence of underlying comorbidities significantly increase mortality from MERS-CoV.","Alqahtani, F.Y.; Aleanizy, F.S.; Ali El Hadi Mohamed, R.; Alanazi, M.

Methods: We performed a cross-over study to investigate the influence of wearing a ballistic vest on reaction and response time, lumbar muscle endurance and police vehicle entry and exit times. Reaction and response time was based on a perturbation setup where the officers’ pelvises were fixed and EMG of lumbar and abdominal muscles was recorded. We used a modified Biering–Sørensen test to assess the lumbar muscle endurance and measured duration of entry and exit maneuvers in a variety of standard-issue police cars. Results: There was a significant difference of 24% in the lumbar muscle endurance test (no vest: 151 s vs. vest: 117 s), and the police officers experienced higher physical fatigue after the test when wearing a vest. Furthermore, officers took longer to both enter and exit police cars when wearing a vest (range: 0.24–0.56 s) depending on the model of the vehicle. There were no significant differences in reaction and response times between the test conditions (with/without vest). Discussion and Conclusion: Wearing of a ballistic vest significantly influenced the speed of movement in entry and exit of police cars and lumbar muscle endurance, although it does not seem to affect reaction or response times. The ballistic vest seems to impair performance of tasks that require maximal effort, which calls for better designs of such vests.","Koblauch, Henrik; Zebis, Mette K.; Jacobsen, Mikkel H.; Haraldsson, Bjarki T.; Klinge, Klaus P.; Alkjær, Tine; Bencke, Jesper; Andersen, Lars L.",Sensors (Basel),32,0

In March 2021, we investigated stem rot of Chuanxiong in six adjacent fields (~100 ha) in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China. The disease incidence was above 5% in each field. Symptomatic plants showed stem rot, watersoaked lesions, and blackening with white hyphae present on the stems. Twelve symptomatic Chuanxiong plants (2 plants/field) were sampled. Diseased tissues from the margins of necrotic lesions were surface sterilized in 75% ethanol for 45 s, and 2% NaClO for 5 min. Samples were then rinsed three times in sterile distilled water and cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 25ºC for 72 h. Fourteen fungal cultures were isolated from 18 diseased tissues, of which eight monosporic isolates showed uniform characteristics. The eight fungal isolates showed fluffy white aerial mycelia and produced yellow pigments with age. Mung bean broth was used to induce sporulation. Macroconidia were sickle-shaped, slender, 3- to 5-septate, and averaged 50 to 70 µm in length. Based on morphological features of colonies and conidia, the isolates were tentatively identified as Fusarium spp. (Leslie and Summerell 2006). To identify the species, the partial translation elongation factor 1 alpha (TEF1-&#945;) gene was amplified and sequenced (O'Donnell et al. 1998). TEF1-&#945; sequences of LCSR01, LCSR02 and LCSR05 isolates (GenBank nos. MZ169386, MZ169388 and MZ169387) were 100%, 99.72% and 99.86% identical to that of F. asiaticum strain NRRL 26156, respectively. The phylogenetic tree based on TEF1-&#945; sequences showed these isolates clustered with F. asiaticum using Neighbor-Joining algorithm. Furthermore, these isolates were identified using the specific primer pair Fg16 F/R (Nicholson et al. 1998). The results showed these isolates (GenBank nos. MZ164938, MZ164939 and MZ164940) were 100% identical to F. asiaticum NRRL 26156. Pathogenicity test of the isolate LCSR01 was conducted on Chuanxiong. After wounding Chuanxiong stalks and rhizomes with a sterile needle, the wounds were inoculated with mycelia PDA plugs. A total of 30 Chuanxiong rhizomes and stalks were inoculated with mycelia PDA plugs, and five mock-inoculated Chuanxiong rhizomes and stalks served as controls. After inoculation, the stalks and rhizomes were kept in a moist chamber at 25°C in the dark. At 8 days post inoculation (dpi), all inoculated stalks and rhizomes exhibited water-soaked and blackened lesions. At 10 dpi, the stalks turned soft and decayed, and abundant hyphae grew on the exterior of infected plants, similar to those observed in the field. No disease symptoms were observed on the control plants. The pathogen was re-isolated from the inoculated tissues and the identity was confirmed as described above. Ten fungal cultures were re-isolated from the 10 inoculated tissues, of which nine fungal cultures were F. asiaticum, fulfilling Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of F. asiaticum causing stem rot of Chuanxiong in China. Chuanxiong has been cultivated in rotation with rice over multiple years. This rotation may have played a role in the increase in inoculum density in soil and stem rot epidemics in Chuanxiong. Diseased Chuanxiong may be contaminated with the mycotoxins produced by F. asciaticum, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol or nivalenol, which may deleteriously affect human health. Therefore, crop rotations should be considered carefully to reduce disease impacts.","Zhu, Tingting; Li, Linxuan; Petridis, Antonios; Xydis, George; Ren, Maozhi",Plant disease,32,16

Our hypothesis was that multiple pandemic-related factors led to a care environment with increased mental and spiritual stress for patients and their families, leading to an increased need for adjunct services such as chaplaincy. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a single-institution retrospective chart review study that evaluated the records of 10,698 patients admitted between July 1, 2019, and January 31, 2020, or between July 1, 2020, and January 31, 2021. Our primary study outcomes included the number of chaplain consultations, the number of visits per consultation, and the time of visits between the two study cohorts. Secondary outcomes included inpatient mortality and the number of end-of-life visits. We also isolated a subgroup of patients admitted with COVID-19 and compared their outcomes with the two larger cohorts. Statistical analysis included t-test or chi-squared test, based on the variable. This study was reviewed and approved by the Brooke Army Medical Center Institutional Review Board (IRB ID C.2021.010e). RESULTS Fewer consults were performed during the study period affected by the SARS-COV2 pandemic (4814 vs. 5884, P-value <.01). There were fewer individual visits per consult during the study period affected by the SARS-COV2 pandemic (1.44 vs. 1.64, P-value <.01), which led to fewer overall time spent per consult (37.41 vs. 41.19 minutes, P-value <.01). The 2020 cohort (without COVID-19 cases) demonstrated a higher mortality rate than the 2019 cohort (2.8% vs. 1.9%, P-value <.01). The COVID-19 diagnosis cohort demonstrated a much higher mortality rate compared to other patients in the 2020 cohort (19.3% vs. 2.8%, P-value <.01). We demonstrated the relative need for EOL consults by presenting the ratio of EOL consults to inpatient deaths. This ratio was highest for the COVID-19 diagnosis cohort (0.76) compared to the 2020 cohort (0.50) and the 2019 cohort (0.60). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that factors related to the SARS-COV2 pandemic resulted in fewer chaplaincy consults in our inpatient setting. We did not find other reports of a change in the rate of chaplaincy consultation, but available reports suggest that many centers have had difficulty balancing the spiritual needs of patients with local exposure guidelines. Although fewer individual chaplain consults occurred during the SARS-COV2 pandemic, our chaplain service innovated by utilizing various phone, video, and web-based platforms to deliver spiritual support to our community. Our study also suggests that the patients most greatly affected by the pandemic have an increased need for spiritual support, especially at the end of life. Future studies in this subject should examine the effect of various types of chaplain services as they relate to the health and well-being of hospitalized patients.","Bauer, Zaith; Sherwin, Joseph; Smith, Stanley; Radowsky, Jason",Military medicine,32,18

It is responsible for the deaths of millions of people and has caused global economic and social disruption. The numbers of COVID-19 cases are increasing exponentially across the world. Control of this pandemic disease is challenging because there is no effective drug or vaccine available against this virus and this situation demands an urgent need for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential medicines. In this regard, the main protease (Mpro) has emerged as an essential drug target as it plays a vital role in virus replication and transcription. In this research, we have identified two novel potent inhibitors of the Mpro (PubChem3408741 and PubChem4167619) from PubChem database by pharmacophore-based high-throughput virtual screening. The molecular docking, toxicity, and pharmacophore analysis indicate that these compounds may act as potential anti-viral candidates. The molecular dynamic simulation along with the binding free energy calculation by MMPBSA showed that these compounds bind to Mpro enzyme with high stability over 50 ns. Our results showed that two compounds: PubChem3408741 and PubChem4167619 had the binding free energy of − 94.02 kJ mol(−1) and − 122.75 kJ mol(−1), respectively, as compared to reference X77 (− 76.48 kJ mol(−1)). Based on our work’s findings, we propose that these compounds can be considered as lead molecules for targeting Mpro enzyme and they can be potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. These inhibitors could be tested in vitro and explored for effective drug development against COVID-19.

Here, we review the emerging coalescence of infectious disease epidemiology around a core set of study designs and statistical methods bearing little resemblance to the chronic disease epidemiology toolkit. We offer our outlook on challenges and opportunities facing the field, including the integration of novel molecular and digital information sources into disease surveillance, the assimilation of such data into models of pathogen spread, and the increasing contribution of models to public health practice. We next consider emerging paradigms in causal inference for infectious diseases, ranging from approaches to evaluating vaccines and antimicrobial therapies to the task of ascribing clinical syndromes to etiologic microorganisms, an age-old problem transformed by our increasing ability to characterize human-associated microbiota.

These children require safe and secure trauma‐informed therapeutic care. However, the children's residential care workforce delivering this vital care is an unrepresented, under‐researched and largely unsupported professional group. The workforce undertakes physically and emotionally challenging work in difficult conditions, exacerbated by the COVID‐19 pandemic. Practitioner wellbeing is directly associated with outcomes for children. Therefore, we sought to understand how experiences within the workforce could improve overall working conditions, and thus outcomes for staff and children. Thirty participants took part in a survey, providing feedback on their experiences and the situations they faced during the English lockdown April‐June 2020. Two participants also opted to take part in a teleconference interview, rather than survey, although were asked the same questions. Data were analysed through thematic analysis. A stakeholder advisory board supported the project, including frontline staff, care leavers, service managers and policy researchers. The advisory board assisted in reflecting on the data from the survey and interviews to generate a complete analysis. Overall, staff require facilitated safe spaces for peer‐support, reflective and emotionally supportive supervision. An organisational awareness that staff wellbeing is intrinsically connected to the wellbeing and therapeutic outcomes of the children they care for is essential. Further, staff require a sense of belongingness to feel safe and competent in their role due to a lack of external recognition and professional representation or validation. Based on the findings of the study and an iterative process with the stakeholder advisory board, we created a Wellbeing Charter for adoption within organisations to promote and protect the wellbeing of this vital workforce.

Research efforts are being carried out to curtail the disease from spreading as it has been declared as of global health emergency. Hence, there is an exigent need to identify and design drugs that are capable of curing the infection and hinder its continual spread across the globe. Herein, a computer-aided drug design tool known as the virtual screening method was used to screen a database of 44 million compounds to find compounds that have the potential to inhibit the surface glycoprotein responsible for virus entry and binding. The consensus scoring approach selected three compounds with promising physicochemical properties and favorable molecular interactions with the target protein. These selected compounds can undergo lead optimization to be further developed as drugs that can be used in treating the COVID-19 disease.","Onawole, Abdulmujeeb T.; Sulaiman, Kazeem O.; Kolapo, Temitope U.; Akinde, Fatimo O.; Adegoke, Rukayat O.",Virus Res,32,20

Adrenal insufficiency (AI) is supposed to be associated with an increased infection risk which could trigger an adrenal crisis. OBJECTIVE: Our primary aim was to evaluate the incidence of COVID-19 symptoms and complications in AI patients. DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a retrospective case-control study. All patients were on active follow-up and lived in Lombardy, one of the most affected areas. PATIENTS: We enrolled 279 patients with primary and secondary AI and 112 controls (patients with benign pituitary lesions without hormonal alterations). All AI patients had been previously trained to modify their replacement therapy on stress doses. INTERVENTION: By administering a standardized questionnaire by phone, we collected data on COVID-19 suggestive symptoms and consequences. RESULTS: In February-April 2020, the prevalence of symptomatic patients (complaining at least one symptom of viral infection) was similar between the two groups (24% in AI and 22.3% in controls, p 0.79). Highly suggestive COVID-19 symptoms (at least two including fever and/or cough) also occurred equally in AI and controls (12.5% in both groups). No patient required hospitalization and no adrenal crisis was reported. Few nasopharyngeal swabs were performed (n=12) as indicated by sanitary regulations, limiting conclusions on the exact infection rate (two positive results in AI and none in controls, p 0.52). CONCLUSIONS: AI patients who are adequately treated and trained, seem to display the same incidence of COVID-19 suggestive symptoms and disease severity as controls.","Carosi, Giulia; Morelli, Valentina; Del Sindaco, Giulia; Serban, Andreea Liliana; Cremaschi, Arianna; Frigerio, Sofia; Rodari, Giulia; Profka, Eriselda; Indirli, Rita; Mungari, Roberta; Resi, Veronica; Orsi, Emanuela; Ferrante, Emanuele; Dolci, Alessia; Giavoli, Claudia; Arosio, Maura; Mantovani, Prof Giovanna",J Clin Endocrinol Metab,32,1

Most of studies have focused on molecular and pathogenic characterization of PEDV, whereas there were limited studies in understanding the role of gut microbiota (GM) in viral-associated diarrhea. Here, using the Illumina MiSeq platform, we examined and compared the impact of PEDV infection on the GM of sows and their piglets less than 10 days old. Our results showed that PEDV caused alternations in the structure and abundance of GM from levels of phylum to genus, and even species. For sows, a significant decrease of observed species was found in diarrheal sows than that in healthy sows (p < 0.05). The unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances also revealed considerable segregations of GM structure among healthy, asymptomatic, and diarrheal sows. For piglets, Bacteroidetes, the dominant bacteria in healthy piglets, were replaced by Firmicutes in asymptomatic and diarrheal piglets. The abundances of Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria were also remarkably increased in asymptomatic piglets and diarrheal piglets when compared to those of the healthy piglets. Our findings demonstrated that PEDV infection caused severe perturbations of GM, reduced probiotic bacteria, and enriched pathogenic bacteria.","Song, Deping; Peng, Qi; Chen, Yanjun; Zhou, Xinrong; Zhang, Fanfan; Li, Anqi; Huang, Dongyan; Wu, Qiong; Ye, Yu; He, Houjun; Wang, Leyi; Tang, Yuxin",Sci Rep,32,22

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using data on adults hospitalized with COVID-19 from the electronic health record from 52 health systems across the United States contributing data to Cerner Real World Data(TM). In-hospital mortality was evaluated by race first in unadjusted analysis then sequentially adjusting for demographics and clinical characteristics using logistic regression. RESULTS: Through August 2020, 19,584 patients with median age 52 years were hospitalized with COVID-19, including n = 4,215 (21.5%) Black and n = 5,761 (29.4%) Hispanic patients. Relative to white patients, crude mortality was slightly higher in Black adults [22.7% vs 20.8%, unadjusted OR 1.12 (95% CI 1.02–1.22)]. Mortality remained higher among Black adults after adjusting for demographic factors including age, sex, date, region, and insurance status (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01–1.27), but not after including comorbidities and body mass index (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.93–1.23). Compared with non-Hispanic patients, Hispanic patients had lower mortality both in unadjusted and adjusted models [mortality 12.7 vs 25.0%, unadjusted OR 0.44(95% CI 0.40–0.48), fully adjusted OR 0.71 (95% CI 0.59–0.86)]. DISCUSSION: In this large, multicenter, EHR-based analysis, Black adults hospitalized with COVID-19 had higher observed mortality than white patients due to a higher burden of comorbidities in Black adults. In contrast, Hispanic ethnicity was associated with lower mortality, even in fully adjusted models.","Navar, Ann M.; Purinton, Stacey N.; Hou, Qingjiang; Taylor, Robert J.; Peterson, Eric D.",PLoS One,32,16

Other prominent features of AIR include visual field deficits and photoreceptor dysfunction in the setting of progressive unexplained vision loss. The role of inflammation is poorly understood in AIR. Since cytokines play a central role in the initiation and development of inflammation, we evaluated the presence of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in AIR patient sera. We demonstrate that IL-6 and CXCL9 are both elevated in AIR patient sera. Moreover, the presence and concentration of these 2 molecules appear to correlate with AIR patient disease severity. This cytokine profile, IL-6 and CXCL9, has been described to participate in a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Our study provides support for an activated inflammatory process in AIR and identifies possible mechanisms that can drive autoimmunity in this disease.","Detrick, Barbara; Gangaputra, Sapna; Palsgrove, Doreen N.; Heaney, Christopher D.; Hooks, John J.; Nida Sen, H.",Journal of Neuroimmunology,32,1

Understanding the genomic structure and function of PEDV and the influence of the viral components on innate immunity is essential for developing effective vaccines. In the current review, we systematically describe the recent developments in vaccine against PEDV and the roles of structural proteins, non-structural proteins and accessory proteins of PEDV in affecting viral virulence and regulating innate immunity, which will provide insight into the rational design of effective and safe vaccines for PEDV or other coronaviruses.","Li, Zhiwei; Ma, Zhiqian; Li, Yang; Gao, Sheng; Xiao, Shuqi",Microb Pathog,32,30

However, our understanding of kidney injury caused by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited. This study aimed to explore the association between kidney injury and disease progression in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was designed by including 2630 patients with confirmed COVID-19 from Huoshenshan Hospital (Wuhan, China) from 1 February to 13 April 2020. Kidney function indexes and other clinical information were extracted from the electronic medical record system. Associations between kidney function indexes and disease progression were analyzed using Cox proportional-hazards regression and generalized linear mixed model. RESULTS: We found that estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and creatinine clearance (Ccr) decreased in 22.0% and 24.0% of patients with COVID-19, respectively. Proteinuria was detected in 15.0% patients and hematuria was detected in 8.1% of patients. Hematuria (HR 2.38, 95% CI 1.50–3.78), proteinuria (HR 2.16, 95% CI 1.33–3.51), elevated baseline serum creatinine (HR 2.84, 95% CI 1.92–4.21) and blood urea nitrogen (HR 3.54, 95% CI 2.36–5.31), and decrease baseline eGFR (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.07–2.34) were found to be independent risk factors for disease progression after adjusted confounders. Generalized linear mixed model analysis showed that the dynamic trajectories of uric acid was significantly related to disease progression. CONCLUSION: There was a high proportion of early kidney function injury in COVID-19 patients on admission. Early kidney injury could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs primarily with droplets through coughing and sneezing, is also occurs through inhalation of aerosolized secretions, which travel, remain suspended in the air longer. Since early in the outbreak, have described COVID-19 cases in healthcare workers (HCWs). In the early stages of the disease, there may be asymptomatic. This may lead to incorrect diagnosis or delayed diagnosis and may lead to the nosocomial spread of the virus. One of the most important causes of transmission among HCWs is an aerosolized virus in a closed environment for a long time. It is possible to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals with outpatient treatment and triage. Infection control measures, including wearing surgical masks, hand hygiene, and social distance, are considered essential in preventing human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2. Immediate response and practices of infection control measures are critical for saving lives during an epidemic inside and outside the hospital. Analyzing current knowledge about the features of SARS-CoV-2 infection, screening, personal protection protocols, triage and psychological support practices for healthcare professionals can be promising in terms of controlling the infection.","Kalin Ünüvar, Gamze; Doğanay, Mehmet; Alp, Emine",Turkish journal of medical sciences,32,16

In addition to being the most accurate long-range COVID predictor so far developed, it captures the observed periodicity in daily reported numbers. Its effectiveness is based on three design features: (1) producing different model parameters to predict the number of COVID deaths (and cases) from each time and for a given number of weeks into the future, (2) systematically searching over the available covariates and their historical values to find an effective combination, and (3) training the model using “last-fold partitioning”, where each proposed model is validated on only the last instance of the training dataset, rather than being cross-validated.

Workers were evaluated on July 20-24 (2020), and again after three weeks. At each encounter, clinical data were obtained, and a blood sample was taken by finger pricking for antibody detection (Standard Q COVID-19 IgM/IgG Duo-Biosensor, South Korea). RESULTS Participants (n=1,163) were mostly female (66.6%), and median age was 38 years-old. Close contact with COVID-19 was reported by 82.3%. In the first phase of study, a total of 5.5% (n=64) were found to have antibodies against COVID-19 (26 IgM; 19 IgG; 19 both), including 34.6% (n=27) of workers previously diagnosed with COVID-19 (n=78).

Identifying asymptomatic individuals early through serial testing is recommended to control COVID-19 in nursing homes, both in response to an outbreak (“outbreak testing” of residents and healthcare personnel) and in facilities without outbreaks (“non-outbreak testing” of healthcare personnel). The effectiveness of outbreak testing and isolation with or without non-outbreak testing was evaluated. METHODS: Using published SARS-CoV-2 transmission parameters, the fraction of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions prevented through serial testing (weekly, every three days, or daily) and isolation of asymptomatic persons compared to symptom-based testing and isolation was evaluated through mathematical modeling using a Reed-Frost model to estimate the percentage of cases prevented (i.e., “effectiveness”) through either outbreak testing alone or outbreak plus non-outbreak testing. The potential effect of simultaneous decreases (by 10%) in the effectiveness of isolating infected individuals when instituting testing strategies was also evaluated. RESULTS: Modeling suggests that outbreak testing could prevent 54% (weekly testing with 48-hour test turnaround) to 92% (daily testing with immediate results and 50% relative sensitivity) of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Adding non-outbreak testing could prevent up to an additional 8% of SARS-CoV-2 infections (depending on test frequency and turnaround time). However, added benefits of non-outbreak testing were mostly negated if accompanied by decreases in infection control practice. CONCLUSIONS: When combined with high-quality infection control practices, outbreak testing could be an effective approach to preventing COVID-19 in nursing homes, particularly if optimized through increased test frequency and use of tests with rapid turnaround.","See, Isaac; Paul, Prabasaj; Slayton, Rachel B; Steele, Molly K; Stuckey, Matthew J; Duca, Lindsey; Srinivasan, Arjun; Stone, Nimalie; Jernigan, John A; Reddy, Sujan C",Clin Infect Dis,32,1

Although 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) vaccination programs have decreased the incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia, PCV13 failed to prevent serotype 3 pneumococcal disease as effectively as other vaccine serotypes. We aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the co-pathogenesis of influenza virus and serotype 3 pneumococci. METHODS: We carried out a genome-wide screening of a serotype 3 S. pneumoniae transposon insertion mutant library in a mouse model of coinfection with influenza A virus (IAV) to identify the bacterial factors required for this synergism. RESULTS: Direct, high-throughput sequencing of transposon insertion sites identified 24 genes required for both coinfection and bacterial infection alone. Targeted deletion of the putative aminotransferase (PA) gene decreased bacterial growth, which was restored by supplementation with methionine. The bacterial burden in a coinfection with the PA gene deletion mutant and IAV in the lung was lower than that in a coinfection with wild-type pneumococcus and IAV, but was significantly higher than that in an infection with the PA gene deletion mutant alone. These data suggest that IAV infection alters host metabolism to benefit pneumococcal fitness and confer higher susceptibility to pneumococcal infection. We further demonstrated that bacterial growth was increased by supplementation with methionine or IAV-infected mouse lung homogenates. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicates that modulation of host metabolism during IAV infection may serve as a potential therapeutic intervention against secondary bacterial infections caused by serotype 3 pneumococci during IAV outbreaks in the future.

Due to their devastating impacts on the world, distinguishing between real and deepfake videos has become a fundamental issue. This paper presents a new deepfake detection method: you only look once–convolutional neural network–extreme gradient boosting (YOLO-CNN-XGBoost). The YOLO face detector is employed to extract the face area from video frames, while the InceptionResNetV2 CNN is utilized to extract features from these faces. These features are fed into the XGBoost that works as a recognizer on the top level of the CNN network. The proposed method achieves 90.62% of an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 90.73% accuracy, 93.53% specificity, 85.39% sensitivity, 85.39% recall, 87.36% precision, and 86.36% F1-measure on the CelebDF-FaceForencics++ (c23) merged dataset.

Therefore, this survey was conducted to investigate the prevalence and related factors of depressive, anxiety, acute stress, and insomnia symptoms in medical staffs in Kashi, Xinjiang, China during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among medical staffs working in First People's Hospital of Kashi, Xinjiang. The questionnaire collected demographic data and self-design questions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Impact of Events Scale-6, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7, the Perceived Social Support Scale, the Chinese Big Five Personality Inventory-15, and the Trait Coping Style Questionnaire were used to measure psychological symptoms or characteristics. Binary logistic regression was carried out to examine the associations between socio-demographic factors and symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia. In total, data from 123 participants were finally included, among which the prevalence rate of depressive, anxiety, acute stress, and insomnia symptoms is 60.2, 49.6, 43.1, and 41.1%, respectively. The regression model revealed that minority ethnicity, being worried about infection, spending more time on following pandemic information, and neurotic personality were positively associated with the mental health symptoms, while extraversion personality, higher education level, and better social support were negatively associated. In our study, the prevalence of mental health impact was high among medical staffs in Kashi, China who experienced the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Several factors were found to be associated with mental health conditions. These findings could help identify medical staffs at risk for mental health problems and be helpful for making precise mental health intervention policies during the resurgence. Our study may pave way for more research into Xinjiang during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhao, Yongzhi; Guo, Junlong; Liu, Shuai; Aizezi, Muyeseer; Zeng, Qiong; Sidike, Ashenggu; Abliz, Raziya; Kudireti, Aisikaerjiang; Xie, Yan; Taineikuli, Atikan; Zhang, Bin",Front Public Health,32,14

This study documented the prevalence of clinical cases of insomnia, anxiety, and depression and selected risk factors (COVID-19, confinement, financial burden, social isolation) during the first wave of the pandemic in 13 countries throughout the world. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: International, multi-center, harmonized survey of 22 330 adults (mean age = 41.9 years old, range 18–95; 65.6% women) from the general population in 13 countries and four continents. Participants were invited to complete a standardized web-based survey about sleep and psychological symptoms during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic from May to August 2020. RESULTS: Clinical insomnia symptoms were reported by 36.7% (95% CI, 36.0–37.4) of respondents and 17.4% (95% CI, 16.9–17.9) met criteria for a probable insomnia disorder. There were 25.6% (95% CI, 25.0–26.2) with probable anxiety and 23.1% (95% CI, 22.5–23.6) with probable depression. Rates of insomnia symptoms (>40%) and insomnia disorder (>25%) were significantly higher in women, younger age groups, and in residents of Brazil, Canada, Norway, Poland, USA, and United Kingdom compared to residents from Asian countries (China and Japan, 8% for disorder and 22%–25% for symptoms) (all Ps < 0.01). Proportions of insomnia cases were significantly higher among participants who completed the survey earlier in the first wave of the pandemic relative to those who completed it later. Risks of insomnia were higher among participants who reported having had COVID-19, who reported greater financial burden, were in confinement for a period of four to five weeks, and living alone or with more than five people in same household. These associations remained significant after controlling for age, sex, and psychological symptoms. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Insomnia, anxiety, and depression were very prevalent during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health prevention programs are needed to prevent chronicity and reduce long-term adverse outcomes associated with chronic insomnia and mental health problems.","Morin, Charles M.; Bjorvatn, Bjørn; Chung, Frances; Holzinger, Brigitte; Partinen, Markku; Penzel, Thomas; Ivers, Hans; Wing, Yun Kwok; Chan, Ngan Yin; Merikanto, Ilona; Mota-Rolim, Sergio; Macêdo, Tainá; De Gennaro, Luigi; Léger, Damien; Dauvilliers, Yves; Plazzi, Giuseppe; Nadorff, Michael R.; Bolstad, Courtney J.; Sieminski, Mariusz; Benedict, Christian; Cedernaes, Jonathan; Inoue, Yuchi; Han, Fang; Espie, Colin A.",Sleep Med,32,16

This is due to the vulnerability of health and economic systems, coupled with the high burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB), and malaria. Here we examine the potential implications of COVID-19 on the control of these major epidemic diseases in Africa. We use current evidence on disease burden of HIV, TB, and malaria, and epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 in Africa, retrieved from the literature. Our analysis shows that the current measures to control COVID-19 neglect important and complex context-specific epidemiological, social, and economic realities in Africa. There is a similarity of clinical features of TB and malaria, with those used to track COVID-19 cases. This coupled with institutional mistrust and misinformation might result in many patients with clinical features similar to those of COVID-19 being hesitant to voluntarily seek care in a formal health facility. Furthermore, most people in productive age in Africa work in the informal sector, and most of those in the formal sector are underemployed. With the current measures to control COVID-19, these populations might face unprecedented difficulties to access essential services, mainly due to reduced ability of patients to support direct and indirect medical costs, and unavailability of transportation means to reach health facilities. Therefore, if not accompanied with appropriate economic and epidemiological considerations, we anticipate that these measures might result in unprecedented difficulties among vulnerable segments of society to access essential services, including antiretroviral and prophylactic drugs among people living with HIV and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, anti-tuberculosis drugs, and curative and preventive treatments for malaria among pregnant women and children. This might increase the propensity of patients taking substandard doses and/or medicines, which has the potential to compromise drug efficacy, and worsen health inequalities in the region. COVID-19 responses at country level should include measures to protect vulnerable and under-served segments of society.","Amimo, Floriano; Lambert, Ben; Magit, Anthony",Trop Med Health,32,10

In Austria, the largest health insurance fund covers 7 million people and has 12,000 employees, including 3700 healthcare workers (HCW). For patient and staff safety, transmission control measures were implemented and mass testing of employees for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was conducted. An IgG SARS-CoV-2 rapid test on fingerstick blood was used as a screening test (ST), followed by serologic studies with 3 different immunoassays and confirmatory testing by a neutralization test (NT). Among 7858 employees, 144 had a positive ST and 88 were confirmed by a NT (1.12%, CI: 0.9–1.38%). The positive predictive value (PPV) of the ST was 69.3% (CI: 60.5–77.2). Interestingly, 40% of the NT positive serum samples were tested negative in all 3 immunoassays. Of the total sample, 2242 HCW (28.5%) were identified. Unexpectedly, there was no difference in the prevalence of NT positives in HCW compared to non-HCW (23/2242 vs. 65/5301, p = 0.53). SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence was not increased among HCW. Although HCW are at potentially increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, transmission control measures in healthcare facilities appear sufficient to limit transmission of infection.","Bartko, Johann; Zehetmayer, Sonja; Weseslindtner, Lukas; Stiasny, Karin; Schloegl, Andrea; Forjan, Ernst; Zwettler, Elisabeth; Krauter, Andreas; Keil, Felix; Sédille-Mostafaie, Nazanin",J Clin Med,32,9

SYK is also a key modulator of pathways involved in thrombosis formation. Fostamatinib is FDA-approved for chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and has been evaluated in over 4000 patients for treatment of allergic, autoimmune, and neoplastic disorders. Fostamatinib is well tolerated, with a consistent safety profile across a number of diseases. In rheumatoid arthritis patients, fostamatinib reduced the plasma levels of IL-6.1 The active metabolite (R406) was protective in mouse models of LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI)2 and LPS- or antibody-induced acute kidney injury (AKI).3 SYK inhibition decreased the incidence of thrombosis in mouse models of thromboembolism,4 and the incidence of thromboembolic events was decreased in patients treated with fostamatinib compared with other treatments for ITP. These immunomodulatory effects suggest that SYK inhibition represents a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of COVID-19, which led to design of a clinical study of fostamatinib in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients are at risk for a potentially fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cytokine storm, severe systemic capillary leak syndrome, thromboembolic events, and multi-organ dysfunction/failure. SYK is a master regulator of signal transduction pathways implicated in these COVID-19 associated complications, which involves hyperactivation of both innate and acquired immune systems. Targeting SYK could prevent the cytokine storm, downstream activation of endothelial cells and platelets, and influx of neutrophils and monocytes into lungs or kidney leading to ALI and AKI, respectively. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, Phase 3 study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of fostamatinib in adult, hospitalized, high-risk COVID-19 patients. Patients will be treated with fostamatinib 150mg BID for up to 28 days plus standard of care. Improvement in clinical status will be assessed using the 8-point ordinal scale. References 1.

This study examines whether CEA study volume is proportionate to the burden associated with 21 major disease categories. METHODS: We searched the Tufts Medical Center CEA and Global Health CEA Registries for studies published between 2010 and 2019 that measured cost per quality-adjusted life-year or cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY). Stratified by geographical region and country income level, the relationship between literature volume and disease burden (as measured by 2019 Global Burden of Disease estimates of population DALYs) was analysed using ordinary least squares linear regression. Additionally, the number of CEAs per intervention deemed ‘essential’ for universal health coverage by the Disease Control Priorities Network was assessed to evaluate how many interventions are supported by cost-effectiveness evidence. RESULTS: The results located below the regression line but with relatively high burden suggested disease areas that were ‘understudied’ compared with expected study volume. Understudied disease areas varied by region. Higher-income and upper-middle-income country (HUMIC) CEA volume for non-communicable diseases (eg, mental/behavioural disorders) was 100-fold higher than that in low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LLMICs). LLMIC study volume remained concentrated in HIV/AIDS as well as other communicable and neglected tropical diseases. Across 60 essential interventions, only 33 had any supporting CEA evidence, and only 21 had a decision context involving a low-income or middle-income country. With the exception of one intervention, available CEA evidence revealed the 21 interventions to be cost-effective, with base-case findings less than three times the GDP per capita. CONCLUSION: Our analysis highlights disease areas that require significant policy attention. Research gaps for highly prevalent, lethal or disabling diseases, as well as essential interventions may be stifling potential efficiency gains. Large research disparities between HUMICs and LLMICs suggest funding opportunities for improving allocative efficiency in LLMIC health systems.","Do, Lauren A; Synnott, Patricia G; Ma, Siyu; Ollendorf, Daniel A",BMJ Glob Health,32,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Papers were retrieved from a PubMed search, using different combinations of keywords [e.g., pain treatment AND COVID-19 AND drug-drug interaction (DDI)], without limitations in terms of publication date and language. RESULTS: Remdesivir is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase the plasma concentration of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., fentanyl). Dexamethasone is an inducer of CYP3A4 and glycoprotein P, thus coadministration with drugs metabolized by this isoform will lead to their increased clearance. Dexamethasone may cause hypokalemia, thus potentiating the risk of ventricular arrhythmias if it is given with opioids able to prolong the QT interval, such as oxycodone and methadone. Finally, the existing differences among opioids with regard to their impact on immune responses should also be taken into account with only tapentadol and hydromorphone appearing neutral on both cytokine production and immune parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should keep in mind the frequent DDIs with drugs extensively metabolized by the CYP450 system and prefer opioids undergoing a limited hepatic metabolism. Identification and management of DDIs and dissemination of the related knowledge should be a major goal in the delivery of chronic care to ensure optimized patient outcomes and facilitate updating recommendations for COVID-19 therapy in frail populations, namely comorbid, poly-medicated patients or individuals suffering from substance use disorder.","Natoli, S; Carpenedo, R; Chinè, E; Vannicola, F; Leonardis, F; Dauri, M",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,32,24

Knowledge, attitudes, and practices on personal hygiene and social distancing as well as psychological impact of COVID‐19 were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed to determine differences in well‐being and compliance to social distancing measures between respondents with and without self‐reported IBS. Factors associated with improvement or worsening of IBS symptoms were evaluated. RESULTS: Out of 2704 respondents, 2024 (74.9%) did not have IBS, 305 (11.3%) had self‐reported IBS, and 374 (13.8%) did not know what IBS was. Self‐reported IBS respondents reported significantly worse emotional, social, and psychological well‐being compared with non‐IBS respondents and were less compliant to social distancing measures (28.2% vs 35.3%, P = 0.029); 61.6% reported no change, 26.6% reported improvement, and 11.8% reported worsening IBS symptoms.

According to WHO estimations, 600 million cases of diseases caused by contaminated food were noted in 2010, including almost 350 million caused by pathogenic bacteria. Campylobacter, Salmonella, as well as Yersinia enterocolitica and Listeria monocytogenes may dwell in livestock (poultry, cattle, and swine) but are also found in wild animals, pets, fish, and rodents. Animals, often being asymptomatic carriers of pathogens, excrete them with faeces, thus delivering them to the environment. Therefore, pathogens may invade new individuals, as well as reside on vegetables and fruits. Pathogenic bacteria also penetrate food production areas and may remain there in the form of a biofilm covering the surfaces of machines and equipment. A common occurrence of microbes in food products, as well as their improper or careless processing, leads to common poisonings. Symptoms of foodborne infections may be mild, sometimes flu-like, but they also may be accompanied by severe complications, some even fatal.

Although this zoonosis is generally not considered as fatal, the pathogen can eventually cause severe infection with septic shock, multi-organ failure and lethal pulmonary hemorrhages leading to mortality. In this study, we have performed a proteomic analysis of serum samples from leptospirosis patients (n = 6), febrile controls (falciparum malaria) (n = 8) and healthy subjects (n = 18) to obtain an insight about disease pathogenesis and host immune responses in leptospiral infections. 2DE and 2D-DIGE analysis in combination with MALDI-TOF/TOF MS revealed differential expression of 22 serum proteins in leptospirosis patients compared to the healthy controls. Among the identified differentially expressed proteins, 8 candidates exhibited different trends compared to the febrile controls. Functional analysis suggested the involvement of differentially expressed proteins in vital physiological pathways, including acute phase response, complement and coagulation cascades and hemostasis. This is the first report of analysis of human serum proteome alterations in leptospirosis patients, which revealed several differentially expressed proteins, including α-1-antitrypsin, vitronectin, ceruloplasmin, G-protein signaling regulator, apolipoprotein A-IV, which have not been reported in context of leptospirosis previously.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated online search behavior related to the COVID-19 outbreak and the attitudes of “infodemic monikers” (ie, erroneous information that gives rise to interpretative mistakes, fake news, episodes of racism, etc) circulating in Italy. METHODS: By using Google Trends to explore the internet search activity related to COVID-19 from January to March 2020, article titles from the most read newspapers and government websites were mined to investigate the attitudes of infodemic monikers circulating across various regions and cities in Italy. Search volume values and average peak comparison (APC) values were used to analyze the results. RESULTS: Keywords such as “novel coronavirus,” “China coronavirus,” “COVID-19,” “2019-nCOV,” and “SARS-COV-2” were the top infodemic and scientific COVID-19 terms trending in Italy. The top five searches related to health were “face masks,” “amuchina” (disinfectant), “symptoms of the novel coronavirus,” “health bulletin,” and “vaccines for coronavirus.” The regions of Umbria and Basilicata recorded a high number of infodemic monikers (APC weighted total >140). Misinformation was widely circulated in the Campania region, and racism-related information was widespread in Umbria and Basilicata. These monikers were frequently searched (APC weighted total >100) in more than 10 major cities in Italy, including Rome. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a growing regional and population-level interest in COVID-19 in Italy. The majority of searches were related to amuchina, face masks, health bulletins, and COVID-19 symptoms. Since a large number of infodemic monikers were observed across Italy, we recommend that health agencies use Google Trends to predict human behavior as well as to manage misinformation circulation in Italy.","Rovetta, Alessandro; Bhagavathula, Akshaya Srikanth",JMIR Public Health Surveill,32,20

However, the possible risk factors for myocardial damage in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) are not fully known. METHODS AND RESULTS: Critical type patients were selected randomly from 204 confirmed COVID‐19 cases occurring in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from February 1, 2020 to February 24, 2020. Univariate analyses were used to compare the 2 groups: the myocardial damage group and the non–myocardial damage group. A total of 82 critical patients with COVID‐19 were recruited: 34 with myocardial damage and 48 without myocardial damage. A total of 30 patients died in the myocardial damage group, and 20 died in the non–myocardial damage group. In univariate analysis, the proportion of elderly patients (>70 years old, 70.59% versus 37.50%; P=0.003) and patients with cardiovascular disease (41.18% versus 12.50%; P=0.003) was higher among myocardial damage patients than among non–myocardial damage patients. Multivariate analysis showed that age >70 years old (hazard ratio [HR], 2.44; 95% CI, 1.01–5.40), CRP (C‐reactive protein) >100 mg/L (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 0.94–3.92), lactate dehydrogenase >300 U/L (HR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.03–6.90), and lactic acid >3 mmol/L (HR, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.57–6.75) were independent risk factors for myocardial damage in patients with COVID‐19. CONCLUSIONS: Old age (>70 years old), CRP >100 mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase >300 U/L, and lactic acid >3 mmol/L are high‐risk factors related to myocardial damage in critical patients with COVID‐19.","Li, Lingzhi; Zhang, Shudi; He, Bing; Chen, Xiaobei; Zhao, Qingyan",J Am Heart Assoc,32,1

The developing picture in Italy, of acute hospitals becoming overwhelmed with treating patients suffering with severe and life-threatening symptoms from the disease, prompted the orthopaedic surgeons to formulate a plan to transfer trauma patients requiring surgery to the elective hospital to unburden the acute hospital system. METHODS: Under the threat of this pandemic; protocols and algorithms were established for referral, acceptance and care of trauma patients from acute hospitals in the region. Each day, as new guidance on COVID-19 emerged, our process and algorithms were adjusted to reflect pertinent change. RESULTS: The screening of all patients referred, worked well in keeping our hospital “COVID-free” with respect to patients undergoing operations. An upward trend in cases referred reflected the decreased capacity in the acute hospitals due to rising cases of COVID-19 within the hospital network. During the first 7 weeks of the pandemic 308 operations were performed, (31.1% upper limb, 33.4% lower limb, 4.1% spine, 14.1% urgent elective, 17.4% plastic surgery cases). Regular review and audit of the activity in the hospital as well as communication with the referring teams enabled appropriate planning to accommodate the increase in case-mix as the need arose. DISCUSSION: This paper details the steps that were taken in planning for such a change in management specific to the orthopaedic surgery setting and the lessons learnt during this process. The success of the development of this pathway was facilitated by clear communication channels, flexibility to adapt to changing process and feedback from all stakeholders. The implementation of this pathway allowed the unburdening of acute hospitals dealing with the pandemic that was steadily reducing access to operating theatres and anaesthetic resources.","Gibbons, John P.; Forman, Siobhan; Keogh, Peter; Curtin, Paul; Kiely, Ruth; O'Leary, Geraldine; Skerritt, Conor; O'Sullivan, Kathy; Synnott, Keith; Cashman, James P.; O'Byrne, John M.",Surgeon,32,4

The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is targeting the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and mostly causes a respiratory illness. Although acquired and resistance immunity is one of the most important aspects of alleviating the trend of the current pandemic; however, there is still a big gap of knowledge regarding the infection process, immunopathogenesis, recovery, and reinfection. AIM OF REVIEW: To answer the questions regarding “the potential and probability of reinfection in COVID-19 infected cases” or “the efficiency and duration of SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced immunity against reinfection” we critically evaluated the current reports on SARS-CoV-2 immunity and reinfection with special emphasis on comparative studies using animal models that generalize their finding about protection and reinfection. Also, the contribution of humoral immunity in the process of COVID-19 recovery and the role of ACE2 in virus infectivity and pathogenesis has been discussed. Furthermore, innate and cellular immunity and inflammatory responses in the disease and recovery conditions are reviewed and an overall outline of immunologic aspects of COVID-19 progression and recovery in three different stages are presented. Finally, we categorized the infected cases into four different groups based on the acquired immunity and the potential for reinfection. KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF REVIEW: In this review paper, we proposed a new strategy to predict the potential of reinfection in each identified category. This classification may help to distribute resources more meticulously to determine: who needs to be serologically tested for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, what percentage of the population is immune to the virus, and who needs to be vaccinated.","Khoshkam, Zahra; Aftabi, Younes; Stenvinkel, Peter; Paige Lawrence, B.; Rezaei, Mehran Habibi; Ichihara, Gaku; Fereidouni, Sasan",J Adv Res,32,20

Several risk assessment tools, including individual vulnerability to COVID-19, have been developed. The present study aimed to characterize a high-risk population using such a tool and examine risk factors and nutritional status in the national survey data and estimate the region-specific population size. METHODS: The study included 17,540 Korean adults who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). The risk scores for individual vulnerability to COVID-19 were calculated based on age, sex, smoking status, and comorbidities, and a high-risk population was defined as having risk scores ≥11. Nutritional status was compared between the high-risk population and the remaining participants in the KNHANES data. The region-specific population size was estimated using national statistics. RESULTS: The proportion of the high-risk population was estimated to be 10.5%, which corresponds to approximately 4.6 million adults in South Korea. About 20% of them had inadequate intake of all of vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, and C below the estimated average requirement. The high-risk population showed 1.65 [95% confidence interval: 1.39, 1.96] higher odds of inadequate intake of multiple vitamins than the remaining participants. In the ecological analysis, the region-specific numbers of the high-risk population correlated significantly with the actual numbers of deaths due to COVID-19 (P value = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that individuals vulnerable to COVID-19, in particular those are living in densely populated regions, should pay particular attention to the protection against this pandemic and have adequate nutritional status, which may support optimal immune function.","Baik, Inkyung",Clin Nutr,32,5

Physical, chemical, and biological processes result in plastic weathering, with eventual formation of debris in the micro to nano size range. There is an increasing awareness that plastic fragments are dispersed in the air and can be inhaled by humans, which may cause adverse effects on the respiratory system and on other systems. Urban environments are often characterized by high concentrations of fine airborne dust from various sources. To date, however, there is limited information on the distribution, shape, and size of microplastics in the air in urban and other environments. In this article, we review and discuss our current understanding of the exposure characteristics of airborne plastic debris in urbanized areas, focusing on concentration, size, morphology, presence of additives and distributions of different polymers. The natural and extend data are compiled and compared to laboratory-based analyses to further our understanding of the potential adverse effects of inhaled plastic particles on human health.","Amato-Lourenço, Luís Fernando; dos Santos Galvão, Luciana; de Weger, Letty A.; Hiemstra, Pieter S.; Vijver, Martina G.; Mauad, Thais",Sci Total Environ,32,28

Many vaccines are being deployed to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) including two novel mRNA-based vaccines1,2. These vaccines elicit neutralizing antibodies and appear to be safe and effective, but the precise nature of the elicited antibodies is not known3–6. Here we report on the antibody and memory B cell responses in a cohort of 20 volunteers who received either the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccines. Consistent with prior reports, 8 weeks after the second vaccine injection volunteers showed high levels of IgM, and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) and receptor binding domain (RBD) binding titers3,5,6. Moreover, the plasma neutralizing activity, and the relative numbers of RBD-specific memory B cells were equivalent to individuals who recovered from natural infection7,8. However, activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants encoding E484K or N501Y or the K417N:E484K:N501Y combination was reduced by a small but significant margin. Consistent with these findings, vaccine-elicited monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2, targeting a number of different RBD epitopes in common with mAbs isolated from infected donors. Structural analyses of mAbs complexed with S trimer suggest that vaccine- and virus-encoded S adopts similar conformations to induce equivalent anti-RBD antibodies. However, neutralization by 14 of the 17 most potent mAbs tested was reduced or abolished by either K417N, or E484K, or N501Y mutations. Notably, the same mutations were selected when recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)/SARS-CoV-2 S was cultured in the presence of the vaccine elicited mAbs. Taken together the results suggest that the monoclonal antibodies in clinical use should be tested against newly arising variants, and that mRNA vaccines may need to be updated periodically to avoid potential loss of clinical efficacy.","Wang, Zijun; Schmidt, Fabian; Weisblum, Yiska; Muecksch, Frauke; Barnes, Christopher O.; Finkin, Shlomo; Schaefer-Babajew, Dennis; Cipolla, Melissa; Gaebler, Christian; Lieberman, Jenna A.; Oliveira, Thiago Y.; Yang, Zhi; Abernathy, Morgan E.; Huey-Tubman, Kathryn E.; Hurley, Arlene; Turroja, Martina; West, Kamille A.; Gordon, Kristie; Millard, Katrina G.; Ramos, Victor; Da Silva, Justin; Xu, Jianliang; Colbert, Robert A.; Patel, Roshni; Dizon, Juan; Unson-O’Brien, Cecille; Shimeliovich, Irina; Gazumyan, Anna; Caskey, Marina; Bjorkman, Pamela J.; Casellas, Rafael; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Bieniasz, Paul D.; Nussenzweig, Michel C.",bioRxiv,32,16

However, the available data are limited, inconsistent and conflicting. Besides, no randomised controlled trial exists in this regard. Hence, the present meta-analysis was conducted to provide an updated summary and collate the effect of statin use on clinical outcomes in COVID-19 using unadjusted and adjusted risk estimates. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases were systematically searched using appropriate keywords till December 18 2020, to identify observational studies reporting clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients using statins versus those not using statins. Prior and in-hospital use of statins were considered. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Unadjusted and adjusted pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% CIs were calculated. RESULTS: We included 14 observational studies pooling data retrieved from 19 988 patients with COVID-19. All the studies were of high/moderate quality. Pooled analysis of unadjusted data showed that statin use was not associated with improved clinical outcomes (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.50, p=0.94, I(2)=94%, random-effects model). However, on pooling adjusted risk estimates, the use of statin was found to significantly reduce the risk of adverse outcomes (OR 0.51; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.63, p<0.0005, I(2)=0%, fixed-effects model). CONCLUSIONS: Statin use is associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective single-center study included febrile infants <57 days evaluated in the Emergency Department of Cohen Children’s Medical Center of Northwell Health, New Hyde Park, New York during March 1-April 30 of 2018, 2019, and 2020. Sociodemographic and clinical features were compared between those seen during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and previous years, as well as between SARS-CoV-2 infected infants and SARS-CoV-2 uninfected infants (SARS-CoV-2 negative or evaluated during 2018 and 2019). RESULTS: In all, 124 febrile infants <57 days of age were identified; 38 during the 2-month study period in 2018, 33 in 2019, and 53 in 2020. During 2020, fewer febrile infants had a serious bacterial infection (SBI) or a positive respiratory viral panel (RVP) than in prior years (6% versus 21%, P = .02; 15% versus 53%, p<.001, respectively). SARS-CoV-2 was the most frequent pathogen detected in 2020; of 30 infants tested, 20 tested positive.

However, this procedure requires specialized medical personnel, centralized laboratory facilities, and time to provide results (from several hours up to 1 d). In addition, there is a non-negligible risk of viral transmission for the operator who performs the procedure. For these reasons, several studies have suggested the use of other body fluids, including saliva, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The use of saliva as a diagnostic specimen has numerous advantages: it is easily self-collected by the patient with almost no discomfort, it does not require specialized health care personnel for its management, and it reduces the risks for the operator. In the past few months, several scientific papers, media, and companies have announced the development of new salivary tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. Posterior oropharyngeal saliva should be distinguished from oral saliva, since the former is a part of respiratory secretions, while the latter is produced by the salivary glands, which are outside the respiratory tract. Saliva can be analyzed through standard (rRT-PCR) or rapid molecular biology tests (direct rRT-PCR without extraction), although, in a hospital setting, these procedures may be performed only in addition to nasopharyngeal swabs to minimize the incidence of false-negative results. Conversely, the promising role of saliva in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is highlighted by the emergence of point-of-care technologies and, most important, point-of-need devices. Indeed, these devices can be directly used in workplaces, airports, schools, cinemas, and shopping centers. An example is the recently described Rapid Salivary Test, an antigen test based on the lateral flow assay, which detects the presence of the virus by identifying the spike protein in the saliva within a few minutes.","Azzi, L.; Maurino, V.; Baj, A.; Dani, M.; d’Aiuto, A.; Fasano, M.; Lualdi, M.; Sessa, F.; Alberio, T.",J Dent Res,32,32

Co-sedimentation of the dengue E protein and HIV-1 core proteins by sucrose gradient analysis of the pseudotype reporter virus of dengue virus type 2, D2(HIVluc), and detection of HIV-1 core proteins by immunoprecipitation with anti-E monoclonal antibody suggested that dengue viral proteins were incorporated into the pseudotype viral particles. The infectivity in target cells, as assessed by the luciferase activity, can be inhibited by the lysosomotropic agents, suggesting a pH-dependent mechanism of entry. Amino acid substitutions of the leucine at position 107, a critical residue at the fusion loop of E protein, with lysine resulted in severe impairment in infectivity, suggesting that entry of the pseudotype reporter virus is mediated through the fusogenic properties of E protein. With more and more dengue viral sequences available from different outbreaks worldwide, this sensitive and convenient tool has the potential to facilitate molecular characterization of the PrM/E proteins of dengue field isolates.","Hu, Hsien-Ping; Hsieh, Szu-Chia; King, Chwan-Chuen; Wang, Wei-Kung",Virology,32,21

Here, we investigate the potential for two recently discovered bat rubulaviruses, Achimota virus 1 (AchPV1) and Achimota virus 2 (AchPV2), isolated from urine collected under urban bat (Eidolon helvum) roosts in Ghana, West Africa, to infect small laboratory animals. AchPV1 and AchPV2 are classified in the family Paramyxoviridae and cluster with other bat derived zoonotic rubulaviruses (i.e. Sosuga, Menangle and Tioman viruses). To assess the susceptibility of AchPV1 and AchPV2 in animals, infection studies were conducted in ferrets, guinea pigs and mice. Seroconversion, immunohistological evidence of infection, and viral shedding were identified in ferrets and guinea pigs, but not in mice. Infection was associated with respiratory disease in ferrets. Viral genome was detected in a range of tissues from ferrets and guinea pigs, however virus isolation was only achieved from ferret tissues. The results from this study indicate Achimota viruses (AchPVs) are able to cross the species barrier. Consequently, vigilance for infection with and disease caused by these viruses in people and domesticated animals is warranted in sub-Saharan Africa and the Arabian Peninsula where the reservoir hosts are present.","Barr, Jennifer; Todd, Shawn; Crameri, Gary; Foord, Adam; Marsh, Glenn; Frazer, Leah; Payne, Jean; Harper, Jenni; Baker, Kate S.; Cunningham, Andrew A.; Wood, James L.

Some things, however, seem relatively clear. So far, the agendas of the world's most powerful actors seem unchanged—or, indeed, accelerated. Partly as a result, disease mortality and economic losses have fallen largely on poorer people, though deaths so far have been concentrated among poorer people in rich countries. Consequently, the pandemic's implications look very different at the local, subnational, and international levels—although at all levels, they thus far reflect accelerations of preexisting trends more than new departures. Many developments reflect remarkable gains in human capacity to cope with disasters—a point highlighted by comparisons to the 1919 flu and other historical events pandemics made by the authors in this forum. Those gains are particularly evident in Asia, though they look more precarious in South Asia and Southeast Asia than in East Asia; this has contributed to a marked shift in rhetoric about global “sickness” and health and seems consistent with prophecies of a coming “Asian century.” However, COVID-19 may not be a singular event like 1919 but may portend a wave of environmental emergencies; in that scenario, no world region has exhibited as much resilience as it would need.","Pomeranz, Kenneth",J Asian Stud,32,1

METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study, in the form of an online survey. A total of 115 responses were finally included. RESULTS: The mean age was 73.18 ± 6.42. Eighty-nine reported symptoms in the post-recovery period; of these 54 had no symptoms of CFS, 60 were possible, and only 1 was probable. Fatigue was reported by 66, musculoskeletal symptoms by 56, and sleep problems by 73. Twenty-nine patients visited a doctor's office as a result. Post-recovery symptoms were significantly related to stress, sadness and sleep disturbances. Also, stress, sadness, sleep disturbances, fatigue, cognitive impairment, and recurrent falls were all significantly associated with CFS-like symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: From our findings, the presence of fatigue, cognitive impairment, stress, sadness, sleep disturbances and recurrent falls in the post-recovery period were all significantly associated with CFS-like symptoms. To conclude it would be reasonable to screen for long COVID and consider the potential for developing CFS later on. Whether it can be a risk factor for developing CFS-like other viral infections will need more larger scale studies to confirm this.","Aly, Menna A E G; Saber, Heba G",Int J Clin Pract,32,16

OBJECTIVE: (1) To quantify skin damage with increased usage frequency of ABHS by consumers and (2) To evaluate Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO) as natural prophylactic agent to counter the adverse effects. METHODS: In‐home usage study was carried out with 60 volunteers for a 15‐day intervention—Control Group: 6 applications per day of ABHS and Test Group: Overnight VCO use (6–8 drops) followed by 6× usage per day of ABHS. This leg included dermatological evaluation and WHO Self‐Assessment Scale for skin health. Another leg of measurement included non‐invasive instrumental study (Moisture & TEWL Probes, Tape Strip for protein content and IR spectroscopy for protein & lipid content) on forearm of 12 subjects (25–60 years age) with and without VCO application and repeated alcohol exposure. RESULTS: In‐home usage study established consumer experiencing skin protective effect of VCO in the context of ABHS onslaught. 25% increase in perceived moisture content was recorded for VCO users, using WHO Self‐Assessment Scale. Instrumental studies confirmed an increase in TEWL and decrease in lipids & protein content. Overnight VCO application resists the extraction which builds up with repeated application. CONCLUSIONS: Current work provides evidence of compromised hand skin barrier with ABHS daily usage. Overnight VCO application helps prepare the skin for next day alcohol use. Based on the findings, a regimen of overnight VCO application on hands as a natural prophylactic is recommended.","Saraogi, Punit; Kaushik, Vaibhav; Chogale, Ritesh; Chavan, Sneha; Gode, Vaishali; Mhaskar, Sudhakar",J Cosmet Dermatol,32,20

Index test results were compared with those derived from routine diagnostic tests, i.e., white blood cell (WBC) counts, neutrophil percentages, and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) levels. METHODS: This prospective, multicenter study was carried out in the most important children’s hospitals (n = 11) in Italy and 433 otherwise healthy children hospitalized for radiologically confirmed CAP were enrolled. Among cases for whom etiology could be determined, CAP was ascribed to bacteria in 235 (54.3%) children and to one or more viruses in 111 (25.6%) children. A total of 312 (72.2%) children had severe disease. RESULTS: CRP and PCT had the best performances for both bacterial and viral CAP identification. The cut-off values with the highest combined sensitivity and specificity for the identification of bacterial and viral infections using CRP were ≥7.98 mg/L and ≤7.5 mg/L, respectively. When PCT was considered, the cut-off values with the highest combined sensitivity and specificity were ≥0.188 ng/mL for bacterial CAP and ≤0.07 ng/mL for viral CAP. For the identification of severe cases, the best results were obtained with evaluations of PCT and MR-proANP. However, in both cases, the biomarker cut-off with the highest combined sensitivity and specificity (≥0.093 ng/mL for PCT and ≥33.8 pmol/L for proANP) had a relatively good sensitivity (higher than 70%) but a limited specificity (of approximately 55%). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that in children with CAP, sTREM-1, MR-proANP, and MR-proADM blood levels have poor abilities to differentiate bacterial from viral diseases or to identify severe cases, highlighting that PCT maintains the main role at this regard.","Esposito, Susanna; Di Gangi, Maria; Cardinale, Fabio; Baraldi, Eugenio; Corsini, Ilaria; Da Dalt, Liviana; Tovo, Pier Angelo; Correra, Antonio; Villani, Alberto; Sacco, Oliviero; Tenero, Laura; Dones, Piera; Gambino, Monia; Zampiero, Alberto; Principi, Nicola",PLoS One,32,23

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is perhaps one of the biggest threats to modern medicine; data show that 81% of antibiotics in the UK are prescribed in primary care. Aim: To identify where the perceived gaps in knowledge, skills, guidance and research around infections and antibiotic use lie from the general practitioner (GP) viewpoint. Design and Setting: An online questionnaire survey. Method: The survey, based on questions asked of Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) members in 1999, and covering letter were electronically sent to GPs between May and August 2017 via various primary care dissemination routes. Results: Four hundred and twenty-eight GPs responded. Suspected Infection in the elderly, recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), surveillance of AMR in the community, leg ulcers, persistent cough and cellulitis all fell into the top six conditions ranked in order of importance that require further research, evidence and guidance. Acute sore throat, otitis media and sinusitis were of lower importance than in 1999. Conclusion: This survey will help the NHS, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and researchers to prioritise for the development of guidance and research for chronic conditions highlighted for which there is little evidence base for diagnostic and management guidelines in primary care. In contrast, 20 years of investment into research, guidance and resources for acute respiratory infections have successfully reduced these as priority areas for GPs.","Lecky, Donna M.; Granier, Steve; Allison, Rosalie; Verlander, Neville Q.; Collin, Simon M.; McNulty, Cliodna A.

Insufficient training on refugee health poses a barrier to effective care delivery. METHODS: This workshop addressed common challenges in providing family-centered pediatric refugee care in community settings as well as barriers related to policy changes. Presentations covered prearrival experiences, medical screening, and trauma-based care. In small groups, participants discussed cases that featured medical, behavioral health, social, and cultural factors impacting the provision of family-centered pediatric care that was culturally respectful and included shared decision-making. After the breakout session, each small group informed the larger group of topics discussed. Facilitators identified themes and reinforced key learning points. At the workshop's conclusion, participants were guided to create their own personalized action plan. RESULTS: This workshop was presented at two international conferences to more than 47 participants, including clinicians, nurse practitioners, pediatric residents, and medical students. Evaluations were completed by 34 individuals.

METHODS: The Siemens SARS-CoV-2 Total (COV2T) and IgG (COV2G) antibody tests were evaluated on a Siemens Atellica IM1300 analyzer. Imprecision was assessed with the CLSI EP15 protocol using positive controls. Ninety control group specimens were analyzed for specificity, and 175 specimens from 58 patients with polymerase chain reaction–confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were measured for the sensitivity and kinetics of the antibody response. RESULTS: Within-run and total imprecision were acceptable for both assays. Both tests showed a specificity of 100%. Sensitivity earlier in the disease state was greater for the COV2T assay than for the COV2G assay, but sensitivity >14 days after onset of symptoms approached 100% for both. For all patients, antibody titers remained above the seroconversion cutoff for all follow-up specimens.

Being affected by the disease exposes the individual to an uncertain prognosis and a state of quarantine. These factors can predispose individuals to the development of mental symptoms during or after the acute phase of the disease. There is a need for prospective studies assessing psychiatric symptoms in COVID-19 patients in the post-infection period. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 tests were collected at patients' homes under the supervision of trained healthcare personnel. Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were classified as mild cases (N = 895) at treatment intake were further assessed for the presence of psychiatric symptoms (on average, 56.6 days after the intake). We investigated the association between the number of COVID-19 symptoms at intake and depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms approximately two months later, adjusting for previous mental health status, time between baseline and outcome, and other confounders. Multivariate logistic regression and generalized linear models were employed for categorical and continuous outcomes, respectively. RESULTS: A clinically significant level of depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms were reported by 26.2% (N = 235), 22.4% (N = 201), and 17.3% (N = 155) of the sample. Reporting an increased number of COVID-related symptoms was associated with the presence of clinically significant levels of depressive (aOR = 1.059;95%CI = 1.002–1.119), anxiety (aOR = 1.072;95%CI = 1.012–1.134), and post-traumatic stress (aOR = 1.092;95%CI = 1.024–1.166) symptoms. Sensitivity analyses supported findings for both continuous and categorical measures. CONCLUSION: Exposure to an increased number of COVID-19 symptoms may be associated with depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms after the acute phase of the disease. These patients should be monitored for the development of psychiatric symptoms after COVID-19 treatment discharge. Early interventions, such as brief interventions of psychoeducation on coping strategies, could benefit these individuals.","Ismael, Flavia; Bizario, João C.S.; Battagin, Tatiane; Zaramella, Beatriz; Leal, Fabio E.; Torales, Julio; Ventriglio, Antonio; Marziali, Megan E.; Martins, Silvia S.; Castaldelli-Maia, João M.",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,32,11

An outbreak of feline infectious peritonitis was investigated in a closed colony of European wildcats (Felis silvestris) at a zoological garden. Over a six-year period, a putative fading kitten syndrome occurred in six of 11 litters born and severe lesions of infectious peritonitis occurred in five of the eight wildcats retained in the colony during this period. Lesions were more acute in the early stages of the outbreak and included perivascular pyogranulomatous inflammation with exudative serositis. Lesions occurred only in males. Vascular lesions were common in the liver of all affected wildcats, serositis occurred in the abdominal and thoracic cavities in most cases and meningeal lesions were present in two cases. Immunohistochemistry with specific antisera detected viral antigen within macrophages in all lesions. This outbreak demonstrates that the lesions of feline infectious peritonitis can become modified over time and that the virus can persist in a closed colony, possibly via carrier wildcats.","Watt, N.

Although the nature of the institution affects IT adoption, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), a dominant theory, has dismissed its role and influence. Our research investigates how institutions influence the adoption of new IT by using the Institution-based Technology Acceptance Model (ITAM). We conducted an empirical test by using survey data collected from 300 employees in the public sector. Structural equation modeling was applied to test the proposed hypotheses. The results showed the total effect of institutions on the intention to use new IT is positive and significant. Second, IT adoption is not only affected by external institutions but also by type of institution; the external institution takes a greater role in inducing perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and intention to use than does the internal. Third, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness play mediating roles between institution and IT adoption. Fourth, an alternative expanded model to which more individual and organizational factors were added confirmed the results of the base model. We concluded that institutions have a strong impact on the level of intention for IT use through perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness.","Kang, Youngcheoul; Choi, Nakbum; Kim, Seoyong",Int J Environ Res Public Health,32,16

Aim: To assess the impact of PPE use on HCWs physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, we examined factors related to a greater risk of adverse events among HCWs due to PPE use. Methods: We applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines and the Cochrane criteria for this systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, Medline, Scopus, ProQuest, CINAHL, and pre-print services (medRxiv) from January 1, 2020 to December 27, 2020. Findings: Our review included 14 studies with 11,746 HCWs from 16 countries. The estimated overall prevalence of adverse events among HCWs was 78% (95% CI: 66.7-87.5%) with a range from 42.8% to 95.1% among studies. The prevalence of adverse events was higher for the studies with poor quality compared to those with moderate quality (83.5% vs. 67.1%), while increased sample size was related to decreased prevalence (p<0.001). The most frequent adverse events were headache (55.9%), dry skin (54.4%), dyspnoea (53.4%), pressure injuries (40.4%), itching (39.8%), hyperhidrosis (38.5%), and dermatitis (31.0%). Among others, the following factors were related to the risk of adverse events among HCWs due to PPE use: female gender, younger age, obesity, diabetes mellitus, smoking pre-existing headache, longer duration of shifts wearing PPE, increased consecutive days with PPE, and increased exposure to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: The frequency of adverse events amongst HCWs due to PPE use is very high. Further studies should be conducted since the limitations of this review do not allow us to infer conclusive results especially in case of risk factors for the occurrence of adverse events. Healthcare facilities should take the necessary precautions and change the working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent adverse events associated with PPE use and minimize harm to HCWs.","Galanis, P.

Two important products of tryptophan metabolism, viz kynurenine and interleukin (IL)4-inducible1 (IL41)-driven indole 3 pyruvate (I3P), activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), thereby altering the nature of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. AhR activation dysregulates the initial pro-inflammatory cytokines production driven by neutrophils, macrophages, and mast cells, whilst AhR activation suppresses the endogenous antiviral responses of natural killer cells and CD8+ T cells. Such immune responses become further dysregulated by the increased and prolonged pro-inflammatory cytokine suppression of pineal melatonin production coupled to increased gut dysbiosis and gut permeability. The suppression of pineal melatonin and gut microbiome-derived butyrate, coupled to an increase in circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) further dysregulates the immune response. The AhR mediates its effects via alterations in the regulation of mitochondrial function in immune cells. The increased risk of severe/fatal SARS-CoV-2 infection by high risk conditions, such as elderly age, obesity, and diabetes are mediated by these conditions having expression levels of melatonin, AhR, butyrate, and LPS that are closer to those driven by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This has a number of future research and treatment implications, including the utilization of melatonin and nutraceuticals that inhibit the AhR, including the polyphenols, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and resveratrol.","Anderson, George; Carbone, Annalucia; Mazzoccoli, Gianluigi",Int J Mol Sci,32,26

These devices periodically monitor the user’s vital signs and generally have a short battery life. This work introduces ODIN, a model for optimized vital signs collection based on adaptive rules. Analyzing vital sign values requires preciseness, so the adaption of these collected data allows a personalized analysis of the user’s health condition. The comparison with related works indicates that ODIN is the only model that presents context-aware-adaptive vital signs collection. The implementation of a prototype allowed to perform three evaluations of ODIN. The first evaluation used simulations in different scenarios, with the adaptive approach increasing battery life by 119% through the analysis of input data compared to data collection without adaptivity. The second evaluation applied the prototype to a database of real physiologic data, which allowed reduced data collection when the user has regular vital signs. This reduction optimized battery consumption by 66% compared to collection without adaptivity. Finally, the third evaluation applied ODIN through an Arduino and a heart rate monitor (Polar H7). The average power saved across mobile devices was 21%. Consequently, the adaptive strategy presented in this work allows the optimization of computational resources during the collection and analysis of vital signs. This optimization occurs because of the reduction in energy expenditure and the reduction in the amount of data that needs to be collected and stored.","Aranda, Jorge Arthur Schneider; Bavaresco, Rodrigo Simon; de Carvalho, Juliano Varella; Yamin, Adenauer Corrêa; Tavares, Mauricio Campelo; Barbosa, Jorge Luis Victória",J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput,32,1

Rapid microbiological diagnostics, linked to an algorithm to translate their results into antibiotic choices, could simultaneously improve patient outcomes and antimicrobial stewardship. METHODS: The INHALE Randomised Controlled Trial is a multi-centre, parallel study exploring the potential of the BioFire FilmArray molecular diagnostic to guide antibiotic treatment of HAP/VAP in intensive care units (ICU); it identifies pathogens and key antibiotic resistance in around 90 min. The comparator is standard care whereby the patient receives empirical antibiotics until microbiological culture results become available, typically after 48–72 h. Adult and paediatric ICU patients are eligible if they are about to receive antibiotics for a suspected lower respiratory infection (including HAP/VAP) for the first time or a change in antibiotic because of a deteriorating clinical condition. Breathing spontaneously or intubated, they must have been hospitalised for 48 h or more. Patients are randomised 1:1 to receive either antibiotics guided by the FilmArray molecular diagnostic and its trial-based prescribing algorithm or standard care, meaning empirical antibiotics based on local policy, adapted subsequently based upon local microbiology culture results. Co-primary outcomes are (i) non-inferiority in clinical cure of pneumonia at 14 days post-randomisation and (ii) superiority in antimicrobial stewardship at 24 h post-randomisation (defined as % of patients on active and proportionate antibiotics). Secondary outcomes include further stewardship reviews; length of ICU stay; co-morbidity indicators, including septic shock, change in sequential organ failure assessment scores, and secondary pneumonias; ventilator-free days; adverse events over 21 days; all-cause mortality; and total antibiotic usage. Both cost-effectiveness of the molecular diagnostic-guided therapy and behavioural aspects determining antibiotic prescribing are being explored. A sample size of 552 will be required to detect clinically significant results with 90% power and 5% significance for the co-primary outcomes. DISCUSSION: This trial will test whether the potential merits of rapid molecular diagnostics for pathogen and resistance detection in HAP/VAP are realised in patient outcomes and/or improved antibiotic stewardship.

We previously identified a novel adenovirus, titi monkey adenovirus (TMAdV), as the cause of a fulminant pneumonia outbreak in a colony of titi monkeys (Callicebus cupreus) at a national primate center in 2009. Serological evidence of infection by TMAdV was also found in a human researcher at the facility and household family member, raising concerns for potential cross-species transmission of the virus. Here we present experimental evidence of cross-species TMAdV infection in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). Nasal inoculation of a cell cultured-adapted TMAdV strain into three marmosets produced an acute, mild respiratory illness characterized by low-grade fever, reduced activity, anorexia, and sneezing. An increase in virus-specific neutralization antibody titers accompanied the development of clinical signs. Although serially collected nasal swabs were positive for TMAdV for at least 8 days, all 3 infected marmosets spontaneously recovered by day 12 post-inoculation, and persistence of the virus in tissues could not be established. Thus, the pathogenesis of experimental inoculation of TMAdV in common marmosets resembled the mild, self-limiting respiratory infection typically seen in immunocompetent human hosts rather than the rapidly progressive, fatal pneumonia observed in 19 of 23 titi monkeys during the prior 2009 outbreak. These findings further establish the potential for adenovirus cross-species transmission and provide the basis for development of a monkey model useful for assessing the zoonotic potential of adenoviruses.","Yu, Guixia; Yagi, Shigeo; Carrion, Ricardo; Chen, Eunice C.; Liu, Maria; Brasky, Kathleen M.; Lanford, Robert E.; Kelly, Kristi R.; Bales, Karen L.; Schnurr, David P.; Canfield, Don R.; Patterson, Jean L.; Chiu, Charles Y.",PLoS One,32,20

The study’s objective was to introduce a methodology to assess COVID-19 home deaths by analysing the French national out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) registry (RéAC). METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicentre cohort study based on data recorded in the RéAC by 20 mobile medical teams (MMTs) between March 1st and April 15th, 2020. The participating MMTs covered 10.1% of the French population. OHCA patients were classified as probable or confirmed COVID-19 cases or as non-COVID-19 cases. To achieve our primary objective, we computed the incidence and survival at hospital admission of cases of COVID-19 OHCA occurring at home. Cardiac arrests that occurred in retirement homes or public places were excluded. Hence, we estimated the number of at-home COVID-19-related deaths that were not accounted for in the French national statistics. RESULTS: We included 670 patients with OHCA. The extrapolated annual incidence of OHCA per 100,000 inhabitants was 91.9 overall and 17.6 for COVID-19 OHCA occurring at home. In the latter group, the survival rate after being taken to the hospital after an OHCA was 10.9%. We estimated that 1322 deaths were not accounted in the French national statistics on April 15, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The ratio of COVID-19 out-of-hospital deaths to in-hospital deaths was 12.4%, and so the national statistics underestimated the death rate.","Hubert, Hervé; Baert, Valentine; Beuscart, Jean-Baptiste; Chazard, Emmanuel",BMC Med Res Methodol,32,20

The coronavirus genome is highly prone to mutations that lead to genetic drift and escape from immune recognition; thus, it is imperative that sub-strains with different mutations are also accounted for during vaccine development. As the disease has grown to become a pandemic, B-cell and T-cell epitopes predicted from SARS coronavirus have been reported. Using the epitope information along with variants of the virus, we have found several variants which might cause drifts.

Aim: Describe characteristics and risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis in children tested in 20 pediatric centers across Italy. Methods: Cases aged 0-18 years tested for SARS-CoV-2 between February 23 and May 24 2020 were included. Our primary analysis focused on children tested because of COVID-19 suggestive symptoms. Results: Among 2494 children tested for SARS-CoV-2, 2148 (86.1%) had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. Clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 included, beside fever (82.4%) and respiratory signs or symptoms (60.4%), also gastrointestinal (18.2%), neurological (18.9%), cutaneous (3.8%) and other flu-like presentations (17.8%). In multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 were: exposure history (adjusted OR 39.83 95%CI 17.52-90.55 p<0.0001), cardiac disease (adjusted OR 3.10 95%CI 1.19- 5.02 p<0.0001), fever (adjusted OR 3.05 % 95% CI 1.67-5.58 p=0.0003), and anosmia/ageusia (OR 4.08 95%CI 1.69 -9.84 p=0.002). Among 190 (7.6%) children diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, only four (2.1%) required respiratory support and two (1.1%) were admitted in ICU, while 100% recovered. Conclusion: Recommendations for SARS-CoV-2 testing in children should be updated based on the evidence of broader clinical features. Exposure history, fever, and anosmia/ageusia are strong risk factors for COVID-19 in children, while other symptoms do not seem helping discriminating in between the SARS-CoV-2 positive and the negative cases.

Methods A single-institution, retrospective review of patients admitted for COVID-19 with a diagnosis of pneumothorax between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020 was performed. The primary assessment was the incidence of pneumothorax. Secondarily, we analyzed clinical outcomes of patients requiring tube thoracostomy, including those requiring operative intervention. Results From March 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020, 118 of 1595 patients (7.4%) admitted for COVID-19 developed a pneumothorax. Of these, 92 (5.8%) required tube thoracostomy drainage for a median of 12 days (IQR 5-25). The majority of patients (95/118, 80.5%) were on mechanical ventilation at the time of pneumothorax, 17 (14.4%) were iatrogenic, and 25 patients (21.2%) demonstrated tension physiology. Placement of a large-bore chest tube (20 Fr or greater) was associated with fewer tube-related complications than a small-bore tube (14 Fr or less) (14 vs 26 events, P=0.011). Six patients with pneumothorax (5.1%) required operative management for a persistent alveolar-pleural fistula. In patients with pneumothorax, median hospital stay was 36 days (IQR 20-63) and in hospital mortality was significantly higher than those without pneumothorax (58% vs 13%, P<0.001). Conclusions The incidence of secondary pneumothorax in patients admitted for COVID-19 is 7.4%, most commonly occurring in patients requiring mechanical ventilation, and is associated with an in-hospital mortality rate of 58%.

The emergence of novel PEDV strains in recent years has decreased the effectiveness of PEDV vaccines. We have developed a live recombinant vaccine, a swinepox virus vector that expresses a truncated S protein (rSPV-St) from a recent PEDV strain, SQ2014, and evaluated its immunogenicity and effectiveness in a swine model. Vaccination of swine with rSPV-St elicited a robust antibody response specific for the homologous PEDV SQ2014. Serum IgA titers in rSPV-St-vaccinated animals were significantly higher than in those immunized with inactivated vaccines. The effectiveness of antibodies induced by the rSPV-St vaccine in protection against PEDV was tested in a passive-transfer model in which piglets were challenged with the homologous virus SQ2014 and the heterologous strain CV777. When challenged with the homologous virus, sera from rSPV-St vaccination provided complete protection. However, sera from rSPV-St vaccination did not provide any protection against the heterologous virus challenge. Amino acid sequence differences in the S proteins of the two viruses were identified within neutralizing epitopes, which might have contributed to the divergent clinical results.

Since early in the pandemic, studies indicated a heightened risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in COVID-19 infected patients. There have been differing expert opinions about how to assess pretest probability of VTE in this patient population. This has been partly due to the high prevalence of respiratory failure in this patient population and the use of D-dimer as a prognostic test which is also frequently elevated in patients with COVID-19 in absence of VTE. Some experts have argued for an approach similar to usual care with testing if clinical suspicion is high enough. Some have argued for more routine screening at different points of care. Others have even suggested empiric therapeutic anti-coagulation in moderate to severely ill COVID-19 patients.

The aim of this study is to summarize the evidence from the available systematic reviews on the efficacy and safety of CP in COVID-19 through an overview of the published systematic reviews (SRs). A systematic literature search was conducted up to August 2021 in Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane and Medrxiv databases to identify systematic reviews focusing on CP use in COVID-19. Two review authors independently evaluated reviews for inclusion, extracted data and assessed quality of evidence using AMSTAR (A Measurement Tool to Assess Reviews) and GRADE tools. The following outcomes were analyzed: mortality, viral clearance, clinical improvement, length of hospital stay, adverse reactions. In addition, where possible, subgroup analyses were performed according to study design (e.g., RCTs vs. non-RCTs), CP neutralizing antibody titer and timing of administration, and disease severity. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the checklist for systematic reviews AMSTAR-2 and the GRADE assessment. Overall, 29 SRs met the inclusion criteria based on 53 unique primary studies (17 RCT and 36 non-RCT). Limitations to the methodological quality of reviews most commonly related to absence of a protocol (11/29) and funding sources of primary studies (27/29). Of the 89 analyses on which GRADE judgements were made, effect estimates were judged to be of high/moderate certainty in four analyses, moderate in 38, low in 38, very low in nine. Despite the variability in the certainty of the evidence, mostly related to the risk of bias and inconsistency, the results of this umbrella review highlight a mortality reduction in CP over standard therapy when administered early and at high titer, without increased adverse reactions.","Franchini, Massimo; Corsini, Fabiana; Focosi, Daniele; Cruciani, Mario",Diagnostics (Basel),32,22

We aimed to conduct this systematic review to understand better the potential effects of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on fetal loss in infected mothers presented with abortion following this infection. METHODS: We included articles published in PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, clinicaltrials.gov, and Embase databases in 2019 and 2020 through a comprehensive search via appropriate keywords, including COVID-19 and abortion synonyms. All studies with the abortion data in COVID-19 confirmed pregnant females were collected. RESULTS: Out of 208 potentially relevant articles, 11 articles were eligible to include in the systematic review. The included reports were published because of the following reasons: (1) First-trimester miscarriage; (2) Late miscarriage; (3) complication of COVID-19 infection in pregnancy; (4) COVID-19 disease in artificial pregnancy. First-trimester abortion was found in 5 studies, and second-trimester abortion in 7 studies. Two patients acquired infection during the hospital stay while they were referred for abortion. Reports related to abortion in pregnant females with COVID-19 show that most miscarriages due to COVID-19 in the first trimester were due to placental insufficiency. CONCLUSIONS: There is an increased risk of abortion in mothers with a positive test result of SARS-CoV-2, which several case reports and case series have identified during the pandemic. Placental inflammation during the viral infection may result in fetal growth retardation and induce abortion. There has not been any consistent evidence of vertical transmission of the virus from mother to fetus, which requires further investigation.","Kazemi, Seyyedeh Neda; Hajikhani, Bahareh; Didar, Hamidreza; Hosseini, Sareh Sadat; Haddadi, Sara; Khalili, Farima; Mirsaeidi, Mehdi; Nasiri, Mohammad Javad",PLoS One,32,17

This assembly can result in the production of constructs that are targeted to a specific site or cell type in order to enhance the response to, or activity of, the conjugated moiety. In the case of cancer treatments, selectively targeting chemotherapies to the cells of interest limit harmful side effects and enhance efficacy. Targeting through conjugation is also advantageous in delivering treatments to difficult-to-reach tissues, such as the brain or infections deep in the lung. Bacterial infections can be more selectively treated by conjugating antibiotics to microbe-specific entities; helping to avoid antibiotic resistance across commensal bacterial species. In the case of vaccine development, conjugation is used to enhance efficacy without compromising safety. In this work, we will review the previously mentioned areas in which bioconjugation has created new possibilities and advanced treatments.","Tummillo, Kristen M.; Hazlett, Karsten R.O.",Molecules,32,18

It mainly spreads via the respiratory route by means of aerosols. The objectives of our study were. To know the prevalence of ENT presentations in COVID 19 patients and to know the relationship between the symptoms and category of the disease as well as to know the relation between the blood group and recovery from the disease. The first 500 patients who were tested positive for COVID 19 and getting treated in our hospital were included in the study after taking written informed consent from the patients who were willing to participate in the study. A detailed history was taken from all the patients and more stress was given on the ENT symptoms with respect to its onset, duration and time taken for the relief of symptoms. The ENT symptoms were compared with the category of the disease as well as the blood group of the patients. Statistical analysis was done using Chi square test and Statistical Package for Social Sciences [SPSS] for Windows Version 22.0 Released 2013. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp., was used to perform statistical analyses. In our study 310 (62.0%) were males and 190 (38.0%) patients were females (38%), of age group ranging from 2 years to 87 years. In our study 367 (73.3%) patients were symptomatic and the rest 133 (26.6%) were asymptomatic. There were 335 (67.0%) patients in category A, 140 (28.0%) in category B and 25 (5.0%) in category C. The most common ENT presentation was headache and its prevelance was more in category C and it was of statistical significance. On comparing the blood group and the ENT symptoms occurrence of sore throat was of statistical significance and its prevelance was more among the O blood group patients. In terms of recovery from the disease the patients with blood group O had good recovery rate. Covid 19 pandemic is still an on going problem and newer strains of the virus are arising as well hence. In our study we found out that isolated ENT symptoms such as aguesia and anosmia were the only presentation of the disease. Thus they can be considered as early marker of the disease and it will be helpful in early detection and isolation of the patient as well as prevention of further spread of the disease.","Smitha, S.

This scenario in a way increased the rubber solid waste disposal problem; therefore, the production of biodegradable gloves may be an option to overcome this problem. However, the need to study the shelf life of biodegradable gloves is crucial before commercialization. There are well-established models to address the failure properties of gloves as stated in the American Society for Testing and Material (ASTM) D7160. In this study, polysaccharide-based material-filled natural rubber latex (PFNRL) gloves, which are biodegradable gloves, were subjected to an accelerated aging process at different temperatures of 50–80 °C for 1–120 days. Prediction models based on Arrhenius and shift factors were used to estimate the shelf life of the PFNRL gloves. Based on the results obtained, the estimated time for the PFNRL gloves to retain 75% of their tensile strength at shelf temperature (30 °C) based on Arrhenius and shift factor models was 2.8 years. Verification on the activation energy based on the shift factor model indicated that the shelf life of PFNRL gloves is 2.9 years, which is only a 3.6% difference. The value obtained is aligned with the requirement in accordance with ASTM D7160, which states that only up to a maximum of 3 years’ shelf life is allowed for the gloves under accelerated aging conditions.","Ab Rahman, Mohd Fikri; Rusli, Arjulizan; Misman, Muhammad Afiq; Rashid, Azura A.",ACS Omega,32,9

We sought to evaluate the professional and personal impact of the pandemic on 2019–2020 Breast Surgical Oncology (BSO) fellows in Society of Surgical Oncology approved programs to capture the experience and direct future changes. METHODS: From July 15, 2020 to August 4, 2020 a survey was administered to the American Society of Breast Surgeons' fellow members. The survey assessed the impact of the pandemic on clinical experience, education/research opportunities, personal health/well‐being, and future career. Responses were collected and aggregated to quantify the collective experience of respondents. RESULTS: Twenty‐eight of fifty‐seven (54%) eligible fellows responded. Twenty‐one (75%) indicated the clinical experience changed. Twenty‐seven (96%) reported less time spent caring for ambulatory breast patients and sixteen (57%) reported the same/more time spent in the operating room. Fourteen (50%) stated their future job was impacted and eight (29%) delayed general surgery board examinations. Stress was increased in 26 (93%). Personal health was unaffected in 20 (71%), and 3 (10%) quarantined for COVID‐19 exposure/infection. CONCLUSION: The COVID‐19 pandemic altered the clinical experience of BSO fellows; however, the operative experience was generally unaffected. The creation of frameworks and support mechanisms to mitigate potential challenges for fellows and fellowship programs in the ongoing pandemic and other times of national crisis should be considered.","Kilgore, Lyndsey J.; Murphy, Brittany L.; Postlewait, Lauren M.; Liang, Diana H.; Bedrosian, Isabelle; Lucci, Anthony; Kuerer, Henry M.; Hunt, Kelly K.; Teshome, Mediget",J Surg Oncol,32,24

The study aim was to determine the fit factor of surgical and other types masks commonly used in clinical settings compared with FFP3 filtering respirators. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out recruiting a total sample of 78 physicians. Fit factor was measured to determine particles count into masks compared to particles count outside of the masks meanwhile physicians carried out a protocol composed by 8 exercises as well as the global fit factor total scores. First, fit factor was analyzed with the usual surgical masks used by physicians in clinical settings. Second, fit factor was determined with the proposed FFP3 filtering respirators. Results: Most participants (97%) used surgical masks. Statistically significant differences (P<0.001) with an effect size from moderate to large (d=0.61-1.00) were shown for fit factors in the different exercises and total scores between surgical and other masks (3.2±5.0) and FFP3 filtering respirators (40.7±37.8). Generally, FFP3 filtering respirators showed a higher fit factor in the different exercises and total scores compared to the commonly used surgical and other types masks in clinical settings. Conclusions: Despite most physicians used surgical masks in clinical settings, filtering FFP3 masks showed a higher fit factor in the different exercises and total scores compared with the used surgical masks and filtering respirators such as FFP1, FFP2 and other types in clinical settings.","De-Yñigo-Mojado, Borja; Madera-García, Javier; Becerro-de-Bengoa-Vallejo, Ricardo; Losa-Iglesias, Marta Elena; Rodríguez-Sanz, David; San-Antolín, Marta; Calvo-Lobo, Cesar; López-López, Daniel",Int J Med Sci,32,20

DESIGN: We performed a single center retrospective study including 242 patients with confirmed COVID‐19. We described the characteristics of the complete blood count parameters in these patients. Mann Whitney‐U test was used to compare hematologic parameters of patients who died and those who survived; multivariate logistic regression was used to look for associations with mortality. RESULTS: Patients with COVID‐19 who died had significantly lower median absolute monocyte count (AMC) (0.4 vs 0.5, p=0.039) and median platelet count (169 vs 213, p=0.009) compared to those who survived.

Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) forms the mainstay in screening, diagnosis and epidemiology of the disease. Since the virus evolves by accumulating base substitutions, mutations in the viral genome could possibly affect the accuracy of RT-PCR-based detection assays. The recent availability of genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates motivated us to assess the presence and potential impact of variations in target sites of the oligonucleotide primers and probes used in molecular diagnosis. We catalogued a total of 132 primer or probe sequences from literature and data available in the public domain. Our analysis revealed that a total of 5862 unique genetic variants mapped to at least one of the 132 primer or probe binding sites in the genome. A total of 29 unique variants were present in ≥ 1% of genomes from at least one of the continents (Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America) that mapped to 36 unique primers or probes binding sites. Similarly, a total of 27 primer or probe binding sites had cumulative variants frequency of ≥ 1% in the global SARS-CoV-2 genomes. These included primers or probes sites which are used worldwide for molecular diagnosis as well as approved by national and international agencies. We also found 286 SARS-CoV-2 genomic regions with low variability at a continuous stretch of ≥ 20bps that could be potentially used for primer designing.

However, the influence of additive DMM on the production of inception and precursors of particulates, especially the relation between oxidation, morphology, and the nanostructure of soot particles has not been extensively investigated. In this study, a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and a thermogravimetric analyzer are introduced to acquire TEM images and conduct temperature-programmed-oxidation experiments. Aiming to study the influence of DMM addition on soot oxidation, morphology, and nanostructure, tests are conducted at different rotational speeds (1400 rpm and 2200 rpm), two engine loads (0.6 MPa and 1.2 MPa), and three fuels (D100, DMM6.4, and DMM13). The results show that the diameter distributions of all samples display a similar distribution, with the range of sample diameters being from 10 to 45 nm, and the addition of DMM reduces the dp (primary particle diameters) and the Df (fractal dimension), indicating a decreased structural compactness of aggregates, compared with diesel. Moreover, with increasing load and speed, La (the length of the fringe) increases and d (the distance between adjacent layer planes) decreases. Furthermore, with the addition of DMM, a more regular and higher degree of graphitization within soot particles can be observed in comparison to D100. The nanostructure influences the oxidation reaction of graphene segments with a line relation, leading to a difference in soot oxidation property.","Qian, Weiwei; Huang, Haozhong; Pan, Mingzhang; Huang, Rong; Wei, Jiangjun; Liu, Jing",Fuel (Lond),32,16

This tenet holds true for diseases affecting both the thoracic and neurological systems; in isolation, the radiologic appearance of disease in one organ system may be nonspecific, but viewing the pathophysiologic process in both organ systems may markedly narrow the differential considerations, and potentially lead to a definitive diagnosis. In this article, we discuss a variety of disease entities known to affect both the thoracic and neurological systems, either manifesting simultaneously or at different periods of time. Some of these conditions may show neither thoracic nor neurological manifestations. These diseases have been systematically classified into infectious, immune-mediated / inflammatory, vascular, syndromic / hereditary and neoplastic disorders.

With the use of more sensitive cardiac biomarkers and advanced cardiovascular imaging, MINOCA presentations have gain increasing attention among researchers and cardiologists. Despite the presence of a myocardial infarction and elevated future risk, many patients are sent home with little or no cardio-protective treatment and no explanation for their symptoms. In this review, we emphasized the importance of MINOCA treatment based on the underlying etiology. RECENT FINDINGS: As there are multiple pathophysiological mechanisms potentially involved in MINOCA, it should be considered a working diagnosis until there is a better understanding regarding the underlying cause. It is critical to use multimodality imaging when treating patients with MINOCA to help determine the underlying etiology and rule out mimics of MINOCA, so that therapies appropriate to the etiology can be provided.

Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were identified from reports of SARS-CoV-2-positive laboratory test results to South Central Public Health District. Information on symptoms, hospitalization, recent travel, healthcare worker status, and close contacts was obtained by medical record review and patient interviews. Viral sequence analysis was conducted on a subset of available specimens. During March 13-April 10, 2020, a total of 451 COVID-19 cases occurred among Blaine County residents (1,959 cases per 100,000 population). An additional 37 cases occurred in out-of-state residents. Among the 451 COVID-19 patients, the median age was 51 years (Interquartile range [IQR]: 37-63), 52 (11.5%) were hospitalized, and 5 (1.1%) died. The median duration between specimen collection and a positive laboratory result was 9 days (IQR: 4-10). Forty-four (9.8%) patients reported recent travel. Healthcare workers comprised 56 (12.4%) cases; 33 of whom worked at the only hospital in the county, leading to a 15-day disruption of hospital services. Of 562 close contacts monitored by public health authorities, 22 (3.9%) had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and an additional 29 (5.2%) experienced compatible symptoms. Sequencing results from 34 Idaho specimens supported epidemiologic findings indicating travel as a source of SARS-CoV-2, and identified multiple lineages among hospital workers. Community mitigation strategies included school and resort closure, stay-at-home orders, and restrictions on incoming travelers. COVID-19 outbreaks in rural communities can disrupt health services.

These viral mutations are consistent, rather than stochastic, and long-lived. When Se-deficient virus-infected hosts were supplemented with dietary Se, viral mutation rates diminished and immunocompetence improved. Herein is described the role of micronutrient Se deficiency on the evolution of some contemporary RNA viruses and their subsequent VIDs.

Regardless of their smoking status, males [1.084(1.021 - 1.151)] and the 50-69-year-old patients [1.082 (1.014 -1.154)] were more likely to test positive for COVID-19, while end stage renal disease [0.908(0.843- 0.978)] and non-COVID-19 respiratory viral illness [0.907 (0.863 - 0.953)] patients had a lower risk of COVID-19 positivity. Heart failure [0.907 (0.830 - 0.991)], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [0.842 (0.745 - 0.952)] and Parkinsons disease [0.823 (0.708 - 0.957)] never-smokers were less likely to test positive for COVID-19. Conclusion: This is the first study to show that smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 positivity among the 40-49-year-old patients, while not smoking reduces the risk of COVID-19 positivity among the heart failure, COPD and Parkinsons disease patients. This study emphasizes that COVID-19 positivity risk is not reduced by smoking and not increased by not smoking.

The coronavirus that causes it can remain in the stool of some infected patients for a short period, even after recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia. Studies have increasingly reported the involvement of other organs, including the gastrointestinal system, in addition to the respiratory system. Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease with an unknown cause. Emerging data suggest that the gas trointestinal system may be influenced by COVID-19 via the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), but data on the association between COVID-19 and inflammatory bowel diseases, including ulcerative colitis, are lacking. In this report, we describe a case of ulcerative colitis diagnosed in a 50-year-old male patient who presented with complaints of bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain following the completion of treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia. It is possible for the novel coronavirus to trigger ulcerative colitis. Hence, patients presenting with gastrointestinal com plaints should also be evaluated for COVID-19.","Aydın, Muhammet Fatih; Taşdemir, Hamit",The Turkish journal of gastroenterology : the official journal of Turkish Society of Gastroenterology,32,16

Four weeks later, he succumbed to death due to acute renal and respiratory failure. Although he did not present with any symptoms specific for Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID19), he obtained positive testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), before he died. S1 antigen-binding notably showed significant levels for IgG, while nucleocapsid IgG/IgM was not elicited . By means of autopsy, acute bronchopneumonia and acute tubular failure were assigned as cause death of death. However, we did not observe any characteristic morphological features of COVID19. Postmortem molecular mapping by real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) additionally revealed relevant SARS-CoV-2 Ct values in all organs examined (oropharynx, olfactory mucosa, trachea, lungs, heart, kidney, and cerebrum) except for liver and olfactory bulb. These results might contribute to the view that first vaccination induces immunogenicity, but not sterile immunity.","Hansen, Torsten; Titze, Ulf; Kulamadayil-Heidenreich, Nidhi Su Ann; Glombitza, Sabine; Tebbe, Johannes Josef; Röcken, Christoph; Schulz, Birte; Weise, Michael; Wilkens, Ludwig",Int J Infect Dis,32,16

However, there is limited evidence on mHealth apps designed for pregnant women who are at high risk of developing UI. This pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility of conducting an effectiveness trial for a newly developed PFMT app among pregnant women in Malaysia. Methods: This is a prospective, single-centre, single-blind, randomised controlled pilot feasibility study: The Kegel Exercise Pregnancy Training app (KEPT-app) Trial. Sixty-four incontinent pregnant women who attended one primary care clinic for the antenatal follow-up will be recruited and randomly assigned to either intervention or waitlist control group. The intervention group will receive the intervention, the KEPT-app developed from the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) theory with Persuasive Technology and Technology Acceptance Model. Discussion: This study will provide a fine-tuning for our future randomised control study on the recruitment feasibility methods, acceptability, feasibility, and usability of the KEPT-app, and the methods to reduce the retention rates among pregnant women with UI. Trial registration: This study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov on 19 February 2021 (NCT04762433) and is not yet recruiting.","Jaffar, Aida; Mohd Sidik, Sherina; Foo, Chai Nien; Muhammad, Noor Azimah; Abdul Manaf, Rosliza; Fadhilah Ismail, Siti Irma; Suhaili, Nazhatussima",Int J Environ Res Public Health,32,16

Therefore, it has been perplexing and enigmatic to witness the growing homeless population sleeping outside in public areas in recent years. Public actions have been called for to deal with the problem. However, the approach of these public actions has depended on how the problem of homelessness has been defined. This paper presents a historical context of how homelessness has been presented in policy discourses. Further, on the basis of a survey conducted in 2004, this paper describes the profile of the homeless and discusses why the homeless began sleeping on the streets. Finally, an outreach worker narrates his story about working with the homeless in Taipei City, the capital of Taiwan. The paper also includes policy implications in terms of appropriate public actions to be taken in response to the homelessness problem in Taiwan.","Cheng, Li-Chen; Yang, Yun-Sheng","City, Culture and Society",32,28

While the majority of those infected will not have long-term pulmonary sequelae, 5%–10% will develop severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The natural history of these severely affected patients is unclear at present, but using our knowledge of closely related coronavirus outbreaks like severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), we would hypothesize that the majority will stabilize or improve over time although some patients will progress to advanced lung fibrosis or post-COVID interstitial lung disease (PC-ILD). Unlike the SARS and MERS outbreaks which affected only a few thousands, the sheer scale of the present pandemic suggests that physicians are likely to encounter large numbers of patients (potentially hundreds of thousands) with PC-ILD. In this review, we discuss the pathogenesis, natural history, and radiology of such patients and touch on clinical, laboratory, and radiographic clues at presentation which might help predict the future development of lung fibrosis. Finally, we discuss the responsible use of antifibrotic drugs such as pirfenidone, nintedanib, and some newer antifibrotics, still in the pipeline. The biological rationale of these drugs and the patient groups where they may have a plausible role will be discussed. We conclude by stressing the importance of careful longitudinal follow-up of multiple cohorts of post-COVID survivors with serial lung function and imaging. This will eventually help to determine the natural history, course, and response to therapy of these patients.","Udwadia, Zarir F; Koul, Parvaiz A; Richeldi, Luca",Lung India,32,11

METHODS: We performed a prospective, multicenter, observational study of adults admitted with ILI during three influenza seasons (2012–2015). Patients were screened for picornavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, parainfluenza virus, and influenza, by PCR on nasopharyngeal samples. We excluded patients coinfected with NIRV and influenza. RESULTS: Among 1421 patients enrolled, influenza virus was detected in 535 (38%), and NIRV in 215 (15%), mostly picornavirus (n = 61), RSV (n = 53), coronavirus 229E (n = 48), and human metapneumovirus (n = 40). In-hospital mortality was 5% (NIRV), 4% (influenza), and 5% (no respiratory virus). As compared to influenza, NIRV were associated with age (median, 73 years vs. 68, P = 0.026), chronic respiratory diseases (53% vs. 45%, P = 0.034), cancer (14% vs. 9%, P = 0.029), and immunosuppressive drugs (21% vs. 14%, P = 0.028), and inversely associated with diabetes (18% vs. 25%, P = 0.038). On multivariable analysis, only chronic respiratory diseases (OR 1.5 [1.1–2.0], P = 0.008), and diabetes (OR 0.5 [0.4–0.8], P = 0.01) were associated with NIRV detection. CONCLUSIONS: NIRV are common in adults admitted with ILI during influenza seasons. Outcomes are similar in patients with NIRV, influenza, or no respiratory virus.","Bénézit, François; Loubet, Paul; Galtier, Florence; Pronier, Charlotte; Lenzi, Nezha; Lesieur, Zineb; Jouneau, Stéphane; Lagathu, Gisèle; L’Honneur, Anne-Sophie; Foulongne, Vincent; Vallejo, Christine; Alain, Sophie; Duval, Xavier; Houhou, Nawal; Costa, Yolande; Vanhems, Philippe; Amour, Sélilah; Carrat, Fabrice; Lina, Bruno; Launay, Odile; Tattevin, Pierre",Infection,32,1
