The mechanism of PM-mediated pathophysiology remains unknown. However, PM is proinflammatory to the endothelium and increases vascular permeability in vitro and in vivo via ROS generation. OBJECTIVES: We explored the role of tight junction proteins as targets for PM-induced loss of lung endothelial cell (EC) barrier integrity and enhanced cardiopulmonary dysfunction. METHODS: Changes in human lung EC monolayer permeability were assessed by Transendothelial Electrical Resistance (TER) in response to PM challenge (collected from Ft. McHenry Tunnel, Baltimore, MD, particle size >0.1 μm). Biochemical assessment of ROS generation and Ca(2+) mobilization were also measured. RESULTS: PM exposure induced tight junction protein Zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) relocation from the cell periphery, which was accompanied by significant reductions in ZO-1 protein levels but not in adherens junction proteins (VE-cadherin and β-catenin). N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC, 5 mM) reduced PM-induced ROS generation in ECs, which further prevented TER decreases and atteneuated ZO-1 degradation. PM also mediated intracellular calcium mobilization via the transient receptor potential cation channel M2 (TRPM2), in a ROS-dependent manner with subsequent activation of the Ca(2+)-dependent protease calpain. PM-activated calpain is responsible for ZO-1 degradation and EC barrier disruption. Overexpression of ZO-1 attenuated PM-induced endothelial barrier disruption and vascular hyperpermeability in vivo and in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that PM induces marked increases in vascular permeability via ROS-mediated calcium leakage via activated TRPM2, and via ZO-1 degradation by activated calpain. These findings support a novel mechanism for PM-induced lung damage and adverse cardiovascular outcomes.","Wang, Ting; Wang, Lichun; Moreno-Vinasco, Liliana; Lang, Gabriel D; Siegler, Jessica H; Mathew, Biji; Usatyuk, Peter V; Samet, Jonathan M; Geyh, Alison S; Breysse, Patrick N; Natarajan, Viswanathan; Garcia, Joe G N",Part Fibre Toxicol,407,8
3339,3339,3339,Potential and challenges of tannins as an alternative to in-feed antibiotics for farm animal production,15.746772,4.2076917,2017-10-14,"Naturally occurring plant compounds including tannins, saponins and essential oils are extensively assessed as natural alternatives to in-feed antibiotics. Tannins are a group of polyphenolic compounds that are widely present in plant region and possess various biological activities including antimicrobial, anti-parasitic, anti-viral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulation, etc. Therefore, tannins are the major research subject in developing natural alternative to in-feed antibiotics. Strong protein affinity is the well-recognized property of plant tannins, which has successfully been applied to ruminant nutrition to decrease protein degradation in the rumen, and thereby improve protein utilization and animal production efficiency. Incorporations of tannin-containing forage in ruminant diets to control animal pasture bloat, intestinal parasite and pathogenic bacteria load are another 3 important applications of tannins in ruminant animals. Tannins have traditionally been regarded as “anti-nutritional factor” for monogastric animals and poultry, but recent researches have revealed some of them, when applied in appropriate manner, improved intestinal microbial ecosystem, enhanced gut health and hence increased productive performance. The applicability of plant tannins as an alternative to in-feed antibiotics depends on many factors that contribute to the great variability in their observed efficacies.","Huang, Qianqian; Liu, Xiuli; Zhao, Guoqi; Hu, Tianming; Wang, Yuxi",Anim Nutr,407,1

Airborne bacteria were collected during three different periods from May to October 2009 using air sampling directly on agar plates. A total of 140 isolates were collected during three sampling campaigns, and 74 % (103) of these isolates were analyzed by all three methods. The dominant genera in Norway and Finland were the gram-positive bacteria Bacillus and Staphylococcus, whereas the gram-negative bacterium Acinetobacter was the dominant genus in Sweden. Using 16S rDNA sequencing, MALDI-TOF MS and MIDI MIS analysis, 83, 79 and 75 %, respectively, of the isolates were identified and assigned to order or higher taxonomic levels. In this study, the MALDI-TOF MS combining with the MALDI Biotyper 2.0 classification tool was demonstrated to be a fast and reliable alternative for identifying the airborne bacterial isolates. These studies have increased knowledge about the airborne bacterial background in outdoor air, which can be useful for evaluating and improving the operational performance of biological detectors in various environments. To our knowledge, this is the first time that 16S rDNA sequencing, MALDI-TOF MS and MIDI MIS analysis technologies have been compared for their efficiency in identifying airborne bacteria.","Fykse, Else Marie; Tjärnhage, Torbjörn; Humppi, Tarmo; Eggen, Vilde Sørvik; Ingebretsen, Andre; Skogan, Gunnar; Olofsson, Göran; Wästerby, Pär; Gradmark, Per-Åke; Larsson, Anders; Dybwad, Marius; Blatny, Janet Martha",Aerobiologia (Bologna),407,1

A specific probe was encompassed the conservative region of norovirus and F(0)F(1)-ATPase within chromatophore was constructed as a molecular motor biosensor through the “ε-subunit antibody-streptomycin-biotin-probe” system. Norovirus was captured based on probe-RNA specific binding. Our results demonstrated that the Limit of Quantification (LOQ) is 0.005 ng/mL for NV RNA and also demonstrated that this method possesses specificity and none cross-reaction for food borne virus. What’s more, the experiment used this method could be accomplished in 1 h. We detected 10 samples by using this method and the results were consistent with RT-PCR results. Overall, based on F(0)F(1)-ATPase molecular motors biosensor system we firstly established a new typed detection method for norovirus detection and demonstrated that this method is sensitive and specific and can be used in the rapid detection for food borne virus.","Zhao, Zhuo; Zhang, Jie; Xu, Mei-Ling; Liu, Zhi-Peng; Wang, Hua; Liu, Ming; Yu, Yan-Yan; Sun, Li; Zhang, Hui; Wu, Hai-Yan",Biotechnol Bioprocess Eng,407,1

To ascertain the influence of different plant species on nitrogen (N) cycling, we performed a long‐term garden experiment with six grasses and five dicots with different potential growth rates, that are adapted to habitats with different nutrient supplies. We measured in situ N mineralization and nitrification of the soil under monocultures of each species during the fourth year of the experiment. 2.. We focused on the effects of the different species on (i) annual net N mineralization; (ii) the seasonal pattern of N mineralization; and (iii) the fraction of the total N mineralization that is nitrified. Our hypothesis was that plant species of nutrient‐rich habitats would enhance the N mineralization compared with species of nutrient‐poor habitats. 3.. The results demonstrate a strong influence of the species on net N mineralization and net nitrification, both of which fluctuated strongly during the year. Overall, species from high fertility habitats increased N mineralization and nitrification more than species from low fertility habitats. About 90% of the mineralized ammonium was oxidized to nitrate. There was no significant difference in this proportion in the plots of species from nutrient‐rich, moderate and nutrient‐poor habitats.","Van Der Krift, Tanja A. J.; Berendse, Frank",J Ecol,407,1

To evaluate the immunogenicity of the anti-influenza A H1N1/2009 vaccine in RA and spondyloarthritis (SpA) patients receiving distinct classes of anti-TNF agents compared with patients receiving DMARDs and healthy controls. Methods. One hundred and twenty patients (RA, n = 41; AS, n = 57; PsA, n = 22) on anti-TNF agents (monoclonal, n = 94; soluble receptor, n = 26) were compared with 116 inflammatory arthritis patients under DMARDs and 117 healthy controls. Seroprotection, seroconversion (SC), geometric mean titre, factor increase in geometric mean titre and adverse events were evaluated 21 days after vaccination. Results. After immunization, SC rates (58.2% vs 74.3%, P = 0.017) were significantly lower in SpA patients receiving anti-TNF therapy, whereas no difference was observed in RA patients receiving this therapy compared with healthy controls (P = 0.067). SpA patients receiving mAbs (infliximab/adalimumab) had a significantly lower SC rate compared with healthy controls (51.6% vs 74.3%, P = 0.002) or those on DMARDs (51.6% vs 74.7%, P = 0.005), whereas no difference was observed for patients on etanercept (86.7% vs 74.3%, P = 0.091). Further analysis of non-seroconverting and seroconverting SpA patients revealed that the former group had a higher mean age (P = 0.003), a higher frequency of anti-TNF (P = 0.031) and mAbs (P = 0.001) and a lower frequency of MTX (P = 0.028). In multivariate logistic regression, only older age (P = 0.015) and mAb treatment (P = 0.023) remained significant factors for non-SC in SpA patients. Conclusion.

This model assists institutions in providing care and education that delivers support to members who have undergone traumatic experiences, and many institutions apply the principles as a universal precaution. Student and trainee experiences in medical education reveal a hidden curriculum that may deliver conflicting messages about the values of an institution, in which equity is promoted, but biased and discriminatory practices are commonplace. Implicit racial bias has been identified in the patient-provider interaction and may also extend its impact on the learner experience. Bias and discrimination inflict trauma on its targets via emotional injury. Applying the principles of the trauma-informed approach, we advocate for trauma-informed medical education (TIME). TIME fosters awareness that students and trainees can experience trauma from a biased system and culture and advocates for the establishment of policies and practices that support learners to prevent further re-traumatization.

However, acquired resistance occurs during its administration. To understand the molecular mechanisms of anlotinib resistance, we characterized chromatin accessibility in both the parental and anlotinib-resistant lung cancer cell line NCI-H1975 through ATAC-seq. Compared with the parental cells, we identified 2666 genomic regions with greater accessibility in anlotinib-resistant cells, in which angiogenesis-related processes and the motifs of 21 transcription factors were enriched. Among these transcription factors, TFAP2A was upregulated. TFAP2A knockdown robustly diminished tumor-induced angiogenesis and partially rescued the anti-angiogenic activity of anlotinib. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis indicated that 2280 genes were downregulated in anlotinib-resistant cells with TFAP2A knocked down, among which the PDGFR, TGF-β, and VEGFR signaling pathways were enriched. Meanwhile, we demonstrated that TFAP2A binds to accessible sites within BMP4 and HSPG2.

Although there is increasing evidence for its invaluable support at high altitude, some controversy remains, largely due to differences in individual preconditions, evaluation purposes, measurement methods, the use of different devices, and the lacking ability to interpret data correctly. Therefore, this review is aimed at providing information on the functioning of pulse oximeters, appropriate measurement methods and published time courses of pulse oximetry data (peripheral oxygen saturation, (SpO(2)) and heart rate (HR), recorded at rest and submaximal exercise during exposure to various altitudes. Results: The presented findings from the literature review confirm rather large variations of pulse oximetry measures (SpO(2) and HR) during acute exposure and acclimatization to high altitude, related to the varying conditions between studies mentioned above. It turned out that particularly SpO(2) levels decrease with acute altitude/hypoxia exposure and partly recover during acclimatization, with an opposite trend of HR. Moreover, the development of acute mountain sickness (AMS) was consistently associated with lower SpO(2) values compared to individuals free from AMS. Conclusions: The use of finger pulse oximetry at high altitude is considered as a valuable tool in the evaluation of individual acclimatization to high altitude but also to monitor AMS progression and treatment efficacy.","Dünnwald, Tobias; Kienast, Roland; Niederseer, David; Burtscher, Martin",Sensors (Basel),407,22

The target application and the performance can be inherently tuned by control of configuration, shape, and size of Ag nanostructures. In this work, we demonstrate the systematical fabrication of various configurations of Ag nanostructures on sapphire (0001) by controlling the Ag deposition thickness at different annealing environments in a plasma ion coater. In particular, the evolution of Ag particles (between 2 and 20 nm), irregular nanoclusters (between 30 and 60 nm), and nanocluster networks (between 80 and 200 nm) are found be depended on the thickness of Ag thin film. The results were systematically analyzed and explained based on the solid-state dewetting, surface diffusion, Volmer–Weber growth model, coalescence, and surface energy minimization mechanism. The growth behavior of Ag nanostructures is remarkably differentiated at higher annealing temperature (750 °C) due to the sublimation and temperature-dependent characteristic of dewetting process. In addition, Raman and reflectance spectra analyses reveal that optical properties of Ag nanostructures depend on their morphology.

METHODS: In this retrospective observational study from January 2015 to May 2020, multimodal imaging data of 807 eyes including 555 consecutive patients with RVO or 252 consecutive patients with RAO were reviewed. All patients were scanned using the spectrum-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), and some of them underwent color fundus photography, fundus fluorescence angiography, en face OCT, and OCT angiography. RESULTS: PAMM was detected in 49 eyes of 49 RAO patients and 29 eyes of 29 RVO patients. The mean ages at presentation were 64.49 ± 13.90 years and 54.00 ± 18.48 years in RAO and RVO patients (P=0.006), respectively. Eyes with RAO were more prone to develop PAMM (19.44% [49/252] vs. 5.23% [29/555]; P < 0.001). Of the 78 eyes with PAMM, 24 eyes (7 eyes with RVO and 17 eyes with RAO) were found with p-MLM sign. An interesting phenomenon that had been overlooked before was that the hyperreflective line of the p-MLM sign was usually continuous, regardless of the type of PAMM lesion. CONCLUSIONS: This series is the largest to date to describe the clinical characteristics of PAMM and p-MLM sign in Chinese patients. The incidence of PAMM and p-MLM sign in patients with RAO was relatively higher than that in patients with RVO. These signs alone probably represent milder ischemia and prompt us to carry out a comprehensive and meticulous examination to prevent the further development of the disease. In addition, the hyperreflective line of the p-MLM sign was usually continuous, which could support the totally venous nature of the retinal deep capillary plexus to some extent.","Zhang, Zhengwei; Jiang, Yunjia; Huang, Xiaoli; Wu, Zhifeng; Ke, Bilian",J Ophthalmol,407,1

[METHODS]: A systematic review was conducted to identify studies on vitamin D in athletes that assessed serum vitamin D levels, vitamin D and physical performance, vitamin D and musculoskeletal injuries, and practical guidelines for supplementation of vitamin D. [RESULTS]: Several studies reported that a high proportion of athletes had vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency. Low serum levels of vitamin D in athletes were more pronounced in winter than in other seasons, and indoor athletes had lower serum vitamin D levels than outdoor athletes. Low vitamin D levels have been demonstrated to have negative effects on muscle strength, power, and endurance; increase stress fractures and other musculoskeletal injuries; and affect acute muscle injuries and inflammation following high-intensity exercises. Therefore, periodic assessment and monitoring of vitamin D levels are necessary in athletes; the recommended serum level of 25(OH)D is > 32 ng/mL and the preferred level is > 40 ng/mL (-1). In those with low levels of vitamin D, exposure to sunlight and an improved diet or supplements may be helpful. Particularly, 2000–6000 IU of supplemental vitamin D3 can be consumed daily. [CONCLUSION]: Vitamin D is a potential nutritional factor that can significantly affect physical performance and musculoskeletal injuries in athletes. The importance and role of vitamin D in athletes should be emphasized, and the current levels of vitamin D should be assessed. Therefore, it is essential to periodically evaluate and monitor serum vitamin D levels in athletes.","Yoon, Sewoon; Kwon, Ohkyu; Kim, Jooyoung",Phys Act Nutr,407,1

We have seen in the previous chapter how disease became associated in the public mind with threats from “outsiders,” which led to medically unwarranted quarantines in the 19th and early 20th centuries. After those fears subsided and the Great Influenza Epidemic of 1918 ran its course, the field of public health settled into a sleepy backwater of the law, and the strategy for suppression of disease came to depend more on scientific discoveries such as penicillin and the polio vaccine.","Hunter, Nan D.",The Law of Emergencies,407,5
31348,31348,31348,COVID-19 and the Air We Breathe,15.904195,4.2356267,2020-04-15,"Rationale: We have previously demonstrated that bioinformatics tools such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) are capable of performing pathogen‐, genome‐ and HLA‐wide predictions of peptide–HLA interactions. These tools may therefore enable a fast and rational approach to epitope identification and thereby assist in the development of vaccines and immunotherapy. A crucial step in the generation of such bioinformatics tools is the selection of data representing the event in question (in casu peptide–HLA interaction). This is particularly important when it is difficult and expensive to obtain data. Herein, we demonstrate the importance in selecting information‐rich data and we develop a computational method, query‐by‐committee, which can perform a global identification of such information‐rich data in an unbiased and automated manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this method can be applied to an efficient iterative development strategy for these bioinformatics tools. Methods: A large panel of binding affinities of peptides binding to HLA A*0204 was measured by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). This data was used to develop multiple first generation ANNs, which formed a virtual committee. This committee was used to screen (or ‘queried’) for peptides, where the ANNs agreed (‘low‐QBC’), or disagreed (‘high‐QBC’), on their HLA‐binding potential. Seventeen low‐QBC peptides and 17 high‐QBC peptides were synthesized and tested. The high‐ or low‐QBC data were added to the original data, and new high‐ or low‐QBC second generation ANNs were developed, respectively. This procedure was repeated 40 times. Results: The high‐QBC‐enriched ANN performed significantly better than the low‐QBC‐enriched ANN in 37 of the 40 tests. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that high‐QBC‐enriched networks perform better than low‐QBC‐enriched networks in selecting informative data for developing peptide–MHC‐binding predictors. This improvement in selecting data is not due to differences in network training performance but due to the difference in information content in the high‐QBC experiment and in the low‐QBC experiment. Finally, it should be noted that this strategy could be used in many contexts where generation of data is difficult and costly.","Lamberth, K.; Nielsen, M.; Lundegaard, C.; Worning, P.; Laurmøller, S.

Several variants of the problem have been considered, depending on the fact that the match is exact or approximate and, in this latter case, which edit operations are considered and where are allowed. In this paper we present results on the complexity of the approximate matching problem, where edit operations are symbol substitutions and are allowed only on the graph labels or both on the graph labels and the query string. We introduce a variant of the problem that asks whether there exists a path in a graph that represents a query string with any number of edit operations and we show that is NP-complete, even when labels have length one and in the case the alphabet is binary. Moreover, when it is parameterized by the length of the input string and graph labels have length one, we show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable and it is unlikely to admit a polynomial kernel. The NP-completeness of this problem leads to the inapproximability (within any factor) of the approximate matching when edit operations are allowed only on the graph labels. Moreover, we show that the variants of approximate string matching to graph we consider are not fixed-parameter tractable, when the parameter is the number of edit operations, even for graphs that have distance one from a DAG. The reduction for this latter result allows us to prove the inapproximability of the variant where edit operations can be applied both on the query string and on graph labels.","Dondi, Riccardo; Mauri, Giancarlo; Zoppis, Italo",Language and Automata Theory and Applications,407,16

With an amikacin MIC of 8 mg/L, the C(max) should be 64–80 mg/L. This objective is based on clinical breakpoints and not on measured MIC. This study aimed to assess the proportion of patients achieving the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target C(max)/MIC ≥ 8 using the measured MIC in critically ill patients treated for documented Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) infections. METHODS: Retrospective analysis from February 2016 to December 2017 of a prospective database conducted in 2 intensive care units (ICU). All patients with documented severe GNB infections treated with amikacin (single daily dose of 25 mg/kg of total body weight (TBW)) with both MIC and C(max) measurements at first day of treatment (D1) were included. Results are expressed in n (%) or median [min–max]. RESULTS: 93 patients with 98 GNB-documented infections were included. The median C(max) was 55.2 mg/L [12.2–165.7] and the median MIC was 2 mg/L [0.19–16]. C(max)/MIC ratio ≥ 8 was achieved in 87 patients (88.8%) while a C(max) ≥ 64 mg/L was achieved in only 38 patients (38.7%). Overall probability of PK/PD target attainment was 93%. No correlation was found between C(max)/MIC ratio and clinical outcome at D8 and D28. CONCLUSION: According to PK/PD parameters observed in our study, single daily dose of amikacin 25 mg/kg of TBW appears to be sufficient in most critically ill patients treated for severe GNB infections.","Logre, Elsa; Enser, Maya; Tanaka, Sébastien; Dubert, Marie; Claudinon, Aurore; Grall, Nathalie; Mentec, Hervé; Montravers, Philippe; Pajot, Olivier",Ann Intensive Care,407,1

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary care teaching hospital in Boston, MA. PATIENTS: All patients over 18 years old admitted to the medical, surgical, or cardiac ICUs from 2013 to 2016, and who received cisatracurium for at least 24 hours. INTERVENTIONS: We examined patients for whom sedation was decreased despite accompanying ongoing neuromuscular blockade administration. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 300 patients who met inclusion criteria (39% female, mean age of 57 yr old), 168 (56%) had sedation down-titrated while receiving neuromuscular blockade with a mean decrease in sedation dose of 18.7%. Factors associated with down-titration of sedation were bispectral index usage (90/168 [53.6%] vs 50/168 [29.8%] patients; p < 0.01; odds ratio, 1.82; 1.12–2.94), and bolus dose of neuromuscular blockade prior to continuous infusion (138/168 [82.1%] vs 79/168 [47.0%] patients; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Down-titration of sedation among mechanically ventilated patients receiving neuromuscular blockade was common and was correlated with bispectral index monitor usage. Clinicians should be aware of the limitations of quantitative electroencephalography monitoring devices and recognize their potential to cause inappropriate down-titration of sedation. Substantial opportunity exists to improve the quality of care of patients receiving neuromuscular blockade through development of guidelines and standardized care pathways.","Poole, Brian R.; Reese, Zachary A.; Dechen, Tenzin; Tocci, Noah; Elsamadisi, Pansy; Holland, Susan; Hayes, Margaret M.; Stevens, Jennifer P.",Crit Care Explor,407,16

However, the existing hydrography ontologies are developed with varying project perspectives and objectives, which inevitably results in the differences in terms of knowledge representation. Determining various relationships between two entities in different ontologies offers the opportunity to link hydrographical data for multiple purposes, though the research on this topic is in its infancy. Different from the traditional ontology alignment whose cardinality is 1:1, i.e. one source ontology entity is mapping with one target ontology entity and vice versa, and the relationship is the equivalence, matching hydrography ontologies is a more complex task, whose cardinality could be 1:1, 1:n or m:n and the relationships could be equivalence or subsumption. To efficiently optimize the ontology alignment, in this paper, a discrete optimal model is first constructed for the ontology matching problem, and then a Compact Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (CPSO) based matching technique is proposed to efficiently solve it. CPSO utilizes the compact real-value encoding and decoding mechanism and the objective-decomposing strategy to approximate the PSO’s evolving process, which can dramatically reduce PSO’s memory consumption and runtime while at the same time ensure the solution’s quality. The experiment exploits the Hydrography dataset in Complex track provided by the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) to test our proposal’s performance. The experimental results show that CPSO-based approach can effectively reduce PSO’s runtime and memory consumption, and determine high-quality hydrography ontology alignments.","Wang, Yifeng; Yao, Hanguang; Wan, Liangpeng; Li, Hua; Jiang, Junjun; Zhang, Yun; Wu, Fangmin; Chen, Junfeng; Xue, Xingsi; Dai, Cai",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,407,16

We previously reported that disruption of the galU or galE gene in G. parasuis results in increased sensitivity to porcine serum, indicating that the galactose catabolism pathway is required for polysaccharide formation in G. parasuis. Here, we evaluated the role of the HAPS_0849 gene in LOS synthesis. The G. parasuis SC096 HAPS_0849 mutant produced a highly truncated LOS molecule, although a small fraction of intact LOS was still observed, and this mutant was found to be more sensitive to serum than the parental strain. HAPS_0849 was overexpressed and purified for biochemical assays, and this protein exhibited phosphoglucomutase (PGM) activity. Heterologous expression of a pgm gene from Escherichia coli in the HAPS_0849 mutant led to restoration of the wild-type LOS glycoform, further demonstrating the PGM function of HAPS_0849 in G. parasuis. The autoagglutination and biofilm formation ability of this strain were also investigated. Disruption of HAPS_0849 led to an increased tendency to autoagglutinate and form more biofilms, and these enhanced phenotypes were observed in the absence of glucose. In addition, LOSs from HAPS_0849, galU and lgtB mutants had similar truncated glycoforms, while LOSs from the galE and lex-1 mutants exhibited another type of defective LOS pattern. These findings imply that HAPS_0849 may function upstream of GalU in the generation of glucose 1-phosphate. In conclusion, our results preliminarily described the functions of HAPS_0849 in G. parasuis, and this gene was partially required for LOS synthesis.","Feng, Saixiang; Chen, Aihua; Wang, Xiaobing; Pan, Zhichao; Xu, Siqi; Yu, Huiwen; Zhang, Bin; Liao, Ming",Vet Res,407,1

Most of the containment zones of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Kolkata Municipal Corporation found a significant relation with slum areas. The study primarily tries considering the nature of SARS-CoV-2 cases in different urban centres with the help of cartographic techniques. AHP method has been used to determine the factors responsible for such concentration of SARS-CoV-2 cases with vulnerability assessment (exposure, sensitivity and resilience) and risks. Before nationwide lockdown starts, the share of urban centres found 25% which has been transformed into nearly 60% at the end of 3(rd) phase of lockdown. Growth rate of SARS-CoV-2 cases found very high for Chennai and Thane with less number of doubling time to nation. Slum concentration and containment density shows a higher degree of correlation in Kolkata Municipal Corporation.

METHODS: A cross-sectional comparative study before/after PP was conducted on 40 ICU patients over 18 years who received invasive ventilation (IV) for at least 48 h. The considered ventilator modes were: assisted control volume with a low trigger flow (between − 2 and 2 L/mn) and pressure support mode. US diaphragmatic assessments were performed at SP and at 60 min of PP. Both End-inspiratory and End-expiratory diameters (EID/EED) were taken at 3 levels of axillary lines and determined by the average values of multiple measures. Diaphragmatic thickening fraction (DTF) was calculated as: DTF = (EID − EED/EED) × 100. Pairing and ANOVA tests were used for comparisons. RESULTS: Forty ventilated patients (42 years of median age) at 4 days [2–7] of median duration of ventilation were examined during the two positions: SP versus PP. EID decreased from the SP to the PP (2.8 mm in SP vs. 2.4 mm in PP, p = 0.001). No difference was showed regarding the expiratory thickness. Overall, DTF didn’t change in PP (37.4 vs. 42.05%, p = 0.36). When the patient was placed in PP, the best DTF value was showed at the posterior part of diaphragm (posterior: 45%, median: 31% and anterior: 38%, p = 0.049). CONCLUSION: The ventral placement in ventilated patients reduced end-inspiratory diameter and tended to decrease DTF. In PP, the best contractile activity was detected at the posterior region of diaphragm.","Trifi, Ahlem; Abdellatif, Sami; Abdennebi, Cyrine; Daly, Foued; Touil, Yosr; Ben Lakhal, Salah",J Ultrasound,407,1

However, widespread use of antiviral drugs brings with it the danger of drug resistance evolution. To assess the risk of the emergence and diffusion of resistance, in this paper, we develop a diffusive influenza model where influenza infection involves both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains. We first analyze its corresponding reaction model, whose reproduction numbers and equilibria are derived. The results show that the sensitive strains can be eliminated by treatment. Then, we establish the existence of the three kinds of traveling waves starting from the disease-free equilibrium, i.e., semi-traveling waves, strong traveling waves and persistent traveling waves, from which we can get some useful information (such as whether influenza will spread, asymptotic speed of propagation, the final state of the wavefront). On the other hand, we discuss three situations in which semi-traveling waves do not exist. When the control reproduction number [Formula: see text] is larger than 1, the conditions for the existence and nonexistence of traveling waves are determined completely by the reproduction numbers [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] and the wave speed c. Meanwhile, we give an interval estimation of minimal wave speed for influenza transmission, which has important guiding significance for the control of influenza in reality. Our findings demonstrate that the control of influenza depends not only on the rates of resistance emergence and transmission during treatment, but also on the diffusion rates of influenza strains, which have been overlooked in previous modeling studies. This suggests that antiviral treatment should be implemented appropriately, and infected individuals (especially with the resistant strain) should be tested and controlled effectively. Finally, we outline some future directions that deserve further investigation.","Chen, Guoting; Fu, Xinchu; Sun, Mengfeng",Bull Math Biol,407,1

In some situations that need to be clearly defined, ALI methods may represent a complement or an alternative option to in vivo experimentations or classic in vitro methods. However, it is clear that many different approaches exist and that only very limited validation studies have been carried out to date. This means comparison of data from different methods is difficult and available methods are currently not suitable for use in regulatory assessments. This is despite inhalation toxicology being a priority area for many governmental organizations. In this setting, a 1-day workshop on ALI in vitro models for respiratory toxicology research was organized in Paris in March 2016 to assess the situation and to discuss what might be possible in terms of validation studies. The workshop was attended by major parties in Europe and brought together more than 60 representatives from various academic, commercial, and regulatory organizations. Following plenary, oral, and poster presentations, an expert panel was convened to lead a discussion on possible approaches to validation studies for ALI inhalation models. A series of recommendations were made and the outcomes of the workshop are reported.","Lacroix, Ghislaine; Koch, Wolfgang; Ritter, Detlef; Gutleb, Arno C.; Larsen, Søren Thor; Loret, Thomas; Zanetti, Filippo; Constant, Samuel; Chortarea, Savvina; Rothen-Rutishauser, Barbara; Hiemstra, Pieter S.; Frejafon, Emeric; Hubert, Philippe; Gribaldo, Laura; Kearns, Peter; Aublant, Jean-Marc; Diabaté, Silvia; Weiss, Carsten; de Groot, Antoinette; Kooter, Ingeborg",Appl In Vitro Toxicol,407,16

MAIN BODY: Many pathophysiologic and immunologic mechanisms have been implicated in stroke occurring among patients with COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has, in different ways, negative impacts on care of stroke patients worldwide, and still, many challenges are faced by neurologists to improve care of stroke patients during such crisis. In this brief report, we try to discuss these issues. CONCLUSIONS: Although the control of COVID-19 is of crucial importance, at the same time, the management of stroke must not be neglected. Therefore, introducing care for critical conditions such as stroke, and providing strategies to ensure this proceeds, is a priority even at the time of the pandemic.","Mohamed, Sherif; Abd El-Mohsen, Seham; Abo El-Hassan, Osama; AbdElHaffez, Azza; Abd El-Aziz, Nashwa",Egypt J Bronchol,407,22

Thousands of people have lost their lives, and the social operating system has been affected seriously. Thus, it is urgent to study the determinants of the virus and the health conditions in specific populations and to reveal the strategies and measures in preventing the epidemic spread. In this study, we first adopt the long short-term memory algorithm to predict the infected population in China. However, it gives no interpretation of the dynamics of the spread process. Also the long-term prediction error is too large to be accepted. Thus, we introduce the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model and further the metapopulation SEIR (mSEIR) model to capture the spread process of COVID-19. By using a sliding window algorithm, we suggest that the parameter estimation and the prediction of the SEIR populations are well performed. In addition, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to show the trend of the infected population for several provinces. The results may provide some insight into the research of epidemics and the understanding of the spread of the current COVID-19.","Chen, Duxin; Yang, Yifan; Zhang, Yifan; Yu, Wenwu",Sci,407,1

We propose that older adults’ perceived chances of survival, and one’s perceptions of whether they will outlive their spouse may be powerful motivators of ACP. Using data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS, n=4908, M age = 65), we examine the extent to which: (a) one’s perceived 10- and 20-year survival and (b) projections of dying before, after, or at the same time as one’s spouse affect three aspects of ACP (living will, durable power of attorney for health care designations (DPAHC), and discussions). Multivariate analyses are adjusted for health, demographics, socioeconomic characteristics, and death anxiety. In the full sample, women who perceived a high likelihood of 20-year survival were less likely (OR=.604, p < .05) whereas their male counterparts were more likely (OR = 1.4, p <.01) to name a DPAHC (relative to those who perceived a medium likelihood of survival). Among married persons only (n=3860), people who perceive that they will pre-decease their spouse are 1.5 times as likely to name their spouse as DPAHC (vs. no DPAHC), but are no more likely to name a different person to the role (relative to those who perceive that they and spouse will die at the same time). Practitioner and family conversations about older patients’ projected survival and how it shapes decision making are especially important as COVID-19 may require rapid decisions about end-of-life treatments.","Carr, Deborah; Lou, Yifan",Innov Aging,407,16

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of engaging in STEM project-based learning (PBL) activities on students’ mathematical problem-solving beliefs (PSB) and their perceptions towards SEM subjects and STEM careers. The data were collected using mathematical problem-solving belief and STEM semantics surveys. Participants (n = 68) were secondary students who participated in a STEM summer camp in which STEM PBL activities were utilized. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, paired-sample t tests, 95% confidence intervals, Cohen’s d effect sizes, and linear regression. Results showed that students increased their mathematical PSB (p < .001, d = .50) and perceptions towards science (p < .001, d = .68), engineering (p = .002, d = .56), mathematics (p = .015, d = .42), and STEM careers (p < .001, d = .86). Additionally, the linear regression analysis revealed that students’ mathematical PSB predicted their STEM career perceptions positively and statistically significantly (p < .05). These results support providing students with STEM PBL activities to increase their PSB and perceptions towards SEM subjects and STEM careers. Educators should utilize the results to provide opportunities for students to experience STEM PBL activities.","Kwon, Hyunkyung; Capraro, Robert M.; Capraro, Mary Margaret",Can,407,17

Leadership principles will be much affected by the development of future HMI. Technological development can lead to significant increases in productivity, but it will depend on how these gains are distributed between economic and social groups. Even in the year 2030, people will still be superior to machines and use them as tools, not the other way around. Therefore, the tools will develop depending on the goals of the people. If they are aimed at enforcing the superiority of the respective system, the relationship between man and machine in both countries will show considerable differences and will no longer be compatible, but even contrary to each other.","Heinke, Andrej",Managing Work in the Digital Economy,407,1

The traditional antifouling strategy usually uses toxic antifouling agents, which gradually exposes a serious environmental problem. Therefore, green, long-term, broad-spectrum and eco-friendly antifouling technologies have been the main target of engineers and researchers. In recent years, many eco-friendly antifouling technologies with broad application prospects have been developed based on the low toxicity and non-toxicity antifouling agents and materials. In this review, contemporary eco-friendly antifouling technologies and materials are summarized into bionic antifouling and non-bionic antifouling strategies (2000–2020). Non-bionic antifouling technologies mainly include protein resistant polymers, antifoulant releasing coatings, foul release coatings, conductive antifouling coatings and photodynamic antifouling technology. Bionic antifouling technologies mainly include the simulated shark skin, whale skin, dolphin skin, coral tentacles, lotus leaves and other biology structures. Brief future research directions and challenges are also discussed in the end, and we expect that this review would boost the development of marine antifouling technologies.","Tian, Limei; Yin, Yue; Bing, Wei; Jin, E.",J Bionic Eng,407,10

We hypothesize that having family members or close contacts who were diagnosed with COVID-19 before one’s own diagnosis exacerbates illness severity due to several potential mechanisms including changes in available social support access, increased stress and strain, and increased viral load due to the nature of one’s exposure to the novel coronavirus. We analyze administrative data of all 417 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Chinese city of Shenzhen between January 8 and February 25, 2020. Our analyses show that, when patients had family members or close ties diagnosed with COVID-19, they experienced more severe illness. We also find that patients with infected family members or close contacts did not have significantly extended total illness duration, due to their reduced time to diagnosis. The implications of both findings are discussed.","Yan, Xuewen; Qu, Tianyao; Sperber, Nathan; Lu, Jinyuan; Fan, Mengzhen; Cornwell, Benjamin",Am Behav Sci,407,24

This will in turn impact systems for and participation in lifelong learning. There is a risk for increased social inequalities, as neither telework nor lifelong learning is evenly distributed among workers. Statistics on telework in the EU show that there are differences between age groups, nations, sectors, and professions. If these trends will steer forward, there is a risk of widening gaps between countries, companies, and workers. To establish the current knowledge base, we have gathered literature reviews from several disciplines. One finding is that the previous literature on telework has not included lifelong learning in any form (formal, non-formal and informal). Based on a review of previous studies, we suggest a number of research questions for future research. This is relevant as research about telework and lifelong learning has the potential to contribute to a sustainable working life in terms of providing more flexible arrangements for employees and to support the lifelong learning that takes place in contexts such as the office, home, online meetings, and virtual reality.","Bjursell, Cecilia; Bergmo-Prvulovic, Ingela; Hedegaard, Joel",Front Sociol,407,1

In addition to the risks directly associated with the health emergency, many organizations were plunged into crisis because of severe restrictions to their operations and income losses. This analysis examines crisis communication in an organization faced with major financial losses, staff redundancies, and disruption. It analyses how these and necessary crisis responses were communicated to stakeholders, using situational crisis communication theory (SCCT), as its analytical framework. While noting alternative perspectives such as crisis and emergency risk communication (CERC) theory, SCCT is identified as the most widely applied theory of crisis communication, and thus warrants ongoing review in an era of media fragmentation, disinformation, and low public trust. Furthermore, this analysis provides a relatively rare “inside” (emic) perspective through ethnography and autoethnography conducted by a senior decision-maker in the organization studied, which expands traditional outside (etic) perspectives and offers new insights into crisis communication.","Macnamara, Jim",,407,0

The gene expression of many of these regulators is controlled by different epigenetic modifications. The remarkable impact of epigenetic changes in inducing or suppressing inflammatory signaling is being increasingly recognized. Several studies have highlighted the interplay of histone modification, DNA methylation, and post-transcriptional miRNA-mediated modifications in inflammatory diseases, and inflammation-mediated tumorigenesis. Targeting these epigenetic alterations affords the opportunity of attenuating different inflammatory dysregulations. In this regard, many studies have identified the significant anti-inflammatory properties of distinct naturally-derived phytochemicals, and revealed their regulatory capacity. In the current review, we demonstrate the signaling cascade during the immune response and the epigenetic modifications that take place during inflammation. Moreover, we also provide an updated overview of phytochemicals that target these mechanisms in macrophages and other experimental models, and go on to illustrate the effects of these phytochemicals in regulating epigenetic mechanisms and attenuating aberrant inflammation.","Saleh, Haidy A.; Yousef, Mohamed H.; Abdelnaser, Anwar",Front Immunol,407,16

METHODS: The COVID Ready 2 study is a national cross-sectional study of all medical students at UK medical schools. We will compare opinions of those who did and did not volunteer to determine the educational benefit and issues they faced. We will use thematic analysis to identify themes in qualitative responses, in addition to quantitative analysis. RESULTS: The primary objective is to explore the effect of volunteering during the pandemic on medical education in comparison to those who did not volunteer. Our secondary objectives are to identify: whether students would be willing to assume similar roles in a non-pandemic setting; if students found the experience more or less beneficial than traditional hospital placements and reasons for this; what the perceived benefits and disadvantages of volunteering were; the difference in perceived preparedness between students who did and did not volunteer for foundation training year one and the next academic year; training received by volunteers; and to explore issues associated with volunteering, including safety issues and issues with role and competence. CONCLUSIONS: We anticipate this study will help identify volunteer structures that have been beneficial for students, so that similar infrastructures can be used in the future; and help determine whether formal voluntary roles should be introduced into the non-pandemic medical curriculum.","Byrne, Matthew H V; Ashcroft, James; Alexander, Laith; Wan, Jonathan; Harvey, Anna; Clelland, Andrew; Schindler, Nick; Brassett, Cecilia; Vance, Gillian; Burford, Bryan; Raj, Vigneshwar; Brown, Anmol Arora Megan E L; Bandyopadhyay, Soham; Dominic, Catherine; Dawidziuk, Siena Hayes Aleksander; Kinder, Florence; Sravanam, Sanskrithi; Kawka, Michal; Vaughan, Adam; Byrne, Matthew",BJS Open,407,1

It is mostly seen with benign mesenchymal tumors. Establishing the diagnosis could be challenging due to occult nature of the disease. Case: A 54-year-old female presented with right thigh and upper back pain. On presentation, she had hypophosphatemia (1.8 mq/dl), low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (23 ng/ml), normal ionized calcium and normal iPTH (53 pg/mL). CT scan showed healing right 10(th) rib fracture and right proximal femoral fracture. DEXA scan was remarkable for osteoporosis. 99m-Technetium nuclear bone scan displayed hyperactivity on bilateral femurs and multiple ribs concerning for stress fractures. Patient was thought to have osteomalacia from vitamin D insufficiency and started on ergocalciferol. Two months later, patient was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. She had unilateral mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy. Surveillance studies were negative for recurrence. Patient lost to follow up for 2 years until she returned with right hip and upper back pain. Her labs showed hypophosphatemia (1.2 mg/dL), normocalcemia, elevated iPTH (131 pg/mL), low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (26 ng/ml), low normal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (25 pg/ml, normal: 18 -72) and elevated FGF23 (285 RU/ml, normal level <180). 24-hour urine studies showed phosphate of 330 mg and fractional phosphate excretion (FEPO4) of 12%. Nuclear bone scan reported subacute fractures in left 11(th) and right 6(th) ribs and right proximal femur. TIO was entertained as the unifying diagnosis. She was started on calcium, phosphate, ergocalciferol and calcitriol. Localizing studies with a PET scan showed FDG hyperactivity in the right vocal cord. Subsequent MRI showed asymmetric fat tissue between esophagus and left common carotid artery concerning for lipoma. She lost to follow up again during COVID-19 pandemic. Discussion: We present a case of elevated FGF23 with renal phosphate wasting concerning for TIO. This case represents the diagnostic dilemma of elevated FGF23 as well as difficulty in discerning the source in TIO. Although exact tumor source remained unclear in our patient, adipose tissue in the thoracic inlet was a potential culprit. Elevated FGF23 leads to urinary phosphate wasting and inhibition of 1α- hydroxylase. Daily urine phosphate excretion > 100 mg or FEPO4 > 5 % strongly suggest renal phosphate wasting. TIO and iron-induced hypophosphatemia are two most common acquired causes of high FGF23. TIO is mostly caused by benign soft tissue and bone tumors. It can take years to establish the diagnosis due to small size and obscure location of the tumors. Advanced investigation with FDG-PET, (68)Ga-DOTATATE scan, octreotide scan and venous sampling of FGF23 can aid in diagnosis. Tumor resection is usually curative. Burosumab (anti-FGF23 monoclonal antibody) can be considered when the tumor is not amenable to resect.","Bulut, Aysegul; Pena, Samara",J Endocr Soc,407,1

This public policy provides a unique bundle of benefits, such as tax incentives, public loan guarantees, and a more flexible labor law, for firms registered as “innovative startups” in Italy. This legislation has been implemented by the Italian government to increase innovativeness of small and young enterprises by facilitating access to (external) capital and (high-skilled) labor. Consequently, the goal of our evaluation is to assess the impact of the policy on equity, debt, and employment. Using various conditional difference-in-difference models, we find that the Italian innovative startup policy has met its primary objectives. The econometric results strongly suggest that Italian innovative startups are more successful in obtaining equity and debt capital and they also hire more employees because of the program participation.","Biancalani, Francesco; Czarnitzki, Dirk; Riccaboni, Massimo",Small Bus Econ,407,1

GI symptoms similar to the ones presented in acute pancreatitis (AP) have been reported. SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, which have been identified in the lungs and pancreas. It has been discussed that systemic response to the infection prompts dysregulation in the affected organs. Hyperglycemia is an independent risk factor for increased mortality and thus a detailed assessment must be performed. A 47 year-old man with dyslipidemia arrived at the ER due to a severe constant epigastric pain of 1 day of evolution with back radiation associated with nauseas, emesis, and hyporexia. Upon examination he was tachycardic and in distress due to pain. Laboratories revealed normocytosis, normal hemoglobin, mild thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia (150 mg/dL), corrected hyponatremia (130 mmol/L), and corrected hypocalcemia (7.4 mg/dL). Amylase (2,332 U/L) and lipase (2,990 U/L) were elevated. Triglycerides were 6,256 mg/dL and glycated hemoglobin was 6.1%. Abdominal CT scan revealed pancreatitis. He was admitted to the ICU due to severe AP due to hypertriglyceridemia with IV hydration and IV insulin infusion. During the first day of admission, he developed respiratory distress requiring intubation, marked abdominal distension, hemodynamic instability, and oliguria. Intra-abdominal pressure yielded 24 mmHg leading to the diagnosis of abdominal compartment syndrome. He underwent emergent abdominal decompressive laparotomy with Bogota Bag placement. COVID-19 PCR test was performed and reported positive. 72 hours later, triglycerides improved and IV insulin was discontinued, but hyperglycemic state prompted subcutaneous basal and correction boluses. Insulin requirement progressively decreased and was discontinued after 14 days. He continued to show clinical improvement and by day 40, the patient was successfully extubated and discharged after physical rehabilitation. SARS-CoV-2 infection has shown a complex multisystem involvement leading to variable presentations which can be fatal if not identified and addressed properly. Albeit, AP is a rare manifestation of COVID-19, clinicians should be aware and pay attention to the related complications. Proposed mechanisms for hyperglycemia and AP include β-cell damage. The pathogenetic role of COVID-19 in hypertriglyceridemia is unclear. Little attention has been paid to the extent of pancreatic injury caused by this virus. To our knowledge this is the second case presenting with hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and AP in COVID-19 infection. As the global pandemic is still growing, elucidation of key pathways and mechanisms underlying these associations would aid in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 worldwide.","Torres, Marina Torres; Rodriguez, Kimberly Padilla; Vergne-Santiago, Norma; Diez, Andrea del Toro; Bossolo, Alex N Gonzalez; Garcia, Michelle Marie Mangual; Torres, Gabriela Torres",J Endocr Soc,407,22

Our study aimed to assess whether new Urology referrals could be triaged and have an outcome arranged virtually before being seen by a specialist in clinic, thereby reducing referral to investigation wait-times. METHOD: Retrospective data was collected from 23(rd) March to 8(th) May 2020 of new patient referrals consulted virtually in Urology outpatient clinics. Referrals were grouped into categories of presentation and outcome. RESULTS: 642 new patients were consulted virtually during the study period. 181 (28.1%) had further imaging requested; of these, the presentations with the greatest proportion of patients with this outcome were those referred with imaging findings (50%), UTI/cystitis (43.1%) and scrotal symptoms (34.3%). 116 patients (18.1%) were added to the waiting list for procedures; 85 were for flexible cystoscopy, for which the commonest indications were UTI/cystitis (36; 55.4%) and haematuria (15; 55.5%).

This impact was marked for individuals with long-term health conditions and comorbid depression and anxiety. Many face-to-face mental health services switched to remote delivery or paused therapeutic input entirely, despite the lack of research on the efficacy of switching between modalities mid-therapy or having breaks in therapy. This paper presents the case of a patient with long-term health conditions who experienced both breaks in therapy and a switch in modalities from face-to-face to telephone delivery. The intervention used was based on transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy and self-report measures were completed at the beginning and end of the twelve sessions. Despite the shift in modalities, the patient experienced clinically significant recovery on all measures, indicating the efficacy of therapy was not greatly affected by the shift in modalities. Long breaks in therapy were linked to deterioration in mental health, although this could be due to the deterioration in physical health that necessitated these breaks. This case highlights the benefits and challenges of a shifting modality of therapy during treatment and in response to a pandemic for a shielding population. From the work presented here, it seems beneficial for services to be able to work across multiple modalities to suit the needs of the patients and ensure continuity of treatment. It also indicates that pauses in therapy may risk deterioration. Further work is needed to prevent digital exclusion of patients.","Saunders, Jess; Allen, Chris",Clin Case Stud,407,16

To date, no study has synthesized evidence on its role as a prognostic indicator. Thus, the current study aimed to quantitatively assess the prognostic utility of albuminuria as well as dipstick proteinuria in predicting mortality in heart failure patients. Methods: PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, CENTRAL, and Google Scholar databases were searched up to October 10, 2020. All studies reporting multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for albuminuria or dipstick proteinuria for mortality and/or hospitalization in heart failure patients were included. Results: Eleven studies were included. Seven assessed albuminuria and five assessed dipstick proteinuria. Our analysis revealed a statistically significant increased risk of all-cause mortality with microalbuminuria (HR: 1.54; 95% CI, 1.23–1.93; I(2) = 79%; p = 0.0002) and macroalbuminuria (HR: 1.76; 95% CI, 1.21–2.56; I(2) = 88%; p = 0.003) in heart failure patients. The risk of all-cause mortality and hospitalization was also significantly increased with macroalbuminuria. Microalbuminuria was associated with significantly increased cardiovascular mortality and combined cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization. Positive dipstick test for proteinuria was significantly associated with mortality in heart failure (HR: 1.54; 95% CI, 1.28–1.84; I(2) = 67%; p < 0.00001). Conclusion: Both microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria are predictors of mortality in patients with heart failure.

We used British Paediatric Surveillance Unit (BPSU) methodology; collecting data via questionnaires for preterm neonates undergoing PDA ligation (PDAL) between 1st Sept 2012 – 30th Sept 2013. Infants born less than 37 weeks gestation, who underwent PDAL prior to discharge home, with no other structural cardiac abnormality, were included. Information collected included: patient demographics, pre and post-operative clinical characteristics, pre-operative medical management, post-operative complications and outcome. RESULTS: Over the study, 263 infants underwent PDAL an incidence of 3.07 per 10,000 live births. 88% were born extremely preterm (< 28 weeks) and 60% were male. The commonest reasons for ligation were inability to wean respiratory support (83.7%) and haemodynamically significant PDA (87.8%). Pre-operatively 65.7% received medical therapy. Surgery was performed at a median age of 33 days (range 9-260, IQR 24-48); the corrected age was less than 31 + 6 week in 50.6% babies at PDAL. Most, (90%), of procedures were open ligation; only 9 (3.4%) were catheter occlusions (PDACO). 20.5% of patients had post-operative complications. The 30-day mortality was 3%, with 93.5% surviving to hospital discharge. CONCLUSION: This study showed there was little consensus over medical and surgical management of the PDA or timing of surgery.

SUMMARY ANSWER: COVID–19 changed the way in which women sought guidance and accessed services in early pregnancy. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Spontaneous miscarriage is the most common complication of pregnancy1. Experiencing an early pregnancy loss is often an unexpected and difficult time that can be physically traumatising2. A previous study looking at the experience of a miscarriage from both the female and male point of view identified that long waiting times surrounded by other pregnant women in the Emergency Department (ED) was particularly difficult part of the experience2. The COVID–19 pandemic had a significant impact on both hospital and community services. Public health advice also changed the way women accessed healthcare. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Retrospective audit was performed over two six-month periods – July to December 2019 and March to August 2020. Two groups of data were collected; women who contacted the ED with concerns related to early pregnancy (under thirteen weeks gestation) and those who attended the ED with the same complaints. Information was cross referenced to see how many women contacted the ED prior to arrival and what, if any advice was given. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: All women under thirteen weeks gestation with a complaint of bleeding per vaginum (PV) or pain related to early pregnancy who presented to the ED in a large tertiary maternity unit were included in the audit. All women meeting the same criteria who contacted the ED by telephone were also included. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Over the twelve months of data collection, 1274 women had their first visit to the ED. There were 270 further visits within the early pregnancy period recorded for the same cohort of women. Additionally, 1452 phone calls were recorded. There was a 38% (n = 293) decrease in women attending the emergency room in early pregnancy in 2020 during the first wave of COVID–19. There was a 16% (n = 110) increase in women contacting the ED for advice in early pregnancy in the same period in 2020. Women were more like likely to have been referred to the ED by their General Practitioner (GP) (OR 0.62, 95%CI 0.48–0.80) and to have phoned in advance of arrival (OR 1.55, 95%CI 1.17–2.04) in 2020. They were also more likely to have already had a previous ultrasound scan in the current pregnancy (OR 0.64, 95%CI 0.48–0.93). There was a significantly shorter waiting time for an appointment in the early pregnancy clinic in 2020 compared with 2019 (3.5 days versus 2.4 days, p = 0.002). There was no change in the number of women admitted (OR 1.19, 95%CI 0.81–1.74). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Single centre audit. Pregnancies only followed to booking visit/dating scan and outcome noted at that stage. Wider implications of the findings: The COVID–19 pandemic highlighted the need for more education around early pregnancy. Easily accessible information about local early pregnancy services gives women autonomy. Phone triage allowing referral of women to appropriate services, reduces ED visits. Standard training in early pregnancy ultrasound could reduce follow up referrals and admission rates. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Not applicable","Boyd, S; O’Donoghue, K; Meaney, S",Hum Reprod,407,1

These materials have been found to yield promising properties, such as high strength in combination with sufficient ductility as well as high wear and corrosion resistance. Especially for alloys with a body-centered cubic (bcc) structure, advantageous surface properties have been revealed. However, typical HEA systems contain high contents of expensive or scarce elements. Consequently, applying them as coatings where their use is limited to the surface represents an exciting pathway enabling economical exploitation of their superior properties. Nevertheless, processing conditions strongly influence the resulting microstructure and phase formation, which in turn has a considerable effect on the functional properties of HEAs. In the presented study, microstructural differences between high-velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) and high-velocity air fuel (HVAF) sprayed coatings of the alloy AlCrFeCoNi are investigated. A metastable bcc structure is formed in both coating processes. Precipitation reactions are suppressed by the rapid solidification during atomization and by the relatively low thermal input during spraying. The coating resistance to corrosive media was investigated in detail, and an improved passivation behavior was observed in the HVAF coatings.","Löbel, Martin; Lindner, Thomas; Mehner, Thomas; Rymer, Lisa-Marie; Björklund, Stefan; Joshi, Shrikant; Lampke, Thomas",J Therm Spray Tech,407,13

Here we applied a virtual screening approach using Autodock Vina and molecular dynamics simulation in tandem to calculate binding energies for repurposed drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We thereby identified 80 promising compounds with potential activity against SARS-Cov2, consisting of a mixture of antiviral drugs, natural products and drugs with diverse modes of action. A substantial proportion of the top 80 compounds identified in this study had been shown by others to have SARS-CoV-2 antiviral effects in vitro or in vivo, thereby validating our approach. Amongst our top hits not previously reported to have SARS-CoV-2 activity, were eribulin, a macrocyclic ketone analogue of the marine compound halichondrin B and an anticancer drug, the AXL receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor bemcentinib. Our top hits from our RdRp drug screen may not only have utility in treating COVID-19 but may provide a useful starting point for therapeutics against other coronaviruses. Hence, our modelling approach successfully identified multiple drugs with potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.

However the topical drug delivery to the posterior nose and paranasal sinuses shows only limited efficiency. A precise sinusal targeting remains a main challenge for aerosol treatment of sinus disorders. This paper proposes a comparative study of the nasal deposition patterns of micron and submicron particles using planar gamma-scintigraphy imaging vs. a new 3-dimensional (3D) imaging approach based on SPECT-CT measurements. METHODS Radiolabelled nebulizations have been performed on a plastinated model of human nasal cast coupled with a respiratory pump. First, the benefits provided by SPECT-CT imaging were compared with 2D gamma-scintigraphy and radioactive quantification of maxillary sinus lavage as reference for the sonic 2.8 μm aerosol sinusal deposition. Then, the impact on nasal deposition of various airborne particle sizes was assessed. RESULTS The 2D methodology overestimates aerosol deposition in the maxillary sinuses by a factor 9 whereas the 3D methodology is in agreement with the maxillary sinus lavage reference methodology. Then with the SPECT-CT approach we highlighted that the higher particle size was mainly deposited in the central nasal cavity contrary to the submicron aerosol particles (33.8 ± 0.6% of total deposition for the 2.8 μm particles vs. 1 ± 0.3% for the 230 nm particles). CONCLUSION Benefits of SPECT/CT for the assessment of radiolabelled aerosol deposition in rhinology are clearly demonstrated. This 3D methodology should be preferentially used for scintigraphic imaging of sinusal deposition in Human.","Leclerc, Lara; Pourchez, Jérémie; Prevot, Nathalie; Vecellio, Laurent; Le Guellec, Sandrine; Cottier, Michèle; Durand, Marc",International journal of pharmaceutics,407,1

We prove that such a dynamical pattern is compatible with critical susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) dynamics. In traditional analyses of the critical SIR model, the critical dynamical regime is started from a single infected node. The application of containment measures to an ongoing epidemic, however, has the effect to make the system enter in its critical regime with a number of infected individuals potentially large. We describe how such nontrivial starting conditions affect the critical behavior of the SIR model. We perform a theoretical and large-scale numerical investigation of the model. We show that the expected outbreak size is an increasing function of the initial number of infected individuals, while the expected duration of the outbreak is a nonmonotonic function of the initial number of infected individuals. Also, we precisely characterize the magnitude of the fluctuations associated with the size and duration of the outbreak in critical SIR dynamics with nontrivial initial conditions. Far from herd immunity, fluctuations are much larger than average values, thus indicating that predictions of plateauing time series may be particularly challenging.","Radicchi, Filippo; Bianconi, Ginestra",Physical review.

Teleneurology is now being rapidly embraced by neurologists in clinics and hospitals nationwide but for many, this paradigm of care is unfamiliar. Exposure to telemedicine in neurology training programs is scarce despite previous calls to expand teleneurology education. Programs that do provide a teleneurology curriculum have demonstrated increased proficiency, accuracy, and post-training utilization among their trainees. With the current changes in healthcare, broad incorporation of teleneurology education in resident and fellow training after this pandemic dissipates will only serve to improve trainee preparedness for independent practice.The current COVID-19 pandemic is forcing a reckoning of current healthcare delivery and expediting a rapid transition to telemedicine-based care. Even in 2017, the Telemedicine Work Group of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) recommended a teleneurology curriculum as an elective rotation for trainees1 How long ago 2017 seems now as we all hastily work to create operational teleneurology infrastructure in our clinics and hospitals. Although prior exposure in teleneurology is advantageous in tackling the complexities of moving to telehealth-based care, most of the neurology workforce is not formally trained in telemedicine. While we are far from fully understanding the long-term sequelae of this pandemic on our healthcare systems, broader exposure and increased comfort with teleneurology is imperative to prepare our trainees for the new world of medicine they will face after this current pandemic dissipates.","Zha, Alicia M; Chung, Lee S; Song, Shlee S; Majersik, Jennifer J; Jagolino-Cole, Amanda L",Neurology,407,15

The sensitivity and selectivity of stimulation applied to the ear depends on current flow pattern produced by a given electrode montage (size and placement). OBJECTIVE We compare different electrodes designs for taVNS considering both the predicted peak electric fields (sensitivity) and their spatial distribution (selectivity). METHODS Based on optimized high-resolution (0.47 mm) T1 and T2 weighted MRI, we developed an anatomical model of the left ear and the surrounding head tissues including brain, CSF/meninges, skull, muscle, blood vessels, fat, cartilage, and skin. The ear was further segmented into 6 regions of interest (ROI) based on various nerve densities: cavum concha, cymba concha, crus of helix, tragus, antitragus, and earlobe. A range of taVNS electrode montages were reproduced spanning varied electrodes sizes and placements over the tragus, cymba concha, earlobe, cavum concha, and crus of helix. Electric field across the ear (from superficial skin to cartilage) for each montage at 1 mA or 2 mA taVNS, assuming an activation threshold of 6.15 V/m, 12.3 V/m or 24.6 V/m was predicted using a Finite element method (FEM). Finally, considering every ROI, we calculated the sensitivity and selectivity of each montage. RESULTS Current flow patterns through the ear were highly specific to the electrode montage. Electric field was maximal at the ear regions directly under the electrodes, and for a given total current, increases with decreasing electrode size. Depending on the applied current and nerves threshold, activation may also occur in the regions between multiple anterior surface electrodes. Each considered montage was selective for one or two regions of interest. For example, electrodes across the tragus restricted significant electric field to the tragus. Stimulation across the earlobe restricted significant electric field to the earlobe and the antitragus. Because of this relative selectivity, use of control ear montages in experimental studies, support testing of targeting. Relative targeting was robust across assumptions of activation threshold and tissue properties. DISCUSSION Computational models provide additional insight on how details in electrode shape and placement impact sensitivity (how much current is needed) and selectivity (spatial distribution), thereby supporting analysis of existing approaches and optimization of new devices. Our result suggest taVNS current patterns and relative target are robust across individuals, though (variance in) axon morphology was not represented.","Kreisberg, Erica; Esmaeilpour, Zeinab; Adair, Devin; Khadka, Niranjan; Datta, Abhishek; Badran, Bashar W; Bremner, J Douglas; Bikson, Marom",Brain stimulation,407,5

The risk of concomitant bacterial infection in febrile infants positive for human rhinovirus (HRV) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is unknown. METHODS Infants 1-90 days old managed using the care process model for well-appearing febrile infants and with respiratory viral testing by PCR (RVPCR) in the emergency department or inpatient setting of 22 hospitals in the Intermountain Healthcare system from 2007-2016 were identified. Relative risk (RR) of bacterial infection was calculated for infants with HRV, non-HRV viruses, or no virus detected. RESULTS Of 10 964 febrile infants identified, 4037 (37%) had RVPCR. Of these, 2212 (55%) were positive for a respiratory virus; 1392 (35%) for HRV alone. Bacterial infection was identified in 9.5%. Febrile infants with HRV detected were more likely to have bacterial infection than those with non-HRV viruses (7.8% vs 3.7%; P < .001; RR 2.12 [95% CI 1.43-3.15]). Risk of urinary tract infection was not significantly different for HRV-positive infants at any age, nor was risk of invasive bacterial infection (IBI; bacteremia and/or meningitis) meaningfully different for infants 1-28 day olds.

However, urine leakage is a common problem with an indwelling urinary catheter. This study aims to determine whether a modified catheterisation technique would reduce urine leakage incidence. METHODS Participants were randomly divided into conventional or modified catheterisation groups. In the modified technique group, the volume of fluid that needed to be injected into the balloon to obtain a suitable catheter front-end curvature (120-145°) was measured before catheterisation. Baseline characteristics and first-time success rates and procedure durations were similar between groups. RESULTS There were 30 patients in each group. Compared with conventional catheterisation, the modified catheterisation group had smaller residual urine volume (median 11 mL Vs. 30.5 mL, p<0.001) and more leakage-free days (30 days Vs. 10 days, p<0.001). Leakage-free survival was longer in the modified catheterisation group (p<0.001).

Pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable and experience high levels of distress during an infectious disease outbreak. The aim of this study was to determine anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS This cross-sectional study surveyed a total of 283 pregnant women within the period of May 11 to May 28,2020. During their regular antenatal visit, pregnant women were invited to participate in the study. The self-created personal information form was used to assess the main characteristics of the participants. Anxiety and PTSD symptoms of the pregnant women were measured by the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), respectively. RESULTS The mean age of the pregnant women was 29.20±5.55 years. Regarding gestational age, 72 (25.4%), 86 (30.4) and 125 (44.2) were in the first, second and third trimesters, respectively. The mean gestational age was 23.82±11.05 weeks. The mean STAI-S and STAI-T scores were 39.52±10.56 within the cut-off value (39-40) of the instrument and 42.74±8.33, respectively. Furthermore, the mean total IES-R score was 36.60±15.65 within the cut-off value (24) of the instrument. Multiple regression analysis revealed that pregnancy complication (p=0.01) and employment status of husband (p=0.04) were the best predictors of state anxiety. Additionally, the presence of COVID-19-related symptoms (p=0.01) and educational level (p=0.01) were found to predict PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Pregnant women would be likely to experience high levels of anxiety and PTSD symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic's delay phase.

We aimed to assess and extend the psychometric properties of the ItchyQoL using classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT). METHODS Item characteristic curves (ICCs) were analysed in order to see whether the response categories are functioning optimally. Confirmatory factor analyses were carried out on the ItchyQoL prior to and after rescoring of the response categories. We conducted a Rasch analysis on the ItchyQoL with revised response options and assessed the mean fit residuals as well as the assumptions of unidimensionality and local independence. RESULTS Five hundred and fifty-one patients with CP from nine European countries completed the 22 items of the ItchyQoL. IRT analysis supported the revision of response options from five to three. This revision was supported by excellent structural validity using CTT. The overall fit to the Rasch model was adequate. Unidimensionality was supported by the ItchyQoL overall scale as well as by the single subscales, however local independence was violated in eight cases. CONCLUSION We suggest a revision of the response categories of the ItchyQoL from a 5-point to a 3-point scale. Applying this revision, the ItchyQoL showed excellent structural validity according to CTT and IRT/Rasch. The calculation of an overall ItchyQoL sum score is allowed.","Gabes, M; Zeidler, C; Ständer, S; Chen, S C; Apfelbacher, C J",The British journal of dermatology,407,31

In severe cases, it affects intraoperative renal arterial anastomosis and increases the risk of postanastomosis complications. At present, safe and efficient vascular replacement methods are relatively limited. In the 2 renal transplant cases at our center, described here, the donors' iliac arteries were unavailable. We therefore attempted to replace the recipients' diseased external iliac artery with the donors' inferior vena cava and then performed an end-to-side grafting with the attachment in arterial reconstruction. One patient received a single kidney transplantation, while the other received a dual kidney transplantation. Antiplatelet/anticoagulation drug application was avoided, and both patients were observed for more than 6 months. Stable renal graft function was achieved without any vascular complications. During this study, all procedures were in compliance with the Helsinki Congress and the Declaration of Istanbul. For end-stage renal disease patients with severe iliac atherosclerosis who are waiting for kidney transplantation, a donor's vena cava graft could potentially be a promising replacement option to restore external iliac artery patency and reconstruct renal blood flow, without the necessity of harvesting a recipient's autologous vessels or looking for costly artificial ones.","Xie, Liangbo; Zeng, Xianpeng; Xia, Qiuxiang; Peng, Jingtao; Liu, Fangning; Chen, Jing; Liu, Jiali; Xiao, Xiong; Liu, Jing; Li, Heng; Wang, Zhendi",Transplantation proceedings,407,1

Although these systems are virtually ubiquitous, they are infrequently used in anesthesiology because of the complexity of physiologic systems and the difficulty in obtaining reliable and valid feedback data from the patient. Despite these challenges, closed-loop systems are being increasingly studied and improved for medical use. Two recent developments have made fluid administration a candidate for closed-loop control. First, the further description and development of dynamic predictors of fluid responsiveness provides a strong parameter for use as a control variable to guide fluid administration. Second, rapid advances in noninvasive monitoring of cardiac output and other hemodynamic variables make goal-directed therapy applicable for a wide range of patients in a variety of clinical care settings. In this article, we review the history of closed-loop controllers in clinical care, discuss the current understanding and limitations of the dynamic predictors of fluid responsiveness, and examine how these variables might be incorporated into a closed-loop fluid administration system.","Rinehart, Joseph; Liu, Ngai; Alexander, Brenton; Cannesson, Maxime",Anesthesia and analgesia,407,28

METHODS MR CLEAN was a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial of intra-arterial therapy (IAT) vs no IAT. The intended anesthetic management at the start of the procedure was used for this post hoc analysis. The primary effect parameter was the adjusted common odds ratio (acOR) for a shift in direction of a better outcome on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days, estimated with multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis, which included a term for general anesthesia (GA). RESULTS GA was associated with significant (p = 0.011) effect modification, resulting in estimated decrease of 51% (95% confidence interval [CI] 31%-86%) in treatment effect compared to non-GA. We found a shift in the distribution on the mRS in favor of non-GA compared to control group (acOR 2.18 [95% CI 1.49-3.20]). The shift in distribution between GA and control group was in a similar direction (acOR 1.12 [95% CI 0.71-1.78]) with loss of statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS In this post hoc analysis, we found that the type of anesthetic management influences outcome following IAT. Only treatment without general anesthesia was associated with a significant treatment benefit in MR CLEAN. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This study provides Class II evidence that for patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing IAT, mRS scores at 90 days improve only in patients treated without GA.","Berkhemer, Olvert A; van den Berg, Lucie A; Fransen, Puck S S; Beumer, Debbie; Yoo, Albert J; Lingsma, Hester F; Schonewille, Wouter J; van den Berg, René; Wermer, Marieke J H; Boiten, Jelis; Lycklama À Nijeholt, Geert J; Nederkoorn, Paul J; Hollmann, Markus W; van Zwam, Wim H; van der Lugt, Aad; van Oostenbrugge, Robert J; Majoie, Charles B L M; Dippel, Diederik W J; Roos, Yvo B W E M",Neurology,407,12

However, the practical use of cytokines in livestock is not evident due to cost and production issues associated with mass administration. In this study, we tested the efficacy of live attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium designed to secrete swine IFN-alpha (swIFN-alpha) protein for preventing the clinical signs caused by infection with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), one of the diarrhea-causing viruses in the swine industry. Attenuated Salmonella vaccine (chi8501) containing swIFN-alpha-encoding pYA3560 vector (chi8501/swIFN-alpha) successfully induced the secretion of swIFN-alpha protein into the culture supernatants, as confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The culture supernatants of chi8501/swIFN-alpha had antiviral activity against TGEV with 50% effective dose (ED(50)) of 320 per mg of supernatant protein. In addition, oral administration of chi8501/swIFN-alpha reduced the severity of clinical signs caused by TGEV infection with the effect more apparent at 6-8 days post-infection, and reduced excretion of TGEV in feces. Similarly, the amount of TGEV in intestinal tissues and mesenteric lymph node of chi8501/swIFN-alpha-administered piglets was lower than in piglets that were treated with control bacteria. These results indicate the value of attenuated Salmonella vaccines as delivery systems of cytokines that can be used for mass administration, thereby overcoming cost and production issues.","Kim, Seon Ju; Han, Young Woo; Rahman, Md Masudur; Kim, Seong Bum; Uyangaa, Erdenebileg; Lee, Byung Min; Kim, Jin Hyoung; Roh, Yoon Seok; Kang, Seong Ho; Kim, Koanhoi; Lee, John Hwa; Kim, Bumseok; Park, Ki In; Eo, Seong Kug",Vaccine,407,1

METHODS A 3-month pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare the mobile interventionist approach as an add-on to assertive community treatment (ACT) versus ACT alone. Participants were 49 individuals with serious mental illness (62% with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder, 24% with bipolar disorder, and 14% with depression). Clinical outcomes were evaluated at baseline, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up, and satisfaction was evaluated posttreatment. RESULTS The intervention appeared feasible (95% of participants assigned to the mobile interventionist arm initiated the intervention, texting on 69% of possible days and averaging four messages per day), acceptable (91% reported satisfaction), and safe (no adverse events reported). Exploratory posttreatment clinical effect estimations suggested greater reductions in the severity of paranoid thoughts (Cohen's d=-0.61) and depression (d=-0.59) and improved illness management (d=0.31) and recovery (d=0.23) in the mobile interventionist group. CONCLUSIONS Augmentation of care with a texting mobile interventionist proved to be feasible, acceptable, safe, and clinically promising. The findings are encouraging given the relative ease of training practitioners to serve as mobile interventionists, the low burden placed on patients and practitioners, and the simplicity of the technology. The technical resources are widely accessible to patients and practitioners, boding well for potential intervention scalability. When pandemics such as COVID-19 block the possibility of in-person patient-provider contact, evidence-based texting interventions can serve a crucial role in supporting continuity of care.","Ben-Zeev, Dror; Buck, Benjamin; Meller, Suzanne; Hudenko, William J; Hallgren, Kevin A",Psychiatric services,407,16

Despite performing various methods for preventing postoperative recurrence, it remains relatively high. Although considering the margin distance of bullectomy is important, no argument has been discussed for the optical margin distance until now. Hence, we evaluated the optimal margin distance for bullectomy of spontaneous pneumothorax, bullectomy to reduce postoperative recurrence. Methods Between March 2015 and May 2018, 91 eligible candidates from 142 cases, who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic bullectomy for spontaneous pneumothorax, bullectomy, were evaluated. We analysed the factors preventing postoperative recurrence, including the margin distance using the inverse-probability of treatment weighted method by propensity score was used to adjust for heterogeneous patient backgrounds. Results The patients' median age was 20 years (range, 14-86 years). Postoperative recurrences occurred in 8 cases (8.8%). The margin distance was 9.1±5.0 mm. The cut-off point of the margin distance was defined as 5.0 mm. The inverse-probability of treatment weighted method indicated that a margin distance ≥5.0 mm significantly prevented postoperative recurrence (P=0.0076, hazard ratio =0.18). Conclusions This study suggests that a margin distance of ≥5.0 mm for bullectomy of PSP can reduce postoperative recurrence.","Tsuboshima, Kenji; Matoba, Yasumi; Wakahara, Teppei",Journal of thoracic disease,407,24

Liver volumes can be calculated routinely using the time-consuming gold standard method of manual volumetry. The current work sought to evaluate an alternative automatic technique based on a novel 3D virtual planning software, and to compare it to the manual technique. METHODS A prospective study of patients undergoing liver resection was conducted. Every patient had a pre and 2-day postoperative CT-scan. For each patient, total, remnant and resected volumes were calculated manually and automatically. Planes of resection were verified by a hepatobiliary surgeon and compared with postoperative volumes. Paired t-tests and correlation coefficients were calculated. RESULTS A major hepatectomy was carried out in 36/43 patients. The automatic TLV (1,759 mL) and the manual TLV (1,832 mL) were significantly different (p < 0.001), but extremely highly correlated (r = 0.989). The percentages of preoperative RLV (manual 58.5%, automatic 58.9%) were similar, with an excellent correlation of 0.917. The preoperative RLV were matched with the 2-day postoperative RLV showing a significant difference (p = 0.0301). The resected volumes using both techniques (871 and 832 mL) were compared with the resected specimen volume (670 mL), showing a significant difference (p < 0.001) but a high degree of correlation (r = 0.874). CONCLUSION The 3D virtual surgical planning software is accurate and reliable in determining the total liver and future remnant liver volumes. This technique demonstrates a good correlation with the manual technique. Future work will be required to confirm these findings and to evaluate the clinical value of the three-dimensional planning platform.","Bégin, André; Martel, Guillaume; Lapointe, Réal; Belblidia, Assia; Lepanto, Luigi; Soler, Luc; Mutter, Didier; Marescaux, Jacques; Vandenbroucke-Menu, Franck",Surgical endoscopy,407,16

However, due to high prevalence rates of trauma-related mental disorders in this region, it is important to scale up existing Internet-based interventions in order to increase the number of clients. Objective The aim of the study was to examine whether a brief Internet-based intervention with one cognitive technique (TF-short, 6 assignments) results in the same PTSD symptom change and lower dropouts compared to a longer intervention with two cognitive techniques (TF-reg, 10 assignments). Method A total of 224 Arab participants (67.4% female; M = 25.3 years old) with PTSD were randomly assigned to Internet-based CBT with either a TF-reg protocol (n = 110) or a TF-short protocol (n = 114). Symptoms of PTSD and secondary outcomes (anxiety, depression, somatic complaints, quality of life) were self-assessed online at baseline and post-treatment. Treatment-associated changes were estimated using multigroup latent difference score models. Results The overall PTSD score assessed with the PDS decreased by about 15 points in both conditions. The between-group differences (TF-reg vs. TF-short) at post-assessment were non-significant, Δ = 0.29, p = .896, d = 0.02, 95% CI [-0.30, 0.34]. Like the primary outcome, all within-group changes for the secondary outcomes throughout the intervention were statistically significant and all between-group effects were non-significant. Overall, the dropout rates did not differ between the two conditions, χ2 (1/N = 175) = 0.83, p = .364. Conclusions The findings suggest that the shorter condition results in the same symptom change and dropout rate as the longer condition.

As a result, more patients with pulmonary nodules, many with subcentimeter lesions, are being referred to thoracic surgeons, some with concern for primary lung neoplasm and others with possible metastatic lung lesions. Obtaining a definitive diagnosis of these lesions is difficult. Electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB)-guided pleural dye marking followed by thoracoscopic resection is a novel alternative technique for definitive diagnosis. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and our initial experience with ENB-guided dye localization and minimally invasive resection for diagnosis of lung lesions. METHODS Selected patients with lung lesions underwent ENB-guided dye marking and minimally invasive resection. The primary end points were the rate of nodule localization and definitive diagnosis of the nodule. RESULTS We performed ENB-guided localization and minimally invasive resection in 29 patients. The median lesion size was 10 mm, with a median distance from pleural surface of 13 mm. The operative mortality was 0%. The median hospital stay was 3 days. The nodule was localized and resected, and a definitive diagnosis was obtained in all patients (29 of 29; 100%). The nodule was neoplastic in 19 patients. All malignant lesions were completely resected with negative microscopic margins. CONCLUSIONS Our initial experience with ENB-guided dye localization and minimally invasive resection found that the technique was feasible, safe, and successful in the diagnosis of small lung lesions. Thoracic surgeons should further investigate this method and incorporate it into their armamentarium.","Awais, Omar; Reidy, Michael R; Mehta, Kunal; Bianco, Valentino; Gooding, William E; Schuchert, Matthew J; Luketich, James D; Pennathur, Arjun",The Annals of thoracic surgery,407,1

In the present times, where social and professional communications are becoming unavoidable, halitosis has become a concern of growing importance. Oral malodor mostly develops due to the putrefaction of substrates by the indigenous bacterial populations. Although culture-based studies have provided adequate information on halitosis, the high throughput omics technologies have amplified the resolution at which oral microbial community can be examined and has led to the detection of a broader range of taxa associated with intra-oral halitosis (IOH). These microorganisms are regulated by the interactions of their ecological processes. Thus to develop effective treatment strategies, it is important to understand the microbial basis of halitosis. In the current review, we provide an update on IOH in context to the role of the oral microbiome, metabolic pathways involved, and novel diagnostic tools, including breathomics. Understanding oral microbiota associated with halitosis from a broader ecological perspective can provide novel insights into one's oral and systemic health. Such information can pave the way for the emergence of diagnostic tools that can revolutionize the early detection of halitosis and various associated medical conditions.","Foo, Lean Heong; Balan, Preethi; Pang, Li Mei; Laine, Marja L; Seneviratne, Chaminda Jayampath",Critical reviews in microbiology,407,29

The sample group included 29 patients who were admitted to our Covid-19 Centre who died during hospitalisation and the autopsy staff. All the swabs were subjected to a one-step real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction with cycle threshold (Ct) values. Swab collection was performed at 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 12 h, over 24 since death.

There are no trials on the efficacy of inhaled beta2 -agonist in this clinical scenario. OBJECTIVE To study post hoc the short-term (up to 2 months) efficacy of inhaled beta2 -agonist with and without oral corticosteroid in the first acute rhinovirus-induced severe wheezing episode in young hospitalized children. METHODS The study population came from two randomized controlled trials comparing oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg/d for 3 days) to placebo: Vinku (n=35, NCT00494624) used high-dose regular nebulized salbutamol (0.15 mg/kg 2 h - 4 h intervals) and Vinku2 (n=60, NCT00731575, EudraCT 2006-007100-42) used inhaled salbutamol on-demand. Both studies used identical detailed follow-up assessments. The primary outcome of the former was the duration of hospitalization and of the latter the occurrence of and the time to a new physician-confirmed wheezing episode within 2 months after discharge. Treatment groups included salbutamol high-dose vs. salbutamol on-demand while adjusting for prednisolone status and acknowledging for interactions with exception of the duration of hospitalization in which prednisolone groups could not be fully used due to protocol differences. RESULTS Median age of subjects was 13 months, 32% were sensitized and 22% had doctor-diagnosed eczema. In the duration of hospitalization, salbutamol high-dose/placebo vs salbutamol on-demand/placebo groups did not differ (P = .12). In the occurrence of and time to relapse within 2 months, a significant group×treatment interaction was observed (both P = .02), such that high-dose group had less and longer time to relapses than on-demand group in prednisolone arm (both P < .05), but no difference was detected in placebo arm (both P > .26). CONCLUSIONS In young, hospitalized children with first episode of rhinovirus-induced wheezing, high-dose inhaled salbutamol may interact with oral prednisolone. However, further trials are warranted.","Hurme, Pekka; Homil, Kiara; Lehtinen, Pasi; Turunen, Riitta; Vahlberg, Tero; Vuorinen, Tytti; Camargo, Carlos A; Gern, James E; Jartti, Tuomas",Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,407,19

In this paper, we analyze the emergence and large-scale expansion of a community-based environmental protection system (the Voluntary Environmental Agents Program - VEA Program) in the Brazilian Amazon and identify factors that have determined its success since its inception, 25 years ago. Collective actions to protect the environment in the region have been undertaken by local people for at least 40 years, before their legal regulation in 2001 by the federal government of Brazil, and by the Amazonas state in 2007. The system is based on territorial surveillance and monitoring, and on guidelines for the better use of the territory and its natural resources. Between 1995 and 2020, the VEA Program expanded into the two protected areas where it was first implemented reaching approximately 9 thousand km2 of area protected by the system. The number of people participating also grew in this period by around 2050%, as did the participation of women, which grew by 5600%. The system was replicated in 37 protected areas in central Amazonia, and currently covers almost 200 thousand km2 of Amazon rainforest. From our analyses we unveil four main factors that may have allowed the VEA Program to expand and flourish: (a) the communities' previous demand for an effective control system, (b) its legal formalization and regulation, (c) the support from external institutions, and (d) the consolidation of community-based management programs to fund actions. These factors shall be further investigated as to confirm their critical role in the success of the VEA Program. We demonstrate that this community-based environmental protection system has established itself as a legitimate form of social control, and as a mechanism of socio-environmental governance in the areas in which it operates. By allowing more effective protection of territories, it generates consensus amongst users for the adequate management of natural resources, especially in contexts where government's actions are absent or inefficient. We claim that this system can be replicated in various parts of the world.","Franco, Caetano L B; El Bizri, Hani R; Souza, Paulo Roberto E; Fa, Julia E; Valsecchi, João; Sousa, Isabel Soares de; Queiroz, Helder Lima de",Journal of environmental management,407,8

The current pandemic of COVID19 disease involves severe risks for the healthcare provider involved in initiating invasive ventilation for ARDS patients. Medical staff gets infected every day and a lot of colleagues already died due to the novel disease. As surface contamination is one of the common ways involved in disease spreading, the stethoscope, a ubiquity tool that needs to be in contact with both infected patient and the cephalic extremity of the health care practitioner may have a key role. Auscultation of both lungs with the stethoscope to differentiate between tracheal and bronchial intubation is still the standard of care in all the intubation protocols all around the world. The preoccupation to include the ultrasound as a tool for airway management is not new (Garg 2015) and ultrasound was showed to have better sensibility and specificity than auscultation (Ramsingh et al. 2016).","Dîrzu, Dan Sebastian",International journal of clinical practice,407,27

In this study, a novel bat adenovirus (AdV) (BtAdV-TJM) was isolated from bat fecal samples by using a bat primary kidney cell line. Infection studies indicated that most animal and human cell lines are susceptible to BtAdV-TJM, suggesting a possible wide host range. Genome analysis revealed 30 putative genes encoding proteins homologous to their counterparts in most known AdVs. Phylogenetic analysis placed BtAdV-TJM within the genus Mastadenovirus, most closely related to tree shrew and canine AdVs. PCR analysis of 350 bat fecal samples, collected from 19 species in five Chinese provinces during 2007 and 2008, indicated that 28 (or 8%) samples were positive for AdVs. The samples were from five bat species, Hipposideros armiger, Myotis horsfieldii, M. ricketti, Myotis spp., and Scotophilus kuhlii. The prevalence ranged from 6.25% (H. armiger in 2007) to 40% (M. ricketti in 2007). Comparison studies based on available partial sequences of the pol gene demonstrated a great genetic diversity among bat AdVs infecting different bat species as well as those infecting the same bat species. This is the first report of a genetically diverse group of DNA viruses in bats. Our results support the notion, derived from previous studies based on RNA viruses (especially coronaviruses and astroviruses), that bats seem to have the unusual ability to harbor a large number of genetically diverse viruses within a geographic location and/or within a taxonomic group.","Li, Yan; Ge, Xingyi; Zhang, Huajun; Zhou, Peng; Zhu, Yan; Zhang, Yunzhi; Yuan, Junfa; Wang, Lin-Fa; Shi, Zhengli",Journal of virology,407,1

However, the tumor cell yields and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression between each approach have not been compared. Here, we assessed the tumor cell numbers and PD-L1 expression for Cryo with EBUS-GS for PPLs and TBB in patients with lung cancer. METHODS Sixteen patients were enrolled in this prospective study from June to November 2017 at Tokyo Women's Medical University Hospital. The number of tumor cells from a single biopsy, total number of tumor cells, average number of tumor cells, and 22C3 PD-L1 expression (≥ 50% and ≥ 1%) were compared between Cryo and TBB. RESULTS The numbers of tumor cells from a single biopsy, total numbers of tumor cells, and average numbers of tumor cells obtained by Cryo were significantly larger than those obtained by TBB (Cryo [means ± standard errors of the means]: 1321 ± 303.7, 1981 ± 411.7, and 1406 ± 310.3; TBB: 208.8 ± 38.24, 1044 ± 189.0, and 208.8 ± 37.81; P < 0.0001, P = 0.0474, P = 0.0006, respectively). PD-L1 ≥ 50% and ≥ 1% patients for Cryo were 18.8 and 56.3%, respectively, whereas those for TBB were 12.5 and 37.5%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, concordance, and κ coefficient based on Cryo for TBB were 66.7, 100, 100, 92.9, 93.8%, and 0.7647, respectively, for PD-L1 ≥ 50%; and 44.4, 71.4, 66.7, 50, 56.3%, and 0.1515, respectively, for PD-L1 ≥ 1%. CONCLUSION Cryo with EBUS-GS may be a useful diagnostic approach for lung cancer, with advantages over TBB for gene analysis and whole exon sequencing. Particularly, it could contribute to patients taking pembrolizumab as first-line therapy when PD-L1 was negative by evaluating TBB specimens. It could also provide ample tissue for PD-L1 expression analysis in addition to accurate diagnosis and gene analysis.","Arimura, Ken; Kondo, Mitsuko; Nagashima, Yoji; Kanzaki, Masato; Kobayashi, Fumi; Takeyama, Kiyoshi; Tamaoki, Jun; Tagaya, Etsuko",Respiratory research,407,16

Therefore, the characterization of Cx43-interacting proteins and their dynamics is important to understand not only the molecular mechanisms underlying pathological malfunction of gap junction-mediated intercellular communication but also to identify novel and unanticipated biological functions of Cx43. In the present study, we observed potential targets of Cx43 to determine new molecular functions in cardio-protection. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of Cx43 co-immunoprecipitated proteins showed that Cx43 interacts with several proteins related to metabolism. In GeneMANIA network analysis, SGSM3, which has not been previously associated with Cx43, was highly correlated with Cx43 in heart functions, and high levels of SGSM3 appeared to induce the turnover of Cx43 through lysosomal degradation in myocardial infarcted rat hearts. Moreover, we confirmed that lysosomal degradation of Cx43 is dependent upon the interaction between SGSM3 and Cx43 in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. The functional importance of the interaction between SGSM3 and Cx43 was confirmed by results showing that Cx43 expression was enhanced by SGSM3 siRNA knockdown in H9c2 cells. In summary, the results of this study elucidate the molecular mechanisms in which Cx43 with SGSM3 is degraded in myocardial infarcted rat hearts, which may contribute to the establishment of new therapeutic targets to modulate cardiac function in physiological and pathological conditions.","Lee, Chang Youn; Choi, Jung-Won; Shin, Sunhye; Lee, Jiyun; Seo, Hyang-Hee; Lim, Soyeon; Lee, Seahyoung; Joo, Hyun-Chul; Kim, Sang Woo; Hwang, Ki-Chul",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,407,31

Both qualitative and quantitative studies have examined the benefits of the activity but very few have examined the effects when someone loses access to it and stops singing. OBJECTIVES Examining the governmental and organisational responses precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, we asked what happens when a choir singer loses all of their routines associated with regular participation in choir singing. MATERIALS AND METHODS One national choir organization in Sweden (n = 3163) and one in Norway (n = 1881) were approached with a short survey. This comprised questions relating to the issue ""what do you as a choir singer misses the most?"" Each participant was asked to rate the importance of a number of elements that pertain to the experience of choir singing. RESULTS The social aspect of singing emerged as having the strongest weight in terms of perceived loss that is, it was the element that the participants missed the most. Professional singers report that they miss the aesthetic experiences, flow, and all the physical aspects (physical training, voice training, and breathing training) to a greater degree as compared to reports from the amateurs. The importance of aesthetic experiences and physical components appeared to rise with increasing number of years that an individual had engaged with choir singing. CONCLUSION In the Scandinavian setting, the social aspect has a stronger weight than the other components and this seemed to be more significant in Norway compared to Sweden.","Theorell, Töres; Kowalski, Jan; Theorell, Ann Mari Lind; Horwitz, Eva Bojner",Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation,407,1

The operating and management conditions for water reclamation plants in China have been changed since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in China at the end of 2019 to prevent emerging viruses being spread through wastewater treatment processes and the reclaimed water that is produced. Removal of pathogens and trace organic compounds (e.g., pharmaceuticals and personal care products and endocrine disrupting chemicals) in a real water reclamation plant after the start of COVID-19 epidemic was studied. Disinfection byproduct formation caused by chlorine being added to meet disinfection requirements was also assessed. The pathogenic microorganism concentrations in effluent were <2 (most probable number)/L, and the removal rates for most trace organic compounds were >80% when advanced treatments were performed using ozone, ultraviolet light, and chlorine doses of 2 mg/L, 20.5 mJ/cm2, and 2-3 mg/L, respectively. The main disinfection byproduct produced at a chlorine dose of 2 mg/L and a residence time of 1 h was chloroform (at concentrations <15 μg/L).

However, the risk of major stroke is very high for only the first few days after TIA and minor ischaemic stroke, and observational studies show substantially greater benefits of early medical treatment in the acute phase than do longer-term trials. We hypothesised that the short-term benefits of early aspirin have been underestimated. METHODS Pooling the individual patient data from all randomised trials of aspirin versus control in secondary prevention after TIA or ischaemic stroke, we studied the effects of aspirin on the risk and severity of recurrent stroke, stratified by the following time periods: less than 6 weeks, 6-12 weeks, and more than 12 weeks after randomisation. We compared the severity of early recurrent strokes between treatment groups with shift analysis of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. To understand possible mechanisms of action, we also studied the time course of the interaction between effects of aspirin and dipyridamole in secondary prevention of stroke. In a further analysis we pooled data from trials of aspirin versus control in which patients were randomised less than 48 h after major acute stroke, stratified by severity of baseline neurological deficit, to establish the very early time course of the effect of aspirin on risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke and how this differs by severity at baseline. FINDINGS We pooled data for 15,778 participants from 12 trials of aspirin versus control in secondary prevention. Aspirin reduced the 6 week risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke by about 60% (84 of 8452 participants in the aspirin group had an ischaemic stroke vs 175 of 7326; hazard ratio [HR] 0·42, 95% CI 0·32-0·55, p<0·0001) and disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke by about 70% (36 of 8452 vs 110 of 7326; 0·29, 0·20-0·42, p<0·0001), with greatest benefit noted in patients presenting with TIA or minor stroke (at 0-2 weeks, two of 6691 participants in the aspirin group with TIA or minor stroke had a disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke vs 23 of 5726 in the control group, HR 0·07, 95% CI 0·02-0·31, p=0·0004; at 0-6 weeks, 14 vs 60 participants, 0·19, 0·11-0·34, p<0·0001). The effect of aspirin on early recurrent ischaemic stroke was due partly to a substantial reduction in severity (mRS shift analysis odds ratio [OR] 0·42, 0·26-0·70, p=0·0007). These effects were independent of dose, patient characteristics, or aetiology of TIA or stroke. Some further reduction in risk of ischaemic stroke accrued for aspirin only versus control from 6-12 weeks, but there was no benefit after 12 weeks (stroke risk OR 0·97, 0·84-1·12, p=0·67; severity mRS shift OR 1·00, 0·77-1·29, p=0·97). By contrast, dipyridamole plus aspirin versus aspirin alone had no effect on risk or severity of recurrent ischaemic stroke within 12 weeks (OR 0·90, 95% CI 0·65-1·25, p=0·53; mRS shift OR 0·90, 0·37-1·72, p=0·99), but dipyridamole did reduce risk thereafter (0·76, 0·63-0·92, p=0·005), particularly of disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke (0·64, 0·49-0·84, p=0·0010). We pooled data for 40,531 participants from three trials of aspirin versus control in major acute stroke. The reduction in risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke at 14 days was most evident in patients with less severe baseline deficits, and was substantial by the second day after starting treatment (2-3 day HR 0·37, 95% CI 0·25-0·57, p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION Our findings confirm that medical treatment substantially reduces the risk of early recurrent stroke after TIA and minor stroke and identify aspirin as the key intervention. The considerable early benefit from aspirin warrants public education about self-administration after possible TIA. The previously unrecognised effect of aspirin on severity of early recurrent stroke, the diminishing benefit with longer-term use, and the contrasting time course of effects of dipyridamole have implications for understanding mechanisms of action.

METHODS An exploratory qualitative study approach was used. Semi-structured questions were devised and used to elicit data on the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on women accessing treatment for HIV. Twenty women were interviewed through contacts from community and faith organizations in peri-urban Harare. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and entered into NVivo to make analysis easy. The data were thematically analyzed, underpinned by the four phases of data analysis in the Silences Framework. RESULTS The study discovered that transport problems, confusing COVID-19 restrictions, abuse by police and soldiers at roadblocks, a shortage of medication, lack of health check-up routines, involuntary default of ART, and a shortage of personal protective equipment affected HIV-positive women accessing ART during the COVID-19 lockdown. CONCLUSION People living with HIV need a robust supporting environment and a functioning health system. In response to COVID-19 all services were halted to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

We review four classes of acts of receptiveness: conveying uncertainty, acknowledging mistakes, highlighting drawbacks, and asking questions. We identify conditions under which and mechanisms through which these actions boost persuasion. Acts of receptiveness appear to be more persuasive when they come from expert or high-status sources, rather than non-expert or low-status sources, and to operate through two primary mechanisms: increased involvement and enhanced source perceptions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A tumor ablation database was retrospectively reviewed for sternal cryoablation procedures performed between January 2005 and June 2013, which yielded 15 procedures to treat 12 sternal metastases in 12 patients (five men). Median patient age was 57 years (range, 38-80 y). Metastases arose from five primary sites (breast, lung, kidney, ampulla, and thyroid), and median tumor size was 3.8 cm (range, 2.2-7.5 cm). Seven patients (58%) underwent cryoablation for pain palliation, and five (42%) underwent cryoablation for local tumor control of oligometastatic disease. Clinical outcomes (including complications, local tumor control, and pain response) were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS Mean pain scores decreased from 7.0 ± 1.9 (median, 7; range, 4-10) at baseline to 1.8 ± 1.2 (median, 1.5; range, 0-4) following cryoablation (P = .00049). Two patients had durable pain palliation, and four had greater than 1 month of pain relief, with a median duration of 5.7 months (range, 1.5-14.7 mo). Two patients in whom recurrent pain developed underwent repeat cryoablation, with durable pain relief. Allowing for a single repeat treatment, local tumor control was achieved in four of five patients (80%) treated for this indication, with median follow-up of 8.4 months (range, 2.6-13.6 mo). In one patient (8%), an infectious complication developed that was successfully treated with antibiotics on an outpatient basis. CONCLUSIONS Cryoablation is a safe and potentially effective treatment for patients with painful sternal metastases and can achieve local tumor control in select patients.","Hegg, Ryan M; Kurup, Anil Nicholas; Schmit, Grant D; Weisbrod, Adam J; Atwell, Thomas D; Olivier, Kenneth R; Moynihan, Timothy J; Callstrom, Matthew R",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,407,28

Our aim was to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children. METHODS PUBMED and EMBASE were searched through June 20, 2020, for case reports and case series reporting pediatric COVID-19 cases. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were collected and analyzed to compare by age. RESULTS Our search identified 46 eligible case reports and case series. A total of 114 pediatric cases with COVID-19 were included. The main clinical features were mild symptoms including fever (64%), cough (35%), and rhinorrhea (16%), or no symptoms (15%). Ground-like opacities were common radiological findings (54%). The main laboratory findings were lymphopenia (33%) and elevated D-dimer (52%) and C-reactive protein (40%) levels. We identified 17 patients (15%) with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) manifesting with symptoms overlapping with, but distinct from, Kawasaki disease, including gastrointestinal symptoms, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, shock, and marked elevated inflammatory biomarkers. Twelve percent of the patients including 65% of the MIS-C cases required intensive care because of hypotension. No deaths were reported. CONCLUSION This systematic review found that children with COVID-19 are generally less severe or asymptomatic. However, infants might be seriously ill and older children might develop MIS-C with severe illness.

The correct execution of physical activity is crucial both in sports as well as disease prevention and rehabilitation. Little to no automated commodity solutions for automated analysis and feedback exist. OBJECTIVES Validation of the Apple ARKit framework as a solution for automatic body tracking in daily physical exercises using the smartphones' built-in camera. METHODS We deliver insights into ARKit's body tracking accuracy through a lab experiment against the VICON system as Gold Standard. We provide further insights through case studies using apps built on ARKit. RESULTS ARKit exposes significant limitations in tracking the full range of motion in joints but accurately tracks the movement itself. Case studies show that applying it to measure the quantity of execution of exercises is possible. CONCLUSION ARKit is a light-weight commodity solution for quantitative assessment of physical activity. Its limitations and possibilities in qualitative assessment need to be investigated further.,"Reimer, Lara Marie; Weigel, Severin; Ehrenstorfer, Florian; Adikari, Malintha; Birkle, Wolfgang; Jonas, Stephan",Studies in health technology and informatics,407,5

Since its publication, debate has arisen around whether results could be applied to mature trauma systems in developed nations, with global opinion divided. The aim of this study was to determine if, among trauma patients in or at significant risk of major haemorrhages, there is an association of geographic region with the proportion of patients that received tranexamic acid. Materials and Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature. Potentially eligible papers were first screened via title and abstract screening. A full copy of the remaining papers was then obtained and screened for final inclusion. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for non-randomised control trials was used for quality assessment of the final studies included. A meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model, reporting variation in use sub-grouped by geographical location. Results: There were 727 papers identified through database searching and 23 manuscripts met the criteria for final inclusion in this review. There was a statistically significant variation in the use of TXA for included patients. Europe and Oceania had higher usage rates of TXA compared to other continents. Use of TXA in Asia and Africa was significantly less than other continents and varied use was observed in North America. Conclusions: A large geographical variance in the use of TXA for trauma patients in or at significant risk of major haemorrhage currently exists. The populations in Asia and Africa, where the results of CRASH-2 could be most readily generalised to, reported low rates of use. The reason why remains unclear and further research is required to standardise the use of TXA for trauma resuscitation.","Walsh, Kieran; O'Keeffe, Francis; Mitra, Biswadev",Medicina,407,27

Recently special attention has been paid to the relationship of the WT1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs16754 with AML risk and outcome, but the conflicting results made it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. In the present study, we systematically reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis of existing evidence. We searched Embase, Pubmed, Web of Science, Medline, Cochrane Library, Wanfang, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases using predefined search methodology for relevant studies. We pooled odd ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) to evaluate the association between SNP rs16754 and AML risk. In addition, we analyzed hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI for overall survive, relapse-free survival, and disease-free survival. Q-statistic was used to assess the homogeneity and Egger test was used to evaluate publication bias. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria for analysis. The results of fixed-effect meta-analyses revealed no association between SNP rs16754 and AML risk (AA + GA vs GG: OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.71-1.19, P = .518; AA vs GA + GG: OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 0.86-1.76, P = .262; AA vs GG: OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.68-1.63, P = .820; AG vs AA: OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.53-1.13, P = .186; AG vs GG: OR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.68-1.16, P = .376). In subgroup analysis by race, age, and disease type, we did not find any significant association. However, the presence of rs16754 GA/GG genotype was associated with improved overall survive (HR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.26-0.91, P = .024) and relapse-free survival (HR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.68-1.00, P = .048) compared with the rs16754 AA. In summary, the WT1 SNP rs16754 was not associated with AML risk, but it had a significant impact on clinical outcome in AML patients.","Yu, Xin; Zhang, Yuan; Liu, Shuang; Mu, Yu; Shang, Fengjia; Zhang, Nan",Medicine,407,26

At moderate content of HFP, this fluorocopolymer remains semicrystalline and is able to crystallize. Amphiphilic BCPs, containing a P(VDF-co-HFP) segment could, thus be appealing for the preparation of self-assembled block copolymer morphologies through crystallization-driven self-assembly (CDSA) in selective solvents. Here the synthesis, characterization by 1H and 19F NMR spectroscopies, GPC, TGA, DSC, and XRD; and the self-assembly behavior of a P(VDF-co-HFP)-b-PEG-b-P(VDF-co-HFP) triblock copolymer were studied. The well-defined ABA amphiphilic fluorinated triblock copolymer was self-assembled into nano-objects by varying a series of key parameters such as the solvent and the non -solvent, the self-assembly protocols, and the temperature. A large range of morphologies such as spherical, square, rectangular, fiber-like, and platelet structures with sizes ranging from a few nanometers to micrometers was obtained depending on the self-assembly protocols and solvents systems used. The temperature-induced crystallization-driven self-assembly (TI-CDSA) protocol allowed some control over the shape and size of some of the morphologies.","Folgado, Enrique; Mayor, Matthias; Ladmiral, Vincent; Semsarilar, Mona",Molecules,407,33

METHODS Reductions in age- and sex-specific mortality seen in each BRICS country between 1990 and 2011 were measured. These results were compared with those of the best-performing countries in the world and the best-performing countries with similar income levels. We estimated each country's progress in reducing mortality and compared changes in that country's mortality rates against other countries with similar mean incomes to examine changes in avoidable mortality. FINDINGS The relative health performance of the five study countries differed markedly over the study period. Brazil demonstrated fairly even improvement in relative health performance across the different age and sex subgroups that we assessed. India's improvement was more modest and more varied across the subgroups. South Africa and the Russian Federation exhibited large declines in health performance as well as large sex-specific inequalities in health. Although China's levels of avoidable mortality decreased in absolute terms, the level of improvement appeared low in the context of China's economic growth. CONCLUSION When evaluating a country's health performance in terms of avoidable mortality, it is useful to compare that performance against the performance of other countries. Such comparison allows any country-specific improvements to be distinguished from general global improvements.","Petrie, Dennis; Tang, Kam Ki",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,407,1

We investigated whether this increase is a common feature in the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden). MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was based on the Nordic Arthroplasty Register Association (NARA) dataset. 432,168 primary THAs from 1995 to 2009 were included (Denmark: 83,853, Finland 78,106, Norway 88,455, and Sweden 181,754). Adjusted survival analyses were performed using Cox regression models with revision due to infection as the endpoint. The effect of risk factors such as the year of surgery, age, sex, diagnosis, type of prosthesis, and fixation were assessed. RESULTS 2,778 (0.6%) of the primary THAs were revised due to infection. Compared to the period 1995-1999, the relative risk (with 95% CI) of revision due to infection was 1.1 (1.0-1.2) in 2000-2004 and 1.6 (1.4-1.7) in 2005-2009. Adjusted cumulative 5-year revision rates due to infection were 0.46% (0.42-0.50) in 1995-1999, 0.54% (0.50-0.58) in 2000-2004, and 0.71% (0.66-0.76) in 2005-2009. The entire increase in risk of revision due to infection was within 1 year of primary surgery, and most notably in the first 3 months. The risk of revision due to infection increased in all 4 countries. Risk factors for revision due to infection were male sex, hybrid fixation, cement without antibiotics, and THA performed due to inflammatory disease, hip fracture, or femoral head necrosis. None of these risk factors increased in incidence during the study period. INTERPRETATION We found increased relative risk of revision and increased cumulative 5-year revision rates due to infection after primary THA during the period 1995-2009. No change in risk factors in the NARA dataset could explain this increase. We believe that there has been an actual increase in the incidence of prosthetic joint infections after THA.","Dale, Håvard; Fenstad, Anne M; Hallan, Geir; Havelin, Leif I; Furnes, Ove; Overgaard, Søren; Pedersen, Alma B; Kärrholm, Johan; Garellick, Göran; Pulkkinen, Pekka; Eskelinen, Antti; Mäkelä, Keijo; Engesæter, Lars B",Acta orthopaedica,407,8

DESIGN A longitudinal study of 997 survivors, recruited from among 1,331 individuals hospitalized for SARS, were interviewed at 6, 12, and 18 months after hospitalization. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Psychological and physical functioning at each time point was measured using the 12-item Medical Outcome Study Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). RESULTS Four latent classes were identified--chronic dysfunction, delayed dysfunction, recovery, and resilience. All groups had better physical health than the chronic group. Resilient and recovered individuals had greater social support and less SARS-related worry, and resilient individuals were more likely to be male. The resilient group also had greater social support than the delayed group and better physical functioning than the recovered group. CONCLUSION This study demonstrated that longitudinal outcome trajectories following a major health-threat event in an Asian sample bear close resemblance to prototypical trajectories observed in trauma studies using Western samples. Unique predictors of the trajectories included factors observed in previous studies, such as social support, as well as factors of particular relevance to a major disease outbreak, such as SARS-related worry.","Bonanno, George A; Ho, Samuel M Y; Chan, Jane C K; Kwong, Rosalie S Y; Cheung, Celia K Y; Wong, Claudia P Y; Wong, Vivian C W","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",407,1

The stigma on the treatment of these complex situations is the focus of this review. The time span and context of the review are set to cover the period from 2006 to the present; the review includes related themes of stigma. RECENT FINDINGS The stigma attached to the management of somatic illnesses of patients with mental disorders is considered as a more recent issue of concern. Few relevant studies could be found. Medical comorbidities among people with mental disorders along with the treatment gap constitute a public-health problem. SUMMARY The stigma attached to mental disorders in general forms the basis of the stigma towards the physical health problems of these patient groups. The impact of stigma on somatic treatment and care for people with comorbid mental and somatic disorders is discussed in its context as a public-health problem. Integrative services, and optimism and hope in health professionals are essential factors in reducing such stigma, and hence in enhancing better healthcare.","Küey, Levent",Current opinion in psychiatry,407,1

In experiment 1, birds were fed a basal diet (starter, 102 ppm; grower, 209 ppm) or the basal diet supplemented with 3,600, 4,500, or 5,400 ppm Mn from either TBMC or manganese sulfate (MnSO(4)), and BW, feed intake, and plasma Mn were measured. In experiments 2 and 3, diets included the basal diet (45 and 43 ppm Mn, respectively) and the basal diet supplemented with graded levels of either TBMC or MnSO(4) ranging from 30 to 240 ppm Mn. Body weight and feed intake were measured and tibia, bile, and liver were collected for mineral analysis; heart samples were taken for manganese superoxide dismutase activity, protein, and relative mRNA abundance. In experiment 1, BW differed among treatments, with higher Mn leading to lower BW (P < 0.05). Birds from all treatments showed higher plasma Mn than birds fed the basal diet. Birds supplemented with the highest level of MnSO(4) had the highest level of plasma Mn (P < 0.05). In experiment 2, tibia and liver Mn increased with higher dietary Mn regardless of source (P < 0.05). Liver Mn increased up to the 60 ppm diets whereas Mn in the tibia was highest with the 130 ppm diets. Bile Mn increased with increasing dietary Mn, but these differences were not significant. In experiment 3, manganese superoxide dismutase activity, protein, and relative mRNA abundance were not affected by diet. The calculated bioavailabilities of TBMC and MnSO(4) did not differ significantly (P > 0.20). Together, these results indicate that TBMC is as effective as and better tolerated than MnSO(4) and that supplementing Mn at the lowest level used in this study may be sufficient for normal development of broiler chickens.","Conly, A K; Poureslami, R; Koutsos, E A; Batal, A B; Jung, B; Beckstead, R; Peterson, D G",Poultry science,407,19

Risk factors associated with severe disease and mortality include advanced age, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Each of these risk factors pathologically disrupts the lipidome, including immunomodulatory eicosanoid and docosanoid lipid mediators (LMs). We hypothesized that dysregulation of LMs may be a defining feature of the severity of COVID-19. By examining LMs and polyunsaturated fatty acid precursor lipids in serum from hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we demonstrate that moderate and severe disease are separated by specific differences in abundance of immune-regulatory and proinflammatory LMs. This difference in LM balance corresponded with decreased LM products of ALOX12 and COX2 and an increase LMs products of ALOX5 and cytochrome p450. Given the important immune-regulatory role of LMs, these data provide mechanistic insight into an immuno-lipidomic imbalance in severe COVID-19.","Schwarz, Benjamin; Sharma, Lokesh; Roberts, Lydia; Peng, Xiaohua; Bermejo, Santos; Leighton, Ian; Casanovas-Massana, Arnau; Minasyan, Maksym; Farhadian, Shelli; Ko, Albert I; Dela Cruz, Charles S; Bosio, Catharine M",Journal of immunology,407,6

Participants completed standardized speech and language tests as well as a mispronunciation detection task targeting omissions and substitutions of the phonemes /k, s, ɹ/ in five word positions/shapes. Results The children with SSD obtained significantly lower perceptual accuracy than the children with typical development. There was no statistically significant effect for phoneme. Omissions were more likely to be detected by both groups of participants compared with substitutions, and children with SSD had greater difficulty identifying substitutions as incorrectly produced words. Conclusions Speech perception difficulties may be a distinguishing feature of children with phonological SSD and without concomitant language difficulties.

We and others showed that PA-X has a strong ability to suppress host protein synthesis via host mRNA decay, which is mediated by endonuclease activity in its N-terminal domain (B. W. Jagger, H. M.

Takimoto, 2013, J Virol 87:3108-3118, http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JVI.02826-12). However, the mechanism of host mRNA degradation, especially where and how PA-X targets mRNAs, has not been analyzed. In this study, we determined the localization of PA-X and the role of the C-terminal unique region in shutoff activity. Quantitative subcellular localization analysis revealed that PA-X was located equally in both cytoplasm and nucleus. By characterizing a series of PA-X C-terminal deletion mutants, we found that the first 9 amino acids were sufficient for nuclear localization, but an additional 6 residues were required to induce the maximum shutoff activity observed with intact PA-X. Importantly, forced nuclear localization of the PA-X C-terminal deletion mutant enhanced shutoff activity, highlighting the ability of nuclear PA-X to degrade host mRNAs more efficiently. However, PA-X also inhibited luciferase expression from transfected mRNAs synthesized in vitro, suggesting that PA-X also degrades mRNAs in the cytoplasm. Among the basic amino acids in the PA-X C-terminal region, 3 residues, 195K, 198K, and 199R, were identified as key residues for inducing host shutoff and nuclear localization. Overall, our data indicate a critical role for the 15 residues in the PA-X C-terminal domain in degrading mRNAs in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. IMPORTANCE Influenza A viruses express PA-X proteins to suppress global host gene expression, including host antiviral genes, to allow efficient viral replication in infected cells. However, little is known about how PA-X induces host shutoff. In this study, we showed that PA-X localized equally in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of the cells, but the nuclear localization of PA-X mediated by its C-terminal region has a significant impact on shutoff activity. Three basic residues at the C-terminal region play a critical role in nuclear localization, but additional basic residues were required for maximum shutoff activity. Our findings indicate that PA-X targets and degrades mRNAs in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, and that the first 15 residues of the PA-X unique C-terminal region play a critical role in shutoff activity.","Hayashi, Tsuyoshi; Chaimayo, Chutikarn; McGuinness, James; Takimoto, Toru",Journal of virology,407,1

This systematic review aimed to provide an overview of contemporary animal models of cardiac arrest. METHODS Using a comprehensive research strategy, we searched PubMed and EMBASE from March 8, 2011 to March 8, 2016 for cardiac arrest animal models. Two investigators reviewed titles and abstracts for full text inclusion from which data were extracted according to pre-defined definitions. RESULTS Search criteria yielded 1741 unique titles and abstracts of which 490 full articles were included. The most common animals used were pigs (52%) followed by rats (35%) and mice (6%). Studies favored males (52%) over females (16%); 17% of studies included both sexes, while 14% omitted to report on sex. The most common methods for induction of cardiac arrest were either electrically-induced ventricular fibrillation (54%), asphyxia (25%), or potassium (8%). The median no-flow time was 8min (quartiles: 5, 8, range: 0-37min). The majority of studies used adrenaline during resuscitation (64%), while bicarbonate (17%), vasopressin (8%) and other drugs were used less prevalently. In 53% of the studies, the post-cardiac arrest observation time was ≥24h. Neurological function was an outcome in 48% of studies while 43% included assessment of a cardiac outcome. CONCLUSIONS Multiple animal models of cardiac arrest exist. The great heterogeneity of these models along with great variability in definitions and reporting make comparisons between studies difficult. There is a need for standardization of animal cardiac arrest research and reporting.","Vognsen, Mikael; Fabian-Jessing, Bjørn K; Secher, Niels; Løfgren, Bo; Dezfulian, Cameron; Andersen, Lars W; Granfeldt, Asger",Resuscitation,407,1

Cross-sectional MRI is indicative of pheochromocytoma versus adrenocortical carcinoma or metastasis, though there are no typical PCC symptoms and plasma and urine metanephrines are within normal ranges. Since malignancy cannot be excluded, right adrenalectomy is performed.

POP procedures (median rate, 1.38/1000 women; range, 0.51-2.55 prolapse procedures/1000 women) were performed 1.8 times more frequently than continence procedures (median rate, 0.75/1000 women; range, 0.46-1.65 continence procedures/1000 women). Repairs of the anterior vaginal compartment represented 54% of POP procedures; posterior repairs represented 43% of the procedures, and apical compartment repairs represented 20% of POP procedures. Median rate of graft usage was 15.7% of anterior vaginal repairs (range, 3.3-25.6%) and 8.5% (range, 3.2-17%) of posterior vaginal repairs. Apical compartment repairs were repaired vaginally at a median rate of 70% (range, 35-95%). Sacral colpopexy represented a median rate of 17% (range, 5-65%) of apical repairs; 61% of sacral colpopexies were performed minimally invasively. Between 2010 and 2012, there was a 3.7% median reduction in transvaginal grafts, a 4.0% reduction in midurethral slings, and a 25% increase in sacral colpopexies that were performed per 1000 women. Midurethral slings represented 82% of female continence surgeries. CONCLUSION The 5-fold variation in the rate of prolapse interventions within OECD countries needs further evaluation. The significant heterogeneity (>10 times) in the rates at which individual POP procedures are performed indicates a lack of uniformity in the delivery of care to women with POP and demands the development of uniform guidelines for the surgical management of prolapse. In contrast, the midurethral slings were the standard female continence surgery performed throughout OECD countries in 2012.","Haya, Nir; Baessler, Kaven; Christmann-Schmid, Corina; de Tayrac, Renaud; Dietz, Viviane; Guldberg, Rikke; Mascarenhas, Teresa; Nussler, Emil; Ballard, Emma; Ankardal, Maud; Boudemaghe, Thierry; Wu, Jennifer M; Maher, Christopher F",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,407,1

The ECG-based synchronization is well established for MR scanners with magnetic fields up to 3 T. However, this technique is prone to errors in ultra high field environments, e.g. in 7 T MR scanners as used in research applications. The high magnetic fields cause severe magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects which disturb the ECG signal. Image synchronization is thus less reliable and yields artefacts in CMR images. METHODS A strategy based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was pursued in this work to enhance the ECG contribution and attenuate the MHD effect. ICA was applied to 12-lead ECG signals recorded inside a 7 T MR scanner. An automatic source identification procedure was proposed to identify an independent component (IC) dominated by the ECG signal. The identified IC was then used for detecting the R-peaks. The presented ICA-based method was compared to other R-peak detection methods using 1) the raw ECG signal, 2) the raw vectorcardiogram (VCG), 3) the state-of-the-art gating technique based on the VCG, 4) an updated version of the VCG-based approach and 5) the ICA of the VCG. RESULTS ECG signals from eight volunteers were recorded inside the MR scanner. Recordings with an overall length of 87 min accounting for 5457 QRS complexes were available for the analysis. The records were divided into a training and a test dataset. In terms of R-peak detection within the test dataset, the proposed ICA-based algorithm achieved a detection performance with an average sensitivity (Se) of 99.2%, a positive predictive value (+P) of 99.1%, with an average trigger delay and jitter of 5.8 ms and 5.0 ms, respectively. Long term stability of the demixing matrix was shown based on two measurements of the same subject, each being separated by one year, whereas an averaged detection performance of Se = 99.4% and +P = 99.7% was achieved.Compared to the state-of-the-art VCG-based gating technique at 7 T, the proposed method increased the sensitivity and positive predictive value within the test dataset by 27.1% and 42.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The presented ICA-based method allows the estimation and identification of an IC dominated by the ECG signal. R-peak detection based on this IC outperforms the state-of-the-art VCG-based technique in a 7 T MR scanner environment.","Krug, Johannes W; Rose, Georg; Clifford, Gari D; Oster, Julien",Journal of cardiovascular magnetic resonance : official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance,407,24

METHODS Single-center, prospective observational cohort study. We recorded the presence of pain at operating room discharge, at 6 and 24 hours, using the numeric rating scale (NRS). We recorded also age, sex, ethnic origin, American Society of Anaesthesia physical status (ASA PS) classification, Charlson Comorbidity Index, the aetiology of the vitreoretinal pathology, length of surgery, and type of surgical procedure performed. RESULTS Eye pain (NRS > 3) was present in 3 patients (0.7%) at operating room discharge, 59 (13.2%) at 6 and 65 (14.6%) at 24 hours after surgery. LASSO logistic regression analysis identified age, ASA PS, race, along with tamponade as independent risk factors for eye pain at 6 hours. Scleral buckling was selected for eye pain at 24 hrs. CONCLUSIONS A protocol for pain control after PPV should be considered, especially in younger, non-Caucasian people, and patients with high ASA PS grade. Moreover, attention must be paid when additional surgical procedures are requested, restricting them to selected patients, and using the appropriate agent for intraocular tamponade.","Bandera, Elisabetta; Piva, Simone; Gambaretti, Eros; Minelli, Cosetta; Rizzo, Francesco; Rizzolo, Andrea; Morescalchi, Francesco; Ambrosoli, Luigi; Semeraro, Francesco; Latronico, Nicola",Minerva anestesiologica,407,13

Such efforts are challenged by metabolite transport limitations, which arise when complex plant pathways distributed across organelles and tissues are reconstructed in unicellular hosts without concomitant transport machinery. We recently reported an engineered yeast platform for production of the tropane alkaloid (TA) drugs hyoscyamine and scopolamine, in which product accumulation is limited by vacuolar transport. Here, we demonstrate that alleviation of transport limitations at multiple steps in an engineered pathway enables increased production of TAs and screening of useful derivatives. We first show that supervised classifier models trained on a tissue-delineated transcriptome from the TA-producing plant Atropa belladonna can predict TA transporters with greater efficacy than conventional regression- and clustering-based approaches. We demonstrate that two of the identified transporters, AbPUP1 and AbLP1, increase TA production in engineered yeast by facilitating vacuolar export and cellular reuptake of littorine and hyoscyamine. We incorporate four different plant transporters, cofactor regeneration mechanisms, and optimized growth conditions into our yeast platform to achieve improvements in de novo hyoscyamine and scopolamine production of over 100-fold (480 μg/L) and 7-fold (172 μg/L). Finally, we leverage computational tools for biosynthetic pathway prediction to produce two different classes of TA derivatives, nortropane alkaloids and tropane N-oxides, from simple precursors. Our work highlights the importance of cellular transport optimization in recapitulating complex PNP biosyntheses in microbial hosts and illustrates the utility of computational methods for gene discovery and expansion of heterologous biosynthetic diversity.","Srinivasan, Prashanth; Smolke, Christina D",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,407,1

STUDY DESIGN Experimental ex vivo study. ANIMALS Cervical spinal segments (C5-C7) from eight canine cadavers. METHODS The range of motion (ROM) and elastic zone stiffness (EZS) of the spines were determined with a four-point bending device in flexion/extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation for four conditions: native, discectomy, cage (at C6-C7), and cage with plates (at C6-C7). The disc height index (DHI) for each condition was determined using radiography. RESULTS Discectomy resulted in overall increased ROM (p < .01) and EZS (p < .05) and decreased DHI (p < .005) when compared to the native condition. Placement of the cage increased DHI (p < .001) and restored total ROM during flexion/extension, lateral bending and axial rotation, and EZS during flexion/extension to the level of the native spine. Application of the plates further reduced the total ROM during flexion/extension (p < .001) and lateral bending (p < .001), but restored ROM in extension and EZS during lateral bending. No implant failure, subsidence, or significant cage migration occurred during loading. CONCLUSION An anchorless intervertebral cage used as a stand-alone device was able to restore the disc height and spinal stability to the level of the native cervical spine, whereas the addition of plates further reduced the spinal unit mobility. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE This study implies that the intervertebral cage may be used as a stand-alone device in the spinal unit fixation in the canine cervical spine.","Beishuizen, Rick; Reints Bok, Tjarda E; Teunissen, Michelle; van der Veen, Albert J; Emanuel, Kaj S; Tryfonidou, Marianna A; Meij, Bjorn P",Veterinary surgery : VS,407,5

BACKGROUND Presenteeism (going to work ill) is a phenomenon studied from different perspectives, and it has become especially important during the current COVID-19 outbreak; its connection to high healthcare costs, patient safety breaches and negative nurse well-being has been proved. INTRODUCTION The nursing profession is particularly associated with caring for the culture of teamwork, loyalty to colleagues and professional identity. This condition enhances the 'super nurse phenomenon', even though nurses do not feel physically and psychologically able to work. METHODS A multicentre, cross-sectional study was conducted in three different country contexts: Oviedo (Spain), Porto (Portugal) and São Paulo (Brazil). Nurses performing functions in hospitals and primary health care were enrolled. Informed consent and data collection questionnaires were hand delivered. The Stanford Presenteeism Scale-6 was applied. RESULTS A total of 659 nurses participated. Portuguese nurses showed greater prevalence of presenteeism, followed by Brazilian and Spanish nurses. Younger nurses with less professional experience presented lower levels of presenteeism but greater psychological commitment. Male participants showed lower capacity to complete work when ill than female participants. CONCLUSIONS Age and length of professional experience proved to be significant predictors of total presenteeism, although only professional experience revealed statistical significance in the adjusted model. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY The knowledge of this phenomenon among nurses highlights the need for the development of strategies in the curriculum of nursing students and organizations. Resilience and ergonomic training should be applied in the training programmes of the students and reinforced by the health centre managers. It is essential that healthcare systems design worksite wellness programmes that pursue greater physical and mental well-being for healthcare professionals.","Mosteiro-Díaz, Maria-Pilar; Baldonedo-Mosteiro, María; Borges, Elisabete; Baptista, Patricia; Queirós, Cristina; Sánchez-Zaballos, Marta; Felli, Vanda; Abreu, Margarida; Silva, Fábio; Franco-Correia, Sara",International nursing review,407,33

Structure of starches were analyzed with size exclusion chromatography and fluorophore-assisted capillary electrophoresis. Results showed that the amylose content of Tartary buckwheat starch (TBS) and common buckwheat starch (CBS) was 3-4% lower than that of wheat starch. However, no significant difference in the digestibility was found between them. The fast digestion rate coefficient of TBS was negatively correlated with the amount of long amylopectin chains (24 < DP ≤ 36), and the total digested starch percentage of CBS was negatively correlated with the amount of medium-long amylopectin chains (13 < DP ≤ 24). This suggests that the digestibility of fully gelatinized starch had no association with the botanical sources but may be more influenced by starch structure.","Du, Jin; Pan, Ruirong; Obadi, Mohammed; Li, Haiteng; Shao, Feng; Sun, Jun; Wang, Yifan; Qi, Yajing; Xu, Bin",Food chemistry,407,1

Tumor Associated Tissue Eosinophilia (TATE) has long been evaluated in the diagnosis and progression of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs). However, their association with Tumor Associated Blood Eosinophilia (TABE) in OSCCs is still far fetched. We, therefore, attempted to evaluate their individual roles and to achieve a ratio between TATE and TABE in order to signify its usage in objectifying the diagnosis. Materials and Methods TATE was evaluated using H and E stain per 10 high power fields in 33 previously diagnosed cases of OSCC which were retrieved from department archives. TABE values were achieved from complete blood hemogram reports of patients. TATE/TABE ratio was calculated. All the parameters were clinicopathologically correlated and statistically evaluated using SPSS. Results TATE represented higher values in well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (WDSCC) and poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (PDSCC) and was least in moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (MDSCC), whereas TABE linearly increased from WDSCC to PDSCC. TNM Stage II cases revealed the highest TATE and lowest TABE. TATE/TABE ratio was the highest in WDSCC. Conclusion Due to the dual nature of eosinophils in early and late carcinogenesis events, evaluation of only TATE might not be conclusive in determining tumor grade. Hence, in a first of its kind attempt, the TATE/TABE ratio may be suitable to achieve a criterion for the determination of tumor grade and may also help to unfold the underlying biologic events.","Verma, Flora; Juneja, Saurabh; Tandon, Ankita; Shetty, Devi Charan",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,407,1

The spleen poses specific problems for techniques, such as SILS, due to its volume and texture, and little clinical information is available on the topic. We describe our initial experience using SILS for the management of splenic diseases. METHODS Between December 2008 and September 2009, we attempted SILS in eight patients: four men and four women with a median age of 44 (range, 26-73) years, and body mass index of 24.5 (range, 18-31). Preoperative diagnosis was malignancy (n = 3), ITP (n = 1), HIV-related hypersplenism (n = 1), spherocytosis (n = 1), and splenic cyst (n = 2). SILS was attempted transumbilically in four cases and through a 15-mm subcostal single incision in the other four. As entry port we used either three trocars (one of 12 mm and two of 5 mm) inserted through the single-site incision or the umbilicus, or a multiport (Triport, Olympus) device. Instrumentation used consisted of curved instruments, a flexible-tip 10-mm scope, and the harmonic scalpel. Visualization of the spleen and standard dissection of attachments was accomplished, and splenectomy was completed by stapling of the splenic hilum. The spleen was extracted through the single-site incision. In two cases, unroofing of a splenic cyst was performed transumbilically. RESULTS The SILS procedure was successful in six of the eight patients (75%). Conversion to conventional laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) was required in two patients due to adhesions and spleen size. Median operative time was 97 (range, 60-150) min. There were no postoperative complications, and median stay was 4 (range, 2-5) days. Median spleen weight was 485 (range, 340-590) g. CONCLUSIONS SILS access can be safely used for operative visualization, hilum transection, and spleen removal, further reducing parietal wall trauma. The definitive clinical, esthetic, and functional advantages require further analysis.","Targarona, Eduardo M; Pallares, Jose Luis; Balague, Carmen; Luppi, Carlos Rodríguez; Marinello, Franco; Hernández, Pilar; Martínez, Carmen; Trias, Manuel",Surgical endoscopy,407,16

Even though bioactive meshes loaded with antibiotics or antiseptics are slowly emerging in the market, the available solutions still lack versatility. Here, we proposed a polymer solution, i.e., hyaluronic acid-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (HApN), which forms a hydrogel to be used as coating for meshes only when it reaches body temperature. METHODS We assessed how the gelation of HApN was influenced by the incorporation of different antibiotic and antiseptic formulations, and how this gel can be used to coat several mesh types. The impact of the coating on the elastic behavior of a macroporous mesh was tested under cyclic elongation condition. Finally, we selected two different coating formulations, one based on antibiotics (gentamicin + rifampicin) and one based on antiseptic (chlorhexidine) and tested in vitro their antimicrobial efficacies. RESULTS HApN can be used as carrier for different antimicrobial agents, without having a strong influence on its gelation behavior. Porous or dense meshes can be coated with this polymer, even though the stability was not optimal on macroporous meshes such as Optilene when pores are too large. HApN loaded with drugs inhibited in vitro the growth of several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. CONCLUSION Compared to the available technologies developed to endow meshes with antibacterial activity, the proposed HApN offers further versatility with potential to prevent mesh-related infection in hernioplasty.","Pérez-Köhler, B; Linardi, F; Pascual, G; Bellón, J M; Eglin, D; Guillaume, O",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,407,11

In a large proportion of critically ill patients, conventional sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns are replaced by atypical sleep. On the other hand, some non-sedated patients can display usual sleep EEG patterns. In the latter, sleep is highly fragmented and disrupted and conventional rules may not be optimal. We sought to determine whether sleep continuity could be a useful metric to quantify the amount of sleep with recuperative function in critically ill patients with usual sleep EEG features. METHODS We retrospectively reanalyzed polysomnographies recorded in non-sedated critically ill patients requiring non-invasive ventilation (NIV) for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. Using conventional rules, we built two-state hypnograms (sleep and wake) and identified all sleep episodes. The percentage of time spent in sleep bouts (<10 minutes), short naps (>10 and <30 minutes) and long naps (>30 minutes) was used to describe sleep continuity. In a first study, we compared these measures regarding good (NIV success) or poor outcome (NIV failure). In a second study performed on a different patient group, we compared these measurements during NIV and during spontaneous breathing. RESULTS While fragmentation indices were similar in the two groups, the percentage of total sleep time spent in short naps was higher and the percentage of sleep time spent in sleep bouts was lower in patients with successful NIV. The percentage of total sleep time spent in long naps was higher and the percentage of sleep time spent in sleep bouts was lower during NIV than during spontaneous breathing; the level of reproducibility of sleep continuity measures between scorers was high. CONCLUSIONS Sleep continuity measurements could constitute a clinically relevant and reproducible assessment of sleep disruption in non-sedated ICU patients with usual sleep EEG.","Drouot, Xavier; Bridoux, Agathe; Thille, Arnaud W; Roche-Campo, Ferran; Cordoba-Izquierdo, Ana; Katsahian, Sandrine; Brochard, Laurent; d'Ortho, Marie-Pia",Critical care,407,31

Identifying the determinants of quality is a complex task as there are a myriad of variables to choose from. Researchers in this field have assessed a range of organisational and environmental factors (for example: staff composition, facility ownership, facility size) for an association with various quality metrics. Less attention has been paid to the determinants of compliance with quality regulation. Identifying the determinants of compliance has the potential to improve regulatory processes and can inform quality improvement initiatives undertaken by service providers and policy makers. This protocol describes a systematic review which will review literature from a wide range of study designs and sources to develop an overview of the determinants of regulatory compliance in health and social care services. Methods: A wide range of study designs and grey literature will be sought for this review. Searches will be conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, SocINDEX and CINAHL databases. The studies included in the review will be subject to quality appraisal with reference to the collection of tools available from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Data extraction will be informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). A narrative synthesis will be conducted on the barriers, facilitators and factors associated with compliance, with reference to the concepts mapped onto the CFIR. GRADE-CERQual will be used to grade the overall body of evidence. Conclusion: The findings of this review will be useful to regulators to inform regulatory policy and practice.

We systematically reviewed literature for reports on the neurological outcome of infants born with isolated CDH. The primary outcome was neurodevelopmental delay. Secondary outcomes included, motor skills, intelligence, vision, hearing, language and behavior abnormalities. Thirteen out of 87 (15%) studies reported on isolated CDH, including 2624 out of 24,146 children. Neurodevelopmental delay was investigated in four studies and found to be present in 16% (3-34%) of children. This was mainly attributed to motor problems in 13% (2-30%), whereas cognitive dysfunction only in 5% (0-20%) and hearing in 3% (1-7%). One study assessed the effect of fetal surgery. When both isolated and non-isolated children were included, these numbers were higher. This systematic review demonstrates that only a minority of studies focused on isolated CDH, with neurodevelopmental delay present in 16% of children born with CDH.

We measured and analysed the correlation of the stimulated saliva volume, serum amylase, and cytokines in resting saliva at baseline and 1 month after chemoradiotherapy with oral mucositis levels. RESULTS We observed a negative correlation between the serum amylase level at the beginning of chemoradiotherapy and the stimulated saliva volume at 1 month after chemoradiotherapy (p=0.03). Epidermal growth factor in resting saliva was significantly reduced after chemoradiotherapy (p<0.01). The incidence of severe oral mucositis during chemoradiotherapy was significantly higher and negatively associated with the epidermal growth factor and keratinocyte growth factor levels (p=0.04, p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS The serum amylase level at the beginning of chemoradiotherapy may be a predictor of the recovery of the saliva volume. Furthermore, cytokines such as epidermal growth factor and keratinocyte growth factor in resting saliva affect the development of oral mucositis during chemoradiotherapy.","Kawahara, Kenta; Hiraki, Akimitsu; Arita, Hidetaka; Takeshita, Hisashi; Hirosue, Akiyuki; Matsuoka, Yuichiro; Sakata, Junki; Obayashi, Yuko; Nakashima, Hikaru; Hirayama, Mayumi; Nagata, Masashi; Yoshida, Ryoji; Shinohara, Masanori; Nakayama, Hideki",Oral diseases,407,1

Health care systems globally are amid an unprecedented challenge. Since its emergence in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the virus has spread to 185 countries worldwide, with more than 2.63 million cases confirmed and more than 183 thousand related deaths (as of 23/04/2020). According to current evidence, the novel coronavirus is transmitted from human-to-human mainly via respiratory droplets of different sizes, contact with bodily fluids, or from contaminated surfaces. In the context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures that generate aerosols are performed. The common clinical symptoms of the highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic virus include fever, cough, fatigue, ageusia and anosmia and in some patients, gastrointestinal infection symptoms. The elderly and patients with comorbidities are susceptible to infection and prone to severe complications, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokines storm. Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation. Under these circumstances, it is critical for health care settings, including nuclear medicine departments to take infection control measures, to prevent a potential spread not just among patients but also to staff members as well as to reconsider the performance of randomized clinical trials. There have already been papers on the radiology preparedness that should be applied to radiology and nuclear medicine departments to support the care of patients with COVID-19 and maintain radiologic diagnostic and interventional support for the entirety of the hospital and healthcare system, particularly for emergencies, without jeopardizing an outbreak in the units. Since most nuclear medicine diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are non-urgent, the general guidance from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for infection prevention and control is to postpone scheduled procedure after cautious risk assessment, with certain exceptions. Individualized approach of each case is a sine qua non of ensuring low transmission of COVID-19 as well as effective and safe management of patients admitted to nuclear medicine departments. Another major issue raised is the possible impact COVID-19 on the transport of medical radioisotopes. By the 1st of April 2020, the Euratom Supply Agency (ESA) co-chaired the European Observatory on Supply of Medical Radioisotope expressing their concerns related to the impact of COVID-19 on the supply chain and inconsequence on the availability of the most vital medical radioisotopes used in nuclear medicine. Due to the current lockdown situation, extended border controls, reductions and elimination of many commercial passenger flights, competition and cost of cargo and charter options, required appropriate additional support.

This study was performed to evaluate viruses associated with croup in children, with an emphasis on HCoV-NL63. METHODS Nasopharyngeal aspirates were prospectively collected from 182 children hospitalized with croup at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital from January 2005 to June 2009. Multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was conducted for detection of 11 respiratory viruses, and medical records were reviewed. RESULTS Viruses were identified in 147 (80.8%) of the 182 croup patients. The 3 most commonly detected viruses were parainfluenza virus type 1 (PIV1) in 44 (24.2%) patients, HCoV-NL63 in 30 (16.5%) patients, and influenza A virus in 25 (13.7%) patients. Other detected viruses were rhinovirus in 22 (12.1%) patients, PIV type 3 and respiratory syncytial virus in 15 (8.2%) patients, human bocavirus in 8 (4.4%) patients, and several others in a few patients. Coinfections with > or = 2 viruses were found in 20 (11%) patients. HCoV-NL63 was identified primarily in winter, which coincides with the peak occurrence of croup. Patients with HCoV-NL63 infection were younger than those who were positive for PIV1 (median age 13 months versus 21 months, P = 0.006) and had shorter fever duration than influenza A virus infection (median 1.5 days versus 4 days, P = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS PIV1 and HCoV-NL63 were most commonly associated with patients who were hospitalized with croup. HCoV-NL63 is prevalent in winter and is associated with younger age and with shorter fever duration.","Sung, Ji Yeon; Lee, Hoan Jong; Eun, Byung Wook; Kim, So Hee; Lee, So Yeon; Lee, Ju Young; Park, Kyoung Un; Choi, Eun Hwa",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,407,33

Psychometric and research considerations when adopting new testing modes in the time of COVID-19.,15.876765,4.6376395,2020-10-19,"Live streaming platforms such as Twitch that facilitate participatory online communities have become an integral part of game culture. Users of these platforms are predominantly teenagers and young adults, who increasingly spend time socializing online rather than offline. This shift to online behavior can be a double-edged sword when coping with difficult periods in life such as relationship issues, the death of a loved one, or job loss. On the one hand, platforms such as Twitch offer pleasure, distraction, and relatedness with others to help with coping, and the increased sense of anonymity and control could stimulate self-disclosure. However, the prevalence of trolling and memes may also discourage people from opening up, and relationships that are built online-especially those with microcelebrity streamers-could be perceived as more meaningful than they actually are. To create a deeper understanding of Twitch as a new media platform embedded in game culture, and how users perceive its potential as a coping mechanism, we have conducted a first exploration by means of a survey. The questions focused on general Twitch behavior, the difficult period in life, and the role of Twitch during this period. It was distributed online among people who considered themselves active Twitch users, and who had gone through a difficult period. Eighty-four participants completed the entire survey. The majority of participants indicated that Twitch helped them cope, and that it became a larger part of their lives during the difficult period compared to regular viewing. Recurring themes were the entertainment, distraction, and sense of community Twitch offers. Viewing behavior during difficult periods appears to remain largely the same in terms of the streamers that are watched, although time spent viewing increases, and there is a change toward more time spent actively watching rather than having the stream on in the background. With this work, we aim to create a deeper understanding of Twitch as a platform, and its importance for gamers that are going through difficult periods in life.","de Wit, Jan; van der Kraan, Alicia; Theeuwes, Joep",Frontiers in psychology,407,26

While doing so, some variants with evolutionary advantages such as better human to human transmissibility potential might get naturally selected. This short communication demonstrates how the mutation frequency patterns are evolving in 2,457 SAR-CoV-2 strains isolated from COVID-19 patients across diverse Indian states. We have identified 19 such variants showing contrasting mutational probabilities in the span of seven months. Out of these, 14 variants are showing increasing mutational probabilities suggesting their propagation with time due to their unexplored evolutionary advantages. Whereas mutational probabilities of five variants have significantly decreased in June onwards as compared to March/April, suggesting their termination with time. Further in-depth investigation of these identified variants will provide valuable knowledge about the evolution, infection strategies, transmission rates, and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective chart review at a tertiary referral center. METHODS Patients who underwent surgery via EETA from January 2009 to May 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Intraoperative CSF leakage was graded 0-3 in terms of the dural defect size; various repairs were used depending on the grade. RESULTS A total of 777 patients underwent 869 operations via EETA; 609 (70.1%) experienced no intraoperative CSF leakage (grade 0) but 260 (29.9%) did. Leakage was of grade 1 in 135 cases (15.5%), grade 2 in 83 (9.6%), and grade 3 in 42 (4.8%). In 260 patients with intraoperative CSF leakage, a buttress was wedged into the sellar defect site in 178 cases (68.5%) and a pedicled flap was placed in 105 cases (40.4%). Autologous fat (108 cases, 41.5%) and a synthetic dural substitute (91 cases, 35%) were used to fill the dead space of the sellar resection cavity. Postoperative CSF leakage developed in 21 patients: 6 of grade 1, 7 of grade 2, and 8 of grade 3. Buttress placement significantly decreased postoperative leakage in grade 1 patients (p = 0.041). In patients of perioperative leakage grades 2 and 3, postoperative CSF leakage was significantly reduced only when both fat and a buttress were applied (p = 0.042 and p = 0.043, respectively). CONCLUSION A buttress prevented postoperative CSF leakage in grade 1 patients; both fat and buttress were required by patients with intraoperative leakage of grades 2 and 3.","Lee, Il Hwan; Kim, Do Hyun; Park, Jae-Sung; Jeun, Sin-Soo; Hong, Yong-Kil; Kim, Sung Won",PloS one,407,1

METHODS We analyzed revascularization of carotid artery stenosis for patients admitted emergently using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2008-2011). Admission characteristics, economic measures, in-hospital mortality, and iatrogenic stroke were compared between (1) endarterectomy and stenting, (2) patients with and without cerebral infarction, and (3) ultra-early (within 48 hours of admission) and deferred (up to 2 weeks) intervention. RESULTS 72,797 admissions meeting our inclusion criteria were identified. Factors associated with ultra-early revascularization were male patients, low comorbidity burden, stenosis without infarction, and stenting. Ultra-early intervention significantly decreased cost and length of stay, and stenting for patients without infarction decreased length of stay but increased cost. Patients without infarction treated within 48 hours had significantly lower mortality and iatrogenic stroke rate. Patients with infarction receiving ultra-early revascularization had increased odds of mortality and iatrogenic stroke in comparison with the deferred group. Patients with infarction receiving stenting experienced increased odds of mortality in comparison with those receiving endarterectomy, but there was no significant difference in iatrogenic stroke rate. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) administration on the day of revascularization greatly increased the odds of iatrogenic stroke and mortality.

To develop EEG signatures that track loss and recovery of consciousness under GA, we recorded high-density EEGs in humans during gradual induction of and emergence from unconsciousness with propofol. The subjects executed an auditory task at 4-s intervals consisting of interleaved verbal and click stimuli to identify loss and recovery of consciousness. During induction, subjects lost responsiveness to the less salient clicks before losing responsiveness to the more salient verbal stimuli; during emergence they recovered responsiveness to the verbal stimuli before recovering responsiveness to the clicks. The median frequency and bandwidth of the frontal EEG power tracked the probability of response to the verbal stimuli during the transitions in consciousness. Loss of consciousness was marked simultaneously by an increase in low-frequency EEG power (<1 Hz), the loss of spatially coherent occipital alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz), and the appearance of spatially coherent frontal alpha oscillations. These dynamics reversed with recovery of consciousness. The low-frequency phase modulated alpha amplitude in two distinct patterns. During profound unconsciousness, alpha amplitudes were maximal at low-frequency peaks, whereas during the transition into and out of unconsciousness, alpha amplitudes were maximal at low-frequency nadirs. This latter phase-amplitude relationship predicted recovery of consciousness. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of propofol-induced unconsciousness, establish EEG signatures of this brain state that track transitions in consciousness precisely, and suggest strategies for monitoring the brain activity of patients receiving GA.","Purdon, Patrick L; Pierce, Eric T; Mukamel, Eran A; Prerau, Michael J; Walsh, John L; Wong, Kin Foon K; Salazar-Gomez, Andres F; Harrell, Priscilla G; Sampson, Aaron L; Cimenser, Aylin; Ching, ShiNung; Kopell, Nancy J; Tavares-Stoeckel, Casie; Habeeb, Kathleen; Merhar, Rebecca; Brown, Emery N",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,407,7

There are no systematic reviews addressing this question. METHODS A systematic review protocol has been designed and will be reported in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P). We will search for randomized controlled trials evaluating a salt-restricted versus unrestricted regime in patients with cirrhosis and ascites in EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We will also try to identify literature by reviewing reference list of included studies and relevant reviews, screening main conference proceedings, and searching for unpublished and ongoing trials in the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Two researchers will independently undertake selection of studies, data extraction, and assessment of the quality of included studies. We will estimate pooled risk ratios for dichotomous data and the mean difference or standardized mean difference for continuous outcomes. A random effect model will be used for meta-analyses.

Step 2 CS had far reaching effects on medical school curricula and school-based clinical skills assessments. Absent the need to prepare students for this high-stakes exam, will the rigor of foundational clinical skills instruction and assessment remain a priority at medical schools? In this article, the authors consider the potential losses and gains from the elimination of Step 2 CS and explore opportunities to expand local summative assessments beyond the narrow bounds of Step 2 CS. The responsibility for implementing a rigorous and credible summative assessment of clinical skills that are critical for patient safety as medical students transition to residency now lies squarely with medical schools. Robust human simulation (standardized patient) programs, including regional and virtual simulation consortia, can provide infrastructure and expertise for innovative and creative local assessments to meet this need. Novel applications of human simulation and traditional formative assessment methods, such as workplace-based assessments and virtual patients, can contribute to defensible summative decisions about medical students' clinical skills. The need to establish validity evidence for decisions based on these novel assessment methods comprises a timely and relevant focus for medical education research.","Yudkowsky, Rachel; Szauter, Karen",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,407,16

METHODS We conducted an online cross-sectional study using piloted structured questionnaires with self-reported responses from Indian orthopaedic surgeons. Study participants were identified through social networking sites: Facebook and WhatsApp. The extent of anxiety and sleep quality was assessed by the standardised seven-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, single-item sleep quality scale, questions on unavailability of personal protective equipment, training module on COVID-19 and change in orthopaedic patient management. RESULTS One hundred male orthopaedic surgeons responded to the survey with majority (79%) in 30-44 years age group. Severe anxiety scores were observed in 8%; moderate, mild and minimal anxiety was observed in 12%, 27% and 53% surgeons respectively. Changes in management practice due to the pandemic was admitted by 65% respondents. We also observed an association between higher anxiety among surgeons and primary or secondary level of healthcare facility: (p = 0.04). Sleep disturbance was significantly associated with change in management practice to non-operative procedures (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION Anxiety among orthopaedic surgeons during the COVID-19 pandemic is related to factors like younger age group, working in a primary or secondary healthcare facility. Early recognition of anxiety is essential to prevent serious psychological sequelae.","Sharma, Vyom; Kumar, Narinder; Gupta, Bhawna; Mahajan, Akanksha",Journal of orthopaedic surgery,407,1

MATERIAL & METHODS Twenty adult patients with slight-moderate chronic periodontitis received periodontal probing using controlled-force electronic probe at 2 visits. In visit 1, a random arch was probed with either a ball-end (0.6mm diameter, 408 kPa; Test) or straight (0.45mm diameter, 726 kPa; Control) probe tip. The opposing arch was then probed using the other probe tip. Discomfort associated with each probing episode was recorded using visual analogue scale (VAS). 7 days later, tip assignments were alternated from visit 1 and VAS re-scored. VAS scores were compared by probe tip, arches and visits. RESULTS Both tips provided similar VAS scores (median 13.5 for ball-end and 14 for straight, p=0.3713). However, the straight tip was associated with decreased VAS scores in the maxilla (p=0.01). Overall, VAS values did not differ by arch or study visit. Individual VAS scores showed high levels of correlation between study visits and between tips used (R2 =0.86 and 0.64, respectively, P<0.0001).

Focusing on the T cell response, we conducted a longitudinal study of infection-naïve and COVID-19 convalescent donors before vaccination and after their first and second vaccine doses, using a high-parameter CyTOF analysis to phenotype their SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Vaccine-elicited spike-specific T cells responded similarly to stimulation by spike epitopes from the ancestral, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variant strains, both in terms of cell numbers and phenotypes. In infection-naïve individuals, the second dose boosted the quantity and altered the phenotypic properties of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, while in convalescents the second dose changed neither. Spike-specific T cells from convalescent vaccinees differed strikingly from those of infection-naïve vaccinees, with phenotypic features suggesting superior long-term persistence and ability to home to the respiratory tract including the nasopharynx. These results provide reassurance that vaccine-elicited T cells respond robustly to emerging viral variants, confirm that convalescents may not need a second vaccine dose, and suggest that vaccinated convalescents may have more persistent nasopharynx-homing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells compared to their infection-naïve counterparts.","Neidleman, Jason; Luo, Xiaoyu; McGregor, Matthew; Xie, Guorui; Murray, Victoria; Greene, Warner C; Lee, Sulggi A; Roan, Nadia R",eLife,407,1

In this proof-of-concept study, we investigated a small but homogeneous cohort of large, cavernous carotid aneurysms (CCAs) to establish the clinical feasibility of CFD analysis in treatment planning, based on the association between pathophysiology and hemodynamics. METHODS This study included 15 patients with individual large CCAs. We identified calcifications, which indicated atherosclerotic changes, using the masking data of digital subtraction angiography. We conducted a CFD simulation under patient-specific inlet flow rates measured using magnetic resonance (MR) velocimetry. In the post-CFD analysis, we calculated the blood residence time ([Formula: see text]) and segmented the surface exposed to blood residence time over 1 s ([Formula: see text]). We measured the decrease in volume after flow diversion using the original time-of-flight MR angiography data. RESULTS Calcifications were observed in the region with [Formula: see text]. In addition, the ratio of [Formula: see text] to the surface of the aneurysmal domain exhibited a negative relationship with the rate of volume reduction at the 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Post-CFD visualization demonstrated that intra-aneurysmal swirling flow prolonged blood residence time under the condition of a small inlet flow rate, when compared to the aneurysmal volume. CONCLUSION The results of this study suggest the usefulness of CFD analysis for the diagnosis of atherosclerotic changes in large CCAs that may affect the therapeutic response after flow diversion.","Nakajima, Shintaro; Sugiyama, Shinichiro; Oishi, Hidenori; Sato, Kenichi; Matsumoto, Yasushi; Niizuma, Kuniyasu; Fujimura, Miki; Tominaga, Teiji",Neuroradiology,407,1

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has encouraged the development of assessments that can be performed quickly and remotely. The aim of this study was to derive and internally validate decision trees for categorizing upper limb motor outcomes at the late subacute and chronic stages of stroke using a subset of ARAT tasks. METHODS This study retrospectively analyzed ARAT scores obtained in-person at 3 months poststroke from 333 patients. In-person ARAT scores were used to categorize patients' 3-month upper limb outcome using classification systems with 3, 4, and 5 outcome categories. Individual task scores from in-person assessments were then used in classification and regression tree analyses to determine subsets of tasks that could accurately categorize upper limb outcome for each of the 3 classification systems. The decision trees developed using 3-month ARAT data were also applied to in-person ARAT data obtained from 157 patients at 6 months poststroke. RESULTS The classification and regression tree analyses produced decision trees requiring 2 to 4 ARAT tasks. The overall accuracy of the cross-validated decision trees ranged from 87.7% (SE, 1.0%) to 96.7% (SE, 2.0%). Accuracy was highest when classifying patients into one of 3 outcome categories and lowest for 5 categories. The decision trees are referred to as FOCUS (Fast Outcome Categorization of the Upper Limb After Stroke) assessments and they remained accurate for 6-month poststroke ARAT scores (overall accuracy range 83.4%-91.7%). CONCLUSIONS A subset of ARAT tasks can accurately categorize upper limb motor outcomes after stroke. Future studies could investigate the feasibility and accuracy of categorizing outcomes using the FOCUS assessments remotely via video call.","Jordan, Harry T; Che, Joia; Byblow, Winston D; Stinear, Cathy M",Stroke,407,1

Despite their widespread use, there are limited evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for postoperative opioid prescribing. The Non-Opioid Prescriptions after Arthroscopic Surgery in Canada (NO PAin) Trial is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to determine whether a non-opioid analgesia approach to postoperative pain, compared to usual care, reduces oral morphine equivalents (OME) consumed in patients undergoing outpatient knee and shoulder arthroscopy. METHODS This is a multi-centre, RCT with a target sample size of 200 patients. Adult (18+ years of age) patients undergoing outpatient knee and shoulder arthroscopy will be randomized to a non-opioid postoperative protocol (intervention) or the current standard of care (control). The intervention will consist of a standardized non-opioid analgesic prescription, a limited rescue opioid prescription, and a patient education infographic. The control is defined as the treating surgeons' pre-trial postoperative analgesic regimen. Exclusion criteria include chronic opioid use, concomitant open surgery, contraindications to the prescribed analgesics or ongoing workers compensation/litigation. The primary outcome is OMEs consumed at 6 weeks postoperatively. Secondary outcomes will include patient-reported pain and satisfaction, quantity of OMEs prescribed, number of opioid refills, and any adverse events up to 6 weeks postoperatively. Utilizing the intention to treat principle for all analyses, independent samples t-test and presented with a p-value as well as a mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be performed for primary and secondary outcomes. DISCUSSION The ongoing opioid epidemic and overprescribing of opioids in orthopaedics serve as the rationale for this trial. There is a lack of evidence upon which to develop post-operative pain management guidelines for patients undergoing arthroscopic surgery. A prospective evaluation of this relatively inexpensive intervention will demonstrate whether an explicit effort to reduce the number of opioids prescribed results in a reduction in the amount of opioids consumed and help to inform future studies and guidelines.

DESIGN Retrospective study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2). SETTING Seven institutions in Italy. PATIENTS Forty-six patents with early cervical cancer (FIGO stage IA2-IB1/IIA1) were included in the study. Nineteen patients (41.3%) underwent LESS-RH, and 27 (58.7%) underwent mLPS-RH. Pelvic lymph node dissection was performed in all patients. INTERVENTIONS In the LESS-RH group, all surgical procedures were performed through a single umbilical multichannel port. In the mLPS-RH group, the procedure was completed using a 5-mm umbilical optical trocar and 3 additional 3-mm ancillary trocars, placed suprapubically and in the left and right lower abdominal regions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS There was no difference in clinicopathologic characteristics at the time of diagnosis between the LESS-RH and mLPS-RH groups. Median operative time was 270 minutes (range, 149-380 minutes) for LESS-RH, and was 180 minutes (range, 90-240 minutes) for mLPS-RH (p = .001). No further differences were detected between the 2 groups insofar as type of radical hysterectomy, number of lymph nodes removed, or perioperative outcomes. In the LESS-RH group, conversion to laparotomy was necessary in 1 patient (5.3%) because of external iliac vein injury, and in another patient, conversion to standard laparoscopy was required because of truncal obesity. In the mLPS-RH group, no conversions were observed; however, a repeat operation was performed to repair a ureteral injury. The percentage of patients discharged 1 day after surgery was significantly higher in the LESS-RH group (57.9%) compared with the mLPS-RH group (25.0%) (p = .03). After a median follow-up of 27 months (range, 9-73 months), only 1 patient, who had undergone mLPS-RH, experienced pelvic recurrence and died of the disease. CONCLUSIONS Both LESS-RH and mLPS-RH are feasible ultra-minimally invasive approaches for performance of radical hysterectomy plus pelvic lymph node dissection. Further technical improvements are required to enable wider use of these techniques for more complex procedures.","Fagotti, Anna; Ghezzi, Fabio; Boruta, David M; Scambia, Giovanni; Escobar, Pedro; Fader, Amanda N; Malzoni, Mario; Fanfani, Francesco",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,407,13

Ethical healthcare policies ensure equitable access to care for patients regardless of whether they have COVID-19 or another disease. Because healthcare resources are limited, a cost per Quality Life Year (QALY) approach to COVID-19 policy should also be considered. Policies that focus solely on mitigating COVID-19 are likely to be ethically or financially unsustainable. A cost/QALY approach could target resources to optimally improve QALYs. For example, most COVID-19 deaths occur in long-term care facilities, and this problem is likely better addressed by a focused long-term care reform than by a society-wide non-pharmacological intervention. Likewise, ramping up elective, non-COVID-19 care in low prevalence regions while expanding testing and case tracking in hot spots could reduce excess mortality from non-COVID-19 diseases and decrease adverse financial impacts while controlling the epidemic.

Many harm reduction programs continue to support people who use illicit drugs (PWUD) during the pandemic, yet PWUD working in harm reduction programs (sometimes termed 'peers') experience precarious labour conditions characterized by low wages, minimal employee benefits (such as paid sick leave) and high employment insecurity. Along with precarious labour conditions, PWUD face heightened vulnerabilities to COVID-19 and yet have been largely overlooked in global response to the pandemic. Operating under conditions of economic and legal precarity, harm reduction programs' reliance on precarious labour (e.g. on-call, temporary and unpaid work) renders some services vulnerable to staffing shortages and service disruptions during the pandemic, while also heightening the risk of virus transmission among workers, service users and their communities.

Although highly pathogenic to their spillover hosts, bats harbor these viruses, and a large number of other viruses, with little or no clinical signs of disease. How bats asymptomatically coexist with these viruses is unknown. In particular, little is known about bat adaptive immunity, and the presence of functional MHC molecules is mostly inferred from recently described genomes. In this study, we used an affinity purification/mass spectrometry approach to demonstrate that a bat MHC class I molecule, Ptal-N*01:01, binds antigenic peptides and associates with peptide-loading complex components. We identified several bat MHC class I-binding partners, including calnexin, calreticulin, protein disulfide isomerase A3, tapasin, TAP1, and TAP2. Additionally, endogenous peptide ligands isolated from Ptal-N*01:01 displayed a relatively broad length distribution and an unusual preference for a C-terminal proline residue. Finally, we demonstrate that this preference for C-terminal proline residues was observed in Hendra virus-derived peptides presented by Ptal-N*01:01 on the surface of infected cells.

Adolescence is an important period to promote preconception health, but education resources need to be age- and culturally-appropriate. Few studies have addressed preconception awareness and knowledge among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth, and few culturally appropriate resources exist. METHODS A mixed methods, co-design process engaging Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth and an Indigenous Reference Group (IRG). Additionally, a survey was carried out to identify preconception health awareness and interest among a broader youth audience. RESULTS Several main themes emerged from consultation meetings with youth reflecting an awareness of preconception health, but limited understanding. Youth revealed an interest in fertility, and a need for more information on lifestyle factors associated with infertility. Preconception information related to the opposite sex was seen as important as well as information incorporating current local knowledge and world views. Among the survey respondents, 46% (11/24) had a pre-existing understanding of pre-conception health. Optimising lifestyle behaviours prior to pregnancy was perceived as important for women (21/24; 88%), but less so for men (16/24; 67%), highlighting a gap in knowledge regarding the importance of preconception health for men. CONCLUSION The co-designed resource 'Getting healthy before pregnancy' is available in print and electronically, with illustrations and synchronised audio overlay in Aboriginal English or East-side Kriol. The resource includes information on preconception health and behavioural risk factors. SO WHAT We present a co-designed preconception health resource for evaluation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth.","Gilbert, Emily; Collins, Raelene; Webster, Vanya; Boyd, Nicole; Maple-Brown, Louise; Boyle, Jacqueline; Smith-Vaughan, Heidi",Health promotion journal of Australia : official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,407,19

An ongoing study (NCT#03410485) evaluates the intraoperative combination of both NOL and bispectral (BIS) indices to improve quality of recovery after colorectal surgery. Our ethical committee (REB approval #CER15083) initially agreed on an interim analysis of the data from the first 30 patients. More specifically, this present report analyzed all the intravenous phenylephrine (PE) boluses administered during anesthesia as part of our study protocol to see whether they had a significant impact on NOL values as well as other parameters: HR, MAP, BIS index. For this trial, remifentanil and phenylephrine were given in both groups based on a specific algorithm. All study parameters were recorded electronically. Our analysis for the present specific outcome evaluated NOL index for 30 s before the intravenous PE bolus (1 µg kg-1) was given and until 5 min afterwards. The average NOL values after PE bolus, as well as MAP, HR and BIS indices, were recorded and analyzed. A total of 178 events of PE boluses were identified for 28 patients (two were excluded). Median baseline NOL was 3 (1.8-8.3) CI 95% 5.7-8.7; post-PE bolus: 5.3 (2.7-9.9) (95% CI 6.6-8.9; Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test (WMPSRT), P = 0.0003). When analyzing delta NOL (difference between pre- and post-PE bolus in NOL values) for each patient, the median delta NOL was 2.9 (1.2-6.1) (95% CI 3.6-5.5) with 95% of the subjects keeping a delta NOL under 10. MAP and HR values showed expected significant variations after PE bolus: a slight increase and slight decrease, respectively. BIS index values did not change after PE bolus. Our present results demonstrate that intravenous phenylephrine boluses of 1 µg kg-1 had the expected impact on hemodynamic parameters: a significant but very slight increase in MAP and decrease in HR, which might lack clinical relevance. Our report also demonstrates that these same phenylephrine boluses induce a statistically significant increase of the NOL index which does not seem to have much of a clinical relevance for the novel NOL index used to monitor intraoperative nociception as well as for the more classical BIS index for depth of anesthesia. Nevertheless, doses of intravenous PE bolus used in the present study (1 µg kg-1) might be regarded as smaller than more conventional ones (100-200 µg per bolus). Further studies need to be done with the latter doses.","Raft, Julien; Coulombe, Marie-Andrée; Renaud-Roy, Etienne; Tanoubi, Issam; Verdonck, Olivier; Fortier, Louis-Philippe; Espitalier, Fabien; Richebe, Philippe",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,407,16

We bench-tested the triggering, battery duration, and tidal volume (V(T)) of 7 portable ventilators: LTV 1000, LTV 1200, Puritan Bennett 540, Trilogy, Vela, iVent 101, and HT50. METHODS We tested triggering with a modified dual-chamber test lung to simulate spontaneous breathing with weak, normal, and strong inspiratory effort. We measured battery duration by fully charging the battery and operating the ventilator with a V(T) of 500 mL, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and PEEP of 5 cm H(2)O until breath-delivery ceased. We tested V(T) accuracy with pediatric ventilation scenarios (V(T) 50 mL or 100 mL, respiratory rate 50 breaths/min, inspiratory time 0.3 s, and PEEP 5 cm H(2)O) and an adult ventilation scenario (V(T) 400 mL, respiratory rate 30 breaths/min, inspiratory time 0.5 s, and PEEP 5 cm H(2)O). We measured and analyzed airway pressure, volume, and flow signals. RESULTS At the adult settings the measured V(T) range was 362-426 mL. On the pediatric settings the measured V(T) range was 51-182 mL at the set V(T) of 50 mL, and 90-141 mL at the set V(T) of 100 mL. The V(T) delivered by the Vela at both the 50 mL and 100 mL, and by the HT50 at 100 mL, did not meet the American Society for Testing and Materials standard for V(T) accuracy. Triggering response and battery duration ranged widely among the tested ventilators. CONCLUSIONS There was wide variability in battery duration and triggering sensitivity. Five of the ventilators performed adequately in V(T) delivery across several settings. The combination of high respiratory rate and low V(T) presented problems for 2 of the ventilators.","Blakeman, Thomas C; Rodriquez, Dario; Hanseman, Dennis; Branson, Richard D",Respiratory care,407,24

This study used an internet-based questionnaire survey to determine parents' willingness to get their children (0 to 15 years) vaccinated in Japan and was conducted in April 2021 before COVID-19 vaccination for children began. Socio-demographic information, information about parents' willingness to get children vaccinated, reasons for their responses, and parents' willingness to get themselves vaccinated were obtained. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate parents' willingness to get children vaccinated based on the other variables. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the characteristics of parents who indicated willingness to get their children vaccinated and to identify the reasons for vaccine willingness. Of the 1100 respondents, 472 were willing to get children vaccinated, 470 were not sure, and 158 did not want to get children vaccinated. Considerable differences were found in the willingness to get children vaccinated across gender, age groups, occupation, annual income, respondent's academic background, and respondent's willingness to get COVID-19 vaccination for themselves. Reasons for being unsure about the vaccination included the vaccine's potential side effects (84.9%), uncertainty about vaccine safety (54.7%), and not trusting vaccine efficiency (25.7%). Parents' willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine for themselves was a significant factor for their willingness to get children vaccinated after adjusting all other factors. The study recommends disseminating more and correct information to the public to increase vaccine willingness.","Yoda, Takeshi; Katsuyama, Hironobu",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,407,1

The recovery was initially unremarkable, and the standard postoperative drops of dexamethasone and chloramphenicol (non-preservative free) were prescribed. The child presented 8 days postoperatively with fever, right upper lid swelling and ptosis. She was admitted for intravenous antibiotics for suspected pre-septal cellulitis. Over the next 2 days, she deteriorated with bilateral lid involvement. An examination under anesthesia (EUA) revealed bilateral corneal epithelial (dendritic and geographical) ulcers with conjunctival erosions and pseudo membranes prompting a diagnosis of HSK. This was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. The child recovered within 2 weeks after starting oral and topical antiviral medication. This case highlights the importance of EUA in infections not responding to standard treatment. Although HSK is known to occur after topical steroid use and ocular surgery, we were not able to find any other cases in the literature and believe this is the first reported case of bilateral HSK in the immediate postoperative period after strabismus surgery.","Berman, Tasmin; O'Connor, Anna; Yeo, Damien C M; Nayak, Harish",Strabismus,407,31

We observed drastic changes of CCR1, CXCR3, and CXCR4 expression and function during progression from precursor NK (pNK) cells to immature DX5- NK (iNK) and mature DX5+ NK (mNK) cells. pNK and mNK cells expressed the 3 receptors, while only CXCR4 was detected on iNK cells. Correspondingly, mNK cells migrated to CXCL12, CXCL10, and CCL3, and pNK and iNK cells to CXCL12, whereas pNK cells migrated to CCL3 and CXCL10 only after CXCL12 stimulation. Comparison of BM, peripheral blood, and spleen mNK cell populations revealed that CXCL12, CXCL10, and CCL3 preferentially affected BM mNK cell migration. Administration of the CXCR4 antagonist, AMD-3100, to C57BL/6 mice induced strong reduction of mNK and iNK cells in the BM and increased their number in blood and spleen. Conversely, CCL3 administration selectively mobilized mNK cells from the BM and this effect correlated with its ability to inhibit CXCL12-mediated mNK cell responses in vitro. Our results suggest that the combined action of chemokines selectively regulates localization of NK cell subsets in the BM and direct their maturation and migration to the periphery.","Bernardini, Giovanni; Sciumè, Giuseppe; Bosisio, Daniela; Morrone, Stefania; Sozzani, Silvano; Santoni, Angela",Blood,407,1

However, the risks of hyperoxemia caused by excessive O2 supply have not been sufficiently appreciated. Because nasal inhalation is mostly used for oxygen therapy, the pulmonary capillaries are often the first to be damaged by hyperoxia, causing many serious consequences. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism by which hyperoxia injures pulmonary capillary endothelial cells (LMECs) has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we systematically investigated these issues using next-generation sequencing and functional research techniques by focusing on non-coding RNAs. Our results showed that hyperoxia significantly induced apoptosis and profoundly affected the transcriptome profiles of LMECs. Hyperoxia significantly up-regulated miR-181c-5p expression, while down-regulated the expressions of NCAPG and lncRNA-DLEU2 in LMECs. Moreover, LncRNA-DLEU2 could bind complementarily to miR-181c-5p and acted as a miRNA sponge to block the inhibitory effect of miR-181c-5p on its target gene NCAPG. The down-regulation of lncRNA-DLEU2 induced by hyperoxia abrogated its inhibition of miR-181c-5p function, which together with the hyperoxia-induced upregulation of miR-181c-5p, all these significantly decreased the expression of NCAPG, resulting in apoptosis of LMECs. Our results demonstrated a ceRNA network consisting of lncRNA-DLEU2, miR-181c-5p and NCAPG, which played an important role in hyperoxia-induced apoptosis of vascular endothelial injury. Our findings will contribute to the full understanding of the harmful effects of hyperoxia and to find ways for effectively mitigating its deleterious effects.","Wu, Jizhi; Zhang, Guangqi; Xiong, Hui; Zhang, Yuguang; Ding, Gang; Ge, Junfeng",Scientific reports,407,26

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that oscillations in NIR signals at the respiratory and cardiac frequency could be attributed to venous and arterial blood, respectively, and thereby isolated. After written informed consent was obtained, a two-wavelength NIRS device was placed over the left frontal cortex in 20 volunteers. After 5 min of unimpeded spontaneous ventilation, an impedance threshold device (ITD, average resistance-7 cm H2O) was applied and an additional two minutes of data recorded. Tissue saturation (StO2) calculated at the ventilatory and cardiac frequencies was compared to non-pulsatile StO2, before and after application of the ITD using spectral peak and power algorithms. The ITD increased non-pulsatile cerebral saturation by 3.6 %. The ITD had no discernable effect on pulsatile estimates of StO2 at either the ventilatory or cardiac frequencies. StO2 estimated at the NIRS spectral peak from 0.75 to 1.75 Hz was 24 % higher than non-pulsatile StO2 (p = 0.0013). There were no other significant differences between pulsatile and non-pulsatile algorithms in the estimation of StO2. In 64 % of cases, both the low (ventilator) and high (cardiac) frequency estimates of StO2 were either both larger or both smaller than non-pulsatile StO2, suggesting that they were interrogating the same vascular bed.

Important for the conservation of this species is understanding the physiological and ecological impacts contributing to their population decline, and current studies lack information on embryonic development. Changes in patterns of salinity across the SFBD may be a particularly important environmental stressor contributing to the recruitment and survival of the species. Throughout their ontogeny, delta smelt may exhibit unique requirements and tolerances to environmental conditions including salinity. Here, we describe 22 stages of embryonic development of H. transpacificus that characterize early differentiation from the fertilized egg until hatching, allowing the identification of critical morphological features unique to this species. Additionally, we investigated aspects of physiological tolerance to environmental salinity during development. Embryos survived incubation at salinity treatments between 0.4 and 20 ppt, yet had lower hatch success at higher salinities. Prior to hatching, embryos exposed to higher salinities had increased osmolalities and reduced fractions of yolk implying that the elevated external salinity altered the physiology of the embryo and the environment internal to the chorion. Lastly, egg activation and fertilization appear to also be impacted by salinity. Altogether, we suggest that any potential tolerance to salinity during embryogenesis, a common feature in euryhaline teleost species, impacts life cycle transitions into, and out of, embryonic development. Results from this investigation should improve conservation and management practices of this species and further expand our understanding of the intimate relationship between an embryo and its environment.","Romney, Amie L T; Yanagitsuru, Yuzo R; Mundy, Paige C; Fangue, Nann A; Hung, Tien-Chieh; Brander, Susanne M; Connon, Richard E",Aquaculture,407,1

A search of reference lists of included studies and Google Scholar (first 200 citations published online between 2000 and February 2016) was also undertaken. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool (EPHPP). 2 study authors independently screened and extracted data with disagreements resolved via consensus. RESULTS Of the 5167 studies identified, 3 were eligible and included in the review. Trial designs of included studies were 2 randomised controlled trials and 1 non-randomised controlled trial. 2 studies received a weak methodological rating and 1 received a moderate methodological rating. The trials examine the impact of the following interventions: (1) nurse delivered cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) via telephone and accompanied by a workbook, combined with pharmacotherapy; (2) nurse and physician brief advice to quit and information booklets combined with pharmacotherapy; and (3) surgeon delivered enhanced advice to quit smoking augmented by booster sessions. Only the trial of the nurse delivered CBT and pharmacotherapy reported significant increases in smoking cessation rates. 1 study measured quit attempts and the other assessed consumption of cigarettes per day and readiness to change. There was no significant improvement in quit attempts or cigarettes smoked per day among patients in the intervention groups, relative to control. CONCLUSIONS There are very few studies evaluating the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions that report results specific to the HNC population.

METHODS The testes of four NMRI mice were extracted for further detergent-based decellularization process. We isolated, cultured, and clarified neonate mouse SSC, and a three-dimensional scaffold was prepared for SSCs culture. The loaded SSCs and hydrogel-based scaffold were investigated by several studies including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), 3-[4, 5-dimethyl (thiazol-2yl)-3,5diphenyl] tetrazolium bromide (MTT), Acridine orange, and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. RESULTS The efficiency of decellularization process was confirmed by DAPI, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and Masson's Trichrome staining. Acridine orange also depicted SSCs proliferation and viability. SEM approved the preservation of ECM components and also showed complex, coiled, and tubular seminiferous tubules, with intact and condensed collagenous form of the tunica albuginea. MTT test also revealed the scaffold's non-toxicity. Expression of PLZF, TP1, and TEKT1 markers also verified the capacity of SSCs proliferation on a cogel scaffold. CONCLUSION In conclusion, cogel scaffold consisting of DTM, HA, and chitosan may provide the supporting layer for in vitro SSC differentiation and proliferation.","Naeemi, Sahar; Eidi, Akram; Khanbabaee, Ramezan; Sadri-Ardekani, Homan; Kajbafzadeh, Abdol-Mohammad",International urology and nephrology,407,25

Twenty-four aneurysms (11.6%) were small, 162 (78.3%) were large and 21 (10.1%) were giant. The median clinical follow-up time was 6.2 months. The neurological morbidity rate was 6.8% (13/191), and the neurological mortality rate was 1.6% (3/191). The combined neurological morbidity/mortality rate was 6.8% (13/191). The most common adverse events were ischemic stroke (4.7%, 9/191) and spontaneous ICH (3.7%, 7/191). The complete occlusion rate at the last follow-up was 74.8% (77/103). CONCLUSIONS Our prospective postmarket study confirms that PED treatment of aneurysms in a heterogeneous patient population is safe with low rates of neurological morbidity and mortality. Patients with angiographic follow-up had complete occlusion rates of 75% at 8 months.","Kallmes, David F; Brinjikji, Waleed; Boccardi, Edoardo; Ciceri, Elisa; Diaz, Orlando; Tawk, Rabih; Woo, Henry; Jabbour, Pascal; Albuquerque, Felipe; Chapot, Rene; Bonafe, Alain; Dashti, Shervin R; Delgado Almandoz, Josser E; Given, Curtis; Kelly, Michael E; Cross, DeWitte T; Duckwiler, Gary; Razack, Nasser; Powers, Ciaran J; Fischer, Sebastian; Lopes, Demetrius; Harrigan, Mark R; Huddle, Daniel; Turner, Raymond; Zaidat, Osama O; Defreyne, Luc; Pereira, Vitor Mendes; Cekirge, Saruhan; Fiorella, David; Hanel, Ricardo A; Lylyk, Pedro; McDougall, Cameron; Siddiqui, Adnan; Szikora, Istvan; Levy, Elad",Interventional neurology,407,16

About 20% of critically ill patients with COVID-19 require renal replacement therapy (RRT). However, data on the prediction of acute kidney injury requiring RRT is lacking. Novel biomarkers, such as mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM) might be likely candidates for risk assessment due to its involvement during the initial phase of multiple organ dysfunction. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate MR-proADM for prediction of RRT in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS We analysed data of all consecutive patients with microbiologically confirmed COVID-19, requiring ICU admission at one of 12 intensive care units at a tertiary care university hospital in Germany between March and September 2020. Clinical characteristics including details on acute kidney injury, RRT, and survival were assessed. MR-proADM was measured as part of routine lab monitoring on admission to ICU. RESULTS 64 patients were included in the study. The median age was 62.5 (54 - 73) years; 49 patients (77%) were male. 47 (73%) patients were mechanically ventilated and 50 (78%) needed vasopressor therapy. 25 (39%) patients suffered from severe ARDS; veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was established in 10 patients. 29 (45%) patients required RRT during the ICU-stay; Median time from ICU admission to start of RRT was 2 (1 - 9) days. MR-proADM on ICU admission was significantly higher in patients requiring RRT (2.491 vs. 1.230 nmol/l; p = 0.002) and showed the highest correlation with SOFA renal subscore on day 1. ROC curve analysis showed that MR-proADM predicts RRT with an AUC of 0.685 (95% CI: 0.543 - 0.828; p = 0.019). In multivariable logistic regression MR-proADM was an independent predictor (OR: 3.813, 95% CI 1.110 - 13.102, p < 0.05) for the requirement of RRT. CONCLUSION Acute kidney injury requiring RRT is a frequent finding in critically ill patients with COVID-19. MR-proADM on admission to ICU was able to predict later requirement for RRT, which may be of interest for early risk stratification and patient management.","Roedl, Kevin; Jarczak, Dominik; Fischer, Marlene; Haddad, Munif; Boenisch, Olaf; de Heer, Geraldine; Burdelski, Christoph; Frings, Daniel; Sensen, Barbara; Karakas, Mahir; Kluge, Stefan; Nierhaus, Axel","Biomarkers : biochemical indicators of exposure, response, and susceptibility to chemicals",407,19

METHODS A prospective non-randomized, single institution study enrolled patients undergoing laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair. Acellular human dermis, FlexHD (Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation, Edison, NJ) or AlloDerm (LifeCell Inc., Branchburg, NJ) were used to buttress the repair after primary closure. A protocol barium swallow (BAS) was performed at 6 months and then as needed due to clinical indications. Primary outcome measure was recurrence. Patients completed preoperative and postoperative GERD symptom questionnaires and quality of life surveys (SF-36). Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, Student's t test, Fisher's exact test, or Wilcoxon signed-rank test were utilized as appropriate (p < 0.05 considered statistically significant). RESULTS Fifty-four patients (10 men and 44 women) with a mean age of 62 ± 10 years underwent laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair using Flex HD (n = 37) or AlloDerm (n = 17). Both groups were similar with respect to gender, age, hiatus size, hernia type [sliding/Type I (n = 14) or paraesophageal/Type III/IV (n = 40)], esophageal motor function (manometry), preoperative SF-36 quality of life surveys, and GERD symptom questionnaires. Forty-seven patients (87 %) completed the BAS at 6 months; each group had two recurrences (p = 0.597). At median follow-up of 33 months, there were 3 recurrences (18 %) in the AlloDerm group and 5 recurrences (14 %) in the Flex HD group (p = 0.365). Minimal differences in GERD symptoms or SF-36 scores were detected between groups. However, anti-reflux medication usage, GERD symptoms, and quality of life significantly improved for both groups after laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair with acellular human dermis reinforcement results in improvement of GERD-related symptoms and quality of life without mesh-associated complications. The type of acellular human dermis did not influence recurrence rate.","Ward, Kyle C; Costello, Kevin P; Baalman, Sara; Pierce, Richard A; Deeken, Corey R; Frisella, Margaret M; Michael Brunt, L; Matthews, Brent D",Surgical endoscopy,407,1

However, there are no published evidence-based recommendations to prevent contamination by lactated Ringer's solution (LRS). HYPOTHESIS Withdrawing 10 mL of blood from the LRS-containing extension set connected to the IV catheter before obtaining the sample for analysis should be adequate to obtain accurate measurement of blood lactate concentration (BLC). ANIMALS Thirty-three adult hospitalized horses receiving constant rate infusion of LRS. METHODS Immediately after disconnecting the LRS, 5 sequential 5 mL blood samples were obtained by aspiration from an extension set connected to an indwelling IV catheter, followed by 3 samples collected by direct venipuncture of the contralateral jugular vein. Samples were analyzed with 1 portable blood lactate analyzer. A linear mixed model was used to examine differences in lactate concentrations among samples collected from the catheter and by direct venipuncture. RESULTS After considering differences in age, breed, sex, and reason for hospitalization, BLCs were higher (P < .001) in the first and second 5 mL samples collected through the extension set/catheter than in all other extension set/catheter samples or the direct venipuncture samples. The largest difference observed between the third and subsequent catheter or venipuncture samples was 0.34 mmol/L with an upper 95% CI of 1.12 mmol/L. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE Withdrawing 15 mL of blood from a LRS-containing extension set connected to an IV catheter (5.9 mL total volume capacity) before obtaining the sample for blood lactate analysis is suggested to optimize accuracy of BLC measurements.","Marqués, F J; Higgins, S; Chapuis, R; Waldner, C",Journal of veterinary internal medicine,407,17

In recent years, Canadian health care organizations have faced large-scale systemic medical errors, a nation-wide generic injectable drug shortage, iatrogenic infectious disease outbreaks, and myriad other crises. These situations often have an ethical component that ethics consultants may be able to address. Organizational leaders such as health care managers and governing boards have responsibilities to oversee and direct the response to crisis situations. This study investigates the nature and degree of involvement of Canadian ethics consultants in such situations. METHODS This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews with Canadian ethics consultants to investigate the nature of their interactions with upper-level managers and governing board members in health care organizations, particularly in times of organizational crisis. We used a purposive sampling technique to identify and recruit ethics consultants throughout Canada. RESULTS We found variability in the interactions between ethics consultants and upper-level managers and governing boards. Some ethics consultants we interviewed did not participate in managing organizational crisis situations. Most ethics consultants reported that they had assisted in the management of some crises and that their participation was usually initiated by managers. Some ethics consultants reported the ability to bring issues to the attention of upper-level managers and indirectly to their governing boards. The interactions between managers and ethics consultants were characterized by varying degrees of collegiality. Ethics consultants reported participating in or chairing working groups, participating in incident management teams, and developing decision-making frameworks. CONCLUSIONS Canadian ethics consultants tend to believe that they have valuable skills to offer in the management of organizational crisis situations. Most of the ethics consultants we interviewed believed that they play an important role in this regard.","Kaposy, Chris; Maddalena, Victor; Brunger, Fern; Pullman, Daryl; Singleton, Richard",AJOB empirical bioethics,407,1

OBJECTIVES Assess the effect of glycemic control on BMA;correlate the parameters of BH with BMA and correlate BMA with the use of hypoglycemic agents and with BMD. DESIGN, SETTINGS AND PATIENTS This was a cross-sectional study that evaluated 26 premenopausal women with T2DM were divided into groups with HbA1c<7% (GC,n=10) and HbA1c>7% (PC,n=16).BMA parameters (Ad.N, Ad.Pm, Ad.Ar, Ad.V/Ma.V and peri-trabecular adipocyte number (Ad.N/BS) were evaluated.BH static(BV/TV, O.Th, OS/BS) and dynamic parameters and serum IGF-1 were measured.BMA data were compared between the GC vs PC groups. Correlations were performed. RESULTS Ad.N, Ad.Pm and Ad.Ar were higher in PC(all, p=0.04). HbA1c correlated positively with Ad.N/BS(p< 0.01) and Ad.N/BS correlated negatively with O.Th(p<0.01) and OS/BS(p=0.02). Positive and negative correlations were observed between insulin and metformin use, respectively, with all adipocyte parameters except Ad.N/BS(p<0.05). Structural parameters were negatively correlated with the BMA. BMD of the femoral neck(r = -549, p<0.01) and total femur(r=-0.502, p<0.01) were negatively correlated with Ad.V/Ma.V. CONCLUSION Poor glycemic control is associated with hyperplasia and hypertrophy of BMAs and with lower BVTV. Ad,N/BS, a new BMA parameter, is correlated with HbA1c and negatively with O.Th. The use of insulin seems to stimulate the expansion of BMA while that of metformin has the opposite effect. These findings suggest that the increase in BMA may play a role in the T2DM bone disease, on the other hand, good glycemic control might help prevent it.","Andrade, Vicente F C; Besen, Débora; Chula, Domingos C; Borba, Victória Z C; Dempster, David; Moreira, Carolina Aguiar",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,407,19

The current state-of-the-art deep learning models for radiology applications consider only pixel-value information without data informing clinical context. Yet in practice, pertinent and accurate non-imaging data based on the clinical history and laboratory data enable physicians to interpret imaging findings in the appropriate clinical context, leading to a higher diagnostic accuracy, informative clinical decision making, and improved patient outcomes. To achieve a similar goal using deep learning, medical imaging pixel-based models must also achieve the capability to process contextual data from electronic health records (EHR) in addition to pixel data. In this paper, we describe different data fusion techniques that can be applied to combine medical imaging with EHR, and systematically review medical data fusion literature published between 2012 and 2020. We conducted a systematic search on PubMed and Scopus for original research articles leveraging deep learning for fusion of multimodality data. In total, we screened 985 studies and extracted data from 17 papers. By means of this systematic review, we present current knowledge, summarize important results and provide implementation guidelines to serve as a reference for researchers interested in the application of multimodal fusion in medical imaging.","Huang, Shih-Cheng; Pareek, Anuj; Seyyedi, Saeed; Banerjee, Imon; Lungren, Matthew P",NPJ digital medicine,407,19

Little data exist on the experiences of young people accessing gender care. This systematic review and meta-ethnography aimed to identify and synthesise data on youths' experiences accessing gender-affirming healthcare. METHOD A systematic review and meta-ethnography focusing on qualitative research on the experiences of transgender and non-binary youth accessing gender care was completed between April-December 2020. The following databases were used: PsychINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO, international prospective register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42020139908). RESULTS Ten studies were included in the final review. The sample included participants with diverse gender identities and included the perspective of parents/caregivers. Five dimensions (third-order constructs) were identified and contextualized into the following themes: 1.) Disclosure of gender identity. 2.) The pursuit of care. 3.) The cost of care. 4.) Complex family/caregiver dynamics. 5.) Patient-provider relationships. Each dimension details a complicated set of factors that can impact healthcare navigation and are explained through a new conceptual model titled ""The Rainbow Brick Road"". CONCLUSION This synthesis expands understanding into the experience of transgender and non-binary youth accessing gender-affirming healthcare. Ryvicker's behavioural-ecological model of healthcare navigation is discussed in relation to the findings and compared to the authors' conceptual model. This detailed analysis reveals unique insights on healthcare navigation challenges and the traits, resources, and infrastructure needed to overcome these. Importantly, this paper reveals the critical need for more research with non-binary youth and research which includes the population in the design.","Kearns, Seán; Kroll, Thilo; O'Shea, Donal; Neff, Karl",PloS one,407,1

We assessed the effect of structured pre-visit preparatory telephone calls on success of telehealth visits and examined risk factors for unsuccessful visits. METHODS A retrospective cohort study was carried out of 45,803 adult patients scheduled for a total of 64,447 telehealth appointments between March and July 2020 at an academic medical center. A subset of patients received a structured pre-visit phone call. Demographic factors and inclusion of a pre-visit call were analysed by logistic regression. Primary outcomes were non-completion of any visit and completion of phone-only versus audio-visual telehealth visits. RESULTS A pre-visit telephone call to a subset of patients significantly increased the likelihood of a successful telehealth visit (OR 0.54; 95% CI: 0.48-0.60). Patients aged 18-30 years, those with non-commercial insurance or those of Black race were more likely to have incomplete visits. Compared to age 18-30, increasing age increased likelihood of a failed video visit: 31-50 years (OR 1.31; 95% CI: 1.13-1.51), 51-70 years (OR 2.98; 2.60-3.42) and >70 years (OR 4.16; 3.58-4.82). Those with non-commercial insurance and those of Black race (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.67-1.92) were more likely to have a failed video visit.

Very few reports have described ENPT to manage duodenal defects. This study was designed to demonstrate ENPT in a population of 11 patients with transmural duodenal leakages. Patients and methods The method of ENPT was adapted for duodenal use. Open-pore polyurethane-foam or a thin, open-pore double-layered film was wrapped around the distal end of a gastroduodenal tube. First, this open-pore element was placed on the inner wound in the duodenum with endoscopy. Second, continuous negative pressure of -125 mmHg was applied with an electronic pump. Drains were changed after 2 to 7 days. Results Eleven patients were treated with duodenal leaks. Eight defects occurred after operative closure of perforated duodenal ulcers, papillectomy or stricturoplasty, one anastomotic leakage after Billroth - 1 distal gastric resection, one iatrogenic perforation in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and one by a surgical drain. Median duration of therapy was 11 days (range 7 - 24 days). Complete healing of defects was achieved in all patients.

To elucidate the genetic determinants of seed protein plasticity, major seed proteins from 200 ecotypes of M. truncatula grown in four contrasting environments were quantified after one-dimensional electrophoresis. The plasticity index of these proteins was recorded for each genotype as the slope of Finlay and Wilkinson's regression and used for Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), enabling the identification of candidate genes determining this plasticity. This list was enriched in genes related to transcription, DNA repair, and signal transduction, many of them being stress-responsive. Other over-represented genes were related to sulfur and aspartate family pathways leading to the synthesis of the nutritionally essential amino acids methionine and lysine. By placing these genes in metabolic pathways, and using a M. truncatula mutant impaired in regenerating methionine from S-methylmethionine, we discovered that methionine recycling pathways are major contributors to globulin composition establishment and plasticity. These data provide a unique resource of genes that can be targeted to mitigate negative impacts of environmental stresses on seed protein composition.","Cartelier, Kevin; Aimé, Delphine; Ly Vu, Joseph; Combes-Soia, Lucie; Labas, Valérie; Prosperi, Jean-Marie; Buitink, Julia; Gallardo, Karine; Le Signor, Christine",The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology,407,26

Chronic pain, with a prevalence of 20-30% is the major cause of human suffering worldwide, because effective, specific and safe therapies have yet to be developed. It is unevenly distributed among sexes, with women experiencing more pain and suffering. Chronic pain can be anatomically and phenomenologically dissected into three separable but interacting pathways, a lateral 'painfulness' pathway, a medial 'suffering' pathway and a descending pain inhibitory pathway. One may have pain(fullness) without suffering and suffering without pain(fullness). Pain sensation leads to suffering via a cognitive, emotional and autonomic processing, and is expressed as anger, fear, frustration, anxiety and depression. The medial pathway overlaps with the salience and stress networks, explaining that behavioural relevance or meaning determines the suffering associated with painfulness. Genetic and epigenetic influences trigger chronic neuroinflammatory changes which are involved in transitioning from acute to chronic pain. Based on the concept of the Bayesian brain, pain (and suffering) can be regarded as the consequence of an imbalance between the two ascending and the descending pain inhibitory pathways under control of the reward system. The therapeutic clinical implications of this simple pain model are obvious. After categorizing the working mechanisms of each of the available treatments (pain killers, psychopharmacology, psychotherapy, neuromodulation, psychosurgery, spinal cord stimulation) to 1 or more of the 3 pathways, a rational combination can be proposed of activating the descending pain inhibitory pathways in combination with inhibition of the medial and lateral pathway, so as to rebalance the pain (and suffering) pathways.","De Ridder, Dirk; Adhia, Divya; Vanneste, Sven",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,407,19

LPS-induced HUVECs and HBMECs significantly increased the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and SELE in comparison with control groups (P<0.001). Treatment of LPS-induced HUVECs and HBMECs by aqueous extract and saponin fraction of TT decreased the expression of all three mentioned genes significantly (P<0.001) in comparison with LPS-induced cells. Taken together, our data suggest that TT has an anti-inﬂammatory effect. In vivo study about anti-inﬂammatory effect of this herb may provide new insights into the development of a herbal drug for the prevention/therapy of atherosclerosis.","Fereydouni, Zahra; Amirinezhad Fard, Elahe; Mansouri, Kamran; Mohammadi Motlagh, Hamid-Reza; Mostafaie, Ali",International journal of molecular and cellular medicine,407,2

METHODS A sub-analysis of a prospective, multicenter non-representative cohort study conducted in 162 ICUs in 24 countries. RESULTS Of the 1156 patients with hospital-acquired bloodstream infections (HA-BSI) included in the EUROBACT study, 96 patients had a HAF. Median time to its diagnosis was 20 days (IQR 10.5-30.5) and 9 days (IQR 3-15.5) after hospital and ICU admission, respectively. Median time to positivity of blood culture was longer in fungemia than in bacteremia (48.7 h vs. 38.1 h; p = 0.0004). Candida albicans was the most frequent fungus isolated (57.1%), followed by Candida glabrata (15.3%) and Candida parapsilosis (10.2%). No clear source of HAF was detected in 33.3% of the episodes and it was catheter-related in 21.9% of them. Compared to patients with bacteremia, HAF patients had a higher rate of septic shock (39.6% vs. 21.6%; p = 0.0003) and renal dysfunction (25% vs. 12.4%; p = 0.0023) on admission and a higher rate of renal failure (26% vs. 16.2%; p = 0.0273) at diagnosis. Adequate treatment started within 24 h after blood culture collection was less frequent in HAF patients (22.9% vs. 55.3%; p < 0.001). The 28-day all cause fatality was 40.6%. According to multivariate analysis, only liver failure (OR 14.35; 95% CI 1.17-175.6; p = 0.037), need for mechanical ventilation (OR 8.86; 95% CI 1.2-65.24; p = 0.032) and ICU admission for medical reason (OR 3.87; 95% CI 1.25-11.99; p = 0.020) were independent predictors of 28-day mortality in HAF patients. CONCLUSIONS Fungi are an important cause of hospital-acquired BSI in the ICU. Patients with HAF present more frequently with septic shock and renal dysfunction on ICU admission and have a higher rate of renal failure at diagnosis. HAF are associated with a significant 28-day mortality rate (40%), but delayed adequate antifungal therapy was not an independent risk factor for death. Liver failure, need for mechanical ventilation and ICU admission for medical reason were the only independent predictors of 28-day mortality.","Paiva, José-Artur; Pereira, José Manuel; Tabah, Alexis; Mikstacki, Adam; de Carvalho, Frederico Bruzzi; Koulenti, Despoina; Ruckly, Stéphane; Çakar, Nahit; Misset, Benoit; Dimopoulos, George; Antonelli, Massimo; Rello, Jordi; Ma, Xiaochun; Tamowicz, Barbara; Timsit, Jean-François",Critical care,407,1

Currently, only 17% of mothers attend such birth centres. The objective of this work was to examine the feasibility of consolidation of birth centres, from the perspectives of birth centre size and travel times for mothers. DESIGN Computer-based optimisation. SETTING Hospital-based births. POPULATION OR SAMPLE 1.91 million admissions in 2014-2016. METHODS A multiple-objective genetic algorithm. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Travel time for mothers and size of birth centres. RESULTS Currently, with 161 birth centres, 17% of women attend a birth centre with at least 6000 admissions per year. We estimate that 95% of women have a travel time of 30 min or less. An example scenario, with 100 birth centres, could provide 75% of care in birth centres with at least 6000 admissions per year, with 95% of women travelling 35 min or less to their closest birth centre. Planning at local level leads to reduced ability to meet admission and travel time targets. CONCLUSIONS While it seems unrealistic to have all births in birth centres with at least 6000 admissions per year, it appears realistic to increase the percentage of mothers attending this type of birth centre from 17% to about 75% while maintaining reasonable travel times. Planning at a local level leads to suboptimal solutions.","Allen, Michael; Villeneuve, Emma; Pitt, Martin; Thornton, Steve",BMJ open,407,1

The potential benefits and complications of both techniques remain unclear when used together. Our aim was to assess the safety and long-term angiographic outcomes of stenting after BAC. METHODS Retrospective review of 87 unruptured wide necked aneurysms (in 80 patients) treated with BAC and requiring stent placement at the final stage of the procedure due to coil prolapse. Aneurysm characteristics, technical issues, clinical records, and MR results were assessed. Post-treatment and follow-up angiograms were evaluated by two independent reviewers and categorized as ""stable,"" ""further thrombosis,"" or ""recanalization."" RESULTS The mean maximum diameter was 9.1 ± 4.7 mm and aspect ratio 1.20 ± 0.47. Complete and near-complete initial occlusion were observed in 53 (60.9%) and 28 (32.2%) of all treated aneurysms, respectively. Angiographic follow-up (80 aneurysms; mean, 34.68 ± 25.26 months) revealed stability and further thrombosis in 92.4% (74/80). Recanalization was observed in six cases (7.5%, 6/83), four of which were retreated. No significantly different outcomes were found in terms of aneurysm size (p = 0.641). Transient and reversible procedure-related complications occurred in eight (9.2%), minor permanent deficits in 2.3%, and major deficits, including death, in four cases (4.6%). CONCLUSION Our results suggest that treatment of wide-necked aneuryms with stent placement after BAC yields low recanalization rates and enhanced angiographic outcomes in long-term follow-up.","Velasco González, Aglaé; Stracke, P; Nordmeyer, H; Heddier, M; Saleme, S; Sauerland, C; Berkemeyer, S; Buerke, B; Heindel, W; Chapot, R",Neuroradiology,407,27

Understanding whether patient demand will last after the pandemic helps providers and payers make informed decisions about whether to continue adopting telemedicine. Objective: We examine user experience as well as process and patient outcomes of using telemedicine for acute conditions during COVID-19 and assess how patient outcomes are affected by waiting times and demographics. Materials and Methods: A survey was conducted via Amazon Mechanical Turk during June 17-29, 2020. Inclusion criteria were: (1) ≥18 years old, (2) residing in the United States, (3) used telemedicine for acute conditions after January, and 4) a human intelligence task approval rate of >95%. Process outcomes included patient waiting time with patient outcomes being satisfaction and future use intention. Bivariate analysis and regressions of the data were performed. Results: On average, respondents reported appointment wait time of 2.76 days and virtual office wait time of 19.44 min. Overall, respondents reported moderate satisfaction (mean 5.08-5.35 of 7) and future use intention (mean 5.10-5.32 of 7). Over 72% of the respondents were satisfied and had future use intention. Females, heavier internet users, and those on the higher/lower ends of the education spectrum reported better patient outcomes. Patients ""visiting"" a doctor experiencing eye problems, vis-à-vis other ailments, reported lower satisfaction and intention. Waiting time negatively associates with satisfaction. Conclusions: Given the satisfactory outcomes, the high demand for telemedicine may continue after the COVID-19 pandemic. However, whether providers will continue to offer telemedicine visits may require more evidence.","Kato-Lin, Yi-Chin; Thelen, Shawn T",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,407,30

Among HBV factors, the surface protein is the most sensitive biomarker for viral infection, given that it is expressed at high levels in all viral infection phases. The large HBV surface protein (LHBs) contains the integral pre-S1 domain, which binds to the HBV receptor sodium taurocholate co transporting polypeptide on the hepatocyte to facilitate viral entry. The accumulation of viral LHBs and its prevalent pre-S mutants in chronic HBV carriers triggers a sustained endoplasmic reticulum (ER) overload response, leading to ER stress-mediated cell proliferation, metabolic switching and genomic instability, which are associated with pro-oncogenic effects. Ground glass hepatocytes identified in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients harbor pre-S deletion variants that largely accumulate in the ER lumen due to mutation-induced protein misfolding and are associated with increased risks of cancer recurrence and metastasis. Moreover, in contrast to the major HBs, which is decreased in tumors to a greater extent than it is in peritumorous regions, LHBs is continuously expressed during tumorigenesis, indicating that LHBs serves as a promising biomarker for HCC in people with CHB. Continuing efforts to delineate the molecular mechanisms by which LHBs regulates pathological changes in CHB patients are important for establishing a correlation between LHBs biomarkers and HCC development.","Lin, Wei-Ling; Hung, Jui-Hsiang; Huang, Wenya",Cells,407,1

And other questions answered.,15.91056,4.3397536,2021-02-15,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The analysis of the pulsation of unruptured intracranial aneurysms might improve the assessment of their stability and risk of rupture. Pulsations can easily be concealed due to the small movements of the aneurysm wall, making post-processing highly demanding. We hypothesized that the quantification of aneurysm pulsation is technically feasible and can be improved by computer-aided post-processing. MATERIALS AND METHODS Images of 14 cerebral aneurysms were acquired with an ECG-triggered 4D CTA. Aneurysms were post-processed manually and computer-aided on a 3D model. Volume curves and random noise-curves were compared with the arterial pulse wave and volume curves were compared between both post-processing modalities. RESULTS The aneurysm volume curves showed higher similarity with the pulse wave than the random curves (Hausdorff-distances 0.12 vs 0.25, p<0.01). Both post-processing methods did not differ in intra- (r = 0.45 vs r = 0.54, p>0.05) and inter-observer (r = 0.45 vs r = 0.54, p>0.05) reliability. Time needed for segmentation was significantly reduced in the computer-aided group (3.9 ± 1.8 min vs 20.8 ± 7.8 min, p<0.01). CONCLUSION Our results show pulsatile changes in a subset of the studied aneurysms with the final prove of underlying volume changes remaining unsettled. Semi-automatic post-processing significantly reduces post-processing time but cannot yet replace manual segmentation.","Illies, Till; Saering, Dennis; Kinoshita, Manabu; Fujinaka, Toshiyuki; Bester, Maxim; Fiehler, Jens; Tomiyama, Noriyuki; Watanabe, Yoshiyuki",PloS one,407,24

It is, therefore, integral to identify patients who may benefit from biventricular support early post-LVAD implantation. Our objective was to explore the performance of risk prediction models for RVF in adult patients undergoing LVAD implantation. METHODS A systematic search was performed on Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception until August 2019 for all relevant studies. Performance was assessed by discrimination (via C statistic) and calibration if reported. Study quality was assessed using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool criteria. RESULTS After reviewing 3878 citations, 25 studies were included, featuring 20 distinctly derived models. Five models were derived from large multicenter cohorts: the European Registry for Patients With Mechanical Circulatory Support, Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support, Kormos, Pittsburgh Bayesian, and Mechanical Circulatory Support Research Network RVF models. Seventeen studies (68%) were conducted in cohorts implanted with continuous-flow LVADs exclusively. The definition of RVF as an outcome was heterogenous among models. Seven derived models (28%) were validated in at least 2 cohorts, reporting limited discrimination (C-statistic range, 0.53-0.65). Calibration was reported in only 3 studies and was variable. CONCLUSIONS Existing RVF prediction models exhibit heterogeneous derivation and validation methodologies, varying definitions of RVF, and are mostly derived from single centers. Validation studies of these prediction models demonstrate poor-to-modest discrimination. Newer models are derived in cohorts implanted with continuous-flow LVADs exclusively and exhibit modest discrimination. Derivation of enhanced discriminatory models and their validations in multicenter cohorts is needed.","Frankfurter, Claudia; Molinero, Micaela; Vishram-Nielsen, Julie K K; Foroutan, Farid; Mak, Susanna; Rao, Vivek; Billia, Filio; Orchanian-Cheff, Ani; Alba, Ana Carolina",Circulation.

PNT was previously postulated to be localized to the highly divergent mitochondrion-related organelle, the mitosome, in the anaerobic/microaerophilic protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica based on the potential mitochondrion-targeting signal. However, our previous proteomic study of isolated phagosomes suggested that PNT is localized to organelles other than mitosomes. An immunofluorescence assay using anti-E. histolytica PNT (EhPNT) antibody raised against the NADH-binding domain showed a distribution to the membrane of numerous vesicles/vacuoles, including lysosomes and phagosomes. The domain(s) required for the trafficking of PNT to vesicles/vacuoles was examined by using amoeba transformants expressing a series of carboxyl-terminally truncated PNTs fused with green fluorescent protein or a hemagglutinin tag. All truncated PNTs failed to reach vesicles/vacuoles and were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. These data indicate that the putative targeting signal is not sufficient for the trafficking of PNT to the vesicular/vacuolar compartments and that full-length PNT is necessary for correct transport. PNT displayed a smear of >120 kDa on SDS-PAGE gels. PNGase F and tunicamycin treatment, chemical degradation of carbohydrates, and heat treatment of PNT suggested that the apparent aberrant mobility of PNT is likely attributable to its hydrophobic nature. PNT that is compartmentalized to the acidic compartments is unprecedented in eukaryotes and may possess a unique physiological role in E. histolytica.","Yousuf, Mohammad Abu; Mi-ichi, Fumika; Nakada-Tsukui, Kumiko; Nozaki, Tomoyoshi",Eukaryotic cell,407,26

There are differences between the sensitivity and specificity of these tests due to the usage of different viral target proteins and antibody subclasses. In order to evaluate the diagnostic use of these tests, we aimed to examine the diagnostic performance, especially sensitivity and specificity, of SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgA and IgG tests of various companies (Abbott, Roche, Euroimmun, Dia.Pro, Anshlabs, Vircell, UnScience and RedCell), which have different principles (ECLIA/CLIA, EIA, LFA). Current (n= 180) and past (n= 180) COVID-19 patients with clinical and molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to Istanbul University-Cerrahpaşa, Cerrahpaşa Faculty of Medicine Hospital, Pandemic Polyclinic with suspected COVID-19 infection, were included in our study. The patients admitted within the first 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms were included in the current patient group, and those admitted at the third and after the third week were included in the past patient group. Serum samples (n= 180) obtained from Istanbul Sisli Hamidiye Etfal Training and Research Hospital, Blood Center between April and June 2018 before the COVID-19 pandemic were included in the study as a control group. All the tests included in our study were studied with the recommendations of the manufacturer companies. Between the IgG detection tests with different principles in patients with past COVID-19, the sensitivity and specificity values of the most effective tests were; 86.7%/99.4% (Abbott), 86.1%/98.9% (Dia.Pro), 91.3%/95% (RedCell). Between the IgM detection tests with different principles in current COVID-19 patients, the sensitivity and specificity values were; 67.8%/99.4% (Abbott), 68.9%/98.6% (Vircell), 50%/97.5% (RedCell). Abbott IgM with a kappa coefficient of 0.67 and Vircell IgM + IgA test with a kappa coefficient of 0.65 showed the best fit in patients with current COVID-19 infection. In patients with past COVID-19, Abbott IgG with 0.86 kappa coefficient and Dia.Pro IgG test with 0.85 kappa coefficient showed the best match. Due to the low sensitivity of IgM detection antibody tests, they should not be preferred instead of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in routine diagnosis. IgG detection tests may be preferred to detect the antibody response and the titers in people who have had COVID-19 for population seroprevalence and especially therapeutic immune plasma production. However, it is thought that the combined use of both ECLIA/CLIA-based and EIA/ELISA-based tests together may be more effective in routine use for SARS-CoV-2 IgG tests.","Dinç, Harika Öykü; Özdemir, Yusuf Emre; Alkan, Sena; Güngördü Dalar, Zeynep; Gareayaghi, Nesrin; Sirekbasan, Serhat; Tuyji Tok, Yeşim; Kuşkucu, Mert Ahmet; Karaali, Rıdvan; Özbey, Doğukan; Aygün, Gökhan; Midilli, Kenan; Kocazeybek, Bekir",Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,407,1

Selective cerebral hypothermia applied early, prior to and during endovascular mechanical recanalization therapy, may be beneficial in the critical phase of reperfusion. We aimed to assess the feasibility of a new intracarotid cooling catheter in an animal model. MATERIALS AND METHODS Nine adult sheep were included. Temperature probes were introduced into the frontal and temporal brain cortices bilaterally. The cooling catheter system was introduced into a common carotid artery. Selective blood cooling was applied for 180 minutes. Systemic and local brain temperatures were measured during cooling and rewarming. Common carotid artery diameters and flow were measured angiographically and by Doppler sonography. RESULTS The common carotid artery diameter was between 6.7 and 7.3 mm. Common carotid artery blood flow velocities increased moderately during cooling and after catheter removal. Maximum cerebral cooling in the ipsilateral temporal cortex was -4.7°C (95% CI, -5.1 to -4.0°C). Ipsilateral brain temperatures dropped significantly faster and became lower compared with the contralateral cortex with maximum temperature difference of -1.3°C (95% CI, -1.5 to -1.0°C; P < .0001) and compared with systemic temperature (-1.4°C; 95% CI, -1.7 to -1.0°C; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS Sheep proved a feasible animal model for the intracarotid cooling catheter.

BACKGROUND The anthrax attack on the USA in 2001 resulted in the development of global response strategies for future bioterrorist events. However, despite these actions, it remains unclear whether nurses are prepared to respond to such events. DATA SOURCES A search for relevant research articles was conducted using the MEDLINE, CINAHL, BNI, and EMBASE databases to locate articles published in the period 1996-March 2010. DESIGN Narrative synthesis. REVIEW METHODS A narrative synthesis of qualitative and quantitative studies was undertaken and the articles reviewed using Greenhalgh's critical appraisal criteria. The review was conducted with inclusion and exclusion criteria applied to ensure the studies examined focussed on the hospital nurse's role in responding to a bioterrorist event. RESULTS Seven original research studies were included in the review. Four themes were identified as affecting nurses' preparedness for a bioterrorist attack. These were perceptions of bioterrorism, the role of formal knowledge, the role of institutional plans and policies, and personal factors. The overarching theme centred on nurses' willingness to respond to a bioterrorist event. It was clear that, although nurses were willing to respond to a bioterrorist attack, they felt unprepared to do so. CONCLUSIONS Existing nurse education in areas such as infection control can incorporate bioterrorism training to improve preparedness, yet nurses must also prepare themselves personally for a bioterrorist attack.","Smith, Claire; Hewison, Alistair",Journal of advanced nursing,407,31

We evaluated the safety and effectiveness of en bloc ligation of the renal pedicle using a stapler during laparoscopic nephrectomy and nephroureterectomy. METHODS Ninety patients underwent en bloc renal hilar ligation using 45-mm endo-gastrointestinal anastomosis stapler and 2.5-mm staples during laparoscopic nephrectomy and nephroureterectomy from 2002 to 2015. Perioperative outcomes including estimated blood loss, operative time, and perioperative complications were documented. RESULTS Twenty-seven patients underwent nephrectomy and 63 patients underwent nephroureterectomy. Thirty patients (33.3%) had perioperative complications. The majority of complications were of Clavien grade II. Six patients had Clavien Dindo grade III and none of the patients had grade IV complications. There were no significant differences in complication rates between right- and left-sided procedures (p = 0.233). Median blood loss was 190.1 ml and mean operative time was 227.1 minutes in nephrectomy and 256.6 minutes in nephroureterectomy. None of the patients had evidence of AVF formation on postoperative computerized tomography scan. Only three patients had a new diagnosis of heart failure. One of them was eventually lost to follow up. The remaining two patients had no evidence of AVF formation in imaging studies and physical examination.

It is gaining visibility as a tool to address the evidence gaps that clinicians struggle with every day; however, CER is particularly challenging in oncology as there is great variability in how individuals respond to interventions, and a wide range of drugs and procedures are available. In order to overcome these obstacles and conduct reliable CER studies, it is critical to create a robust data infrastructure to support it.The Center for Medical Technology Policy held its first annual CER Summit in November 2010, with a particular focus on oncology. A number of critical informatics themes emerged including the need for consistent data standards, registry reform, tools to assist trial accrual, and data to integrate into value deliberations.

Current approaches to detect B.1.1.7 include sequencing and RT-qPCR tests containing a target assay that fails or results in reduced sensitivity towards the B.1.1.7 variant. Since many countries lack genomic surveillance programs and failed assays detect unrelated variants containing similar mutations as B.1.1.7, we used allele-specific PCR, and judicious placement of LNA-modified nucleotides to develop an RT-qPCR test that accurately and rapidly differentiates B.1.1.7 from other SARS-CoV-2 variants. We validated the test on 106 clinical samples with lineage status confirmed by sequencing and conducted a country-wide surveillance study of B.1.1.7 prevalence in Slovakia. Our multiplexed RT-qPCR test showed 97% clinical sensitivity and retesting 6,886 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples obtained during three campaigns performed within one month, revealed pervasive spread of B.1.1.7 with an average prevalence of 82%. Labs can easily implement this test to rapidly scale B.1.1.7 surveillance efforts and it is particularly useful in countries with high prevalence of variants possessing only the ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion because current strategies using target failure assays incorrectly identify these as putative B.1.1.7 variants.","Boršová, Kristína; Paul, Evan D; Kováčová, Viera; Radvánszka, Monika; Hajdu, Roman; Čabanová, Viktória; Sláviková, Monika; Ličková, Martina; Lukáčiková, Ľubomíra; Belák, Andrej; Roussier, Lucia; Kostičová, Michaela; Líšková, Anna; Maďarová, Lucia; Štefkovičová, Mária; Reizigová, Lenka; Nováková, Elena; Sabaka, Peter; Koščálová, Alena; Brejová, Broňa; Staroňová, Edita; Mišík, Matej; Vinař, Tomáš; Nosek, Jozef; Čekan, Pavol; Klempa, Boris",Scientific reports,407,19

Laparoscopic surgery with single-port laparoscopy (SPL) is a laparoscopic surgery technique that is based on making a single parietal incision using a single trocar specifically designed to allow introduction of several instruments. The level of evidence regarding the advantages of SPL in terms of postoperative pain has remained low despite several randomized studies. Adult patients exhibiting a surgical indication for an a priori benign ovarian pathology or for prophylactic purposes that can be performed by laparoscopy will be randomized to receive conventional laparoscopy (CL) or SPL. The aim of our study is to evaluate whether SPL offers advantages over CL in benign adnexal surgery. METHODS The patients will be evaluated preoperatively to confirm their eligibility. The perioperative data up to 24 h after the intervention, as well as the postoperative data at day 7 and at one month from the intervention will be collected. The primary outcome for the study will be the postoperative pain at 24 h ± 2 h after the intervention. The pain will be assessed by a numeric rating scale of 0-10. Other outcomes will also be assessed, such as pain at other times, the consumption of analgesics, the operative time, perioperative bleeding, the number of additional trocars in the two groups, the incidence of laparoconversion, the esthetic criteria of the scar at one month, the incidence of complications, and the quality of life at one month. DISCUSSION If our hypothesis is confirmed, this study will provide evidence that the use of SPL can decrease postoperative pain in adnexal surgery. The standard surgical treatment of this condition would thus be modified. TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02739724 .

This is even more alarming as obesity increases the COVID-19 severity. However, the relationship between obesity and COVID-19 severity is more complex than a simple association with BMI. In particular, obesity has been associated with low death rates in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, a fatal comorbidity to COVID-19, possibly due to the obesity paradox. Also, visceral adiposity could be a major risk factor for COVID-19 severity, due to its immune activation component, release of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and involvement in the cytokine storm, hypercoagulability and embolism. A poor antioxidant nutritional status also weakens the immune system, increasing inflammation and infection risk. Moreover, the COVID-19 lockdown might impact lifestyle patterns, mental health and weight bias, worsening the obesity then COIVD-19 situation. On the other hand, health care expenses and productivity loss are expected to increase during the concomitant epidemics. The co-occurrence of obesity and COVID-19 is a major challenge at both public health and economic levels that should urgently be taken into consideration. The identification of COVID-19 weight related risk factors and the development of appropriate weight management programs are needed to tackle the concomitant epidemics.","Dohet, François; Loap, Suva; Menzel, Alain; Iddir, Mohammed; Dadoun, Frédéric; Bohn, Torsten; Samouda, Hanen",International journal for vitamin and nutrition research.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective cohort study of 60 women of reproductive age was conducted. The main group consisted of 32 patients suffering from the symptomatic course of uterine fibroids who received treatment with HIFU ablation of uterine fibroids. The control group consisted of 28 healthy fertile women examined voluntarily. The endometrium obtained with pipelle biopsy on days 20-22 of the cycle was examined by scanning electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry before and three months after the treatment. The results were processed by the method of variation statistics using the SPSS 22.0. RESULTS The focused ultrasound rays passing through the endometrium did not cause any change in the maturation rate or the state of intercellular contacts. At the same time, a significant increase in the frequency of asynchronous maturation of pinopodia was found to be 14.28% before HIFU versus 50.00% after HIFU; p = .021 and the number of heteromorphic secretory cells 5.88% before HIFU versus 53.33% after HIFU; p = .002 in implantation endometrium. A significant decrease in the stromal expression of CD95+bright in the endometrium to the level comparable with control values was observed after HIFU (from 70.22 ± 9.77 c/s to 48.81 ± 5.47 c/s; p < .001; the control level - 47.80 ± 2.13 c/s). The ratio and expression of steroid receptors, proliferation markers, p53-dependent apoptosis and its blockers, regulators and markers of angiogenesis, LIF and LIF-R signaling molecules in the stroma and endometrial glands did not change significantly after treatment. CONCLUSION This study did not reveal any significant negative effects of HIFU ablation of uterine fibroids on endometrial receptivity in women of reproductive age.","Melkozerova, Oxana; Shchedrina, Irina; Gryshkina, Anastasia; Bashmakova, Nadezhda; Malgina, Galina; Michelson, Anna; Chistyakova, Guzel",Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology,407,12

Objective To determine if cell phone location data are associated with the rate of change in new COVID-19 cases by county across the US. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study incorporated publicly available county-level daily COVID-19 case data from January 22, 2020, to May 11, 2020, and county-level daily cell phone location data made publicly available by Google. It examined the daily cases of COVID-19 per capita and daily estimates of cell phone activity compared with the baseline (where baseline was defined as the median value for that day of the week from a 5-week period between January 3 and February 6, 2020). All days and counties with available data after the initiation of stay-at-home orders for each state were included. Exposures The primary exposure was cell phone activity compared with baseline for each day and each county in different categories of place. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the percentage change in COVID-19 cases 5 days from the exposure date. Results Between 949 and 2740 US counties and between 22 124 and 83 745 daily observations were studied depending on the availability of cell phone data for that county and day. Marked changes in cell phone activity occurred around the time stay-at-home orders were issued by various states. Counties with higher per-capita cases (per 100 000 population) showed greater reductions in cell phone activity at the workplace (β, -0.002; 95% CI, -0.003 to -0.001; P < 0.001), areas classified as retail (β, -0.008; 95% CI, -0.011 to -0.005; P < 0.001) and grocery stores (β, -0.006; 95% CI, -0.007 to -0.004; P < 0.001), and transit stations (β, -0.003, 95% CI, -0.005 to -0.002; P < 0.001), and greater increase in activity at the place of residence (β, 0.002; 95% CI, 0.001-0.002; P < 0.001). Adjusting for county-level and state-level characteristics, counties with the greatest decline in workplace activity, transit stations, and retail activity and the greatest increases in time spent at residential places had lower percentage growth in cases at 5, 10, and 15 days. For example, counties in the lowest quartile of retail activity had a 45.5% lower growth in cases at 15 days compared with the highest quartile (SD, 37.4%-53.5%; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance Our findings support the hypothesis that greater reductions in cell phone activity in the workplace and retail locations, and greater increases in activity at the residence, are associated with lesser growth in COVID-19 cases. These data provide support for the value of monitoring cell phone location data to anticipate future trends of the pandemic.","Sehra, Shiv T; George, Michael; Wiebe, Douglas J; Fundin, Shelby; Baker, Joshua F",JAMA internal medicine,407,7

This study aimed to describe specific pathophysiological characteristics of acute respiratory distress syndrome from coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN Prospective crossover physiologic study. SETTING ICU of a university-affiliated hospital from northern Italy dedicated to care of patients with confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019. PATIENTS Ten intubated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS We performed a two-step positive end-expiratory pressure trial with change of 10 cm H2O in random order. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS At each positive end-expiratory pressure level, we assessed arterial blood gases, respiratory mechanics, ventilation inhomogeneity, and potential for lung recruitment by electrical impedance tomography. Potential for lung recruitment was assessed by the recently described recruitment to inflation ratio. In a subgroup of seven paralyzed patients, we also measured ventilation-perfusion mismatch at lower positive end-expiratory pressure by electrical impedance tomography. At higher positive end-expiratory pressure, respiratory mechanics did not change significantly: compliance remained relatively high with low driving pressure. Oxygenation and ventilation inhomogeneity improved but arterial CO2 increased despite unchanged respiratory rate and tidal volume. The recruitment to inflation ratio presented median value higher than previously reported in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients but with large variability (median, 0.79 [0.53-1.08]; range, 0.16-1.40). The FIO2 needed to obtain viable oxygenation at lower positive end-expiratory pressure was significantly correlated with the recruitment to inflation ratio (r = 0.603; p = 0.05). The ventilation-perfusion mismatch was elevated (median, 34% [32-45%] of lung units) and, in six out of seven patients, ventilated nonperfused units represented a much larger proportion than perfused nonventilated ones. CONCLUSIONS In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome from coronavirus disease 2019, potential for lung recruitment presents large variability, while elevated dead space fraction may be a specific pathophysiological trait. These findings may guide selection of personalized mechanical ventilation settings.","Mauri, Tommaso; Spinelli, Elena; Scotti, Eleonora; Colussi, Giulia; Basile, Maria Cristina; Crotti, Stefania; Tubiolo, Daniela; Tagliabue, Paola; Zanella, Alberto; Grasselli, Giacomo; Pesenti, Antonio",Critical care medicine,407,31

However, predictors of change in CVD-RFs among adolescents have not yet been reported. METHODS The Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery study (NCT00474318) prospectively collected anthropometric and health status data on 242 adolescents undergoing MBS at 5 centers. Predictors of change in CVD-RFs (blood pressure, lipids, glucose homeostasis, and inflammation) 3 years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and vertical sleeve gastrectomy were examined. RESULTS The mean (±SD) age of participants at baseline was 17 ± 1.6 years; 76% were girls, and 72% were white, with a median BMI of 51. Participants underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n = 161), vertical sleeve gastrectomy (n = 67), or adjustable gastric banding (n = 14). Increasing weight loss was an independent predictor of normalization in dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure (EBP), hyperinsulinemia, diabetes, and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Older participants at time of surgery were less likely to resolve dyslipidemia compared with younger participants, whereas girls were more likely than boys to demonstrate improvements in EBP. Even those participants without frank dyslipidemia or EBP at baseline showed significant improvements in lipid and blood pressure values over time. CONCLUSIONS Numerous CVD-RFs improve among adolescents undergoing MBS. Increased weight loss, female sex, and younger age predict a higher probability of resolution of specific CVD-RFs. The elucidation of predictors of change in CVD-RFs may lead to refinements in patient selection and optimal timing of adolescent bariatric surgery designed to improve clinical outcomes.","Michalsky, Marc P; Inge, Thomas H; Jenkins, Todd M; Xie, Changchun; Courcoulas, Anita; Helmrath, Michael; Brandt, Mary L; Harmon, Carroll M; Chen, Mike; Dixon, John B; Urbina, Elaine M",Pediatrics,407,17

The effectiveness of teach-back has been underexamined, particularly for older patients discharged from the emergency department (ED). We aimed to determine whether teach-back would reduce ED revisits and whether it would increase patients' retention of discharge instructions, improve self-management at home and increase satisfaction with the provision of instructions. METHODS A nonrandomised pre-post pilot evaluation in the ED of one Dutch academic hospital including patients discharged from the ED receiving standard discharge care (pre) and teach-back (post). Primary outcomes were ED-revisits within 7 days and within 8-30 days postdischarge. Secondary outcomes for a subsample of older adults were retention of instructions, self-management 72 hours after discharge and satisfaction with the provision of discharge instructions. RESULTS A total of 648 patients were included, 154 were older adults. ED revisits within 7 days and within 8-30 days were lower in the teach-back group compared with those receiving standard discharge care: adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of 0.23 (95% CI 0.05 to 1.07) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.14 to 1.33), respectively. Participants in the teach-back group had an increased likelihood of full knowledge retention on information related to their ED diagnosis and treatment (AOR 2.19; 95% CI 1.01 to 4.75; p=0.048), medication (AOR 14.89; 95% CI 4.12 to 53.85; p>0.001) and follow-up appointments (AOR 3.86; 95% CI 1.33 to 10.19; p=0.012). Use of teach-back was not significantly associated with improved self-management and higher satisfaction with discharge instructions. Discharge conversations were generally shorter for participants receiving teach-back. CONCLUSIONS Discharging patients from the ED with a relatively simple and feasible teach-back method can contribute to safer and better transitional care from the ED to home.","Hesselink, Gijs; Sir, Özcan; Koster, Nadia; Tolsma, Carolien; Munsterman, Maartje; Olde Rikkert, Marcel; Schoon, Yvonne",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,407,1

However, the factors regulating the T cell pathogenic gene expression program remain unclear. Here, we investigated how the Ikaros transcription factor regulates the global gene expression and chromatin accessibility changes in murine T cells during Th17 polarization and after activation via the T cell receptor (TCR) and CD28. We found that, in both conditions, Ikaros represses the expression of genes from the pathogenic signature, particularly Csf2, which encodes GM-CSF. We show that, in TCR/CD28-activated T cells, Ikaros binds a critical enhancer downstream of Csf2 and is required to regulate chromatin accessibility at multiple regions across this locus. Genome-wide Ikaros binding is associated with more compact chromatin, notably at multiple sites containing NFκB or STAT5 target motifs, and STAT5 or NFκB inhibition prevents GM-CSF production in Ikaros-deficient cells. Importantly, Ikaros also limits GM-CSF production in TCR/CD28-activated human T cells. Our data therefore highlight a critical conserved transcriptional mechanism that antagonizes GM-CSF expression in T cells.","Bernardi, Chiara; Maurer, Gaëtan; Ye, Tao; Marchal, Patricia; Jost, Bernard; Wissler, Manuela; Maurer, Ulrich; Kastner, Philippe; Chan, Susan; Charvet, Céline",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,407,24

The aims of the present study were twofold: (i) to study the attitudes, emotional responses, and worries among the dental personnel; and (ii) to look for the ability of dental personnel to experience posttraumatic self-growth as a result of the distress caused by the pandemic. METHOD AND MATERIALS A cross-sectional online survey using an anonymous questionnaire was performed simultaneously in Israel, Canada, and France during the initial lockdown period. RESULTS Israeli dental practitioners were less worried about their physical health, mental health, or relationships with family and friends than their Canadian and French counterparts. The Canadian dental practitioners were most committed and most willing to treat their patients, as well as most concerned about not being able to treat patients in the same personal way as before the lockdown. French dental practitioners showed the highest level of fear to treat patients. There were no differences in dental practitioners' levels of anxiety, depression, or posttraumatic growth among the countries. Dental practitioners' posttraumatic growth was significantly associated with worries regarding their physical health. CONCLUSION Responses of dental personnel to the COVID-19 pandemic varied worldwide. Despite the differences, evidence exists that some of the dental practitioners' worries and concerns are associated with psychologic growth as a result of the pandemic. Better understanding and acknowledgment of dental personnel's worries and concerns can facilitate growth and enable positive functioning under the continuous situation of uncertainty.","Uziel, Nir; Gilon, Efrat; Meyerson, Joseph; Levin, Liran; Khehra, Anahat; Emodi-Perlman, Alona; Eli, Ilana",Quintessence international,407,7

An emerging body of research demonstrates that playing Pokémon Go can lead to improvements in physical activity and psychosocial well-being; however, whether Pokémon Go reduces self-harm incidence at the population-level is still questionable. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to quantify how the launch of Pokémon Go in Hong Kong affected the incidence of self-harm using a quasi-experimental design. METHODS An interrupted time-series design with Poisson segmented regression adjusted for time and seasonality trends was used on data from 2012 to 2018 to detect any changes in the number of accident and emergency attendances due to self-harm, after Pokémon Go was launched. The findings were validated using a baseline control period and using other intentional injuries and minor noninjuries as control outcomes. We also assessed intervention effects by age group. RESULTS From January 1, 2012 to July 31, 2018, there were 13,463 accident and emergency attendances due to self-harm in Hong Kong. During the period after launching Pokémon Go, self-harm attendances dropped by 34% (adjusted incidence rate ratio: 0.66, 95% CI 0.61-0.73). When analyzed by age group, a reduction in self-harm incidence was only apparent in adults (18 to 24 years of age: adjusted incidence rate ratio: 0.78, P=.02; 25 to 39 years of age: adjusted incidence rate ratio: 0.75, P<.001; 40 years of age and older: adjusted incidence rate ratio: 0.57, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS Self-harm incidence in the population, particularly in adults, showed a significant decline in the period after Pokémon Go was launched.

We therefore hypothesized that regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) would decrease significantly during the surgery. In addition, the influencing factors of rSO2 would be investigated. METHODS A total of 60 patients scheduled for selective totally thoracoscopic ablation for stand-alone atrial fibrillation were enrolled in this prospective observational study. The rSO2 was monitored at baseline (T0), 15 min after anesthesia induction (T1), 15 minute after 1-lung ventilation (T2), after right pulmonary vein ablation (T3), after left pulmonary vein ablation (T4) and 15 minute after 2-lung ventilation (T5) using a near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy -based cerebral oximeter. Arterial blood gas was analyzed using an ABL 825 hemoximeter. Associations between rSO2 and hemodynamic or blood gas parameters were determined with univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses. RESULTS The rSO2 decreased greatly from baseline 65.4% to 56.5% at T3 (P < .001). Univariate analyses showed that rSO2 correlated significantly with heart rate (r = -0.173, P = .186), mean arterial pressure (MAP, r = 0.306, P = .018), central venous pressure (r = 0.261, P = .044), arterial carbon dioxide tension (r = -0.336, P = .009), arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2, r = 0.522, P < .001), and base excess (BE, r = 0.316, P = .014). Multivariate linear regression analyses further showed that it correlated positively with PaO2 (β = 0.456, P < .001), MAP (β = 0.251, P = .020), and BE (β = 0.332, P = .003). CONCLUSION Totally thoracoscopic ablation for atrial fibrillation caused a significant decrease in rSO2. There were positive correlations between rSO2 and PaO2, MAP, and BE.","Li, Guohui; Yang, Liqiao; Sun, Yuan; Shen, Sai'e",Medicine,407,27

In the present work, we close a gap in the literature by computing the time delay during the proton tunneling. Our results, based on the well-known dwell time and our model of the entropic time, range from femtoseconds to picoseconds, and completely agree with the time scales of the structural changes in molecules (mutation processes not the complete replication processes). The tunneling delay times are thus nonnegligible and imply that the DNA mutations can be resolved using the attosecond laser technology, if not the femtosecond technology. Our results can be relevant also for other tunneling-enabled biological processes.","Çelebi, Gizem; Özçelik, Elif; Vardar, Emre; Demir, Durmuş",Progress in biophysics and molecular biology,407,23
142655,142655,142655,Dealing with Covid -19: Lessons from China.,15.628162,4.56121,2020,"BACKGROUND High rates of cannabis and illicit drug use are experienced by young people during the final stages of neurodevelopment (aged 15-24 years), a period characterized by high neuroplasticity. Frequent drug use during this time may interfere with neurophysiological and neuropsychological development pathways, potentially leading to ongoing unfavorable neuroadaptations. The dose-response relationship between illicit drug use, exposure, and individual neurodevelopmental variation is unknown but salient with global shifts in the legal landscape and increasingly liberal attitudes and perceptions of the harm caused by cannabis and illicit drugs. OBJECTIVE This systematic review aims to synthesize longitudinal studies that investigate the effects of illicit drug use on structural, functional, and cognitive brain domains in individuals under the neural age of adulthood (25 years). This protocol outlines prospective methods that will facilitate an exhaustive review of the literature exploring pre- and post-drug use brain abnormalities arising during neurodevelopment. METHODS Five electronic databases (Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, ProQuest Central, and Web of Science) will be systematically searched between 1990 and 2019. The search terms will be a combination of MeSH (Medical Subject Headings), with keywords adapted to each database. Study reporting will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and if relevant, study quality will be assessed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Eligible studies are those that sampled youth exposed to cannabis or illicit drugs and employed neurophysiological or neuropsychological assessment techniques. Studies will be excluded if participants had been clinically diagnosed with any psychiatric, neurological, or pharmacological condition. RESULTS This is an ongoing review. As of February 2020, papers are in full-text screening, with results predicted to be complete by July 2020. CONCLUSIONS Integrating data collected on the three brain domains will enable an assessment of the links between structural, functional, and cognitive brain health across individuals and may support the early detection and prevention of neurodevelopmental harm.

Objectives: This study examined the prospective relation of baseline financial strain (reported at the beginning of the pandemic) to problematic alcohol use one month later, as well as the moderating role of emotional nonacceptance. We hypothesized that financial strain would be more strongly associated with problematic alcohol use one month later among participants with high (vs. mean or low) levels of nonacceptance. Methods: Shortly after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO and national emergency by the U.S. President (on March 11 and 13, 2020, respectively), a U.S. nationwide community sample completed a prospective online study, including an initial assessment from March 27-April 5, 2020 and a one-month follow-up from April 27-May 21. Measures included the Family Economic Strain Scale, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Participants included 254 adults reporting some alcohol use (50.4% women; mean age = 41.8). Results: Baseline financial strain was significantly positively associated with problematic alcohol use one month later only among participants with high (b =.06, SE =.03, p =.037) versus mean (b =.01, SE =.02, p =.677) or low (b = -.04, SE =.02, p =.110) emotional nonacceptance. Conclusion: Individuals experiencing financial strain in the context of COVID-19 may be at risk for problematic alcohol use if they are not accepting of their emotional distress.","Gratz, Kim L; Scamaldo, Kayla M; Vidaña, Ariana G; Richmond, Julia R; Tull, Matthew T",The American journal of drug and alcohol abuse,407,12

Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has shown potential to detect retinal changes in several neurodegenerative diseases. We performed an exploratory study on the thickness of retinal layers as possible (early) biomarker in D-CAA mutation carriers. METHODS D-CAA mutation carriers (n=8 presymptomatic, n=13 symptomatic, median age 50 years) and (n=9, median age 53 years) controls were scanned using Spectral Domain OCT (SD-OCT). Symptomatic mutation carriers were defined as having a history of ≥1 symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. D-CAA mutation carriers and controls were recruited from our D-CAA cohort and a healthy control cohort. Total peripapillary Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (pRNFL) thickness, six regions of pRNFL, total macular volume (TMV), and individual macular regions thickness were measured and analyzed adjusted for age. RESULTS The overall median (IQR) thickness of pRNFL was decreased in symptomatic, but not presymptomatic D-CAA mutation carriers compared with controls (91µm (86-95) versus 99µm (87-108),p=0.006). Both presymptomatic (111µm (93-122) versus 131µm (123-143),p<0.001) and symptomatic carriers (119µm (95-128) versus 131µm (123-143),p=0.034) had a thinner temporal-superior quadrant of the pRNFL versus controls. TMV or individual macular layers thickness did not differ between carriers and controls. CONCLUSIONS Thinning of the Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer may be a candidate marker of disease in hereditary CAA. Further studies are needed to determine whether retinal thinning is present in sporadic CAA and estimate its value as marker for disease progression.","van Etten, Ellis S; de Boer, Irene; Steenmeijer, Sylvie R; Al-Nofal, Mays; Wermer, Marieke J H; Notting, Irene C; Terwindt, Gisela M",European journal of neurology,407,31

PIM family genes, including PIM1, PIM2, and PIM3, are proto-oncogenes that are aberrantly overexpressed in different types of human cancers. In this study, we aimed to explore and clarify the function of PIM3 in AML. Patients and Methods The expression of the three PIM genes in AML was detected using the Gene Expression Omnibus. The expression of PIM3 and PIM3 in patient samples and AML cell lines was measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or Western blot analyses. The cellular behaviors of PIM3-overexpressing AML cell lines were detected using a CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, Western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and a cell migration assay. The interactions between PIM3 and phosphorylated CXCR4 (pCXCR4) were explored via immunoprecipitation. Results Higher PIM3 expression was detected in primary AML cells than in healthy donor cells. Second, PIM3 overexpression promoted AML cell proliferation and protected against spontaneous apoptosis by phosphorylating BAD (pBAD) at Ser112. Furthermore, PIM3 overexpression might promote the migration of AML cells via CXCR4. PIM3-overexpressing AML cell lines exhibited increased CXCR4 phosphorylation at Ser339, and pCXCR4 interacted with PIM3. Conclusion Our findings suggest that PIM3 regulates the proliferation, survival, and chemotaxis of AML cell lines. Moreover, pCXCR4 might mediate the regulation of PIM3-induced chemotaxis. Therefore, the inhibition of PIM3 expression may be a promising therapeutic target in AML.","Luo, Hongmei; Sun, Ruixue; Zheng, Yuhuan; Huang, Jingcao; Wang, Fangfang; Long, Dan; Wu, Yu",OncoTargets and therapy,407,16

Although this metastatic tropism may reflect the mechanical trapping of circulating tumour cells, liver metastasis is also dependent, at least in part, on the formation of a 'pro-metastatic' niche that supports the spread of tumour cells to the liver2,3. The mechanisms that direct the formation of this niche are poorly understood. Here we show that hepatocytes coordinate myeloid cell accumulation and fibrosis within the liver and, in doing so, increase the susceptibility of the liver to metastatic seeding and outgrowth. During early pancreatic tumorigenesis in mice, hepatocytes show activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signalling and increased production of serum amyloid A1 and A2 (referred to collectively as SAA). Overexpression of SAA by hepatocytes also occurs in patients with pancreatic and colorectal cancers that have metastasized to the liver, and many patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease show increases in circulating SAA. Activation of STAT3 in hepatocytes and the subsequent production of SAA depend on the release of interleukin 6 (IL-6) into the circulation by non-malignant cells. Genetic ablation or blockade of components of IL-6-STAT3-SAA signalling prevents the establishment of a pro-metastatic niche and inhibits liver metastasis. Our data identify an intercellular network underpinned by hepatocytes that forms the basis of a pro-metastatic niche in the liver, and identify new therapeutic targets.","Lee, Jae W; Stone, Meredith L; Porrett, Paige M; Thomas, Stacy K; Komar, Chad A; Li, Joey H; Delman, Devora; Graham, Kathleen; Gladney, Whitney L; Hua, Xia; Black, Taylor A; Chien, Austin L; Majmundar, Krishna S; Thompson, Jeffrey C; Yee, Stephanie S; O'Hara, Mark H; Aggarwal, Charu; Xin, Dong; Shaked, Abraham; Gao, Mingming; Liu, Dexi; Borad, Mitesh J; Ramanathan, Ramesh K; Carpenter, Erica L; Ji, Ailing; de Beer, Maria C; de Beer, Frederick C; Webb, Nancy R; Beatty, Gregory L",Nature,407,31

STUDY DESIGN Canine cadaveric study; unbalanced paired design. ANIMALS Fresh canine cadavers (n = 30) METHODS: Experiment 1: Paired 7 cm diameter, circular skin-muscle-fascia specimens were harvested bilaterally from three sites (thorax, abdomen, and thigh) on 10 cadavers. For each pair, the skin-to-fascia was sutured with a circumferential continuous pattern in one specimen and left unsutured in the other during excision. Specimen length and width were measured post-excision and post-fixation. Specimen rotation, translation, and distortion was measured post-fixation. Experiment 2: A subcutaneous tumor model was implanted at 2 sites (neck, thorax) on 20 cadavers and specimens were then excised with 2 cm lateral margins and a deep fascial plane. Three suturing techniques of the skin-to-fascia at both sites were performed during excision: unsutured versus circumferential continuous suture (10 pairs) or circumferential versus 4 interrupted quadrant sutures (10 pairs). Lateral margins were compared post-excision and post-fixation. RESULTS Experiment 1: There was significant reduction in the length and width of the fascia and skin post-excision, but no further reduction after fixation. The circumferential suture decreased rotation and translation of the tissue layers but did not significantly affect specimen shrinkage or distortion compared with the unsutured specimen. Experiment 2: All 4 lateral margins decreased significantly post-excision and post-fixation compared with the planned pre-excision margins. No difference was found between any of the 4 lateral margins for any skin-to-fascia suture technique. CONCLUSION Canine skin-muscle-fascia specimens significantly decrease in size from gross pre-excision dimensions after removal. Suturing the specimen during surgery before excision will significantly improve alignment of tissue planes without creating distortion of the sample, but may alter the length, width, and lateral margins of the specimen.","Risselada, Marije; Mathews, Kyle G; Griffith, Emily",Veterinary surgery : VS,407,1

Methods A total of 200 consecutive patients undergoing Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon were prospectively evaluated using either the valveless trocar (n = 100) or standard trocars (n = 100). Patient demographics, intra-operative parameters, length of stay, presence or absence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, analog pain score at 0-6 hours, 6-12 hours, 12-18 hours, and >24 hours, and 30-day postoperative complications were analyzed. Results There were no significant differences in estimated blood loss, intra-operative urine output, length of stay, or 30-day complication rates between the two groups. While the VTS group had higher Body Mass Index (BMI) (28.45 vs. 27.23; P = 0.049), the operative time was significantly shorter in the VTS group (146 minutes vs. 167 minutes; P < .005). The VTS group experienced fewer episodes of nausea (2% vs. 10%; P = 0.0172).

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the impact of dexmedetomidine on emergence agitation (EA), the need for postoperative rescue analgesics, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and other adverse events in paediatric patients during CLP repair. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The quality of evidence was assessed by using the Cochrane Review Methods and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Data were screened, extracted and assessed by two independent authors. Outcomes were reported as a risk ratio (RR) with a 95% CI. A random-effect model was used when heterogeneity was detected. RESULTS Thirteen studies including 1040 children met the inclusion criteria. The incidence of EA was significantly decreased in the dexmedetomidine group (RR, 0.19; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.36; p<0.00001; I2=56%) as compared with the control group.

There were no significant differences in the risk of PONV and cardiovascular adverse events. CONCLUSIONS There was a lack of high-quality studies in this field. Perioperative administration of dexmedetomidine reduced the need for postoperative rescue analgesics and the incidence of EA in children without side effects undergoing CLP repair. However, further verification with larger samples and higher-quality RCTs is needed.","Liu, Dengfeng; Pan, Li; Gao, Yin; Liu, Jiefan; Li, Feng; Li, Xiangwei; Quan, Jiale; Huang, Congcong; Lian, Chunwei",BMJ open,407,16

Methods: We first estimated YLL from COVID-19 using WHO life tables, based on published age/sex data from COVID-19 deaths in Italy. We then used aggregate data on number/type of LTCs in a Bayesian model to estimate likely combinations of LTCs among people dying with COVID-19. We used routine UK healthcare data from Scotland and Wales to estimate life expectancy based on age/sex/these combinations of LTCs using Gompertz models from which we then estimate YLL.

After adjustment for number and type of LTCs, the mean YLL was slightly lower, but remained high (11.6 and 9.4 years for men and women, respectively). The number and type of LTCs led to wide variability in the estimated YLL at a given age (e.g. at ≥80 years, YLL was >10 years for people with 0 LTCs, and <3 years for people with ≥6). Conclusions: Deaths from COVID-19 represent a substantial burden in terms of per-person YLL, more than a decade, even after adjusting for the typical number and type of LTCs found in people dying of COVID-19. The extent of multimorbidity heavily influences the estimated YLL at a given age. More comprehensive and standardised collection of data (including LTC type, severity, and potential confounders such as socioeconomic-deprivation and care-home status) is needed to optimise YLL estimates for specific populations, and to understand the global burden of COVID-19, and guide policy-making and interventions.","Hanlon, Peter; Chadwick, Fergus; Shah, Anoop; Wood, Rachael; Minton, Jon; McCartney, Gerry; Fischbacher, Colin; Mair, Frances S; Husmeier, Dirk; Matthiopoulos, Jason; McAllister, David A",Wellcome open research,407,1

The seasonal occurrence, temporal-spatial variation, potential compound source(s), and a risk assessment of this watershed, which is the largest drinking water source in the country, were investigated. Clarithromycin was detected most frequently (72.2%) with the greatest median concentration (0.151 ± 0.072 μg L-1), followed by carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole. The seasonality of the pharmaceuticals was observed, with higher concentrations and detection frequencies in spring than in summer and autumn; this was possibly caused by lower levels of microbial activities associated with lower water temperatures than other seasons. In terms of geographical variation, urban areas had higher pharmaceutical concentrations than rural areas, which was attributed to the former's high population density and largest wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) regardless of season. The total concentration and detection frequency of WWTPs were 12.4 and 2.5 times higher in downstream sites than upstream sites, thereby conveying that WWTPs were the main source for the presence of pharmaceuticals in tributaries. According to the results produced from calculations of the risk quotient (RQ) of aquatic organisms, clarithromycin and sulfamethazine were identified as posing relatively high ecological risk (RQ > 1) during the spring that was identified for this study. This study can provide policymakers with scientific support for prioritizing pollutant management and collections of global data on emerging pollutants.","Im, Jong Kwon; Kim, Sang Hun; Noh, Hye Ran; Yu, Soon Ju",The Science of the total environment,407,29

DWI demonstrated incomplete infarction within the left lenticulostriate artery (LSA) territory, MRA showed partial flow defect in the distal left M1 segment and non-visualization of the LSA, and ECG revealed atrial fibrillation, thus ischemic stroke caused by cardiogenic embolism was diagnosed. Tissue plasminogen activator was administered, but symptoms progressed and NIHSS score increased up to 8. Diagnostic angiogrpahy confirmed presence of the subocclusive thrombus within the distal left M1 segment and complete occlusion of LSA at its origin. Since conservative therapy was ineffective, mechanical thrombectomy utilizing ADAPT (a direct aspiration first-pass thrombectomy) technique was performed resulting in compete recanalization of the LSA accompanied by the prompt regress of neurological symptoms.

In this study, we compared the use of genetically modified bioluminescent (GMB) bacteria whose luminescence increases in the presence of toxicants and Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells for the characterization of the toxicity of water samples collected from a lake and streams, hydroponic and aquaponic farms, and a wastewater treatment plant. GMB bacteria were used to probe genotoxicity, cytotoxicity and reactive oxygen species-induced effects in the whole water samples. Unlike GMB bacteria, the use of CHO cells requires XAD resin-based pre-concentration of toxic material present in water samples for the subsequent cytotoxicity assay. In addition to the examination of the toxicity of the water from the different sources, the GMB bacteria were also used to test the XAD extracts diluted to the concentrations causing 50% growth inhibition of the CHO cells. The two biomonitoring tools provided different results when they were used to test the above-mentioned diluted XAD extracts. A pre-concentration procedure based on adsorption by XAD resins with subsequent elution was not sufficient to represent the material responsible for the toxicity of the whole water samples toward the GMB bacteria. Therefore, the use of XAD resin extracts may lead to major underestimates of the toxicity of water samples. Although the toxicity findings obtained using the GMB bacteria and CHO cells may not correlate with each another, the GMB bacteria assay did provide a mechanism-specific biomonitoring tool to probe the toxicity of water samples without a need for the pre-concentration step.","Manivannan, Bhuvaneshwari; Massalha, Nedal; Halahlih, Fares; Eltzov, Evgeni; Nguyen, Thanh H; Sabbah, Isam; Borisover, Mikhail",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,407,5

METHODS AND MATERIALS We retrospectively identified all patients with benign SVC syndrome treated to stent placement between January 2003 and December 2015 (n = 59). Only cases with both clinical and imaging follow-up were included (n = 47). In 33 (70%) of the patients, the obstruction was due to a central line or pacemaker wires, and in 14 (30%), the cause was fibrosing mediastinitis. Covered stents were placed in 17 (36%) of the patients, and 30 (64%) patients had an uncovered stent. Clinical and treatment outcomes, complications, and the percent stenosis of each stent were evaluated. RESULTS Technical success was achieved in all cases at first attempt. Average clinical and imaging follow-up in years was 2.7 (range 0.1-11.1) (covered) and 1.7 (range 0.2-10.5) (uncovered), respectively. There was a significant difference (p = 0.044) in the number of patients who reported a return of symptoms between the covered (5/17 or 29.4%) and uncovered (18/30 or 60%) groups. There was also a significant difference (p = < 0.001) in the mean percent stenosis after stent placement between the covered [17.9% (range 0-100) ± 26.2] and uncovered [48.3% (range 6.8-100) ± 33.5] groups. No significant difference (p = 0.227) was found in the time (days) between the date of the procedure and the date of clinical follow-up where a return of symptoms was reported [covered: 426.6 (range 28-1554) ± 633.9 and uncovered 778.1 (range 23-3851) ± 1066.8]. One patient in the uncovered group had non-endovascular surgical intervention (innominate to right atrial bypass), while none in the covered group required surgical intervention. One major complication (SIR grade C) occurred that consisted of a pericardial hemorrhagic effusion after angioplasty that required covered stent placement. There were no procedure-related deaths. CONCLUSION Both covered and uncovered stents can be used for treating benign SVC syndrome. Covered stents, however, may be a more effective option at providing symptom relief and maintaining stent patency if validated by further studies.","Haddad, Mustafa M; Simmons, Benjamin; McPhail, Ian R; Kalra, Manju; Neisen, Melissa J; Johnson, Matthew P; Stockland, Andrew H; Andrews, James C; Misra, Sanjay; Bjarnason, Haraldur",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,407,12

In the present study, we performed an integrated analysis of metabonomics, proteomics and lipidomics to establish a scientific research system on the underlying mechanism of TCMs, and Schisandra lignan extract (SLE) was selected as a model TCM. In metabonomics, several metabolic pathways were found to mediate the liver injury induced by acetaminophen (APAP), and SLE could regulate the disorder of lipid metabolism. The proteomic study further proved that the hepatoprotective effect of SLE was closely related to the regulation of lipid metabolism. Indeed, the results of lipidomics demonstrated that SLE-dosing has an obvious callback effect on APAP-induced lipidic profile shift. The contents of 25 diglycerides (DAGs) and 21 triglycerides (TAGs) were enhanced significantly by APAP-induced liver injury, which could further induce liver injury and inflammatory response by up-regulating protein kinase C (PKCβ, PKCγ, PKCδ and PKCθ). The up-regulated lipids and PKCs could be reversed to the normal level by SLE-dosing. More importantly, phosphatidic acid phosphatase (lipin1), fatty acid transport protein 5 (FATP5) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) were proved to be positively associated with the regulation of DAGs and TAGs. Significance Statement Integrated multi-omics was first used to reveal the mechanism of APAP-induced acute liver failure (ALF) and hepatoprotective role of SLE. The results showed that the ALF caused by APAP was closely related to lipid regulation and SLE-dosing could exert hepatoprotective role by reducing intrahepatic DAG and TAG levels. Our research can not only promote the application of multi-component technology in the study of the mechanism of TCMs, but also provide an effective approach for the prevention and treatment of ALF.","Yan, Caixia; Guo, Huimin; Ding, Qingqing; Shao, Yuhao; Kang, Dian; Yu, Tengjie; Li, Changjian; Huang, Haoran; Du, Yisha; Wang, He; Hu, Kangrui; Xie, Lin; Wang, Guangji; Liang, Yan",Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,407,5

Therefore, adaptations to normal care pathways are required. Here, we establish if implementation of a bespoke peri-operative care bundle for urgent elective surgery during a pandemic surge period can deliver a low COVID-19-associated complication profile. We present a single-centre retrospective cohort study from a tertiary care hospital of patients planned for urgent elective surgery during the initial COVID-19 surge in the UK between 29 March and 12 June 2020. Patients asymptomatic for COVID-19 were screened by oronasal swab and chest imaging (chest X-ray or computed tomography if aged ≥ 18 years), proceeding to surgery if negative. COVID-19 positive patients at screening were delayed. Postoperatively, patients transitioning to COVID-19 positive status by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing were identified by an in-house tracking system and monitored for complications and death within 30 days of surgery. Out of 557 patients referred for surgery (230 (41.3%) women; median (IQR [range]) age 61 (48-72 [1-89])), 535 patients (96%) had COVID-19 screening, of which 13 were positive (2.4%, 95%CI 1.4-4.1%).

Out of these seven patients, four developed pneumonia, of which two required invasive ventilation including one patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Low rates of COVID-19 infection and mortality in the elective surgical population can be achieved within a targeted care bundle.

We modified the technical setup of a commercially available continuous veno-venous hemodialysis RCA module (multiFiltrate Ci-Ca®) to establish an RCA-protocol for TPE. METHODS Description of the modified technical setup and retrospective analysis of the feasibility of the RCA-protocol for TPE in all patients treated between 2009 and 2010. RESULTS 411 consecutive TPE with RCA were performed in 42 patients, all using FFP as replacement fluid. Median procedure characteristics were: blood flow 160 ml/min, filtrate flow 36 ml/min, duration 93 min, processed total plasma volume 3600 mL. Trisodium citrate was infused at a rate of 0.43 mmol/min to achieve post-filter ionized calcium levels of <0.4 mmol/l. Calcium substitution rate was 0.19 mmol/min to maintain physiologic iCa levels. RCA was well tolerated with no significant differences in pH, iCa, bicarbonate or potassium after repeated sessions. Clotting events complicated 7.3% of the procedures. Adverse events occurred in 3.4% of TPE procedures; none was severe or fatal. No significant differences were observed comparing the rate of adverse events to those observed in TPE using standard anticoagulation at our center (4.8%). CONCLUSIONS We describe for the first time a modified protocol for RCA in TPE using an integrated citrate module. Based on our experience, this RCA protocol is a feasible alternative for anticoagulation in TPE with FFP, especially in patients with a high risk of bleeding.","Betz, Christoph; Buettner, Stefan; Geiger, Helmut; Jung, Oliver",The International journal of artificial organs,407,19

METHODS Twenty-five patients who underwent primary tympanoplasty and/or canalplasty for middle ear malformation at a tertiary academic medical center were retrospectively reviewed. CEACS was defined as an EAC diameter of 4 mm or less. Intraoperative findings, including irregularity of the ossicles, facial nerve, or chorda tympani; size of the TM and EAC on computed tomography; and pre- and postoperative hearing level, were collected. RESULTS We included 7 and 18 patients with and without CEACS, respectively. The malleus handle defect, anterior deviation of the chorda tympani, and small TM (≤7 mm) (p-values 0.015, <0.001, and 0.003, respectively; Fisher's exact test) had significantly higher prevalence in patients with CEACS than in those without. The mean postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) in patients with CEACS was not significantly different from that in patients with normal-sized EAC (20.6 dB and 19.5 dB, respectively; p-value, 0.121; Mann-Whitney U test). No difference was observed in mean postoperative ABG between patients with small TM and those with normal-sized TM (19.2 dB and 20.0 dB, respectively; p-value, 0.469; Mann-Whitney U test). CONCLUSION Patients with CEACS were more likely to have malleus handle defect, anterior deviation of the chorda tympani, and small TM than those without CEACS. Hearing outcome of patients with CEACS and a malformed malleus and/or incus might be equivalent to that of patients without CEACS following tympanoplasty and/or canalplasty, regardless of the EAC or TM size.","Nakajima, Takahiro; Fukami, Satoru; Motegi, Masaomi; Kanaya, Hiroaki; Kojima, Hiromi; Haruna, Shinichi","Auris, nasus, larynx",407,19

The role of laparoscopy in the treatment of appendicitis remains controversial concerning the complication rate. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to compare open and laparoscopic appendectomy for SSI and IAA. METHODS All patients undergoing appendectomy between January 1, 2007 and May 31, 2010 were included in the study. Perioperative data and data on postoperative complications were collected from patient files. A questionnaire was used to assess complications after discharge. Main outcome parameters were SSI and IAA. Open appendectomy (OAG) and laparoscopic appendectomy (LAG) were compared with univariate and multivariate analyses for the outcome parameters. RESULTS Four hundred thirty patients were included in the study. SSI (all: 10.6%, OAG: 11.7%, LAG: 7.5%, P=0.293) and IAA (all: 2.8%, OAG: 2.4%, LAG: 3.8%, P=0.506) were not significantly different between OAG and LAG. Risk factors for SSI were age (P=0.003), body mass index (P=0.017), ASA score (P=0.001), the intraoperative grade of inflammation (P=0.004), and the histologic grade of inflammation (P=0.015).

However, progress into the clinic has been hampered by the relatively low magnitude of the immune response typically induced following administration in large target species, which is likely due to low transfection efficiency as well as insufficient recruitment of antigen-presenting cells to the injection site. Electroporation addresses both of these limitations by inducing transiently enhanced cell membrane permeability, thus facilitating uptake of the DNA into the host cell and creating a low level of inflammation conducive to enhanced influx of antigen-presenting cells to the injection site. Consequently, electroporation-mediated delivery of DNA vaccines results in very significant improvements in the transfection efficiency and immune responses in comparison to conventional injection. Importantly, electroporation is effective in virtually every animal model tested to date and has a favorable safety profile, which is promising for clinical application. In support of the potential for electroporation in human disease situations, early clinical results suggest that the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines is greatly improved when delivered with electroporation.","van Drunen Littel-van den Hurk, Sylvia; Hannaman, D",Expert review of vaccines,407,11

These results suggest that auditory verbal cues can improve the perceived flavor of beverages and swallow physiology.","Nakamura, Aya; Imaizumi, Satoshi",BioMed research international,407,27

INTRODUCTION Over the past three decades, nursing informatics competency research has evolved markedly within countries and nursing roles. It is important to examine the available literature on defining and assessing NI competencies to inform education, clinical practice, policy, and future research. INCLUSION CRITERIA We considered literature that defined or assessed the concept of nursing informatics competency as a combination of knowledge, skills, and attitudes. This included nursing informatics competencies of nurses and nursing students in a variety of health care or academic settings. METHODS An extensive search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus with Full Text via EBSCO, Ovid Embase, Ovid PsycINFO, ProQuest ERIC, Health and Psychosocial Instruments, ProQuest Australian Education Index, ProQuest Education Databases, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, OCLC PapersFirst, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, Wiley Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports. Initial search was conducted in May 2017 and updated several times. Nursing informatics websites were searched for gray literature including unpublished research and organizational documents. Additional papers were identified based on a search of reference lists of all the included papers. Neither language nor date restrictions were applied. Two reviewers assessed each of the included papers independently. Data extraction was undertaken using an extraction tool developed specifically for the scoping review objectives. RESULTS Fifty-two papers were included. Thirty-four papers identified nursing informatics competencies, grouped into four categories: i) nursing informatics competencies for students, entry-level nurses, or generalist nurses; ii) nursing informatics competencies for a specific nursing role; iii) recommendations for consensus on defining core nursing informatics competencies at the international level; and iv) forecasting future nursing informatics competencies as per evolving nursing roles. Eighteen papers reported on nursing informatics competency assessment tools. Results were discussed in a narrative format supported by tables. CONCLUSIONS This review provided insights to the state of the science on defining and assessing nursing informatics competencies for nurses and nursing students. Several nursing informatics competency lists are available, and despite some variations in domains of nursing informatics competency and indicator statements, they mostly share common themes. This literature demonstrates a heightened awareness of the importance of nursing informatics competency; however, the availability of many lists may be challenging for frontline nursing staff, nursing educators, administrators, researchers, and students to assimilate. Further research is needed to reach a consensus on core domains of nursing informatics competency and associated indicators, preferably per nursing roles, with international involvement and consensus. Additionally, while many nursing informatics competency assessment tools exist, further research is needed to examine psychometric properties of some of these tools.","Kleib, Manal; Chauvette, Amelia; Furlong, Karen; Nagle, Lynn; Slater, Linda; McCloskey, Rose",JBI evidence synthesis,407,24

Histopathological tumor regression with < 10% residual tumor is a globally accepted prognosticator in LAGC patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and curative surgery. However, despite a response of the primary tumor, a significant percentage of patients dies from recurrence and identification of those at risk for relapse remains challenging. We re-estimated the value of histopathological tumor regression as a prognosticator alongside other factors, especially posttherapy topographical nodal status, ypN-site. PATIENTS AND METHODS Individual patient data including clinicopathological variables were used from the four JCOG trials investigating NAC (JCOG0001, JCOG0002, JCOG0210, JCOG0405) for analyzing prognosticators in patients with curative surgery excluding those with type 4 AGC by univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses. RESULTS Among 85 patients, 5-year overall survival (OS) was 46.0% [95% confidence interval (CI) 35.0-56.4] with a median follow-up of 3.2 years. On univariable analysis, histopathological tumor regression with ≥ 10% residual tumor and ypN-site 2-3 were negatively associated with OS [≥ 10% residual tumor: hazard ratio (HR) 2.60; 95% CI 1.22-5.54; P = 0.014; ypN2-3: HR 3.59; 95% CI 1.60-8.06; P = 0.002). On multivariable analysis, only ypN-site 2-3 was predictive of OS (HR 3.67; 95% CI 1.55-8.69; P = 0.003), whereas histopathological tumor regression with ≥ 10% residual tumor was not (HR 2.24; 95% CI 0.98-5.10; P = 0.055). CONCLUSIONS ypN-site may have greater impact on OS than histopathological tumor regression in patients who received NAC plus surgery for non-type 4 LAGC.","Fujitani, Kazumasa; Nakamura, Kenichi; Mizusawa, Jyunki; Kuwata, Takeshi; Shimoda, Tadakazu; Katayama, Hiroshi; Kushima, Ryoji; Taniguchi, Hirokazu; Yoshikawa, Takaki; Boku, Narikazu; Terashima, Masanori; Fukuda, Haruhiko; Sano, Takeshi; Sasako, Mitsuru",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,407,19

Researcher use metabolomics to examine the underlying mechanisms of clinically observed phenotypes. However, these methods are complex, potentially impeding their uptake by scientists. In this scoping review, we summarize literature illustrating nurse scientists' use of metabolomics. Using electronic search methods, we identified metabolomics investigations conducted by nurse scientists and published in English-language journals between 1990 and November 2019. Of the studies included in the review (N = 30), 9 (30%) listed first and/or senior authors that were nurses. Studies were conducted predominantly in the United States and focused on a wide array of clinical conditions across the life span. The upward trend we note in the use of these methods by nurse scientists over the past 2 decades mirrors a similar trend across scientists of all backgrounds. A broad range of study designs were represented in the literature we reviewed, with the majority involving untargeted metabolomics (n = 16, 53.3%) used to generate hypotheses (n = 13, 76.7%) of potential metabolites and/or metabolic pathways as mechanisms of clinical conditions. Metabolomics methods match well with the unique perspective of nurse researchers, who seek to integrate the experiences of individuals to develop a scientific basis for clinical practice that emphasizes personalized approaches. Although small in number, metabolomics investigations by nurse scientists can serve as the foundation for robust programs of research to answer essential questions for nursing.","Kimble, Laura P; Leslie, Sharon; Carlson, Nicole",Biological research for nursing,407,1

This review examines the new electronic sensors for adherence monitoring and studies that used telemedicine in the school setting to improve asthma outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS School-based telemedicine provides an important service to families of school-aged children who have difficulty due to time and distance in planning and keeping in-person appointments with primary or specialty providers. Significant improvements in objective measures of asthma control are inconsistently observed although caregiver and parent quality of life and child self-management behaviors are improved and satisfaction is high. Assessment and outcomes related to adherence are mentioned in studies but results are not often reported. However, it appears that adherence interventions are beneficial while maintained but the effects are not sustained upon intervention discontinuation. SUMMARY The school setting provides a convenient and suitable environment to conduct telemedicine visits between school-aged children and their primary care or specialty provider. Electronic adherence sensors allow review of controller and rescue medication use through a cloud-based dashboard and provides an opportunity for real-time assessment and intervention by providers to improve asthma outcomes.","Blake, Kathryn V",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,407,19

In tMCAO model, intraluminal suture technique is widely used to achieve ischemia and reperfusion. However, variation of infarct volume in this model often requires large sample size, which hinders the progress of preclinical research. Our previous study demonstrated that infarct volume was related to the success of reperfusion although the reason remained unclear. The aim of present study is to explore the relationship between focal thrombus formation and model reproducibility with respect to infarct volume. We hypothesize that suture-induced thrombosis causes infarct volume variability due to insufficient reperfusion after suture withdrawal. Seventy-two adult male CD-1 mice underwent 90 minutes of tMCAO with or without intraperitoneal administration of heparin. Dynamic synchrotron radiation microangiography (SRA) and laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) were performed before and after tMCAO to observe the cerebral vascular morphology and to measure the cerebral blood flow in vivo. Infarct volume and neurological score were examined to evaluate severity of ischemic brain injury. We found that the rate of successful reperfusion was much higher in heparin-treated mice compared to that in heparin-free mice according to the result of SRA and LSCI at 1 and 3 hours after suture withdrawal (p<0.05). Pathological features and SRA revealed that thrombus formed in the internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery or anterior cerebral artery, which blocked reperfusion following tMCAO. LSCI showed that cortical collateral circulation could be disturbed by thrombi. Our results demonstrated that suture-induced thrombosis was a critical element, which affects the success of reperfusion. Appropriate heparin management provides a useful approach for improving reproducibility of reperfusion model in mice.","Lin, Xiaojie; Miao, Peng; Wang, Jixian; Yuan, Falei; Guan, Yongjing; Tang, Yaohui; He, Xiaosong; Wang, Yongting; Yang, Guo-Yuan",PloS one,407,5

The continuous upgrading of information technology has also enabled smartphones to display great potential in the field of health care. OBJECTIVE We aimed to determine the future research direction of mobile health (mHealth) by analyzing its research trends and latest research hotspots. METHODS This study collected mHealth-related literature published between 2000 and 2020 from the Web of Science database. Descriptive statistics of publication trends of mHealth research were determined by analyzing the annual number of publications in the literature and annual number of publications by country. We constructed visualization network maps of country (or regional) collaborations and author-provided keyword co-occurrences, as well as overlay visualization maps of the average publication year of author-provided keywords to analyze the hotspots and research trends in mHealth research. RESULTS In total, 12,593 mHealth-related research papers published between 2000 and 2020 were found. The results showed an exponential growth trend in the number of annual publications in mHealth literature. JMIR mHealth and uHealth, the Journal of Medical Internet Research, and JMIR Research Protocols were the 3 top journals with respect to number of publications. The United States remained the leading contributor to the literature in this area (5294/12,593, 42.0%), well ahead of other countries and regions. Other countries and regions also showed a clear trend of annual increases in the number of mHealth publications. The 4 countries with the largest number of publications-the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia-were found to cooperate more closely. The rest of the countries and regions showed a clear geographic pattern of cooperation. The keyword co-occurrence analysis of the top 100 authors demonstrated 5 clusters, namely, development of mHealth medical technology and its application to various diseases, use of mHealth technology to improve basic public health and health policy, mHealth self-health testing and management in daily life, adolescent use of mHealth, and mHealth in mental health. The research trends revealed a gradual shift in mHealth research from health policy and improving public health care to the development and social application of mHealth technologies. CONCLUSIONS To the best of our knowledge, the most current bibliometric analysis dates back to 2016. However, the number of mHealth research published between 2017 and 2020 exceeds the previous total. The results of this study shed light on the latest hotspots and trends in mHealth research. These findings provide a useful overview of the development of the field; they may also serve as a valuable reference and provide guidance for researchers in the digital health field.","Cao, Jianfei; Lim, Yeongjoo; Sengoku, Shintaro; Guo, Xitong; Kodama, Kota",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,407,24

Previously, the hypothesis was that tumors developed due to dedifferentiation of mature cells. We studied the regulation of gastric acid secretion and showed that gastrin through the gastrin receptor stimulates enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell histamine release and proliferation. In animal and human studies, we and others showed that long-term hypergastrinemia results in ECL cell-derived tumor through a sequence of hyperplasia, dysplasia, neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), and possibly neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and adenocarcinomas of diffuse type. Perhaps, other cancers may also have their origin in differentiated cells. Knowledge of the growth regulation of the cell of origin is important in cancer prophylaxis and treatment. Physiology plays a central role in carcinogenesis through hormones and other growth factors. Every cell division implies a small risk of mutation; thus mitogens are also mutagens.

The purpose of this review article was to review the existing literature about the roles of faculty members as advisors, mentors, and gatekeepers who provide social support for undergraduate students. Social support is a buffer for stress, and current undergraduate students are more stressed than their predecessors. Method: The study is a narrative review of the literature about faculty as advisors, mentors, and gatekeepers. The concept of social support and its relationship to students' stress is explored, followed by a discussion of faculty advisors' roles, knowledge, and skills and a synthesis of literature about prescriptive, developmental, praxis, and appreciative advising. A discussion of faculty as mentors who focus on students' experiences before, during, and after college and as gatekeepers who look for signs of students in distress concludes the review. Conclusions: Faculty may provide social support to students inside and outside the classroom as advisors, mentors, and gatekeepers. Assuming these roles means faculty must consider students as whole people who have needs and experiences beyond academics. Students' stress was clear in the literature before COVID-19, and their concerns and needs are exacerbated during the pandemic. Additional research is needed to identify effective advising and mentoring programs for communication sciences and disorders undergraduate students. Increased institutional support for and recognition of the time, resources, and training faculty need to serve in this expanded role is also critical as faculty members attempt to manage their own stress.","Roos, Brianne H.; Schreck, Janet S.",Perspectives of the ASHA Special Interest Groups,407,16

Our study aims to understand the attitude and behaviour of common people towards visiting the hospital during COVID-19 pandemic in two major hotspot states of India namely Maharashtra and Karnataka. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted between July-august 2021 among the population of two states. A total of 636 respondents completed the survey and returned electronically. Data were analysed using suitable statistical tools to achieve the objective of the study. Results: 74.8% of the respondents were not ready to visit the hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic unless the symptoms were serious. On the other hand, 25.2% of the of respondents were willing to go to the hospitals. The top three reasons for the reduction in visits are fear of getting infected in the hospitals by COVID-19 patients (72.6%), fear of stepping out of home (31.1%) and fear of COVID-19 infection by the lab equipment (24.5%). Conclusion: Overall the study revealed that there was a reduction in number of visits to the hospitals for common diseases in people after the pandemic started. But the people were still willing to go to the hospitals if they noticed any major symptoms or symptoms related to COVID-19. Our findings may be useful to develop strategies to address concerns in order to ensure that people do not get any serious illness because of the fear of COVID-19.","Shamsundar, M.",,407,26

We developed a new 3D-printed sampling cage and assessed four commercially-available materials (cotton gauze, cotton cheesecloth, cellulose sponges, and electronegative filters) for RNA adsorption in the cage. We determined that cheesecloth and electronegative filters provided an effective approach for collecting and measuring SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. We also compared the performance of three elution mixtures (a commercially-available lysis buffer, a Tween (R) 20-based buffer, and a 1:1 acetonitrile:water mixture) for detection of heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 reference material (HI-SCV-2) spiked into municipal wastewater at 1.0 x 10(3) genomic units per millilitre (GU mL(-1)). The highest mean RNA concentrations were achieved using the cheesecloth (7.0 x 10(4) +/- 3.7 x 10(4) GU per eluate) and electronegative filters (2.3 x 10(4) +/- 2.5 x 10(4) GU per eluate) in combination with the Tween (R) 20-based buffer with positive detections in all three biological replicates for both material types. We deployed passive samplers at two sewer catchments (locations A and B) to compare the performance of each passive sampler material type in the field.

Despite the global concern, developing countries have been suffering disproportionately due to the dominance of informal workers in their labour market, posing the necessity to campaign for the immediate protection of this vulnerable population. This paper analyses various dimensions of the vulnerability of urban floating workers in the context of Covid-19 in Bangladesh. In reference to International Labour Organization's (ILO) ""Decent Work"" concept, this paper endeavours to examine floating workers' vulnerability using the insider-outsider framework in context to Covid-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach The study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, data were collected before the pandemic to assess the vulnerability of the informal floating workers. Later, we extended the study to the second phase during the Covid-19 pandemic to understand how pandemic affects the lives and livelihood of floating workers. In phase one, data were collected from a sample of 342 floating workers and analysed based on job security, wages, working environment, psychological wellbeing and education to understand the vulnerability of floating workers. In phase two, 20 in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted, followed by thematic analysis to explore how the pandemic affects the existing vulnerability of floating workers. Findings Various social protection schemes were analysed to evaluate their effectiveness in reducing the vulnerability of floating workers facing socio-economic crises. The study has found that the pandemic has multiplied the existing vulnerability of the floating workers on many fronts that include job losses, food crisis, shelter insecurity, education, social, physical and mental wellbeing. In response to the pandemic, the Government stimulus packages and Non-government Covid-19 initiatives lack the appropriate system, magnitude, and focus on protecting the floating workers in Bangladesh. Practical implications This paper outlines various short-term interventions and long-term policy prescriptions to safeguard floating workers' lives and livelihood from the ongoing Corona pandemic and unforeseen uncertainties. Originality/value This paper is the first of its kind that aims at understanding the vulnerability of this significant workforce in Bangladesh, taking the whole picture of Government and Non-government initiatives during Covid-19.","Alam, S.; Adnan, Z.

Methods: 63 pwCF enrolled for the classes via Beam. In addition, questionnaires were completed prior to and during shielding to establish motivation and personal objectives with exercise allowing therapists to structure sessions. 28 exercise and 12 education sessions focussing on the health and well-being of the pwCF were delivered. Exercises were adapted to all abilities through a variety of activities eg. yoga, strength and conditioning (S&C), easy exercise and high intensity interval training (HIIT). Results: 26 pwCF attended for 1 or more exercise sessions and 37 attended education sessions. Due to CF cross-infection limitations existing prior to COVID-19, group sessions were previously prohibited. These virtual classes allowed us to be 5× more time efficient with exercise and 12× more efficient when delivering education in a group setting than if they were delivered face-to-face. The post pilot questionnaire showed 64% were exercising on BEAM with their CF physio. The greatest uptake was HIIT (82%) followed by S&C (45%) with other options being equivocal. Motivation (measured using a VAS) increased from 5.75 (SD 2.67) pre-pilot to 7.18 (SD 2.36) post p = 0.189. Levels of perceived fitness also increased from 4.12 to 5.9 post-pilot p = 0.62.

The European Union established a dedicated regulation to limit the impacts of invasive alien species (IAS), which is focused on a Union List of IAS of particular concern. However, no previous study has specifically addressed the ecology of invasive alien mammals included in the Union List. We performed a systematic review of published literature on these species. We retrieved 262 studies dealing with 16 species, and we complemented these with the most up-to-date information extracted from global databases on IAS. We show that most of the study species reached Europe as pets that escaped from captivity or were intentionally released. On average, 1.2 species’ new first records/year were documented in European countries in the period 1981-2020, and most species are still expanding their alien ranges colonising neighbouring territories. France, Germany, Italy, and The Netherlands are the most invaded nations, and the muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), and the American mink (Neovison vison) are the most widespread species, having invaded at least 27 countries each. Invasive mammals of European Union concern are threatening native biodiversity and human well-being: worryingly, 81.3% of the study species are implicated in the epidemiological cycle of zoonotic pathogens. Containing the secondary spread to further countries is of paramount importance to avoid the establishment of new populations of invasive mammals and the related impacts on native communities, ecosystem services, and human health. Our results offer the most updated compendium on the ecology of invasive mammals of European Union concern, that can be used to assist environmental policies, identify and subsequently fill knowledge gaps, and inform stakeholders.

This coincided with a well-documented alteration to the frequency and characteristics of maxillofacial trauma presentations. The aim was to examine the incidence and characteristics of maxillofacial trauma at a large tertiary hospital in the United Kingdom to determine whether these previously reported changes persisted after the relaxation of COVID-19 ?lockdown? legislation. Method: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who sustained a facial injury during the 8-week period of 16th March 2020 to 11th May 2020 (strict COVID lockdown) compared to the 11th May 2020 to 6th July 2020 (relaxation of COVID lockdown). Cohorts were compared on the incidence and characteristics of facial injury. Results: Compared to the peak of COVID-19 lockdown, the subsequent period during which these laws were eased saw an increase in the frequency of maxillofacial trauma presentations (n?=?78 vs n?=?37). Despite this absolute increase, the incidence remained statistically below seasonal expectation. Operative management remained persistently low (45% in 2020 vs 67% in 2019). Conclusion: This is the first study to report the characteristics of facial trauma after the easing of COVID-19 lockdown legislation. Compared to previously published reports from Australia, there has not yet been a clear return to baseline epidemiology in the UK, perhaps reflecting the severity of the pandemic in that region.","McEwen, Ellie C.; Hoffman, Gary R.; Qiu, Michael M.; Pandya, Rishi Walton Gary M.",FACE,407,1

Highly infectious types of biomedical wastes are commonly generated at an unacceptably high rate from health laboratories of developing countries with a poor management system like Ethiopia. This study was aimed to evaluate the generation rate of biomedical wastes, management practices, and associated factors among public healthcare medical laboratories in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Materials and methods: A Health institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from July 13 to September 25, 2020, in 6 hospital laboratories and 20 health center laboratories in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, and practice of biomedical waste management of the health facilities, Biomedical waste generation rate were collected using data collection tools. Data were managed using SPSS version 20 software. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, linear and logistic regression analysis were computed to identify independent predictors of the dependent variable. An Odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was used to determine the strength of association. Results: The finding revealed that the mean plus or minus SD of the daily generation rate of biomedical wastes was 4.9 plus or minus 3.13 kg/day per medical laboratory. Nineteen (74.3%) medical laboratories had a proper practice of biomedical waste management which is significantly associated with knowledge of professionals on biomedical waste management policies and guidelines, availability of separate financial sources for biomedical waste management, and training level of professionals. Conclusion: The study showed a high generation of biomedical waste from medical laboratories in public healthcare in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Near two-thirds of health facilities had a proper practice of waste segregation, collection, storage, and treatment of biomedical wastes generated from their laboratory. However, there was a poor practice of transportation and disposal.

Elevated T should increase ventilation-induced lung injury. Exogenous surfactant therapy, intended to lower T, has not reduced mortality. Sulforhodamine B (SRB) might, alternatively, be employed to lower T. We test whether substances suspected of elevating T in ARDS raise T in the lungs and test the abilities of exogenous surfactant and SRB to reduce T. In isolated rat lungs, we micropuncture a surface alveolus and instill a solution of a purported T-raising substance: control saline, cell debris, secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2), acid or mucins. We test each substance alone; with albumin, to model proteinaceous edema liquid; with albumin and exogenous surfactant; or with albumin and SRB. We determine T in situ in the lungs by combining servo-nulling pressure measurement with confocal microscopy, and applying the Laplace relation. With control saline, albumin does not alter T, additional surfactant raises T and additional SRB lowers T. The experimental substances, without or with albumin, raise T. Excepting under aspiration conditions, addition of surfactant or SRB lowers T. Exogenous surfactant activity is concentration and ventilation dependent. Sulforhodamine B, which could be delivered intravascularly, holds promise as an alternative therapeutic. New and Noteworthy In the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lowering surface tension, T, should reduce ventilation injury yet exogenous surfactant has not reduced mortality. We show with direct T-determination in isolated lungs that substances suggested to elevate T in ARDS indeed raise T, and exogenous surfactant reduces T. Further, we extend our previous finding that sulforhodamine B (SRB) reduces T below normal in healthy lungs and show that SRB, too, reduces T under ARDS conditions.","Nguyen, Tam L.; Perlman, Carrie E.",bioRxiv,407,24

New perspectives and further thoughts on aspects of infant observation;beginnings and endings, observing during a pandemic and the search for a baby to observe",16.114288,4.23488,2021,"Purpose: The aim of this paper is to examine dynamic linkages between price and rent and between property types. Intuition suggests that housing market segments experience different market cycles in response to macroeconomic shocks. However, they may be dynamically interlinked in urban areas because of substitutability. The linkage may even change, if preference weakens for multiple occupancies. A sudden reduction in apartment demand may create repercussions to other housing segments. Past analyses, despite their contributions, are static and do not consider possible linkages between property types. To fill this void, this paper investigates the price-rent dynamics for urban homes by adopting the case of Singapore. Design/methodology/approach: This paper applies a methodology from Phillips et al. (2015) to Singaporean housing (price and rent) data. Phillips et al. (2015) recently proposed a test for an explosive root in time series data and has spurred several empirical applications in the bubble literature. Findings: This paper finds for Singapore that the markets were subjected to explosive growth (where rents grew at a higher rate than prices did) during the Global Financial Crisis. Also, the results suggest that rent drives price and that non-landed housing (offices in central areas) leads to other residential housing (non-residential housing) in both price and rent. Practical implications: Overall, the present findings suggest that rent drives price, while property types are interlinked. Non-landed homes and offices in central areas are the sources of repercussions. Under normal circumstances, rental shocks may be propagated positively from nonlanded housing (central offices) to the other residential (non-residential) property types as the present findings suggest, which enables us to infer that a decrease in non-landed housing (central offices) rent may lead to an increase in rent on other property types because pandemic shocks only shift demand fromone property type to another, unlike typical macroeconomic shocks. Originality/value: Urban homes are faced with uncertainty arising from the COVID-19 outbreak for which city residents have a stronger incentive to exile to suburbs. Urban life may no longer be attractive because of social distancing and work from home policy. This has implications for urban home demands that are closely linked to urban house price and rent. In the present study, the paper set out to investigate the price-rent and property-type dynamics for urban homes in Singapore. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ji, P.

IMI reduced acetylcholine esterase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Glutathione (GSH) content decreased with increasing concentration of IMI;however, GSH was not affected and accompanied by an increase in catalase activity with the highest concentration of IMI. Lipid peroxidation increased steadily as IMI concentration increased. Based on the ultrastructural analyses of the follicle cells and the ooplasm of developing oocytes, acute IMI toxicity produced damaged yolk bodies, pale nuclei, and shrinking microvilli. Fractionation of rough endoplasmic reticulum, deformed mitochondria, and autophagic bodies were also observed. In conclusion, these ovarian pathobiochemical changes could be used as biomarkers of acute IMI exposure.","Abdelsalam, S. A.; Alzahrani, A. M.; Elmenshawy, O. M.; Azza, Sedky Abdel-Moneim A.

There is an upsurge of uneasiness among people who plan to return to their daily activities in person, as the world recovers from the pandemic and plans to get back to a state of regularity. Wearing a face mask significantly reduces the risk of viral transmission and provides a sense of protection, according to several studies. However, manually tracking the implementation of this policy is not possible. The key here is technology. We present a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based architecture for detecting instances of improper use of face masks. Our system uses two-stage CNN architecture that can detect both masked and unmasked faces and is compatible with CCTV cameras. This will aid in the tracking of safety violations, the promotion of face mask use, and the creation of a safe working environment.","Chavda, A.; Dsouza, J.; Badgujar, S.; Damani, A.; Ieee,",2021 6th International Conference for Convergence in Technology,407,1

In this frame, the presented study follows a previous analysis of the temporal link between cases and deaths during the first epidemic wave (Phase 1) in Italy (March-June 2020). We here analyze the COVID-19 epidemic in the time span from March 2020 to June 2021. The elaboration of the curves of cases and deaths allows identifying the temporal shift between the positive testing and the fatal event, which corresponds to one week from W2 to W33, two weeks from W34 to W41, and three weeks from W42 to W67. Based on this finding, we calculate the Weekly Lethality Rate (WLR). The WLR was grossly overestimated (~13.5%) in Phase 1, while a mean value of 2.6% was observed in most of Phase 2 (starting from October 2020), with a drop to 1.4% in the last investigated weeks. Overall, these findings offer an interesting insight into the magnitude and time evolution of the lethality burden attributable to COVID-19 during the entire pandemic period in Italy. In particular, the analysis highlighted the impact of the effectiveness of public health and social measures, of changes in disease management, and of preventive strategies over time.","d'Alessandro, V.; Balasco, N.; Ferrara, P.; Vitagliano, L.",,407,1

Data sources: Secondary data of patients that visited emergency department of Vlora Regional hospital Albania (largest hospital in the south of the country), since January 1, 2017 till December 31, 2020. Study Design: This is a retrospective study. We used the hard copy of the patients health register records. Extraction methods: The data extraction was conducted during March 2021 till June 2021. Eligible were all patients admitted and recorded in the registry of the Emergency department. The causes of admission were categorized in 14 different disease categories. All registered patient admitted to the Vlora regional hospital were included in the study. Patients that all data were not recorded and patients that data were not possible to be read were excluded. Principal Findings: Study population included 44.917 patients during 2017-2020. Mean age of patients was 51.5 years, while 53.6% were females. The highest number of patients was in 2017 (n=12.407) and the lowest in 2020 (n=9.266). Increase of patients presented with cardiovascular, psychiatric and renal/urinary tract were observed in 2020 in comparison to 2019. Patients decreased over time with an average annual percent decrease of -7% (p-value=0.22). Joinpoint analysis revealed that mortality rate increased over time with an average annual percent increase of 34.3% (95% confidence interval= -42.7% to 214.8%, p-value=0.27). Conclusions: During the study years the number of patients visiting emergency department decreased while mortality rate increased. Educating and raising awareness of patient to seek medical assistance should be a key objective of health policy makers and health personnel. A specific focus should be put on the more vulnerable (elderly and unemployed) as their health status is in higher risk.","Bucaj, J.; Mechili, E.

Here we explore a diversity outbred approach for dissecting complex traits in Peromyscus leucopus, a non-traditional genetic model system. We take advantage of a closed colony of deer-mice founded from 38 individuals between 1982 and 1985 and subsequently maintained for 35+ years (∼40-60 generations). From 405 low-pass (∼1X) short-read sequenced deermice we accurately imputed genotypes at 17,751,882 SNPs. Conditional on observed genotypes for a subset of 297 individuals, simulations were conducted in which a QTL contributes 5% to a complex trait under three different genetic models. The power of either a haplotype- or marker-based statistical test was estimated to be 15-25% to detect the hidden QTL. Although modest, this power estimate is consistent with that of DO/HS mice and rat experiments for an experiment with ∼300 individuals. This limitation in QTL detection is mostly associated with the stringent significance threshold required to hold the genome-wide false positive rate low, as in all cases we observe considerable linkage signal at the location of simulated QTL, suggesting a larger panel would exhibit greater power. For the subset of cases where a QTL was detected, localization ability appeared very desirable at ∼1-2Mb. We finally carried out a GWAS on a demonstration trait, bleeding time. No tests exceeded the threshold for genome-wide significance, but one of four suggestive regions co-localizes with Von Willebrand factor. Our work suggests that complex traits can be dissected in founders-unknown P. leucopus colony mice in much the same manner as founders-known DO/HS mice and rats, with genotypes obtained from low pass sequencing data. Our results further suggest that the DO/HS approach can be powerfully extended to any system in which a founders-unknown closed colony has been maintained for several dozen generations.","Long, Phillip N; Cook, Vanessa J; Majumder, Arundhati; Barbour, Alan G; Long, Anthony D",bioRxiv,407,16

These policies, since they have a high impact on people’s health, need feedback on people’s emotional perception and their connections with entities directly related to emotions, to have relevant information for decision making. Given the global social isolation, emotions have been expressed with higher magnitude in comments on social networks, generating a large amount of data that is a source for various investigations. The objective of this work is to design and adapt an interactive visualization tool called CovidStream, for monitoring the evolution of emotions associated with Covid-19 in Peru, for which Visual Analytics, Deep learning, and Sentiment Analysis techniques are combined. This visualization tool allows showing the evolution of the emotions associated with the Covid-19 and its relationships with three entities: persons, places, and organizations, which have an impact on emotions, all in a temporal space dimension. For the visualization of entities and emotions, Peruvian tweets extracted between January and July 2020 were used, all of them with the hashtag #Covid-19.

ED’ psychiatric population is considered fragile, at risk of under triage.ObjectivesWe evaluated all the population who went to the ED for mental disorder to assess the severity of cases evaluated as exit code and rate of hospitalization.MethodsWe evaluated all patients accessing our ED for mental disorder from February 22 to May 1, 2020 and during the same period of the previous year.ResultsWe enrolled 345 patients. There was a severe reduction in the total number of accesses for mental disorder: 142 in the CoViD period and 203 in 2019. The vital parameters, age (mean about 40 years) and sex were overlapping without statistically significant differences. The priority codes for the medical examination were not different. CoViD pandemic patients have higher discharge severity codes (yellow and red) more frequently than in the reference period (9.9% vs 5.9%) and more frequently need hospitalization (25.3% vs 18.6%).ConclusionsThe epidemic has led to a reduction of accesses for mental disorder. Patients had more frequent hospitalization needs and more severe exit codes. the data may be due to the fact that during the pandemic only the most serious patients access the E.D., but also to the fact that a pandemic has contributed to destabilizing this class of fragile patients.","Savioli, G.; Pesenti, S.; Ceresa, I.; Oddone, E.; Bressan, M.

In England, the three main models documented over the past fifty years (teams offering crisis assessment and treatment at home; acute day services; and residential crisis services in the community) have recently been augmented by several new service models. These are intended to enhance choice and flexibility within catchment area acute care systems, but remain largely undocumented in the research literature. We therefore aimed to describe the types and distribution of crisis care models across England through a national survey. Methods: We carried out comprehensive mapping of crisis resolution teams (CRTs) using previous surveys, websites and multiple official data sources. Managers of CRTs were invited to participate as key informants who were familiar with the provision and organisation of crisis care services within their catchment area. The survey could be completed online or via telephone interview with a researcher, and elicited details about types of crisis care delivered in the local catchment area. Results: We mapped a total of 200 adult CRTs and completed the survey with 184 (92%). Of the 200 mapped adult CRTs, there was a local (i.e., within the adult CRT catchment area) children and young persons CRT for 84 (42%), and an older adults CRT for 73 (37%). While all but one health region in England provided CRTs for working age adults, there was high variability regarding provision of all other community crisis service models and system configurations. Crisis cafes, street triage teams and separate crisis assessment services have all proliferated since a similar survey in 2016, while provision of acute day units has reduced. Conclusions: The composition of catchment area crisis systems varies greatly across England and popularity of models seems unrelated to strength of evidence. A group of emerging crisis care models with varying functions within service systems are increasingly prevalent: they have potential to offer greater choice and flexibility in managing crises, but an evidence base regarding impact on service user experiences and outcomes is yet to be established.","Dalton-Locke, C.; Johnson, S.; Harju-Seppanen, J.; Lyons, N.; Sheridan Rains, L.; Stuart, R.; Campbell, A.; Clark, J.; Clifford, A.; Courtney, L.; Dare, C.; Kathleen, K.; Lynch, C.; McCrone, P.; Nairi, S.; Newbigging, K.; Nyikavaranda, P.; Osborn, D.; Persaud, K.; Stefan, M.; Lloyd-Evans, B.",,407,25

Although some tools exist for transgene misexpression in developing chick embryos, we have refined and advanced them by simplifying and optimizing constructs for spatiotemporal control. To maintain expression over the entire course of embryonic development we use an enhanced piggyBac transposon system that efficiently integrates sequences into the host genome. We also incorporate a DNA targeting sequence to direct plasmid translocation into the nucleus and a D4Z4 insulator sequence to prevent epigenetic silencing. We designed these constructs to minimize their size and maximize cellular uptake, and to simplify usage by placing all of the integrating sequences on a single plasmid. Following electroporation of stage HH8.5 embryos, our tetracycline-inducible promoter construct produces robust transgene expression in the presence of doxycycline at any point during embryonic development in ovo or in culture. Moreover, expression levels can be modulated by titrating doxycycline concentrations and spatial control can be achieved using beads or gels.

To provide a pre-COVID-19 baseline, we have examined antidepressant prescribing trends for 5 years preceding COVID-19. Methods: A retrospective analysis of anonymised data on medicines prescribed by GPs in England from the Open-Prescribing Database (January 2015 to December 2019) identified the 10 most prescribed antidepressant and, for comparison, cardiovascular medicines. Results: Prescription items for the 10 most prescribed antidepressants rose 25% from 58 million (2015) to 72 million (2019). Citalopram was the most prescribed antidepressant;prescriptions for sertraline rose fastest at 2 million items year on year. Over the same period, costs for antidepressant prescribing fell 27.8%. Across all Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in England, antidepressant prescribing levels, adjusted for population were positively correlated with the index of multiple deprivation (IMD) score. In comparison, prescribing for the top 10 most prescribed cardiovascular medicines increased by 2.75% from 207 million (2015) to 213 million (2019) items. Limitations: Anonymised data in the Open-Prescribing Database means no patient diagnoses or treatment plans are linked to this data. Conclusion: Antidepressant prescribing, particularly sertraline, is increasing. Prescribing is higher in more deprived regions, but costs are falling to <2% of all items prescribed. Absolute numbers of prescriptions for cardiovascular medicines are higher, likely reflecting the greater prevalence of cardiovascular disease, and are rising more slowly. This study will enable future work to look at the impact of COVID-19 on prescribing for mental health.","Lalji, Hasnain Mussadiq McGrogan Anita Bailey Sarah J.",Journal of Affective Disorders Reports,407,1

There is a need to develop a screening paradigm that maintains this high sensitivity, while ensuring non-cardiotoxic compounds pass this phase of the drug approval process. In this study, we develop an in vitro-in silico pipeline using human induced stem-cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) to address this problem. The pipeline includes a model-guided optimization that produces a voltage-clamp (VC) protocol to determine drug block of seven cardiac ion channels. Such VC data, along with action potential (AP) recordings, were acquired from iPSC-CMs before and after treatment with a control solution or a low-, intermediate-, or high-risk drug. We identified significant AP prolongation (a proarrhythmia indicator) in two high-risk drugs and, from the VC data, determined strong ion channel blocks that led to the AP changes. The VC data also uncovered an undocumented funny current (If) block by quinine, which we confirmed with experiments using a HEK-293 expression line. We present a new approach to cardiotoxicity screening that simultaneously evaluates proarrhythmia risk (e.g. AP prolongation) and mechanism (e.g. channel block) from iPSC-CMs.","Clark, Alexander P.; Wei, Siyu; Krogh-Madsen, Trine; Christini, David J.",bioRxiv,407,29

Method: We retrospectively studied confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted with a neurological condition from 1st May 2020 to 30th January 2021. Neurological diagnoses and their temporal relationship to respiratory features along with clinicodemographic profile for such patients was ascertained. Result: 228 patients were diagnosed with NeuroCOVID at our centre. Of the 162 included population (median age was 59 (50–70) and 62.3% (1 0 1) were male) and 73.5% were diagnosed with NeuroCovid before any respiratory or febrile features. 46 patients (28.8%) had a pre/co-existing neurological illness, and 103 (63.6%) had systemic comorbidities. No significant difference was observed when comparing demographics and comorbidities of NeuroCOVID patients presenting with and without fever and respiratory features. Moreover, no individual NeuroCOVID diagnosis was more prone to present with respiratory or febrile features. Diabetes mellitus was the only comorbidity which was significantly higher in the ischemic stroke group, all other comorbidities and characteristics were evenly distributed between stroke and non-stroke NeuroCOVID patients and encephalopathy non encephalopathy NeuroCOVID patients. Conclusion: Stroke and encephalopathy are the most prevalent parainfectious neurological conditions occurring with COVID-19 in the Indian population. This study demonstrates seemingly low-risk individuals (i.e. people without pre-existing systemic and neurological comorbidities) may develop neurological conditions. Moreover, NeuroCOVID may manifest independent of respiratory features and fever. © 2021","Bhansali, S.; Bagrodia, V.; Choudhury, S.; Rahman, S.; Golder, M.; Tiwari, M.; Kumar, H.",Journal of Clinical Neuroscience,407,14

We have demonstrated the efficacy of FDA-approved axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta) in a multiethnic New York City underserved population with 80% complete response (CR) rate in the first ten patients treated at our institution (Abbasi et al., 2020). There is limited data on the propensity of infections and lymphohematopoietic reconstitution after Day 30 (D30) following CAR-T cell therapy. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence and nature of infectious complications in an expanded cohort of DLBCL patients treated with CD19 CAR-T therapy and its association with the dynamics of leukocyte subpopulation reconstitution post-CAR-T cell therapy. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of patients who received CAR-T therapy at our institution between 2018-2020. Variables collected include patient demographics, absolute neutrophil (ANC), lymphocyte (ALC) and monocyte counts (AMC) at Day 30, hematologic reconstitution (ANC≥ 1500/µL) at Day 90 (D90), presence or absence of infections after D30 by clinical and/or microbiological parameters. Associations between presence of infection and D30 ANC, ALC, AMC, ANC/ALC ratio, AMC/ALC ratio were assessed using Kruskal-Wallis test. Association between infection and hematologic reconstitution at D90 was done using Chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank test were used to evaluate overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results: Nineteen patients were evaluated in our study, consisting of 42% (8) Hispanic, 32% (6) Caucasian, 21% (4) African-American, and 5% (1) Asian subjects. Based on clinical and microbiologic data, 47% (9) developed an infection after D30 (infection group) while 53% (10) of subjects remained infection-free after D30 (non-infection group). The most common infection type observed was viral (11 patients) followed by bacterial (8 patients) and fungal (3 patients) (Table 1). Of 25 total infectious events, 44% (11) were grade 1 or 2 and 48% (12) were grade 3 with 10 being viral in etiology. Two deaths occurred due to an infectious process. Three patients tested SARS-CoV-2 positive and were hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. Median OS and PFS has not been reached in either group. To determine the kinetics of lymphohematopoietic reconstitution and its association with infection risk, we evaluated the relationship between cytopenias and rates of infection after D30. Notably, compared to non-infection group, infection group had a higher median ALC (1000/µL vs 600/µL p=0.04), a lower median ANC/ALC ratio (1.4 vs 4.5 p<0.01) and a lower median AMC/ALC at D30 (0.36 vs 1.33, p=0.01) (Table 2). In addition, patients in the infection group had a lower rate of hematologic reconstitution (ANC >1500/µL) at D90. We observed that only 22% (2) of patients had recovered ANC > 1500/µLin the infection group as opposed to 80% (8) in the non-infection group at D90 (p= 0.038). Rates of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) were comparable between the two groups (55.6% vs 70% p=0.52). Surprisingly, rates of immune-effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) was lower (55.6%) in the infection group compared to (90%) non-infection group (p=0.09). Fourteen of 19 patients had follow-up over one year, of which 8 (57%) remained in complete remission (CR). Conclusions: We demonstrate an infection rate of 47% (9) beyond D30 in patients undergoing CD19 CAR-T. Increased ALC, lower ANC/ALC and AMC/ALC ratios at D30 may be predictive of infectious complications. Median OS has not been reached in our cohort. Given the potential clinical impact, our observations should be corroborated using larger datasets.

Now more than ever, development practitioners and the international community need to shift their approach to engaging young people in democracy and governance programs from one that views them as recipients to one that treats young people as partners and considers the unique environments in which they live.

The paper illuminates good practices and lessons learned through an exploration of global civic education programs demonstrating the utility of a PYD approach.

The mission of symbolic learning is to provide algorithms and methodologies to extract logical information from data and express it in an interpretable way. In the context of temporal data, interval temporal logic has been recently proposed as a suitable tool for symbolic learning, specifically via the design of an interval temporal logic decision tree extraction algorithm. Building on it, we study here its natural generalization to interval temporal random forests, mimicking the corresponding schema at the propositional level. Interval temporal random forests turn out to be a very performing multivariate time series classification method, which, despite the introduction of a functional component, are still logically interpretable to some extent. We apply this method to the problem of diagnosing COVID-19 based on the time series that emerge from cough and breath recording of positive versus negative subjects. Our experiment show that our models achieve very high accuracies and sensitivities, often superior to those achieved by classical methods on the same data.

In previous studies and reports from the UK and US evidence emerged that poverty-related indicators had a significant statistical effect on case and mortality rates on district level. For Germany, it has largely been assumed that poverty is an equally relevant factor influencing the transmission rates of the outbreak. This was mostly due to anecdotal evidence from local outbreaks in meat processing plants and reported incidents of infection clusters in poorer city districts. This paper addresses the lack of statistical evidence and investigates thoroughly the link between poverty-related indicators and detected infection and mortality rates of the outbreak using multivariate, multilevel regression while also considering the urban-rural divide of the country. As proxies for poverty the unemployment rate, the per capita presence of general practitioners (physicians), per capita GDP, and the rate of employees with no professional job training is evaluated in relation to the accumulated case and mortality numbers on district level taken from RKI data of June and July 2020. Interestingly, the study finds no general evidence for a poverty-related effect on mortality for German districts during the first wave in the first half of 2020. Furthermore, only employment in low qualification jobs approximated by the job training variable consistently affected case numbers in urban districts in the expected direction.

Here we report a robust and simple method to fabricate EM grids coated with single- or few-layer reduced graphene oxide (RGO) membrane in large batch for high-resolution cryo-EM structural determination. The RGO membrane has decreased interlayer space and enhanced electrical conductivity in comparison to regular graphene oxide (GO) membrane. Moreover, we found that the RGO supporting film exhibited nice particle-absorption ability, thus avoiding the air-water interface problem. More importantly, we found that the RGO supporting film is particularly useful in cryo-EM reconstruction of sub-100 kDa biomolecules at near-atomic resolution, as exemplified by the study of RBD-ACE2 complex and other small protein molecules. We envision that the RGO membranes can be used as a robust graphene-based supporting film in cryo-EM specimen preparation.","Liu, Nan; Zheng, Liming; Xu, Jie; Wang, Jia; Hu, Cuixia; Lan, Jun; Zhang, Xing; Zhang, Jincan; Xu, Kui; Cheng, Hang; Yang, Zi; Gao, Xin; Wang, Xinquan; Peng, Hailin; Chen, Yanan; Wang, Hong-Wei",bioRxiv,407,24

In this research, novel designs of optical homodyne and heterodyne detection techniques are explained. Homodyne and heterodyne setups are used for measuring the frequency of the modulated optical signal. This technique works on the principle of the optical interferometer, which provides a coherent detection of two self-mixing beams. In the optical homodyne technique, one of the two beams receives direct modulation from the vibration frequency of the test subject. In the optical heterodyne detection technique, one of the two optical beams is subjected to modulation by an acousto-optics modulator before becoming further modulated by the vibration frequency of the test subject. These two optical signals form an interference pattern that contains the information of the vibration frequency. The measurement of cardiovascular signals, such as heart rate and heart rate variability, are performed with both homodyne and heterodyne techniques. The optical coherent detection technique provides a high accuracy for the measurement of heart period and heart rate variability. The vibrocardiogram output obtained from both techniques are compared for different heart rate values. Results obtained from both optical homodyne and heterodyne detection techniques are compared and found to be within 1% of deviation value. The results obtained from both the optical techniques have a deviation of less than 1 beat per minute from their corresponding ECG values.","Panse, Meena S.",Applied System Innovation,407,1

The increasing climate chaos of the Anthropocene additionally underscores the necessity of resilient societies and individuals. Individuals able to problem-solve in emergent situations are integral to a resilient society, and science education can develop these competencies both individually and collectively. We use the concept of resiliency to argue for science education that enables learners to adapt and respond in the face of disruption, unrest, and disaster. We focus specifically on the ways in which learning how to grow plants indoors can develop resilience on multiple levels while authentically facilitating science and engineering principles. This study seeks to explore how indoor agriculture might support science education for resiliency. We examine a higher-education project, the “Grow Pod,” involving shipping container agriculture with first-year undergraduates. We argue that inclusion of indoor agriculture within science education has the potential to support both learning for and as resiliency. In our analysis, we note how the Grow Pod project supports a science education for resiliency through collective learning that helps learners understand plant basics and how to grow food, and a science education as resiliency which includes learning through and rebounding from challenges/mistakes, learning resourcefulness, and experiencing restorative benefits of working with plants. © 2021 National Association for Research in Science Teaching.","Stapleton, S.

Neither standard diagnostic testing, the detection and measurement of viral RNA (via polymerase chain reaction), or serological testing (via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) has the capability to definitively determine active infection. The former due to a lack of ability to distinguish between replicable and inert viral RNA, and the latter due to varying immune responses (ranging from latent to a complete lack of immune response altogether). Despite many companies producing rapid point-of-care (POC) tests, none will address the global scale of testing needed and few help to combat the ever growing issue of testing resource scarcity. Here we discuss our efforts towards the development of a highly manufacturable, microfluidic device that instantly indicates active viral infection status from ~ 20 μL of nasal mucus or phlegm and requires no external power. The device features a biotin functionalized silicon nanomembrane within an acrylic body containing channels and ports for sample introduction and analysis. Virus capture and target confirmation are done using affinity-based capture and size-based occlusion respectively. Modularity of the device is proven with bead and vaccinia virus capture as we work towards testing with both pure SARS-CoV-2 virus and human samples. With success on all fronts, we could achieve an inexpensive POC diagnostic which can determine an individual’s infection status, aiding containment efforts in the current and future pandemics. In addition to direct viral detection, our method can be used as a rapid POC sample preparation tool that limits the application of PCR reagents to those samples which already display viral size and antigen-based positivity through our device. © 2021 SPIE.","Klaczko, M.; Ozgurun, B.; Ward, B.; Flax, J.; McGrath, J.","Photonic Diagnosis, Monitoring, Prevention, and Treatment of Infections and Inflammatory Diseases 2021",407,16

This opportunity enabled those individuals to take stock and reflect on their own behaviours and of their team/organisation and was documented through a series of blogs.Each of the roles interviewed offered unique challenges and viewpoints. A thematic analysis analysing the behaviours and skills described was performed on the transcripts of these interviews and coded according to the domains from the FMLM standards.The transcripts were then coded using these categories and the percentage breakdown of each category identified and mapped to FMLM standards.Interviewees at all levels had experience or observed behaviours that represented the four overarching leadership domains as described by FMLM Leadership standards for healthcare professionals. There was awareness and experience at all levels up to and including systems leadership despite the individuals position. These interviews underline the importance of good leadership at times of crisis. Some interviewees displayed leadership behaviours that exceeded those that would normally be expected for their clinical position.Specific challenges relating to senior leaders included maintaining visibility and managing anxieties.

Recent advancements of digital bioassay revolutionized ALP-based diagnostic assays as seen in rapid growth of digital ELISA and the emerging multiplex profiling of single-molecule ALP isomers. However, the intrinsic heterogeneity found among ALP molecules hampers the ALP-based quantitative digital bioassays. This study aims quantitative analysis of single-molecule activities of ALP from Escherichia coli and reveals the static heterogeneity in catalytic activity of ALP with two distinct populations: half-active and fully active portions. Digital assays with serial buffer exchange uncovered single-molecule Michaelis-Menten kinetics of ALP; half-active molecules have halved values of the catalytic turnover rate, kcat, and the rate constant of productive binding, kon, of the fully active molecules. These findings suggest that half-active ALP molecules are heterogenic dimers composed of inactive and active monomer units, while fully active ALP molecules comprise two active units. Static heterogeneity was also observed for ALP with other origins: calf intestine or shrimp, showing how the findings can be generalized across species. Cell-free expression of ALP with disulfide bond enhancer and spiked zinc ion resulted in homogenous population of ALP of full activity, revealing that inactive monomer units of ALP are deficient in disulfide bond formation and zinc ion coordination, and also offering the way to prepare homogenous and active populations of ALP for quantitative digital bioassays of ALP.","Ueno, Hiroshi; Kato, Makoto; Minagawa, Yoshihiro; Hirose, Yushi; Noji, Hiroyuki",bioRxiv,407,16

Their performance is typically measured in terms of classification accuracy. While the classification error rate and the like are important, they do not address a fundamental question: Is the classification method underfitted? To our best knowledge, there is no existing method that can assess the goodness-of-fit of a general classification procedure. Indeed, the lack of a parametric assumption makes it challenging to construct proper tests. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a methodology called BAGofT that splits the data into a training set and a validation set. First, the classification procedure to assess is applied to the training set, which is also used to adaptively find a data grouping that reveals the most severe regions of underfitting. Then, based on this grouping, we calculate a test statistic by comparing the estimated success probabilities and the actual observed responses from the validation set. The data splitting guarantees that the size of the test is controlled under the null hypothesis, and the power of the test goes to one as the sample size increases under the alternative hypothesis. For testing parametric classification models, the BAGofT has a broader scope than the existing methods since it is not restricted to specific parametric models (e.g., logistic regression). Extensive simulation studies show the utility of the BAGofT when assessing general classification procedures and its strengths over some existing methods when testing parametric classification models.","Zhang, Jiawei; Ding, Jie; Yang, Yuhong",,407,22

During periods of lockdown, social media has become the main channel for citizens to exchange information with others. Public emotions are being generated and shared rapidly online with citizens using internet platforms to reduce anxiety and stress, and stay connected while isolated. Objectives : This study aims to explore the regularity of emotional evolution by examining public emotions expressed in online discussions about the Wuhan lockdown event in January 2020. Methods : Data related to the Wuhan lockdown was collected from Sina Weibo by web crawler. In this study, the Ortony, Clore, and Collins (OCC) model, Word2Vec, and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory model were employed to determine emotional types, train vectorization of words, and identify each text emotion for the training set. Latent Dirichlet Allocation models were also employed to mine the various topic categories, while topic emotional evolution was visualized. Results : Seven types of emotions and four phases were categorized to describe emotional evolution on the Wuhan lockdown event. The study found that negative emotions such as blame and fear dominated in the early days, and public attitudes towards the lockdown gradually alleviated and reached a balance as the situation improved. Emotional expression about Wuhan lockdown event were significantly related to users’ gender, location, and whether or not their account was verified. There were statistically significant correlations between different emotions within the subtle emotional categories. In addition, the evolution of emotions presented a different path due to different topics. Conclusions : Multiple emotional categories were determined in our study, providing a detailed and explainable emotion analysis to explored emotional appeal of citizen. The public emotions were gradually easing related to the Wuhan lockdown event, there yet exists regional discrimination and post-traumatic stress disorder in this process, which would lead us to pay continuous attention to citizens lives and psychological status post-pandemic. In addition, this study provided an appropriate method and reference case for the government's public opinion control and emotional appeasement.","Cao, Guang; Shen, Lining; Evans, Richard; Zhang, Zhiguo; Bi, Qiqing; Huang, Wenjing; Yao, Rui; Zhang, Wenli",,407,16

The Indonesian Financial Services Authority (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, OJK) issued a credit restructuring policy, effective from March 2020 to March 2022, to reduce credit and bank capital risk. This study proposes the bank risk scenario after the credit restructuring policy of the OJK moratorium in March 2022 and proposes the internal bank policy simulation to mitigate credit and capital risks in terms of Non-Performing Loan (NPL) and Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR). The difficulty of this study is how to develop the risk scenario and to simulate the bank risk mitigation policy after the policy moratorium, while the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing and the economy is not yet normal. To that purpose, this study uses a system dynamics methodology with Powersim Studio 10© software that is able to make scenarios on the level of credit risk (NPL) and bank capital (CAR) and able to simulate internal bank policy to overcome the risk by considering the environmental and policy changes. Based on the policy simulation, it is recommended that bank can implement the restructuring policy to control the credit risk and strengthening the NPL monitoring activity in order to manage and decrease the loan impairment expenses. To increase CAR, the result shows that the combined policy consists of the NPL monitoring program, the interest rate and the operating cost management program is able to produce a significant increase in bank’s capital (CAR).

Data from an Internet survey of cannabis users during the COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed (N = 2,319). Approximately 18% of the sample identified as LGBTQ. Bivariate analyses were used to examine the relationship between LGBTQ identity and symptoms of anxiety and depression, substance use, and pandemic-related coping strategies and stressors. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between pandemic stressors and coping strategies with LGBTQ identity, while adjusting for sex, age, and race and ethnicity. Differences in the proportion of medicinal cannabis use among LGBTQ respondents (74.6%) and non-LGBTQ respondents (75.3%) were insignificant. LGBTQ cannabis users were more likely to report COVID-19-related stressors and coping behaviors, including increased alcohol use. After adjustment for covariates, LGBTQ cannabis users were more likely to report symptoms of depression and anxiety than non-LGBTQ cannabis users. These results show that compared to their cisgender heterosexual counterparts, LGBTQ cannabis users are experiencing more problematic mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHOD The proposed chemical approaches included silanizing the slides with 3-glycid-oxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GOPS) after cleaning, followed by slide coating with polymers (poly-L-lysine) that was covalently bound to the modified glass. Subsequent attachment of the oligonucleotide to the modified slide surface was achieved after 1,4-phenylene diisothiocyanate (PDITC) activation of the surface. Various experiments were carried out, such as the immobilization efficiency and hybridization assays to test the modified slides, which were then used tentatively in the preparation of microarrays for SARS coronavirus detection. RESULTS The improved surface had high immobilization efficiency, good uniformity and satisfactory hybridization efficiency, better than those slides with conventional poly-L-lysine coating. In addition, such modified slides rendered the microarrays more resistant to consecutive probing/stripping cycles. CONCLUSION The modified slide surface is satisfactory to immobilize unmodified oligonucleotide by covalent binding, which enhances not only the sensitivity of the prepared oligonucleotide microarray but also the binding of the oligonucleotide to the slide surface.","Wu, Qing-hua; Ma, Wen-li; Shi, Rong; Guo, Qiu-ye; Zhang, Bao; Li, Ling; Zhang, Hai-yan; Zheng, Wen-ling",Di 1 jun yi da xue xue bao = Academic journal of the first medical college of PLA,407,19

Exposure to haze is linked to ophthalmic, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and mortality. In this study, we investigated the role of demographic factors, knowledge and perceived risk in influencing protective behaviours during the 2013 haze in Singapore. METHODS We evaluated 696 adults in a cross-sectional study. Participants were sampled via a 2-stage simple random sampling without replacement from a large residential district in Singapore in 2015. The questionnaire measured the participant's knowledge, perceived risk and behaviours during the Southeast Asian haze crisis in 2013. Reliability and validity of the questionnaire were assessed using comparative fit index (≥0.96) and root mean square error of approximation (≤0.05). We performed structural equation modelling to examine the relationship between the hypothesised factors and protective behaviours. RESULTS More than 95% of the individuals engaged in at least 1 form of protective behaviour. Knowledge was strongly associated with protective behaviours via direct effect (β=0.45, 95% CI 0.19-0.69, P<0.001) and indirect effect through perceived risk (β=0.18, 95% CI 0.07-0.31, P=0.002). Perceived risk was associated with protective behaviours (β=0.28, 95% CI:0.11-0.44, P=0.002). A lower household income and ethnic minority were associated with protective behaviours. A lower education level and smokers were associated with lower knowledge of haze. A higher education and ethnic minority were associated with a lower perceived risk. Wearing of N95 masks was associated with other haze-related protective behaviours (β=0.24, 95% CI 0.08-0.37, P=0.001). CONCLUSION Knowledge was associated with protective behaviours, suggesting the importance of public education. Efforts should target those of lower education level and smokers. The wearing of N95 masks correlates with uptake of other protective behaviours.","Ng, Kennedy Y Y; Yeung, Wesley; Sou, Ka Lon; Lim, Jie Xin; Liang, Sai; Lee, Ryan K J; Fong, Nigel J M; Lua, Alex; Look, Xinqi; Ann-Lee, Julia; Leong, Yun Hao; Chong, Claudia; Ang, Kai Yun; Lie, Cheryl; Chin, Amanda; Sng, Judy Gek Khim; Tai, Bee Choo","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",407,22

METHOD A transversal epidemiological survey was conducted on a randomly selected sample of the above practitioners between June and July 2008. The percentage of patients presenting on a routine working day with open a cutaneous lesion of any origin, location, size and duration was assessed. All local and systemic care performed on the patient during that day because of the wound was also recorded. RESULTS In total, 475 GPs, 453 specialists and 238 nurses participated (n=1166) and saw a total of 29 663 patients, of whom 3037 presented with one or more cutaneous wound. The overall non-weighted prevalence of patients with a wound was 10.2% (95%CI: 9.9%;10.6%). This prevalence was similar for GPs (6.0%) and for specialists (6.9%), but was higher for nurses (22.0%). Forty-three per cent of all wounds had a duration of over 6 weeks. These chronic wounds were predominantly leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers or pressure ulcers, but also included wounds of all aetiologies. For 33% of all patients with wounds, the impact on their health status was serious to severe. The overwhelming majority of wounds (95%) required local care, including in 65% of cases cleansing and debridement. CONCLUSION Despite its limitations, this initiative, the first of its type in France, strongly suggests that wound care constitutes an important part of routine care given by health professionals in the community, and for a substantial number of these patients, wounds represent a serious morbidity.

Due to the blood-brain barrier, they are mostly inaccessible to traditional chemotherapy. We have recently shown that doxorubicin bound to polysorbate-coated nanoparticles crossed the intact blood-brain barrier, thus reaching therapeutic concentrations in the brain. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of this formulation of doxorubicin in vivo using an animal model created by implantation of 101/8 glioblastoma tumor in rat brains. Groups of 5-8 glioblastoma-bearing rats (total n = 151) were subjected to 3 cycles of 1.5-2.5 mg/kg body weight of doxorubicin in different formulations, including doxorubicin bound to polysorbate-coated nanoparticles. The animals were analyzed for survival (% median increase of survival time, Kaplan-Meier). Preliminary histology including immunocytochemistry (glial fibrillary acidic protein, ezrin, proliferation and apoptosis) was also performed. Rats treated with doxorubicin bound to polysorbate-coated nanoparticles had significantly higher survival times compared with all other groups. Over 20% of the animals in this group showed a long-term remission. Preliminary histology confirmed lower tumor sizes and lower values for proliferation and apoptosis in this group. All groups of animals treated with polysorbate-containing formulations also had a slight inflammatory reaction to the tumor. There was no indication of neurotoxicity. Additionally, binding to nanoparticles may reduce the systemic toxicity of doxorubicin. This study showed that therapy with doxorubicin bound to nanoparticles offers a therapeutic potential for the treatment of human glioblastoma.","Steiniger, Sebastian C J; Kreuter, Jörg; Khalansky, Alexander S; Skidan, Igor N; Bobruskin, Alexey I; Smirnova, Zoya S; Severin, Sergey E; Uhl, Reiner; Kock, Martin; Geiger, Kathrin D; Gelperina, Svetlana E",International journal of cancer,407,9

Despite regular vaccination of incoming dogs against distemper, canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), and canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), respiratory disease was endemic. Tissue samples from the respiratory tract as well as paired serum samples were collected for analysis. The development of PCR assays for the detection of CPIV, canine adenovirus types 1 and 2, and canine herpesvirus (CHV) is described. Surprisingly, canine adenovirus was not detected in samples from this population, whereas 19.4% of tracheal and 10.4% of lung samples were positive for CPIV and 12.8% of tracheal and 9.6% of lung samples were positive for CHV. As reported previously, a novel canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) was detected in this population (K. Erles, C. Toomey, H. W. Brooks, and J. Brownlie, Virology 310:216-223, 2003). Infections with CRCoV occurred mostly during the first week of a dog's stay at the kennel, whereas CPIV and CHV were detected at later time points. Furthermore, the evaluation of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of antibodies to CPIV and an immunofluorescence assay for detection of antibodies to CHV is described. This study shows that CPIV is present at kennels despite vaccination. In addition, other agents such as CHV and CRCoV may play a role in the pathogenesis of canine respiratory disease, whereas CAV-2 and canine distemper virus were not present in this population, indicating that their prevalence in the United Kingdom is low due to widespread vaccination of dogs.","Erles, Kerstin; Dubovi, Edward J; Brooks, Harriet W; Brownlie, Joe",Journal of clinical microbiology,407,1

Many of the analyses to date have involved fitting predictions from a transmission model to the observed epidemic curves from different settings. METHODS Using morbidity data from cities in Europe and America and from confined settings during the 1918 influenza pandemic, we contrast the use of several different methods based on the growth rate and final size of the epidemic, which do not rely on transmission models, to estimate the effective and basic reproduction numbers. RESULTS The effective reproduction number (the average number of secondary infectious cases produced by a typical infectious case in a given population) for the 1918 influenza virus was in the range 1.2-3.0 and 2.1-7.5 for community-based and confined settings, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Assuming further that 30 and 50% of individuals were immune to Spanish influenza after the wave in April 1918 and the first subsequent wave, respectively, these findings imply that, in a totally susceptible population, an infectious case could have led to 2.4-4.3 and 2.6-10.6 cases in community-based and confined settings, respectively. These findings for community-based populations confirm the relatively low transmissibility of the 1918 (Spanish) influenza virus, which has been found by other studies using alternative data sources and methods.","Vynnycky, Emilia; Trindall, Amy; Mangtani, Punam",International journal of epidemiology,407,28

However, previous studies suggested that none of the currently sampled bat SLCoVs is the descendant of the direct ancestor of SCoV, based on their relatively distant phylogenetic relationship. In this study, evidence of the recombinant origin of the genome of a bat SLCoV is demonstrated. We identified a potential recombination breakpoint immediately after the consensus intergenic sequence between open reading frame 1 and the S coding region, suggesting the replication intermediates may participate in the recombination event, as previously speculated for other CoVs. Phylogenetic analysis of its parental regions suggests the presence of an uncharacterized SLCoV lineage that is phylogenetically closer to SCoVs than any of the currently sampled bat SLCoVs. Using various Bayesian molecular-clock models, interspecies transfer of this SLCoV lineage from bats to the amplifying host (e.g., civets) was estimated to have happened a median of 4.08 years before the SARS outbreak. Based on this relatively short window period, we speculate that this uncharacterized SLCoV lineage may contain the direct ancestor of SCoV. This study sheds light on the possible host bat species of the direct ancestor of SCoV, providing valuable information on the scope and focus of surveillance for the origin of SCoV.","Hon, Chung-Chau; Lam, Tsan-Yuk; Shi, Zheng-Li; Drummond, Alexei J; Yip, Chi-Wai; Zeng, Fanya; Lam, Pui-Yi; Leung, Frederick Chi-Ching",Journal of virology,407,28

Heart rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were recorded daily. Severity of lung changes on chest radiographs was scored according to percentage of involved lung. Radiographic scores at days of admission, treatment, and maximal radiographic score were extracted for statistical analysis with clinical parameters. Time to maximal radiographic score from admission and days between onset and beginning of treatment were determined. Correlations between radiographic and clinical parameters were evaluated with Spearman rank correlation. Sex differences with respect to clinical and radiographic parameters were evaluated with Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS Median chest radiographic scores peaked 5 days after beginning of treatment before they declined. Maximal and treatment radiographic scores were inversely related to oxygen saturation (r = -0.67, P <.001; r = -0.35, P =.03). Admission radiographic score was correlated with admission AST level (r = 0.53, P =.003); treatment radiographic score, with treatment ALT and AST levels (r = 0.43, P =.007; r = 0.42, P =.019); and time to maximal radiographic score, with AST level at maximal radiographic score (r = -0.45, P =.006), admission radiographic score (r = -0.55, P <.001), treatment radiographic score (r = -0.58, P <.001), and admission ALT and AST levels (r = -0.44, P =.007; r = -0.58, P =.001). Treatment delay was associated with AST level at maximal radiographic score (r = 0.53, P =.001), treatment radiographic score (r = 0.60, P <.001), and time to maximal radiographic score (r = -0.36, P =.02).

This is the reason why the most important international organizations recommend that the dentists adopt a unique preventive approach to the problem: SARS patients should not be treated in the dental office. This is possible only if a suspected case of SARS is correctly and promptly identified. But a correct identification is made difficult by several factors, such as the incubation period, a possibly asymptomatic onset of the illness, the still low specificity and sensitivity of laboratory and instrumental tests. A case or suspected case of SARS may thus unwillingly be treated at the dental office. It is therefore necessary to adopt protective measures for the dental personnel and to implement and enforce infection control measures in order to eliminate the risk of viral contamination. Nonetheless, these procedures do not ensure a complete elimination of SARS-CoV contamination risk since a major risk is represented by blood-borne infection, which is originated by the mouth of patients, and the contamination of dental units water lines (DUWLs) is most difficult to control. Blood-borne contamination may be achieved only by adopting a high level, between-patients disinfection protocol of the DUWLs based on the use of chemical agents with biocidal activity against spores, viruses, bacteria and fungi (Autosteril method). In conclusion a fully effective control of the cross-infection risk will be obtained only by adopting a correct, integrated use of different infection control procedures.","Testarelli, L; D' Aversa, L; Dolci, G",Minerva stomatologica,407,16

Global threats from indoor and outdoor air pollution, urban crowding, biologic weapons, and worldwide rapid transportation complicate our efforts to reduce the impact of LRI disease in children. As new strategies are developed to limit the spread of LRI disease in children, existing pathogens become more complex to treat and newer pathogens emerge as causes of clinical disease. Most LRI disease is managed in outpatient settings and remains a challenge to those who care for children. RECENT FINDINGS Atypical pathogens (notably mycoplasma pneumoniae) are now known to cause a wide spectrum of disease, and with more extensive complications than previously recognized. Available data suggest a rapid increase in S. pneumoniae resistance to penicillin and macrolides in many cases of community acquired pneumonia, which has resulted in shifts in outpatient (and inpatient) antibiotic treatment regimens. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is now recognized to cause LRI illness similar to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants and children. General strategies for the prevention of influenza infection are expanded to include many infants and young children, and are projected to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality from this key LRI pathogen. SUMMARY The spectrum of LRI pathogens--and the clinical illnesses caused by them--continues to change. Innovations in immunotherapy and vaccines will be instrumental to reducing the burden of LRI morbidity in infants and children worldwide in the future.","Klig, Jean E; Shah, Nikhil B",Current opinion in pediatrics,407,16

Several mechanisms are advanced to explain this collusion. Obesity leads to an altered and delayed initial immune response, a chronic low-grade inflammation that promotes cytokine storm and a hypercoagulable state. Diagnosis is sometimes delayed by a tendency for these patients to avoid medical consultations and care complicated by weight and ventilation difficulties.

Blister aneurysms are uncommon and fragile lesions that historically have high rates of morbidity and mortality despite multiple treatment strategies. We report a case of rebleeding after treatment of a ruptured blister aneurysm with deployment of a single FDS. CLINICAL PRESENTATION A 29-year-old man presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage and a ruptured dorsal variant internal carotid artery aneurysm. Despite a technically successful treatment with a single FDS, a second catastrophic hemorrhage occurred during the course of his hospitalization. CONCLUSION This case highlights the risk of hemorrhage during the period after deployment of a single FDS. Ruptured aneurysms, especially of the blister type, are at risk for rehemorrhage while the occlusion remains incomplete after flow diversion.

DESIGN A randomized, parallel-group, pragmatic trial of video compared with direct laryngoscopy for 150 adults undergoing endotracheal intubation by Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine fellows. SETTING Medical ICU in a tertiary, academic medical center. PATIENTS Critically ill patients 18 years old or older. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized 1:1 to video or direct laryngoscopy for the first attempt at endotracheal intubation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Patients assigned to video (n = 74) and direct (n = 76) laryngoscopy were similar at baseline. Despite better glottic visualization with video laryngoscopy, there was no difference in the primary outcome of intubation on the first laryngoscopy attempt (video 68.9% vs direct 65.8%; p = 0.68) in unadjusted analyses or after adjustment for the operator's previous experience with the assigned device (odds ratio for video laryngoscopy on intubation on first attempt 2.02; 95% CI, 0.82-5.02, p = 0.12). Secondary outcomes of time to intubation, lowest arterial oxygen saturation, complications, and in-hospital mortality were not different between video and direct laryngoscopy.

The set of manual skin tone rating experiments shows that there are inconsistencies between human raters that are difficult to eliminate. Efforts to automate skin tone rating suggest that it is particularly challenging on images collected without a calibration object in the scene. However, after the color-correction, the level of agreement between automated and manual approaches is found to be 96% or better for the MORPH images.

While the knowledge on the acute phase of the disease has rapidly expanded, little is known on the consequences of COVID-19 following clinical remission. We set up a multidisciplinary COVID-19 follow-up outpatient clinic to identify and address the clinical needs of COVID-19 survivors. Here we describe the features of our follow-up programme. METHODS: The multidisciplinary assessment comprises a complete physical examination, respiratory evaluation (peripheral oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, dyspnoea assessment, lung ultrasound and pulmonary function), cardiovascular assessment (electrocardiography, echocardiography), nutritional assessment (anthropometrics, mini Nutritional Assessment screening tool), neurological examination including cognitive tests, and mental health assessment. All data are prospectively collected, and blood is sampled for biobanking. RESULTS: Since 7 April to 5 June, 2020, 453 out of the 1388 COVID-19 survivors managed at our University Hospital have been evaluated at the Outpatient COVID-19 Follow-up Clinic. The characteristics of the follow-up cohort are similar to those of the whole cohort of COVID-19 in terms of demographics, comorbidities, and COVID-19 severity upon ED presentation, indicating that the follow-up cohort is representative of the whole cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous patient monitoring might give an answer to the numerous unsolved questions about what comes next in this pandemic and beyond. This will help physicians and researchers establish strategies to face future pandemics and develop preventative and therapeutic strategies for similar hyperinflammatory conditions.","Rovere Querini, Patrizia; De Lorenzo, Rebecca; Conte, Caterina; Brioni, Elena; Lanzani, Chiara; Yacoub, Mona Rita; Chionna, Raffaella; Martinenghi, Sabina; Vitali, Giordano; Tresoldi, Moreno; Ciceri, Fabio",Acta Biomed,407,29

This review's aim was to explore the existing literature on emerging infectious disease outbreaks to identify factors associated with compliance with infection control measures among healthcare staff. METHODS: A rapid evidence review for primary studies relevant to healthcare workers' compliance with infection control measures. RESULTS: Fifty-six papers were reviewed. Staff working in emergency or intensive care settings or with contact with confirmed cases appeared more likely to comply with recommendations. There was some evidence that anxiety and concern about the risk of infection were more associated with compliance, and that monitoring from superiors could improve compliance. Observed non-compliance of colleagues could hinder compliance. Staff identified many barriers to compliance related to personal protective equipment, including availability, perceived difficulty and effectiveness, inconvenience, discomfort and a negative impact on patient care. There were many issues regarding the communication and ease of understanding of infection control guidance. CONCLUSION: We recommend provision of training and education tailored for different occupational roles within the healthcare setting, managerial staff 'leading by example', ensuring adequate resources for infection control and timely provision of practical evidence-based infection control guidelines.","Brooks, Samantha K; Greenberg, N; Wessely, Simon; Rubin, G J",BMJ Open,407,16

Global solidarity is threatened, with the USA, United Kingdom, European Union and Japan having secured 1.3 billion doses of potential vaccines as of August 2020. Vaccines ran out even before their approval with three candidates from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca having shown good Phase III results in November 2020.

The wastewater sector is critical to public health protection and employs collection and treatment system workers who perform tasks with high potential for exposures to biological agents. While various technical guidances and reports have initially provided direction to the water sector, the rapidly growing body of research publications necessitates the constant review of these papers and data synthesis. This paper presents the latest findings and highlights their implications from a water and wastewater utility operation and management perspective. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Extrapolation from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, as well as other surrogates, has helped predicting SARS-CoV-2 behavior and risk management. Data from treated wastewater effluent suggest that current processes are sufficient for SARS-CoV-2 control. Scientific evidence supports the possibility of fecal-oral transmission for SARS-CoV-2. Limited evidence supports the potential survival of infective SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces and in aerosols and the efficacy of control measures at reducing transmission.

Since at present the outbreak continues to evolve (April 2020), the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a public health emergency of international concern, specifying that public health interventions aimed at the prevention of the further spread of this disease include quarantine. Quarantine, that may be defined as a restraint on the activities of people or on the traffic of goods, targeted to the prevention of the diffusion of communicable pathologies, is a health concept profoundly rooted in the history of mankind. The lessons of the past are always pertinent for the present and for the future, in particular from a public health standpoint. One of the most relevant of them is connected with previous influenza pandemics, similar to the current COVID-19 2019/2020 pandemic, and it indicates that it is practically impossible, even in recent times, to contain the infection in the geographic area where it has risen and to prevent its trans-national disseminated spread. With specific reference to the COVID-19 pandemic, therefore, health authorities still adopt ""classical"" preventive interventions, namely workplace social distancing measures and quarantine, to reduce the transmission of the disease. Only the future will testify the precise overall effectiveness of preventive public health measures in containing the impact of the present coronavirus pandemic.

Objective: In this video, we present our extensive protocol of donning and doffing of PPE which we have devised for our operating room. Technique: Donning consists of wearing of the PPE in a proper sequence so as to afford maximal protection from viral infection while conducting the surgical procedure. Various components of PPE and procedure of donning is shown followed by doffing, the sequential and safe removal of the PPE. Results: A meticulous method of donning and doffing PPE for neurosurgeons handling COVID-19 positive / suspect cases has been shown . Conclusion: Proper sequence of donning and doffing of PPE gear is of crucial importance during the COVID pandemic to prevent infection to the health care workers while handling COVID-19 positive/suspect cases and this video demonstrates the protocol we use at our institute.","Verma, Satish Kumar; Dharanipathy, Sundarakrishnan; Suri, Ashish; Chandra, P Sarat; Kale, Shashank Sharad",Neurol India,407,22

However, prominent regions of hypoxia are a common feature of infected and inflamed tissues and many chronic inflammatory respiratory diseases are associated with mucosal and systemic hypoxia. The airway epithelium represents a key interface with the external environment and is the first line of defense against potentially harmful agents including respiratory pathogens. The protective arsenal of the airway epithelium is provided in the form of physical barriers, and the production of an array of antimicrobial host defense molecules, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, in response to activation by receptors. Dysregulation of the airway epithelial innate immune response is associated with a compromised immunity and chronic inflammation of the lung. An increasing body of evidence indicates a distinct role for hypoxia in the dysfunction of the airway epithelium and in the responses of both innate immunity and of respiratory pathogens. Here we review the current evidence around the role of tissue hypoxia in modulating the host-pathogen interaction at the airway epithelium. Furthermore, we highlight the work needed to delineate the role of tissue hypoxia in the pathophysiology of chronic inflammatory lung diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in addition to novel respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the epithelial-pathogen interactions in the setting of hypoxia will enable better understanding of persistent infections and complex disease processes in chronic inflammatory lung diseases and may aid the identification of novel therapeutic targets and strategies.","Page, Lee K; Staples, Karl J; Spalluto, C Mirella; Watson, Alastair; Wilkinson, Tom M A",Front Immunol,407,31

In Germany, the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown caused a substantial decrease in mobility, possibly affecting noise levels. The aim is to analyze the effects of the lockdown measures on noise levels in the densely populated Ruhr Area. We focus on the analysis of noise levels before and during lockdown considering different land use types, weekdays, and time of day. METHODS: We used data from 22 automatic sound devices of the SALVE (Acoustic Quality and Health in Urban Environments) project, running since 2019 in Bochum, Germany. We performed a pre/during lockdown comparison of A-weighted equivalent continuous sound pressure levels. The study period includes five weeks before and five weeks during the SARS-CoV-2 induced administrative lockdown measures starting on 16 March 2020. We stratified our data by land use category (LUC), days of the week, and daytime. RESULTS: We observed highest noise levels pre-lockdown in the 'main street' and 'commercial areas' (68.4 +/- 6.7 dB resp. 61.0 +/- 8.0 dB), while in 'urban forests' they were lowest (50.9 +/- 6.6 dB). A distinct mean overall noise reduction of 5.1 dB took place, with noise reductions occurring in each LUC. However, the magnitude of noise levels differed considerably between the categories. Weakest noise reductions were found in the 'main street' (3.9 dB), and strongest in the 'urban forest', 'green space', and 'residential area' (5.9 dB each). CONCLUSIONS: Our results are in line with studies from European cities. Strikingly, all studies report noise reductions of about 5 dB. Aiming at a transformation to a health-promoting urban mobility can be a promising approach to mitigating health risks of noise in cities. Overall, the experiences currently generated by the pandemic offer data for best practices and policies for the development of healthy urban transportation-the effects of a lower traffic and more tranquil world were experienced firsthand by people during this time.","Hornberg, J.; Haselhoff, T.; Lawrence, B.

HPC has been widely used in computer science (CS) and other traditionally computation intensive disciplines, but has remained largely siloed away from the vast array of social, behavioral, business and economics disciplines. However, with ubiquitous big data, there is a compelling need to make HPC technologically and economically accessible, easy to use, and operationally democratized. Therefore, this research focuses on making two key contributions, the first is the articulation of strategies based on availability, accessibility and usability for the demystification and democratization of HPC, based on an analytical review of Caliburn, a notable supercomputer at its inception. The second contribution is a set of principles for HPC adoption based on an experiential narrative of HPC usage for textual analytics and NLP of social media data from a first time user perspective. Both, the HPC usage process and the output of the early stage analytics are summarized. This research study synthesizes expert input on HPC democratization strategies, and chronicles the challenges and opportunities from a multidisciplinary perspective, of a case of rapid adoption of supercomputing for textual analytics and NLP. Deductive logic is used to identify strategies which can lead to efficacious engagement, adoption, production and sustained usage for research, teaching, application and innovation by researchers, faculty, professionals and students across a broad range of disciplines.","Samuel, Jim; Brennan-Tonetta, Margaret; Samuel, Yana; Subedi, Pradeep; Smith, Jack",,407,15

Recent work has shown that highly correlated ionic systems behave differently than dilute electrolyte solutions, and interest is focused upon characterizing the electrical and structural properties of the dense electrical double layers (EDLs) formed at internal interfaces. It has been a challenge for experiments to characterize the progressive development of the EDL on the nanoscale as the interfacial electric potential is varied over a range of positive and negative values. Here we address this challenge by measuring X-ray reflectivity from the interface between an ionic liquid (IL) and a dilute aqueous electrolyte solution over a range of interfacial potentials from -450 to 350 mV. The growth of alternately charged cation-rich and anion-rich layers was observed along with a polarity reversal of the layers as the potential changed sign. These data show that the structural development of an ionic multilayer-like EDL with increasing potential is similar to that suggested by phenomenological theories and MD simulations, although our data also reveal that the excess charge beyond the first ionic layer decays more rapidly than predicted.","Katakura, Seiji; Amano, Ken-Ichi; Sakka, Tetsuo; Bu, Wei; Lin, Binhua; Schlossman, Mark L; Nishi, Naoya",J Phys Chem B,407,1

METHODS: We assessed the presence of viral RNA in samples from environmental surfaces before and after UV LED irradiation in COVID-19 patient rooms after patient discharge. RESULTS: This study analyzed 216 environmental samples from 17 rooms (two from airborne infection isolation rooms [AIIRs] in the intensive care unit [ICU] and 15 from isolation rooms in the community treatment center [CTC]). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was detected in 40 (18.5%) of 216 samples after patient discharge: 12 (33.3%) of 36 samples from AIIRs in the ICU, and 28 (15.6%) of 180 samples from isolation rooms in the CTC. In one AIIR, all samples were PCR-negative after UV LED irradiation. In the CTC rooms, 14 (8.6%) of the 163 samples were PCR-positive after UV LED irradiation. However, viable virus was not recovered from the culture of any of the PCR-positive samples. CONCLUSIONS: Although no viable virus was recovered, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on various environmental surfaces. The use of a UV LED disinfection robot was effective in a spacious areas such as an ICU, but its effects varied in small spaces like CTC rooms. This suggests that the UV LED robot may need enough space to disinfect rooms without re-contamination by machine wheels or insufficient disinfection by shadowing.","Choi, Hee Kyoung; Cui, Chunguang; Seok, Hyeri; Bae, Joon-Yong; Jeon, Ji Hoon; Lee, Gee Eun; Choi, Won Suk; Park, Man-Seong; Park, Dae Won",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,407,16

The United States (U.S.) leads the world with 30,291,863 confirmed reported cases and 549,664 deaths as of March 29, 2021 compared to globally confirmed cases at 127,442,926 and 2,787,915 deaths as of March 29, 2021. The U.S. federal government primarily left the response to the virus to individual states, and each implemented varying measures designed to protect health of citizens and the state's economic well-being. Unintended consequences of the virus and measures to stop its spread may include decreased physical activity and exercise, shifting access and consumption of food, and lower quality-of-life. Therefore, our primary goal was to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on health and well-being by measuring changes in physical activity, mental health-quality of life, food security and nutrition in adults ages 40 and older. We believed shifts in health behaviors would be more prevalent in minorities, less educated, lower socio-economic status, older adults, and those with underlying health conditions, so a secondary goal was to determine the impact of COVID-19 on these sub-populations. METHODS: We conducted an online survey with 9969 adults 40 years and older between 9 August and 15 September 2020 in urban areas across the four U.S. census regions. The survey included questions about demographic variables, pre-existing health conditions, physical activity, access to food, quality-of-life, and nutritional food status and asked participants to respond with information from pre-pandemic and pandemic conditions. We used paired-sample t-tests to detect changes in variables after the start of the pandemic and Cohen's d to determine effect sizes. RESULTS: Our main findings showed a decrease in physical activity since the onset of COVID-19 for minorities and non-minorities. Food security also slightly increased for minorities during the pandemic, but we found no other changes in food security, quality-of-life indicators, or nutritional status of those who responded to this survey. CONCLUSIONS: It is concerning that physical activity declined. Such activity helps maintain physical and mental health, and it is also an important time to socialize for many older adults. In many ways, our data indicate that the older adult population in U.S. cities may be more resilient than expected during the pandemic. However, the pandemic could have negative impacts that we did not detect, either due to the survey instrument or the timing of our survey, so the health and well-being of older adults should continue to be monitored in order to mitigate potential negative impacts.","Harrison, Elgloria; Monroe-Lord, Lillie; Carson, Andrew D; Jean-Baptiste, Anne Marie; Phoenix, Janet; Jackson, Phronie; Harris, B Michelle; Asongwed, Elmira; Richardson, Matthew L",BMC Public Health,407,20

In this study, we analyzed methylation status of 93 CpG sites, densely scattered within approximately 1.5 kb 5' regulatory region of CYP1A1, and its association with gene transcription in tissue cohorts dissected from 40 patients with gastric cancer. Bisulfite sequencing and the resulting methylation percentages revealed dynamically methylated CpG sites located within or around xenobiotic response elements (XRE) 4-10, and a region of consistent hypermethylation located near proximal promoter, encompassing XRE2-3. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences of the methylation percentages at CpG sites -1415 (0.032) and -1524 (P=0.041) (located at the close upstream region of XRE10) between cancerous and normal gastric tissues as well as between those with and without lymphatic involvement. Quantitative real time PCR analysis showed that the CYP1A1 gene expression significantly increased in cancerous tissues compared to their normal tissue cohort, and is significantly associated with hypomethylation at the CpG sites -1383 (P=0.018) existing within the XRE10 motif. These data suggest that the variably methylated CpG site existing in the 5' regulatory region of CYP1A1 gene, corresponding with the XRE10 regulatory region, is associated with the CYP1A1 gene upregulation and likely involved in gastric cancer incidence and metastasis. Methylation analysis of the CpG sites located within or around the XRE10 motif of the CYP1A1 promoter can be used as a potential marker to evaluate individual susceptibility to gastric cancer.","Sadeghi-Amiri, L; Barzegar, A; Nikbakhsh-Zati, N; Mehraban, P",Gene,407,2

Under the situation that major economies are under impact, how the cold chain industry can further develop has attracted widespread attention in the academic community. In order to make up for the imperfect deficiencies in the index system of cold chain logistics influencing factors in the existing literature, while considering that existing studies rarely pay attention to the impact of the epidemic on the cold chain industry. Based on the ISM model, this article compares and analyzes factors such as the lack of construction of a cold chain logistics standardization system. Research shows that product quality and safety and information system construction are factors at level one, so they are the most critical factors affecting the development of cold chain logistics.

Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in the Community of Madrid, which has the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Spain. We included 143 adult patients with ITP (130 with chronic ITP, 8 with persistent ITP, and 5 with newly diagnosed ITP). We conducted a telephone survey to collect the data and created a registry. Materials and Methods: Overall, 24 patients presented symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, which was confirmed by RT-PCR in 8 cases. The cumulative incidence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher in the patients with ITP than in the Madrid population. There were no differences in the disease incidence or clinical course of infection in the patients treated with immunosuppressants. Almost all of the patients reported adherence to the prescribed treatment, although 49.2% of the hospital visits were either cancelled or postponed, 17.2% because of the patients' fear of coming to the centre. Nearly half of the cohort was considered vulnerable, and 17% had been granted a dependency or disability benefit. Conclusions: COVID-19 had a major impact on the psychosocial, occupational, and quality of care of patients with ITP.","Román, María-Teresa Álvarez; Jiménez Yuste, Víctor; García Barcenilla, Sara; Ramírez López, Andrés; Monzón Manzano, Elena; de la Cruz Benito, Beatriz; Butta, Paula Acuña; Rivas Pollmar, María Isabel; Trelles Martínez, Roberto; González Zorrilla, Elena; Martín Salces, Mónica; Cebanu, Tamara; Butta, Nora V",Medicina (Kaunas),407,22

Thus, early identification of patients at risk of poor outcomes is critical. Our objective was to analyse SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in serum as a severity biomarker in COVID-19. Retrospective observational study including 193 patients admitted for COVID-19. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum (viremia) was performed with samples collected at 48-72 h of admission by two techniques from Roche and Thermo Fischer Scientific (TFS). Main outcome variables were mortality and need for ICU admission during hospitalization for COVID-19. Viremia was detected in 50-60% of patients depending on technique. The correlation of Ct in serum between both techniques was good (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.612; p < 0.001). Patients with viremia were older (p = 0.006), had poorer baseline oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2; p < 0.001), more severe lymphopenia (p < 0.001) and higher LDH (p < 0.001), IL-6 (p = 0.021), C-reactive protein (CRP; p = 0.022) and procalcitonin (p = 0.002) serum levels. We defined ""relevant viremia"" when detection Ct was < 34 with Roche and < 31 for TFS. These thresholds had 95% sensitivity and 35% specificity. Relevant viremia predicted death during hospitalization (OR 9.2 [3.8-22.6] for Roche, OR 10.3 [3.6-29.3] for TFS; p < 0.001). Cox regression models, adjusted by age, sex and Charlson index, identified increased LDH serum levels and relevant viremia (HR = 9.87 [4.13-23.57] for TFS viremia and HR = 7.09 [3.3-14.82] for Roche viremia) as the best markers to predict mortality. Viremia assessment at admission is the most useful biomarker for predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients. Viremia is highly reproducible with two different techniques (TFS and Roche), has a good consistency with other severity biomarkers for COVID-19 and better predictive accuracy.","Rodríguez-Serrano, Diego A; Roy-Vallejo, Emilia; Zurita Cruz, Nelly D; Martín Ramírez, Alexandra; Rodríguez-García, Sebastián C; Arevalillo-Fernández, Nuria; Galván-Román, José María; Fontán García-Rodrigo, Leticia; Vega-Piris, Lorena; Chicot Llano, Marta; Arribas Méndez, David; González de Marcos, Begoña; Hernando Santos, Julia; Sánchez Azofra, Ana; Ávalos Pérez-Urria, Elena; Rodriguez-Cortes, Pablo; Esparcia, Laura; Marcos-Jimenez, Ana; Sánchez-Alonso, Santiago; Llorente, Irene; Soriano, Joan; Suárez Fernández, Carmen; García-Vicuña, Rosario; Ancochea, Julio; Sanz, Jesús; Muñoz-Calleja, Cecilia; de la Cámara, Rafael; Canabal Berlanga, Alfonso; González-Álvaro, Isidoro; Cardeñoso, Laura",Sci Rep,407,5

Maintaining blood supply during the COVID-19 pandemic is a huge challenge. We conducted a cross-sectional study by an online survey to analyse the variation of practices across blood centers of India during this pandemic. A total of 196 blood centers completely responded to the online survey. Most of the blood centres who responded were part of Government hospitals (60 %), part of an academic institutes (55.6 %) and were directly supporting a COVID hospital (67.5 %). Almost 95.4 % blood centers reported reduction of blood donation mainly due to lockdown (50 %) and inability to conduct camps (17.3 %). Scheduling blood donations was one of the most difficult to implement strategy for maintaining adequate blood donation (40.2 %). Blood center manpower management was also a challenge and upto 48 % blood centers operated in two batches to ensure social distancing in blood banks and reduce the risk of exposure. Hemato-oncology (36.8 %) and obstetrics (33.7 %) were major utilizer of blood during the pandemic. There were marked variations in use of PPE by blood banks staff as well as strategies adopted while conducting immunohematology tests on COVID-19 positive patients samples. This pandemic has highlighted some of the major limitations of the health services but blood services have risen to the challenge and strived to maintain the blood supply chain while ensuring blood donor and staff safety. The wide variations in the practices adopted highlights the need for uniform guidelines for blood services in future pandemics.","Basavarajegowda, Abhishekh; Bajpai, Meenu; Arora, Satyam; Maheshwari, Ashish; Dua, Seema; Sahoo, Dibyajyoti",Transfus Apher Sci,407,16

However, the risk factors for such bacterial coinfection are hitherto unknown. A case-control study was conducted to determine risk factors for bacterial infection in moderate to critical COVID-19. Out of a total of 50 cases and 50 controls, the proportion of cases with severe/critical disease at presentation was 80% in cases compared to 30% in controls (p < 0.001). The predominant site was hospital-acquired pneumonia (72%) and the majority were Gram-negative organisms (82%). The overall mortality was 30%, with comparatively higher mortality among cases (42% vs. 18%; p = 0.009). There was no difference between procalcitonin levels in both groups (p = 0.883). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, significant independent association was found with severe/critical COVID-19 at presentation (AOR: 4.42 times; 95% CI: 1.63-11.9) and use of steroids (AOR: 4.60; 95% CI: 1.24-17.05). Notably, 64% of controls were administered antibiotics despite the absence of bacterial coinfection or secondary infection.

Much of what we know about the signaling molecules and associated signal transduction induced during the host cellular response to viral pathogens has been gained from research conducted from the 1990's to the present day, but certain intricacies of the mechanisms involved, still remain unclear. In a recent study by Vaughn et al. the authors examine one of the main mechanisms regulating interferon induction following viral infection, the RIG-I/MAVS/IRF3 pathway, and find that similar to PKR both DICER interacting proteins, PACT and TRBP, regulate RIG-I signaling in an opposing manner. More specifically, the reported findings demonstrate, like others, that PACT stimulates RIG-I-mediated signaling in a manner independent of PACT dsRNA-binding ability or phosphorylation at sites known to be important for PACT-dependent PKR activation. In contrast, they show for the first time that TRBP inhibits RIG-I-mediated signaling. RIG-I inhibition by TRBP did not require phosphorylation of sites shown to be important for inhibiting PKR, nor did it involve PACT or PKR, but it did require the dsRNA-binding ability of TRBP. These findings open the door to a complex co-regulation of RIG-I, PKR, MDA5, miRNA processing, and interferon induction.","Blalock, William L",Biochem J,407,16

Objective: To determine whether symptoms and laboratory results on the first day of COVID-19 diagnosis are associated with development of a case cluster in a congregant setting. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study of trainees with COVID-19 from May 11 through August 24, 2020, was conducted at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, the primary site of entry for enlistment in the US Air Force. Symptoms and duration, known contacts, and cycle threshold for trainees diagnosed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were collected. A cycle threshold value represents the number of nucleic acid amplification cycles that occur before a specimen containing the target material generates a signal greater than the predetermined threshold that defines positivity. Cohorts with 5 or more individuals with COVID-19 infection were defined as clusters. Participants included 10â¯613 trainees divided into 263 parallel cohorts of 30 to 50 people arriving weekly for 7 weeks of training. Exposures: All trainees were quarantined for 14 days on arrival. Testing was performed on arrival, on day 14, and anytime during training when indicated. Protective measures included universal masking, physical distancing, and rapid isolation of trainees with COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Association between days of symptoms, specific symptoms, number of symptoms, or cycle threshold values of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and subsequent transmission within cohorts. Results: In this cohort study of 10â¯613 US Air Force basic trainees in 263 cohorts, 403 trainees (3%) received a diagnosis of COVID-19 in 129 cohorts (49%). Among trainees with COVID-19 infection, 318 (79%) were men, and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 20 (19-23) years; 204 (51%) were symptomatic, and 199 (49%) were asymptomatic. Median (IQR) cycle threshold values were lower in symptomatic trainees compared with asymptomatic trainees (21.2 [18.4-27.60] vs 34.8 [29.3-37.4]; P < .001). Cohorts with clusters of individuals with COVID-19 infection were predominantly men (204 cohorts [89%] vs 114 cohorts [64%]; P < .001), had more symptomatic trainees (146 cohorts [64%] vs 53 cohorts [30%]; P < .001), and had more median (IQR) symptoms per patient (3 [2-5] vs 1 [1-2]; P < .001) compared with cohorts without clusters. Within cohorts, subsequent development of clusters of 5 or more individuals with COVID-19 infection compared with those that did not develop clusters was associated with cohorts that had more symptomatic trainees (31 of 58 trainees [53%] vs 43 of 151 trainees [28%]; P = .001) and lower median (IQR) cycle threshold values (22.3 [18.4-27.3] vs 35.3 [26.5-37.8]; P < .001).

Within the international project COVID19-NMR, we distribute the spectroscopic analysis of the viral proteins and RNA. Here, we report NMR chemical shift assignments for the protein Nsp3b, a domain of Nsp3. The 217-kDa large Nsp3 protein contains multiple structurally independent, yet functionally related domains including the viral papain-like protease and Nsp3b, a macrodomain (MD). In general, the MDs of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were suggested to play a key role in viral replication by modulating the immune response of the host. The MDs are structurally conserved. They most likely remove ADP-ribose, a common posttranslational modification, from protein side chains. This de-ADP ribosylating function has potentially evolved to protect the virus from the anti-viral ADP-ribosylation catalyzed by poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs), which in turn are triggered by pathogen-associated sensing of the host immune system. This renders the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3b a highly relevant drug target in the viral replication process. We here report the near-complete NMR backbone resonance assignment (1H, 13C, 15N) of the putative Nsp3b MD in its apo form and in complex with ADP-ribose. Furthermore, we derive the secondary structure of Nsp3b in solution. In addition, 15N-relaxation data suggest an ordered, rigid core of the MD structure. These data will provide a basis for NMR investigations targeted at obtaining small-molecule inhibitors interfering with the catalytic activity of Nsp3b.","Cantini, F; Banci, L; Altincekic, N; Bains, J K; Dhamotharan, K; Fuks, C; Fürtig, B; Gande, S L; Hargittay, B; Hengesbach, M; Hutchison, M T; Korn, S M; Kubatova, N; Kutz, F; Linhard, V; Löhr, F; Meiser, N; Pyper, D J; Qureshi, N S; Richter, C; Saxena, K; Schlundt, A; Schwalbe, H; Sreeramulu, S; Tants, J-N; Wacker, A; Weigand, J E; Wöhnert, J; Tsika, A C; Fourkiotis, N K; Spyroulias, G A",Biomol NMR Assign,407,1

Since then, China has experienced a pandemic of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to present the context in which the pandemic has evolved, the government's response and the pandemic's impact on public health and national economy. METHODS: A review was conducted to collect relevant data from press releases and government reports. RESULTS: COVID-19 posed a major public health threat on China with a cumulative number of cases over 89,000 (data cut-off date: August 9th, 2020). Between January and February 2020, China implemented a series of escalating policies (including a stringent nation-wide lockdown) to combat the pandemic. Therefore, it has been to a large extent limited to the Wuhan region. Social media such as WeChat and SinaWeibo played a crucial role in disseminating government information and public campaigns during the pandemic. Technologies were adopted to enable contact tracing and population travel patterns. The Chinese central government mobilized healthcare resources including healthcare personnel and medical materials to Wuhan in a highly effective way. Both central and regional governments launched financial policies to stimulate the economy, including special loans, tax extension, reduction or waiver. Nevertheless, the economy in China was significantly impacted especially during the lockdown period. CONCLUSIONS: China has responded to the COVID-19 epidemic in a highly centralized and effective way. Balancing the needs to prevent a future pandemic and to boost economic recovery remains a challenge.","Xu, Weiwei; Wu, Jing; Cao, Lidan",,407,16

Preliminary evidence as of July 2020 supports a more optimistic assessment. To date, most low- and middle-income countries have a significantly lower death toll per capita than richer countries, a pattern that can be partially explained by younger populations and limited obesity. On the economic front, emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) have seen massive capital outflows and large price declines for certain commodities, especially oil and nonprecious metals, but net capital outflows are in line with earlier commodity price shocks. While there is considerable heterogeneity in how specific countries will be affected in the short and medium run, we are cautiously optimistic that financial markets in the largest EMDEs, especially those not reliant on energy and metal exports, could recover quickly-assuming the disease burden is ultimately not as dire in these countries. In the long run, the highest costs may be due to the indirect effects of virus containment policies on poverty, health, and education as well as the effects of accelerating deglobalization on EMDEs. An important caveat is that there is still considerable uncertainty about the future course of the pandemic and the consequences of new waves of infections.","Goldberg, P.

Vaccination against SARS-COV-2 holds promise for reduction in COVID-19. This operational analysis describes the proportion of SARS-COV-2 positive tests before, during, and after vaccination. DESIGN: Retrospective longitudinal cohort analysis from October 1, 2020 until February 14, 2021. SETTING: A total of 130 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Community Living Centers (CLC), analogous to nursing homes. INTERVENTION: Vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. MEASUREMENTS: The primary measure is the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests among CLC residents. In a pooled analysis of weekly testing and vaccine data, the proportion of positive tests was compared for the unvaccinated, first dose, and second dose. For each CLC, we identified the week in which 50% of CLC residents were vaccinated (index week). The analysis aligned the index week for CLCs and examined the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests at the CLC level before and after. As a reference, we plotted the proportion of positive tests in nursing homes in the same county as the CLC using publicly reported data. RESULTS: Within the pooled VA CLCs, the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose was delivered to 50% of CLC residents within 1 week of availability and second dose within 5 weeks. Relative to the index week, the risk ratio of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests in the vaccinated relative to unvaccinated was significantly lower in Week 4 (relative risk 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.68). Throughout the study period, the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests in community nursing homes was higher compared to VA CLC and also declined after vaccine availability. CONCLUSION: The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests significantly declined in VA CLCs 4 weeks after vaccine delivery and continued to decline in vaccinated and unvaccinated residents. The results describe the importance of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and vaccination in VA nursing home residents.","Rudolph, James L; Hartronft, Scotte; McConeghy, Kevin; Kennedy, Michael; Intrator, Orna; Minor, Lisa; Hubert, Terrence L; Goldstein, Mary K",J. am. geriatr. soc,407,32

In this work, we utilize a single Skip-gram model trained on a multilingual corpus yielding polyglot word embeddings, and present a novel finding that a surprisingly simple constrained nearest-neighbor sampling technique in this embedding space can retrieve bilingual lexicons, even in harsh social media data sets predominantly written in English and Romanized Hindi and often exhibiting code switching. Our method does not require monolingual corpora, seed lexicons, or any other such resources. Additionally, across three European language pairs, we observe that polyglot word embeddings indeed learn a rich semantic representation of words and substantial bilingual lexicons can be retrieved using our constrained nearest neighbor sampling. We investigate potential reasons and downstream applications in settings spanning both clean texts and noisy social media data sets, and in both resource-rich and under-resourced language pairs.","KhudaBukhsh, Ashiqur R.; Palakodety, Shriphani; Mitchell, Tom M.",,407,16

While a connection between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and hyperglycemia/insulin deficiency is well described, its direct relation to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is not. In this study we describe trends in ED volume and admitted patient diagnoses of DKA among five of our health system's EDs, as they relate to peak SARS-CoV-2 activity in New York City. METHODS: For the five EDs in our hospital system, deidentified visit data extracted for routine quality review was made available for analysis. We looked at total visits and select visit diagnoses related to DKA, across the months of March, April and May 2019, and compared those counts to the same period in 2020. RESULTS: A total of 93,218 visits were recorded across our five EDs from March 1-May 31, 2019. During that period there were 106 diagnoses of DKA made in the EDs (0.114% of visits). Across the same period in 2020 there were 59,009 visits, and 214 diagnoses of DKA (0.363% of visits) CONCLUSION: Despite a decrease in ED volume of 26.9% across our system during this time period, net cases of DKA diagnoses rose drastically by 70.1% compared to the prior year.","Ditkowsky, Jared; Lieber, Adam C; Leibner, Evan S; Genes, Nicholas",West J Emerg Med,407,1

However, it turns out that a reduction in the actual daily new infection rate (actual daily growth rate of reported cases, in short: infection rate) from the current value of 30-35% in the US to 10% would be extremely effective in stopping the spread of the virus. The severe restrictions in Germany which closed any public events, schools and universities a week ago might already have contributed to a reduction of the growth rate of reported cases below 30%.","Schmitt, Franz-Josef",,407,1

Both these sarbecoviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, engage ACE2 via the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD)2-6. However, binding to ACE2 orthologs from humans, bats, and other species has been observed only sporadically among the broader diversity of bat sarbecoviruses7-11. Here, we use high-throughput assays12 to trace the evolutionary history of ACE2 binding across a diverse range of sarbecoviruses and ACE2 orthologs. We find that ACE2 binding is an ancestral trait of sarbecovirus RBDs that has subsequently been lost in some clades. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that bat sarbecoviruses from outside Asia can bind ACE2. In addition, ACE2 binding is highly evolvable: for many sarbecovirus RBDs there are single amino-acid mutations that enable binding to new ACE2 orthologs. However, the effects of individual mutations can differ markedly between viruses, as illustrated by the N501Y mutation which enhances human ACE2 binding affinity within several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern12 but severely dampens it for SARS-CoV-1. Our results point to the deep ancestral origin and evolutionary plasticity of ACE2 binding, broadening consideration of the range of sarbecoviruses with spillover potential.","Starr, Tyler N; Zepeda, Samantha K; Walls, Alexandra C; Greaney, Allison J; Veesler, David; Bloom, Jesse D",,407,27

Gallium maltolate (GaM), a small metal-organic coordination complex, has been tested in several Phase 1 clinical trials, in which no dose-limiting or other serious toxicity was reported, even at high daily oral doses for several months at a time. For these reasons, GaM may be considered a potential candidate to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and can result in severe, sometimes lethal, inflammatory reactions. In this study, we assessed the ability of GaM to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in a culture of Vero E6 cells. METHODS: The efficacy of GaM in inhibiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 was determined in a screening assay using cultured Vero E6 cells. The cytotoxicity of GaM in uninfected cells was determined using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) colorimetric assay. RESULTS: The results showed that GaM inhibits viral replication in a dose-dependent manner, with the concentration that inhibits replication by 50% (EC50) being about 14 µM. No cytotoxicity was observed at concentrations up to at least 200 µM. CONCLUSION: The in vitro activity of GaM against SARS-CoV-2, together with GaM's known anti-inflammatory activity, provide justification for testing GaM in COVID-19 patients.","Bernstein, Lawrence R; Zhang, Leike",Antivir Chem Chemother,407,1

Using the calibrated model, we estimate that mobility restrictions contribute to 47 % (US States) and 47 % (worldwide) of the overall suppression of the disease transmission rate using data up to 13/08/2020. The forecast capacity of our model was evaluated doing four-weeks ahead predictions. Using data up to 30/06/20 for calibration, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the prediction of cumulative deceased individuals was 5.0 % for the United States (51 states) and 6.7 % worldwide (49 countries). This MAPE was reduced to 3.5% for the US and 3.8% worldwide using data up to 13/08/2020. We find that the MAPE was higher for the total confirmed cases at 11.5% worldwide and 10.2% for the US States using data up to 13/08/2020. Our calibrated model achieves an average R-Squared value for cumulative confirmed and deceased cases of 0.992 using data up to 30/06/20 and 0.98 using data up to 13/08/20.","Diaz, Victor Hugo Grisales; Prado-Rubio, Oscar Andres; Willis, Mark J.",,407,33

For this purpose, they offer, among other things, a structured seminar program for post-graduate trainees in general practice (GP-trainees). During the Covid-19 pandemic the seminar program of the KWBW-Verbundweiterbildungplus® in Baden-Württemberg was converted to digital formats. The goal of the paper is to evaluate the acceptance by the GP-trainees and lecturers, to describe experiences with the conversion to e-learning and to derive recommendations with regard to the future orientation of seminar programs in post-graduate as well as continuing medical education. The implementation was based on a modified Kern-cycle and aimed at offering eight teaching units of 45 minutes each to a large number of GP-trainees. It tried to maintain the high quality of content and education as well as the interactive character of the previous seminars. For this purpose, the events were designed as synchronous webinars (six units) with asynchronous preparation and post-processing (two units) according to the flipped classroom method. The evaluation by the participating GP-trainees and lecturers was performed online using a multi-center developed and pre-piloted questionnaire. Results and discussion: N=101 GP-trainees participated in the evaluation of five individual seminar days in the second quarter of 2020 (response rate 97%). 58% (N=59) of the trainees were satisfied or very satisfied with the implementation. 82% (n=83) rated pre-tasks as helpful. 99% (n=100) would participate in an online seminar again. For 52% (n=53) of the trainees, the attitude towards e-learning had changed positively. The main advantages mentioned were no travel, save in time and costs as well as increased flexibility. The main disadvantages mentioned were less personal interaction and technical obstacles. The high acceptance of the new digital format showed the fundamental potential of e-learning in continuing medical education. The experiences can be a source of inspiration for other departments and KW. However, it also shows that important goals of KW, such as the personal interaction of the peer group, could not be achieved. In the future, it is important to develop a suitable mix of presence and digital formats with the aim to improve the attractiveness as well as sustainability of continuing medical education.","Förster, Christian; Eismann-Schweimler, Jessica; Stengel, Sandra; Bischoff, Martina; Fuchs, Monika; Graf von Luckner, Andreas; Ledig, Thomas; Barzel, Anne; Maun, Andy; Joos, Stefanie; Szecsenyi, Joachim; Schwill, Simon",GMS J Med Educ,407,16

The present study aimed to carry out a health impact assessment in Recife, Brazil, hypothesizing a scenario in which the levels of PM10 and PM2.5 remained, throughout the year, as in the most restrictive period of human mobility. Particular material data (PM10 and PM2.5) were measured during the pandemic and population and health (mortality, hospital admissions for heart and respiratory problems) data from 2018 were used. We observed a reduction in the concentration of PM2.5 in up to 43.7% and PM10 up to 29.5% during the period of social isolation in the city of Recife. The reduction in PM2.5 would avoid 106 annual deaths from non-external causes and 58 annual deaths from cardiovascular diseases. In this scenario, $ 294.88 million would be saved ($ 114.88 million from heart problems and $ 180 million from non-external causes). When considering hospitalizations avoided by the decrease in PM10, we observed 57 fewer hospitalizations for respiratory diseases, 42 for heart diseases and a reduction of 37 deaths due to non-external causes. The reduction in spending on respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations would exceed $ 330,000. Therefore, the reduction of particulate matter could prevent hospital admissions, deaths and consequently there would be a reduction in disease burden in developing countries where economic resources are scarce. In this sense, governments should seek to reduce levels of pollution in order to improve the life quality and health of the population.","Leão, Marcos Lorran Paranhos; Penteado, Julia Oliveira; Ulguim, Sabrina Morales; Gabriel, Rômulo Reginato; Dos Santos, Marina; Brum, Aline Neutzling; Zhang, Linjie; da Silva Júnior, Flavio Manoel Rodrigues",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

The aim of this study is the validation and application of a web-survey, addressed to nursing students and nurses, in order to evaluate the degree of accuracy and the knowledge on the correct positioning of the 12-leads ECG. METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study. The survey comprised 30 items, mainly multiple-choice questions. The participants were 484 nurses and nursing students. In the study, no exclusion criteria were adopted, but fill in the questionnaire any nurse on duty during the data collection period and/or any nursing student during the data collection period. Statistical analyses were performed using the SAS v. 9.4. In the study, no exclusion criteria were adopted. RESULTS: A total of 484 nursing students and nurses comprising of 149 males (30.79%) and 335 females (69.21%) responded. In full findings showed good psychometric properties and good reliability. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the study is 0.76 (number of items = 17, number of obs= 484). The mean age of responders was 32.01 (Standard deviation (SD) 9.63).

Unfortunately, these ASGM activities lacked adequate tailings management strategies, so contamination of the environment is prevalent. In this study, soil contamination with copper (Cu), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn) and arsenic (As) due to ASGM activities in Nabunturan, Davao de Oro, Philippines was investigated. The results showed that ASGM-impacted soils had Cu, Pb, Zn and As up to 3.6, 83, 73 and 68 times higher than background levels, respectively and were classified as 'extremely' polluted (CD = 30-228; PLI = 5.5-34.8). Minerals typically found in porphyry copper-gold ores like pyrite, chalcopyrite, malachite, galena, sphalerite and goethite were identified by XRD and SEM-EDS analyses. Furthermore, sequential extraction results indicate substantial Cu (up to 90%), Pb (up to 50%), Zn (up to 65%) and As (up to 48%) partitioned with strongly adsorbed, weak acid soluble, reducible and oxidisable fractions, which are considered as 'geochemically mobile' phases in the environment. Although very high Pb and Zn were found in ASGM-impacted soils, they were relatively immobile under oxidising conditions around pH 8.5 because of their retention via adsorption to hydrous ferric oxides (HFOs), montmorillonite and kaolinite. In contrast, Cu and As release from the historic ASGM site samples exceeded the environmental limits for Class A and Class C effluents, which could be attributed to the removal of calcite and dolomite by weathering. The enhanced desorption of As at around pH 8.5 also likely contributed to its release from these soils.","Tabelin, Carlito Baltazar; Silwamba, Marthias; Paglinawan, Florifern C; Mondejar, Alissa Jane S; Duc, Ho Gia; Resabal, Vannie Joy; Opiso, Einstine M; Igarashi, Toshifumi; Tomiyama, Shingo; Ito, Mayumi; Hiroyoshi, Naoki; Villacorte-Tabelin, Mylah",Chemosphere,407,16

In this study, we report a new class of nanofiber swabs tipped with hierarchical 3D nanofiber objects produced by expanding electrospun membranes with a solids-of-revolution-inspired gas foaming technique. Nanofiber swabs significantly improve absorption and release of proteins, cells, bacteria, DNA, and viruses from solutions and surfaces. Implementation of nanofiber swabs in SARS-CoV-2 detection reduces the false negative rates at two viral concentrations and identifies SARS-CoV-2 at a 10× lower viral concentration compared to flocked and cotton swabs. The nanofiber swabs show great promise in improving test sensitivity, potentially leading to timely and accurate diagnosis of many diseases.","McCarthy, Alec; Saldana, Lorenzo; Ackerman, Daniel N; Su, Yajuan; John, Johnson V; Chen, Shixuan; Weihs, Shelbie; Reid, St Patrick; Santarpia, Joshua L; Carlson, Mark A; Xie, Jingwei",Nano Lett,407,16

However, little is known about the magnitude of these psychological effects on a population level and for vulnerable subgroups. METHODS: A representative sample (N = 2503; 50.2% female; mean age = 49.5) of the German population was assessed face-to-face during the COVID-19 pandemic (February 10-April 25, 2020). They were examined for differences in mental health (BSI-18) and relationship quality (PFB) in a pre-lockdown and lockdown subsamples. After testing and establishing the measurement models in confirmatory factor analyses, we added covariates as predictors of the factors to the regression model to investigate the impact of the lockdown measures. RESULTS: Overall, participants included after the introduction of lockdown measures reported significantly fewer mental health problems than participants included before the lockdown. Predictor analyses revealed that this effect was larger for participants of younger age and those with higher household income. There was no significant difference in relationship quality between pre-lockdown and lockdown. However, relationship quality improved for younger participants after the lockdown measures started, but deteriorated for older participants. CONCLUSIONS: The German population was found to be largely resilient to the immediate effects of lockdown on mental health and relationship quality. Older participants and those with lower socio-economic status might constitute risk groups during times of lockdown. Further studies in countries affected by more drastic lockdown measures and the long-term consequences of the pandemic are needed to inform decision makers about the psychological effects of lockdown.","Sachser, Cedric; Olaru, Gabriel; Pfeiffer, Elisa; Brähler, Elmar; Clemens, Vera; Rassenhofer, Miriam; Witt, Andreas; Fegert, Jörg M",Soc Sci Med,407,20

While many surveys have been conducted, most are focused on drinking changes in the general population and validation with biological markers is lacking. METHOD: We performed a retrospective cohort study among patients with AUD attending a urine drug screening program. With mixed-effects logistic regression models, we assessed the probability of screening positive for ethyl glucuronide according to patients' main clinical characteristics and time of analysis (either prior to or after a lockdown was implemented in Spain). RESULTS: A total of 362 patients provided 2,040 urine samples (1,295 prior to lockdown, 745 during lockdown). The mean age of participants was 52.0 years (SD 12.6), and 69.2% were men. Of the 43% of patients tested for other drugs 22% screened positive. After adjusting for all covariates, the odds of screening positive for ethyl glucuronide during lockdown almost doubled (OR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.33, p = 0.008).

CONCLUSIONS: Our data support an association between the lockdown due to COVID-19 and increased alcohol use in patients with AUD.

The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the impact of the lockdown secondary to the pandemic on patient numbers and pattern of injuries at the department of traumatology of the Medical University of Vienna. METHODS: This retrospective, descriptive study identified all patients admitted and enrolled onto the trauma registry at a level I trauma center, between 15 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 (lockdown) and compared them to those between 15 March 2019 and 30 April 2019 (baseline). Variables collected included patient age, sex, reason for hospital admission, place of injury, death, injury severity score (ISS), as well as American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score. RESULTS: A total of 10,938 patient visits to the trauma emergency department were analyzed, 8353 presentations during the baseline period and 2585 during lockdown. Only 1869 acutely injured and 716 follow-up patients presented during lockdown, compared to 6178 and 2175, respectively, during baseline. Throughout the COVID-19 lockdown there were significant reductions in both workplace and traffic accidents, sports injuries, number of hospitalized patients, and overall visits to the trauma emergency department; however, the number of major traumas and hip fractures remained similar. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the frequency of injuries at home as well as hospital admissions due to attempted suicide. CONCLUSION: Despite the reduction in total number of patients, trauma departments should continue to provide adequate service during lockdown considering that severe injuries showed no change. Conditions such as breakdown of social networks and limited access to mental health care and support might account for the significant rise in hospital admissions due to suicides. We recommend that more attention and effort should be made to prevent this excess of suicide deaths.","Nia, Arastoo; Popp, Domenik; Diendorfer, Cornelia; Apprich, Sebastian; Munteanu, Alexandru; Hajdu, Stefan; Widhalm, Harald K",Wien Klin Wochenschr,407,9

Guidelines for tracheotomy in this cohort of patients are therefore required with assessed outcomes of tracheotomies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheotomy. Inclusion criteria were the performance of a tracheotomy in COVID-19 positive patients between March 11 and December 31, 2020. Exclusion criteria were lack of consent, extubation prior to the performance of a tracheotomy, death prior to the performance of the tracheotomy, and COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheotomy who tested negative twice after medical treatment. The primary predictor variable was the performance of a tracheotomy in COVID-19 positive patients and the primary outcome variable was the time to cessation of mechanical ventilation with the institution of supplemental oxygen via trach mask. RESULTS: Seventeen tracheotomies were performed between 4-25 days following intubation (meanâ¯=â¯17 days). Seven patients died between 4 and 16 days (meanâ¯=â¯8.7 days) following tracheotomy and 10 living patients realized cessation of mechanical ventilation from 4 hours to 61 days following tracheotomy (meanâ¯=â¯19.3 days). These patients underwent tracheotomy between 4 and 22 days following intubation (meanâ¯=â¯14 days). The 7 patients who died following tracheotomy underwent the procedure between 7 and 25 days following intubation (meanâ¯=â¯18.2 days). Seven patients underwent tracheotomy on or after 20 days of intubation and 3 survived (43%). Ten patients underwent tracheotomy before 20 days of intubation and 7 patients survived (70%). Significant differences between the mortality groups were detected for age (Pâ¯=â¯.006), and for P/F ratio at time of consult (Pâ¯=â¯.047) and the time of tracheotomy (Pâ¯=â¯.03). CONCLUSIONS: Tracheotomies are safely performed in COVID-19 patients with a standardized protocol. The timing of tracheotomy in COVID-19 patients is based on ventilator parameters, P/F ratio, patient prognosis, patient advanced directives, and family wishes.","Carlson, Eric R; Heidel, R Eric; Houston, Kyle; Vahdani, Soheil; Winstead, Michael",J. oral maxillofac. surg,407,24

The outcome of interest for this study was the composite poor outcome, which comprises mortality, acute respiratory distress syndrome, need for care in an intensive care unit, and severe COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 5350 patients were pooled from 25 studies. Elevated CRP was associated with an increased composite poor outcome [risk ratio (RR) 1.84 (1.45, 2.33), p < 0.001; I2: 96%] and its severe COVID-19 (RR 1.41; I2: 93%) subgroup. A CRP â©¾10 mg/L has a 51% sensitivity, 88% specificity, likelihood ratio (LR) + of 4.1, LR- of 0.5, and an area under curve (AUC) of 0.84. An elevated PCT was associated with an increased composite poor outcome [RR 3.92 (2.42, 6.35), p < 0.001; I2: 85%] and its mortality (RR 6.26; I2: 96%) and severe COVID-19 (RR 3.93; I2: 63%) subgroups. A PCT â©¾0.5 ng/ml has an 88% sensitivity, 68% specificity, LR+ of 2.7, LR- of 0.2, and an AUC of 0.88. An elevated D-dimer was associated with an increased composite poor outcome [RR 2.93 (2.14, 4.01), p < 0.001; I2: 77%], including its mortality (RR 4.15; I2: 83%) and severe COVID-19 (RR 2.42; I2: 58%) subgroups. A D-dimer >0.5 mg/L has a 58% sensitivity, 69% specificity, LR+ of 1.8, LR- of 0.6, and an AUC of 0.69. Patients with a composite poor outcome had a higher serum ferritin with a standardized mean difference of 0.90 (0.64, 1.15), p < 0.0001; I2: 76%. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis showed that an elevated serum CRP, PCT, D-dimer, and ferritin were associated with a poor outcome in COVID-19.

Although experts began to recognize it as a public health crisis prior to 2020, the novel coronavirus pandemic has accelerated recognition of social isolation as a serious threat to health and well-being. OBJECTIVE: Examine patient experiences with screening and assistance for social isolation in primary care settings, and whether patient experiences with these activities are associated with the severity of reported social isolation. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey conducted in 2018. PARTICIPANTS: Adults (N = 251) were recruited from 3 primary care clinics in Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco. MAIN MEASURES: A modified version of the Berkman-Syme Social Network Index (SNI), endorsed by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine; items to assess for prior experiences with screening and assistance for social isolation. KEY RESULTS: In the sample population, 12.4% reported the highest levels of social isolation (SNI = 0/1), compared to 36.7%, 34.7%, and 16.3% (SNI = 2-4, respectively). Most patients had not been asked about social isolation in a healthcare setting (87.3%), despite reporting no discomfort with social isolation screening (93.9%). Neither discomfort with nor participation in prior screening for social isolation was associated with social isolation levels. Desire for assistance with social isolation (3.2%) was associated with a higher level of social isolation (AOR = 6.0, 95% CI, 1.3-28.8), as well as poor or fair health status (AOR = 9.1; 95% CI, 1.3-64.1). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, few patients reported being screened previously for social isolation in a primary care setting, despite low levels of discomfort with screening. Providers should consider broadening social isolation screening and referral practices in healthcare settings, especially among sicker and more isolated patients who express higher levels of interest in assistance with social isolation.","Tung, Elizabeth L; De Marchis, Emilia H; Gottlieb, Laura M; Lindau, Stacy Tessler; Pantell, Matthew S",J. gen. intern. med,407,10

The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to be transmitted via respiratory droplets from asymptomatic individuals has necessitated increased usage of both N95 respirators in the healthcare setting and masks (both surgical and homemade) in public spaces. These precautions rely on two fundamental principles of transmission prevention: particle filtration and droplet containment. The former is the focus of NIOSH N95 testing guidelines, and the latter is an FDA guideline for respirators and surgical masks. While studies have investigated droplet containment to provide guidance for homemade mask production, limited work has been done to characterize the filtration efficiency (FE) of materials used in home mask making. In this work, we demonstrate the low-cost (<$300) conversion of standard equipment used to fit-test respirators in hospital and industrial settings into a setup that measures quantitative FEs of materials based on NIOSH N95 guidelines, and subsequently measure FEs of materials found in healthcare and consumer spaces. These materials demonstrate significant variability in filtration characteristics, even for visually similar materials. We demonstrate a FE of 96.49% and pressure drop of 25.4 mmH20 for a double-layer of sterilization wrap used in surgical suites and a FE of 90.37% for a combination of consumer-grade materials. The excellent filtration characteristics of the former demonstrate potential utility for emergent situations when N95 respirators are not available, while those of the latter demonstrate that a high FE can be achieved using publicly available materials.","Long, Kenneth D; Woodburn, Elizabeth V; Berg, Ian C; Chen, Valerie; Scott, William S",PLoS One,407,33

For instance, the genetic homology of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is 80% and 50%, respectively, which may cause similar clinical features. Moreover, uncontrolled release of proinflammatory mediators (also called a cytokine storm) by activated immune cells in SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 patients leads to severe phenotype development. Aim: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the inflammatory cytokine profile associated with three strains of severe human coronavirus diseases (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2). Method: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies published until July 2020. Randomized and observational studies reporting the inflammatory cytokines associated with severe and non-severe human coronavirus diseases, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, were included. Two reviewers independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the included studies. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model with a 95% confidence interval to estimate the pooled mean of inflammatory biomarkers. Results: A high level of circulating IL-6 could be associated with the severity of infection of the three coronavirus strains. TNF, IL-10, and IL-8 are associated with the severity of COVID-19. Increased circulating levels of CXCL10/IP10 and CCL2/MCP-1 might also be related to the severity of MERS. Conclusion: This study suggests that the immune response and immunopathology in the three severe human coronavirus strains are somewhat similar. The findings highlight that nearly all studies reporting severe cases of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 have been associated with elevated levels of IL-6. This could be used as a potential therapeutic target to improve patients' outcomes in severe cases.

We aimed to study predictors of in-hospital death, characteristics of arrhythmias and the effects of QT-prolonging therapy in patients with cardiac injury. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving patients with severe COVID-19 who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, between Jan. 29 and Mar. 8, 2020. Among patients who had cardiac injury, which we defined as an elevated level of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), we identified demographic and clinical characteristics associated with mortality and need for invasive ventilation. RESULTS: Among 1284 patients with severe COVID-19, 1159 had a cTnI level measured on admission to hospital, of whom 170 (14.7%) had results that showed cardiac injury. We found that mortality was markedly higher in patients with cardiac injury (71.2% v. 6.6%, p < 0.001). We determined that initial cTnI (per 10-fold increase, hazard ratio [HR] 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.66) and peak cTnI level during illness (per 10-fold increase, HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.38-2.10) were associated with poor survival. Peak cTnI was also associated with the need for invasive ventilation (odds ratio 3.02, 95% CI 1.92-4.98). We found arrhythmias in 44 of the 170 patients with cardiac injury (25.9%), including 6 patients with ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, all of whom died. We determined that patients who received QT-prolonging drugs had longer QTc intervals than those who did not receive them (difference in medians, 45 ms, p = 0.01), but such treatment was not independently associated with mortality (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.69-1.57). INTERPRETATION: We found that in patients with COVID-19 and cardiac injury, initial and peak cTnI levels were associated with poor survival, and peak cTnI was a predictor of need for invasive ventilation. Patients with COVID-19 warrant assessment for cardiac injury and monitoring, especially if therapy that can prolong repolarization is started.

Alternatives to in-office outpatient medical evaluations are necessary. We aimed to analyze how quickly orthopedic surgery providers at a large academic institution adopted telemedicine, and identify any factors that were associated with earlier or ""faster"" telemedicine adoption. Methods: We analyzed the telemedicine activity of 39 providers within the Department of Orthopedic Surgery between March 16, 2020, and May 30, 2020, and constructed logistic regression models to identify characteristics with significant association to earlier or faster telemedicine adoption. Results: No significant predictors of percentage of visits conducted via telemedicine were found. However, increased experience and practice at multiple locations was associated with slower telemedicine adoption time, while Professor level academic rank was associated with a faster time to achieving 10% of pre-COVID visit volumes via telemedicine. Higher pre-COVID visit volumes were also significantly associated with faster telemedicine adoption. Demographic factors, including, age, gender, practice locations, academic degrees, pediatric specialty, and use of physician assistants/nurse practitioners, were not found to have significant associations with telemedicine use. Conclusions: These results indicate that telemedicine has an important role to play within academic orthopedic surgery practices, with a wide and diverse range of orthopedic surgery providers choosing to utilize it during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the rapid expansion and urgency driving the adoption of telemedicine, these results illustrate the importance of considering provider-side characteristics in ensuring that providers are well equipped to utilize telemedicine.","Annapragada, Akshaya V; Jenkins, Sabrina G; Chang, Annika L; Jain, Amit; Srikumaran, Divya; Srikumaran, Uma",Telemed. j. e. health,407,26

Il est responsable d’infections respiratoires, pouvant mener à un syndrome de détresse respiratoire aigu (SDRA) et au décès. Ce virus s’est rapidement répandu dans le monde. En France, les premiers cas ont été diagnostiqués fin janvier 2020. Un confinement national a été mis en place de mars à avril 2020 pour tenter de contenir l’épidémie. L’objectif de notre étude était de déterminer le poids de la COVID-19 chez les personnes vivant avec le VIH (PVVIH) après la première vague de la pandémie. Matériels et méthodes Nous avons réalisé une enquête épidémiologique du 1er avril au 1er août 2020 dans un centre de référence pour la prise en charge des PVVIH. Lors de leur première visite de suivi après la levée du confinement, les PVVIH ont rempli un questionnaire sur les facteurs d’exposition et les symptômes compatibles avec la COVID-19. Une sérologie SRAS-CoV-2 était prélevée lors de la consultation. La prévalence, l’incidence et les facteurs de risque de la COVID-19 chez les PVVIH ont été déterminés. Résultats Six cent PVVIH ont été inclus. Une infection à SARS-CoV-2 était confirmée chez 16 d’entre eux. Les symptômes compatibles avec la COVID-19 étaient fréquents chez les PVVIH en présence ou non d’une infection confirmée à SARS-CoV-2 (67 % vs 32 %, p=0,02). Parmi les PVVIH ayant présenté une infection à SARS-CoV-2 confirmée, une (6 %) a été hospitalisée, 5 (31 %) sont restées asymptomatiques. Il n’y avait pas de différence concernant l’âge, le sexe, les comorbidités associés, et les variables liées à l’infection par le VIH entre les PVVIH ayant ou non contracté la COVID-19. Seul un contact rapproché avec une personne infectée par le SARS-CoV-2 était associé à l’acquisition de la COVID-19 (40 % vs 13 %, p=0,01). La prévalence de la COVID-19 chez les PVVIH était de 2,5 %, la moitié de celle observée dans la population générale après la première vague de la pandémie en France.

METHODS: We examined the association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death at a large medical center in New York City. Data were obtained regarding consecutive patients hospitalized with Covid-19, excluding those who were intubated, died, or discharged within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department (study baseline). The primary end point was a composite of intubation or death in a time-to-event analysis. We compared outcomes in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with those in patients who did not, using a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score. RESULTS: Of 1446 consecutive patients, 70 patients were intubated, died, or discharged within 24 hours after presentation and were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 1376 patients, during a median follow-up of 22.5 days, 811 (58.9%) received hydroxychloroquine (600 mg twice on day 1, then 400 mg daily for a median of 5 days); 45.8% of the patients were treated within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department, and 85.9% within 48 hours. Hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were more severely ill at baseline than those who did not receive hydroxychloroquine (median ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen, 223 vs. 360). Overall, 346 patients (25.1%) had a primary end-point event (180 patients were intubated, of whom 66 subsequently died, and 166 died without intubation). In the main analysis, there was no significant association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death (hazard ratio, 1.04, 95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.32). Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In this observational study involving patients with Covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital, hydroxychloroquine administration was not associated with either a greatly lowered or an increased risk of the composite end point of intubation or death. Randomized, controlled trials of hydroxychloroquine in patients with Covid-19 are needed.

METHODSWe evaluated iron metabolism and immune response in 303 patients admitted to the main hospital of the northern region of Portugal with variable clinical pictures, from September to November 2020. Of these, 127 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 176 tested negative. Iron-related laboratory parameters and cytokines were determined in blood samples collected soon after admission and, in a subgroup of patients, throughout hospitalization. Demographic data, comorbidities and clinical outcomes were recorded. Patients were assigned into 5 groups according to disease severity. RESULTSSerum iron and transferrin levels at admission were lower in COVID-19-positive than in COVID-19-negative patients. Conversely, the levels of interleukin(IL)-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) were increased in COVID-19-positive patients. The lowest serum iron and transferrin levels at diagnosis were associated with the worst outcomes. Iron levels negatively correlated with IL-6 and higher levels of this cytokine were associated with a worse prognosis. Serum ferritin levels at diagnosis were higher in COVID-19-positive than in COVID-19-negative patients but did not correlate with disease severity. Longitudinal determinations of iron and ferritin made in a subgroup of patients (n=23) revealed highly variable results. CONCLUSIONSSerum iron is the simplest laboratory test to be implemented as a predictor of disease progression in hospitalized acute COVID-19-positive patients. Variation of ferritin with time should be revisited in larger cohorts. Key pointsCOVID-19-positive patients have lower serum iron and higher ferritin than COVID-19-negative patients in variable clinical contexts. Lowest serum iron and highest IL-6 levels at hospital admission associate with the poorest outcomes. Association of serum ferritin with disease progression is debatable.","Moreira, Ana C.; Teles, Maria Jose; Silva, Tania; Bento, Clara M.; Alves, Ines Simoes; Pereira, Luisa C.; Guimaraes, Joao T.; Porto, Graca; Oliveira, Pedro; Gomes, Salome",,407,13

Amidst intersecting crises of COVID-19, racism, and police brutality, this report describes survey development and data collection procedures for the SHUR. BASIC PROCEDURES: We conducted focus groups with Black men, Latinxs, and immigrants in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Findings were used to develop and refine measures of conditions salient to the health of urban residents across the country. Quota sampling was employed; oversampling people of color and persons whose usual source of care was not a doctor's office. MAIN FINDINGS: Non-Hispanic Whites made up just under two thirds of the sample (63.65%, n = 2793). Black/African American respondents accounted for 14.2% of the sample (n = 623), while 11.62% (n = 510) were Latinx. Only 43.46% of respondents reported a doctor's office as their usual source of care. Novel measures of population-specific stressors include a range of negative encounters with the police, frequency of these encounters, and respondents' assessments of whether the encounters were necessary. SHUR assessed the likelihood of calling the police if there is a problem, worries about incarceration, and cause-specific stressors such as race-related impression management. PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS: SHUR (n = 4389) is a useful resource for researchers seeking to address the health implications of experiences not frequently measured by national health surveillance surveys. It includes respondents' zip codes, presenting the opportunity to connect these data with zip code-level health system, social and economic characteristics that shape health beyond individual factors.","Alang, Sirry; Pando, Cynthia; McClain, Malcolm; Batts, Hasshan; Letcher, Abby; Hager, Janelle; Person, Taylor; Shaw, Adama; Blake, Kwamaine; Matthews-Alvarado, Kevelis",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),407,20

Recently, corona viral epidemic raised the issue of developing effective antiviral agents at the earliest to prevent further losses. Natural products have always played a crucial role in drug development process against various diseases, which resulted in screening of such agents to combat emergent mutants of corona virus. This review focuses on those natural compounds that showed promising results against corona viruses. Although inhibition of viral replication is often considered as a general mechanism for antiviral activity of most of the natural products, studies have shown that some natural products can interact with key viral proteins that are associated with virulence. In this context, some of the natural products have antiviral activity in the nanomolar concentration (e.g., lycorine, homoharringtonine, silvestrol, ouabain, tylophorine, and 7-methoxycryptopleurine) and could be leads for further drug development on their own or as a template for drug design. In addition, a good number of natural products with anti-corona virus activity are the major constituents of some common dietary supplements, which can be exploited to improve the immunity of the general population in certain epidemics.","Islam, Muhammad T; Sarkar, Chandan; El-Kersh, Dina M; Jamaddar, Sarmin; Uddin, Shaikh J; Shilpi, Jamil A; Mubarak, Mohammad S",Phytother Res,407,26

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the CT image data of COVID-19 patients diagnosed by nucleic acid test and CT examination in 57 patients in Zhuzhou Central Hospital and Zhuzhou First People's Hospital, and summarized the characteristics of CT imaging and the development of lesions. RESULTS: Most of the cases were characterized by peripheral distribution of lesions. A total of 37 cases (64.91%) were purely peripherally distributed, 16 cases (28.07%) coexisted with peripheral and mid-internal distribution, and 4 cases (7.02%) had simple mid-inner band distribution. In peripherally distributed cases, the long axis of the lesion was mostly parallel to the pleura in 36 cases (63.16%). In the case of inner-middle zone distribution, the long axis of the lesion was mostly parallel and surrounded the bronchial vascular bundle, or distributed along the lung lobules (31.58%). All cases had ground-glass-density foci, 31 cases (54.38%) had fine grid shadows in the lesions, 46 cases (80.70%) had thick vascular shadows in the lesions, and 23 cases (40.35%) showed signs of bronchial inflation.

CONCLUSIONS: The early CT manifestations of COVID-19 are mostly ground-glass-density foci distributed in the subpleural region, some of which are distributed near the bronchial blood vessel bundle and in the central area of the lobule. As the course of the disease progresses, there may be varying degrees of solid components in the lesion.

Infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are increasingly prevalent, but treatment options are limited. While several serine-dependent ß-lactamase inhibitors are formulated with commonly prescribed ß-lactams, no MBL inhibitors are currently approved for combinatorial therapies. New compounds that target MBLs to restore carbapenem activity against CPE are therefore urgently needed. Herein we identified and characterized novel synthetic peptide inhibitors that bound to and inhibited NDM-1, which is an emerging ß-lactam resistance mechanism in CPE. METHODS: We leveraged Surface Localized Antimicrobial displaY (SLAY) to identify and characterize peptides that inhibit NDM-1, which is a primary carbapenem resistance mechanism in CPE. Lead inhibitor sequences were chemically synthesized and MBCs and MICs were calculated in the presence/absence of carbapenems. Kinetic analysis with recombinant NDM-1 and select peptides tested direct binding and supported NDM-1 inhibitor mechanisms of action. Inhibitors were also tested for cytotoxicity. RESULTS: We identified approximately 1700 sequences that potentiated carbapenem-dependent killing against NDM-1 Escherichia coli. Several also enhanced meropenem-dependent killing of other CPE. Biochemical characterization of a subset indicated the peptides penetrated the bacterial periplasm and directly bound NDM-1 to inhibit enzymatic activity. Additionally, each demonstrated minimal haemolysis and cytotoxicity against mammalian cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach advances a molecular platform for antimicrobial discovery, which complements the growing need for alternative antimicrobials. We also discovered lead NDM-1 inhibitors, which serve as a starting point for further chemical optimization.","Kazi, Misha I; Perry, Blair W; Card, Daren C; Schargel, Richard D; Ali, Hana B; Obuekwe, Victor C; Sapkota, Madhab; Kang, Katie N; Pellegrino, Mark W; Greenberg, David E; Castoe, Todd A; Boll, Joseph M",J. antimicrob. chemother,407,33

It is known that N501Y and E484K can enhance binding between the coronavirus receptor domain (RBD) and human ACE2. However, the K417N mutation appears to be unfavorable as it removes one interfacial salt bridge. Here, we show that despite the decrease in binding affinity (1.48 kcal/mol) between RBD and ACE2, the K417N mutation abolishes a buried interfacial salt bridge between the RBD and neutralizing antibody CB6. This substantially reduces their binding energy by 9.59 kcal/mol, thus facilitating the process by which the variant efficiently eludes CB6 (including many other antibodies). Our theoretical predictions agree with existing experimental findings. Harnessing the revealed molecular mechanisms makes it possible to redesign therapeutic antibodies, thus making them more efficacious.","Luan, Binquan; Huynh, Tien",J. med. chem,407,24

We conducted this study to show the different spectral frequency and time domain parameters of HRV as a prospective predictor for critically ill patients, and in particular for COVID-19 patients who are on mechanical ventilation. The hypothesis is that most severely ill COVID-19 patients have a depletion of the sympathetic nervous system and a predominance of parasympathetic activity reflecting the remaining compensatory anti-inflammatory response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center, prospective, observational pilot study which included COVID-19 patients admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit was conducted. The normalized high-frequency component (HFnu), i.e. ANIm, and the standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN), i.e. Energy, were recorded using the analgesia nociception index monitor (ANI). To estimate the severity and mortality we used the SOFA score and the date of discharge or date of death. RESULTS: A total of fourteen patients were finally included in the study. ANIm were higher in the non-survivor group (p = 0.003) and were correlated with higher IL-6 levels (p = 0.020). Energy was inversely correlated with SOFA (p = 0.039) and fewer survival days (p = 0.046). A limit value at 80 of ANIm, predicted mortalities with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 85.7%. In the case of Energy, a limit value of 0.41 ms predicted mortality with all predictive values of 71.4%. CONCLUSION: A low autonomic nervous system activity, i.e. low SDNN or Energy, and a predominance of the parasympathetic system, i.e. low HFnu or ANIm, due to the sympathetic depletion in COVID-19 patients are associated with a worse prognosis, higher mortality, and higher IL-6 levels.","Aragón-Benedí, Cristian; Oliver-Forniés, Pablo; Galluccio, Felice; Yamak Altinpulluk, Ece; Ergonenc, Tolga; El Sayed Allam, Abdallah; Salazar, Carlos; Fajardo-Pérez, Mario",PLoS One,407,21

Our aims were to assess the sensitivity and specificity of LFDs in a systematic review and summarise the sensitivity and specificity of these tests. METHODS: A targeted search of Pubmed and Medxriv, using PRISMA principles, was conducted identifying clinical studies assessing the sensitivity and specificity of LFDs as their primary outcome compared to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Based on extracted data sensitivity and specificity was calculated for each study. Data was pooled based on manufacturer of LFD and split based on operator (self-swab or by trained professional) and sensitivity and specificity data were calculated. RESULTS: Twenty-four papers were identified involving over 26,000 test results. Sensitivity from individual studies ranged from 37.7% (95% CI 30.6-45.5) to 99.2% (95% CI 95.5-99.9) and specificity from 92.4% (95% CI 87.5-95.5) to 100.0% (95% CI 99.7-100.0). Operation of the test by a trained professional or by the test subject with self-swabbing produced comparable results. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review identified that the performance of lateral flow devices is heterogeneous and dependent on the manufacturer. Some perform with high specificity but a great range of sensitivities were shown (38.32-99.19%). Test performance does not appear dependent on the operator. Potentially, LFDs could support the scaling up of mass testing to aid track and trace methodology and break the chain of transmission of COVID-19 with the additional benefit of providing individuals with the results in a much shorter time frame.","Mistry, Dylan A; Wang, Jenny Y; Moeser, Mika-Erik; Starkey, Thomas; Lee, Lennard Y W",BMC Infect Dis,407,21

Because of TCS inhibition effect on vast majority of bacterial species, it is important to explore fungal species and their involved enzymes in TCS biodegradation. The aim of this study was to compare the potential of two white rot fungi Pleurotus ostreatus and Trametes versicolor for TCS biodegradation through the whole cell culture of fungi in an aqueous culture medium. Additionally, the changes in ligninolytic enzyme activities and possible correlations and contributions of degradative enzymes during TCS biodegradation process were monitored. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was carried out using a factorial experiment with a completely randomized design in three replications. factorial design in The experimental factors included: two white rot fungi Pleurotus ostreatus and Trametes versicolor and uninoculated controls which were subjected to five levels of TCS concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 50â¯µgâ¯mL-1) to assess ligninolytic enzymatic activity during biodegradation of TCS. Samples were harvested periodically at three time intervals (4, 7 and 10 days). An AB SCIEX 3200 QTRAP LC-MS/MS system was used in order to analyze the biodegradation of TCS in liquid medium. RESULTS: Results suggested that the two white rot fungi responded differently when exposed to the different concentrations of TCS. In general, P. ostreatus exhibited more potential and ligninolytic enzymatic activity compared to T. versicolor. LC-MS/MS analyses also showed that P. ostreatus degraded TCS with higher efficiency compared to T. versicolor. In addition, almost all P. ostreatus biodegradation activity was completed within the first day of sampling. Contrasting, less efficient degradation was observed by T. versicolor, reaching around 88% of TCS biodegradation at concentration of 20â¯µg mL-1after 10 days. At higher TCS concentrations (&#8805;30â¯µgâ¯mL-1), the growth of T. versicolor severely inhibited and led to a drop in enzymatic activity and biodegradation. Furthermore, laccase and manganese peroxidase (MnP) were determined as more involved enzymes which significantly correlated to TCS biodegradation by T. versicolor and P. ostreatus, respectively. CONCLUSION: P. ostreatus might be considered as efficient fungus in biodegradation of high amount of TCS in environmental matrices. The results of the present study might provide insights for future investigations on potential of fungi for applications in bioaugmentation-based strategies to remove TCS from wastewater and activated sludge.","Mallak, Ayda Maadani; Lakzian, Amir; Khodaverdi, Elham; Haghnia, Gholam Hossein; Mahmoudi, Shima",Microb Pathog,407,24

Therefore, this meta-analysis study aims to investigate the incidence of liver injury among published literature from 2019-Jan-01 to 2020-April-03 to provide an outline for further studies on the liver injury of COVID-19. Four databases including Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Scopus were searched for studies published from 2019-Jan-01 to 2020-April-03. Data analysis and drawing of charts were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software Version 2.2 (Biostat, USA). The search yielded 450 publications, of which 64 potentially eligible studies were identified for full-text review and 21 studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria remained. A total of 4191 COVID-19 patients were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of liver injury was 19.5% (95% CI: 14.3-26.1). According to our results, there was significant heterogeneity among the 19 studies (X2 = 738.5; p < 0.001; I2 = 94.34%). Among 288 death cases, the pooled prevalence of liver injury was 22.8% (95% CI: 11.7-39.8). In summary, the COVID-19 disease itself can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases and even may lead to ARDS and multiple organ failure. The results of this systematic review highlight the importance of liver injury that may assist clinicians anywhere in the globe in controlling COVID-19-related infection and complications. Moreover, the prevalence of liver injury can be higher in severe cases than in mild cases.","Samidoust, Pirouz; Samidoust, Aryan; Samadani, Ali Akbar; Khoshdoz, Sara",Infez Med,407,29

Hence, available drugs for treatment of other viral infections may be useful to treat COVID-19. AREAS COVERED: The focus of the current review was studying the main characteristics of favipiravir and its usefulness to treat COVID-19. An electronic search was done by using Pubmed and Google scholar. EXPERT OPINION: Based on the mechanism of action and safety of favipiravir, the drug may be a promising candidate for compassionate use against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Favipiravir has a wide range of activity against many single-stranded RNA viruses, is well tolerated in humans and has a high barrier to resistance. However, high doses of the agent are necessary to obtain an efficient antiviral activity. Favipiravir is teratogen in pregnant women and associated with the hyperuricemia. Therefore, the administration of the drug should be well controlled. Investigating the antiviral prophylactic potency of favipiravir and search for its pro-drugs and/or analogs showing improved activity and/or safety are critical.","Hashemian, Seyed MohammadReza; Farhadi, Tayebeh; Velayati, Ali Akbar",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,407,9

In this study, we aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of older patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective investigation of hospitalized older patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1, 2020, to February 10, 2020. RESULTS: In total, 203 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, with a median age of 54 years (interquartile range, 41-68; range, 20-91 years). Men accounted for 108 (53.2%) of the cases, and 55 patients (27.1%) were more than 65 years of age. Among patients who were 65 years and older, the mortality rate was 34.5% (19/55), which was significantly higher than that of the younger patients at 4.7% (7/148). Common symptoms of older patients with COVID-19 included fever (94.5%; n = 52), dry cough (69.1%; n = 38), and chest distress (63.6%; n = 35). Compared with young patients, older patients had more laboratory abnormalities and comorbidities. Through a multivariate analysis of the causes of death in older patients, we found that males, comorbidities, time from disease onset to hospitalization, abnormal kidney function, and elevated procalcitonin levels were all significantly associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: In the recent outbreak of COVID-19, our local hospital in Wuhan found that patients aged 65 and older had greater initial comorbidities, more severe symptoms, and were more likely to experience multiorgan involvement and death, as compared to younger patients.","Chen, TieLong; Dai, Zhe; Mo, Pingzheng; Li, Xinyu; Ma, Zhiyong; Song, Shihui; Chen, Xiaoping; Luo, Mingqi; Liang, Ke; Gao, Shicheng; Zhang, Yongxi; Deng, Liping; Xiong, Yong",J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,407,16

Here, we used advanced sewershed modeling software to simulate SARS-CoV-2 RNA loss in sewersheds across Houston, TX under various temperatures and decay rates. Moreover, a novel metric, population times travel time (PT), was proposed to identify localities with a greater likelihood of undetected COVID-19 outbreaks and to aid in the placement of upstream samplers. Findings suggest that travel time has a greater influence on viral loss across the sewershed as compared to temperature. SARS-CoV-2 viral loss at median travel times was approximately two times greater in 20{degrees}C wastewater between the small sewershed, Chocolate Bayou, and the larger sewershed, 69th Street. Lastly, placement of upstream samplers according to the PT metric can provide a more representative snapshot of disease incidence in large sewersheds.

During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, ECT services have come under pressure or needed to close because of redirected resources and safety reasons. We investigated the impact of C/M-ECT discontinuation on relapse in patients with unipolar depressive disorder in Flanders, Belgium. METHODS: Between March 30 and June 18, 2020, all patients receiving C/M-ECT in 2 ECT centers were included. Continuation or maintenance electroconvulsive therapy was discontinued in 33 patients and continued in 4 patients. Relapse was defined as the need to restart ECT or the need for hospitalization. Depressive symptoms were assessed every 3 weeks using the Patient Health Questionnaire, the Clinical Global Impression Scale, and 2 additional patient-rated questions. RESULTS: Relapse in the discontinuation group was 60.6%. All 4 patients who continued ECT remained remitted. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed significantly shorter relapse rates for patients receiving bitemporal and/or frequent C/M-ECT (1- to 2-week intervals).

However, research examining the efficacy and safety of favipiravir for patients with COVID-19 is limited. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of published studies reporting the efficacy of favipiravir against COVID-19. Two investigators independently searched PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MedRxiv, and ClinicalTrials.gov (inception to September 2020) to identify eligible studies. A meta-analysis was performed to measure viral clearance and clinical improvement as the primary outcomes. RESULTS: Among 11 eligible studies, 5 included a comparator group. Comparing to the comparator group, the favipiravir group exhibited significantly better viral clearance on day 7 after the initiation of treatment (odds ratio [OR] = 2.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19-5.22), whereas no difference was noted on day 14 (OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 0.69-6.95). Although clinical improvement was significantly better in the favipiravir group on both days 7 and 14, the improvement was better on day 14 (OR = 3.03, 95% CI = 1.17-7.80) than on day 7 (OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.03-2.49). The estimated proportions of patients with viral clearance in the favipiravir arm on days 7 and 14 were 65.42 and 88.9%, respectively, versus 43.42 and 78.79%, respectively, in the comparator group.

A positive transformation has been brought about by innovative solutions in the health care sector that aim to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on human health. For instance, the use of telehealth has been on the rise amidst this public health emergency. OBJECTIVE: Given the unprecedented scale of the pandemic with no definitive endpoint, we aimed to scope the existing telehealth-related literature during a defined period of the ongoing pandemic (ie, January to June 2020). METHODS: Our scoping review was guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewer Manual. We systematically searched PubMed and Embase databases with specific eligibility criteria. Data extracted from the shortlisted articles included first author and affiliation, journal title, publication type, terminologies used to describe telehealth and their accompanying definitions, health discipline or medical specialties and subspecialties wherein telehealth had been applied, the purpose of telehealth use, and the authors' overall sentiment on telehealth use. We collated the available information and used descriptive statistics to analyze the synthesized data. RESULTS: In all, 543 articles published across 331 different journals were included in this scoping review. The Journal of Medical Internet Research and its sister journals featured the highest number of articles (25/543, 4.6%). Nearly all (533/543, 98.2%) articles were in English. The majority of the articles were opinions, commentaries, and perspectives (333/543, 61.3%). Most authors of the articles reviewed were from high-income countries (470/543, 86.6%), especially from the United States of America (237/543, 43.6%). In all, 39 different definitions were used to describe terms equivalent to telehealth. A small percentage (42/543, 7.7%) of the articles focused on the provision of COVID-19-related care. Moreover, 49.7% (270/543) of the articles primarily focused on the provision of multiple components of clinical care, and 23% (125/543) of the articles focused on various specialties and subspecialties of internal medicine. For a vast majority (461/543, 84.9%) of the articles, the authors expressed a celebratory sentiment about the use of telehealth. CONCLUSIONS: This review identified considerable emerging literature on telehealth during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic, albeit mostly from high-income countries. There is compelling evidence to suggest that telehealth may have a significant effect on advancing health care in the future. However, the feasibility and application of telehealth in resource-limited settings and low- and middle-income countries must be established to avail its potential and transform health care for the world's population. Given the rapidity with which telehealth is advancing, a global consensus on definitions, boundaries, protocols, monitoring, evaluation, and data privacy is urgently needed.","Doraiswamy, Sathyanarayanan; Abraham, Amit; Mamtani, Ravinder; Cheema, Sohaila",J Med Internet Res,407,16

A cross-sectional, descriptive observational study was conducted with a total of 16,372 Spanish participants. An online survey was used to gather data for 5 consecutive days over the compulsory lockdown period which was established after the state of emergency was declared. There is an association between socio-demographic variables and risk perception, and a very strong relationship between this perception and contact and direct experience with the virus in a family, social or professional setting. We also found that compared to working from home, working outside the home increased the perception of risk of infection and the perception of worsening health.

METHODS: Both the reporting odds ratio (ROR) method and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) were applied to analyze safety signals of chloroquine based upon the adverse drug events (ADEs) data ranging from 2004 to 2020 as reported in the Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and to systematically assesse the safety signals of chloroquine phosphate on various organs systems. RESULTS: Among the 2 063 reports of ADEs studied, 557 reports were considered to be mainly caused by chloroquine. The results demonstrated that the high-risk ADEs signals of chloroquine involved various systems, such as atrioventricular block complete (ROR=2.90, IC-2SD=1.64), ventricular fibrillation (ROR=3.40, IC-2SD=1.27), blindness (ROR=27.51, IC-2SD=0.55), cardiogenic shock (ROR=6.86, IC-2SD=0.54), vomiting (ROR=1.70, IC-2SD=1.83). Moreover, some rare ADEs with high-risk signals showed a correlation with chloroquine, including hypokalaemia (ROR=4.18,IC-2SD=1.51), renal failure acute (ROR=3.08, IC-2SD=0.30), methaemoglobinaemia (ROR=4.37, IC-2SD=0.03), and pyrexia (ROR=1.80, IC-2SD=1.84), which were consistent with literature reports. However, these ADEs were not listed in instruction and worth much attention in clinic. Moreover, basic diseases of patients and drug incompatibility need much attention to prevent the occurrence and exacerbation of chloroquine-related adverse reactions. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive analysis of the ADEs signals of chloroquine could shed some light on understanding of its safety characteristics and would provide valuable information for rational use of chloroquine in clinic, especially in treatment of COVID-19.","Hu, Xi; Hong, Dong-Sheng; Yang, Hong-Yu; Zheng, Dong-Sheng; Zhao, Qing-Wei",Chin.

In the United States, race, gender, age, and education have affected vulnerability to COVID-19 infection. Yet, consequences likely extend far beyond morbidity and mortality. Temporarily closing the economy sent shock waves through communities, raising the possibility that social inequities, preexisting and current, have weakened economic resiliency and reinforced disadvantage, especially among groups most devastated by the Great Recession. We address pandemic precarity, or risk for material and financial insecurity, in Indiana, where manufacturing loss is high, metro areas ranked among the hardest hit by the Great Recession nationally, and health indicators stand in the bottom quintile. Using longitudinal data (n = 994) from the Person to Person Health Interview Study, fielded in 2019-2020 and again during Indiana's initial stay-at-home order, we provide a representative, probability-based assessment of adverse economic outcomes of the pandemic. Survey-weighted multivariate regressions, controlling for preexisting inequality, find Black adults over 3 times as likely as Whites to report food insecurity, being laid off, or being unemployed. Residents without a college degree are twice as likely to report food insecurity (compared to some college), while those not completing high school (compared to bachelor's degree) are 4 times as likely to do so. Younger adults and women were also more likely to report economic hardships. Together, the results support contentions of a Matthew Effect, where pandemic precarity disproportionately affects historically disadvantaged groups, widening inequality. Strategically deployed relief efforts and longer-term policy reforms are needed to challenge the perennial and unequal impact of disasters.","Perry, Brea L; Aronson, Brian; Pescosolido, Bernice A",Proc.

Experience with influenza shows that infection primes CD8+ T cell memory to peptides presented by common HLA types like HLA-A2, which enhances recovery and diminishes clinical severity upon reinfection. Stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells from COVID-19 convalescent patients with overlapping peptides from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to the clonal expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in vitro, with CD4+ T cells being robust. We identified two HLA-A*02:01-restricted SARS-CoV-2-specfic CD8+ T cell epitopes, A2/S269-277 and A2/Orf1ab3183-3191 Using peptide-HLA tetramer enrichment, direct ex vivo assessment of A2/S269 +CD8+ and A2/Orf1ab3183 +CD8+ populations indicated that A2/S269 +CD8+ T cells were detected at comparable frequencies (â¼1.3 × 10-5) in acute and convalescent HLA-A*02:01+ patients. These frequencies were higher than those found in uninfected HLA-A*02:01+ donors (â¼2.5 × 10-6), but low when compared to frequencies for influenza-specific (A2/M158) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific (A2/BMLF1280) (â¼1.38 × 10-4) populations. Phenotyping A2/S269 +CD8+ T cells from COVID-19 convalescents ex vivo showed that A2/S269 +CD8+ T cells were predominantly negative for CD38, HLA-DR, PD-1, and CD71 activation markers, although the majority of total CD8+ T cells expressed granzymes and/or perforin. Furthermore, the bias toward naïve, stem cell memory and central memory A2/S269 +CD8+ T cells rather than effector memory populations suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be compromising CD8+ T cell activation. Priming with appropriate vaccines may thus be beneficial for optimizing CD8+ T cell immunity in COVID-19.","Habel, Jennifer R; Nguyen, Thi H O; van de Sandt, Carolien E; Juno, Jennifer A; Chaurasia, Priyanka; Wragg, Kathleen; Koutsakos, Marios; Hensen, Luca; Jia, Xiaoxiao; Chua, Brendon; Zhang, Wuji; Tan, Hyon-Xhi; Flanagan, Katie L; Doolan, Denise L; Torresi, Joseph; Chen, Weisan; Wakim, Linda M; Cheng, Allen C; Doherty, Peter C; Petersen, Jan; Rossjohn, Jamie; Wheatley, Adam K; Kent, Stephen J; Rowntree, Louise C; Kedzierska, Katherine",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,407,1

Nevertheless, our knowledge and efficacy are quite limited in terms of measuring and evaluating all the variables and components that affect the management of medication adherence regimes as a complex phenomenon. The study aim is mapping the state-of-the-art of medication adherence measurement and assessment methods applied in chronic conditions. Specifically, we are interested in what methods and assessment procedures are currently used to tackle medication adherence. We explore whether Big Data techniques are adopted to improve decision-making procedures regarding patients' adherence, and the possible role of digital technologies in supporting interventions for improving patient adherence and avoiding waste or harm. METHODS: A scoping literature review and bibliometric analysis were used. Arksey and O'Malley's framework was adopted to scope the review process, and a bibliometric analysis was applied to observe the evolution of the scientific literature and identify specific characteristics of the related knowledge domain. RESULTS: A total of 533 articles were retrieved from the Scopus academic database and selected for the bibliometric analysis. Sixty-one studies were identified and included in the final analysis. The Morisky medication adherence scale (36%) was the most frequently adopted baseline measurement tool, and cardiovascular/hypertension disease, the most investigated illness (38%).

In this article, via data collected from 16 interviews-5 with Dayun and 11 with mothers, we explore a maternity care system in tension between the past and the present, the DaI and the doctor. We ask, what does the maternity care provided by the Dayun look like during times of normalcy, and how does it differ during COVID-19? We look at the roles the DaI has traditionally performed and how these roles have been changing, both in ordinary and in Covidian circumstances. Presenting the words of the Dayun we interviewed, all from Pakistan's Sindh Province, we demonstrate their practices and show that these have not changed during this present pandemic, as these Dayun, like many others in Sindh Province, do not believe that COVID-19 is real-or are at least suspect that it is not. To contextualize the Dayun, we also briefly present local mother's perceptions of the Dayun in their regions, which vary between extremely positive and extremely negative.

Because bariatric surgery successfully treats obesity-related conditions, we hypothesized that prior bariatric surgery may be associated with less severe COVID-19 disease. Objectives To examine the association between prior bariatric surgery and outcomes in patients with obesity admitted with COVID-19 Setting United States Methods Vizient database was used to obtain demographic and outcomes data for adults with obesity admitted with COVID-19 from May 2020-January 2021. Patients were divided into two groups: those with and those without prior bariatric surgery. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were mortality by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and comorbidity, intubation rate, hemodialysis rate, and length of stay (LOS). As the database only provides aggregate data, and not patient-level data, multivariate analysis could not be performed. Results Among the 124,699 patients with obesity admitted with COVID-19, 2,607 had previous bariatric surgery and 122,092 did not. The proportion of patients >65-years-old was higher in the non-bariatric surgery group (36.0% vs. 27.6%, p<0.0001). Compared to patients without prior bariatric surgery, patients with prior bariatric surgery had lower in-hospital mortality (7.8 vs. 11.2%, p<0.0001) and intubation rates (18.5% vs. 23.6%, p=0.0009). Hemodialysis rate (7.2% vs. 6.9%, p=0.5) and LOS (8.8 vs. 9.6 days, p=0.8) were similar between groups. Mortality was significantly lower in the bariatric surgery group for patients 18-64-years-old (5.9% vs. 7.4%, p=0.01) and >65-years-old (12.9% vs. 17.9%, p=0.0006). Conclusions This retrospective cohort study found that inpatients with obesity and COVID-19 who had prior bariatric surgery had improved outcomes compared to a similar cohort without prior bariatric surgery. Further studies should examine mechanisms for the association between bariatric surgery and less severe COVID-19.

Here, we use ground-level observations and model simulations to examine the nationwide spatial-temporal variations of six air pollutants before and after the initiation of First-Level Public Health Emergency Response. The level of ambient NO2 declined significantly, and in most cities, the decline was dominated by reduced emissions. Meanwhile, the level of O3 increased significantly during this period, and the nonmeteorological factors explained the increase. For the other air pollutants (PM2.5, SO2, and CO), the observed declines on the national scale were obviously affected by the meteorological conditions. In Wuhan, significant declines were found for air pollutants except O3 and emissions dominated the changes, while in Beijing during the same period, only the level of NO2 significantly declined. This study clearly shows that the meteorological changes contributed substantially to the observed changes in most air pollutants, and this must be considered in evaluating the impacts of pollutant source changes on air quality during the specific event and in assessing source-oriented risks.","Zhao, Yanbin; Zhang, Kun; Xu, Xiaotian; Shen, Huizhong; Zhu, Xi; Zhang, Yanxu; Hu, Yongtao; Shen, Guofeng",Environ.

In most cases, it is fatal in humans due to respiratory malfunction. Extensive researches are going to find an effective therapeutic technique for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. In this study, we attempted to design a siRNA molecule to silence the most suitable nucleocapsid(N) gene of SARS-CoV-2, which play a major role during viral pathogenesis, replication, encapsidation and RNA packaging. At first, 270 complete N gene sequences of different strains in Bangladesh of these viruses were retrieved from the NCBI database. Different computational methods were used to design siRNA molecules. A siRNA molecule was built against these strains using the SiDirect 2.0 server. Using Mfold and the OligoCalc server, the siRNA molecule was tested for its secondary structure and GC material. The Clustal Omega tool was employed to evaluate any off-target harmony of the planned siRNA molecule. Herein, we proposed a duplex siRNA molecule that does not fit any off-target sequences for the gene silencing of SARS-CoV-2. To treat SARS-CoV-2 infections, currently, any effective therapy is not available. Our engineered siRNA molecule could give an alternative therapeutic approach against various sequenced SARS-CoV-2 strains in Bangladesh.","Bappy, Syed Shahariar; Shibly, Abu Zaffar; Sultana, Sorna; Mohiuddin, A K M; Kabir, Yearul",Comput Biol Chem,407,16

The current state of internal medicine (IM) interns' telehealth training at the start of residency is unknown. Objective: To characterize the attitudes, training, and preparedness of IM interns regarding the use of telehealth video and phone visits in ambulatory care. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of IM interns at four IM residency programs in the United States in 2020. Results: One hundred fifty-six surveys were analyzed (response rate 82%). Seventy-five percent of interns rated training in the use of real-time video and phone visits for ambulatory care as important or very important. The vast majority received no training (74%) or clinical experience (90% no prior video visits, 81% no prior phone visits) during medical school. More interns believed that primary care may be effectively delivered via video visits compared with phone visits (77% vs. 35%). Most interns (69%) missed clinical time during medical school due to the COVID-19 pandemic; 41% felt that the pandemic negatively affected their ambulatory care preparation. Overall, the majority of interns (58%) felt prepared for primary care; only 12% felt prepared to deliver primary care using either video or phone visits. Conclusions: Although IM interns had favorable attitudes toward video and phone visits, few had training or clinical experience; most felt unprepared. Residency programs may need to close training gaps for current interns in conducting telehealth video and phone visits.","Wong, Christopher J; Nath, Julia B; Pincavage, Amber T; Bird, Amber; Oyler, Julie L; Gill, Katherine; Kimel-Scott, Karen; Palecek, Eric; Overland, Maryann K",Telemed. j. e. health,407,27

METHODS: Weekly total screening mammograms performed throughout 2019 (baseline year) and 2020 (COVID-19-impacted year) were compared. Demographic and clinical characteristics, including age, race, ethnicity, breast density, breast cancer history, insurance status, imaging facility type used, and need for interpreter, were compared between patients imaged from March 16 to October 31 in 2019 (baseline cohort) and 2020 (COVID-19-impacted cohort). Census data and an online map service were used to impute socioeconomic variables and calculate travel times for each patient. Logistic regression was used to identify patient characteristics associated with a lower likelihood of returning for screening after COVID-19-related closures. RESULTS: The year-over-year cumulative difference in screening mammogram volumes peaked in week 21, with 2962 fewer exams in the COVID-19-impacted year. By week 47, this deficit had reduced by 49.4% to 1498. A lower likelihood of returning for screening after COVID-19-related closures was independently associated with younger age (odds ratio (OR) 0.78, p < 0.001), residence in a higher poverty area (OR 0.991, p = 0.014), lack of health insurance (OR 0.65, p = 0.007), need for an interpreter (OR 0.68, p = 0.029), longer travel time (OR 0.998, p < 0.001), and utilization of mobile mammography services (OR 0.27, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Several patient factors are associated with a lower likelihood of returning for screening mammography after COVID-19-related closures. Knowledge of these factors can guide targeted outreach to vulnerable patients to facilitate breast cancer screening.","Miller, Matthew M; Meneveau, Max O; Rochman, Carrie M; Schroen, Anneke T; Lattimore, Courtney M; Gaspard, Patricia A; Cubbage, Richard S; Showalter, Shayna L",Breast Cancer Res Treat,407,21

However, official data record infections after a critical and unpredictable delay. Moreover, people react to the health risks of the virus and also anticipate lockdowns. All of this makes it complex to quickly and accurately detect changing patterns in the virus's infection dynamic. We propose a machine learning procedure to identify structural breaks in the time series of COVID-19 cases. We consider the case of Italy, an early-affected country that was unprepared for the situation, and detect the dates of structural breaks induced by three national lockdowns so as to evaluate their effects and identify some related policy issues. The strong but significantly delayed effect of the first lockdown suggests a relevant announcement effect. In contrast, the last lockdown had significantly less impact. The proposed methodology is robust as a real-time procedure for early detection of the structural breaks: the impact of the first two lockdowns could have been correctly identified just the day after they actually occurred.","Bonacini, Luca; Gallo, Giovanni; Patriarca, Fabrizio",J Popul Econ,407,16

These cells are usually defective for many normal activities or functions due to significant genetic and epigenetic changes. Normal primary cell yields and viability from any original tissue specimens are usually relatively low or highly variable. These normal cells cease after a few passages or population doublings due to very limited proliferative capacity. Animal models (ferret, mouse, etc.) are often used to study virus-host interaction. However, viruses usually need to be adapted to the animals by several passages due to tropism restrictions including viral receptors and intracellular restrictions. Here we summarize applications of conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRCs), long-term cultures of normal airway epithelial cells from human nose to lung generated by conditional cell reprogramming (CR) technology, as an ex vivo model in studies of emerging viruses. CR allows to robustly propagate cells from non-invasive or minimally invasive specimens, for example, nasal or endobronchial brushing. This process is rapid (2 days) and conditional. The CRCs maintain their differentiation potential and lineage functions, and have been used for studies of adenovirus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza viruses, parvovirus, and SARS-CoV. The CRCs can be easily used for air-liquid interface (ALI) polarized 3D cultures, and these coupled CRC/ALI cultures mimic physiological conditions and are suitable for studies of viral entry including receptor binding and internalization, innate immune responses, viral replications, and drug discovery as an ex vivo model for emerging viruses.","Liu, Xuefeng; Wu, Yuntao; Rong, Lijun",Virol Sin,407,16

Muscle size is decreased during aging; however, it is typically delayed in models of extended lifespan such as the long-lived Ames Dwarf (df/df) mice and calorie restricted (CR) animals compared to age-match controls. In light of the protective and anabolic effects of RBM3 in muscle, we hypothesized that RBM3 expression is higher in long-lived animal models. Young and old df/df mice, and adult and old UM-HET3 CR mice were used to test this hypothesis. Gastrocnemius muscles were harvested and protein was isolated for RBM3 protein measurements. CR induced a 1.7 and 1.3-fold elevation in RBM3 protein abundance compared to adult and old male mice fed ad libitum (AL) diets, respectively; this effect was shared between males and females. Ames dwarfism induced a 4.6 and 2.7-fold elevation in RBM3 protein abundance in young and old df/df mice compared to normal control littermates, respectively. In contrast, there was an age-associated decrease in cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP), suggesting these effects are specific for RBM3. Lastly, there was an age-associated increase in RNA degradation marker decapping enzyme 2 (DCP2) in UM-HET3 mice that was mitigated by CR. These results show that muscle RBM3 expression is correlated with extended lifespan in both df/df and CR animals. Identifying how RBM3 exerts protective effects in muscle may yield new insights into healthy aging of skeletal muscle.","Hettinger, Zachary R; Confides, Amy L; Vanderklish, Peter W; Sidhom, Silvana; Masternak, Michal M; Dupont-Versteegden, Esther E",Exp Gerontol,407,16

Elevated ferritin has been observed in many patients with COVID-19. Several retrospective studies have shown ferritin levels can be correlated and predictive of poor outcomes in COVID-19, though a rigorous analysis has been lacking. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 942 adult COVID-19 patients admitted in March 2020 at a large New York City health system with available ferritin levels. RESULTS: The primary outcome, all-cause mortality, was observed in 265 (28.1%) patients. Patients who died had a significantly higher median admission and maximum ferritin levels than those who did not. However, death was poorly predicted by admission and maximum ferritin levels on receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis, with AUCs of 0.677 and 0.638, respectively. AUCs increased when the cohort was limited to progressively younger patients. Ferritin levels were minimally better at predicting our secondary outcomes. These included mechanical ventilation, observed in 280 (29.7%) patients with an ROC yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.769, and new renal replacement therapy, observed in 80 (8.5%) of patients with an ROC yielding an AUC of 0.787. We also performed a subset analysis on 22 patients with ferritins >20 000 ng/mL. None of the patients met HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria. Fifteen (68.2%) of these patients had suspected or confirmed bacterial infections. CONCLUSIONS: Though many patients with COVID-19 present with hyperferritinemia, elevated ferritin levels are not accurate predictors of outcomes and do not appear to be indicative of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.","Feld, Jonathan; Tremblay, Douglas; Thibaud, Santiago; Kessler, Alaina; Naymagon, Leonard",Int J Lab Hematol,407,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients (n=331) who presented to the emergency department and underwent chest CT and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with a time interval <7 days, which were subsequently found to be consistent with Sars-CoV-2 infection, were enrolled retrospectively. Two experienced radiologists evaluated the images in consensus, recording the number of pulmonary lobes with ground-glass opacities and with consolidation. A CT score was subsequently calculated based on the percentage involvement of each lobe. Clinical symptoms, comorbidities, and level of required hospitalisation were noted. In-hospital mortality was recorded and analysed via the Kaplan-Meier estimator. RESULTS: Males and females had the same age distribution. No statistically significant difference was found in the analysed CT features and in the CT score (p=0.31) between the sexes. More females were affected by two or more comorbidities (17.1% versus 7.5%, p=0.024), all comorbidities except diabetes were more prevalent in females. Women had a higher probability to be discharged home and a lower probability to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU; p=0.008), in-hospital mortality was inferior (13.5% versus 22%). CONCLUSION: Despite more comorbidities, women had lower hospital admission and mortality, which was independent of CT findings between both sexes.","Percivale, I; Danna, P S C; Falaschi, Z; Berardo, S; Gangi, S; Tricca, S; Castello, L M; Barini, M; Airoldi, C; Carriero, A",Clin Radiol,407,1

The utilization of trehalose as a nutrient source by bacteria relies on carbohydrate active enzymes, specifically those of the glycoside hydrolase family 37, to degrade the disaccharide into substituent glucose moieties for entry into metabolism. Environmental bacteria using oligosaccharides for nutrients often possess multiple carbohydrate active enzymes predicted to have the same biochemical activity, and therefore are thought to be functionally redundant. In this study, we characterized trehalose degradation by the biotechnologically important saprophytic bacterium Cellvibrio japonicus This bacterium possesses two predicted &#945;-&#945;-trehalase genes, tre37A and tre37B, and our investigation using mutational analysis found that only the former is essential for trehalose utilization by C. japonicus Heterologous expression experiments found that only the expression of the C. japonicus tre37A gene in an E. coli treA mutant strain allowed for full utilization of trehalose. Biochemical characterization of C. japonicus GH37 activity determined that the tre37A gene product is solely responsible for cleaving trehalose, and is an acidic &#945;-&#945;-trehalase. Bioinformatic and mutational analysis indicate that Tre37A directly cleaves trehalose to glucose in the periplasm, as C. japonicus does not possess a phosphotransferase system. This study facilitates the development of a comprehensive metabolic model for &#945;-linked disaccharides in C. japonicus, and more broadly expands our understanding of the strategies that saprophytic bacteria employ to capture diverse carbohydrates from the environment.IMPORTANCE The metabolism of &#945;-diglucosides like trehalose is becoming increasingly important due to its inclusion in a number of foods and its prevalence in the environment. Bacteria able to utilize trehalose in the human gut possess a competitive advantage, as do saprophytic microbes in terrestrial environments. While the biochemical mechanism of trehalose degradation is well understood, what is less clear is how bacteria acquire this metabolite from the environment. The significance of this report is that by using the model saprophyte Cellvibrio japonicus we were able to functionally characterize the two predicted trehalase enzymes that the bacterium possesses and determined that the two enzymes are not equivalent and are not functionally redundant. The results and approaches used to understand the complex physiology of &#945;-diglucoside metabolism from this study can be applied broadly to other polysaccharide-degrading bacteria.","Garcia, Cecelia A; Narrett, Jackson A; Gardner, Jeffrey G",,407,1

Furthermore, a new, minimally invasive strategy termed 'liquid biopsy' (LB) has revolutionized the field by allowing comprehensive cancer genomic profiling through the analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) released into the bloodstream. However, its detection requires extremely sensitive and efficient technologies. A powerful molecular tool based on the principle of 'divide and conquer' has emerged to solve this problem. Thus, digital PCR (dPCR) allows absolute and accurate quantification of target molecules. AREAS COVERED: : In this review we will discuss the fundamentals of dPCR and the most common approaches used for partition of samples and quantification. The advantages and limitations of dPCR will be mentioned in the context of the field of LB in oncology. EXPERT OPINION: In our opinion, dPCR has proven to be one of the most sensitive methods available for LB analysis, even though some aspects such as its capacity of multiplexing and protocol standardization still require further improvements. Furthermore, the increasing sensitivities and lower costs of next generation sequencing (NGS) methods position dPCR as a confirmatory and complementary technique for NGS results which will likely prove very useful for treatment monitoring and assessing minimal residual disease.","Moreno-Manuel, Andrea; Calabuig-Fariñas, Silvia; Obrador-Hevia, Antonia; Blasco, Ana; Fernández-Díaz, Amaya; Sirera, Rafael; Camps, Carlos; Jantus-Lewintre, Eloisa",Expert rev. mol. diagn,407,20

Due to the importance of chest x-ray data in studying COVID-19, there is a demand for state-of-the-art models capable of precisely segmenting chest x-rays before obtaining mask annotations about this sort of dataset. The dataset for exploring best pre-trained model is from Montgomery and Shenzhen hospital which had opened in 2014. The most famous technique is U-Net which has been used to many medical datasets including the Chest X-ray. However, most of variant U-Net mainly focus on extraction of contextual information and dense skip connection. There is still a large space for improving extraction of spatial feature. In this paper, we propose a dual encoder fusion U-Net framework for Chest X-rays based on Inception Convolutional Neural Network with dilation, Densely Connected Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network, which is named DEFU-Net.

In order to increase the width of network and enrich representation of features, the inception blocks with dilation have been used. The inception blocks can capture globally and locally spatial information by various receptive fields. Meanwhile, the features fusion of two path by summation preserve the context and the spatial information for decoding part. This multi-learning-scale model are benefiting in Chest X-ray dataset from two different manufacturers (Montgomery and Shenzhen hospital). The DEFU-Net achieves the better performance than basic U-Net, residual U-Net, BCDU-Net, modified R2U-Net and modified attention R2U-Net. This model is proved the feasibility for mixed dataset. The open source code for this proposed framework will be public soon.","Zhang, Lipei; Liu, Aozhi; Xiao, Jing; Taylor, Paul",,407,20

Although adequate hand hygiene (HH) behaviour and compliance is widely accepted as being the most effective self-protective measure in preventing the spread of diseases like COVID-19, previous research suggests that normal hand hygiene compliance is poor, but generally improves during a disease pandemic. This research aimed to evaluate the hand hygiene behaviour and compliance of the general public in the initial weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Ireland (NI). METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved the use of infrared-imaging cameras to observe the hand hygiene behaviour and compliance of the general public when using one set of male and female public restrooms. RESULTS: The findings of this study indicated that the level of hand hygiene compliance of the general public was poor in the initial weeks, with 82.93% overall not washing their hands adequately. CONCLUSIONS: Inadequate HH behaviour and compliance may have added significantly to the rapid rate of spread of COVID-19 in the initial weeks of the pandemic in NI. Current public health campaigns do not appear, based on this study, to have the desired impact and may need to be reviewed or re-enforced in order to achieve the levels of hand hygiene compliance required to slow the spread of COVID-19 and other communicable diseases in the future.","Lawson, Aaron; Cameron, Robert; Vaganay-Miller, Marie",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),407,1

In the COVID-19 pandemic episode the use of these devices has become widespread, but, due to the shortage of conventional continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices, alternative devices have been manufactured. The objective of this study is to describe the use of these devices, as well as their efficacy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data are collected from patients admitted for pneumonia due to COVID-19 at the IFEMA Field Hospital. Data are collected from 23 patients with respiratory failure and need for ventilatory support. RESULTS: Study carried out on a total of 23 patients, dated admission to IFEMA. Alternative CPAP was used in five patients (21.7%), while ventilatory support with a reservoir mask or Ventimask Venturi effect was used in the remaining 18 patients (78.3%). A progressive increase in saturation is observed in those patients in whom alternative CPAP was used (from 94% on average to 98 and 99% on average after 30 and 60 minutes with the mask, respectively), although this change was not significant (p = 0.058 and p = 0.122, respectively). No significant change in RF was observed at the beginning and end of the measurement in patients who used alternative CPAP (p = 0.423), but among those who did not use alternative CPAP (p = 0.001). A statistically significant improvement in the variable oxygen saturation / fraction inspired by oxygen is observed in patients who used alternative CPAP (p = 0.040) CONCLUSION: The use of these devices has helped the ventilatory work of several patients by improving their oxygenation parameters. To better observe the evolution of patients undergoing this therapy and compare them with patients with other types of ventilatory support, further studies are necessary.","Mateos-Rodríguez, Alonso; Ortega-Anselmi, Justo; Candel-González, Francisco Javier; Canora-Lebrato, Jesús; Fragiel-Saavedra, Marcos; Hernández-Píriz, Alba; Behzadi-Koocahni, Navid; González-Del Castillo, Juan; Pérez-Alonso, Antonio; de la Cruz-Conty, María Luisa; García-de Casasola, Gonzalo; Marco-Martínez, Javier; Zapatero-Gaviria, Antonio",Med Clin (Barc),407,26

Although most patients have mild symptoms or are even asymptomatic, there are patients who can develop serious complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or venous thromboembolism requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care. Hence, it is important to identify patients with a higher risk of complications in a timely manner. Thus, the objective of this paper is to review the hematological laboratory parameters that consistently are altered in COVID-19 and to identify their relationship with the severity of the disease. According to 11 selected reports, the frequency of patients aged > 65 years is higher among subjects severely affected or deceased; likewise, males predominantly suffer from comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes or obesity. Retrospective studies have identified alterations in various hematological and inflammatory parameters as part of the host's response to infection and a secondary increased risk of different thrombotic events. Among these altered parameters, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 have been tested as prognostic biomarkers due to their close relationship with the severity of the disease. Actually, they can reliably indicate the use of antithrombotic therapy at prophylactic or therapeutic doses (mainly D-dimer), as has already been established in those patients who, after an individualized assessment, appear to be at high risk for thrombotic events.","Ornelas-Ricardo, Diana; Jaloma-Cruz, Ana Rebeca",Tohoku J Exp Med,407,26

What environmental and financial benefits could be expected from valorizing DDGS to biochar and its reuse for natural gas substitution?

Intra-operative risks include cartilage damage when inserting multiple screws. A common post-operative complication is distal-varus collapse of the head. The aim of this study was to investigate if an Innovative technique (reduced number of screws and injection of a beta-TCP additivated partially resorbable cement) provides the same or better stability of the reconstructed head compared to the Standard technique (using more screws). A four-fragment fracture was simulated in six pairs of humeri, with partial removal of the cancellous bone to simulate osteoporotic ""eggshell"" defect. One humerus of each pair was repaired with a Standard (locking plate, 2 cortical and 6 locking screws), and the other with the Innovative technique (same plate, 2 cortical and only 3 locking screws, plus cement injection). The reconstructed specimens were subjected to a biomechanical test where a cyclic force of increasing amplitude was applied axially until failure. The Innovative reconstructions withstood a force 3.49 times larger than the contralateral Standard reconstructions before failure started. The maximum force before final collapse for the Innovative reconstructions was 4.24 times larger than the contralateral Standard reconstructions. These differences were statistically significant. The Innovative reconstructions, based on fewer screws and beta-TCP additivated acrylic cement, showed positive results, demonstrating better biomechanical properties compared to the Standard reconstructions. These laboratory findings, along with the advantages of a reduced number of screws, may help perform a surgically safer, and more effective procedure in osteoporotic patients.","Cristofolini, Luca; Morellato, Kavin; Cavallo, Marco; Guerra, Enrico",Med Eng Phys,407,5

However, the inflammatory response in Corona virus disease-19 (Covid-19) and its potential to cause collateral organ damage has not been fully elucidated to date. This study aims to characterize the acute cytokine response in a cohort of critically ill Covid-19 patients. METHOD: 24 adults with PCR-confirmed Covid-19 were included at time of admission to intensive care a median of eleven days after initial symptoms. Eleven adult patients admitted for elective abdominal surgery with preoperative plasma samples served as controls. All patients were included after informed consent was obtained. 27 cytokines were quantified in plasma. The expression of inflammatory mediators was then related to routine inflammatory markers, SAPS3, SOFA score, organ failure and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: A general increase in cytokine expression was observed in all Covid-19 patients. A strong correlation between respiratory failure and IL-1ra, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IP-10 expression was observed. Acute kidney injury development correlated well with increased levels of IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17a, IP-10 and MCP-1. Generally, the cohort demonstrated weaker correlations between cytokine expression and 30-day mortality out of which IL-8 showed the strongest signal in terms of mortality. CONCLUSION: The present study found that respiratory failure, acute kidney injury and 30-day mortality in critically ill Covid-19 patients are associated with moderate increases of a broad range of inflammatory mediators at time of admission.","Bülow Anderberg, Sara; Luther, Tomas; Berglund, Malin; Larsson, Rolf; Rubertsson, Sten; Lipcsey, Miklos; Larsson, Anders; Frithiof, Robert; Hultström, Michael",Cytokine,407,29

I fit the daily hospital data: arrivals in regular and critical care units, releases and deaths, using extended SEIR models. These involve ratios of evolutionary timescales to branching fractions, assumed uniform throughout a country, and the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, before and during the national lockdown, for each region of France. The joint-region Bayesian analysis allows precise evaluations of the time/fraction ratios and pre-hospitalized fractions. The hospital data are well fit by the models, except the arrivals in critical care, which decrease faster than predicted, indicating better treatment over time. Averaged over France, the analysis yields $R_0$= 3.4$\pm$0.1 before the lockdown and 0.65$\pm$0.04 (90% c.l.) during the lockdown, with small regional variations. On 11 May 2020, the Infection Fatality Rate in France was 4 $\pm$1% (90% c.l.), while the Feverish vastly outnumber the Asymptomatic, contrary to the early phases. Without the lockdown nor social distancing, over 2 million deaths from COVID-19 would have occurred throughout France, while a lockdown that would have been enforced 10 days earlier would have led to less than 1000 deaths. The fraction of immunized people reached a plateau below 1% throughout France (3% in Paris) by late April 2020 (95% c.l.), suggesting a lack of herd immunity.

Pathogenic yield varies by clinician and/or patient characteristics. Our objectives were to determine the pathogenic yield of genetic testing, the variability in rate of pathogenic results based on subject characteristics, and the percentage of pathogenic findings resulting in further medical recommendations in toddlers with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition diagnosis of ASD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 500 toddlers, 18 to 36 months, diagnosed with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ASD (mean age: 25.8 months, 79% male). Subject demographics, medical and neuropsychological characteristics, and genetic test results were abstracted. Genetic results were divided into negative or normal, variants of unknown significance, and pathogenic. Subject characteristics were compared across results. Manual chart review determined if further recommendations were made after pathogenic results. RESULTS: Over half of subjects (59.8%, n = 299) completed genetic testing, and of those, 36 (12.0%) had pathogenic findings. There were no significant differences in Bayley Scales of Infant Development cognitive (P = .112), language (P = .898), or motor scores (P = .488) among children with negative or normal findings versus a variant of unknown significance versus pathogenic findings. Medical recommendations in response to the genetic finding were made for 72.2% of those with pathogenic results. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reinforce the importance of genetic testing for toddlers diagnosed with ASD given the 12% yield and lack of phenotypic differences between subjects with and without pathogenic findings. The majority of pathogenic results lead to further medical recommendations.","Harris, Holly K; Sideridis, Georgios D; Barbaresi, William J; Harstad, Elizabeth",Pediatrics,407,27

Thermal physiology research has been ongoing since the late nineties. This research lies at the intersections of medicine, psychology, machine learning, optics, and affective computing. We will review the known factors of thermal vs. RGB imaging for facial emotion recognition. But we also propose that thermal imagery may provide a semi-anonymous modality for computer vision, over RGB, which has been plagued by misuse in facial recognition. However, the transition to adopting thermal imagery as a source for any human-centered AI task is not easy and relies on the availability of high fidelity data sources across multiple demographics and thorough validation. This paper takes the reader on a short review of machine learning in thermal FER and the limitations of collecting and developing thermal FER data for AI training.

We hypothesized that fewer patients administered this combination would require oxygen therapy, intensive care support, or a combination of both than those who did not. METHODS: This was a cohort observational study of all consecutive hospitalized patients &#8805;50 y of age with COVID-19 in a tertiary academic hospital. Before April 6, 2020, no patients received the (DMB) combination. After this date, patients were administered 1000 IU/d oral vitamin D3, 150 mg/d oral magnesium, and 500 mcg/d oral vitamin B12 upon admission if they did not require oxygen therapy. Primary outcome was deterioration leading to any form of oxygen therapy, intensive care support, or both. RESULTS: Between January 15 and April 15, 2020, we identified 43 consecutive patients &#8805;50 y of age with COVID-19. Seventeen patients received DMB before onset of primary outcome and 26 patients did not. Baseline demographic characteristics between the two groups were significantly different by age. In univariate analysis, age and hypertension had a significant influence on outcome. After adjusting for age or hypertension separately in a multivariate analysis, the intervention group retained protective significance. Fewer treated patients than controls required initiation of oxygen therapy during hospitalization (17.6 vs 61.5%, P = 0.006). DMB exposure was associated with odds ratios of 0.13 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03-0.59) and 0.20 (95% CI, 0.04-0.93) for oxygen therapy, intensive care support, or both on univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A vitamin D / magnesium / vitamin B12 combination in older COVID-19 patients was associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of patients with clinical deterioration requiring oxygen support, intensive care support, or both. This study supports further larger randomized controlled trials to ascertain the full benefit of this combination in ameliorating the severity of COVID-19.","Tan, Chuen Wen; Ho, Liam Pock; Kalimuddin, Shirin; Cherng, Benjamin Pei Zhi; Teh, Yii Ean; Thien, Siew Yee; Wong, Hei Man; Tern, Paul Jie Wen; Chandran, Manju; Chay, Jason Wai Mun; Nagarajan, Chandramouli; Sultana, Rehena; Low, Jenny Guek Hong; Ng, Heng Joo",Nutrition,407,16

METHODS: A convenience sample of older adult Israelis (Nâ¯=â¯277, mean ageâ¯=â¯69.58 ± 6.72) completed web-based questionnaires comprising loneliness, anxiety, depressive, and peritraumatic distress symptoms. They also reported how old they felt. RESULTS: The positive relationship between loneliness due to the COVID-19 pandemic and psychiatric symptoms was weak among those who felt younger than their age while this very same relationship was robust among those feeling older. CONCLUSIONS: Young subjective age may weaken the loneliness-symptom association among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older adults holding an older age identity are more susceptible to the adverse effects of loneliness. Although preliminary, the findings may inform screening and interventions. Subjective age may help identify those at high risk in suffering from loneliness, and suggest interventions aimed at ameliorating both loneliness and older subjective ages.","Shrira, Amit; Hoffman, Yaakov; Bodner, Ehud; Palgi, Yuval",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,407,1

Assessing local needs, identifying relevant interventions from among those already recommended for humanitarian settings or universally, and assessing the contextual feasibility of delivery for each candidate intervention are key steps in the framework.

Recent studies show upregulation of innate immuno-regulatory microRNA-146a and -155 in oral fluids of patients with type 2 diabetes as well as of patients with periodontitis. The aim was to investigate whether upregulation of these microRNAs may relate to patient susceptibility to the infection via modulation of SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry factors expression. METHODS: Due to limited experimental feasibility and health risks in Coronavirus Disease 2019, bioinformatic analyses combining with system biology were used as initial investigation of interaction between microRNA-146 and -155 and genes encoding SARS-CoV-2 entry factors. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry factors are expressed in salivary glands and masticatory mucosa (tongue) at different expression levels, comparable with those measured in lungs and tonsil. MicroRNA-146 and -155 are widely involved in the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 oral cellular entry factors and may enhance expression of ACE2 and modulate genes involved in host immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes- and periodontitis-induced increase in microRNA-146a and -155 in oral cavity is predicted to upregulate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression, essential SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors, and modulate host antiviral response. As it could suggest increased infectivity of diabetes and periodontitis patients, additional protective measures for periodontists are recommended.","Roganovic, Jelena R",J. periodontol. (1970),407,1

The expression analysis associated with reported risk factors for COVID-19 was also assessed. SARS-CoV-2 cases had higher ACE2, but lower TMPRSS2, BSG/CD147 and CTSB expression compared with negative cases. COVID-19 patients' age negatively affected ACE2 expression. MX1 and MX2 were higher in COVID-19 patients. A negative trend for MX1 and MX2 was observed as patients' age increased. Principal Component Analysis determined that ACE2, MX1, MX2, and BSG/CD147 expression was able to cluster non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 individuals. Multivariable regression showed that MX1 expression significantly increased for each unit of viral load increment. Altogether, these findings support differences in ACE2, MX1, MX2, and BSG/CD147 expression between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients and point out to MX1 as a critical responder in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Bizzotto, Juan; Sanchis, Pablo; Abbate, Mercedes; Lage-Vickers, Sofía; Lavignolle, Rosario; Toro, Ayelén; Olszevicki, Santiago; Sabater, Agustina; Cascardo, Florencia; Vazquez, Elba; Cotignola, Javier; Gueron, Geraldine",iScience,407,1

Patients with CKD have impaired immune functions that predispose them to an increased risk of infections, as well as virus-associated cancers and a diminished vaccine response. In this study, we aimed to identify clinical and laboratory parameters associated with in-hospital mortality in patients evaluated in the department of emergency (ER) and admitted with the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at the Baptist Hospital of Nicaragua (BHN). There were 37 patients with CKD, mean age 58.3 ± 14.1 years, admitted to BHN due to COVID-19, and among them, 24 (65.7%) were males (p = 0.016). During hospitalization, 23 patients with CKD (62.1%) died of complications associated with COVID-19 disease, which was a higher proportion (odds ratio (OR) 5.6, confidence interval (CI) 2.1-15.7, p = 0.001) compared to a group of 70 patients (64.8% males, mean age 57.5 ± 13.7 years) without CKD admitted during the same period in whom 28.5% died of COVID-19. In the entire cohort, the majority of patients presented with bilateral pneumonia, and the most common symptoms at admission were dyspnea, cough, and fever. Serum levels of D-dimer, ferritin and procalcitonin were significantly higher in patients with CKD compared with those without CKD. Multivariate analysis revealed that CKD, age (>60 years), and hypoxia measured in the ER were factors associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Among patients with CKD but not in those without CKD (OR 36.8, CI 1.5-88.3, p = 0.026), an increased monocytes-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) was associated with higher mortality and remained statistically significant after adjusting for confounders. The MLR measured in the ER may be useful for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with CKD and COVID-19 and could contribute to early risk stratification in this group.","Dávila-Collado, Ramsés; Jarquín-Durán, Oscar; Solís-Vallejo, Andrés; Nguyen, Mai Anh; Espinoza, J Luis",,407,24

METHODS: We performed a qualitative research based on an open-ended questionnaire that was conducted through an online platform for primary caregivers of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Participants were asked to describe the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on their caring for youth with diabetes, as well as the emotional burden that it has brought to their personal lives. Interview responses were coded and stratified by youth age: &#8804; 12 years (youth aged &#8804; 12 years) and between 13 and 18 years (youth aged > 12 years). The connections between the responses were identified based on either positive or negative content of the reported experience. Data were analyzed in accordance with an inductive reasoning methodology. RESULTS: A total of 318 participants (mean age of 40.3 ± 8.1 years old) were included, representing caregivers of youth aged 11.7 ± 4.3-year-old with diabetes duration of 5.1 ± 3.8 years. The preponderance of negative feelings was noteworthy. Regarding diabetes care, more than 80% of participants reported concern and anxiety about the changes in habits that accompanied the pandemic. Also, more than half of caregivers regretted the isolation of their youth, factors that were associated with greater difficulty in achieving good glycemic control. Regarding the personal burden experienced, the negative impact of uncertainties and concerns about the COVID-19 were present in almost all participants. CONCLUSION: The period of pandemic may lead to exhaustion in caregivers of youths with type 1 diabetes, which reflects the need for mental health support strategies to help those families.","Alessi, Janine; de Oliveira, Giovana B; Erthal, Isadora N; Teixeira, Julia B; Morello, Milena S; Ribeiro, Raquel J E; de Carvalho, Taíse R; Jaeger, Eduarda H; Schaan, Beatriz D; Telo, Gabriela H",Acta diabetol,407,1

In this study, 262 patients diagnosed with moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China, were analyzed. Data were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. Of all the 262 patients, 23 (8.8%) patients died and 239 (91.2%) were discharged. The median age was 63.5 years and 46.9% of patients were male. The main complaints were fever (83.6%), cough (63.4%), and fatigue (49.2%) in the surviving group, while there were more complaints of dyspnea (39.1%) and shortness of breath (56.5%) in the nonsurviving group. The main comorbidities were hypertension (35.5%), diabetes mellitus (16.4%), and coronary artery disease (9.9%). Morbidity is higher in elderly patients with more comorbidities. Patients were mainly treated with nasal cannula (93.9%), while the nonsurviving group received more invasive mechanical ventilation (39.1%). Arbidol (80.9%), ribavirin (36.6%), oseltamivir (38.9%), interferon (16.4%), and ganciclovir (14.5%) were used for the antiviral treatment. In the nonsurviving group, the number of white blood cells (WBC) was significantly increased and lymphocytes were decreased, and lymphopenia was more common. The levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were also significantly increased in the nonsurviving group.

Lancet (London, England) 395(10229):1054-62, 2020). While D-dimer is accepted as a disseminated intravascular coagulation marker, rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) also detects fibrinolysis (Wright FL et al. in Fibrinolysis shutdown correlates to thromboembolic events in severe COVID-19 infection. J Am Coll Surg (2020). Available from https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32422349/ [cited 14 Jun 2020]; Schmitt FCF et al. in Acute fibrinolysis shutdown occurs early in septic shock and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality: results of an observational pilot study. Ann Intensive Care 9(1):19, 2019). We describe the ROTEM profile in severely ill COVID-19 patients and compare it with the standard laboratory coagulation test. METHODS: Adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU were prospectively enrolled after Ethics Committee approval (HCB/2020/0371). All patients received venous thromboembolism prophylaxis; those on therapeutic anticoagulation were excluded. The standard laboratory coagulation test and ROTEM were performed simultaneously at 24-48 h after ICU admission. Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) scores were calculated at sample collection. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were included with median SOFA-score of 4 (2-6), DIC-score of 1 (0-3) and SIC-score of 1.8 (0.9). Median fibrinogen, D-dimer levels and platelet count were 6.2 (4.8-7.6 g/L), 1000 (600-4200 ng/ml) and 236 (136-364 109/L), respectively. Clot firmness was above the normal range in the EXTEM and FIBTEM tests while clot lysis was decreased. There was no significant correlation between ROTEM or D-dimer parameters and the SOFA score. CONCLUSION: In COVID-19 patients, the ROTEM pattern was characterized by a hypercoagulable state with decreased fibrinolytic capacity despite a paradoxical increase in D-dimer levels. We suggest that, in COVID-19 patients, the lungs could be the main source of D-dimer, while a systemic hypofibrinolytic state coexists. This hypothesis should be confirmed by future studies.","Ibañez, C; Perdomo, J; Calvo, A; Ferrando, C; Reverter, J C; Tassies, D; Blasi, A",J. thromb. thrombolysis,407,1

This study provides a structured analysis of the decision to delay AAA repair and quantify the potential for harm. METHODS: A decision tree was constructed modeling immediate repair of AAA relative to an initial non-operative (delayed repair) approach. Risk of COVID-19 contraction and mortality, aneurysm rupture, and operative mortality were considered. A deterministic sensitivity analysis for a range of patient ages (50 to >80), probability of COVID-19 infection (0.01%-30%), aneurysm size (5.5->7cm), and time horizons (3-9 months) was performed. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted for three representative ages (60, 70, 80). Analyses were conducted for endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) and open surgical repair (OSR). RESULTS: Patients with aneurysms 7cm or greater demonstrated a higher probability of survival when treated with immediate EVAR or OSR, compared to delayed repair, for patients under 80 years of age. When considering EVAR for aneurysms 5.5-6.9cm, immediate repair had a higher probability of survival except in settings with high probability of COVID-19 infection (10-30%) and advanced age (70-85+ years). A non-operative strategy maximized the probability of survival as patient age or operative risk increased. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that patients with large aneurysms (>7cm) faced a 5.4-7.7% absolute increase in the probability of mortality with a delay of repair of 3 months. Young patients (60-70 years) with 6-6.9cm aneurysms demonstrated an elevated risk of mortality (1.5-1.9%) with a delay of 3 months. Those with 5-5.9cm aneurysms demonstrated an increased survival with immediate repair in young patients (60), however this was small in magnitude (0.2-0.8%). The potential for harm increased as length of surgical delay increased. For elderly patients requiring OSR, in the context of endemic COVID-19, delay of repair improves probability of survival. CONCLUSION: The decision to delay operative repair of AAA should consider both patient age and local COVID-19 prevalence in addition to aneurysm size. EVAR should be considered when possible due to a reduced risk of harm and lower resource utilization.","McGuinness, Brandon; Troncone, Michael; James, Lyndon P; Bisch, Steve; Iyer, Vikram",J. vasc. surg,407,16

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to co-develop with physicians, patients with HF, and their caregivers a patient-oriented mHealth app, perform usability assessment, and investigate its effect on the quality of life of patients with HF and rate of hospitalizations in a pilot study. METHODS: The development of an mHealth app (The Hellenic Educational Self-care and Support Heart Failure app [ThessHF app]) was evidence based, including features based on previous clinically tested mHealth interventions and selected by a panel of HF expert physicians and discussed with patients with HF. At the end of alpha development, the app was rated by mHealth experts with the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS). The beta version was tested by patients with HF, who rated its design and content by means of the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ). Subsequently, a prospective pilot study (THESS-HF [THe Effect of a Specialized Smartphone app on Heart Failure patients' quality of self-care, quality of life and hospitalization rate]) was performed to investigate the effect of app use on patients with HF over a 3-month follow-up period. The primary endpoint was patients' quality of life, which was measured with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and the 5-level EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L). The secondary endpoints were the European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior Scale (EHFScBS) score and the hospitalization rate. RESULTS: A systematic review of mHealth-based HF interventions and expert panel suggestions yielded 18 separate app features, most of which were incorporated into the ThessHF app. A total of 14 patients and 5 mHealth experts evaluated the app. The results demonstrated a very good user experience (overall PSSUQ score 2.37 [SD 0.63], where 1 is the best, and a median MARS score of 4.55/5). Finally, 30 patients (male: n=26, 87%) participated in the THESS-HF pilot study (mean age 68.7 [SD 12.4] years). A significant increase in the quality of self-care was noted according to the EHFScBS, which increased by 4.4% (SD 7.2%) (P=.002). The mean quality of life increased nonsignificantly after 3 months according to both KCCQ (mean increase 5.8 [SD 15] points, P=.054) and EQ-5D-5L (mean increase 5.6% [SD 15.6%], P=.06) scores. The hospitalization rate for the follow-up duration was 3%. CONCLUSIONS: The need for telehealth services and remote self-care management in HF is of vital importance, especially in periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed a user-friendly mHealth app to promote remote self-care support in HF. In this pilot study, the use of the ThessHF app was associated with an increase in the quality of self-care. A future multicenter study will investigate the effect of the app use on long-term outcomes in patients with HF.","Bakogiannis, Constantinos; Tsarouchas, Anastasios; Mouselimis, Dimitrios; Lazaridis, Charalampos; Theofillogianakos, Efstratios K; Billis, Antonios; Tzikas, Stergios; Fragakis, Nikolaos; Bamidis, Panagiotis D; Papadopoulos, Christodoulos E; Vassilikos, Vassilios P",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,407,16

Incidence is unknown and data on bariatric practice is scarce. Covid-19 exposure status and outcomes of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) between the first two peaks of the pandemic are prospectively evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: During our ""opening-phase,"" candidates for SG were enrolled after written informed consent was obtained which specifically emphasized the additional risks of the Covid-19. Viral exposure history and swab/RNA testing were obtained from all. Preoperative antibody testing was also performed, once became available. Preoperative workout, definitions, and surgical technique were standard. Patients were followed up with video-calls. All perioperative data is prospectively recorded. RESULTS: Between June 23 and November 20, 87 consecutive SGs were performed without mortality and conversion with a 1.2% major early complication rate. Single complication was due to Covid-19, acutely becoming symptomatic one day following the SG. During the first year of the pandemic, a minimum of 13.8% of the patients had encountered the virus and the rate of developing postoperative symptomatic Covid-19 was 6.3% including a patient with full-blown Covid-19 pneumonia 1 day after SG. Results on weight loss matched expectations. CONCLUSION: Currently, differing from the first peak of pandemic, vaccines are underway although a more serious surge continues. Given the high rate of morbidity and mortality of Covid-19 infection early after elective operations, caution is warranted when balancing the expected benefit from an elective procedure against the risk of acquiring perioperative Covid-19 infection.","Yerdel, Mehmet Ali; Özgen, Görkem",Obes Surg,407,23

Our study aims to figure out the role of Smad4 in an insulin resistance (IR) cellular model using placental trophoblast cell line. Importantly, HTR8-Svneo cells, in the status of IR, indicated a significant increase in the expression of Smad4. Subsequently, the HTR8-Svneo cell line with up-regulated or depleted Smad4 was respectively achieved by the effective over-expressed plasmid or siRNA of Smad4. We found out that the deficiency of Smad4 could promote the insulin sensitivity and restrict the inflammatory response in IR group of cells with significant augment in glucose uptake, up-regulation of insulin signalling-related molecules and attenuation in inflammatory biomarker expressions. On the contrary, the over-expression of Smad4 showed a reversal effect on these alterations in IR group of cells. Besides, the positive effect of Smad4 on cell viability was also observed in our study. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a metabolic disorder whose major pathophysiological basis is demonstrated as insulin resistance (IR). Importantly, our findings indicate that the deficiency of Smad4 significantly improves the insulin sensitivity and relieves the inflammation in the cellular model of IR. Besides, the positive effect of Smad4 on cell viability was also observed in our study.

We have evaluated the current recommendations for treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu arteritis (TA) and addressed potential future therapeutic strategies. RECENT FINDINGS: While glucocorticoids (GCs) remain the gold standard for induction of remission, many patients relapse and acquire high cumulative GC exposure. Thus, GC-sparing therapies such as methotrexate are recommended for selected patients with GCA and all patients with TA. Recent high-quality evidence shows that tocilizumab is an effective GC-sparing agent in GCA. Non-biologic and biologic immunomodulators also appear to have GC-sparing properties in TA. Tocilizumab is now considered to be part of the standard treatment for GCA, particularly with relapsing disease, but questions on its use such as length of treatment and monitoring of disease activity remain open. High-quality evidence to guide treatment of TA is still lacking.","Hellmich, B; Águeda, A F; Monti, S; Luqmani, R",Curr Rheumatol Rep,407,29

The susceptibility of different animal species to SARS-CoV-2 is of concern due to the potential for interspecies transmission, and the requirement for pre-clinical animal models to develop effective countermeasures. In the current study, we determined the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to (i) replicate in porcine cell lines, (ii) establish infection in domestic pigs via experimental oral/intranasal/intratracheal inoculation, and (iii) transmit to co-housed naïve sentinel pigs. SARS-CoV-2 was able to replicate in two different porcine cell lines with cytopathic effects. Interestingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2-inoculated pigs showed evidence of clinical signs, viral replication or SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses. Moreover, none of the sentinel pigs displayed markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data indicate that although different porcine cell lines are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, five-week old pigs are not susceptible to infection via oral/intranasal/intratracheal challenge. Pigs are therefore unlikely to be significant carriers of SARS-CoV-2 and are not a suitable pre-clinical animal model to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis or efficacy of respective vaccines or therapeutics.","Meekins, David A; Morozov, Igor; Trujillo, Jessie D; Gaudreault, Natasha N; Bold, Dashzeveg; Carossino, Mariano; Artiaga, Bianca L; Indran, Sabarish V; Kwon, Taeyong; Balaraman, Velmurugan; Madden, Daniel W; Feldmann, Heinz; Henningson, Jamie; Ma, Wenjun; Balasuriya, Udeni B R; Richt, Juergen A",Emerg Microbes Infect,407,24

SARS-CoV-2 transmission being responsible for the current pandemic, appears through airborne aerosols and droplets, thus, there has been an intense focus on such aerosol-generating procedures, and their reduction. Hence the objective of this systematic review was to evaluate available data on three major measures: rubber dam application, pre-procedural oral rinse, and high-volume evacuators (HVE) aimed at reducing bio-aerosols. METHOD: PubMed via Ovid MEDLINE, EBSCO host, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases were searched between 01 January 1985 and 30 April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 156 records in English literature were identified, and 17 clinical studies with 724 patients included in the final analysis. Eligible articles revealed the inadequacy of three principle approaches used in contemporary dental practice to minimize such bio-aerosols, rubber dam application, pre-procedural oral rinses, and HVE. The latter is an extremely effective method to reduce bio-aerosols in dentistry, although no single method can provide blanket cover. CONCLUSION: Present systematic review indicates that employing combination strategies of rubber dam, with a pre-procedural antimicrobial oral rinse, and HVE may contain bio-aerosols during operative procedures.","Samaranayake, Lakshman Perera; Fakhruddin, Kausar Sadia; Buranawat, Borvornwut; Panduwawala, Chamila",Acta Odontol Scand,407,1

The strategy used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade antiviral immunity needs further investigation. Here, we reported that SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b inhibited types I and III IFN production by targeting multiple molecules of innate antiviral signaling pathways. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b impaired the induction of types I and III IFNs by Sendai virus and poly (I:C). SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b inhibited the activation of types I and III IFNs induced by the components of cytosolic dsRNA-sensing pathways of RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS signaling, including RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TBK1, and IKKÎµ, rather than IRF3-5D, which is the active form of IRF3. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b also suppressed the induction of types I and III IFNs by TRIF and STING, which are the adaptor protein of the endosome RNA-sensing pathway of TLR3-TRIF signaling and the adaptor protein of the cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway of cGAS-STING signaling, respectively. A mechanistic analysis revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b protein interacted with RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TRIF, STING, and TBK1 and impeded the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b facilitated the replication of the vesicular stomatitis virus. Therefore, the results showed that SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b negatively regulates antiviral immunity and thus facilitates viral replication. This study contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 impairs antiviral immunity and provides an essential clue to the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Han, Lulu; Zhuang, Meng-Wei; Deng, Jian; Zheng, Yi; Zhang, Jing; Nan, Mei-Ling; Zhang, Xue-Jing; Gao, Chengjiang; Wang, Pei-Hui",J Med Virol,407,17

However, few data from a European population have been published, especially from hypertensive patients. AIM: To study the association between ACEi or ARB treatments and major adverse outcomes during hospitalisation in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We studied 545 consecutive hypertensive patients admitted to our institution due to COVID-19 with respiratory involvement. We analysed the incidence of combined event (death or mechanical ventilatory support) during hospitalisation, as well as the time to independent events. RESULTS: 188 (34.5%) patients presented the combined endpoint. 182 (33.4%) patients died, and 21 (3.9%) needed mechanical ventilatory support. Patients with previous treatment with ACEi or ARB presented similar incidence of the combined endpoint during hospitalisation (31.6% vs. 41.8%; p = 0.08), with a lower all-cause mortality rate (30.4% vs. 41.2%; p = 0.03) compared with those without prior treatment. Use of ACEi or ARB was not independently associated with lower incidence of the combined endpoint [Adjusted OR 0.675 (95% CI 0.298-1.528; p = 0.146)], but it was associated with lower mortality [Adjusted OR 0.550 (95% CI 0.304-0.930; p = 0.047)]. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ACEi or ARB was associated with less incidence of all-cause death during hospitalisation among hypertensive patients admitted with COVID-19 respiratory infection.","Negreira-Caamaño, Martin; Piqueras-Flores, Jesus; Martínez-DelRio, Jorge; Nieto-Sandoval-Martin-DeLaSierra, Patricia; Aguila-Gordo, Daniel; Mateo-Gomez, Cristina; Salas-Bravo, Daniel; Rodriguez-Martinez, Marta; Negreira-Caamaño, Martín",High Blood Press Cardiovasc Prev,407,24

In Central America, strong lockdown measures started during March of 2020. We have used seismic stations from Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua to study the effects of these measures on seismic records by characterizing temporal variations in the high-frequency band (4-14 Hz) via spectral and amplitude analyses. In addition, we study the link between the reduction of seismic noise and the number of earthquake detection and felt reports in Costa Rica and Guatemala. We found that seismic stations near the capitals of Costa Rica, Guatemala, and El Salvador, presented a decrease in the typical seismic noise level from 200 to 140 nm, 100 to 80 nm, and 120 to 80 nm, respectively. Our results showed that the largest reduction of ~ 50% in seismic noise were observed in seismic stations near main airports, busy roads, and densely populated cities. In Nicaragua, the seismic noise levels remained constant (~ 40 nm) as no lockdown measures were applied. We noted that the decrease in seismic noise levels allowed to improve earthquake locations and increment the number of reports of low magnitude felt earthquakes. Our results imply that seismic data can be useful to verify the compliance of lockdown measures and to explore effects of the decrease in the seismic noise in the earthquake detection and felt reports.

At the same time, however, social media offers a promising avenue to stem the distribution of false claims - as evidenced by real-time corrections, crowdsourced fact-checking, and algorithmic tagging. Despite the growing attempts to correct misinformation on social media, there is still considerable ambiguity regarding the ability to effectively ameliorate the negative impact of false messages. To address this gap, the current study uses a meta-analysis to evaluate the relative impact of social media interventions designed to correct health-related misinformation (k = 24; N = 6,086). Additionally, the meta-analysis introduces theory-driven moderators that help delineate the effectiveness of social media interventions. The mean effect size of attempts to correct misinformation on social media was positive and significant (d = 0.40, 95% CI [0.25, 0.55], p =.0005) and a publication bias could not be excluded. Interventions were more effective in cases where participants were involved with the health topic, as well as when misinformation was distributed by news organizations (vs. peers) and debunked by experts (vs. non-experts).

Initial data suggest that smoking is a risk factor for COVID-19 symptom severity. Exposure to increased pandemic-related stress and subsequent worry about COVID-19 may amplify the desire to smoke to down-regulate distress. The present investigation sought to test this conceptual model by evaluating worry about COVID-19 in relation to COVID-19 coping motives for smoking, perceived barriers for smoking cessation, and smoking abstinence expectancies. Participants were 219 daily combustible cigarette smokers (55.70% female, Mage = 41.43 years, SD = 11.06). Six separate, two-step hierarchical linear regression models were conducted for each of the criterion variables. As expected, worry about COVID-19 was significantly and positively related to COVID-19 coping motives for smoking and perceived barriers for smoking cessation. Worry about COVID-19 also was a positively significant predictor of smoking abstinence expectancies of negative mood, somatic symptoms, and harmful consequences, but not positive consequences. The present study provides novel empirical evidence that worry about COVID-19 is related to key cognitive-affective smoking processes beyond the effects of age, sex, race, ethnicity, COVID-19 exposure, smoking rate, e-cigarette use status, and anxiety symptoms. These results highlight the potential utility in assessing level of worry about COVID-19, a transdiagnostic construct, among combustible cigarette smokers to better understand cognitive-affective factors that may maintain smoking behavior in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shepherd, Justin M; Fogle, Brienna; Garey, Lorra; Viana, Andres G; Zvolensky, Michael J",Cogn Behav Ther,407,16

The impact of locally produced disinfectant with operational training as a means to improve hygiene in resource-limited healthcare facilities and prevent HAI was evaluated. METHOD: In Burkina Faso, 4 types of electro-chlorinator devices that convert salt and water into sodium hypochlorite through electrolysis were installed in 26 healthcare facilities distributed across 3 sanitary districts. The program was evaluated at 4 months and 11 months and performance compared with a control group. RESULTS: After 11 months, over 90% of the facilities applied 8 of the 11 essential hygiene practices defined by the Ministry of Health, compared to 20% in the control group. 61.5% of the healthcare facilities improved the chlorine concentration of their sodium hypochlorite solutions, reaching an average concentration of 5.1 g/L compared to an average of 2.1 g/L in the control group. Additionally, a cost-benefit analysis demonstrated that locally produced sodium hypochlorite led to daily savings ranging between 2.7 and 53 euros depending on the device compared with the purchase of chlorine tablets.

The diagnostic performance of SARS-CoV-2 detection between healthcare worker-collected nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP + OP) swabs and patient performed self-collected random saliva was assessed. Paired NP + OP swabs and random saliva were collected and processed within 48 h of specimen collection from two cohort studies which recruited 562 asymptomatic adult candidates. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction targeting Open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and nucleocapsid (N) genes was performed and the results were compared. Overall, 65 of 562 (28.1%) candidates tested positive for COVID-19 based on random saliva, NP + OP swabs, or both testing techniques. The detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 was higher in random saliva compared to NP + OP testing (92.3%; 60/65 vs. 73.8%; 48/65; p < .05). The estimated sensitivity and specificity of random saliva were higher than NP + OP swabs (95.0; 99.9 vs. 72.2; 99.4). The Ct values of ORF1a and N genes were significantly lower in random saliva compared to NP + OP swabs specimens. Our findings demonstrate that random saliva is an alternative diagnostic specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Self-collected random oropharyngeal saliva is a valuable specimen that provides accurate SARS-CoV-2 surveillance testing of a community.","Rao, Mohan; Rashid, Fairuz A; Sabri, Fashihah S A H; Jamil, Nur Nadia; Seradja, Valentinus; Abdullah, Nurul A; Ahmad, Hanisah; Aren, S L; Ali, Shareh A S; Ghazali, Mawaddah; Manaf, Anizan A; Talib, Harishah; Hashim, Rohaidah; Zain, Rozainanee; Thayan, Ravindran; Amran, Fairuz; Aris, Tahir; Ahmad, Norazah",J Med Virol,407,26

The model has four components leading to a system of fractional order differential equations incorporating the refuge concept to study the lockdown effect in controlling COVID-19 spread in India. We investigate the model using the concept of Caputo fractional-order derivative. The goal of this model is to estimate the number of total infected, active cases, deaths, as well as recoveries from COVID-19 to control or minimize the above issues in India. The existence, uniqueness, non-negativity, and boundedness of the solutions are established. In addition, the local and global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium points of the fractional-order system and the basic reproduction number are studied for understanding and prediction of the transmission of COVID-19 in India. The next step is to carry out sensitivity analysis to find out which parameter is the most dominant to affect the disease's endemicity.

We describe the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment recommendations. RECENT FINDING: To date, no randomized prospective studies have been published; recommendations are based on some observational studies, case reports, and expert opinions. The article provides an overview of the most important publications, presents the current results of the German Registry for PIMS and expert recommendations for treatment. SUMMARY: MIS-C PIMS is a new syndrome that is associated with a variety of virus infections, and also with SARS-CoV-2. The main characteristics are fever, multiple organ dysfunction due to a hyper-inflammatory state. In particular, cardiac dysfunction and severe shock. A high proportion of patients require intensive medical care, but the absolute number of children with SARS-CoV-2 MIS-C is low. Medical therapy is based on pathophysiologic considerations and is not evidence-based. Immunoglobulins, steroids and biologics are used and lead to effective treatment. Therefore, the mortality rate is very low. Patients usually recover within days, sequelae are reported only in a minority of cases.","Piekarski, Florian; Steinbicker, Andrea U; Armann, Jakob P",Curr Opin Anaesthesiol,407,26

We aimed to explore the predictive value of clinical, laboratory and CT imaging characteristics on admission for short-term outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Methods: This multicenter, retrospective, observation study enrolled 703 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to 16 tertiary hospitals from 8 provinces in China between January 10, 2020 and March 13, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory data, CT imaging findings on admission and clinical outcomes were collected and compared. The primary endpoint was in-hospital death, the secondary endpoints were composite clinical adverse outcomes including in-hospital death, admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and requiring invasive mechanical ventilation support (IMV). Multivariable Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank test were used to explore risk factors related to in-hospital death and in-hospital adverse outcomes. Results: Of 703 patients, 55 (8%) developed adverse outcomes (including 33 deceased), 648 (92%) discharged without any adverse outcome. Multivariable regression analysis showed risk factors associated with in-hospital death included &#8805; 2 comorbidities (hazard ratio [HR], 6.734; 95% CI; 3.239-14.003, p < 0.001), leukocytosis (HR, 9.639; 95% CI, 4.572-20.321, p < 0.001), lymphopenia (HR, 4.579; 95% CI, 1.334-15.715, p = 0.016) and CT severity score > 14 (HR, 2.915; 95% CI, 1.376-6.177, p = 0.005) on admission, while older age (HR, 2.231; 95% CI, 1.124-4.427, p = 0.022), &#8805; 2 comorbidities (HR, 4.778; 95% CI; 2.451-9.315, p < 0.001), leukocytosis (HR, 6.349; 95% CI; 3.330-12.108, p < 0.001), lymphopenia (HR, 3.014; 95% CI; 1.356-6.697, p = 0.007) and CT severity score > 14 (HR, 1.946; 95% CI; 1.095-3.459, p = 0.023) were associated with increased odds of composite adverse outcomes.

Given the unknown incidence of adverse cardiac sequelae after COVID-19 infection in athletes, these leagues implemented a conservative return-to-play (RTP) cardiac testing program aligned with American College of Cardiology recommendations for all athletes testing positive for COVID-19. Objective: To assess the prevalence of detectable inflammatory heart disease in professional athletes with prior COVID-19 infection, using current RTP screening recommendations. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study reviewed RTP cardiac testing performed between May and October 2020 on professional athletes who had tested positive for COVID-19. The professional sports leagues (Major League Soccer, Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, National Football League, and the men's and women's National Basketball Association) implemented mandatory cardiac screening requirements for all players who had tested positive for COVID-19 prior to resumption of team-organized sports activities. Exposures: Troponin testing, electrocardiography (ECG), and resting echocardiography were performed after a positive COVID-19 test result. Interleague, deidentified cardiac data were pooled for collective analysis. Those with abnormal screening test results were referred for additional testing, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and/or stress echocardiography. Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of abnormal RTP test results potentially representing COVID-19-associated cardiac injury, and results and outcomes of additional testing generated by the initial screening process. Results: The study included 789 professional athletes (mean [SD] age, 25 [3] years; 777 men [98.5%]). A total of 460 athletes (58.3%) had prior symptomatic COVID-19 illness, and 329 (41.7%) were asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic (minimally symptomatic). Testing was performed a mean (SD) of 19 (17) days (range, 3-156 days) after a positive test result. Abnormal screening results were identified in 30 athletes (3.8%; troponin, 6 athletes [0.8%]; ECG, 10 athletes [1.3%]; echocardiography, 20 athletes [2.5%]), necessitating additional testing; 5 athletes (0.6%) ultimately had cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings suggesting inflammatory heart disease (myocarditis, 3; pericarditis, 2) that resulted in restriction from play. No adverse cardiac events occurred in athletes who underwent cardiac screening and resumed professional sport participation. Conclusions and Relevance: This study provides large-scale data assessing the prevalence of relevant COVID-19-associated cardiac pathology with implementation of current RTP screening recommendations. While long-term follow-up is ongoing, few cases of inflammatory heart disease have been detected, and a safe return to professional sports activity has thus far been achieved.","Martinez, Matthew W; Tucker, Andrew M; Bloom, O Josh; Green, Gary; DiFiori, John P; Solomon, Gary; Phelan, Dermot; Kim, Jonathan H; Meeuwisse, Willem; Sills, Allen K; Rowe, Dana; Bogoch, Isaac I; Smith, Paul T; Baggish, Aaron L; Putukian, Margot; Engel, David J",JAMA cardiol.

Because leukotriene receptor antagonists, such as montelukast have been shown to reduce both cytokine release and lung inflammation in preclinical models of viral influenza and acute respiratory distress syndrome, we hypothesized that therapy with montelukast could be used to treat COVID-19. The objective of this study was to determine if montelukast treatment would reduce the rate of clinical deterioration as measured by the COVID-19 Ordinal Scale. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 confirmed hospitalized patients treated with or without montelukast. We used ""clinical deterioration"" as the primary endpoint, a binary outcome defined as any increase in the Ordinal Scale value from Day 1 to Day 3 of the hospital stay, as these data were uniformly available for all admitted patients before hospital discharge. Rates of clinical deterioration between the montelukast and non-montelukast groups were compared using the Fisher's exact test. Univariate logistic regression was also used to assess the association between montelukast use and clinical deterioration. A total of 92 patients were analyzed, 30 who received montelukast at the discretion of the treating physician and 62 patients who did not receive montelukast. RESULTS: Patients receiving montelukast experienced significantly fewer events of clinical deterioration compared with patients not receiving montelukast (10% vs 32%, p = 0.022). Our findings suggest that montelukast associates with a reduction in clinical deterioration for COVID-19 confirmed patients as measured on the COVID-19 Ordinal Scale. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with montelukast had fewer events of clinical deterioration, indicating that this treatment may have clinical activity. While this retrospective study highlights a potential pathway for COVID-19 treatment, this hypothesis requires further study by prospective studies.","Khan, Ahsan R; Misdary, Christian; Yegya-Raman, Nikhil; Kim, Sinae; Narayanan, Navaneeth; Siddiqui, Sheraz; Salgame, Padmini; Radbel, Jared; Groote, Frank De; Michel, Carl; Mehnert, Janice; Hernandez, Caleb; Braciale, Thomas; Malhotra, Jyoti; Gentile, Michael A; Jabbour, Salma K",J Asthma,407,3

In addition, blood samples have been tested, but without consistent results and therefore the added value of this sample type is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR in blood samples obtained from PCR-proven COVID-19 patients and in addition to elaborate on the potential use of blood for diagnostics. In this single center study, blood samples drawn from patients at the emergency department with proven COVID-19 infection based on a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR in respiratory samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Samples from 118 patients were selected, of which 102 could be included in the study (median age was 65 (IQR 10), 65.7 % men). In six (5.9 %) of the tested samples, SARS-CoV-2 was identified by real-time PCR. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected by real-time PCR in plasma samples from patients with proven COVID-19, but only in a minority of the patients. Plasma should therefore not be used as primary sample in an acute phase setting to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Despite the harsh anti-COVID-19 measures imposed during the second wave, no positive results have been visible for months. While the authorities have expected citizens to abide by the measures, certain representatives of the authorities have sometimes ignored them. Rather than dealing strictly with issues to do with the virus, the government has raised particular sensitive ideological issues and created conflict, losing precious time and energy. Despite the existence of crisis communication plans, several principles for addressing the public were missing. Civil society's protests against the measures hold the potential to attract even harsher ones. The fight against the virus has absorbed tremendous medical capacities, thereby neglecting other diseases that may be expected, on top of the COVID-19 problems, to have a long-term negative impact on public health.","Malesic, M.",Journal of Comparative Politics,407,20

This article describes the unexpected impact that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had on community-based specialty practices across the United States, especially oncology practices. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted an electronic national survey of community-based specialty practice administrators to determine the impact of COVID-19 on their practices and their ability to manage through a global pandemic. The 22-question survey focused on an initial observation period of March 15, 2020, to May 15, 2020, compared with a second period of May 16, 2020, to August 15, 2020. RESULTS: Oncology practices accounted for 46% of the 155 specialty practices that participated in the survey. Overall, 57% of respondents saw at least a 30% decline in total patient volume and/or financial impact during the initial observation period, compared with a 38% decline for the oncology practices. More than 70% of all practices experienced improvement after May 15, 2020, with at least 60% improving regardless of specialty. The initial decline was primarily driven by declines in new patient volume and procedures. Approximately 62% of practices anticipate a moderate-to-significant impact on patient outcomes over the next 12 months. The impact expected was slightly higher in retina and ophthalmology practices than oncology. CONCLUSIONS: Although unexpectedly impacted in delivering care for their patients, specialty practices generally and oncology practices especially have been resilient by leveraging federal funds and adopting operational enhancements.","Gordan, Lucio N; Weidner, Susan",Am J Manag Care,407,13

METHODS: Data from the national prescription databases comprising the entire population of Denmark, Norway and Sweden between 2007 and 2015 were used to assess prescription medicine use and sold amount (in defined daily doses (DDDs)) of tramadol, other opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. RESULTS: From 2007 to 2015 the prevalence of tramadol users increased in Denmark from 45 to 52 per 1,000 residents, and in Norway from 20 to 41 per 1,000 residents. In Sweden, the prevalence decreased from 36 to 17 per 1,000 residents. In comparison, the prevalence of other opioid users decreased in Denmark and Norway, but increased in Sweden. During the study period, there were more female than male tramadol users in all three countries, and the prevalence of tramadol users tended to increase with age. The average tramadol DDD per treated patient remained fairly constant in Norway, while it increased in Denmark and Sweden. In Denmark and Norway, women received a higher DDD than men. The amount of sold tramadol and other opioids combined per 1,000 residents was highest in Denmark. CONCLUSIONS: From 2007 to 2015, the prescription patterns of tramadol and other opioids differed between the three countries. Tramadol was generally used more frequently by women. Women received higher DDD then men in Norway and Denmark, but not in Sweden. The prevalence of tramadol users tended to increase with age in all countries. FUNDING: none.

Controlling the spread of this disease has proven difficult despite several resources employed. Millions of hospitalizations and deaths have been observed, with thousands of cases occurring daily with many measures in place. Due to the complex nature of COVID-19, we proposed a system of time-fractional equations to better understand the transmission of the disease. Non-locality in the model has made fractional differential equations appropriate for modeling. Solving these types of models is computationally demanding. Our proposed generalized compartmental COVID-19 model incorporates effective contact rate, transition rate, quarantine rate, disease-induced death rate, natural death rate, natural recovery rate, and recovery rate of quarantine infected for a holistic study of the coronavirus disease. A detailed analysis of the proposed model is carried out, including the existence and uniqueness of solutions, local and global stability analysis of the disease-free equilibrium (symmetry), and sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, numerical solutions of the proposed model are obtained with the generalized Adam–Bashforth–Moulton method developed for the fractional-order model. Our analysis and solutions profile show that each of these incorporated parameters is very important in controlling the spread of COVID-19. Based on the results with different fractional-order, we observe that there seems to be a third or even fourth wave of the spike in cases of COVID-19, which is currently occurring in many countries.","Iyiola, Olaniyi Oduro Bismark Zabilowicz Trevor Iyiola Bose Kenes Daniel",Symmetry,407,24

Therefore, the manual classification of lung diseases is very hard to discover, particularly the distinction between COVID-19 and NON-COVID-19 disease. COVID-19 causes infections on one or both lungs which appear as inflammations across lung cells. This can lead to dangerous complications that might cause death in the case of gaining or having an immune disease. The problem of COVID-19 is that its symptoms are similar to conventional chest respiratory diseases like flu disease and chest pain while breathing or coughing produces mucus, high fever, absence of appetite, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. In most cases, a deep manual analysis of the chest’s X-ray or computed tomography (CT) image can lead to an authentic diagnosis of COVID-19. Otherwise, manual analysis is not sufficient to distinguish between pneumonia and COVID-19 disease. Thus, specialists need additional expensive tools to confirm their initial hypothesis or diagnosis using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test or MRI imaging. However, a traditional diagnosis of COVID-19 or other pneumonia takes a lot of time from specialists, which is so significant parameter in the case of a pandemic, whereas, a lot of patients are surcharging hospital services. In such a case, an automatic method for analyzing x-ray chest images is needed. In this regard, the research work has taken advantage of proposing a convolutional neural network method for COVID-19 and pneumonia classification. The X-ray processing have been chosen as a diagnosis way because of its availability in hospitals as a cheap imaging tool compared to other technologies. In this work, three CNN models based on VGG-16, VGG19, and MobileNet were trained using the zero-shot transfer learning technique. The best results are obtained on VGG-19 based model: 96.97% accuracy, 100% precision, 100% F1-score, and 99% recall. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Moujahid, H.; Cherradi, B.; Al-Sarem, M.; Bahatti, L.",Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies,407,16

In March 2020, New York City became the epicenter in the United States for the pandemic. On 27 March 2020, a Malayan tiger (Panthera tigris jacksoni) at the Bronx Zoo in New York City developed a cough and wheezing with subsequent inappetence. Over the next week, an additional Malayan tiger and two Amur tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) in the same building and three lions (Panthera leo krugeri) in a separate building also became ill. The index case was anesthetized for diagnostic workup. Physical examination and bloodwork results were unremarkable. Thoracic radiography and ultrasonography revealed a bronchial pattern with peribronchial cuffing and mild lung consolidation with alveolar-interstitial syndrome, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified by real-time, reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) on oropharyngeal and nasal swabs and tracheal wash fluid. Cytologic examination of tracheal wash fluid revealed necrosis, and viral RNA was detected in necrotic cells by in situ hybridization, confirming virus-associated tissue damage. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from the tracheal wash fluid of the index case, as well as the feces from one Amur tiger and one lion. Fecal viral RNA shedding was confirmed in all seven clinical cases and an asymptomatic Amur tiger. Respiratory signs abated within 1-5 days for most animals, although they persisted intermittently for 16 days in the index case. Fecal RNA shedding persisted for as long as 35 days beyond cessation of respiratory signs. This case series describes the clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of tigers and lions infected with SARS-CoV-2 and describes the duration of viral RNA fecal shedding in these cases.

Aims: The main objective of the study is to assess the results of the application of telematic consultations to limit the mobility of patients.The operational objectives are; to propose a consultation plan, to know how attendance limits consultations and to define which pathologies benefit the most from this plan. Methods: A scheme is proposed with the creation of pre-scheduled clinic to assess suitability and the possibility of carrying them out in a single non face-to-face act. Results: Phone call to 5619 patients were made with a lack of response of 19%The cases of 74% of the patients that answered were resolved virtually. There is a difference between units, obtaining a higher answering rate from patients appointed to specific clinic units, ORâ¯=â¯0.60, or to general trauma ones, ORâ¯=â¯0.67. The lowest answering rate was obtained from those derived from the emergency department.Twenty per cent of the consultations were not accompanied by complementary tests that would have favored the resolution in a single act. The general trauma consultations, ORâ¯=â¯0.34, postoperative control, ORâ¯=â¯0.49, and specific unit ones, ORâ¯=â¯0.40, were the ones that better met this requirement.Out of the remaining patients, the general trauma consultations, ORâ¯=â¯0.50, and those referred to units, ORâ¯=â¯0.54, were the ones that had a higher resolution rate without in- person consultation. Conclusions: The cases of 74% of the patients who answered the phone call were resolved virtually.Cases of 20% of the patients cannot be solved in a single act because they are derived without complementary tests.Osteosynthesis and postoperative arthroscopic follow-up consultations are the ones that need to be carried out in person the most.","Zamora Navas, P",Rev Esp Cir Ortop Traumatol (Engl Ed),407,16

In late 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged and caused the coronaviruses to disease 2019 (COVID-19), leading to the ongoing global outbreak. The other pandemic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), share a considerable level of similarities at genomic and protein levels. However, the differences between them lead to distinct behaviors. These differences result from the accumulation of mutations in the sequence and structure of spike (S) glycoprotein, which plays an essential role in coronavirus infection, pathogenicity, transmission, and evolution. In this review, we brought together many studies narrating a sequence of events and highlighting the differences among S proteins from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2.

In 2020, mortality due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic exceeded annual rates of death from TB. The impact of active COVID-19 and TB co-infection remain unclear. We present one of the first documented cases of active TB in the setting of COVID-19 infection in the United States. Case Report A 49-year-old man with a past medical history of mediastinal gray zone lymphoma and hypertension presented to the emergency room with a four-day history of diarrhea and hematochezia. The patient immigrated from Vietnam in 1995. Computed tomography imaging revealed thickening of the sigmoid wall, and bilateral pulmonary ground glass opacities consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia, which was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). He was also neutropenic from recent chemotherapy. On admission, he began experiencing worsening hypoxia with exertion, and was started on remdesivir and dexamethasone for COVID-19 infection. Serial chest radiographs revealed worsening bibasilar opacities. He continued to have higher oxygen requirements and maxed out on high-flow nasal cannula and non-rebreather with 88-90% oxygen saturation, requiring transfer to the intensive care unit. A complete infectious workup was performed at this point. Cytomegalovirus PCR was positive at 1486IU and was started on ganciclovir. A bronchoscopy was performed but all testing was negative, including that for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear. The patient continued to become increasingly hypoxic, acidotic, and septic, and eventually underwent tracheostomy. Twenty days post-bronchoscopy, cultures from the bronchoalveolar fluid came back positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). A new sputum sample was sent and was found to be smear positive (2+ AFB) and MTB PCR positive. The patient was initiated on rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol therapy. Unfortunately, the patient continued to decompensate and was unable to be weaned off the ventilator. Comfort care was initiated by the family and the patient passed away on hospital day 68. Discussion The patient had several risk factors for latent TB reactivation, including malignancy, long-term corticosteroid use, and COVID-19 infection. Early research has shown that risk of death and recovery time with COVID-19 may be higher in patients with previous or active TB compared to those without. In patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and multiple risk factors for immunosuppression, latent TB reactivation should be considered in addition to secondary superinfection.","Lee, G.; Stoll, J.

The published data are particularly relevant at present, during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency, to define a treatment strategy and to prioritize essential therapy. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and PubMED were systematically researched from outset through April 2020 using Mesh terms. Only randomized controlled trials (RCT), with one arm without adjuvant whole-breast irradiation (WBI), were included in the analysis. Recent literature regarding the COVID pandemic and BC RT was assessed. The reported RCTs identified a group of BC patients (pT1-2N0M0 R0, grade 1-2, estrogen receptor (ER) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative tumours) in which the absolute risk of local recurrence (LR) was considered low enough to omit RT. The most common risk factors were tumor diameter, nodal and receptor status. Adjuvant RT had a significant impact on LR but not on distant metastasis (DM) or death. During the COVID 19 pandemic, results from RTCs were re-considered to define treatment recommendations for BC patients. International scientific societies and radiation oncology experts suggested RT omission, whenever possible, in older adult early-stage BC patients. Adjuvant RT might be omitted in a highly selected group of older adult early-stage BC patients with favourable prognostic factors. Hypofractionated regimens should be the standard. RT omission, partial breast irradiation (PBI), and ultra- hypofractionated regimens could be considered in selected cases due to the pandemic.","Palumbo, Isabella; Borghesi, Simona; Gregucci, Fabiana; Falivene, Sara; Fontana, Antonella; Aristei, Cynthia; Ciabattoni, Antonella",Journal of geriatric oncology,407,16

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent curative resection of colon cancer (2006-2013) were identified from a prospective database and retrospectively analyzed. Risk for recurrence, overall survival, and survival after recurrence (SAR) were compared between left- and right-sided tumors using the log-rank test, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: We evaluated 673 patients (347 right-sided). There was no difference in overall recurrence rates (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-1.55; P = .75) or overall survival (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.75-1.97; P = .42) between right- and left-sided primary tumors. However, right-sided tumors were more likely to develop multi-focal and poor prognostic site recurrence (P = .04). Among the 71 patients who developed recurrence, those with right-sided tumors had significantly lower SAR (HR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.42-10.62; P = .008). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with colon cancer who underwent curative resection, tumor sidedness was not associated with recurrence risk. However, among patients who developed recurrence, right-sidedness was associated with unique recurrence patterns and inferior SAR. For patients presenting with localized disease, treatment stratification should not be based on tumor sidedness alone.","Malakorn, Songphol; Ouchi, Akira; Hu, Chung-Yuan; Sandhu, Lakhbir; Dasari, Arvind; You, Yi-Qian Nancy; Kopetz, E Scott; Ellis, Lee M; Chang, George J",,407,25

METHODS: We conducted a multicentre prospective study in pregnancy based on a universal antenatal screening program for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Throughout Spain 45 hospitals tested all women at admission on delivery ward using polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) for COVID-19 since late March 2020. The cohort of positive mothers and the concurrent sample of negative mothers was followed up until 6-weeks post-partum. Multivariable logistic regression analysis, adjusting for known confounding variables, determined the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the association of SARS-CoV-2 infection and obstetric outcomes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Preterm delivery (primary), premature rupture of membranes and neonatal intensive care unit admissions. RESULTS: Among 1009 screened pregnancies, 246 were SARS-CoV-2 positive. Compared to negative mothers (763 cases), SARS-CoV-2 infection increased the odds of preterm birth (34 vs 51, 13.8% vs 6.7%, aOR 2.12, 95% CI 1.32-3.36, p = 0.002); iatrogenic preterm delivery was more frequent in infected women (4.9% vs 1.3%, p = 0.001), while the occurrence of spontaneous preterm deliveries was statistically similar (6.1% vs 4.7%). An increased risk of premature rupture of membranes at term (39 vs 75, 15.8% vs 9.8%, aOR 1.70, 95% CI 1.11-2.57, p = 0.013) and neonatal intensive care unit admissions (23 vs 18, 9.3% vs 2.4%, aOR 4.62, 95% CI 2.43-8.94, p < 0.001) was also observed in positive mothers. CONCLUSION: This prospective multicentre study demonstrated that pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 have more infection-related obstetric morbidity. This hypothesis merits evaluation of a causal association in further research.","Martinez-Perez, Oscar; Prats Rodriguez, Pilar; Muner Hernandez, Marta; Encinas Pardilla, Maria Begoña; Perez Perez, Noelia; Vila Hernandez, Maria Rosa; Villalba Yarza, Ana; Nieto Velasco, Olga; Del Barrio Fernandez, Pablo Guillermo; Forcen Acebal, Laura; Orizales Lago, Carmen Maria; Martinez Varea, Alicia; Muñoz Abellana, Begoña; Suarez Arana, Maria; Fuentes Ricoy, Laura; Martinez Diago, Clara; Janeiro Freire, Maria Jesus; Alférez Alvarez-Mallo, Macarena; Casanova Pedraz, Cristina; Alomar Mateu, Onofre; Lesmes Heredia, Cristina; Wizner de Alva, Juan Carlos; Bernardo Vega, Rut; Macia Badia, Montserrat; Alvarez Colomo, Cristina; Sanchez Muñoz, Antonio; Pratcorona Alicart, Laia; Alonso Saiz, Ruben; Lopez Rodriguez, Monica; Del Carmen Barbancho Lopez, Maria; Meca Casbas, Marta Ruth; Vaquerizo Ruiz, Oscar; Moran Antolin, Eva; Nuñez Valera, Maria Jose; Fernandez Fernandez, Camino; Tubau Navarra, Albert; Cano Garcia, Alejandra Maria; Baena Luque, Carmen; Soldevilla Perez, Susana; Gastaca Abasolo, Irene; Adanez Garcia, Jose; Teulon Gonzalez, Maria; Puertas Prieto, Alberto; Ostos Serna, Rosa; Del Pilar Guadix Martin, Maria; Catalina Coello, Monica; Ferriols Perez, Elena; Caño Aguilar, Africa; De la Cruz Conty, Maria Luisa; Sainz Bueno, Jose Antonio",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,407,16

The protein not only plays an essential role in viral replication but also cleaves ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like interferon-stimulated gene 15 protein (ISG15) from host proteins, making it an important target for developing new antiviral drugs. In this study, we searched for novel, noncovalent potential PLpro inhibitors by employing a multistep in silico screening of a 15 million compound library. The selectivity of the best-scored compounds was evaluated by checking their binding affinity to the human ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), which, as a deubiquitylating enzyme, exhibits structural and functional similarities to the PLpro. As a result, we identified 387 potential, selective PLpro inhibitors, from which we retrieved the 20 best compounds according to their IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values toward PLpro estimated by a multiple linear regression model. The selected candidates display potential activity against the protein with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values in the nanomolar range from approximately 159 to 505 nM and mostly adopt a similar binding mode to the known, noncovalent SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors. We further propose the six most promising compounds for future in vitro evaluation. The results for the top potential PLpro inhibitors are deposited in the database prepared to facilitate research on anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.","Stasiulewicz, A.; Maksymiuk, A. W.; Nguyen, M.

This report describes the first high-throughput screen using a novel self-assembled monolayer desorption ionization (SAMDI)-ASMS methodology to reveal ligands for the human rhinovirus 3C (HRV3C) protease. The approach combines self-assembled monolayers of alkanethiolates on gold with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI TOF) mass spectrometry (MS), a technique termed SAMDI-ASMS. The primary screen of more than 100,000 compounds in pools of 8 compounds per well was completed in less than 8 h, and informs on the binding potential and selectivity of each compound. Initial hits were confirmed in follow-up SAMDI-ASMS experiments in single-concentration and dose-response curves. The ligands identified by SAMDI-ASMS were further validated using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) and in functional protease assays against HRV3C and the related SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro enzyme. SAMDI-ASMS offers key benefits for drug discovery over traditional ASMS approaches, including the high-throughput workflow and readout, minimizing compound misbehavior by using smaller compound pools, and up to a 50-fold reduction in reagent consumption. The flexibility of this novel technology opens avenues for high-throughput ASMS assays of any target, thereby accelerating drug discovery for diverse diseases.","Scholle, Michael D; McLaughlin, Doug; Gurard-Levin, Zachary A",SLAS Discov,407,14

The evidence from upper respiratory tract samples suggests that the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 peaks around symptom onset or a few days thereafter, and becomes undetectable about two weeks after symptom onset; however, viral loads from sputum samples may be higher, peak later and persist for longer. There is evidence of prolonged virus detection in stool samples, with unclear clinical significance. No study was found that definitively measured the duration of infectivity; however, patients may not be infectious for the entire duration of virus detection, as the presence of viral ribonucleic acid may not represent transmissible live virus.

We evaluated the feasibility of using SARS-CoV-2 peptide Kode Technology-modified red cells (C19-kodecytes) to develop an assay compatible with existing routine serologic platforms. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A panel of eight unique red cells modified using Kode Technology function-spacer-lipid constructs and bearing short SARS-CoV-2 peptides was developed (C19-kodecyte assay). Kodecytes were tested against undiluted expected antibody-negative and -positive plasma samples in manual tube and three column agglutination technology (CAT) platforms. Parallel analysis with the same peptides in solid phase by enzyme immunoassays was performed. Evaluation samples included >120 expected negative blood donor samples and >140 COVID-19 convalescent plasma samples, with independent serologic analysis from two centers. RESULTS: Specificity (negative reaction rate against expected negative samples) in three different CAT platforms against novel C19-kodecytes was >91%, which correlated with published literature. Sensitivity (positive reaction rate against expected positive convalescent, PCR-confirmed samples) ranged from 82% to 97% compared to 77% with the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay.

METHODS: We describe three patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were persistently positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Viral viability from longitudinally-collected specimens was assessed. Whole-genome sequencing and serological studies were performed to measure viral evolution and evidence of immune escape. FINDINGS: We found compelling evidence of ongoing replication and infectivity for up to 162 days from initial positive by subgenomic RNA, single-stranded RNA, and viral culture analysis. Our results reveal a broad spectrum of infectivity, host immune responses, and accumulation of mutations, some with the potential for immune escape.

METHODS: Telemedicine service was established by Faisalabad Medical University at two of its affiliated locations: (i) a 24-hour COVID-19 Telephone Helpline was established at the Director Emergency Office, Allied Hospital, and District Headquarter (DHQ) Hospital. (ii) A Telemedicine Clinic comprising consultants and postgraduate residents from different specialties was established at Chief Office, Allied Hospital. The data related to the number and categories of calls and advice provided were collected from 27th March 2020 to 31st July 2020. RESULTS: A total of 4582 calls were received, at both locations, during the study period, out of which 2325 callers (51%) were male, and 2257 (49%) were females. At Allied Hospital, 172 patients were advised accordingly for their complaints, whereas, at DHQ Hospital, 320 patients were advised accordingly for their complaints. At the Telemedicine Clinic only, a total of 2436 calls were received during the study period, 1474 (60%) callers were male, and 962 (40%) were female. The majority of the calls were received by medicine (43%), dermatology (21%), and paediatrics (11%) specialties, respectively. CONCLUSION: Despite some limitations, the benefits of telemedicine in this COVID-19 era are enormous and it is feasible to implement telemedicine services in developing countries. The developing countries must invest in the internet and technology access to facilitate telemedicine and other e-health services for not only curbing this pandemic but also to promote a more efficient healthcare system after the pandemic.","Nagra, Muhammad Haneef; Ehsan, Sumaira; Ahmad, Umair; Ali, Majid; Hussain, Hafiz Amjad; Bakar, Abu",Int J Clin Pract,407,3

Different reliability coefficients from classical test theory and the Rasch Measurement Model were meta-analyzed, heterogeneity among the most reported reliability estimates was examined by searching for moderators, and a predictive model to estimate the expected reliability was proposed. At least one reliability estimate was available for a total of 44 independent samples out of 42 studies, being that Cronbach's alpha was most frequently reported. The coefficients exhibited pooled estimates ranging from .85 to .90. The moderator analyses led to a predictive model in which the standard deviation of scores explained 36.7% of the total variability among alpha coefficients.

The Guidance Supplement is intended to provide aesthetic medicine physicians and their staffs with a practical guide to safety considerations to support clinic preparedness for patients seeking non-surgical aesthetic treatments and procedures following the return-to-work phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, once such activity is permitted by applicable law. Many federal, state and local governmental authorities, public health agencies and professional medical societies have promulgated COVID-19 orders and advisories applicable to health care practitioners. The Guidance Supplement is intended to provide aesthetic physicians and their staffs with an additional set of practical considerations for delivering aesthetic care safely and generally conducting business responsibly in the new world of COVID-19. Aesthetic providers will face new and unique challenges as government stay-at-home orders and related commercial limitations are eased, and the U.S. economy reopens and healthcare systems transition from providing only urgent and other essential treatment to resuming routine care and elective procedures and services. The medical aesthetic specialties will therefore wish to resume practice in order to ensure high quality, expert care is available, and importantly to help promote patients' positive self-image and sense of well-being following a lengthy and stressful period of quarantine. In a number of areas, this Guidance Supplement exceeds traditional aesthetic office safety precautions, recognizing reduced tolerance in an elective treatment environment for any risk associated with COVID-19's highly variable presentation and unpredictable course. The disease has placed a disturbing number of young, otherwise healthy patients in extremis with severe respiratory and renal failure, stroke, pericarditis, neurologic deficits and other suddenly life-threatening complications, in addition to its pernicious effects on those with pre-existing morbidities and advanced age. Accordingly, the Guidance Supplement seeks to establish an elevated safety profile for providing patient care while reducing, to the greatest extent reasonably possible, the risk of infectious processes to both patients and providers. While the Guidance Supplement cannot foreclose the risk of infection, nor serve to establish or modify any standards of care, it does offer actionable risk-mitigation considerations for general office comportment and for certain non-surgical procedures typically performed in aesthetic medical settings. It is axiomatic that all such considerations are necessarily subject to the ultimate judgment of each individual healthcare professional based on patient situation, procedure details, office environment, staffing constraints, equipment and testing availability, and local legal status and public health conditions.","Dover, Jeffrey S; Moran, Mary Lynn; Figueroa, Jose F; Furnas, Heather; Vyas, Jatin M; Wiviott, Lory D; Karchmer, Adolf W",,407,1

The international scientific community, following World Health Organization (WHO) indications, launched different trials for testing drugs putatively able to block the SARS-CoV-2 infection or treat the COVID-19 disease symptoms. In parallel, studies devoted to a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology are in the course for designing an effective vaccine. One of the human membrane proteins known to be docked by the virus is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), proposed to be responsible for viral entry in target cells. Recently, the 3D structure of ACE2 has been obtained, showing its physical interaction with B0AT1 (SLC6A19), a plasma membrane transporter involved in the trafficking of amino acids in cells. The receptor targeted by SARS-CoV-2 is a supercomplex formed by a dimer of ACE2-B0AT1, in which ACE2 binds the viral protein and B0AT1 stabilizes the heterodimer. As a serendipity occurrence, nimesulide was shown to abolish the transport function of B0AT1. Here we suggest including nimesulide in the list of drugs to be tested for the identification of co-adjuvants in the treatment of COVID-19.","Scalise, Mariafrancesca; Indiveri, Cesare",SLAS Discov,407,1

The model has been applied to a realistic case study considering a sociological structure of beneficiaries categorized by age and gender and representing the first decile of incomes of the Spanish population. The demand of macronutrients is satisfied by means of nine different groups of food, used to provide some level of variability in the consumption patterns of the beneficiaries. The results provide insight on cost-cutting opportunities related to centralizing the decision-making process, indicating a 10% reduction both in provisioning costs and food quantities. This suggests that the proposed model might serve as a tool for designing new strategies for the provisioning or evaluation of economic and social support policies for the food bank of Madrid.","Castañón, Rosendo; Campos, Fco Alberto; Doménech Martínez, Salvador; Villar, José",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),407,16

Our study aims to assess how palliative medicine physicians could follow up on cancer patients and barriers they faced, discuss their results, and evaluate their treatment response with the help of telemedicine. Materials and Methods: We conducted a prospective analysis of the smartphone-based telemedicine service at our palliative care (PC) unit from March 25, 2020, to May 13, 2020. We recorded the patient's reason for call, main barriers to a hospital visit, and the assistance given to them by the physician on call. Each caller was asked to measure his/her satisfaction with the service on a 4-point scale. Results: Out of 314 patients, 143 (45.54%) belonged to Delhi and 171 (54.46%) belonged to other states. 157 patients sought help for symptom management; 86 patients needed to restock their opioid medications. Seventy-one patients required information regarding their oncological treatments requiring consultation from other departments. Titration of oral opioids and medication prescription (n = 129), contact details of other PC units at their native state for opioid procurement (n = 55), and attachment to our community-based PC service (n = 22) were main modes of management. Fifty-six patients were very satisfied and 152 patients were satisfied with the service. Conclusion: Telemedicine is the future of health-care delivery systems. In PC, we deal with immunocompromised debilitated cancer patients and telemedicine is immensely helpful for us to provide holistic integrated care to these patients who are unable to visit hospitals regularly.","Biswas, Swagata; Adhikari, Shreya; Gupta, Nishkarsh; Garg, Rakesh; Bharti, Sachidanand; Kumar, Vinod; Mishra, Seema; Bhatnagar, Sushma",Indian J.

However, thus far, little is known about the traditional effects of L. barbarum on strengthening muscles. Therefore, this study focused on the effects of an extract of L. barbarum on skeletal muscles. First, the extract of L. barbarum significantly increased the mass of the tibial anterior muscle and gastrocnemius muscle and improved the average running distance of mice. Then, in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that the extract enhanced muscle endurance by increasing the proportion of type IIa oxidative muscle fibers and aerobic respiration. In an in-depth study of the molecular mechanism of these effects, we found that the extract upregulated the proportion of type IIa oxidative muscle fibers by activating ERRÎ³ and that the PKA-CREB signaling pathway was involved in its activation. This study is the first to show that L. barbarum extract modulates skeletal muscle remodeling and has mimetic effects on skeletal muscles in a manner similar to exercise. It provides a scientific explanation based on modern biological technologies and concepts for the traditional function of L. barbarum in improving muscle fitness. This study lays a theoretical foundation for the application of L. barbarum in skeletal muscles as an exercise mimetic.","Meng, Jiao; Lv, Zhenyu; Sun, Chuanxin; Qiao, Xinhua; Chen, Chang",FASEB J,407,16

The clinical spectrum of MIS-C ranges from mild to severe, and even to mortal multisystem involvement. To guide clinicians, we evaluated detailed demographic characteristics, clinical features, laboratory findings, and outcomes of MIS-C cases. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients with MIS-C who were managed in the Department of Pediatric Infectious Disease in the Selcuk University Faculty of Medicine, Konya, Turkey. MIS-C patients were divided into three clinical severity groups (mild, moderate, and severe) and separated into three age groups (< 5 years, 5-10 years, > 10 years). We compared the characteristics of MIS-C cases according to the severity of the disease and by age groups. RESULT: Thirty-six children with MIS-C were evaluated (52.8% male, median age of 7.8 years). A clinical spectrum overlapping with Kawasaki disease (KD) was the most common presentation (69.4%) in all age groups. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (100%), mucocutaneous rash (69.4%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (66.6%). There was no statistically significant difference in echocardiographic abnormality between KD-like and the other clinical spectra (p > 0.05). All life-threatening rhythm disturbances were observed in severe cases. No patients died. CONCLUSION: It is important to increase the awareness of physicians about the MIS-C disease, which can present with different combinations of different systemic findings, so that patients can be diagnosed and treated in a timely manner. Key Points â¢ A single tertiary centre study shows that children with MIS-C can present with different clinic spectra other than Kawasaki diseases. â¢ Electrocardiographic and echocardiographic evaluation is important in early diagnosis of children with MIS-C. â¢ Pro-BNP can be used as a screening test in the emergency room for children with prolonged and unexplained fever for determine early cardiac involvement of MIS-C. â¢ The lack of require biological agents and favourable outcomes in children with MIS-C may be related with administration of steroid therapy with IVIG in early stage of disease.","Alkan, Gulsum; Sert, Ahmet; Oz, Sadiye Kubra Tuter; Emiroglu, Melike; Yilmaz, Resul",Clin. rheumatol,407,16

UPSIDES (Using Peer Support In Developing Empowering mental health Services) is a six-country consortium carrying out implementation research on peer support for people with severe mental health conditions in high- (Germany, Israel), lower middle- (India) and low-income (Tanzania, Uganda) settings. This commentary briefly outlines some of the key challenges faced by UPSIDES sites in low- and middle-income countries as a result of Covid-19, sharing early lessons that may also apply to other services seeking to address the needs of people with severe mental health conditions in similar contexts. CHALLENGES AND LESSONS LEARNED: The key take-away from experiences in India, Tanzania and Uganda is that inequalities in terms of access to mobile technologies, as well as to secure employment and benefits, put peer support workers in particularly vulnerable situations precisely when they and their peers are also at their most isolated. Establishing more resilient peer support services requires attention to the already precarious situation of people with severe mental health conditions in low-resource settings, even before a crisis like Covid-19 occurs. While it is essential to maintain contact with peer support workers and peers to whatever extent is possible remotely, alternatives to face-to-face delivery of psychosocial interventions are not always straightforward to implement and can make it more difficult to observe individuals' reactions, talk about emotional issues and offer appropriate support. CONCLUSIONS: In environments where mental health care was already heavily medicalized and mostly limited to medications issued by psychiatric institutions, Covid-19 threatens burgeoning efforts to pursue a more holistic and person-centered model of care for people with severe mental health conditions. As countries emerge from lockdown, those working in global mental health will need to redouble their efforts not only to make up for lost time and help individuals cope with the added stressors of Covid-19 in their communities, but also to regain lost ground in mental health care reform and in broader conversations about mental health in low-resource settings.","Mpango, Richard; Kalha, Jasmine; Shamba, Donat; Ramesh, Mary; Ngakongwa, Fileuka; Kulkarni, Arti; Korde, Palak; Nakku, Juliet; Ryan, Grace K",Global Health,407,32

However, there has not yet been a national population-level study to quantify disparities in COVID-19 mortality outcomes across the intersection of these demographic dimensions. Here, we analyze a publicly available dataset from the National Center for Health Statistics comprising COVID-19 death counts stratified by race/ethnicity, sex, and age for the year 2020, calculating mortality rates for each race/ethnicity-sex-age stratum and age-adjusted mortality rates for each race/ethnicity-sex stratum, quantifying disparities in terms of mortality rate ratios and rate differences. Our results reveal persistently higher COVID-19 age-adjusted mortality rates for males compared to females within every racial/ethnic group, with notable variation in the magnitudes of the sex disparity by race/ethnicity. However, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native females have higher age-adjusted mortality rates than non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander males. Moreover, persistent racial/ethnic disparities are observed among both males and females, with higher COVID-19 age-adjusted mortality rates observed for non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Natives relative to non-Hispanic Whites.","Xu, Jay J; Chen, Jarvis T; Belin, Thomas R; Brookmeyer, Ronald S; Suchard, Marc A; Ramirez, Christina M",,407,16

However, the safety of cryopreservation has been controversial in unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, especially for bone marrow grafts. In addition, in unrelated HSCT, the effect of the time from harvest to cryopreservation of donor grafts required for the transportation of donor graft has not been fully clarified. STUDY DESIGN: In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the first 112 patients with available data who underwent cryopreserved unrelated blood and marrow transplantation through the Japan Marrow Donor Program during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: There were 112 patients, including 83 who received bone marrow (BM) graft and 29 who received peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) graft. The median time from stem cell harvest to cryopreservation was 9.9 hours (range 2.6-44.0 hours) and the median time from cryopreservation to infusion was 231.2 hours. The incidence of neutrophil engraftment at day 28 after HSCT was 91.1%, and among 109 patients (excluding 3 patients with early death), all but one achieved neutrophil engraftment within 60 days after HSCT. The time-to-neutrophil and time-to-platelet engraftment were shorter in PBSCT than in BMT, but these differences were not statistically significant (P=0.064 and P=0.18). Multivariate analysis among BM recipients revealed that a higher number of frozen nucleated cells and the absence of HLA mismatch were associated with faster neutrophil engraftment. The time-to-neutrophil engraftment after unrelated cryopreserved BMT was not different from that after unrelated BMT without cryopreservation. CONCLUSION: Unrelated donor BM and PBSC grafts can be safely cryopreserved even after the transit time from the harvest center to the transplantation center. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, cryopreservation can be considered as an option, while balancing the risks and benefits of the procedure.","Kanda, Yoshinobu; Inoue, Masami; Uchida, Naoyuki; Onishi, Yasushi; Kamata, Reiko; Kotaki, Mika; Kobayashi, Ryoji; Tanaka, Junji; Fukuda, Takahiro; Fujii, Nobuharu; Miyamura, Koichi; Mori, Shin-Ichiro; Mori, Yasuo; Morishima, Yasuo; Yabe, Hiromasa; Kodera, Yoshihisa",,407,16

Many efforts have been devoted to screening existing drug libraries with the hope to repurpose approved drugs as potential treatments for COVID-19. However, the antiviral mechanisms of action of the drugs found active in these phenotypic screens remain largely unknown. In an effort to deconvolute the viral targets in pursuit of more effective anti-COVID-19 drug development, we mined our in-house database of approved drug screens against 994 assays and compared their activity profiles with the drug activity profile in a cytopathic effect (CPE) assay of SARS-CoV-2. We found that the autophagy and AP-1 signaling pathway activity profiles are significantly correlated with the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity profile. In addition, a class of neurology/psychiatry drugs was found to be significantly enriched with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Taken together, these results provide new insights into SARS-CoV-2 infection and potential targets for COVID-19 therapeutics, which can be further validated by in vivo animal studies and human clinical trials.","Zhu, Hu; Chen, Catherine Z; Sakamuru, Srilatha; Zhao, Jinghua; Ngan, Deborah K; Simeonov, Anton; Hall, Mathew D; Xia, Menghang; Zheng, Wei; Huang, Ruili",Sci Rep,407,24

Whether youth will conform to these strategies is unclear. METHODS: We leverage data on 1,152 youth's mask-wearing and social-distancing behaviors from observations of five in-person live-streamed high school graduations from one U.S. public school district in July 2020. Multiple researchers took ethnographic field notes and systematically recorded public health behaviors for each graduation. We also use data from the local public health department, school district, newspapers, community observations, and the National Center for Education Statistics. We then conducted a descriptive quantitative analysis of mask-wearing status by gender, ethnicity, and school, along with a qualitative thematic analysis. RESULTS: Nearly 70% of students wore their masks properly while receiving their diploma, although 9.6% wore no mask and 18.7% struggled with mask fit. Almost all students removed masks for graduation photos after adults suggested they should, although 80% of them were wearing their mask properly before the photo. We found significant school variation, but no gender or ethnic variation in student mask-wearing. School variation aligned with political themes of student speeches and in adult commitment to safety measures. Student speakers at all schools mentioned altruistic concern about COVID-19. All schools struggled with social distancing throughout the ceremony, except when students were seated in socially distanced chairs. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides important insights into youth conformity to COVID-19 guidelines and strategies to protect public health during in-person schooling.","Mueller, Anna S; Diefendorf, Sarah; Abrutyn, Seth; Beardall, Katherine A; Millar, Krystina; O039,; Reilly, Lauren; Steinberg, Hillary; Watkins, James T",J Adolesc Health,407,9

The disease is caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, also known as the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). A custom convolutional neural network (CNN) and a selection of pretrained CNN models are trained on publicly available CXR collections to learn CXR modality-specific feature representations and the learned knowledge is transferred and fine-tuned to improve performance and generalization in the related task of classifying normal, bacterial pneumonia, and CXRs exhibiting COVID-19 abnormalities. The best performing models are iteratively pruned to identify optimal number of neurons in the convolutional layers to reduce complexity and improve memory efficiency. The predictions of the best-performing pruned models are combined through different ensemble strategies to improve classification performance. The custom and pretrained CNNs are evaluated at the patient-level to alleviate issues due to information leakage and reduce generalization errors. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the weighted average of the best-performing pruned models significantly improves performance resulting in an accuracy of 99.01% and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9972 in detecting COVID-19 findings on CXRs as compared to the individual constituent models. The combined use of modality-specific knowledge transfer, iterative model pruning, and ensemble learning resulted in improved predictions. We expect that this model can be quickly adopted for COVID-19 screening using chest radiographs.","Rajaraman, Sivaramakrishnan; Siegelman, Jen; Alderson, Philip O.; Folio, Lucas S.; Folio, Les R.; Antani, Sameer K.",,407,16

In particular, cash transfer programmes are currently being adapted or expanded in various low-income and middle-income countries to support individuals and families during the pandemic. We argue that the current crisis offers an opportunity for these programmes to focus on susceptible young people (aged 15-24 years), including those with mental health conditions. Young people living in poverty and with mental health problems are at particular risk of experiencing adverse health, wellbeing, and employment outcomes with long-term consequences. They are also at risk of developing mental health conditions during this pandemic. To support this population, cash transfer programmes should not only address urgent needs around food security and survival but expand their focus to address longer-term mental health impacts of pandemics and economic crises. Such an approach could help support young people's future life chances and break the vicious cycle between mental illness and poverty that spirals many young people into both socioeconomic and mental health disadvantage.","Bauer, Annette; Garman, Emily; McDaid, David; Avendano, Mauricio; Hessel, Philipp; Díaz, Yadira; Araya, Ricardo; Lund, Crick; Malvasi, Paulo; Matijasevich, Alicia; Park, A-La; Paula, Cristiane Silvestre; Ziebold, Carolina; Zimmerman, Annie; Evans-Lacko, Sara",Lancet Psychiatry,407,20

Patients with multiple co-morbidities are more likely to develop these severe forms of the disease. The aim of this report is to highlight cases the analysis of which might help discover factors that influence the course and mortality of COVID-19 pneumonia. The past medical history of our elderly patient (75-year-old female) includes rectum resection with intraoperative cardiac arrest and successful resuscitation. In January 2020, the patient was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon and concomittant pulmonary embolism. Following 6 weeks of therapeutic dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) treatment, the cancerous colonic section was resected. The patient arrested intraoperatively but was successfully resuscitated. On post-operative day 15, the patient developed arterial anastomosis bleed, which necessitated acute right-sided hemicolectomy. Post-operatively she became pyrexial and COVID-19 was confirmed, but later became apyrexial with symptomatic treatment. Subsequently, the patient developed partial anastomosis insufficiency, which resolved with conservative management. Following three negative SARS-CoV-2 tests, she was successfully discharged from hospital. It is worthy of note that due to the active anastomosis bleed the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor treatment was stopped, and later the patient got infected with SARS-CoV-2. A long-lasting LMWH therapy was performed. The timely management of colorectal carcinoms remains important even during an epidemic. The appropriate treatment of these patients during the pandemic presents a great challenge for all doctors, but, as shown in our case report, surgical treatment of even those with multiple co-morbidities can be successful.

These materials can be surface-modified with antibodies, oligonucleotides, and aptamers to enable selective binding with target viruses or their biomarkers in biological samples. Using an external magnetic field, MNM-virus/biomarker complexes can be effectively isolated for further analysis. In some cases, the role of MNMs is not limited to simply serve as magnetic sorbents for extraction purposes as they have become an active part of some emerging detection processes (e.g., the use of magnetoresistive sensors). The combined application of MNMs with microfluidics for virus detection provides promising avenues for diagnostic tests that are of lower cost, require less time, and have higher specificity and sensitivity over conventional tests. This review focuses on the different approaches of virus detection using MNMs integrated in microfluidic chips.

Here we evaluated the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of an inactivated vaccine based on the whole viral particles in human ACE2 transgenic mouse and in non-human primates. Our data showed that the inactivated vaccine successfully induced SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice and non-human primates, and subsequently provided partial (in low dose) or full (in high dose) protection of challenge in the tested animals. In addition, passive serum transferred from vaccine-immunized mice could also provide full protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice.

METHODS: From March 20 to April 8, 319 patients (mean age 62.3 years old) consecutive patients with an intermediate clinical probability of COVID-19 pneumonia underwent a chest CT scan. Two independent chest radiologists blinded to clinical information and RT-PCR results retrospectively reviewed and classified images on a 1-5 confidence level scale for COVID-19 pneumonia. Agreements between radiologists were assessed with kappa statistics. Diagnostic accuracy of chest CT compared with RT-PCR assay and patient outcomes was measured using receiver operating characteristics (ROC). Positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for COVID-19 pneumonia were calculated. RESULTS: Inter-observer agreement for highly probable (kappa: 0.83 [p < .001]) and highly probable or probable (kappa: 0.82 [p < .001]) diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was very good. RT-PCR tests performed in 307 patients were positive in 174 and negative in 133. The areas under the curve (AUC) were 0.94 and 0.92 respectively. With a disease prevalence of 61.2%, PPV were 95.9% and 94.3%, and NPV 84.4% and 77.1%. CONCLUSION: During acute COVID-19 outbreak, chest CT scan may be used for triage of patients with intermediate clinical probability with very good inter-observer agreements and diagnostic accuracy. KEY POINTS: â¢ Concordances between two chest radiologists to diagnose or exclude a COVID-19 pneumonia in 319 consecutive patients with intermediate clinical probability were very good (kappa: 0.82; p < .001). â¢ When compared with RT-PCR results and patient outcomes, the diagnostic accuracy of CT to identify COVID-19 pneumonia was high for both radiologists (AUC: 0.94 and 0.92). â¢ With a disease prevalence of 61.2% in the studied population, the positive predictive values of CT for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia were 95.9% and 94.3% with negative predictive values of 84.4% and 77.1%.","Brun, Anne Laure; Gence-Breney, Alexia; Trichereau, Julie; Ballester, Marie Christine; Vasse, Marc; Chabi, Marie Laure; Mellot, François; Grenier, Philippe A",Eur. radiol,407,16

A total of 81 pacu juveniles (61.7 ± 9.1 g) were exposed to three temperatures (18, 23, and 28 °C), acclimated for a period of 30 days, and then submitted to three levels of dissolved oxygen: control or normoxia (7 mg L-1); moderate hypoxia (4 mg L-1); and severe hypoxia (2 mg L-1) for 12 h. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity, total antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP), and protein thiol content (PSH) and LPO (lipid peroxidation) [measured by the TBARS] were measured in gill, liver, muscle and brain. The results indicated that the interaction between different temperatures and dissolved oxygen levels caused alterations in the antioxidant system and induced lipid and protein damage in pacu juveniles. In addition, the effects were organ specific. In conclusion, exposure to moderate and severe hypoxia affect oxidative stress parameters and have been shown to be organ-specific in pacu juveniles.

Clinical features of COVID-19 include high fever, cough, and fatigue which may progress to ARDS. Respiratory failure can occur rapidly after this. The primary laboratory findings include lymphopenia and eosinopenia. Elevated D-dimer, procalcitonin, and CRP levels may correlate with disease severity. Imaging findings include ground-glass opacities and patchy consolidation on CT scan. Mortality is higher in patients with hypertension, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and COPD. Elderly patients are more susceptible to severe disease and death, while children seem to have lower rates of infection and lower mortality.

Outbreaks in US nursing homes have persisted despite nationwide visitor restrictions beginning in mid-March. An early report issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified staff members working in multiple nursing homes as a likely source of spread from the Life Care Center in Kirkland, WA, to other skilled nursing facilities. The full extent of staff connections between nursing homes-and the role these connections serve in spreading a highly contagious respiratory infection-is currently unknown given the lack of centralized data on cross-facility employment. We perform a large-scale analysis of nursing home connections via shared staff and contractors using device-level geolocation data from 50 million smartphones, and find that 5.1% of smartphone users who visited a nursing home for at least 1 h also visited another facility during our 11-wk study period-even after visitor restrictions were imposed. We construct network measures of connectedness and estimate that nursing homes, on average, share connections with 7.1 other facilities. Traditional federal regulatory metrics of nursing home quality are unimportant in predicting outbreaks, consistent with recent research. Controlling for demographic and other factors, a home's staff network connections and its centrality within the greater network strongly predict COVID-19 cases.","Chen, M Keith; Chevalier, Judith A; Long, Elisa F",Proc.

The patient presented with 5 days of fever, an erythematous maculopapular facial rash, and abdominal pain without respiratory symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction was positive. Despite inpatient treatment for COVID-19 and a perianal abscess, the patient acutely decompensated, with worsening fever, tachycardia, fluid-refractory hypotension, elevation of liver enzymes, and transformation of the rash into purpura extending from the face to the trunk, upper and lower extremities, including the palmar and plantar surfaces of the hands and feet.

Previous studies have shown that indica and japonica varieties varied in machine transplanting efficiency and optimal seeding density. In this study, a RIL population derived from '9311' and 'Nipponbare' were performed to explore the seedling traits variations and the genetic mechanism under three seeding densities. RESULTS: The parents and RIL population exhibited similar trends as the seeding density increased, including seedling height and first leaf sheath length increases, shoot dry weight and root dry weight decreases. Among the 37 QTLs for six traits detected under the three seeding densities, 12 QTLs were detected in both three seeding densities. Five QTL hotspots identified clustered within genomic regions on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 6 and 11. Specific QTLs such as qRDW1.1 and qFLSL5.1 were detected under low and high seeding densities, respectively. Detailed analysis the QTL regions identified under specific seeding densities revealed several candidate genes involved in phytohormones signals and abiotic stress responses. Whole-genome additive effects showed that '9311' contributed more loci enhancing trait performances than 'Nipponbare', indicating '9311' was more sensitive to the seeding density than 'Nipponbare'. The prevalence of negative epistasis effects indicated that the complementary two-locus homozygotes may not have marginal advantages over the means of the two parental genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed the differences between indica rice and japonica rice seedling traits in response to seeding density. Several QTL hotspots involved in different traits and specific QTLs (such as qRDW1.1 and qFLSL5.1) in diverse seeding densities had been detected. Genome-wide additive and two-locus epistasis suggested a dynamic of the genetic control underlying different seeding densities. It was concluded that novel QTLs, additive and epistasis effects under specific seeding density would provide adequate information for rice seedling improvement during machine transplanting.","Zhu, Dan; Zhang, Yuping; Xiang, Jing; Wang, Yaliang; Zhu, Defeng; Zhang, Yikai; Chen, Huizhe",BMC Genet,407,20

Developing a deep learning-based model for automatic COVID-19 diagnosis on chest CT is helpful to counter the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. A weakly-supervised deep learning framework was developed using 3D CT volumes for COVID-19 classification and lesion localization. For each patient, the lung region was segmented using a pre-trained UNet; then the segmented 3D lung region was fed into a 3D deep neural network to predict the probability of COVID-19 infectious; the COVID-19 lesions are localized by combining the activation regions in the classification network and the unsupervised connected components. 499 CT volumes were used for training and 131 CT volumes were used for testing. Our algorithm obtained 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976 PR AUC. When using a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID-positive and COVID-negative, the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive value of 0.840 and a very high negative predictive value of 0.982. The algorithm took only 1.93 seconds to process a single patient's CT volume using a dedicated GPU. Our weakly-supervised deep learning model can accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability and discover lesion regions in chest CT without the need for annotating the lesions for training. The easily-trained and high-performance deep learning algorithm provides a fast way to identify COVID-19 patients, which is beneficial to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. The developed deep learning software is available at https://github.com/sydney0zq/covid-19-detection.","Wang, Xinggang; Deng, Xianbo; Fu, Qing; Zhou, Qiang; Feng, Jiapei; Ma, Hui; Liu, Wenyu; Zheng, Chuansheng",IEEE Trans Med Imaging,407,13

This is the first report of the Italian Society for Cardiac Surgery (SICCH) on preliminary experience with COVID-19 patients receiving ECMO support. Data from 12 Italian hospitals participating in SICCH were retrospectively analyzed. Between March 1 and September 15, 2020, a veno-venous (VV) ECMO system was installed in 67 patients (94%) and a veno-arterio-venous ECMO in four (6%). Five patients required VA ECMO after initial weaning from VV ECMO. Thirty (42.2%) patients were weaned from ECMO, while 39 (54.9%) died on ECMO, and six (8.5%) died after ECMO removal. Overall hospital survival was 36.6% (n = 26). Main causes of death were multiple organ failure (n = 14, 31.1%) and sepsis (n = 11, 24.4%). On multivariable analysis, predictors of death while on ECMO support were older age (p = 0.048), elevated pre-ECMO C-reactive protein level (p = 0.048), higher positive end-expiratory pressure on ventilator (p = 0.036) and lower lung compliance (p = 0.032). If the conservative treatment is not effective, ECMO support might be considered as life-saving rescue therapy for COVID-19 refractory respiratory failure. However warm caution and thoughtful approaches for timely detection and treatment should be taken for such a delicate patients population.","Loforte, Antonio; Di Mauro, Michele; Pellegrini, Carlo; Monterosso, Christian; Pelenghi, Stefano; Degani, Antonella; Rinaldi, Mauro; Cura Stura, Erik; Sales, Gabriele; Montrucchio, Giorgia; Mangino, Domenico; Terrini, Alberto; Pacini, Davide; Affronti, Alessandro; Tarzia, Vincenzo; Bottio, Tomaso; Pantaleo, Antonio; Donatelli, Francesco; Miceli, Antonio; Santini, Francesco; Salsano, Antonio; Colli, Andrea; Ravenni, Giacomo; Montalto, Andrea; Musumeci, Francesco; Salvador, Loris; Gerosa, Gino; Parolari, Alessandro; Picichè, Marco",ASAIO J,407,29

In response, new oxygenation strategies and therapeutics have been developed, but their large-scale effects on outcomes in severe COVID-19 patients remain unknown. Therefore, we aimed to examine the trends in mortality, mechanical ventilation, and cost over the first six months of the pandemic for adult COVID-19 patients in the US who developed ARDS or ARF. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The Vizient Clinical Data Base, a national database comprised of administrative, clinical, and financial data from academic medical centers, was queried for patients &#8805; 18-years-old with COVID-19 and either ARDS or ARF admitted between 3/2020-8/2020. Demographics, mechanical ventilation, length of stay, total cost, mortality, and discharge status were collected. Mann-Kendall tests were used to assess for significant monotonic trends in total cost, mechanical ventilation, and mortality over time. Chi-square tests were used to compare mortality rates between March-May and June-August. 110,223 adult patients with COVID-19 ARDS or ARF were identified. Mean length of stay was 12.1±13.3 days and mean total cost was $35,991±32,496. Mechanical ventilation rates were 34.1% and in-hospital mortality was 22.5%. Mean cost trended downward over time (p = 0.02) from $55,275 (March) to $18,211 (August). Mechanical ventilation rates trended down (p<0.01) from 53.8% (March) to 20.3% (August). Overall mortality rates also decreased (p<0.01) from 28.4% (March) to 13.7% (August). Mortality rates in mechanically ventilated patients were similar over time (p = 0.45), but mortality in patients not requiring mechanical ventilation decreased from March-May compared to June-July (13.5% vs 4.6%, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the outcomes of a large cohort with COVID-19 ARDS or ARF and the subsequent decrease in cost, mechanical ventilation, and mortality over the first 6 months of the pandemic in the US.","Yeates, Eric O; Nahmias, Jeffry; Chinn, Justine; Sullivan, Brittany; Stopenski, Stephen; Amin, Alpesh N; Nguyen, Ninh T",PLoS One,407,24

In traditional epidemiological models such as SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Removed), the exposed group E does not infect the susceptible group S. A distinguishing feature of COVID-19 is that, unlike with previous viruses, there is a distinct ""asymptomatic"" group A, who do not show any symptoms, but can nevertheless infect others, at the same rate as infected patients. This situation is captured in a model known as SAIR (Susceptible, Asymptomatic, Infected, Removed), introduced in Robinson and Stilianakis (2013). The dynamical behavior of the SAIR model is quite different from that of the SEIR model. In this paper, we use Lyapunov theory to establish the global asymptotic stabiilty of the SAIR model. Next, we present methods for estimating the parameters in the SAIR model. We apply these estimation methods to data from several countries including India, and show that the predicted trajectories of the disease closely match actual data.

In addition, the FAO estimates that the number of undernourished people drastically increased by 82–132 million people in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To alleviate this dramatic growth in food insecurity, it is necessary to understand the nature of the increase in the number of malnourished during the pandemic. In order to address this, we gathered and synthesized food-security-related empirical results from the first year of the pandemic in a systematic review. The vast majority (78%) of the 51 included articles reported household food insecurity has increased (access, utilization) and/or disruption to food production (availability) was a result of households having persistently low income and not having an adequate amount of savings. These households could not afford the same quality and/or quantity of food, and a demand shortfall immediately appeared on the producer side. Producers thus had to deal not only with the direct consequences of government measures (disruption in labor flow, lack of demand of the catering sector, etc.) but also with a decline in consumption from low-income households. We conclude that the factor that most negatively affects food security during the COVID-19 pandemic is the same as the deepest structural problem of global food security: low income. Therefore, we argue that there is no need for new global food security objectives, but there is a need for an even stronger emphasis on poverty reduction and raising the wages of low-income households. This structural adjustment is the most fundamental step to recover from the COVID-19 food crises, and to avoid possible future food security crises.","Éliás, Boglárka Anna Jámbor Attila",Sustainability,407,12

Taken together, social isolation and additional psychological impacts of the pandemic (e.g., worry, grief) underscore the importance of intervention efforts to older adults. This narrative review draws upon a wide range of evidence to provide a comprehensive overview of appropriate remotely-delivered interventions for older adults that target loneliness and psychological symptoms. These include interventions delivered by a range of individuals (i.e., community members to mental health professionals), and interventions that vary by implementation (e.g., self-guided therapy, remotely-delivered interventions via telephone or video call).

During the last two decades, three outbreaks of coronavirus-associated pneumonia, namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome, and the ongoing Coronavirus Infectious Disease-2019 (COVID-19) were reported. The rate of diagnosis of viral pneumonia is increasingly approaching 60% among children identified as having community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Clinical presentation ranges from mild to severe pneumonitis complicated by respiratory failure in severe cases. The most vulnerable patients, the elderly and those living with cancer, report a relevant mortality rate. No clinical characteristics can be useful to conclusively distinguish the different etiology of viral pneumonia. However, accessory symptoms, such as anosmia or ageusia together with respiratory symptoms suggest COVID-19. An etiologic-based treatment of viral pneumonia is possible in a small percentage of cases only. Neuraminidase inhibitors have been proven to reduce the need for ventilatory support and mortality rate while only a few data support the large-scale use of other antivirals. A low-middle dose of dexamethasone and heparin seems to be effective in COVID-19 patients, but data regarding their possible efficacy in viral pneumonia caused by other viruses are conflicting. In conclusion, viral pneumonia is a relevant cause of CAP, whose interest is increasing due to the current COVID-19 outbreak. To set up a therapeutic approach is difficult because of the low number of active molecules and the conflicting data bearing supportive treatments such as steroids.","Pagliano, P; Sellitto, C; Conti, V; Ascione, T; Esposito, Silvano",Infection,407,25

This work aimed to define the dynamics of humoral and cell‐mediated immune response in a cohort of health care workers (HCWs) who received a two‐dose BNT162b2‐mRNA vaccination. The serological response was evaluated by quantifying the anti‐RBD and neutralizing antibodies. The cell‐mediated response was performed by a whole blood test quantifying Th1 cytokines (IFN‐γ, TNF‐α, IL‐2), produced in response to spike peptides. The BNT162b2‐mRNA vaccine induced both humoral and cell‐mediated immune responses against spike peptides in virtually all HCWs without previous SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, with a moderate inverse relation with age in the anti‐RBD response. Spike‐specific T cells produced several Th1 cytokines (IFN‐γ, TNF‐α, and IL‐2), which correlated with the specific‐serological response. Overall, our study describes the ability of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to elicit a coordinated neutralizing humoral and spike-specific T cell response in HCWs. Assessing the dynamics of these parameters by an easy immune monitoring protocol can allow for the evaluation of the persistence of the vaccine response in order to define the optimal vaccination strategy. © 2021 by the authors.

Given this, there may be no more important time to focus on staff-patient communication and expression of compassion. However, many of the techniques usually employed by emergency clinicians to provide comfort to patients and their families are made more challenging or impossible by the current circumstances. Geriatric ED patients, who are at increased risk of severe disease, are particularly vulnerable to the effects of isolation. Despite many challenges, emergency clinicians have at their disposal a myriad of tools that can still be used to express compassion and empathy to their patients. Placing emphasis on using these techniques to maximize humanism in the care of COVID-19 patients during this crisis has the potential to bring improvements to ED patient care well after this pandemic has passed.","Sonis, Jonathan D; Kennedy, Maura; Aaronson, Emily L; Baugh, Joshua J; Raja, Ali S; Yun, Bryan J; White, Benjamin A",West J Emerg Med,407,29

We present outcome ('recovered', 'isolated' or 'death') risk estimates of 2019-nCoV over 'early' datasets. A major consideration is the likelihood of death for patients with 2019-nCoV. METHOD: Accounting for the impact of the variations in the reporting rate of 2019-nCoV, we used machine learning techniques (AdaBoost, bagging, extra-trees, decision trees and k-nearest neighbour classifiers) on two 2019-nCoV datasets obtained from Kaggle on March 30, 2020. We used 'country', 'age' and 'gender' as features to predict outcome for both datasets. We included the patient's 'disease' history (only present in the second dataset) to predict the outcome for the second dataset. RESULTS: The use of a patient's 'disease' history improves the prediction of 'death' by more than sevenfold. The models ignoring a patent's 'disease' history performed poorly in test predictions. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate the potential of using a patient's 'disease' history as part of the feature set in machine learning techniques to improve 2019-nCoV predictions. This development can have a positive effect on predictive patient treatment and can result in easing currently overburdened healthcare systems worldwide, especially with the increasing prevalence of second and third wave re-infections in some countries.","Khan, Koffka; Ramsahai, Emilie",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,407,23

Such an anticipated ""tsunami"", with potentially devastating consequences, seems however to not have yet arrived, and African countries, albeit witnessing an increasing degree of autochthonous transmission, seem to this day relatively unaffected by the pandemic.

Small molecules targeting this assembly are being investigated as drug candidates to contrast SARS-CoV-2. In this context, chloroquine, an antimalarial agent proposed as a repurposed drug to treat coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), was hypothesized to bind RBD among its other mechanisms. Similarly, artemisinin and its derivatives are being studied as potential antiviral agents. In this work, we investigated the interaction of artemisinin, its metabolite dihydroartemisinin and chloroquine with RBD by means of computational tools and in vitro. Docking studies showed that the compounds interfere with the same region of the protein and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrated the stability of the predicted complexes. Bio-layer interferometry showed that chloroquine dose-dependently binds RBD (KD = 35.9 µM) more efficiently than artemisinins.","Ribaudo, Giovanni; Coghi, Paolo; Yang, Li Jun; Ng, Jerome P L; Mastinu, Andrea; Memo, Maurizio; Wong, Vincent Kam Wai; Gianoncelli, Alessandra",Nat Prod Res,407,32

But what happened to the companies developing digital services, such as software. Were they interrupted as much or at all? And how has the enforced Working-From-Home mode impacted their ability to continue to deliver software? We hear that some managers are concerned that their engineers are not working effectively from home, or even lack the motivation to work in general, that teams lose touch and that managers do not notice when things go wrong. In this article, we share our findings from monitoring the situation in an international software company with engineers located in Sweden, USA, and the UK. We analyzed different aspects of productivity, such as developer satisfaction and well-being, activity, communication and collaboration, efficiency and flow based on the archives of commit data, calendar invites, and Slack communication, as well as the internal reports of WFH experiences and 18 interviews. We find that company engineers continue committing code and carry out their daily duties without significant disruptions, while their routines have gradually adjusted to the new norm with new emerging practices and various changes to the old ones. In a way, our message is that there is no news, which is good news. Yet, the experiences gained with the WFH of such scale have already made significant changes in the software industry's future, work from anywhere being an example of major importance.","Smite, Darja; Moe, Nils Brede; Klotins, Eriks; Gonzalez-Huerta, Javier",,407,1

Fever, weakness, and dry cough are the main clinical manifestations. However, little is known about neurological symptoms of non-critically ill COVID-19 patients. Objective: To investigate the neurological symptoms and implications of patients with non-critically ill COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: This retrospective cohort study investigated all COVID-19 patients admitted to Wuhan East-West Lake Fangcang shelter hospital. Demographic data, clinical manifestations, comorbidities, radiological data, the result of nucleic acid test, and treatments were collected and analyzed. Results: Among 1,682 patients with confirmed non-critically ill COVID-19, 509 patients (30.3%) had neurological symptoms, including myalgia (311, 18.5%), headache (216, 12.8%), fatigue (83, 4.9%), and dizziness (15, 0.9%). One hundred and fourteen patients (6.8%) were the expansion of pulmonary infection according to their chest CT images and medical history. Compared with patients without neurological symptoms, patients with neurological symptoms had a significantly longer length of hospital stay, time of nucleic acid turning negative, and the mean time from onset of symptom to hospital admission (p &lt; 0.05). Patients with neurological symptoms were more likely to occur the expansion of pulmonary infection compared with the patients without neurological symptoms (46/509 [9.0%] vs. 68/1,173 [5.8%]). Conclusions: Non-critically ill COVID-19 patients commonly have neurological symptoms. Neurological symptoms are significantly associated with the processes of COVID-19. Early identification and aggressive treatment are particularly important for COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms.","Yan, Nao; Xu, Zhipeng; Mei, Bin; Gao, Yongzhe; Lv, Dongwei; Zhang, Junjian",Front.

The system expanded from a small number of occupations, mainly in craft and manufacturing areas, to include many other occupations, notably in the different types of service sectors. The expansion was achieved primarily through a new type of apprenticeship, known as a traineeship, to augment the existing more traditional apprenticeships. Since 2012, the system has contracted considerably, and the participation rate of women has been affected disproportionately. The period of expansion of the system was book-ended by two major government-instigated documents, in 1985 and 2011. In 1985 a Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry into Labour Market Programs proposed the introduction of traineeships, and in 2011 an Expert Panel on Apprenticeships sought to reduce numbers through the application of specific criteria for government support, which primarily affected the occupations served by traineeships. Two sources of evidence are used to examine the expansion and contraction of the apprenticeship system: data from the national apprenticeship statistics collection maintained by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research (NCVER) and key government reports over the 35 years.

Recently, it has been suggested that respiratory damage remains for a long time after recovery from COVID-19. We aimed to clarify the characteristics of radiological and functional lung sequelae of COVID-19 patients described in follow-up period. Method: sPubMed and EMBASE were searched on October 20th, 2020 to investigate characteristics of lung sequelae in COVID-19 patients through retrospective studies according to PRISMA guidelines. Radiological and pulmonary function test (PFT) data were collected and analyzed using one-group meta-analysis in a random-effects model. Results: Our search identified 9 eligible retrospective studies with follow-up period up to 3 months. A total of 581 discharged patients were evaluated by chest CT scans or PFT. The frequency of residual CT abnormalities after hospital discharge was 61.5% ([95% confidential interval (CI)]: [41.3-81.7], I2=96.0%, 243/421 patients). Pulmonary fibrosis and ground glass opacity was found in 42.7% ([95% CI]: [10.4-74.9], I2=96.31%, 56/166 patients) and 42.4% ([95% CI]: [33.3-51.5], I2=43.0%, 107/250) of patients, respectively. The frequency of abnormal pulmonary function test was 39.2% ([95% CI]: [19.8-58.6], I2=79.4%, 48/123 patients) and impaired diffusion capacity was most frequently observed in 32.8% ([95% CI]: [18.2-47.4], I2=86.2%, 93/272 patients) of patients. Restrictive pattern and obstructive pattern were observed in 10.5% ([95% CI]: [6.9-14.0], I2=0%, 31/290 patients) and 4.8% ([95% CI]: [0.9-8.6], I2=45.8%, 14/240 patients), respectively. Conclusion: This systematic review analyzed the frequency of chest CT and PFT abnormalities after hospital discharge. 61.5% and 39.2% of patients had abnormal chest CT and PFT results within a period of 3 months after hospital discharge. The most frequent PFT abnormality was impaired diffusion capacity which is potentially suggestive of residual impact of microthromboembolism in lung vasculature due to hypercoagulability. Further studies with longer follow-up term are warranted to elucidate long term consequences of COVID-19 disease.","So, M.; Kabata, H.; Fukunaga, K.; Takagi, H.; Kuno, T.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,407,1

After the current COVID-19 pandemic, wearing a face mask has been imposed in public places to keep the pandemic under control. However, face occlusion due to wearing a mask presents an emerging challenge for face recognition systems. In this paper, we present a solution to improve the masked face recognition performance. Specifically, we propose the Embedding Unmasking Model (EUM) operated on top of existing face recognition models. We also propose a novel loss function, the Self-restrained Triplet (SRT), which enabled the EUM to produce embeddings similar to these of unmasked faces of the same identities. The achieved evaluation results on three face recognition models, two real masked datasets, and two synthetically generated masked face datasets proved that our proposed approach significantly improves the performance in most experimental settings.","Boutros, Fadi; Damer, Naser; Kirchbuchner, Florian; Kuijper, Arjan",,407,16

Autopsy studies of COVID-19 patients have demonstrated fibrin thrombi in small vessels and capillaries. Increase in proinflammatory cytokines secondary to COVID-19 may play a direct role in creating a prothrombotic state. VTE rates have been described in greater than 20-30% despite prophylactic anticoagulation. There is a paucity of literature describing VTE after hospital discharge in patients with COVID-19. Recommending extended thromboprophylaxis post discharge has been considered in COVID-19 patients at low bleeding risk. We hypothesized that the hypercoagulable state conferred by COVID-19 may last many months following discharge. Methods: We analyzed data from 9 consecutive patients, post diagnosis COVID-19, admitted with acute VTE to two hospitals in the Mount Sinai Health System, New York City. Results: COVID-19: 55.5% patients had COVID-19 that did not require hospitalization. No patients developed VTE. The mean age was 63 years, and 33.3% were female. Risk factors for VTE in addition to recent COVID-19 included obesity (44%), prior VTE (22.2%), active malignancy (11.1%), sickle cell disease (11.1%). Patients hospitalized for the index diagnosis COVID-19 had elevated mean D-dimer (75%) and CRP. Two (50%) patients received corticosteroid therapy. Two patients were discharged on therapeutic anticoagulation for a pre-existing condition. VTE Admission: The mean time of the last positive PCR swab COVID-19 test and admission for VTE was 88 days (SE: 32 days). All patients presented with SOB, 33.3% had a cough. Mean D-dimer level was 6.8 ug/mL (SE: 2.8), of which two had levels above the standard reference range of 20 ug/mL. Five (55.5%), and four (44.4%) patients were classified as Intermediaterisk, and low-risk for mortality, respectively as per ESC guidelines. Two (22.3%) had lower extremity DVT. All were treated with systemic anticoagulation, one patient received catheter directed thrombolysis, and none developed major bleeding during hospitalization. Discharge treatment included DOAC (77.7%), Low Molecular Weight Heparin (11.1%), and coumadin (11.1%). All patients survived to discharge, and there were no major bleeding events. Conclusion: VTE can occur after a significant time following acute COVID-19 in patients hospitalized and those treated as outpatients. The hypercoaguable state conferred by COVID-19 may last many months after the acute illness. Extended VTE prophylaxis should be considered for patients following COVID-19 if the bleeding risk is low, and there are additional independent risk factors for VTE.","Singh, A.; Patel, Y.; Zatakia, J.; Blackwell, L.; Monfasani, A.; Steiger, D.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,407,20

We evaluated the association between preexisting CVD and COVID-19 mortality. Methods: Utilizing deidentified pooled data from 40 healthcare organizations, adult (≥ 18 years) COVID-19 patients were identified based on ICD-10 diagnostic codes and documentation of laboratory positivity for SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antibodies. Among COVID-19 patients, those with documented ICD-10 diagnoses for cerebral infarction / ischemic stroke (IS), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and transient ischemic attack (TIA) at least 30- days before the index COVID-19 event were classified as the CVD group. The CVD and non-CVD groups were propensity score (PS) matched on demographic and comorbidity variables. Pre and post-match risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for 30 and 90-day mortality were calculated. Mortality rates for CVD subgroups (ICH, SAH, AIS, TIA) are also reported. Results: Among a total of 140,034 COVID-19 cases, 4,614 (3.3%) had prevalent CVD. CVD patients were significantly older and were predominantly males of either white or black race (vs. other). CVD patients also had a higher comorbidity burden (vs. non-CVD patients) (graphic). A 1:1 PS algorithm yielded an optimally matched sample of 8,218 COVID-19 patients (4,109 CVD and non-CVD patients each). In the matched sample, 30-day mortality was 8.4% among CVD patients and 7.0% among non-CVD patients RR (CI): 1.20 (1.03 - 1.39). 90-day mortality among CVD patients (vs. Non-CVD patients) remained significantly elevated (9.7% vs. 8.2%), RR (CI): 1.20 (1.04 - 1.37). Among CVD subgroups, 30 and 90-day mortality was higher for patients with preexisting ICH (11.8% and 13.7%, respectively) compared to IS (8.7% and 10.2%, respectively). Conclusion: Preexisting CVD significantly increases the mortality risk in COVID-19 patients. Mechanisms for poor COVID-19 outcomes among CVD patients need to be evaluated.","Meeks, J.; Pan, A.; Potter, T.; Khan, O.; Hooper, D.; Gadhia, R. R.; Misra, V.; Yaghi, S.; Vahidy, F. S.",Stroke,407,1

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of telework has increased due to COVID-19. The upsurge brings with it challenges, including limited face-to-face interaction with colleagues and supervisors, reduced access to ergonomics information and resources, increased social isolation, and blurred role definitions, which may adversely affect teleworker safety, health, and well-being. METHOD: Evidence-based strategies for improving occupational safety, health, and well-being among teleworkers were synthesized in a narrative-based review to address common challenges associated with telework considering circumstances unique to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Interventions aimed at increasing worker motivation to engage in safe and healthy behaviors via enhanced safety leadership, managing role boundaries to reduce occupational safety and health risks, and redesigning work to strengthen interpersonal interactions, interdependence, as well as workers' initiation have been supported in the literature.

DESIGN: Multicenter observational cohort study. SETTINGS: Acute medical units in four Italian hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 516 patients (median age 78 years) admitted to the participating centers with SARS-CoV-2 infection from February 22 to May 17, 2020. MEASUREMENTS: Comprehensive medical assessment with detailed history, physical examinations, functional status, laboratory and imaging procedures. On admission, delirium was determined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th edition) criteria, 4AT, m-Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, or clinical impression depending on the site. The primary outcomes were delirium rates and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Overall, 73 (14.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 11.0-17.3%) patients presented delirium on admission. Factors significantly associated with delirium were dementia (odds ratio, OR = 4.66, 95% CI = 2.03-10.69), the number of chronic diseases (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.03; 1.40), and chest X-ray or CT opacity (OR = 3.29, 95% CI = 1.12-9.64 and 3.35, 95% CI = 1.07-10.47, for multiple or bilateral opacities and single opacity vs no opacity, respectively). There were 148 (33.4%) in-hospital deaths in the no-delirium group and 43 (58.9%) in the delirium group (P-value assessed using the Gray test <.001). As assessed by a multivariable Cox model, patients with delirium on admission showed an almost twofold increased hazard ratio for in-hospital mortality with respect to patients without delirium (hazard ratio = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.25-2.83).

Relying on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for identifying infected individuals may result in missed cases. Screening for antibodies after an outbreak can help to find missed cases and better illuminate routes of transmission. METHODS: In this study, we present the results of a serological screening of the healthcare workers (HCWs) on a ward for infectious diseases in Sweden with a point-of-care antibody test 8 weeks after an outbreak of COVID-19. In all, 107/123 (87%) of HCWs who were tested with RT-PCR in the outbreak investigation participated in this study on seroprevalence. Participants were also asked to fill out a questionnaire entailing epidemiological data. The cohort was stratified by RT-PCR result and the resulting groups were compared to each other. RESULTS: Six (8%) HCWs who were tested RT-PCR negative during the outbreak investigation had developed specific IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These HCWs had all worked shifts with colleagues who later were tested RT-PCR positive during the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that a serological follow-up screening after an outbreak may be used as a complement to virus detection in an outbreak situation. However, immunoglobulin (Ig) G-detection should also be performed at the start of an outbreak, to facilitate interpretation of the results.","Strand, Rasmus; Fernström, Nils; Holmberg, Anna; De Marinis, Yang; Fraenkel, Carl-Johan; Rasmussen, Magnus",Infect Dis (Lond),407,29

The infection may result in severe pneumonia with clusters of illness onsets. Its impacts on public health make it paramount to clarify the clinical features with other pneumonias. METHODS: Nineteen COVID-19 and 15 other patients with pneumonia (non-COVID-19) in areas outside of Hubei were involved in this study. Both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients were confirmed to be infected using throat swabs and/or sputa with/without COVID-2019 by real-time RT-PCR. We analyzed the demographic, epidemiological, clinical, and radiological features from those patients, and compared the differences between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19. RESULTS: All patients had a history of exposure to confirmed cases of COVID-19 or travel to Hubei before illness. The median (IQR) duration was 8 (6-11) and 5 (4-11) days from exposure to onset in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases, respectively. The clinical symptoms were similar between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19. The most common symptoms were fever and cough. Fifteen (78.95%) COVID-19 but 4 (26.67%) non-COVID-19 patients had bilateral involvement while 17 COVID-19 patients (89.47%) but 1 non-COVID-19 patient (6.67%) had multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity on chest CT images.

Caring for patients who have AN is particularly challenging for nursing staff, who are on the front line and have the closest contact with patients. However, little is known about how nursing staff care for adolescent patients with AN in Taiwan. This study aimed to explore nurses' perceptions on and experiences in conflict situations in caring for adolescents with AN. A qualitative study approach was conducted. Through semi-structured interviews, ten nursing staff from the paediatric ward at a university-affiliated medical centre in central Taiwan shared their experiences. Recorded interviews were transcribed and analysed by content analysis. This analysis identified three themes with eight subthemes: (i) struggling to develop therapeutic relationships, (ii) selective focusing, and (iii) difficulty changing minds. The findings of this study indicated a need for ongoing support for nursing staff, the development of therapeutic relationships with adolescent patients with AN, extensive nursing staff preparation, and the development of in-service training programs to enable nursing staff to care for these patients with greater understanding.","Wu, Wan-Ling; Chen, Shu-Ling",Int. j. ment. health nurs,407,3

Materials and Methods: In this survey study, an online questionnaire consisting of 40 questions was directed to actively working ophthalmologists. The questions asked about demographic characteristics, working conditions and schedule, follow-up of ophthalmology patients, and levels of knowledge and anxiety about the pandemic. Results: This study included 161 ophthalmologists (78 women and 83 men). They were predominantly consultant ophthalmologists (71%), with 128 living in metropolitan areas. More than half (54.4%) reported decreased weekly working hours, 52.5% were attending routine outpatient clinics, 52.8% were working in COVID-19-related units, 67.1% were performing only emergency operations, and 52% reported disrupted follow-up of chronic eye patients. Sixty-four percent thought that ophthalmologists were in the high-risk group, and nearly all participants used masks while working (99%). Additionally, 91% expressed high anxiety regarding the pandemic, most commonly due to the risk of transmitting the disease to family (83%), and 12.5% considered their level of knowledge about the pandemic to be insufficient. Forty-six percent of the participants thought that daily life conditions would normalize in 2 to 5 months. Conclusion: Close proximity during patient examination causes ophthalmologists concern about their risk. The increasing number of COVID-19 cases resulted in a proportional decrease in the number of patients and surgeries in ophthalmology clinics in our country. As a result, ophthalmologists are unwillingly appointed to high-risk units. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a substantial increase in anxiety levels among Turkish ophthalmologists.","Kavadarli, Isilay; Mutlu, Melek",Turk J Ophthalmol,407,25

Identifying risk factors for isolation of MDROs is critical to COVID-19 treatment. METHODS: All eligible adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia from 10 hospitals in the Republic of Korea between February 2020 and May 2020 were retrospectively enrolled. Using this cohort, epidemiology and risk factors for isolation of MDROs were evaluated. RESULTS: Of 152 patients, 47 with microbial culture results were included. Twenty isolates of MDROs from 13 (28%) patients were cultured. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (5 isolates) was the most common MDRO, followed by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (4 isolates). MDROs were mostly isolated from sputum samples (80%, 16/20). The median time from hospitalization to MDRO isolation was 28 days (interquartile range, 18-38 days). In-hospital mortality was higher in patients with MDRO isolation (62% vs 15%; P = .001). Use of systemic corticosteroids after diagnosis of COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 15.07; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.34-97.01; P = .004) and long-term care facility (LTCF) stay before diagnosis of COVID-19 (aOR: 6.09; 95% CI: 1.02-36.49; P = .048) were associated with MDRO isolation. CONCLUSIONS: MDROs were isolated from 28% of COVID-19 pneumonia patients with culture data and 8.6% of the entire cohort. Previous LTCF stay and adjunctive corticosteroid use were risk factors for the isolation of MDROs. Strict infection prevention strategies may be needed in these COVID-19 patients with risk factors.","Son, Hyo-Ju; Kim, Tark; Lee, Eunjung; Park, Se Yoon; Yu, Shinae; Hong, Hyo-Lim; Kim, Min-Chul; Hong, Sun In; Bae, Seongman; Kim, Min Jae; Kim, Sung-Han; Yun, Ji Hyun; Jo, Kyeong Min; Lee, Yu-Mi; Lee, Seungjae; Park, Jung Wan; Jeon, Min Hyok; Kim, Tae Hyong; Choo, Eun Ju",Am. j. infect. control,407,1

We analyzed data from undergraduate and graduate students (N = 502) at an urban private university in the Western United States. An online survey was conducted to assess ACEs and BCEs, current stress and social support, depressive and anxiety symptoms, perceived stress, and loneliness in May 2020. Higher levels of ACEs were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms, ß = 0.45, p = 0.002.

Infection despite full vaccination (vaccine breakthrough) has been reported, but characteristics of those with vaccine breakthrough resulting in hospitalization and relative rates of hospitalization in unvaccinated and vaccinated persons are not well described, including during late June and July 2021 when the highly transmissible Delta variant predominated. MethodsFrom January 1-June 30, 2021, cases defined as adults aged [≥]18 years with laboratory-confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were identified from >250 acute care hospitals in the population-based COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET). Through chart review for sampled cases, we examine characteristics associated with vaccination breakthrough. From January 24-July 24, 2021, state immunization information system data linked to both >37,000 cases representative cases and the defined surveillance catchment area population were used to compare weekly hospitalization rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Unweighted case counts and weighted percentages are presented. ResultsFrom January 1 - June 30, 2021, fully vaccinated cases increased from 1 (0.01%) to 321 (16.1%) per month. Among 4,732 sampled cases, fully vaccinated persons admitted with COVID-19 were older compared with unvaccinated persons (median age 73 years [Interquartile Range (IQR) 65-80] v. 59 years [IQR 48-70]; p<0.001), more likely to have 3 or more underlying medical conditions (201 (70.8%) v. 2,305 (56.1%), respectively; p<0.001) and be residents of long-term care facilities [37 (14.5%) v. 146 (5.5%), respectively; p<0.001]. From January 24 - July 24, 2021, cumulative hospitalization rates were 17 times higher in unvaccinated persons compared with vaccinated persons (423 cases per 100,000 population v. 26 per 100,000 population, respectively); rate ratios were 23, 22 and 13 for those aged 18-49, 50-64, and [≥]65 years respectively. For June 27 - July 24, hospitalization rates were [≥]10 times higher in unvaccinated persons compared with vaccinated persons for all age groups across all weeks. ConclusionPopulation-based hospitalization rates show that unvaccinated adults aged [≥]18 years are 17 times more likely to be hospitalized compared with vaccinated adults. Rates are far higher in unvaccinated persons in all adult age groups, including during a period when the Delta variant was the predominant strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Central to these instructions is the selection of the underlying cause of death for a public health preventive purpose. This article focuses on two rules for this selection: (1) that a death due to COVID-19 should be counted independently of pre-existing conditions that are suspected of triggering a severe course of COVID-19 and (2) that COVID-19 should not be considered as due to anything else. The article argues that observance of the first rule may not always lead to an optimal selection from a preventive point of view and that in the future the ascertainment of an animal source of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) would make it possible to reconceptualize 'COVID-19' and create a zoonotic classification code by means of which a factor of a greater preventive value could be selected than what is currently possible.,"Lindahl, B I B",Hist Philos Life Sci,407,16

Methods PubMed, EMbase, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP and WanFang Data databases were electronically searched to collect studies on clinical characteristics of pregnant females and juveniles with MERS from inception to February 15th, 2020. Two reviewers independently screened literature, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. Descriptive analysis was then performed. Results A total of 12 studies involving 12 pregnant females, and 21 juveniles with MERS were included. The results of studies showed that the male to female ratio of juveniles patients was 1 to 1.63 and the age ranged from 9 months to 16 years. The primary transmission route of juveniles cases was family contact infection, accounting for 57.1% (12/21). Asymptomatic juveniles accounted for 57.1% (12/21), and the most common symptoms were fever, cough and shortness of breath. Some patients exhibited gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea. The positive rate of MERS-CoV RCT test was 100.0% (21/21). As for chest radiograph, 73.7% (14/19) cases showed no obvious lesions, and juveniles with lesions were mainly bilateral. 3 patients with underlying diseases developed severe cases, the mortality was 9.5% (2/21). The age range of pregnant women was 27 to 39, with the gestational age from 6 to 38 weeks. The primary transmission route for pregnant women was nosocomial infection, accounting for 57.1% (4/7). Fever, cough, shortness of breath were common manifestations, while abdominal pain occurred in two female patients. The positive rate of MERS-CoV RCT test was 100.0% (11/11). The chest radiograph findings were mainly bilateral lesions, accounting for 55.6% (5/9). 80.0% of whole pregnant females were severe cases (8/10), 4 of them died, with the 50.0% (4/8) mortality in severe pregnant cases. Among the infective pregnant women, 2 were stillborn and 10 were delivered, of which 1 died due to premature delivery. The remaining 9 surviving newborns were not infected with MERS-CoV and there was no evidence of mother-to-child transmission. Conclusions The clinical symptoms of MERS in juveniles are similar to those in adults, however, considerably milder. Severe case rate is higher in patients with underlying diseases. However, maternal infections could be much severe with higher mortality. It is particularly important to strengthen the management of pregnant females, especially prevent hospital infection. There is still no evidence of MERS-CoV mother-to-child transmission.","He, Yang; Tang, Jun; Zhang, Meng; Zeng, Yan; Yue, Yan; Li, Wenxing; Hu, Peng; Xiong, Tao; Mu, Dezhi; Li, Youping",Chin. J.

The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of potential adverse drug events (ADE) associated with drugs repurposed for COVID-19 treatment in a large-scale population. Drug claims were used to calculate a baseline medication risk score (MRS) indicative of ADE risk level. Fictitious claims of repurposed drugs were added, one at a time, to patients' drug regimens to calculate a new MRS and compute a level of risk. Drug claims data from enrollees with Regence health insurance were used and sub-payer analyses were performed with Medicare and Commercial insured groups. Simulated interventions were conducted with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, alone or combined with azithromycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir, along with terfenadine and fexofenadine as positive and negative controls for drug-induced Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). 527,471 subjects (56.6% female; mean [SD] age, 47 [21]) were studied. The simulated addition of each repurposed drug caused an increased risk of ADEs (median MRS increased by two-to-seven points, p<0.001). The increase in ADE risk was mainly driven by an increase in CYP450 drug interaction risk score and by drug-induced LQTS risk score. The Medicare group presented a greater risk overall compared to Commercial group. All repurposed drugs were associated with an increased risk of ADEs. Our simulation strategy could be used as a blueprint to assess preemptively safety associated with future repurposed or new drugs.","Smith, Matt K; Bikmetov, Ravil; Al Rihani, Sweilem B; Deodhar, Malavika; Hafermann, Matthew; Dow, Pamela; Turgeon, Jacques; Michaud, Veronique",Clinical and translational science (Online),407,24

Investigation of pattern in the occurrence of COVID-19, to check the influence of different meteorological factors on the incidence of COVID-19 and prediction of incidence of COVID-19 are the objectives of this paper. METHODS: For trend analysis, Sen's Slope and Man-Kendall test have been used, Generalized Additive Model (GAM) of regression has been used to check the influence of different meteorological factors on the incidence and to predict the frequency of COVID-19, and Verhulst (Logistic) Population Model has been used. RESULTS: Statistically significant linear trend found for the daily-confirmed cases of COVID-19. The regression analysis indicates that there is some influence of the interaction of average temperature (AT) and average relative humidity (ARH) on the incidence of COVID-19. However, this result is not consistent throughout the study area. The projections have been made up to 21st May, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Trend and regression analysis give an idea of the incidence of COVID-19 in India while projection made by Verhulst (Logistic) Population Model for the confirmed cases of the study area are encouraging as the sample prediction is as same as the actual number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.","Goswami, Kuldeep; Bharali, Sulaxana; Hazarika, Jiten",Diabetes Metab Syndr,407,20

Methods: We considered studies with cross-sectional and longitudinal designs as well as interventional or observational studies correlating pain scores with measures derived from wearable devices. A search was also performed on studies that investigated physical activity and physiometric signals among patients with pain. Results: Few studies have assessed the possibility of incorporating wearable devices as objective tools for contextualizing pain and physical function in free-living environments. Of the studies that have been conducted, most focus solely on physical activity and functional outcomes as measured by a wearable accelerometer. Several studies report promising correlations between pain scores and signals derived from wearable devices, objectively measured physical activity, and physical function. In addition, there is a known association between physiologic signals that can be measured by wearable devices and pain, though studies using wearable devices to measure these signals and associate them with pain in free-living environments are limited. Conclusion: There exists a great opportunity to study the complex interplay between physiometric signals, physical function, and pain in a real-time fashion in free-living environments. The literature supports the hypothesis that wearable devices can be used to develop reproducible biosignals that correlate with pain. The combination of wearable devices and EMA will likely lead to the development of clinically meaningful endpoints that will transform how we understand and treat pain patients.","Leroux, Andrew Rzasa-Lynn Rachael Crainiceanu Ciprian Sharma Tushar",Digital Biomarkers,407,33

We aimed to assess the experience of patients with IBD during the COVID-19 lockdown. DESIGN: We designed a survey focused on the impact of COVID-19 on IBD healthcare, social and psychological well-being and quality of life. To capture those most likely to be affected we targeted survey invitations at our British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) defined high and moderate-risk IBD population. Access to the survey was also available via our trust's social media pages. RESULTS: 685 responses were received. 76% of respondents categorised themselves in BSG defined moderate or high-risk groups, requiring stringent social distancing or shielding. 87% did not change their IBD medication, with most reported changes initiated by the IBD team. 39% were worried about their IBD care, but most services were largely uninterrupted. 90% received 'at-risk' notification often from multiple sources, but 17% not until May. The majority reported a negative impact of COVID-19 on their quality of life and significantly increased perceived stress. Patients expressed a strong wish of having future care delivered remotely. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has had a significant negative impact on psychological well-being of patients with IBD. Local IBD services must have a robust data set of vulnerable patients and be designated future responsibility for prompt communication of advice to avoid delayed and sometimes conflicting information. Remote patient management systems should be further developed and embedded in clinical practice.","Harris, Richard James; Downey, Louise; Smith, Trevor R; Cummings, J R Fraser; Felwick, Richard; Gwiggner, Markus",,407,16

This new disease, due to its large diffusion, may significantly hamper the prognosis of other pathologies, such as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) because of (a) a possible direct negative impact and (b) shortage of first response medical resources and increased delays to reperfusion. We report the case of a 68-year-old man admitted for anterior STEMI and asymptomatic COVID-19. Due to extended transportation delays to a cathlab, he received intravenous fibrinolytic therapy, which failed. Reperfusion was achieved with rescue coronary angioplasty, but the patient experienced two episodes of acute stent thrombosis at 2- and 36-hr following admission and despite optimal medical therapy. He finally died because of cardiogenic shock. This raises concerns about a possible increase in platelet aggregability associated with COVID-19 leading to an increased risk of stent thrombosis, particularly in the context of STEMI. This pleads for the promotion of primary coronary angioplasty as the first-choice revascularization technique in this population and the use of new generation P2Y12 inhibitors. In addition, the use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors may be considered in every STEMI patient with COVID-19 to prevent the risk of acute stent thrombosis.","Lacour, Thibaud; Semaan, Carl; Genet, Thibaud; Ivanes, Fabrice",Catheter. cardiovasc. interv,407,16

In response to the rising number of coronavirus cases in the United Kingdom, the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) issued a series of emergency guidelines for the management of trauma and orthopedic patients during the pandemic. In line with this guidance, the orthopedic team at the Worcestershire Royal Hospital set up a 'one-stop-shop' minor injuries unit (MIU). This seven-day service provided a direct pathway to the trauma clinic for ambulatory patients who would usually be managed in the emergency department (ED), intending to reduce both the pressure on the ED and the need for further follow-up appointments. The aim of this project was to evaluate the service provided to patients and to inform our practice during the next stages of the pandemic and beyond. Materials and methods: Data were collected retrospectively from a clinic database, dictated letters, and scanned patient notes. The data collection period was over six weeks from April 6, 2020 to May 18, 2020. Data collected included patient age and gender, time of arrival and departure, grade of reviewing clinician, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of clinic attendance, including the timing of follow-up. Results: Some 700 patients were seen in the MIU over six weeks. Some 98% of patients were seen by an orthopedic registrar (resident) or a consultant (attending) and 85% were seen and treated within an hour. Some 71% of patients were discharged after their initial appointment, and only nine patients (1%) required a fracture clinic appointment within 72 hours. A total of 15 patients (2%) re-attended with concerns, and just four of these required additional interventions. Conclusions: We delivered a seven-day minor injuries service in which the majority of patients received definitive management at first attendance, reducing the demand for fracture clinic appointments. Some 700 patients who would have been treated in the ED were seen in the MIU instead, relieving pressure on the ED. The lessons learned allowed us to plan for the 'second peak' in COVID-19 cases and will inform ongoing practice as we work to recover elective services.","Howles, S.

Although it is commonly assumed that homeostasis modulates synaptic strength, membrane excitability, and firing rates, its role at the neural circuit and network level is unknown. Here, we identify changes in higher-order network properties of freely behaving rodents during prolonged visual deprivation. Strikingly, our data reveal that functional pairwise correlations and their structure are subject to homeostatic regulation. Using a computational model, we demonstrate that the interplay of different plasticity and homeostatic mechanisms can capture the initial drop and delayed recovery of firing rates and correlations observed experimentally. Moreover, our model indicates that synaptic scaling is crucial for the recovery of correlations and network structure, while intrinsic plasticity is essential for the rebound of firing rates, suggesting that synaptic scaling and intrinsic plasticity can serve distinct functions in homeostatically regulating network dynamics.","Wu, Yue Kris; Hengen, Keith B; Turrigiano, Gina G; Gjorgjieva, Julijana",Proc.

In this study, the aim was to identify factors associated with headache in COVID-19 and headache characteristics. METHODS: This case-control study includes COVID-19 hospitalized patients with pneumonia during March 2020. Controls comprise COVID-19 patients without headache and the cases are COVID-19 patients with headache. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were obtained from the medical records. Headache characteristics were evaluated by semi-structured telephonic interview after discharge. RESULTS: Of a total of 379 COVID-19 patients, 48 (13%) developed headache. Amongst these, 30 (62%) were men and the median age was 57.9 (47-73) years. Headache was associated with younger age, fewer comorbidities and reduced mortality, as well as with low levels of C-reactive protein, mild acute respiratory distress syndrome and oropharyngeal symptoms. A logistic multiple regression model revealed that headache was directly associated with D-dimer and creatinine levels, the use of high flow nasal cannula and arthromyalgia, whilst urea levels, beta-lactamic treatment and hypertension were negatively associated with headache. COVID-19-associated headache characteristics were available for 23/48 (48%) patients. Headache was the onset symptom in 8/20 (40%) patients, of mild or moderate intensity in 17/20 (85%) patients, with oppressive characteristics in 17/18 (94%) and of holocranial 8/19 (42%) or temporal 7/19 (37%) localization. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that headache is associated with a more benign SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19-associated headache appears as an early symptom and as a novel headache with characteristics of headache attributed to systemic viral infection. Further research addressing the underlying mechanisms to confirm these findings is warranted.","Gonzalez-Martinez, Alicia; Fanjul, Víctor; Ramos, Carmen; Serrano Ballesteros, Jorge; Bustamante, Marta; Villa Martí, Almudena; Álvarez, Claudia; García Del Álamo, Yaiza; Vivancos, José; Gago-Veiga, Ana Beatriz",Eur. j. neurol,407,13

However, there is paucity of research on the agent aspect of catastrophe in the eco-pedagogy literature. This article addresses this gap by reconceptualizing the possibility of uncertain disasters in building individual human capacity within the framework of the Chinese ‘change’ philosophy. Recognizing that tien-rén-hé-yi (i.e., the harmony between humanity and nature) is the tagline of Chinese ecological philosophy, we further argue that such harmony can only be achieved with an understanding of the philosophy of ‘change’. As a form of devastating, emotional, irrational, systematic, and usually irreversible movements, catastrophes may trigger change at the creative level, which goes beyond the repetitive ‘cyclic’ motion. Such transformative characteristics of catastrophes elicit new forms of learning that are defined by discontinuity and resilience. Contemporary catastrophe education can encourage successive generations in their shaping of a symbiotic model rather than a more confining framework, thus involving human beings and the environment by thinking beyond the limits of instrumental approaches or problem solving.","Chen, Hongyan; Peng, Zhengmei",Educ.Philos.

For example, past work has asked if individuals in more socially cohesive neighborhoods have better mental health outcomes. Despite the ubiquity of use, it is relatively rare for contextual studies to employ the methods of network analysis. This is the case, in part, because network data are difficult to collect, requiring information on all ties between all actors. This paper asks whether it is possible to avoid such heavy data collection while still retaining the best features of a contextual-network study. The basic idea is to apply network sampling to the problem of contextual models, where one uses sampled ego network data to infer the network features of each context, and then uses the inferred network features as second-level predictors in a hierarchical linear model. We test the validity of this idea in the case of network cohesion. Using two complete datasets as a test, we find that ego network data are sufficient to capture the relationship between cohesion and important outcomes, like attachment and deviance. The hope, going forward, is that researchers will find it easier to incorporate holistic network measures into traditional regression models.","Smith, Jeffrey A; Gauthier, G Robin",Sociol Methodol,407,19

Since these countries implemented different COVID-19 intervention strategies, they provide a natural laboratory for examining how COVID-19 policies and mitigation strategies affected the propagation, evolution and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We explored how the duration, the size and number of transmission clusters, defined as country-specific monophyletic groups in a SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree, differed between the Nordic countries. We found that Sweden had the largest number of COVID-19 transmission clusters followed by Denmark, Norway, Finland and Iceland. Moreover, Sweden and Denmark had the largest, and most enduring, transmission clusters followed by Norway, Finland and Iceland. In addition, there was a significant positive association between transmission cluster size and duration, suggesting that the size of transmission clusters could be reduced by rapid and effective contact tracing. Thus, these data indicate that to reduce the general burden of COVID-19 there should be a focus on limiting dense gatherings and their subsequent contacts to keep the number, size and duration of transmission clusters to a minimum. Our results further suggest that although geographical connectivity, population density and openness influence the spread and the size of SARS-CoV-2 transmission clusters, country-specific intervention strategies had the largest single impact.","Duchene, Sebastian; Featherstone, Leo; Blasio, Birgitte Freiesleben de; Holmes, Edward C; Bohlin, Jon; Pettersson, John H.-O.",,407,17

It is unclear whether abnormal liver chemistries can predict the severity of COVID-19. Therefore, we compared the serum liver chemistries such as hepatic transaminases, total bilirubin, albumin, and prothrombin time to evaluate whether they can predict severity and mortality in COVID-19. Methods: An electronic search was performed on PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, and Google Scholar for studies comparing liver chemistries in severe and mild COVID-19. The literature search was performed using keywords “COVID-19,” “Liver,” Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST),” and “Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT),” “AST,” and “ALT,” in various combinations of “AND/OR” from December 1, 2019, till May 8, 2020. The pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each component of liver chemistries. Results: Twenty-two studies were eligible, with 3,256 patients (54.57% males). Seventeen studies compared liver chemistries for severe vs. mild COVID-19, whereas five studies compared liver chemistries in survival vs. non-survival groups. The pooled WMD of AST and ALT in severe vs. mild COVID-19 were 12.23 (95% CI; 8.07, 16.39; p &lt; 0.01) and 8.07 (95% CI 2.55, 11.91; p &lt; 0.01), respectively.

Conclusion: Our meta-analysis shows that deranged liver chemistries may indicate severe COVID-19 and could also predict mortality. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the relationship between derangement in liver chemistries and mortality in COVID-19.","Boregowda, Umesha; Aloysius, Mark M.; Perisetti, Abhilash; Gajendran, Mahesh; Bansal, Pardeep; Goyal, Hemant",Front.

As-prepared flexible electromagnetic manipulator can reach maximum velocity of 8.1m/s and acceleration of 627m/s2 respectively at an applied voltage of 360V. The working mechanism of this flexible electromagnetic manipulator has been studied based on the Maxwell and Abaqus simulation. Diverse parameters, including the length of magnetic tube (the cylindrical magnet) and the whole manipulators and applied voltage values, have been considered to tune the ejecting performances of the manipulators. Furthermore, flexible electromagnetic manipulators can be upgraded to capture various objects by attaching a mechanical force triggered gripper to their top pads. With this design, the velocity of gripper can be significantly improved(the maximum velocity of this is 8.1m/s. However, the soft gripper in the previous research does not have the characteristics of fast movement ), thus making it possible to get objects without approaching them, in another word, we can catch objects even though they are far away from us ,which provide a possibility of long-distance capture.We believe this kind of bio-inspired fabrication is a powerful strategy to design and synthesize flexible even stretchable manipulators, extending the boundaries of conventional manipulators for soft robots.","Kan, Longxin; Lei, Fengxiao; Song, Bo; Su, Bin; Shi, Yusheng",Bioinspiration biomim,407,26

In this paper, we show that good generalization to unseen sources has not been achieved. Experiments with richer data sets than have previously been used show models have high accuracy on seen sources, but poor accuracy on unseen sources. The reason for the disparity is that the convolutional neural network model, which learns features, can focus on differences in X-ray machines or in positioning within the machines, for example. Any feature that a person would clearly rule out is called a confounding feature. Some of the models were trained on COVID-19 image data taken from publications, which may be different than raw images. Some data sets were of pediatric cases with pneumonia where COVID-19 chest X-rays are almost exclusively from adults, so lung size becomes a spurious feature that can be exploited. In this work, we have eliminated many confounding features by working with as close to raw data as possible. Still, deep learned models may leverage source specific confounders to differentiate COVID-19 from pneumonia preventing generalizing to new data sources (i.e. external sites). Our models have achieved an AUC of 1.00 on seen data sources but in the worst case only scored an AUC of 0.38 on unseen ones. This indicates that such models need further assessment/development before they can be broadly clinically deployed. An example of fine-tuning to improve performance at a new site is given.

However no human population is fully isolated from other human or animal populations. We use compartmental models to derive simple rules for the basic reproduction number for populations with local person-to-person transmission and exposure from some other source: either a reservoir exposure or imported cases. We introduce the idea of a reservoir-driven or importation-driven disease: diseases that would become extinct in the population of interest without reservoir exposure or imported cases (since $R_0<1$), but nevertheless may be sufficiently transmissible that many or most infections are acquired from humans in that population. We show that in the simplest case, $R_0<1$ if and only if the proportion of infections acquired from the external source exceeds the disease prevalence and explore how population heterogeneity and the interactions of multiple strains affect this rule. We apply these rules in two cases studies of Clostridium difficile infection and colonisation: C. difficile in the hospital setting accounting for imported cases, and C. difficile in the general human population accounting for exposure to animal reservoirs. We demonstrate that even the hospital-adapted, highly-transmissible NAP1/RT027 strain of C. difficile had a reproduction number<1 in a landmark study of hospitalised patients and therefore was sustained by colonised and infected admissions to the study hospital. We argue that C. difficile should be considered reservoir-driven if as little as 13.0% of transmission can be attributed to animal reservoirs.","McLure, Angus; Glass, Kathryn",,407,3

Secondary aims were to assess whether length of time on the waiting list influenced quality of life and rate of deferral of surgery. METHODS: During the study period (August and September 2020) 843 patients (THA n = 394, KA n = 449) from ten centres in the UK reported their EuroQol five dimension (EQ-5D) scores and completed a waiting list questionnaire (2020 group). Patient demographic details, procedure, and date when listed were recorded. Patients scoring less than zero for their EQ-5D score were defined to be in a health state ""worse than death"" (WTD). Data from a retrospective cohort (January 2014 to September 2017) were used as the control group. RESULTS: The 2020 group had a significantly worse EQ-5D score compared to the control group for both THA (p < 0.001) and KA (p < 0.001). Over one-third (35.0%, n = 138/394) of patients waiting for a THA and nearly a quarter (22.3%, n = 100/449) for KA were in a health state WTD, which was significantly greater than the control group (odds ratio 2.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.83 to 2.93) and 2.08 (95% CI 1.61 to 2.70), respectively; p < 0.001). Over 80% (n = 680/843) of the 2020 group felt that their quality of life had deteriorated while waiting. Each additional month spent on the waiting list was independently associated with a decrease in quality of life (EQ-5D: -0.0135, p = 0.004). There were 117 (13.9%) patients who wished to defer their surgery and the main reason for this was health concerns for themselves and or their family (99.1%, n = 116/117). CONCLUSION: Over one-third of patients waiting for THA and nearly one-quarter waiting for a KA were in a state WTD, which was approaching double that observed prior to the pandemic.

Therefore, a method that can convert 3Q into a substrate with enhanced detectability by GC-MS would be an important tool in its analysis. METHODS: 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl chloride (TrocCl) was used in the derivatization of 3Q in three different soils of varying composition and total organic content (Virginia Type A soil, Nebraska EPA standard soil and Ottawa sand) when present at a 10 µg·g-1 concentration in each. A direct derivatization protocol and one involving the pre-extraction of the analyte were evaluated for their individual efficiencies and subsequent analysis by EI-GC-MS. RESULTS: The practical derivatization of 3Q, when present at low levels (10 µg·g-1 ) in three different soil matrices was found to be rapid (1 hour) and to smoothly take place at ambient temperature (and as low as 4 o C). The method detection limit (MDL) was determined to be 30 ng·mL-1 for the Virginia type A soil, 49 ng·mL-1 for the Nebraska EPA standard soil and 72 ng·mL-1 for the Ottawa sand sample. CONCLUSIONS: An expedient and practical derivatization method for 3Q, a chemical warfare degradation product difficult to detect by GC-MS, has been accomplished using trichloroethyl chloroformate. The reaction provides 3Q-Troc, a derivative with superior detectability than 3Q by EI-GC-MS such as peak sharpness and a unique mass spectrum for its unambiguous identification.","Valdez, Carlos A; Leif, Roald N; Vu, Alexander K; Salazar, Edmund P",Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom,407,24

Por ello, se debe trabajar en lazos de confianza y comunicación. Por otro lado, en el período de cuarentena, se aprendió a tomar decisiones más rápidamente. Con respecto a las expectativas futuras, se espera que los directivos muestren más empatía hacia las necesidades ajenas y que prevalezca la funcionalidad de ellos en el desempeño de las tareas administrativas.Alternate abstract:COVID-19 caused a worldwide paralysis. An asynchronous study among executive officers was developed, using the qualitative Delphi method, during the confinement stage, by a couple of companies, one from Colombia, another from Spain. Participants were human resources and marketing managers (some of them working in both areas) of large companies, SMEs, non-profit organizations, and professional unions, located in both countries. A forecast of expected changes in interpersonal relationships was the main objective of the study;however, as participants broadened the debate, topics related to administrative functions emerged. This paper focuses in the latter. Administrative planning was the most affected function by the pandemic. Organizational arranges like telecommuting became more common, their interaction and control difficulties raise concerns among directors. Strengthening trust and communication bonds is important. Decision making process was faster during the quarantine period, it is a lesson learned by the participants. Increased empathy to the personal necessities and functionality prevalence in the performance of administrative tasks are both in the future expected by participants.Alternate abstract:A doença por COVID-19 gerou uma paralisia económica no mundo.

However, this social problem has received little attention in research and policy. This study aimed at exploring the COVID-19-related stigma among survivors in Kampala, Uganda. A cross-sectional exploratory research design was used among COVID-19 survivors in Kampala district. Thirty COVID-19 survivors were examined using in-depth interviews. Data obtained were analyzed using thematic approach. The findings of study indicated that COVID-19-related stigma is prevalent. The common form of stigma was social rejection and labeling. Results showed that the survivors of COVID-19 pandemic faced social rejection and community ostracism. Based on the results, reducing stigmatization of the COVID-19 survivors is vital to control the spread of the pandemic. Thus, an all-inclusive effort is needed to address COVID-19-related stigma and its debilitating consequences by health workers and policymakers.

Among the multiple factors possibly involved, a role for air pollution has also been hypothesized. This nationwide observational study demonstrated the significant positive relationship between COVID-19 incidence rates and PM2.5 and NO2 levels in Italy, both considering the period 2016-2020 and the months of the epidemic, through univariate regression models, after logarithmic transformation of the variables, as the data were not normally distributed. That relationship was confirmed by a multivariate analysis showing the combined effect of the two pollutants, adjusted for the old-age index and population density. An increase in PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations by one unit (1 µg/m3) corresponded to an increase in incidence rates of 1.56 and 1.24 × 104 people, respectively, taking into account the average levels of air pollutants in the period 2016-2020, and 2.79 and 1.24 × 104 people during March-May 2020. Considering the entire epidemic period (March-October 2020), these increases were 1.05 and 1.01 × 104 people, respectively, and could explain 59% of the variance in COVID-19 incidence rates (R2 = 0.59).

361663,361663,361663,IoT Platform for COVID-19 Prevention and Control: A Survey,15.743837,4.2177,2021,"Importance: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major threat to nursing homes. During the COVID-19 pandemic wave that hit France in March and April 2020, staff members of some French nursing homes decided to confine themselves with their residents on a voluntary basis to reduce the risk of entry of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 into the facility. Objective: To investigate COVID-19-related outcomes in French nursing homes that implemented voluntary staff confinement with residents. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in French nursing homes from March 1 to May 11, 2020. Participants included residents and staff members of the nursing homes where staff participated in voluntary self-confinement as well as those of the facilities for elderly people where staff did not practice self-confinement. Rates of COVID-19 cases and mortality in the cohort of nursing homes with self confinement were compared with those derived from a population-based survey of nursing homes conducted by French health authorities. Exposures: Nursing homes with staff who self-confined were identified from the media and included if the confinement period of staff with residents was longer than 7 days. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality related to COVID-19 among residents and COVID-19 cases among residents and staff members. COVID-19 was diagnosed by primary care or hospital physicians on the basis of fever and respiratory signs (eg, cough, dyspnea) or a clinical illness compatible with COVID-19; COVID-19 diagnoses were considered confirmed if real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on nasopharyngeal swab was positive and considered possible if the test had not been performed or results were negative. Cases of COVID-19 were recorded by a telephone interview with the directors of nursing homes with staff who self-confined and by a nationwide declaration survey to health authorities for all facilities. Results: This study included 17 nursing homes in which 794 staff members confined themselves to the facility with their 1250 residents. The national survey included 9513 facilities with 385â¯290 staff members and 695â¯060 residents. Only 1 nursing home with staff who self-confined (5.8%) had cases of COVID-19 among residents, compared with 4599 facilities in the national survey (48.3%) (P < .001). Five residents (0.4%) in the nursing homes with staff who self-confined had confirmed COVID-19, compared with 30â¯569 residents (4.4%) with confirmed COVID-19 in the national survey (P < .001); no residents of facilities with self-confinement had possible COVID-19, compared with 31â¯799 residents (4.6%) with possible COVID-19 in the national survey (P < .001). Five residents (0.4%) in the nursing homes with staff who self-confined died of COVID-19, compared with 12â¯516 (1.8%) in the national survey (odds ratio, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.09-0.53; P < .001). Twelve staff members (1.6%) from the facilties with self-confinement had confirmed or possible COVID-19, compared with 29â¯463 staff members (7.6%) in the national survey (P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of French nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, mortality rates related to COVID-19 were lower among nursing homes that implemented staff confinement with residents compared with those in a national survey. These findings suggest that self-confinement of staff members with residents may help protect nursing home residents from mortality related to COVID-19 and residents and staff from COVID-19 infection.","Belmin, Joël; Um-Din, Nathavy; Donadio, Cristiano; Magri, Maurizio; Nghiem, Quoc Duy; Oquendo, Bruno; Pariel, Sylvie; Lafuente-Lafuente, Carmelo",JAMA Netw Open,407,24

A new betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been recognized as the responsible pathogen in this infection. Although coronavirus disease is principally expressed as a pulmonary infection, critical SARS-CoV-2 infection is frequently complicated with coagulopathy, and thromboembolic events are recognizable in several patients. Dehydration, acute inflammatory condition, protracted immobilization during disease, existence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, obesity or hypertension, previous coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, peripheral artery disease are frequent comorbidities in SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized subjects, which possibly augment thrombo-embolic risk. However, other causal factors can still be identified such as unrestricted angiotensin II action, the use of immunoglobulins, an increased production of adhesion molecules able to induce vascular inflammation and endothelial activation, complement stimulation, excessive production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and increased platelet count. Low-molecular-weight heparin should be chosen as early treatment because of its anti-inflammatory action and its ability to antagonize histones and so defend the endothelium. However, several therapeutic possibilities have also been proposed such as fibrinolytic treatment, drugs that target NETs, and complement inhibition. Nevertheless, although the violence of the pandemic may suggest the use of heroic treatments to reduce the frightening mortality that accompanies SARS-CoV-2 infection, we believe that experimental treatments should only be used within approved and controlled protocols, the only ones that can provide useful and specify information on the validity of the treatments.","Allegra, Alessandro; Innao, Vanessa; Allegra, Andrea Gaetano; Musolino, Caterina",Ann Hematol,407,29

Concerns regarding COVID-19-related risks to patients and healthcare workers with the re-introduction of major complex minimally invasive and open surgery have been raised. This study examines the COVID-19 related risks to patients and healthcare workers following the re-introduction of major oesophago-gastric (EG) surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was an international, multi-centre, observational study of consecutive patients treated by open and minimally invasive oesophagectomy and gastrectomy for malignant or benign disease. Patients were recruited from nine European centres serving regions with a high population incidence of COVID-19 between 1 May and 1 July 2020. The primary endpoint was 30-day COVID-19-related mortality. All staff involved in the operative care of patients were invited to complete a health-related survey to assess the incidence of COVID-19 in this group. RESULTS: In total, 158 patients were included in the study (71 oesophagectomy, 82 gastrectomy). Overall, 87 patients (57%) underwent MIS (59 oesophagectomy, 28 gastrectomy). A total of 403 staff were eligible for inclusion, of whom 313 (78%) completed the health survey. Approaches to mitigate against the risks of COVID-19 for patients and staff varied amongst centres. No patients developed COVID-19 in the post-operative period. Two healthcare workers developed self-limiting COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Precautions to minimise the risk of COVID-19 infection have enabled the safe re-introduction of minimally invasive and open EG surgery for both patients and staff. Further studies are necessary to determine the minimum requirements for mitigations against COVID-19.","Alasmar, Mohamed; Kausar, Afsana; Borgstein, Alexander Berend-Jan; Moons, Johnny; Doran, Sophie; de Pascale, Stefano; Restrepo, Rafael; Verrengia, Apollonia; Alloggio, Mariella; Delgado, Ana Moro; Kumar, Sacheen; Del Val, Ismael Díez; Giocapuzzi, Simone; Baiocchi, Gian Luca; de Vega Irañeta, Marta; Salcedo, Gabriel; Vorwald, Peter; Fumagalli Romario, Uberto; Nafteux, Philippe; Gisbertz, Suzanne; Chaudry, Mohammed Asif; Alkhaffaf, Bilal",Ann. surg. oncol,407,10

As health care professionals dedicated to understanding and alleviating disease, many radiation oncologists have failed to acknowledge how structural racism affects the health and well-being of the patients we aim to serve. The literature is full of descriptive statistics showing the higher incidence and mortality experienced by the Black population for health conditions ranging from infant mortality to infectious disease, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Acknowledgment that the root of health disparities experienced by Black people in this country are based in racism is essential to moving the nation and the field of radiation oncology forward. With this lens, a brief overview of structural and institutional racism shapes a discussion of what radiation oncologists and the organizations that represent them can do to address this scourge. As members of a technological field, we often harness the power of data to advance human health and approach challenging diseases with optimism that multidisciplinary effort can produce cure. A few principles to mitigate the longstanding issues of Black marginalization within the field have been recommended via the ATIP (Acknowledgment, Transparency, Intentionality, and rePresentation) and LEADS (Learn, Engage, Advocate, Defend, Support) approaches. However, additional introspection is encouraged. Just as individuals, practices, and organizations rallied to determine how best to address the issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the same investigational fervor must be applied to the issue of racism to combat this sinister and often deadly disease.","Chapman, Christina Hunter; Gabeau, Darlene; Pinnix, Chelsea C; Deville, Curtiland; Gibbs, Iris C; Winkfield, Karen M",,407,16

The WHO declared this as Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 31th of January 2020, and finally a pandemic on 11th March 2020. As of March 24th, 2020, the virus has caused a casualty of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 cases are serious. Mainly based on Chinese newspapers, social media and other digital platform data, this paper analyzes the timeline of the key actions taken by the government and people over three months in five different phases. It found that although there was an initial delay in responding, a unique combination of strong governance, strict regulation, strong community vigilance and citizen participation, and wise use of big data and digital technologies, were some of the key factors in China's efforts to combat this virus. Being inviable and non-measurable (unlike radioactive exposure), appropriate and timely information is very important to form the basic foundation of mitigation and curative measures.

METHODS: On January 27, 2020 the New Jersey Poison Information and Education System (NJPIES) agreed to operate the New Jersey Coronavirus Hotline. Call patterns, subject matter, and staffing and infrastructure strategies that were implemented to meet the demand are described. In addition, a sample of 1500 individual calls were collected and analyzed in an endeavor to describe call times, call days, area from which the call originated, callers to the hotline, primary language of the caller, and why a call was placed to the hotline. Binomial regression analysis was utilized in an attempt to identify significant patterns. RESULTS: Since the inception of the hotline through October 31, NJPIES responded to 57,579 calls for COVID-19 information. Most calls (68.7%) were regarding testing for COVID-19 and for general questions/symptoms. Call types varied when they were analyzed by time of day with calls for general questions/symptoms and where to get tested for COVID-19 showing a significant association for the early morning hours, how to obtain test results being significantly associated with the afternoon hours, and how to renew or obtain a medical license showing a significant association to the evening hours. We additionally noted that specific call types became significant when analyzed on a week-to-week basis and as specific events, like the enactment of the CARES Act of 2020, occurred. CONCLUSION: Although not the traditional role of a regional Poison Control Center, pandemic response synergizes with the workflow of this hotline because the infrastructure, staffing, and healthcare expertise are already present. Poison centers can rapidly adapt through scaling and process change to meet the needs of the public during times of public health threats.","Meaden, Christopher W; Ramdin, Christine; Ruck, Bruce; Nelson, Lewis S; Soukas, Chloe; Hirsch, Mitchell; Alsharif, Peter; Beckford, David; Calello, Diane P",Clin Toxicol (Phila),407,1

The process must prioritise patient safety while being credible, impartial and fair. During the COVID-19 pandemic, all face-to-face interviews were cancelled. Selection was based on a controversial isolated self-assessment score with no evidence checking taking place. From 2021, selection will take place entirely online. Although this has cost and time advantages, new challenges emerge. METHODS: We review surgical selection as it transitions to an online format and suggest validated methods that could be adapted from High Reliability Organisations (HRO). FINDINGS: Virtual selection methods include video interviewing, online examinations and aptitude testing. These tools have been used in business for many years, but their predictive value in surgery is largely unknown. In healthcare, the established online Multi-Specialty Recruitment Assessment (MSRA) examines generic professional capabilities. Its scope, however, is too limited to be used in isolation. Candidates and interviewers alike may have concerns about the technical aspects of virtual recruitment. The significance of human factors must not be overlooked in the online environment. Surgery can learn from HROs, such as aviation. Pilot and air traffic control selection is integral to ensuring safety. These organisations have already established digital selection methods for psychological aptitude, professional capabilities and manual dexterity. CONCLUSION: National selection for higher surgical training (ST3+) can learn from HROs, using validated methods to prioritise patient safety while being acceptable to candidates, trainers and health service recruiters.","Hardie, J A; Green, G; Bor, R; Brennan, P A",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,407,1

South Africa went into a national lockdown in March 2020 to mitigate the impact of the virus. This included a ban on the sales of tobacco and electronic cigarette products. The ban has been a highly contentious issue in South Africa, discussed worldwide, which has drawn many criticisms. The prevalence rate of smoking in South Africa was around 21.5%, with the Western Cape province having a prevalence rate of 39%. We compared the number of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presentations at a large regional referral hospital in the Western Cape province from January to August 2019 with the same period in 2020. Electronic emergency centre data showed a reduction of 69.28% in COPD presentations. To control for some confounders for the same period, we also reviewed patients presenting with urinary tract infections, which showed only a 30.60% reduction. This notable reduction in COPD presentations reduced service pressure of emergency centre and most likely benefitted patients' health.

Materials and Methods: The samples were cultured and characterized using morphological and diagnostic biochemical tests. The analysis of the frequency of the isolates and their antibiotic resistance were calculated using SPSS (version 22) at a significant level of P-value < 0.05. Results: Bacterial isolates were collected from the 1194 clinical specimens, of which 1394 were isolated from urine, 16 from CSF, and 588 from tracheal aspiration. Also, 654 (54.8%) isolates were obtained from females and 540 (45.2%) from males with the age range 15-73 years (P> 0.05). The results showed that 22.1% were gram-positive and 77.9% were gram-negative. In our study, the frequency of Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria was higher than in some studies, and this indicates the genetic changes and resistance of this bacterium to many antibiotics. Conclusion: To prevent further spread of resistance, increase the effectiveness of antibiotics and prevent multidrug resistance, it is essential to establish a precise schedule for the use of antibiotics and assess the resistance pattern periodically in each region based on the antibiotic resistance pattern.","Nouri, Fatemeh; Karami, Pezhman; Zarei, Omid; Kosari, Faezeh; Alikhani, Mohammad Yousef; Zandkarimi, Eghbal; Rezazadeh Zarandi, Ebrahim; Taheri, Mohammad",Infect Drug Resist,407,16

However, exposure to constant stress stimuli can result in chronically elevated CORT levels, possibly leading to inhibition of reproductive and immune activity. Reproduction and immune responses are energetically expensive, so when an animal is immunologically challenged, a tradeoff might be expressed, with CORT potentially mediating it. Our aim was to test how episodic and chronic CORT treatments, alongside wound healing, would affect reproduction in American bullfrog males (Lithobates catesbeianus). Forty animals were divided in four groups: Episodic CORT (daily transdermic application of CORT), placebo (daily transdermic application of sesame oil), chronic CORT (subcutaneous CORT silastic implants), and sham control (subcutaneous empty silastic implants). One week after treatments began, animals were punctured in the leg with a biopsy needle and the wound was photographed after 45 days to determine wound healing status (WS). Blood samples were collected throughout the experiment to measure CORT and T plasma levels. After animal euthanasia, testes were dissected, fixed, and analyzed histologically to determine spermatogenic activity (germinative cyst [GmC] morphometrics). As expected, the episodic CORT treatment had no effect on T plasma levels or spermatogenic activity. On the other hand, chronic CORT treatment reduced GmC morphometric traits, indicating suppression of reproduction, although T levels were not altered. In addition, animals from sham control and chronic CORT treatments with higher T levels presented higher WS, which indicates an immune-enhancing T effect.","Prado, Débora M A; Gomes, Fernando R; Madelaire, Carla B",,407,10

These proteins bind to and regulate target mRNA localization, stability, and translation. Their structure, expression and functions in bony fish are not well understood. Here, we characterized the zebrafish igf2bp2 gene and investigated its functional role in early development. Zebrafish igf2bp2 gives rise to 4 alternatively spliced transcripts. When expressed in cultured cells, all 4 proteins were detected in the cytoplasm. Igf2bp2-A, the longest isoform, has a domain structure similar to its mammalian counterpart. Igf2bp2-B lacks one of the C-terminal KH domains, while Igf2bp2-C lacks the two N-terminal RRM domains. Igf2bp2-D lacks both regions. In adult fish, these igf2bp2 isoforms were detected exclusively in the oocyte. After fertilization, they disappeared within 6 h post fertilization (hpf). At 20 ~ 24 hpf, igf2bp2-A mRNA, but not other mRNAs, was re-expressed in the embryos including in primordial germ cells. Targeted knockdown of Igf2bp2s reduced the numbers of primordial germ cells but did not affect global patterning or growth. The effect was rescued by overexpression of Igf2bp2-A. Likewise, dominant-negative inhibition of Igf2bp2 resulted in a similar reduction in primordial germ cell number. These results not only provide new information about the structure and expression of zebrafish Igf2bp2, but also reveal a critical role of this conserved RNA binding protein in primordial germ cell development.","Li, Mingyu; Rong, Xiaozhi; Lu, Ling; Li, Yun; Yao, Kai; Ge, Wei; Duan, Cunming",Gen Comp Endocrinol,407,13

SARS-CoV-2 viral main protease (Mpro, also called 3C-like protease, 3CLpro) is a potential target for drug design. Crystal and co-crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro have been solved, enabling the rational design of inhibitory compounds. In this study we analyzed the available SARS-CoV-2 and the highly similar SARS-CoV-1 crystal structures. We identified within the active site of the Mpro, in addition to the inhibitory ligands' interaction with the catalytic C145, two key H-bond interactions with the conserved H163 and E166 residues. Both H-bond interactions are present in almost all co-crystals and are likely to occur also during the viral polypeptide cleavage process as suggested from docking of the Mpro cleavage recognition sequence. We screened in silico a library of 6900 FDA-approved drugs (ChEMBL) and filtered using these key interactions and selected 29 non-covalent compounds predicted to bind to the protease. Additional screen, using DOCKovalent was carried out on DrugBank library (11,414 experimental and approved drugs) and resulted in 6 covalent compounds. The selected compounds from both screens were tested in vitro by a protease activity inhibition assay. Two compounds showed activity at the 50 µM concentration range.

Differences in ALT, AST and ESR were non-significant. The odds of IVIG resistance (44.4% vs. 9.6%; (p<0.001) and the hospital length of stay (10.9±5.8 vs. 5.0±3.0 days; p<0.001) were higher in KDSS as were the odds of coronary artery abnormalities (33.9% vs. 8.6%; p<0.001). CONCLUSION: This first meta-analysis on KDSS versus KD represents a basis for future works on KDSS and opens the opportunity for future multicenter studies in the search of causal relationships between presenting elements and the eventual complications of KDSS. The similarities between SARS-CoV-2 multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and KDSS open new horizons to the understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology related to KDSS.","Lamrani, Loubna; Manlhiot, Cedric; Elias, Matthew D; Choueiter, Nadine F; Dionne, Audrey; Harahsheh, Ashraf S; Portman, Michael A; McCrindle, Brian W; Dahdah, Nagib",Can. j. cardiol,407,16

Understanding how and by whom the virus is transmitted can help implement better disease control strategies. Here we have described the use of a noninvasive mask sampling method to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory particles expelled by COVID-19 patients and discussed its relationship to transmission risk. Respiratory particles of 31 symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and 31 asymptomatic healthy volunteers were captured on N-95 masks layered with a gelatin membrane in a 30-minute process that involved talking/reading, coughing, and tidal breathing. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected and quantified using rRT-PCR in the mask and in concomitantly collected nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples. The data were analyzed with respect to patient demographics and clinical presentation. Thirteen of 31(41.9%) patients showed SARS-COV-2 positivity in both the mask and NPS samples, while 16 patients were mask negative but NPS positive. Two patients were both mask and NPS negative. All healthy volunteers except one were mask and NPS negative. The mask positive patients had significantly lower NPS Ct value (26) compared to mask negative patients (30.5) and were more likely to be rapid antigen test positive. The mask positive patients could be further grouped into low emitters (expelling <100 viral copies) and high emitters (expelling >1000 viral copies). The study presents evidence for variation in emission of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles by COVID-19 patients reflecting differences in infectivity and transmission risk among individuals. The results conform to reported secondary infection rates and transmission and also suggest that mask sampling could be explored as an effective tool to assess individual transmission risks, at different time points and during different activities.","Sriraman, Kalpana; Shaikh, Ambreen; Parikh, Swapneil; Udupa, Shreevatsa; Chatterjee, Nirjhar; Shastri, Jayanthi; Mistry, Nerges",PLoS One,407,27

This study aimed to compare characteristics, management, and outcomes of hospitalized stroke patients with or without a hospital diagnosis of CO-VID-19 at a nationwide scale. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study on all French hospitals covering the entire French population using the French national hospital discharge databases (Programme de Médicalisation des Systèmes d'Information, included in the Système National des Données de Santé). All patients hospitalized for stroke between 1 January and 14 June 2020 in France were selected. A diagnosis of COVID-19 was searched for during the index hospitalization for stroke or in a prior hospitalization that had occurred after 1 January 2020. RESULTS: Among the 56,195 patients hospitalized for stroke, 800 (1.4%) had a concomitant COVID-19 diagnosis. Inhospital case-fatality rates were higher in stroke patients with COVID-19, particularly for patients with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 (33.2%), as compared to patients hospitalized for stroke without CO-VID-19 diagnosis (14.1%). Similar findings were observed for 3-month case-fatality rates adjusted for age and sex that reached 41.7% in patients hospitalized for stroke with a concomitant primary diagnosis of COVID-19 versus 20.0% in strokes without COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Patients hospitalized for stroke with a concomitant COVID-19 diagnosis had a higher inhospital and 3 months case-fatality rates compared to patients hospitalized for stroke without a COVID-19 diagnosis. Further research is needed to better understand the excess of mortality related to these cases.","Gabet, Amélie; Grave, Clémence; Chatignoux, Edouard; Tuppin, Philippe; Béjot, Yannick; Olié, Valérie",Neuroepidemiology,407,30

We find that T cell infiltration and interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³) signaling signatures correspond most highly with clinical response to therapy, with a reciprocal decrease in cell-cycle and WNT signaling pathways in responding biopsies. We model the interaction in 58 human cell lines, where IFN-Î³ in vitro exposure leads to a conserved transcriptome response unless cells have IFN-Î³ receptor alterations. This conserved IFN-Î³ transcriptome response in melanoma cells serves to amplify the antitumor immune response. Therefore, the magnitude of the antitumor T cell response and the corresponding downstream IFN-Î³ signaling are the main drivers of clinical response or resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy.","Grasso, Catherine S; Tsoi, Jennifer; Onyshchenko, Mykola; Abril-Rodriguez, Gabriel; Ross-Macdonald, Petra; Wind-Rotolo, Megan; Champhekar, Ameya; Medina, Egmidio; Torrejon, Davis Y; Shin, Daniel Sanghoon; Tran, Phuong; Kim, Yeon Joo; Puig-Saus, Cristina; Campbell, Katie; Vega-Crespo, Agustin; Quist, Michael; Martignier, Christophe; Luke, Jason J; Wolchok, Jedd D; Johnson, Douglas B; Chmielowski, Bartosz; Hodi, F Stephen; Bhatia, Shailender; Sharfman, William; Urba, Walter J; Slingluff, Craig L; Diab, Adi; Haanen, John B A G; Algarra, Salvador Martin; Pardoll, Drew M; Anagnostou, Valsamo; Topalian, Suzanne L; Velculescu, Victor E; Speiser, Daniel E; Kalbasi, Anusha; Ribas, Antoni",Cancer cell,407,16

Some of the modified operations have included making reservations to use the study spaces, scanning university IDs to gain entrance to the building, and picking up requested books and equipment from the lobby. In addition to these changes, there have been no in-person events held to engage with students to promote our resources and services, and there have not been any physical displays of library materials. Before operating with modified services, Cooper Library had one large display area and one smaller display area, both visible to students as they entered the library. Typical physical displays before the pandemic tended to celebrate national or international awareness months, such as Women’s History Month, Black History Month, Pride, or Latinx Heritage Month.

RESULTS: Antibiotics were prescribed in all the cases (52; 100%). Of the 52 patients, 1) 13 (25%) were given antibiotics before hospitalisation, 2) 49 (94.2%) during treatment in the ward and 3) 52 (100%) during treatment in the ICU. Most often, empirical antibiotics were administered in 32 cases (61.5%) to treat methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, and in 23 patients (44.2%) to treat atypical pathogens. The most prescribed antibiotics were ceftriaxone/cefotaxime plus macrolide in (17 cases; 32.7%), ceftriaxone/cefotaxime in (15 cases; 28.8%), ampicillin/amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid or sulbactam (five cases; 9.6%), and quinolones (five cases; 9.6%). Imipenem was the most frequently used antibiotic in the ICU (30 cases; 57.7%), followed by ceftriaxone (28 cases; 53.8%), and piperacillin/tazobactam and fluoroquinolone (17 cases; 32.7%). In 18 cases (34.6%), three antibiotics were given simultaneously; two antibiotics in 29 cases (55.8%) and in five cases (9.6%) only one antibiotic was given.

School closure brought about important challenges to the students' learning process. This context requires strong self-regulatory competences and agency for autonomous learning. Moreover, online remote learning was the main alternative response to classroom learning, which increased the inequalities between students with and without access to technological resources or for those with low digital literacy. All considered, to level the playing field for students without digital resources, there is an urgent need to promote self-regulatory competences through offline intervention solutions. The current paper describes a project with this purpose, using radio broadcasting and letters to reach elementary students without digital resources. Moreover, potential reach and participants' perspectives of the project implementation are presented and discussed. The project draws on a prior evidence-based story-tool intervention grounded on a self-regulated learning framework. The original intervention was set previous to the COVID-19 pandemic and was implemented in the classroom context (N = 1,103 students). Once the schools had been closed down, the mode of intervention was adapted with the collaboration of the community. Alternative solutions were developed as follows: (i) story chapters were read on the radio and students received to their homes a printed script, prompting reflection, and suggesting related activities;(ii) students were provided with the story-tool to read autonomously and received letters from the main characters of the story which included, for example, suggestions for activities and reflection. These two alternative modes of intervention delivery potentially reached 394 elementary students, including students with digital resources. Interviews conducted with a group of students were provided information about the positive aspects of these two modes of intervention delivery, perceived learning (e.g., planning), constraints, and suggestions to improve the project. The current work is likely to merit attention from researchers and educational practitioners, given the need to use offline alternatives to provide support for students without digital resources to engage in autonomous learning during the pandemic period. This project may also be used as an alternative or a complementary solution to online modality.","Cunha, J.; Silva, C.; Guimaraes, A.; Sousa, P.; Vieira, C.; Lopes, D.; Rosario, P.",Frontiers in Psychology,407,1

Development of effective therapies against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. Here, we evaluated the antiviral activity of a remdesivir parent nucleotide analog, GS441524, which targets the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme, and a feline coronavirus prodrug, GC376, which targets its main protease, using a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 infected mouse model. Our results showed that GS441524 effectively blocked the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in the mouse upper and lower respiratory tracts via combined intranasal (i.n.) and intramuscular (i.m.) treatment. However, the ability of high-dose GC376 (i.m. or i.n. and i.m.) was weaker than GS441524. Notably, low-dose combined application of GS441524 with GC376 could effectively protect mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection via i.n. or i.n. and i.m. treatment. Moreover, we found that the pharmacokinetic properties of GS441524 is better than GC376, and combined application of GC376 and GS441524 had a synergistic effect. Our findings support the further evaluation of the combined application of GC376 and GS441524 in future clinical studies.","Shi, Yuejun; Shuai, Lei; Wen, Zhiyuan; Wang, Chong; Yan, Yuanyuan; Jiao, Zhe; Guo, Fenglin; Fu, Zhen F; Chen, Huanchun; Bu, Zhigao; Peng, Guiqing",Emerg Microbes Infect,407,29

These exposures to environmental pollution from both rural and populated/industrialized sources have adverse effects on human health. Although respiratory diseases (e.g. asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are the most commonly reported following long-term exposure to particulate matter and hazardous chemicals, gastrointestinal complications have also been associated with the increased risk of lung disease from inhalation of polluted air. The interconnectedness of these organ systems has offered valuable insights into the roles of the immune system and the micro/mycobiota as mediators of communication between the lung and the gut during disease states. A topical example of this relationship is provided by reports of multiple gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), while the rapid transmission and increased risk of COVID-19 has been linked to poor air quality and high levels of particulate matter. In this review, we focus on the mechanistic effects of environmental pollution on disease progression with special emphasis on the gut-lung axis.","Crawford, Meli039; Shaunte, sa; Nordgren, Tara M; McCole, Declan F",Am. j. physiol. gasterointest. liver physiol,407,24

METHODS: Quantitative questionnaires were prepared and distributed between May 27 and June 11, 2020. A 29-question survey targeting patients with cancer was distributed electronically via cancer support organizations. Cross-sectional data from a selected weekday at a radiation oncology department were also analyzed. In addition, a 25-question survey was distributed to 168 physicians employed by a comprehensive cancer center. RESULTS: In total, we have analyzed 468 patients' and 101 physicians' responses. Among responding patients, 310 were undergoing active treatment and 158 were in follow-up care. Both patients and physicians reported no experiences with video consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic, but 15% of patients stated that they missed telemedicine services that would include a video call. Overall, 30.6% of patients expressed interest in more frequent usage of telemedicine and 23.3% would start using it. Sixty-seven percent of radiation oncologists expressed interest in more frequent usage of telemedicine, and 14% would use it similarly as in the past. For patients treated with radiation therapy (RT), 59.9% and 63.4% of the responding patients acknowledged that video consultations would be an important addition to medical care during RT course or after the completion of RT, respectively. Comparably, 61.1% and 63.9% of radiation oncologists believed video consultations would be useful or extremely useful for patients undergoing RT or for patients in the follow-up setting, respectively.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused a steep decrease in elective surgery scheduling, to the extent of complete cancellation without future planning of safe development. Purpose: We performed a review of the literature and diagnosis data analysis with the aim to reduce the risk of operating a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 during the incubation period. Methods: We searched for specific words and phrases about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 in the PubMed database (US National Library of Medicine) from December 2019 to April 2020. A detailed analysis of the clinical picture and existing diagnostic tests for COVID-19 was performed to achieve the desired objectives. Results: A total of 1273 out of 5930 articles about COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 did meet the criteria for the searched terms. We reviewed 105 articles, and 60 were selected for analysis. Specific recommendations were described based on our revision. Conclusions: With the combination of immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibody tests + real-time polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 implemented in different time periods by taking into account the natural history of the disease, it is possible to decrease the risk of operating a patient during the incubation period higher than 93%. Adding other security measures can further increase this percentage.

Data on disease progression in immunosuppressed solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are limited. METHODS: We examined the electronic medical records of all SOT recipients with COVID-19 from 12 Massachusetts hospitals between February 1, and May 6, 2020. We analyzed the demographics, clinical parameters, course, and outcomes of illness in these patients. RESULTS: Of 52 COVID-19-positive SOT patients, 77% were hospitalized and 35% required ICU admission. Sixty-nine percent of hospitalized patients had immunosuppression reduced, 6% developed suspected rejection. Co-infections occurred in 45% in ICU vs 5% in non-ICU patients (P = .037). A biphasic pattern of evolution of laboratory tests was observed. In the first 5 days of illness, inflammatory markers were moderately increased. Subsequently, WBC, CRP, ferritin, and D Dimer increased with increasing stay in the ICU, and lymphocyte counts were similar. Five patients (16%) died. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that SOT is associated with high rate of hospitalization, ICU admission, and death from COVID-19 compared to data in the general population of patients with COVID-19. Despite reduction in immunosuppression, suspected rejection was rare. The clinical course and trend of laboratory biomarkers is biphasic with a later, pronounced peak in inflammatory markers seen in those admitted to an ICU.

Continuous transmission of the virus is mostly due to insufficient infection control measures and a lack of vaccines. Therefore, this review aimed to identify and describe possible vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19. Methods: A systematic review of the scientific literature was performed through electronic searches of the main databases to identify published reports or studies on vaccines under development against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Websites from international organizations, institutes of health and research, Google, and references from identified studies were also reviewed. Studies examining the mechanisms of infection, immunopathology, and genomics were excluded. Results: A total of 141 vaccines in development against SARS-CoV-2 were identified. The technologies used include weakened and inactive viruses, viral vectors, nucleic acids, and proteins. So far, 13 vaccines (9.2%) are under clinical evaluation; only the AZD1222 vaccine is under clinical evaluation Phase II-III. Ad5-nCoV and mRNA-1273 vaccines showed to produce neutralizing antibodies and also to be safe. Conclusions: Despite efforts invested in developing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, more research is still required.

The general mortality rate of the COVID-19 was about 3%. However, the mortality risk seems to be a significant increase in elderly and cases with chronic disease, who are more likely to develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There still lacks effective methods for ARDS of COVID-19 patients and the prognosis was poor. Mesenchyma stem cells (MSCs) based treatment has the advantage of targeting numerous pathophysiological components of ARDS by secreting a series of cell factors, exerting anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, immunomodulatory, antiapoptotic, and proangiogenic effects, resulting in significant structural and functional recovery following ARDS in various preclinical models. And recently pilot clinical studies indicated MSCs based therapy was promise in treatment of ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Methods: A total of 104 epilepsy patients admitted to our hospital during October and November of 2019 were evaluated for their QOL using the QOL in Epilepsy-31 questionnaire. These assessments were repeated in July 2020 and August 2020 to evaluate the impact of the epidemic on the QOL of epilepsy patients in the same group. The data of the patients were analyzed in SPSS. Results: During the pandemic period, overall score values decreased significantly compared to the pre-pandemic period (p=0.049). Although most of the subscores worsened with the pandemic, the most significant deterioration was observed in emotional well-being (p=0.021). There were six patients (5.8%) whose seizure frequency increased during the pandemic period. In the multivariate analysis, the only parameter that predicted an increase in seizure frequency during COVID-19 was the overall score. Overall score had a positive correlation with educational level. Disease duration, age, marital status, and number of drugs used were found to be negatively correlated with the overall score of the patients. Conclusion: The COVID-19 epidemic causes a significant deterioration in QOL in patients with epilepsy. During epidemics such as COVID-19, clinicians should consider psychosocial factors.

The fact that, soon afterward, the two million people Slovenia was the first European country proclaiming the end of COVID-19 epidemic within national borders may be relevant from this perspective. Motivated by this evolution, in this paper the time dynamics of coronavirus cases in Slovenia is investigated with emphasis on how efficient various containment measures act to diminish the number of COVID-19 infections. Noteworthily, the present analysis does not rely on any speculative theoretical assumption; it is solely based on raw epidemiological data. Out of the results presented here, the most important one is perhaps the finding that, while imposing drastic curfews and travel restrictions reduce the infection rate &#954; by a factor of four with respect to the unrestricted state, they only improve the &#954;-value by &#8776;15% as compared to the much bearable state of social and economic life wherein wearing face masks and social distancing rules are enforced/followed.

These limitations have proven effective in slowing down the spread of the infection. However, the benefits obtained in public health have come with huge costs in terms of social, economic, and psychological well-being. In the current study, we aimed to investigate how the period of home confinement affected self-reported sleep characteristics in Italians and Belgians, with special regard to sleep timing and subjective quality. Using an online survey we collected data from 2272 participants, 1622 Italians (Mage = 34.1 ± 13.6 years, 1171 F), and 650 Belgian (Mage = 43.0 ± 16.8 years, 509 F). Participants reported their sleep pattern (eg, bedtime, risetime) and perceived sleep quality during and, retrospectively, before the lockdown. During the lockdown, sleep timing was significantly delayed, time spent in bed increased, and sleep quality was markedly impaired in both Italians and Belgians. The most vulnerable individuals appeared to be women, subjects experiencing a more negative mood, and those perceiving the pandemic situation as highly stressful. However, the two samples differed in the subgroups most affected by the changes, possibly because of the different welfare systems of the two countries. In fact, in the Italian sample sleep quality and timing underwent significant modifications especially in unemployed participants, whereas in the Belgian sample this category was the one who suffered less from the restrictions. Considering that the novel coronavirus has spread across the whole globe, involving countries with different types of health and welfare systems, understanding which policy measures have the most effective protective role on physical and mental health is of primary importance.","Cellini, Nicola; Conte, Francesca; De Rosa, Oreste; Giganti, Fiorenza; Malloggi, Serena; Reyt, Mathilde; Guillemin, Camille; Schmidt, Christina; Muto, Vincenzo; Ficca, Gianluca",Sleep Med,407,16

This problem is relevant in areas such as medical testing, DNA sequencing, communication protocols, and many more. In this paper, we study (i) a sparsity-constrained version of the problem, in which the testing procedure is subjected to one of the following two constraints: items are finitely divisible and thus may participate in at most $\gamma$ tests; or tests are size-constrained to pool no more than $\rho$ items per test; and (ii) a noisy version of the problem, where each test outcome is independently flipped with some constant probability. Under each of these settings, considering the for-each recovery guarantee with asymptotically vanishing error probability, we introduce a fast splitting algorithm and establish its near-optimality not only in terms of the number of tests, but also in terms of the decoding time. While the most basic formulations of our algorithms require $\Omega(n)$ storage for each algorithm, we also provide low-storage variants based on hashing, with similar recovery guarantees.","Price, Eric; Scarlett, Jonathan; Tan, Nelvin",,407,24

Infection with these viruses can cause respiratory symptoms. The patients with lung cancer are more susceptible to viral infection and have a worse prognosis due to the advanced age and the systemic immunosuppressive state caused by malignancy itself and the anticancer treatments. In addition, without sufficient clinical awareness, a missed diagnosis of viral pneumonia may occur due to the fever and respiratory symptoms caused by lung cancer and its secondary diseases. Furthermore, control measures against viral outbreaks may interfere with routine diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer patients. Therefore, scientific protection and individualized management of lung cancer patients are particularly important during virus epidemic prevention and control. Here, we systematically reviewed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of viral pneumonia, its impact on patients with lung cancer and the differential diagnosis of lung cancer-related respiratory manifestations, aiming to provide guidance for the individual management of lung cancer patients during the prevention and control of viral pneumonia epidemic.","Yao, Yanhong; Lu, Ming; Liu, Yan039; Cao, Baoshan",Zhongguo Fei Ai Za Zhi,407,14

This cohort reports the first 1,255 adult cases who received anti-COVID-19 treatment at a Spanish hospital from March 1 to 24, 2020. The cost of treatment was calculated. Logistic regression model was used to explore the risk factors present on admission associated with ARDS. Bivariate Cox proportional hazard ratio model was employed to determine the hazard ratio (HR) between individual factors and death. We included 1,255 patients (median age 65 years; 57.8% male), of which 92.3% required hospitalization. Prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus was 45.1%, 31.4%, and 19.9%, respectively. Lymphocytopenia (54.8%), elevated alanine aminotransferase (33.0%) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (58.5%) were frequent. Overall, 36.7% of patients developed ARDS, 10.0% were admitted to an intensive care unit and 21.3% died. Most frequent antiviral combinations used were lopinavir/ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine (44.2%), followed by triple therapy with ß-interferon 1b (32.5%).

However, specific data about COVID-19 patients under 65 years old who are admitted to the hospital are scarce. METHODS: The COVID-19 patients under 65 years old who were admitted to the hospital in Sichuan Province, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, and Wuhan Red Cross Hospital were included in this study. Demographic information, laboratory data and clinical treatment courses were extracted from electronic medical records. Risk factors associated with oxygen therapy were explored. RESULTS: Eight hundred thirty-three COVID-19 patients under 65 years old were included. Of the included patients, 29.4% had one or more comorbidities. Oxygen therapy was required in 63.1% of these patients, and the mortality was 2.9% among the oxygen therapy patients. Fever (odds ratio [OR] 2.072, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.312-3.271, p = 0.002), dyspnea (OR 2.522, 95% CI 1.213-5.243, p = 0.013), chest distress (OR 2.278, 95% CI 1.160-4.473, p = 0.017), elevated respiratory rate (OR 1.114, 95% CI 1.010-1.228, p = 0.031), and decreased albumin (OR 0.932, 95% CI 0.880-0.987, p = 0.016) and globulin levels (OR 0.929, 95% 0.881-0.980, p = 0.007) were independent factors related to oxygen therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Oxygen therapy is highly required in COVID-19 patients under 65 years old who are admitted to the hospital, but the success rate is high. Respiratory failure-related symptoms, elevated respiratory rate, low albumin and globulin levels, and fever at admission are independent risk factors related to the requirement of oxygen.","Ni, Yue-Nan; Wang, Ting; Liang, Bin-Miao; Liang, Zong-An",PLoS One,407,1

Ethiopia reported its first case on 13 March 2020 but has an accelerated case load and geographical distribution recently. In this article, we described the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Oromia Region, the largest and most populous region in Ethiopia, during the early months of the outbreak. METHODS: We analysed data from the COVID-19 surveillance database of the Oromia Regional Health Bureau. We included all reverse transcription-PCR-confirmed cases reported from the region between 13 March and 13 September 2020. RESULTS: COVID-19 was confirmed in 8955 (5.5%) of 164 206 tested individuals. The test positivity rate increased from an average of 1.0% in the first 3 months to 6.3% in August and September. About 70% (6230) of the cases were men; the mean age was 30.0 years (SD=13.3), and 90.5% were <50 years of age. Only 64 (0.7%) of the cases had symptoms at diagnosis. Cough was the most common among symptomatic cases reported in 48 (75.0%), while fever was the least. Overall, 4346 (48.5%) have recovered from the virus; and a total of 52 deaths were reported with a case fatality rate of 1.2%. However, we should interpret the reported case fatality rate cautiously since in 44 (84.6%) of those reported as COVID-19 death, the virus was detected from dead bodies. CONCLUSION: Despite the steady increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases, Ethiopia has so far avoided the feared catastrophe from the pandemic due to the milder and asymptomatic nature of the disease. However, with the current pattern of widespread community transmission, the danger posed by the pandemic remains real. Thus, the country should focus on averting COVID-19-related humanitarian crisis through strengthening COVID-19 surveillance and targeted testing for the most vulnerable groups.","Gudina, Esayas Kebede; Gobena, Dabesa; Debela, Tessema; Yilma, Daniel; Girma, Tsinuel; Mekonnen, Zeleke; Woldie, Mirkuzie; Abdena, Dereje; Shume, Gemechu; Kenate, Birhanu; Lemi, Meles; Diriba, Dereje; Degfie, Tizta Tilahun",BMJ Open,407,14

METHODS: Data collected routinely from people referred for cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) following hospitalization for Covid-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Persistent dyspnea was assessed using the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea (mMRC) scale. RESULTS: Twenty-three people with persistent symptoms were referred for CPET. Mean mMRC dyspnea score was 1 (SD = 1) and was significantly associated with VO2peak (%) (rho = -0.49). At 6 months, those hospitalized in the general ward had a slightly reduced VO2peak (87% [SD = 20]), whereas those who had been in the intensive care unit (ICU) had a moderately reduced VO2peak (77% [SD = 15]). Of note, the results of the CPET revealed that, in all patients, respiratory equivalents were high, power-to-weight ratios were low, and those who had been in the ICU had a relatively low ventilatory efficiency (mean VE/VCO2 slope = 34 [SD = 5]). Analysis of each individual showed that none had a breathing reserve <15% or 11 L/min, all had a normal exercise electrocardiogram, and 4 had a heart rate above 90%. CONCLUSION: At 6 months, persistent dyspnea was associated with reduced physical fitness. This study offers initial insights into the mid-term physical fitness of people who required hospitalization for Covid-19. It also provides novel pathophysiological clues about the underlaying mechanism of the physical limitations associated with persistent dyspnea. Those with persistent dyspnea should be offered a tailored rehabilitation intervention, which should probably include muscle reconditioning, breathing retraining, and perhaps respiratory muscle training. IMPACT: This study is the first to show that a persistent breathing disorder (in addition to muscle deconditioning) can explain persistent symptoms 6 months after hospitalization for Covid-19 infection and suggests that a specific rehabilitation intervention is warranted.","Debeaumont, David; Boujibar, Fairuz; Ferrand-Devouge, Eglantine; Artaud-Macari, Elise; Tamion, Fabienne; Gravier, Francis-Edouard; Smondack, Antoine; Cuvelier, Antoine; Muir, Jean-François; Alexandre, Kevin; Bonnevie, Tristan",Phys. ther,407,1

RESEARCH QUESTION: Is portable CXR an effective exclusionary test for future adverse clinical outcomes in patients suspected of having COVID-19? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Charts of consecutive patients suspected of having COVID-19 at five EDs in New York City between March 19, 2020, and April 23, 2020, were reviewed. Patients were categorized based on absence of findings on initial CXR. The primary outcomes were hospital admission, mechanical ventilation, ARDS, and mortality. RESULTS: Three thousand two hundred forty-five adult patients, 474 (14.6%) with negative initial CXR results, were reviewed. Among all patients, negative initial CXR results were associated with a low probability of future adverse clinical outcomes, with negative likelihood ratios of 0.27 (95% CI, 0.23-0.31) for hospital admission, 0.24 (95% CI, 0.16-0.37) for mechanical ventilation, 0.19 (95% CI, 0.09-0.40) for ARDS, and 0.38 (95% CI, 0.29-0.51) for mortality. Among the subset of 955 patients younger than 65 years and with a duration of symptoms of at least 5 days, no patients with negative CXR results died, and the negative likelihood ratios were 0.17 (95% CI, 0.12-0.25) for hospital admission, 0.09 (95% CI, 0.02-0.36) for mechanical ventilation, and 0.09 (95% CI, 0.01-0.64) for ARDS. INTERPRETATION: Initial CXR in adult patients suspected of having COVID-19 is a strong exclusionary test for hospital admission, mechanical ventilation, ARDS, and mortality.

The purpose of this work was to identify risk factors associated with need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), to analyse viral kinetics in patients with and without IMV and to provide a comprehensive description of clinical course. METHODS: A cohort of 168 hospitalised adult COVID-19 patients enrolled in a prospective observational study at a large European tertiary care centre was analysed. RESULTS: Forty-four per cent (71/161) of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Shorter duration of symptoms before admission (aOR 1.22 per day less, 95% CI 1.10-1.37, p < 0.01) and history of hypertension (aOR 5.55, 95% CI 2.00-16.82, p < 0.01) were associated with need for IMV. Patients on IMV had higher maximal concentrations, slower decline rates, and longer shedding of SARS-CoV-2 than non-IMV patients (33 days, IQR 26-46.75, vs 18 days, IQR 16-46.75, respectively, p < 0.01). Median duration of hospitalisation was 9 days (IQR 6-15.5) for non-IMV and 49.5 days (IQR 36.8-82.5) for IMV patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a short duration of symptoms before admission as a risk factor for severe disease that merits further investigation and different viral load kinetics in severely affected patients. Median duration of hospitalisation of IMV patients was longer than described for acute respiratory distress syndrome unrelated to COVID-19.","Thibeault, Charlotte; Mühlemann, Barbara; Helbig, Elisa T; Mittermaier, Mirja; Lingscheid, Tilman; Tober-Lau, Pinkus; Meyer-Arndt, Lil A; Meiners, Leonie; Stubbemann, Paula; Haenel, Sascha S; Bosquillon de Jarcy, Laure; Lippert, Lena; Pfeiffer, Moritz; Stegemann, Miriam S; Roehle, Robert; Wiebach, Janine; Hippenstiel, Stefan; Zoller, Thomas; Müller-Redetzky, Holger; Uhrig, Alexander; Balzer, Felix; von Kalle, Christof; Suttorp, Norbert; Jones, Terry C; Drosten, Christian; Witzenrath, Martin; Sander, Leif E; Corman, Victor M; Kurth, Florian",Infection,407,3

PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in Istanbul, Turkey, between March and June 2020, where a total of 4,700 persons were approached and 3,672 (78%) of participants (64.4% males and 35.6% females) completed the Knowledge Attitude Practices (KAP) and Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) questionnaires. RESULTS: In this study, 64.1% of participants were categorized as psychologically fatigued and 35.9% as normal. There was a significant difference between fatigued and normal participants with respect to age, educational level, occupational status, place of residence and number of family members (p < .001). Other differences related to knowledge of COVID-19 were symptoms, treatment, ways of spreading (p < .001), prevention by avoiding crowded places (p = .008) and isolation (p = .002). For attitudinal items, normal participants generally showed more positive attitudes than the fatigued in believing that COVID-19 will finally be controlled, satisfaction with preventive measures taken by the authorities, reporting suspected cases with symptoms and trusting that Turkey can overcome the COVID-19 pandemic (p < .001). Multivariate stepwise regression analysis indicated that level of education, avoiding going to crowded places, eye, nose and mouth organs are sensitive organs to the virus, keeping physical distance due to epidemic affect by COVID-19 virus, isolation and treatment of people reduce the spread of COVID-19 virus and 14-days period of time, COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with the respiratory droplets of an infected person, occupational status, health education programme needed and antibody treatment variables were significantly associated with fatigue after adjusting for age, gender and income variables. CONCLUSION: The current study provides valuable information for policymakers and mental health professionals worldwide regarding associations between the mental health of individuals and the ongoing outbreak, COVID-19.","Morgul, Ebru; Bener, Abdulbari; Atak, Muhammed; Akyel, Salih; Aktas, Selman; Bhugra, Dinesh; Ventriglio, Antonio; Jordan, Timothy R",Int J Soc Psychiatry,407,1

This study examined how educational disparities in mask-wearing, handwashing, and limiting public outings might be contingent upon three factors: contextual cue of danger, perceived risk of local outbreak, and interventional context with different levels of intensity (i.e, Wuhan vs. other areas). Data were obtained from a telephone survey of 3327 adults, who were recruited through a random-digit-dial method to be representative of all cell phone users in China. Interviews were conducted from 28 April to 26 May 2020. Stratified multiple regression models showed that educational disparities in all three behaviors were only consistently observed among people exposed to context cues of danger, with an enhanced sense of risk of a local outbreak, or in areas other than Wuhan. College education seems to make a difference in handwashing regardless of contextual cues of danger or perception of risk. The findings suggested that, in the process of an epidemic, emerging threats in one's immediate environment or raised awareness of risks are important conditions triggering educational disparities in prevention. However, effective public health interventions could potentially reduce such disparities.","Li, Miao; Wang, Weidong",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),407,11

METHODS: Twitter data (N=82,893) related to both older adults and COVID-19 and dated from January 23 to May 20, 2020, were analyzed. We used a combination of data science methods (including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, supervised machine learning, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis), qualitative thematic analysis, and conventional statistics. RESULTS: The most common category in the coded tweets was ""personal opinions"" (66.2%), followed by ""informative"" (24.7%), ""jokes/ridicule"" (4.8%), and ""personal experiences"" (4.3%). The daily average of ageist content was 18%, with the highest of 52.8% on March 11, 2020. Specifically, more than one in ten (11.5%) tweets implied that the life of older adults is less valuable or downplayed the pandemic because it mostly harms older adults. A small proportion (4.6%) explicitly supported the idea of just isolating older adults. Almost three-quarters (72.9%) within ""jokes/ridicule"" targeted older adults, half of which were ""death jokes."" Also, 14 themes were extracted, such as perceptions of lockdown and risk. A bivariate Granger causality test suggested that informative tweets regarding at-risk populations increased the prevalence of tweets that downplayed the pandemic. DISCUSSION: Ageist content in the context of COVID-19 was prevalent on Twitter. Information about COVID-19 on Twitter influenced public perceptions of risk and acceptable ways of controlling the pandemic. Public education on the risk of severe illness is needed to correct misperceptions.","Xiang, Xiaoling; Lu, Xuan; Halavanau, Alex; Xue, Jia; Sun, Yihang; Lai, Patrick Ho Lam; Wu, Zhenke",,407,1

These restrictive policies had adverse economic and social consequences that triggered a follow-up wave of expansionist public interventions intended to mitigate these effects. ‘Shock-responsive’ social protection measures included increased benefits to existing beneficiaries (vertical expansion) and registration of new beneficiaries on existing programmes (horizontal expansion). These approaches had the advantages of being quick and administratively simple, but the disadvantage of bypassing people who were made most vulnerable by COVID-19, notably retrenched and informal workers with no access to social insurance. On the other hand, setting up new humanitarian relief or temporary social assistance programmes was slow and susceptible to targeting errors and corruption. COVID-19 also prompted a reassessment of the social contract regarding social protection, with some governments recognising that they need to become better coordinated, more inclusive and rights-based.

Patients are usually unaware of the development of oral disease as it is not visible to them and largely asymptomatic, especially in its early stages. The natural progression of conditions such as caries and periodontitis is inevitable without diagnosis and management. The full extent of patient harm because of the suspension of routine dental care can only be estimated when routine oral examinations are fully re-established, and even then, we will probably never know the number of individuals impacted or the extent of disease progression and harm.In first-world countries, there has always been a back-up emergency treatment system for dental problems. For example, in the UK, the safety net for life-threatening swellings and for acute pain relief is the accident and emergency services. This system remained in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Courts could be expected to understand the coronavirus context and would take this into account should there be a complaint against the clinician about access to care.The suspension of routine dental care to save lives will lead to the closure of many dental practices due to substantial financial impact. The return to routine care will be slow, with prioritisation of non-aerosol generating procedures while we look to further understand methods to mitigate transmission risk via infected aerosol and spatter. Inevitably, the cost of personal protective equipment and the lower volume of patients pose a continued threat to businesses.","Coulthard, Paul; Thomson, Peter; Dave, Manas; Coulthard, Francesca P; Seoudi, Noha; Hill, Mike",Br Dent J,407,16

Traditional single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques use molecules of variable sizes (as determined by its localization precision (LP)) to reconstruct a super-resolution map. This results in an image with overlapping and superimposing PSFs (due to a wide size-spectrum of single-molecules) that undermine image resolution. Ideally, it should be possible to identify the brightest molecules (also termed as the fortunate molecules) to reconstruct ultra-superresolution map, provided sufficient statistics is available from the recorded data. Probabilistic Optically-Selective Single-molecule Imaging Based Localization Encoded (POSSIBLE) microscopy explores this possibility by introducing a narrow probability size-distribution of single-molecules (narrow size-spectrum about a predefined mean-size). The reconstruction begins by presetting the mean and variance of the narrow distribution function (Gaussian function). Subsequently, the dataset is processed and single-molecules are filtered by the Gaussian function to remove unfortunate molecules. The fortunate molecules thus retained are then mapped to reconstruct an ultra-superresolution map. In-principle, the POSSIBLE microscopy technique is capable of infinite resolution (resolution of the order of actual single-molecule size) provided enough fortunate molecules are experimentally detected. In short, bright molecules (with large emissivity) holds the key. Here, we demonstrate the POSSIBLE microscopy technique and reconstruct single-molecule images with an average PSF sizes of &#963; ± &#916;&#963; = 15 ± 10 nm, 30 ± 2 nm & 50 ± 2 nm. Results show better-resolved Dendra2-HA clusters with large cluster-density in transfected NIH3T3 fibroblast cells as compared to the traditional SMLM techniques. Cluster analysis indicates densely-packed HA molecules, HA-HA interaction, and a surge in the number of HA molecules per cluster post 24 Hrs of transfection. The study using POSSIBLE microscopy introduces new insights in influenza biology. We anticipate exciting applications in the multidisciplinary field of disease biology, oncology, and biomedical imaging.","Pratim Mondal, Partha",PLoS One,407,13

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 from 19 designated hospitals between January 1 to February 29, 2020 were included, and the main exposure of interest was administration of thymosin &#945;1. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to account for baseline confounders, cluster analysis and Cox proportional hazard model was used to account for subgroup analysis. RESULTS: A total of 771 patients were included, and 327/771 (42.4%) patients received thymosin &#945;1 therapy. The 28-day mortality in thymosin group was significantly lower than that in control group (41.3% vs. 60.6%, p < 0.001). After PSM 522 patients were included in analysis and the 28-day mortality in thymosin &#945;1 group and control group were 51.0% and 52.9% respectively, with no significant difference. In subgroup analyses, the association between thymosin &#945;1 therapy and 28-day mortality appeared to be stronger among male patients (HR 0.673, 95% CI 0.454-0.998; p = 0.049). There were no benefits of thymosin &#945;1 in 28-day mortality in other subgroups. There were two phenotypes after cluster analysis, but no benefits of thymosin &#945;1 were shown in phenotype 1 (HR 0.823 95% CI 0.581-1.166; p = 0.273) and phenotype 2 (HR 1.148 95% CI 0.710-1.895; p = 0.442).

An intervention that has proved beneficial is the use of prone positioning (PP) for mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS. In one institution, PP was practiced in the medical ICU for this population. However, with the dramatically increasing patient load, staff anticipated that greater capacity to provide this treatment to all qualifying patients would be required. METHODS: A group of physical therapists and occupational therapists (PT/OTs) with ICU experience was redeployed from their regular roles to receive training in PP from an experienced medical ICU (MICU) RN. After intensive training, the team was ready to provide PP to patients. As the workload increased, additional PT/OTs were recruited to the team. A coordinating structure comprising attending pulmonologists screened and advised on appropriate patients. A communication and feedback structure was also implemented. RESULTS: Over a period of seven weeks, the team provided PP to more than 100 patients, with 577 individual interventions in a total of 14 ICUs and one emergency department. There were no major airway or central venous access complications, and only one anterior pressure injury was recorded. CONCLUSION: The rapid implementation of an interdisciplinary PP team in a crisis situation is feasible. It can provide a safe and efficient alternative to adding to the workload of an overloaded nursing staff.","Chiu, Maggie; Goldberg, Adam; Moses, Shirah; Scala, Peter; Fine, Cynthia; Ryan, Patrick",Jt.

The main aim of this study is to examine the level of psychological distress during COVID-19 in Bangladesh and explore factors associated with higher psychological distress. Methods: An internet-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted from March to April 2020 in Bangladesh among adults 18 years old and above using structured online questionnaires distributed through emails and other social media throughout Bangladesh with an overall response rate of 34%. Modified version of the Covid19 peritraumatic distress index (CPDI) was used to measure distress. Univariate and Bivariate analysis was used to estimate prevalence of CPDI symptoms and test for the associations between CPDI and the exposure variables. Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the odds ratios of our outcome variable by exposure variables. Results: Overall, 44.3% of respondents were suffering from mild to moderate distress and 9.5% were suffering from severe distress. Female respondents were 2.435 times more likely to suffer from CPDI mild to severe distress than males. As compared to Dhaka and Mymensing region of Bangladesh, odds of distress was 1.945 times more in Chittagong/Sylhet region (p-valueâ¯=â¯0.035). Conclusion: Large proportion of adult population in Bangladesh are experiencing psychological distress, with level of distress varies by different symptoms and predictors.

Expert judgements, whether human or artificial, can help in taking correct decisions, especially when exploration of alternative solutions is costly. As expert opinions might deviate, the problem of finding the right alternative can be approached as a collective decision making problem (CDM). Current state-of-the-art approaches to solve CDM are limited by the quality of the best expert in the group, and perform poorly if experts are not qualified or if they are overly biased, thus potentially derailing the decision-making process. In this paper, we propose a new algorithmic approach based on contextual multi-armed bandit problems (CMAB) to identify and counteract such biased expertises. We explore homogeneous, heterogeneous and polarised expert groups and show that this approach is able to effectively exploit the collective expertise, irrespective of whether the provided advice is directly conducive to good performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, especially when the quality of the provided expertise degrades. Our novel CMAB-inspired approach achieves a higher final performance and does so while converging more rapidly than previous adaptive algorithms, especially when heterogeneous expertise is readily available.","Abels, Axel; Lenaerts, Tom; Trianni, Vito; Now'e, Ann",,407,15

Given the paradigmatic selectivity of the DNA hybridization, this approach allows pathogen detection in the presence of other pathogens, demonstrated by the detection of Listeria monocytogenes in presence of Escherichia coli. We note that this design is in principle amenable to any pathogen for which the DNA has been sequenced, including other viruses and bacteria.

However, its environmental consequences are poorly understood. Thus, to assess whether COVID-19 therapy based on the use of azithromycin (AZT) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) during the pandemic affects wild aquatic life, we exposed (for 72 h) neotropical tadpoles of the species Physalaemus cuvieri to the water containing these drugs to 12.5 µg/L. We observed that the increase in superoxide dismutase and catalase in tadpoles exposed to AZT (alone or in combination with HCQ) was predominant to keep the production of NO, ROS, TBARS and H2O2 equitable between the experimental groups. In addition, the uptake of AZT and the strong interaction of AZT with acetylcholinesterase (AChE), predicted by the molecular docking analysis, were associated with the anticholinesterase effect observed in the groups exposed to the antibiotic. However, the unexpected increase in butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in these same groups suggests its constitutive role in maintaining cholinergic homeostasis. Therefore, taken together, our data provide a pioneering evidence that the exposure of P. cuvieri tadpoles to AZT (alone or in combination with HCQ) in a predictably increased environmental concentration (12.5 µg/L) elicits a compensatory adaptive response that can have, in the short period of exposure, guaranteed the survival of the animals. However, the high energy cost for maintaining physiological homeostasis, can compromise the growth and development of animals and, therefore, in the medium-long term, have a general negative effect on the health of animals. Thus, it is possible that COVID-19 therapy, based on the use of AZT, affects wild aquatic life, which requires greater attention to the impacts that this drug may represent.","da Luz, Thiarlen Marinho; Araújo, Amanda Pereira da Costa; Estrela, Fernanda Neves; Braz, Helyson Lucas Bezerra; Jorge, Roberta Jeane Bezerra; Charlie-Silva, Ives; Malafaia, Guilherme",Sci Total Environ,407,2

How to interpret FVC findings in an individual patient with IPF in the real-world setting amid uncertainty about the measurement accuracy and variability has not been well established. AREAS COVERED: This review highlights the challenges and limitations of using FVC in the clinic to monitor disease progression in patients with IPF. Spirometry is noninvasive, relatively simple, and inexpensive. FVC measurements provide evidence for trends over time in patients with IPF. When using FVC in the clinic, several important challenges and limitations, including visit-to-visit variability, dependence on patient effort, inconsistent quality control, limitations on accuracy, and the influence of comorbidities and pretest factors, must be considered. Recent studies suggest the potential for home spirometry devices to facilitate more frequent collection of data and perhaps demonstrate more accurate trends. EXPERT OPINION: Measuring FVC decline in the clinic has an important role in monitoring disease progression in patients with IPF, but additional measures of disease progression should be considered along with FVC to facilitate decision-making about disease management.","Nathan, Steven D; Wanger, Jack; Zibrak, Joseph D; Wencel, Mark L; Burg, Cindy; Stauffer, John L",Expert Rev Respir Med,407,24

An online survey was distributed through social networks during forced home confinement, collecting data from1298 participants of 19 different Italian regions. Chronotype was evaluated using the reduced version of the Morningness/Eveningness Questionnaire (rMEQ); sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); resilience levels were measured by the 10-item version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC10); post-traumatic stress reactions were assessed by the 6-item version of the Impact of Event Scale (IES6). Resilience and sleep quality were significantly lower in the evening compared to non-evening types, as well as in females as compared to males. Moreover, resilience was negatively correlated with post-traumatic stress reactions and positively correlated with sleep quality. A negative correlation was also reported between sleep quality and post-traumatic stress reactions. Sleep quality was identified as a possible mediator between chronotype and resilience, and between resilience and post-traumatic stress reactions, after controlling for age and sex. These findings provide new insights into the role of chronotype in adapting to continuous stressful situations. Sleep quality seems to mediate the causal path between the antecedents of resilience and the development of trauma. Further research is needed to explore the suitability of primary interventions based on chronobiology and sleep hygiene to mitigate the impact of pandemic-related home confinement measures on mental health among the general population.","Bazzani, A; Bruno, S; Frumento, P; Cruz-Sanabria, F; Turchetti, G; Faraguna, U",Chronobiol Int,407,16

METHODS: We included 76 patients with Coronavirus disease 2019, classified into the high-dose vitamin C group (loading dose of 6g intravenous infusion per 12 hr on the first day, and 6g once for the following 4 days, n=46) and the standard therapy group (standard therapy alone, n=30). RESULTS: The risk of 28-day mortality was reduced for the high-dose vitamin C versus the standard therapy group (HR=0.14, 95% CI, 0.03-0.72). Oxygen support status was improved more with high-dose vitamin C than standard therapy (63.9% vs 36.1%). No safety events were associated with high-dose vitamin C therapy.

While fiction may cultivate our expectations about the probable paths of the pandemic, it also invites us to participate in the creative process of imagining alternative futures. This essay examines how two recent novels, Ling Ma's Severance (2018) and Karen Thomson Walker's The Dreamers (2019), offer feminist refigurations of the genre Priscilla Wald has termed ""the outbreak narrative."" Shifting emphasis from the epidemiological quest plot that has tended to dominate this genre, both novels focus on everyday cultures and ethics of care, illustrating how patriarchal systems produce and perpetuate conditions of vulnerability. In particular, pregnancy plots in both novels work to interrogate cultures of paternalism, raising key ethical questions about limitations and violations of the bodily autonomy. Illuminating, in spectacular and speculative fashion, how conditions of inequality and precarity are radically revealed and intensified by a public health crisis, novels like Severance and The Dreamers are essential tools for teaching about-and living through-the crisis of our pandemic present.","Waples, Emily",Perspect Biol Med,407,1

DESIGN: A seven-week prospective case series was conducted of urgently referred patients from primary care and accident and emergency department. RESULTS: There was a total of 133 referrals. Referral rates fell by 93 per cent over seven weeks, from a mean of 5.4 to 0.4 per day. Reductions were seen in referrals from both primary care (89 per cent) and the accident and emergency department (93 per cent). Presentations of otitis externa and epistaxis fell by 83 per cent, and presentations of glandular fever, tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess fell by 67 per cent. CONCLUSION: Coronavirus disease 2019 has greatly reduced the number of referrals into secondary care ENT. The cause for this reduction is likely to be due to patients' increased perceived risk of the virus presence in a medical setting. The impact of this reduction is yet to be ascertained, but will likely result in a substantial increase in emergency pressures once the lockdown is lifted and the general public's perception of the coronavirus disease 2019 risk reduces.","Osborne, M S; Bentley, E; Farrow, A; Chan, J; Murphy, J",J Laryngol Otol,407,24

Here, we discuss methods for modeling three-dimensional chromatin structures, with focus on a minimalistic polymer model which inverts population Hi-C into single-cell conformations. Utilizing only basic physical properties, this model reveals that a few specific Hi-C interactions can fold chromatin into conformations consistent with single-cell imaging, Dip-C, and FISH measurements. Aggregated single-cell chromatin conformations also reproduce Hi-C frequencies. This approach allows quantification of structural heterogeneity and discovery of many-body interaction units and has revealed additional insights, including (1) topologically associating domains as a byproduct of folding driven by specific interactions, (2) cell subpopulations with different structural scaffolds are developmental stage dependent, and (3) the functional landscape of many-body units within enhancer-rich regions.

METHODS: Thirty-five older adults with hypertension were included in this exploratory study. Accelerometer-based PA and SB measures were assessed before and during a period of social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Housing type, housing surface area and household size were tested as predictors of changes in PA and SB. A generalized linear mixed model was used for the analysis. RESULTS: Housing type was associated with changes in PA and SB. Individuals residing in an apartment showed a greater decrease in light PA on weekdays (ß= -65 min/day, p=0.035) and a trend for an increase in SB (ß= 55 min/day, p=0.056) compared to those residing in a detached house. Individuals residing in a row house showed a greater decrease in moderate-vigorous PA (ß= -10 min/day, p=0.037) and steps/day (ß= -2064, p=0.010) compared to those residing in a detached house. Individuals residing in an apartment showed a greater decrease in light PA on the weekends (ß= -83 min/day, p=0.015) and an increase in SB (ß= 72 min/day, p=0.036) compared to those residing in a detached house. No association was found for housing surface area and household size.

Thus, we examined the actual and perceived overall impact of the COVID-19 crisis on work and private life, and the consequences for mental well-being (MWB), and self-rated health (SRH) in German and Swiss employees. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected via an online questionnaire from 2118 German and Swiss employees recruited through an online panel service (18-65 years, working at least 20 h/week, various occupations). The sample provides a good representation of the working population in both countries. Using logistic regression, we analyzed how sociodemographic factors and self-reported changes in work and private life routines were associated with participants' perceived overall impact of the COVID-19 crisis on work and private life. Moreover, we explored how the perceived impact and self-reported changes were associated with MWB and SRH. RESULTS: About 30% of employees reported that their work and private life had worsened, whereas about 10% reported improvements in work and 13% in private life. Mandatory short-time work was strongly associated with perceived negative impact on work life, while work from home, particularly if experienced for the first time, was strongly associated with a perceived positive impact on work life. Concerning private life, younger age, living alone, reduction in leisure time, and changes in quantity of caring duties were strongly associated with perceived negative impact. In contrast, living with a partner or family, short-time work, and increases in leisure time and caring duties were associated with perceived positive impact on private life. Perceived negative impact of the crisis on work and private life and mandatory short-time work were associated with lower MWB and SRH. Moreover, perceived positive impact on private life and an increase in leisure time were associated with higher MWB. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show the differential impact of the COVID-19 crisis on people's work and private life as well as the consequences for MWB and SRH. This may inform target groups and situation-specific interventions to ameliorate the crisis.","Tusl, Martin; Brauchli, Rebecca; Kerksieck, Philipp; Bauer, Georg Friedrich",BMC Public Health,407,20

OBJECTIVE: This study sought to explore the views and experiences of clinical pharmacists in relation to the provision of clinical pharmacy services during COVID-19. METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with pharmacists working in clinical roles in healthcare settings across Europe. Participants were recruited through professional organisations of clinical and hospitals pharmacists combined with a snowballing technique. The Pharmacy Emergency Preparedness and Response Framework and Disaster Preparedness Framework for pharmacy services were used to generate data which were analysed using the thematic framework method. RESULTS: Twenty-two participants from 16 European countries described a range of measures to protect patients, public and healthcare staff against virus transmission including developing and disseminating educational materials. Most described their involvement in aspects of evidence provision such as facilitating clinical trials, gathering and appraising evidence and disseminating clinical information. Many hospital-based pharmacists were reassigned to new roles such as intensive care. Routine clinical services were extensively interrupted and remote forms of communication were used. Most were motivated by a strong sense of professionalism to continue delivering services. A number of facilitators and barriers to prevention, preparedness and response actions were identified which related to uptake of new roles, recognition of pharmacists roles in the healthcare team, information gathering, communication with patients and healthcare professionals, and provision of routine clinical services. CONCLUSIONS: Participants in this multinational qualitative study described a range of service adaptations and adoption of novel roles to prevent and mitigate the public health impact of the pandemic. The study findings may help to inform governments, public health agencies and healthcare systems in harnessing ongoing service provision and adapt to any future interruptions.","Paudyal, Vibhu; Cadogan, Cathal; Fialová, Daniela; Henman, Martin C; Hazen, Ankie; Okuyan, Betul; Lutters, Monika; Stewart, Derek",Res. soc. adm. pharm,407,14

Herein, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the effect of MoS2 nanotube on the binding of the signal protein YAP65, an important Yes kinase-associated protein domain (WW domain), to the proline rich motif ligand (PRM). We designed four systems based on the different initial binding modes among WW domain, PRM and MoS2 nanotube, and observed two ways to affect the binding of WW domain to PRM. The first pathway, the active site in WW domain was occupied by MoS2 nanotube, which prevents WW domain from binding to PRM. In the second pathway, WW domain was bound to PRM with residues W17 and F29 instead of the two highly conserved residues (Y28 and W39), forming an unstable combination. These two results might cause WW domain to lose its original function or to pass the mistaken signal. However, MoS2 nanotube did not destroy the structure and binding of WW domain and PRM in the composite. These findings shed light on the interaction between MoS2 nanotube and signal protein system, while providing another valuable insight into the potential nanotoxicity of MoS2 nanotube.","Meng, Yajie; Liu, Ruirui; Zhu, Min; Zhai, Honglin; Ren, Cuiling",Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,407,23

The arrival of the Zika and chikungunya viruses to South America increased the complexity of transmission and morbidity caused by these viruses co-circulating in the same vector mosquito species. Here we present an integrated analysis of the reported arbovirus cases between 2007 and 2017 and local climate and socio-economic profiles of three distinct Colombian municipalities (Bello, Cúcuta and Moniquirá). These locations were confirmed as three different ecosystems given their contrasted geographic, climatic and socio-economic profiles. Correlational analyses were conducted with both generalised linear models and generalised additive models for the geographical data. Average temperature, minimum temperature and wind speed were strongly correlated with disease incidence. The transmission of Zika during the 2016 epidemic appeared to decrease circulation of dengue in Cúcuta, an area of sustained high incidence of dengue. Socio-economic factors such as barriers to health and childhood services, inadequate sanitation and poor water supply suggested an unfavourable impact on the transmission of dengue, Zika and chikungunya in all three ecosystems. Socio-demographic influencers were also discussed including the influx of people to Cúcuta, fleeing political and economic instability from neighbouring Venezuela. Aedes aegypti is expanding its range and increasing the global threat of these diseases. It is therefore vital that we learn from the epidemiology of these arboviruses and translate it into an actionable local knowledge base. This is even more acute given the recent historical high of dengue cases in the Americas in 2019, preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, which is itself hampering mosquito control efforts.","Morgan, Jasmine; Strode, Clare; Salcedo-Sora, J Enrique",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,407,24

Ignoring the ethical impacts of information and communication technology health service delivery creates an unintended risk for patients and can lead to reduced effectiveness, noncompliance, and harm, undermining the best intentions of governments and clinicians. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to explore how ethical considerations or impacts may be different, greater, or more variable in information and communication technology methods versus face-to-face health care delivery models, and how they may be applied in practice. METHODS: We undertook a systemic literature review to provide a critical overview of existing research into the incorporation of ethical principles into telehealth practice. Six databases were searched between March 2016 to May 2016 and again in December 2020 to provide the benefit of currency. A combination of broad terms (""ethics,"" ""ethical,"" ""health,"" and ""care"") with the restrictive terms of ""telehealth"" and ""telemedicine"" was used in keyword searches. Thematic analysis and synthesis of each paper was conducted, aligned to the framework developed by Beauchamp and Childress. RESULTS: From the 49 papers reviewed, authors identified or discussed the following ethical principles in relation to telehealth practice: autonomy (69% of authors, 34/49), professional-patient relationship (53% of authors, 26/49), nonmaleficence (41% of authors, 20/49), beneficence (39%, of authors, 19/49), and justice (39% of authors, 19/49). CONCLUSIONS: Although a small number of studies identified ethical issues associated with telehealth practice and discussed their potential impact on service quality and effectiveness, there is limited research on how ethical principles are incorporated into clinical practice. Several studies proposed frameworks, codes of conduct, or guidelines, but there was little discussion or evidence of how these recommendations are being used to improve ethical telehealth practice.","Keenan, Amanda Jane; Tsourtos, George; Tieman, Jennifer",J Med Internet Res,407,23

Currently, no efficacious therapy is available to relieve coronavirus infections. As new drug design and development takes much time, there is a possibility to find an effective treatment from existing antiviral agents. OBJECTIVE: In this case, there is a need to find out the relationship between possible drug targets and mechanism of action of antiviral drugs. This review discusses about the efforts to develop drug from known or new molecules. METHODS: Viruses usually have two structural integrities, proteins and nucleic acids, both of which can be possible drug targets. Herein, we systemically discuss the structural-functional relationships of the spike, 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), papain like protease (PLpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), as these are prominent structural features of corona virus. Certain antiviral drugs such as Remdesivir are RNA dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor. It has the ability to terminate RNA replication by inhibiting ATP. RESULTS: It is reported that ATP is involved in synthesis of coronavirus non-structural proteins from 3CLpro and PLpro. Similarly, mechanisms of action of many other antiviral agents has been discussed in this review. It will provide new insights into the mechanism of inhibition, and let us develop new therapeutic antiviral approaches against novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 75 young patients (46 males and 29 females, mean age 23.95±2.9 years) were divided into three groups of 25 individuals. The first group was composed of non-smoking patients using toothpaste with NovaMin. The second group (reference group) comprised patients using placebo toothpaste. The third group was composed of smoking patients using toothpaste with NovaMin. The clinical trials of patients included assessment of functional activity of minor salivary glands, the sialometric analysis, the study on microcrystallization of mixed saliva. The non-specific resistance of oral cavity was studied based on the analysis of absorption reaction of microorganisms by epithelial cells. All patients were questioned about the organoleptic characteristics of the toothpaste. The abovementioned features were assessed before the study, after the first use of the toothpaste, after day 7 and day 14. RESULTS: The course use of toothpaste with NovaMin resulted in the plaque inhibiting effect (p&#8804;0.05), increased functional activity of minor salivary glands (p&#8804;0.05) promoting increased salivation and oral cavity cleansing. The concept of local recovery of the receptor apparatus of epithelial cells is confirmed for the first group of patients; the non-specific resistance in tobacco users is low, prevalence of Type I epithelial cells is defined (p&#8804;0.05). CONCLUSION: The evaluated toothpaste affects metabolism in the oral cavity because it was diagnosed that the non-specific resistance of the oral cavity and absorption by epithelia improved in all patients after the course use.","Elovikova, T M; Sablina, S N; Ermishina, E Y; Koscheev, A S",Stomatologiia (Mosk),407,24

Defining the epidemiological aspects and factors influencing the susceptibility of the patients to COVID-19 has been an ongoing struggle. In the present study, we have investigated the connection between ABO histo-blood group phenotypes and the COVID-19. Methods: This study was conducted on 397 patients with confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19 admitted to our center. Also, 500 individuals were selected to form the controls, all of whom had been disclosed to the same medical center in June 2019, before the onset of the outbreak. Results: Our results demonstrated ABO histo-blood phenotypes are correlated with patients’ susceptibility to the infection. A higher rate of infection was observed among patients with the AB histo-blood group, while patients with the O histo-blood group have shown a lower rate of infection. The Rh blood group phenotype was not statistically significant in determining a patient’s vulnerability. Conclusion: Similar to several previous studies about other viral diseases’ association with ABO histo-blood groups, we have concluded that an individual’s ABO histo-blood group phenotype and his/her susceptibility to COVID-19 are indeed connected. So far, only one research has been conducted about this association. Interestingly, while we observed a decreased vulnerability to the disease among patients with an O histo-blood group, we have reached discordant results regarding the increased susceptibility among individuals with an AB histo-blood group, unlike A histo-blood group in the previous study.","Abdollahi, Alireza; Mahmoudi-Aliabadi, Maedeh; Mehrtash, Vahid; Jafarzadeh, Bita; Salehi, Mohammadreza",Iran.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the presence of cerebral microbleeds and their distribution are related to the integrity of white matter microstructures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study comprised 982 participants who underwent brain MR imaging to determine microbleed status. The cross-sectional relation between microbleeds and the microstructural integrity of the white matter was assessed by 2 statistical methods: a multilinear regression model based on the average DTI parameters of normal-appearing white matter and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics analysis, a tract-based voxelwise analysis. Fiber tractography was used to spatially describe the microstructural abnormalities along WM tracts containing a cerebral microbleed. RESULTS: The presence of cerebral microbleeds was associated with lower mean fractional anisotropy and higher mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity, and the association remained when cardiovascular risk factors and cerebral small-vessel disease markers were further adjusted. Tract-Based Spatial Statistics analysis indicated strictly lobar cerebral microbleeds associated with lower fractional anisotropy, higher mean diffusivity, and higher radial diffusivity in the internal capsule and corpus callosum after adjusting other cerebral small-vessel disease markers, while only a few voxels remained associated with deep cerebral microbleeds. Diffusion abnormalities gradients along WM tracts containing a cerebral microbleed were not found in fiber tractography analysis.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis from March 9, 2020 to June 20, 2020. SETTING: Population-based study in Louisville, KY, USA. PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred adult inpatients hospitalized with COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: This cohort consisted of 126 patients (18%) with cardiovascular events and 574 patients without cardiovascular events. Patients with cardiovascular events had a much higher mortality rate than those without cardiovascular events (45.2% v 8.7%, p < 0.001). There was no difference between African American and white patients regarding mortality (43.9% v 46.3%, p = 1) and length of stay for survivors (11 days v 9.5 days, pâ¯=â¯0.301). Multiple logistics regression analysis suggested that male, race, lower SaO2/FIO2, higher serum potassium, lower serum albumin, and number of cardiovascular comorbidities were highly associated with the occurrence of cardiovascular events in COVID-19 patients. Lower serum albumin and neoplastic and/or immune-compromised diseases were highly associated with cardiovascular events for African American COVID-19 patients. SaO2/FIO2 ratio and cardiovascular comorbidity count were significantly associated with cardiovascular events in white patients. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular events were prevalent and associated with worse outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Outcomes of cardiovascular events in African American and white COVID-19 patients were similar after propensity score matching analysis. There were common and unique risk factors for cardiovascular events in African American COVID-19 patients when compared with white patients.","Xu, Qian; Samanapally, Harideep; Nathala, Pavani; Salunkhe, Vidyulata; Furmanek, Stephen; Cahill, Meredith N; McGuffin, Trevor; Mohammad, Tahboub; Marsili, Bradford; Petrey, Jessica; Carrico, Ruth; Ramirez, Julio; Akca, Ozan; Clifford, Sean P; Pahwa, Siddharth; Roser, Lynn; Kong, Maiying; Huang, Jiapeng",J. cardiothoracic vasc. anest,407,16

In particular, the intensity-modulated radiation therapy technique-that allows treating irregular and inhomogeneous tumors while reducing the radiation toxicity on healthy organs-is based on the optimization problem of the beamlets intensities that shall result in a maximal delivery of the therapy dose to cancer while avoiding the organs at risk of being damaged by the radiation. The resulting optimization problem is expressed as a cost function to be optimized. Here, we map the cost function into an Ising-like Hamiltonian, describing a system of long-range interacting qubits. Finally, we solve the dose optimization problem by finding the ground-state of the Hamiltonian using a Tree Tensor Network algorithm. In particular, we present an anatomical scenario exemplifying a prostate cancer treatment. A similar approach can be applied to future hybrid classical-quantum algorithms, paving the way for the use of quantum technologies in future medical treatments.","Cavinato, Samuele; Felser, Timo; Fusella, Marco; Paiusco, Marta; Montangero, Simone",Phys. med. biol,407,1

No obstante, han surtido efecto en lograr el descenso de casos activos de COVID-19. Chile ha comenzado la desescalada y precisa conocer el mejor momento para poner fin a las restricciones. Objetivos Discutir las mejores condiciones y garantías para el fin del confinamiento obligatorio sobre la base de los casos nuevos, casos activos y positividad de exámenes de reacción en cadena de la polimerasa. Métodos Estudio basado en un modelo de tendencia con estimación de predicciones. Los datos de las variables de interés fueron sometidas a estudios de regresión lineal, con el objeto de determinar la curva que mejor explicaba los datos. Se estimó el coeficiente de determinación, la desviación estándar de y en x y el intervalo de confianza de la curva observada. Posteriormente, fue escogida la curva de tendencia en concordancia con las estimaciones de regresión. Resultados Se encontró que todas las variables dependientes tendían a disminuir con el tiempo de forma cuadrática, con excepción de la variable casos nuevos. En general, las estimaciones de coeficiente de determinación (R2) y error porcentual absoluto medio son satisfactorias, con excepción de la variable: número de exámenes de reacción en cadena de la polimerasa por día. Conclusiones Se deben tomar medidas graduales y cautelosas antes de poner fin al confinamiento obligatorio. En la actual desescalada, se deben aumentar los exámenes de reacción en cadena de la polimerasa diarios y mantener vigilancia en los indicadores de incidencia, prevalencia y positividad de dichos exámenes. La evidencia sugiere con cierto grado de confiabilidad que el confinamiento obligatorio podría levantarse de forma segura a contar del día 30 de agosto de 2020.

Therefore, the objective of this review is to summarize emerging evidence on the vertical transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and CENTRAL. Likewise, a search for preprint publications was conducted using MedRxiv and Research Square. Studies that addressed vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (concept) among pregnant women infected by Covid-19 (population) in any setting (community, hospital, or home) in any country or context were considered for inclusion. Any types of studies or reports published between December 2019 and September 2020 addressing the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on pregnant women and their newborn babies were included. Studies were screened for eligibility against the inclusion criteria for the review by two reviewers. RESULTS: We identified 51 studies reporting 336 newborns screened for COVID-19. From the 336 newborns screened for COVID-19, only 15 (4.4%) were positive for throat swab RT-PCR. All neonates with positive throat swab RT-PCR were delivered by cesarean section. Among neonates with throat swab SARS-CoV-2 positive only five (33.3%) had concomitant placenta, amniotic fluid, and cord blood samples tested, of which only one amniotic fluid sample is positive for RT PCR. Five neonates had elevated IgG and IgM but without intrauterine tissue tested. Four neonates had chest imaging suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Currently there is not enough evidence on vertical virologic transmission of COVID-19 infection during the third trimester of pregnancy. Additionally, there is no evidence to support cesarean delivery, abstaining from breast feeding nor mother and infant separation. Further research involving an adequate sample size of breast milk, placenta, amniotic fluid, and cord blood to ascertain the possibility of vertical transmission and breast milk transfer is needed.","Tolu, Lemi Belay; Ezeh, Alex; Feyissa, Garumma Tolu",PLoS One,407,16

Importations of SARS-CoV-2 to Israel in late February from multiple countries initiated a rapid outbreak across the country. In this study, SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes were sequenced from 59 imported samples with a recorded country of importation and 101 early circulating samples in February to mid-March 2020 and analyzed to infer clades and mutational patterns with additional sequences identified Israel available in public databases. Recorded importations in February to mid-March, mostly from Europe, led to multiple transmissions in all districts in Israel. Although all SARS-CoV-2 defined clades were imported, clade 20C became the dominating clade in the circulating samples. Identification of novel, frequently altered mutated positions correlating with clade-defining positions provide data for surveillance of this evolving pandemic and spread of specific clades of this virus. SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread and mutate in Israel and across the globe. With economy and travel resuming, surveillance of clades and accumulating mutations is crucial for understanding its evolution and spread patterns and may aid in decision making concerning public health issues.","Zuckerman, Neta S; Bucris, Efrat; Drori, Yaron; Erster, Oran; Sofer, Danit; Pando, Rakefet; Mendelson, Ella; Mor, Orna; Mandelboim, Michal",PLoS One,407,24

It is difficult to foresee the future length and severity; it may be weeks, months, or even years that could deplete the energy and resources of the health care facilities and the providers as there is marginal to no pharmacological medication available to treat the Covid-19. Unless an effective pharmacological treatment such as medicines and vaccines is developed and released publicly, wearing protective face masks and protecting personal health and hygiene is merely a choice to avoid the Covid-19 spread. This review summarizes the background knowledge on the Covid-19 disease and currently available face masks for highly infectious disease primary prevention. According to recent studies onf Covid-19 prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, nanotechnologists have provided a revolutionary approach that involves both pharmacological and non-pharmacological steps, one of which is the use of nanofibers in facemasks and respirators. METHOD: Various research carried out in the field of nano masks and patented reports based on the application of nano masks were reviewed.

The study investigated (1) the associations between individual perception of perceived response efficacy and social distancing behaviors, (2) the association between social value of perceived freedom infringement and social distancing behaviors, and (3) whether perceived freedom infringement would moderate the association between perceived response efficacy and social distancing behaviors. METHODS: A cross-sectional telephone survey interviewed 300 adults in the Hong Kong adult general population during April 21-28, 2020. The instruments of social distancing behaviors, perceived response efficacy, and perceived freedom infringement assessed the frequencies of practicing seven types of social distancing behaviors in the past week, perceived response efficacy of four types of governmental social distancing measures/instructions, and a 5-point Likert scale item on perceived infringement on personal freedom regarding a governmental social distancing measure of banning gatherings of >4 people in public areas. Linear regression adjusted for background factors was performed; the interaction term of perceived response efficacy × perceived freedom infringement was tested. RESULTS: About 40.4%-83.0% of the respondents practiced various types of social distancing behaviors; 57.3%-75.0% perceived response efficacies of related governmental measures; about 20% showed perceived freedom infringement. Perceived response efficacy, but not perceived freedom infringement, was independently and positively associated with social distancing behaviors. Perceived freedom infringement significantly moderated the association between perceived response efficacy and social distancing behaviors; such a positive association was significant at higher (those scored ""extremely agree""), but not lower (those scored ""extremely disagree""), levels of perceived freedom infringement. CONCLUSION: Perceived response efficacy is a potential determinant of social distancing. However, the strength of such an association may be modified by opposing social values about personal freedom. Future studies are warranted to verify above findings and explore other potential determinants.","Yu, Yanqiu; Lau, Joseph Tak Fai; Lau, Mason Man Chun",Int. j. health policy manag,407,24

We applied this methodology to Barcelona to analyze the distribution of the demand for elderly care services. Thus, we obtained a deeper understanding of how the demand for elderly care is dispersed throughout the city. Considering the characteristics that were likely to impact the demand for homecare in the neighborhoods, we clearly identified five groups of neighborhoods with different profiles and needs.

Recently, MSCs have attracted attention to treating untreatable viral infections such as severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Given that the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are directly able to detect internal and external hazard signals, and their stimulation has an intense effect on the ability to grow, differentiate, migrate, and maintain MSCs, it seems stimulation of these receptors can have a direct impact on the interaction of MSCs and immune cells, altering the ability to modify immune system responses. Hence, this mini-review focused on TLRs' critical roles in the polarization of MSCs for developing MSC-based therapy in viral infections. Consequently, according to the literature review, a polarization process, mediated by TLRs concerning anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory phenotype, may be considered for MSC-therapy against viral infections.","Gholizadeh-Ghaleh Aziz, Shiva; Alipour, Shahriar; Ranjbarvan, Parviz; Azari, Arezo; Babaei, Ghader; Golchin, Ali",Comp Clin Path,407,26

Our findings show that, controlling for the population density and the percentage of older adults in the population, there is a significant positive association between the number of long-term care beds per capita and COVID-19 mortality rates. This finding provides support for the claim that long-term care living arrangements (of older people) are a significant risk factor for dying from COVID-19.","Gandal, Neil; Yonas, Matan; Feldman, Michal; Pauzner, Ady; Tabbach, Avraham",,407,13

HYPOTHESIS: Type 2 MI/Myocardial Injury are associated with worse outcomes if complicated by COVID-19. METHODS: This longitudinal cohort study involved consecutive patients admitted to a large urban hospital. Myocardial injury was determined using laboratory records as &#8805;1 hs-TnI result >99th percentile (male: >34 ng/L; female: >16 ng/L). Endotypes were defined according to the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (MI) and COVID-19 determined using PCR. Outcomes of patients with myocardial injury with and without COVID-19 were assessed. RESULTS: Of 346 hospitalized patients with elevated hs-TnI, 35 (10.1%) had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (median age [IQR]; 65 [59-74]; 64.8% male vs. COVID-19 negative: 74 [63-83] years; 43.7% male). Cardiac endotypes by COVID-19 status (yes vs. no) were: Type 1 MI (0 [0%] vs. 115 [100%]; p < .0005), Type 2 MI (13 [16.5%] vs. 66 [83.5%]; p = .045), and non-ischemic myocardial injury (cardiac: 4 [5.8%] vs. 65 [94.2%]; p = .191, non-cardiac:19 [22.9%] vs. 64 [77.%]; p < .0005).

Patients and methods: Single center retrospective observational study. All patients hospitalized, at Delta Regional Medical Center, regional hospital in the Mississippi Delta, with a COVID-19 diagnosis and discharged between March 1st and September 30th, 2020 are included. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality in relation to receipt of tofacitinib alone or in addition to dexamethasone (designated as the Tofacitinib Group), vs dexamethasone alone (designated as the Dexamethasone Group). Results: Of 269 eligible patients, 138 (51.3%) received tofacitinib uniformly and 131 (48.7%) patients received dexamethasone without tofacitinib. A total of 44 patients expired: 14 (31.82%) in the Tofacitinib Group and 30 (68.18%) in the Dexamethasone Group. The proportions of death among the Tofacitinib and Dexamethasone groups were respectively, 10.14% and 22.90%. This represents a 70% reduction in odds of dying among the Tofacitinib group compared to the Dexamethasone group after adjusting for age and clinical parameters captured at hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio=0.30, 95% confidence interval =0.12-0.76; p=0.01). Conclusions: The in-patient treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia has rapidly evolved. The addition of dexamethasone has made a relevant improvement on survival. Other immunomodulators are yet to show an impact. Here we present the potential survival benefit of the JAK-STAT inhibitor tofacitinib on COVID-19 pneumonia. We found that adding tofacitinib based anti-inflammatory therapy to a treatment regimen including dexamethasone in COVID-19 pneumonia seems to have potential benefit of improving survival when compared to dexamethasone alone.","Hayek, Maroun E; Mansour, Michael; Ndetan, Harrison; Burkes, Quentin; Corkren, Robert; Dulli, Ammar; Hayek, Reya; Parvez, Karim; Singh, Satwinder",,407,30

We aimed to evaluate and compare the positive rate with molecular POC tests and DIAs in detecting influenza virus A, B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in 2019-2020. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from adult outpatients with influenza-like illness who visited four hospitals and clinics in Japan. DIAs were performed at each facility. The clinical diagnosis was determined based on the findings of DIAs, history taking, and physical assessment. Molecular POC test and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were performed later. RESULTS: A total of 182 patients were evaluated. The positive rate for influenza virus with molecular POC test was significantly higher than that with DIAs (51.6% versus 40.7%, p = 0.046). In patients who tested positive for influenza virus with only molecular POC test, the presence of influenza virus was confirmed by RT-PCR. In a comparison between the patients who were positive for influenza virus with only molecular POC test and those with both molecular POC test and DIA, the percentage of patients who sought consultation within 18 h after the onset of symptoms was significantly higher in the molecular POC test only group than in the both methods group (70.0% versus 43.2%, p = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS: A molecular POC test could contribute to the accurate diagnosis of influenza in patients with influenza-like illness, especially those who visited a hospital immediately after the onset of symptoms.","Kaku, Norihito; Kodama, Hina; Akamatsu, Norihiko; Ota, Kenji; Kosai, Kosuke; Morinaga, Yoshitomo; Narita, Yusuke; Matsumoto, Yasushi; Matsushita, Tetsuro; Mizuta, Yohei; Izumikawa, Koichi; Mukae, Hiroshi; Yanagihara, Katsunori",J Infect Chemother,407,20

Methods: We included 1,590 hospitalized COVID-19 patients confirmed by real-time RT-PCR assay or high-throughput sequencing of pharyngeal and nasal swab specimens from 575 hospitals across China between 11 December 2019 and 31 January 2020. Times from symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis, from symptom onset to first medical visit and from first medical visit to confirmed diagnosis were described and turned into binary variables by the maximally selected rank statistics method. Then, survival analysis, including a log-rank test, Cox regression, and conditional inference tree (CTREE) was conducted, regarding whether patients progressed to a severe disease level during the observational period (assessed as severe pneumonia according to the Chinese Expert Consensus on Clinical Practice for Emergency Severe Pneumonia, admission to an intensive care unit, administration of invasive ventilation, or death) as the prognosis outcome, the dependent variable. Independent factors included whether the time from symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis was longer than 5 days (the exposure) and other demographic and clinical factors as multivariate adjustments. The clinical characteristics of the patients with different times from symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis were also compared. Results: The medians of the times from symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis, from symptom onset to first medical visit, and from first medical visit to confirmed diagnosis were 6, 3, and 2 days. After adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, and comorbidity status, age [hazard ratio (HR): 1.03;95% CI: 1.01–1.04], comorbidity (HR: 1.84;95% CI: 1.23–2.73), and a duration from symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis of &gt;5 days (HR: 1.69;95% CI: 1.10–2.60) were independent predictors of COVID-19 prognosis, which echoed the CTREE models, with significant nodes such as time from symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis, age, and comorbidities. Males, older patients with symptoms such as dry cough/productive cough/shortness of breath, and prior COPD were observed more often in the patients who procrastinated before initiating the first medical consultation. Conclusions: A longer time from symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis yielded a worse COVID-19 prognosis.","Chen, Y. J.; Jian, W. H.; Liang, Z. Y.; Guan, W. J.; Liang, W. H.; Chen, R. C.; Tang, C.

Despite the severity of this illness and 2.3 million worldwide deaths, the disease mechanism is mostly unknown. Previous studies that characterized differential gene expression due to SARS-CoV-2 infection lacked robust validation. Although vaccines are now available, effective treatment options are still out of reach. RESULTS: To characterize the transcriptional activity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a gene signature consisting of 25 genes was generated using a publicly available RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) dataset of cultured cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. The signature estimated infection level accurately in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy and infected patients (mean 0.001 vs. 0.958; P < 0.0001). These signature genes were investigated in their ability to distinguish the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a single-cell RNA-Sequencing dataset. TNFAIP3, PPP1R15A, NFKBIA, and IFIT2 had shown bimodal gene expression in various immune cells from severely infected patients compared to healthy or moderate infection cases. Finally, this signature was assessed using the publicly available ConnectivityMap database to identify potential disease mechanisms and drug repurposing candidates. Pharmacological classes of tricyclic antidepressants, SRC-inhibitors, HDAC inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, and drugs such as atorvastatin, ibuprofen, and ketoconazole showed strong negative associations (connectivity score < - 90), highlighting the need for further evaluation of these candidates for their efficacy in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, using the 25-gene SARS-CoV-2 infection signature, the SARS-CoV-2 infection status was captured in BALF cells, PBMCs and postmortem lung biopsies. In addition, candidate SARS-CoV-2 therapies with known safety profiles were identified. The signature genes could potentially also be used to characterize the COVID-19 disease severity in patients' expression profiles of BALF cells.","Li, Yue; Duche, Ashley; Sayer, Michael R; Roosan, Don; Khalafalla, Farid G; Ostrom, Rennolds S; Totonchy, Jennifer; Roosan, Moom R",BMC Genomics,407,32

411974,411974,411974,Noise complaints during a pandemic: A longitudinal analysis,15.643689,4.5634847,2021,"Background: From the first detection in 2019, SARS-CoV-2 infections have spread rapidly worldwide and have been proven to cause an urgent and important health problem. SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on two proteins present on the surface of host cells, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). The nasal cavity is thought to be one of the initial sites of infection and a possible reservoir for dissemination within and between individuals. However, it is not known how the expression of these genes is regulated in the nasal mucosa. Objective: In this study, we examined whether the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is affected by innate immune signals in the nasal mucosa. We also investigated how fluticasone propionate (FP), a corticosteroid used as an intranasal steroid spray, affects the gene expression. Methods: Primary human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) were collected from the nasal mucosa and incubated with Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists and/or fluticasone propionate (FP), followed by quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence, and immunoblot analyses. Results: Among the TLR agonists, the TLR3 agonist Poly(I:C) significantly increased ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in HNECs (ACE2 36.212±11.600-fold change, p<0.0001; TMPRSS2 5.598±2.434-fold change, p=0.031). The ACE2 protein level was also increased with Poly(I:C) stimulation (2.884±0.505-fold change, p=0.003). The Poly(I:C)-induced ACE2 expression was suppressed by co-incubation with FP (0.405±0.312-fold change, p=0.044). Conclusion: The activation of innate immune signals via TLR3 promotes the expression of genes related to SARS-CoV2 cell entry in the nasal mucosa, although this expression is suppressed in the presence of FP. Further studies are required to evaluate whether FP suppresses SARS-CoV-2 viral cell entry.","Nakazono, Akira; Nakamaru, Yuji; Ramezanpour, Mahnaz; Kondo, Takeshi; Watanabe, Masashi; Hatakeyama, Shigetsugu; Kimura, Shogo; Honma, Aya; Wormald, P J; Vreugde, Sarah; Suzuki, Masanobu; Homma, Akihiro",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,407,1

The objective of our study is to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on the incidence of cancer diagnoses in primary care. DESIGN: Time-series study of malignant neoplasms and diagnostic procedures, using data from the primary care electronic health records from January 2014 to September 2020. SETTING: Primary care, Catalonia, Spain. PARTICIPANTS: People older than 14 years and assigned in one of the primary care practices of the Catalan Institute of Health with a new diagnosis of malignant neoplasm. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We obtained the monthly expected incidence of malignant neoplasms using a temporary regression, where the response variable was the incidence of cancer from 2014 to 2018 and the adjustment variables were the trend and seasonality of the time series. Excess or lack of malignant neoplasms was defined as the number of observed minus expected cases, globally and stratified by sex, age, type of cancer and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: Between March and September 2020 we observed 8766 (95% CI 4135 to 13 397) fewer malignant neoplasm diagnoses, representing a reduction of 34% (95% CI 19.5% to 44.1%) compared with the expected. This underdiagnosis was greater in individuals aged older than 64 years, men and in some types of cancers (skin, colorectal, prostate). Although the reduction was predominantly focused during the lockdown, expected figures have not yet been reached (40.5% reduction during the lockdown and 24.3% reduction after that). CONCLUSIONS: Reduction in cancer incidence has been observed during and after the lockdown. Urgent policy interventions are necessary to mitigate the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related control measures on other diseases and some strategies must be designed in order to reduce the underdiagnosis of cancer.","Coma, Ermengol; Guiriguet, Carolina; Mora, Nuria; Marzo-Castillejo, Mercè; Benítez, Mencia; Méndez-Boo, Leonardo; Fina, Francesc; Fàbregas, Mireia; Mercadé, Albert; Medina, Manuel",BMJ Open,407,12

Social distancing has been proved to be an effective practice to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Against this backdrop, we propose that the surveillance robots can not only monitor but also promote social distancing. Robots can be flexibly deployed and they can take precautionary actions to remind people of practicing social distancing. In this paper, we introduce a fully autonomous surveillance robot based on a quadruped platform that can promote social distancing in complex urban environments. Specifically, to achieve autonomy, we mount multiple cameras and a 3D LiDAR on the legged robot. The robot then uses an onboard real-time social distancing detection system to track nearby pedestrian groups. Next, the robot uses a crowd-aware navigation algorithm to move freely in highly dynamic scenarios. The robot finally uses a crowd-aware routing algorithm to effectively promote social distancing by using human-friendly verbal cues to send suggestions to over-crowded pedestrians. We demonstrate and validate that our robot can be operated autonomously by conducting several experiments in various urban scenarios.","Fan, Tingxiang; Chen, Zhiming; Zhao, Xuan; Liang, Jing; Shen, Cong; Manocha, Dinesh; Pan, Jia; Zhang, Wei",,407,1

March 9, 2020, and then increased rapidly with total cases of 25,739 as of April 20, 2020. The Covid-19 pandemic is so unnerving that it is difficult to understand how any person is affected by the virus. Although most people with coronavirus 81%, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), will have little to mild symptoms, others may rely on a ventilator to breathe or not at all. SEIR models have broad applicability in predicting the outcome of the population with a variety of diseases. However, many researchers use these models without validating the necessary hypotheses. Far too many researchers often""overfit""the data by using too many predictor variables and small sample sizes to create models. Models thus developed are unlikely to stand validity check on a separate group of population and regions. The researcher remains unaware that overfitting has occurred, without attempting such validation. In the paper, we present a combination algorithm that combines similar days features selection based on the region using Xgboost, K Means, and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to construct a prediction model (i.e., K-Means-LSTM) for short-term COVID-19 cases forecasting in Louisana state USA. The weighted k-means algorithm based on extreme gradient boosting is used to evaluate the similarity between the forecasts and past days. The results show that the method with K-Means-LSTM has a higher accuracy with an RMSE of 601.20 whereas the SEIR model with an RMSE of 3615.83.","Vadyala, Shashank Reddy; Betgeri, Sai Nethra; Sherer, Eric A.; Amritphale, Amod",,407,26

Mortality attributable to COVID-19 in Denmark increased steeply, and peaked in 2020-W14. As preventive measures and national lockdown were implemented from 2020-W12, the attributable mortality started declining within a few weeks. Mortality attributable to COVID-19 from 2020-W09 to 2020-W20 was estimated to 16.2 (95% confidence interval (CI): 12.0 to 20.4) per 100,000 person-years. The 2019/20 influenza season was mild with few deaths attributable to influenza, 3.2 (95% CI: 1.1 to 5.4) per 100,000 person-years.ConclusionAttMOMO estimates mortality attributable to several pathogens simultaneously, providing a fuller picture of mortality by COVID-19 during the pandemic in the context of other seasonal diseases and mortality patterns. Using Danish data, we show that the model accurately estimates mortality attributable to COVID-19 and influenza, respectively. We propose using standardised indicators for pathogen circulation in the population, to make estimates comparable between countries and applicable for timely monitoring.","Nielsen, Jens; Rod, Naja Hulvej; Vestergaard, Lasse S; Lange, Theis",Euro surveill,407,16

Methods A descriptive study was carried out using an administrative database of the military hospital, we used a validated algorithm that classifies patients as having SLE in administrative databases. Infection was defined as an event with main diagnosis using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) coding algorithm or by searching the antibiotics prescription database, additionally, we abstracted some variables related to SLE status in the group of patients in whom infections were documented during the infection event. Results 237 SLE patients were identified. The mean age was 41.9 years (CI 29.0–54.3), 80% were female, 97.7% used conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Of these 237 patients, 22 (9.4%) met the operative definition of infection, in this group the mean age was 44.3 years (SD 16.4). All the 22 patients received conventional DMARDs and none of them had concomitant biologic therapy. In this group of patients, the most common type of infection was bacterial (72.7%), followed by viral (9.1%) including a patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusion Hospital administrative databases can be a useful source of information for monitoring outcomes that generate significant morbidity and mortality in patients with SLE, in the group of patients in whom infections were documented, bacterial infections were the most frequent. The most documented clinical findings were leukopenia, systemic steroid therapy, and concomitant disease activity. Resumen Objetivo Estimar la frecuencia de las infecciones y describir su patrón de presentación en pacientes con diagnóstico de lupus eritematoso sistémico (LES) atendidos en el Hospital Militar Central (Homil) en Bogotá, Colombia. Métodos Se realizó un estudio descriptivo en el que se utilizó una base de datos administrativa del Hospital Militar y se empleó un algoritmo validado que clasificó a los pacientes con LES en las bases de datos administrativas. La infección se definió a partir de los códigos CIE-10 o por la búsqueda en la base de datos de la prescripción de antibióticos;adicionalmente, en las historias clínicas del grupo de pacientes en los que se documentaron infecciones, se revisaron algunas variables relacionadas con el estado de LES durante el evento de la infección. Resultados Se identificaron 237 pacientes con LES, cuya edad media fue de 41,9 años (IC 29,0-54,3), el 80% eran mujeres y el 97,7% usaba medicamentos antirreumáticos modificadores de la enfermedad (DMARD) convencionales. De estos 237 pacientes, 22 (9,4%) cumplieron con la definición operativa de infección;en este grupo la edad media fue de 44,3 años (DE = 16,4).

There are no detailed data on the possible changes in the epidemiology and treatment of DRFs in children and adults during the Covid pandemic. The purpose of our study was a comprehensive assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on distal radius fractures (DRF) epidemiology, including both children and adults and various fracture fixation methods in two large trauma centers in Poland. METHODS: This study compared the medical data on the treatment of distal radius fractures in Poland in two periods: the period of the COVID-19 pandemic (from March 15 to October 15, 2020) and the corresponding period prior to the pandemic (from March 15 to October 15, 2019). We assessed detailed data from two trauma centers for pediatric and adult patients. Outpatients seeking medical attention at emergency departments and inpatients undergoing surgery at trauma-orthopedic wards were evaluated. We compared epidemiological data, demographic data, treatment type, and hospital stay duration. RESULTS: The total number of patients hospitalized due to DRF during the pandemic was 180, it was 15.1% lower than that from the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period (212). In the case of adult patients, the total number of those hospitalized during the pandemic decreased significantly (by 22%) from 132 to 103 patients. Analysis of the individual treatment methods revealed that the number of adults who underwent conservative treatment was considerably (by 30.3%) significantly lower in the period of the COVID-19 pandemic, from 119 to 83 patients. Compared to 13 patients from the pre-pandemic period, the number of surgically treated adults statistically increased to 20 patients (by 53.8%). Our analyses showed hospitalizations of surgically treated adults to be shorter by 12.7% during the pandemic, with the corresponding hospitalizations of surgically treated pediatric patients to be shorter by11.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the epidemiology and treatment of DRFs in children and adults. We found decreased numbers of pediatric and adult patients with DRFs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic caused an increase in the number of children and significantly increase adults undergoing surgical treatment for DRFs, a decrease in mean patient age, shorter significantly length of hospital stay, and an increased number of men with DRFs.","Olech, Jaroslaw; Ciszewski, Mariusz; Morasiewicz, Piotr",BMC Musculoskelet Disord,407,26

COVID-19 precaution measures are essential for highly susceptible groups. However, it was not known previously to what extent chronic disease patients were perceived to know about the efficacy of prevention measures. Hence, the aim of this study was to assess perception of patients with chronic disease toward the efficacy of COVID-19 preventive measures and their intention to carry out those measures. Methods: A multicentered institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 413 patients attended in selected hospitals of Dessie town from July 21 to August 5, 2020. Hospitals were selected using the lottery method and systematic random sampling was utilized to select study participants. An interviewer-administered structured questionnaire was used to collect the data and the tool had four dimensions which include sociodemographic, clinical profile and risk assessment, perceived efficacy of prevention measures, and patient's intention to carry out measures. In multivariable analysis, variables were declared statistically significant at a p-value of &lt;0.05. Results: In this study, the mean age of participants was 48.2 years (SD +/-15.8 years) and 52.1% were females. In overall, 42.1% of participants had low perception on the efficacy of prevention measures and 28.3% had low intention to carry out measures.

Conclusion: In this study, a significant proportion of patients had low perception about the efficacy of COVID-19 prevention measures and nearly one-third of them had low intention to carry out prevention measures. Therefore, health education programs about efficacy of preventive measures should be provided by health professionals targeting high risk groups.","Dires, A.; Gedamu, S.; Getachew, Y.",Journal of multidisciplinary healthcare,407,20

DESIGN: A 21-day diary study was conducted between late March and late April 2020 in Germany. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hypotheses were tested in a sample of 561 participants (Mage = 42.79, SDage = 6.12). Every evening, participants indicated their exposure to COVID-19-related media (e.g., TV, print, online) and their COVID-19-related worries. RESULTS: Same-day analyses showed that participants reported more COVID-19-related worries on days with higher exposure to COVID-19-related media. Dynamical structural equation models provided evidence for a reciprocal cycle across days: Higher media exposure at one day predicted higher worries the next day, and higher worries at one day also predicted higher media exposure the next day. Individuals with high trait anxiety reported an enhanced general level of media exposure during the 21 days of assessment, and individuals high in neuroticism and anxiety reported an enhanced level of worries. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a self-reinforcing cycle whereby consuming crisis-related media and worrying reciprocally influence each other across days, possibly amplifying adverse effects of the COVID-19 crisis and other crises alike on mental and physical health.","Schmidt, Andrea; Brose, Annette; Kramer, Andrea C; Schmiedek, Florian; Witthöft, Michael; Neubauer, Andreas B",Psychol Health,407,26

However, these new programs run the risk of paying insufficient attention to the multiple sustainability crises we face. Climate change, in particular, threatens the very basis for continued human prosperity and requires an equal, if not greater, societal mobilization. In this policy brief, we argue that the response to the coronavirus outbreak also offers an opportunity to advance the climate agenda. Indeed, given that we have scarce resources at our disposal, it is essential that we synergize such efforts. We propose that this can be accomplished in two primary ways: (1) harnessing the disruptive forces of the COVID-19 pandemic to accelerate the decline of carbon-intensive industries, technologies, and practices, and (2) leveraging responses to drive low-carbon innovation. From these two strategies, we outline five principles of “sustainability transition policy” to serve as a guide during these challenging times.","Markard, Jochen; Rosenbloom, Daniel",Sustainability Sci.

We conducted a nation-wide survey of all heart transplant centers in Germany presenting the clinical characteristics of heart transplant recipients with COVID-19 during the first months of the pandemic in Germany. METHODS AND RESULTS: A multicenter survey of all heart transplant centers in Germany evaluating the current status of COVID-19 among adult heart transplant recipients was performed. A total of 21 heart transplant patients with COVID-19 was reported to the transplant centers during the first months of the pandemic in Germany. Mean patient age was 58.6 ± 12.3 years and 81.0% were male. Comorbidities included arterial hypertension (71.4%), dyslipidemia (71.4%), diabetes mellitus (33.3%), chronic kidney failure requiring dialysis (28.6%) and chronic-obstructive lung disease/asthma (19.0%). Most patients received an immunosuppressive drug regimen consisting of a calcineurin inhibitor (71.4%), mycophenolate mofetil (85.7%) and steroids (71.4%). Eight of 21 patients (38.1%) displayed a severe course needing invasive mechanical ventilation. Those patients showed a high mortality (87.5%) which was associated with right ventricular dysfunction (62.5% vs. 7.7%; p = 0.014), arrhythmias (50.0% vs. none; p = 0.012), and thromboembolic events (50.0% vs. none; p = 0.012). Elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T- and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide were significantly associated with the severe form of COVID-19 (p = 0.017 and p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Severe course of COVID-19 was frequent in heart transplanted patients. High mortality was associated with right ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias, thromboembolic events, and markedly elevated cardiac biomarkers.","Rivinius, Rasmus; Kaya, Ziya; Schramm, René; Boeken, Udo; Provaznik, Zdenek; Heim, Christian; Knosalla, Christoph; Schoenrath, Felix; Rieth, Andreas; Berchtold-Herz, Michael; Barten, Markus J; Rauschning, Dominic; Mücke, Victoria T; Heyl, Stephan; Pistulli, Rudin; Grinninger, Carola; Hagl, Christian; Gummert, Jan F; Warnecke, Gregor; Schulze, P Christian; Katus, Hugo A; Kreusser, Michael M; Raake, Philip W",Clin Res Cardiol,407,16

Under normal circumstances, these activities are components of trip chains and utilize a multimodal transport network. The overall performance of the network can be traced through delays in the bus system as buses capture both changes in ridership and fluctuations in mixed traffic conditions. This paper explores the hypothesis that resumption of a single component in trip chains (i.e., school reopening) is sufficient for a measurable change in transport system performance. This study used school reopening in Sydney, Australia as a case study to explore whether school-related trips affected bus system performance directly with higher student patronage or indirectly with heavier road congestion from parental car trips. Both stop dwell times and differences in delays between successive stops were used as bus service indicators. Dwell times reflect the travel demand for buses and delay differences capture local changes in service reliability. We found that increase in ridership had limited impacts on bus punctuality. However, the level of local bus performance worsened after schools reopened, and the effect was more pronounced in commercial areas in the afternoon when schools ended, suggesting secondary trip purposes such as leisure and shopping in addition to school pick-ups. This study revealed the interaction between different trip purposes during the postshutdown period and threw light on changes in travel behavior patterns as travel restrictions were relaxed in pandemic circumstances.","Yan, Wenbo Yao Hudson Chen Linji Rayaprolu Hema Moylan Emily",Transportation Research Record,407,24

The prevalence of COVID-19 in children has been reported much lower than adults. Most patients have mild symptoms, whereas some cases are asymptomatic. Information on the pediatric clinical manifestations is limited; therefore, reporting specific cases can improve the diagnosis process. Case Presentation: In this article, we reported a 12-year-old boy with chickenpox and COVID-19 at the same time. The patient initially had symptoms of chickenpox and then developed pneumonia. The PCR-test for COVID-19 was positive. The IgM test was positive, and IgG was negative. Chickenpox infection was confirmed by the serological test (positive IgM). The radiographic results showed reverse halo sign and vascular enlargement. Conclusions: These imaging findings are uncommon signs of COVID-19 in pediatrics. The patient was treated with hydroxychloro-quine and azithromycin and discharged a few days later with good condition.","Karimi, Abdollah; Tabatabaei, Sedigheh Rafiei; Khalili, Mitra; Sadr, Saeed; Alibeik, Mina; Omidmalayeri, Soheil; Fahimzad, Seyed Alireza; Ghanaiee, Roxana Mansour; Armin, Shahnaz",Arch.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the sources of anxiety and stress in pregnant Japanese women during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed content analysis of 1,000 questions posted on the largest social website in Japan (Yahoo! Chiebukuro) from January 1 to May 25, 2020 (end date of the national state of emergency). Gwet's AC1 coefficient verified interrater reliability. RESULTS: A total 12 categories were identified. Throughout the period studied, anxiety about going out appeared most frequently, followed by anxiety regarding employment and infection in family and friends. Following the declaration of state of emergency at peak infection, infection-related anxiety decreased whereas anxiety about social support and mood disorders increased. Stress regarding relationships appeared frequently throughout the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The sources of anxiety and stress in pregnant women in Japan changed during the pandemic. Our results suggest the need for rapid communications in the early phase of a pandemic as well as long-term psychosocial support, to best support pregnant women in Japan. Healthcare professionals should understand the changing pattern of need in pregnant women.","Shirabe, Ritsuko; Okuhara, Tsuyoshi; Yokota, Rie; Okada, Hiroko; Goto, Eiko; Kiuchi, Takahiro",,407,16

Whether such disparities extend to patients with ESKD, who simultaneously are at risk for complications of infection and have extensive contact with health care providers, has not been investigated. METHODS: To determine whether the proportion of patients vaccinated at a dialysis facility differs according to the facility's racial and ethnic composition, we examined dialysis facility data reported to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The main outcome was the proportion of facility patients vaccinated for influenza among 6735 Medicare-certified facilities operating between 2014 and 2017. RESULTS: Among dialysis facilities, the mean percentage of patients vaccinated during the influenza season was 72.1%. Facilities with higher proportions of Black and Hispanic patients had significantly lower vaccination percentages than less diverse facilities. The average proportion of patients vaccinated at each facility decreased significantly from 2014 to 2017 (a decrease of 1.05% vaccinated per year) and decreased significantly more so among facilities with higher minority proportions. The share of vaccinated patients in facilities in the quartile with the highest proportion of Black patients decreased 1.21% per year compared with a decrease of 0.88% per year in facilities in the quartile with the lowest proportion of Black patients. We found similar trends for Hispanic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of seasonal influenza vaccination are modestly but significantly lower among dialysis facilities with larger proportions of minority patients, and the gap seems to be widening over time. As wide-scale vaccination efforts grow more urgent amid the current COVID-19 pandemic, these disparities must be addressed to protect patients and communities equitably.","Danziger, John; Weinhandl, Eric; Friedman, David; Mukamal, Kenneth J",J Am Soc Nephrol,407,5

A healthy pregnancy can have significant impacts on the life chances of children. The objective of this review was to understand the association between individual-level and household-level measures of socioeconomic status and adverse pregnancy outcomes. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Nine databases were searched (Medline, Embase, Scopus, ASSIA, CINAHL, PsycINFO, BNI, MIDRIS and Google Scholar) for articles published between 1999 and August 2019. Grey literature searches were also assessed. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies reporting associations between individual-level or household socioeconomic factors on pregnancy outcomes in the UK or Ireland. RESULTS: Among the 82 353 search results, 53 821 titles were identified and 35 unique studies met the eligibility criteria. Outcomes reported were neonatal, perinatal and maternal mortality, preterm birth, birth weight and mode of delivery. Pooled effect sizes were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. There were significantly increased odds of women from lower levels of occupation/social classes compared with the highest level having stillbirth (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.59, I2 98.62%), neonatal mortality (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.57, I2 97.09%), perinatal mortality (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.57, I2 98.69%), preterm birth (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.33 to 1.50, I2 70.97%) and low birth weight (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.61, I2 99.85%). Limitations relate to available data, unmeasured confounders and the small number of studies for some outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This review identified consistent evidence that lower occupational status, especially manual occupations and unemployment, were significantly associated with increased risk of multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes. Strategies to improve pregnancy outcomes should incorporate approaches that address wider determinants of health to provide women and families with the best chances of having a healthy pregnancy and baby and to decrease pregnancy-related health inequalities in the general population.

METHODS: A 66-year-old woman with Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) and a unilateral Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) transplant received COVID-19 mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 14 days post-transplant. Seven days later, she presented with symptoms and signs of endothelial graft rejection. An 83-year-old woman with bilateral DMEK transplants for FECD 3 and 6 years earlier developed simultaneous acute endothelial rejection in both eyes, 3 weeks post second dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine BNT162b2. Rejection in both cases was treated successfully with topical corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: We believe this is the first report of temporal association between corneal transplant rejection following immunisation against COVID-19 and the first report of DMEK rejection following any immunisation. We hypothesise that the allogeneic response may have been initiated by the host antibody response following vaccination. Clinicians and patients should be aware of the potential of corneal graft rejection associated with vaccine administration and may wish to consider vaccination in advance of planned non-urgent keratoplasties. Patients should be counselled on the symptoms and signs that require urgent review to allow early treatment of any confirmed rejection episode.","Phylactou, Maria; Li, Ji-Peng Olivia; Larkin, Daniel F P",Br J Ophthalmol,407,1

Individuals with stimulant use disorder are a vulnerable population, who are particularly at risk of negative outcomes during this pandemic due to several risk factors, including mental and physical comorbidities, weakened immune responses, high-risk behaviors, and barriers to healthcare access. Engaging patients with stimulant use disorder in regular treatment has become even more difficult during this pandemic, which has resulted in many cuts to addiction treatment programs. The most effective treatment options for stimulant use disorder are psychosocial interventions, which rely heavily on in-person interactions, posing an added challenge during physical distancing. In particular, contingency management (CM) is a behavioral therapy that utilizes tangible reinforcements to incentivize targeted behavior changes, and is an effective treatment intervention used for stimulant use disorder. This paper highlights the treatment challenges for individuals with stimulant use disorder and the importance of adapting CM programs during COVID-19. We present strategies for how CM can be adapted and its role expanded in a safe way during the COVID-19 pandemic to help prevent infection spread, stimulant use relapse, and worsened psychosocial consequences.","Zastepa, Evelyn; Sun, Jane C; Clune, Jennifer; Mathew, Nickie",J Subst Abuse Treat,407,12

Recent recommendations highlight the important role of remote monitoring to prevent exposure to the virus. This study compared remote monitoring of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) in patients whose in-person annual visit was substituted for a remote monitoring session with patients who were already scheduled for a remote monitoring session. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional observational study of 329 consecutive patients between 20 March and 24 April 2020. Group 1 included 131 patients whose in-person annual visit was substituted for a remote monitoring session. Group 2 included 198 patients who underwent a remote monitoring session as scheduled in their usual device follow-up. The time interval since the last in-person visit was 13.3 ± 3.2 months in group 1 and 5.9 ± 1.7 months in group 2 (P < .01). RESULTS: In group 1, 15 patients (11.5%) experienced a clinical event compared to 15 patients (7.6%) in group 2 (P = .25). Nineteen patients (14.5%) required a physician intervention in group 1 compared to 19 patients (9.6%) in group 2 (P = .22). Two patients (1.5%) in group 1 and four patients (2.0%) in group 2 required an early in-person follow-up visit during the pandemic (P > .99). CONCLUSION: Remote monitoring of ICDs is useful to identify clinical events and allows physicians to treat patients appropriately during the COVID-19 pandemic regardless of the time interval since their last in-person visit.

BACKGROUND: After orthotopic HTx, allografts undergo DMI that contributes to functional impairment, especially to increased passive myocardial stiffness, which is an important pathophysiological determinant of left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction. Echocardiographic SW elastography is an emerging approach for measuring myocardial stiffness in vivo. Natural SWs occur after mechanical excitation of the myocardium, for example, after MVC, and their propagation velocity is directly related to myocardial stiffness, thus providing an opportunity to assess myocardial stiffness at end-diastole. METHODS: 52 HTx recipients that underwent right heart catheterization (all) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) (n = 23) during their annual check-up were prospectively enrolled. Echocardiographic SW elastography was performed in parasternal long axis views of the LV using an experimental scanner at 1,135 ± 270 frames per second. The degree of DMI was quantified with T1 mapping. RESULTS: SW velocity at MVC correlated best with native myocardial T1 values (r = 0.75; p < 0.0001) and was the best noninvasive parameter that correlated with pulmonary capillary wedge pressures (PCWP) (r = 0.54; p < 0.001). Standard echocardiographic parameters of LV diastolic function correlated poorly with both native T1 and PCWP values. CONCLUSIONS: End-diastolic SW propagation velocities, as measure of myocardial stiffness, showed a good correlation with CMR-defined diffuse myocardial injury and with invasively determined LV filling pressures in patients with HTx.

These VOC have rapidly spread through multiple geographies being enabled by high transmission rates and/or high viral load compared to the original parent strain. Consequently, the altered phenotypes of these VOC have posed greater challenges to diagnostic and clinical management of COVID-19. Despite considerable progress being made on vaccine roll out, practicing proper hand hygiene has been advocated as a consistent precautionary intervention as more virulent VOC continue to emerge and spread across geographies. Two variants of concern, namely beta and delta, have recently been shown to escape antibody-mediated neutralization by virtue of acquired mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein which binds to the human ACE2 receptor for cellular entry. In this report we have empirically determined the efficacy of a range of personal care formulations in inactivating the beta and delta variants of SARS-CoV-2. High titres of these variants were exposed to marketed personal care formulations from Unilever under standard in-vitro suspension test-based conditions relevant to end-user habits. All the formulations demonstrated greater than 99.9% reduction in viral infective titres. The rate of inactivation by these products were comparable to that of the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 virus tested under the same conditions. Therefore, it can be concluded that well-designed personal care formulations when tested under consumer-centric conditions, and with proven efficacy against the parent strain of SARS-CoV-2 will continue to be effective against extant and emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. This is through their broad-spectrum mode of action (disruption of lipid bilayer of the host-derived viral envelope, denaturation of envelop and nucleocapsid proteins, and disruption of genome) which is independent of the escape mutations that facilitate immune evasion or enhanced transmissibility.","Mukherjee, Sayandip; Vincent, Carol K.; Jayasekera, Harshinie W.; Yekhe, Ashish Shrikant",,407,1

The secondary objective was to assess reliability and safety for patient and caregivers, with a risk of iatrogenic viral contamination. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A single-center retrospective study was conducted between March 25 and April 25, 2020, in 47 COVID-19 patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. The inclusion criterion was having undergone percutaneous tracheostomy. RESULTS: Eighteen consecutively included patients had successfully undergone percutaneous tracheostomy despite unfavorable anatomical conditions (short neck: 83.3%, overweight or obese: 88.9%). Median time to completion was 11 days after intubation, with an average duration of 7minutes. The procedure was technically compliant in 83.3% of cases, and considered easy (on self-assessment) in 72.2%, with 2 minor per-procedural complications. No crossover to surgery was required. There was only 1 major post-procedural complication (late hemorrhage). CONCLUSION: This study showed the feasibility of percutaneous tracheostomy by an ENT physician under COVID-19 biohazard conditions.

The adaptive immune response that coincides with this onset of protection could represent the necessary elements of immunity against Covid-19. Methods: Serological and T cell analysis was performed in a cohort of 20 healthcare workers after receiving the first dose of Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine. The primary endpoint was the adaptive immune responses detectable at Days 7 and 10 after dosing. Results: Spike-specific T cells and binding antibodies were detectable 10 days after the first dose of vaccine, in contrast to receptor-blocking and SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies which were mostly undetectable at this early time-point.

METHOD: A retrospective cohort study took place, and data from 740 subjects, from all 32 states of Mexico, were analyzed. The association between the studied factors and severe (dyspnea requiring hospital admission) COVID-19 was evaluated through risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Severe illness was documented in 28% of participants. In multiple analysis, male gender (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.06-1.20), advanced age ([reference: 15-29 years old] 30-44, RR = 1.02, 95% CI 0.94-1.11; 45-59, RR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.15-1.38; 60 years or older, RR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.29-1.60), chronic kidney disease (RR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.04-1.64) and thoracic pain (RR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.10-1.24) were associated with an increased risk of severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating predictors of COVID-19 severity in a large subset of the Latin-American population.

One result could be a general reduction in routine vaccination activities. In Tuscany (Central Italy), paediatricians (in agreement with the regional health service) administer and register paediatric vaccinations of their patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on paediatric vaccinations administered by Tuscan paediatricians, as a proxy of adherence to vaccinations during this epidemic period. Methods: Four hundred members of the Tuscany section of the Italian Federation of Paediatricians (FIMP) were invited to participate in a semi-structured online survey. Results: During the COVID-19 pandemic, almost all (98.2%) of the 223 respondents reported a general decline in outpatient paediatric visits; 65.8% reported a more than 60% reduction (144 answers) in comparison with the situation before the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 208 paediatricians (93.3%) continued to vaccinate in the period considered: 66/208 (31.7%) reported a reduction in parents' compliance with mandatory vaccination (hexavalent and MMRV vaccines), and 88/208 (42.3%) reported a reduction in compliance with non-mandatory vaccinations. Almost all paediatricians declared having taken preventive actions to counter the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Discussion and conclusions: Although the majority of Tuscan paediatricians continued to vaccinate during the lock-down, some parents decided to postpone their children's scheduled vaccinations, mainly owing to fears concerning the safety of access to health services. When Italian immunization coverage data on the first months of 2020 become available, it will be possible to assess the real impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric vaccinations. It is crucial to continue vaccinating against preventable infectious diseases in order to avoid other possible epidemic outbreaks. The pandemic must not be seen as an obstacle to compliance with the vaccination schedule, but rather as an excellent opportunity to underline the importance of all recommended vaccinations.","Bechini, A; Garamella, G; Giammarco, B; Zanella, B; Flori, V; Bonanni, P; Boccalini, S",J Prev Med Hyg,407,20

Retrospective seroprevalence surveys are often used to screen for unidentified previous infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, the rate of humoral response in HCWs affected by COVID-19 is not well-defined. AIMS: To assess the specific IgG humoral response in symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected HCWs and identify potential factors associated with humoral response. METHODS: We prospectively recruited 204 HCWs with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 humoral response. Serum-IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were analysed using two commercially available serological assays. A logistic regression was performed to identify independent factors associated with positive IgG serology test. RESULTS: Overall, the SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity rate was 77%. This seropositivity rate was higher in symptomatic than in asymptomatic COVID-19 infection (83% versus 57%; P < 0.001) and in older HCWs.. The seropositivity rate did not diminish with time. In logistic regression, only a history of COVID-19 symptoms and age were identified as independent factors associated with the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies are found significantly more frequently in symptomatic and in older HCWs. The fact that not all COVID-19 HCWs develop detectable IgG is vital for the interpretation of COVID-19 seroprevalence surveys.","Cordova, E; Bacelar, B; Nieto, F; Garibaldi, F; Aguirre, V; Machuca, M; Badia, M; Rodriguez, C",Occup. med,407,24

In six patients (15%) a deep vein thrombosis and in 2 patients (5%) a thromboembolic event, were found; 12 patients (30%) had a catheter-related thrombosis. ROTEM analysis confirms that patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia had a hypercoagulation state that persisted over time.","Pavoni, Vittorio; Gianesello, Lara; Pazzi, Maddalena; Stera, Caterina; Meconi, Tommaso; Frigieri, Francesca Covani",J Thromb Thrombolysis,407,33

The SPICE-R authors, however, suggested for additional items for subscales ""roles and responsibilities for collaborative care"" and ""patient outcomes from collaborative practice"". We added two items and introduced SPICE-R3 to differentiate it from the 10-item SPICE-R2 and to adapt the scale to a wider range of healthcare members. We administered the SPICE-R3 to healthcare students at the height of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong in February 2020. Using data from 225 students from Chinese medicine, medicine, nursing, and pharmacy, confirmatory factor analysis indicated nine items having acceptable item coefficients. Our data obtained a good fit to the three-factor, nine-item model suggesting construct validity. Results of the between-network analysis suggest that the three subscales of SPICE-R3 correlated systematically with other theoretically relevant variables in the nomological network suggesting convergent validity. The SPICE-R3 is a valid measure to examine Hong Kong healthcare students' interprofessional attitudes in online interprofessional education even during the pandemic.

Potential SARS-CoV-2 MHC-I peptides are identified using a consensus MHC-I binding and presentation prediction algorithm, called EnsembleMHC. Starting with nearly 3.5 million candidates, we resolve a few hundred highly probable MHC-I peptides. By weighing individual MHC allele-specific SARS-CoV-2 binding capacity with population frequency in 23 countries, we discover a strong inverse correlation between predicted population SARS-CoV-2 peptide binding capacity and mortality rate.

However, despite the long history of visiting restrictions in health care systems, little is known about their effects. OBJECTIVES: This review sought to explore the consequences of visitor restrictions in health care services during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A systematic, integrative review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, based on a systematic search in PubMed, CHINAL full plus, Web of Science, PsychInfo, Scopus and the Cochrane Library. RESULTS: A total of 17 scientific papers covering intensive care, pediatric care, general medical care, hospital care, palliative care and nursing home settings were included. Although appreciation for the technical solutions enabling remote meetings was reported, visiting restrictions had several consequences, mainly negative, for the patient's health, the health and wellbeing of family members and the provision of care. Among physical health consequences, reduced nutrition intake, decreased activities of daily living and increased physical pain and symptoms were reported. Among mental health consequences for the patient, loneliness, depressive symptoms, agitation, aggression, reduced cognitive ability and overall dissatisfaction were observed. For family members, worry, anxiety and uncertainty occurred, and they reported an increased need for information from care providers. Family members of neonatal intensive care unit patients reported less bonding with their child and family relation disturbances due to the restrictions. For care providers, visiting restrictions added the burdens of ethical dilemmas, learning new technical means to enable social interaction and an increased demand for communication with families and providing social support to both family members and patients. CONCLUSIONS: When implementing visiting restrictions in health care services, decision makers and nurses need to be aware of their potential negative effects and adapt the provision of care to compensate for such effects. Nurses in all sectors should be aware that visiting restrictions may affect patients, families, and health care services for longer than the actual pandemic. Since the level of evidence regarding effect from visiting restrictions is low, further studies is strongly needed.","Hugelius, Karin; Harada, Nahoko; Marutani, Miki",Int J Nurs Stud,407,16

Currently, there is limited research that focuses on the mechanisms of change within complex telepsychology platforms, a factor that makes designing and implementing outcome measures challenging. OBJECTIVE: This project aims to articulate a theory of change (ToC) for Kooth, a web-based therapy and support platform for CYP. METHODS: A collaborative qualitative research design involving professional staff, academic partners, and young people was used to develop the ToC. The following three major reflective phases were engaged: a scoping workshop involving professional staff and academic partners, a series of explorative projects were completed to inform the development of the ToC, and the draft ToC was reviewed for coherence by key stakeholders (young people, online professionals, and service managers). RESULTS: A collaboratively developed ToC was presented. This was divided into the conditions that lead to individuals wanting to access web-based therapy and support (eg, individuals wanting support there and then or quickly), the mode of service delivery (eg, skilled and experienced professionals able to build empathetic relationships with CYP), and the observed and reported changes that occur as a consequence of using the service (eg, individuals being better able to manage current and future situations). CONCLUSIONS: Developing the ToC helps to shed light on how web-based therapy and support services aid the mental health and well-being of CYP. Furthermore, it helps to understand the development of positive virtual ecosystems and can be used to devise evaluative tools for CYP telepsychology providers.","Hanley, Terry; Sefi, Aaron; Grauberg, Janet; Prescott, Julie; Etchebarne, Andre",JMIR Pediatr Parent,407,15

Using the life cycle assessment method, we found that DPT for per person per meal emitted 597 g of CO2 and was far more than that of reusable plastic tableware (RPT, 7.00 g), ceramic tableware (9.55 g) and straw tableware (14.6 g). If the demand growth for DPT continues, 416 MT of CO2 will be emitted due to DPT consumption by 2050 globally. We further explored strategies to reduce CO2 emissions by examining the life cycles of four types of tableware according to sensitivity analysis. According to our results, if the recycling rate of DPT reaches 60% at the end-of-life stage, 50% of CO2 emissions can be cut; if dishwashing instead of hand washing is used to clean RPT, ceramic, and straw tableware, approximately 64%, 71%, and 23% of CO2 emissions can be reduced, respectively. If 60% of DPT is replaced by RPT, this plastic tableware will halve carbon emissions. If the rate reaches 100%, carbon emissions will be reduced by 92%. Although the CO2 emissions of the three types of tableware other than DPT are relatively small, RPT will bring other environmental burdens and human health risks, ceramic tableware is bulky and its additives are toxic. Straw tableware combines practical and safety performance. The results show that the choice of straw tableware plays a significant role in curbing the greenhouse effect without compromising consumer safety.","Sun, Qing; Yi, A-Lan; Ni, Hong-Gang",Sci Total Environ,407,24

However, whether optimistic bias could vary across age and culture is unknown. The present study aims to investigate: 1) whether individuals exhibit optimistic bias in the context of COVID-19 pandemic; 2) and whether age and culture would moderate such bias. METHOD: 1051 participants recruited from China, Israel and the US took the online survey. Risk perceptions consists of three questions: estimating the infected probability of different social distance groups (i.e., self, close others, and non-close others), the days that it would take for the number of new infections to decrease to zero and the trend of infections in regions of different geographical distances (i.e., local place, other places inside participants' country and other countries). Participants in China and the US also reported their personal communal values measured by Schwartz's Value Survey. RESULTS: Results from HLM generally confirmed that 1) all participants exhibited optimistic bias to some extent, and 2) with age, Chinese participants had a higher level of optimistic bias than Israeli and US participants. Compared to their younger counterparts, older Chinese are more likely to believe that local communities are at lower risk of COVID-19 than other countries. DISCUSSION: These findings support the hypothesis that age differences in risk perceptions might be influenced by cultural context. Further analysis indicated that such cultural and age variations in optimistic bias were likely to be driven by age-related increase in internalized cultural values.","Lin, Hongmei; Chang, Yuanqing; Chen, Chao; Ho, Yuen Wan; Xi, Wanyu; Zhang, Xin; Fung, Helene H; Ayalon, Liat",,407,26

In this study we set out to standardize the sampling times and sampling technique to minimize the risk of false negative results. DESIGN: A prospective observational study. METHOD: Thirty-nine consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to a regional hospital in Hong Kong underwent 2 serial conjunctival swabs for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis (1 on admission and another before discharge). Using clear instructional video, standardized technique for conjunctival sampling was adopted. Patient's medical history, ocular symptoms, nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 results and personal hygiene habits were prospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The majority had mild to moderate COVID-19 disease (89.74% of study participants); 15.38% reported symptoms suggestive of ocular surface inflammation, including epiphora (10.25%), itchiness (7.69%), and foreign body sensation (5.13%).

We aimed at pinpointing different observed ECG findings and discussing their clinical significance. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases. We included eligible original papers, reports, letters to the editors, and case reports published from December 2019 to May 10, 2020. RESULTS: The team identified 20 articles related to this topic. We divided them into articles discussing drug-induced and non-drug-induced changes. Studies reported an increased risk of QTc interval prolongations influenced by different therapies based on chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin. Although these medications increased risks of severe QTc prolongations, they induced no arrhythmia-related deaths. In the non-drug-induced group, ST-T abnormalities, notably ST elevation, accounted for the most observed ECG finding in the patients with COVID-19, but their relation with myocardial injuries was under dispute. CONCLUSION: This systematic review suggests that identifying ECG patterns that might be related to COVID-19 is vital. Provided that physicians do not recognize these patterns, they might erroneously risk the lives of their patients. Furthermore, important drug-induced ECG changes provide awareness to the health-care workers on the risks of possible therapies.","Mehraeen, Esmaeil; Seyed Alinaghi, Seyed Ahmad; Nowroozi, Ali; Dadras, Omid; Alilou, Sanam; Shobeiri, Parnian; Behnezhad, Farzane; Karimi, Amirali",Indian Heart J,407,9

Borders, world-making, and fear of others",15.972652,4.1935916,2021,"OBJECTIVE: VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) plays a critical role in physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Endothelial 3D podosomes (3DPs) are a type of F-actin-rich membrane microdomain, predominantly found in endothelial tip cells controlled by VEGF signaling during sprouting angiogenesis, such as occurs in retinal vasculature development. The molecular mechanisms governing 3DP formation have not been completely elucidated. Approach and Results: By using in vitro cell models and in vivo mouse models, we study the role of TM (thrombomodulin) in VEGF-induced endothelial 3DPs. Here, we report that VEGF can induce the expression of TM via ROCK2 (Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 2). Furthermore, ROCK2 can catalyze the phosphorylated activation of ezrin to promote the association of the cytoplasmic domain of TM with F-actin in 3DPs and thereby promote the formation of 3DPs. We used endothelial cells transfected with different TM mutants as models to verify the role of TM domains in 3DPs and angiogenic activity. TM expression in endothelial cells augments angiogenic activity, a response that is dependent on the interaction of the cytoplasmic tail of TM with ezrin, and the integrity of the lectin-like domain of TM. Thus, as compared with wild-type counterparts, mice lacking the lectin-like domain of TM exhibit reduced neovascularization of granulation tissues during cutaneous wound healing and less retinal neovascularization in a model of oxygen-induced retinopathy. CONCLUSIONS: VEGF-ROCK2-ezrin-TM-F-actin axis promotes the formation of the lipid raft membrane-associated complex configuration, 3DP, which plays a critical role in mediating tube formation and cell migration of endothelial cells in sprouting angiogenesis.","Kuo, Cheng-Hsiang; Huang, Yi-Hsun; Chen, Po-Ku; Lee, Gang-Hui; Tang, Ming-Jer; Conway, Edward M; Shi, Guey-Yueh; Wu, Hua-Lin",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,407,21

Motion trajectories are estimated using an iterative optimization algorithm (CMA-ES) and used to interpolate a 4D spatiotemporal motion vector field. The motion-compensated image is reconstructed using a modified filtered backprojection approach. Being image-based, the method does not require additional input besides the raw CBCT projection data and system geometry that are used for image reconstruction. Experimental studies investigated: (1) various autofocus objective functions, analyzed using a digital phantom with a range of sinusoidal motion magnitude (4, 8, 12, 16, 20 mm); (2) spatiotemporal regularization, studied using a CT dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive with deformable sinusoidal motion of variable magnitude (10, 15, 20, 25 mm); and (3) performance in complex anatomy, evaluated in cadavers undergoing simple and complex motion imaged on a CBCT-capable mobile C-arm system (Cios Spin 3D, Siemens Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany). Gradient entropy was found to be the best autofocus objective for soft-tissue CBCT, increasing structural similarity (SSIM) by 42%-92% over the range of motion magnitudes investigated. The optimal temporal regularization strength was found to vary widely (0.5-5 mm-2) over the range of motion magnitudes investigated, whereas optimal spatial regularization strength was relatively constant (0.1). In cadaver studies, deformable motion compensation was shown to improve local SSIM by â¼17% for simple motion and â¼21% for complex motion and provided strong visual improvement of motion artifacts (reduction of blurring and streaks and improved visibility of soft-tissue edges). The studies demonstrate the robustness of deformable motion compensation to a range of motion magnitudes, frequencies, and other factors (e.g. truncation and scatter).","Capostagno, S; Sisniega, A; Stayman, J W; Ehtiati, T; Weiss, C R; Siewerdsen, J H",Phys Med Biol,407,14

The components of weather include minimum temperature (°C), maximum temperature (°C), temperature average (°C), normal temperature (°C), precipitation level (mm) and wind speed (m/s). Since normality was not fulfilled, a non-parametric correlation test was used for data analysis. Maximum temperature (r = 0.347; p = .005), normal temperature(r = 0.293; p = .019), and precipitation level (r = -0.285; p = .022) were significantly correlated with covid-19 pandemic.

More robust immune activation in women has been proposed to contribute to decreased disease severity, although systemic inflammation has been associated with worse outcomes in COVID-19 infection. Whether systemic inflammation contributes to sex differences in COVID-19 infection is not known. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined sex differences in inflammatory markers among 453 men (mean age 61) and 328 women (mean age 62) hospitalized with COVID-19 infection at the Massachusetts General Hospital from March 8 to April 27, 2020. Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine the association of sex with initial and peak inflammatory markers. Exploratory analyses examined the association of sex and inflammatory markers with 28-day clinical outcomes using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Initial and peak CRP were higher in men compared with women after adjustment for baseline differences (initial CRP: ß 0.29, SE 0.07, p = 0.0001; peak CRP: ß 0.31, SE 0.07, p<0.0001) with similar findings for IL-6, PCT, and ferritin (p<0.05 for all). Men had greater than 1.5-greater odds of dying compared with women (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.04-2.80, p = 0.03). Sex modified the association of peak CRP with both death and ICU admission, with stronger associations observed in men compared with women (death: OR 9.19, 95% CI 4.29-19.7, p <0.0001 in men vs OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.52-5.18, p = 0.009 in women, Pinteraction = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of 781 men and women hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, men exhibited more robust inflammatory activation as evidenced by higher initial and peak inflammatory markers, as well as worse clinical outcomes. Better understanding of sex differences in immune responses to COVID-19 infection may shed light on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection.","Lau, Emily S; McNeill, Jenna N; Paniagua, Samantha M; Liu, Elizabeth E; Wang, Jessica K; Bassett, Ingrid V; Selvaggi, Caitlin A; Lubitz, Steven A; Foulkes, Andrea S; Ho, Jennifer E",PLoS One,407,30

Little is known about long-term consequences of COVID-19 on health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) and functional status in older people, and the impact of age in this context. We aimed to study age-related change in health-related quality of life, functional decline and mortality among older patients 6 months following hospitalisation due to COVID-19. METHODS: This was a cohort study including patients aged 60 years and older admitted to four general hospitals in South-Eastern Norway due to COVID-19, from March 1 up until July 1, 2020. Patients who were still alive were invited to attend a six-month follow-up. Change in HR-QoL and functional status compared to before the COVID-19 hospitalisation were assessed using the EuroQol 5-dimensional-5 levels questionnaire (EQ. 5D-5L). A change in visual analogue scale (VAS) score of 7 or more was considered clinically relevant. RESULTS: Out of 216 patients aged 60 years and older that were admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 during the study period, 171 were still alive 180 days after hospital admission, and 106 patients (62%) attended the six-month follow-up. Mean age was 74.3 years, 27 patients (26%) had experienced severe COVID-19. Fifty-seven participants (54%) reported a decrease in the EQ. 5D-5L VAS score after 6 months, with no significant difference between persons aged 75 years and older compared to younger. Seventy participants (66%) reported a negative change in any of the dimensions of the EQ. 5D-5L, with impaired ability to perform activities of daily life (35%), reduced mobility (33%) and having more pain or discomfort (33%) being the most commonly reported changes. Forty-six participants (43%) reported a negative change in cognitive function compared to before the COVID-19 hospitalisation. Six-month mortality was 21%, and increased with increasing age. CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the patients reported a negative change in HR-QoL 6 months following hospitalisation due to COVID-19, and one out of three experienced a persistently impaired mobility and ability to carry out activities of daily living. The results suggest awareness of long-term functional decline in older COVID-19 patients.","Walle-Hansen, M M; Ranhoff, A H; Mellingsæter, M; Wang-Hansen, M S; Myrstad, M",BMC Geriatr,407,26

METHODS: We describe the 18F-FDG PET/CT results from four patients who were admitted to the hospital with respiratory symptoms and fever between January 13 and January 20, 2020, when the COVID-19 outbreak was still unrecognized and the virus infectivity was unknown. A retrospective review of the patients' medical history, clinical and laboratory data, as well as imaging findings strongly suggested a diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: All patients had peripheral ground-glass opacities and/or lung consolidations in more than two pulmonary lobes. Lung lesions were characterized by a high 18F-FDG uptake and there was evidence of lymph node involvement. Conversely, disseminated disease was absent, a finding suggesting that COVID-19 has pulmonary tropism. CONCLUSIONS: Although 18F-FDG PET/CT cannot be routinely used in an emergency setting and is generally not recommended for infectious diseases, our pilot data shed light on the potential clinical utility of this imaging technique in the differential diagnosis of complex cases.","Qin, Chunxia; Liu, Fang; Yen, Tzu-Chen; Lan, Xiaoli",Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,407,16

Contact investigation and management were conducted to identify potential cases. Epidemiological investigation was carried out to determine the epidemiological and demographic characteristics of the outbreak. We estimated the secondary attack rate (SAR), incubation time and time-dependent reproductive number (Rt ) and explored the predisposing factors for cluster infection. The incubation time was 5.4 days and the serial interval (SI) was 4.4 days, with the rate of negative-valued SIs at 24.5%. The SAR at the bathing pool (3.3%) was relatively low due to its high temperature and humidity. The SAR was higher in the colleagues' cluster (20.5%) than in the family cluster (11.8%). Super-spreaders had a longer isolation delay time (p = .004). The Rt of the cluster decreased from the highest value of 3.88 on January 27, 2020 to 1.22 on February 6. Our findings suggest that the predisposing factors of the outbreak included close contact with an infected person, airtight and crowded spaces, temperature and humidity in the space and untimely isolation of patients and quarantine of contacts at the early stage of transmission. Measures to reduce the risk of infection at these gatherings and subsequent tracking of close contacts were effective.","Bao, Changjun; Pan, Enchun; Ai, Jing; Dai, Qigang; Xu, Ke; Shi, Naiyang; Gao, Qiang; Hu, Jianli; Peng, Zhihang; Huang, Haodi; Jin, Hui; Zhu, Fengcai",Transbound. emerg. dis.

Meanwhile, through responsive, strict, and strategic policy, some Asia countries pushed the elimination case by doing lockdown. This paper questioned how government respond this pandemic, tried to track down the unresponsive and slow decisions, and analyze them comprehensively trough policy system framework. Moreover, we also considered a few feasible and strategic recommendations to accelerate the pandemic responding. Methods: To visualize the anatomy of problems in handling these pandemic responses, this work applied Easton's black box analysis in formulating and introducing public policy. The black box analysis would help us to portray and understood the interests, rationalities, and priorities behind introducing public policies which was implemented to handle this health problem. Besides, the policy triangle framework was used to analyze how environment influenced key actor in making decision. Results: This analysis study discovered the conflict interests in formulating and implementing public policy in handling COVID-19. The public policies are negotiated, discussed, and formulated under black box that ignore transparency, and other good governance principles. Consequently, the substance of public policy represents a certain interest of policy makers, that may conflict with the others and often contradict to the constitutional-based public interests, that is public health. It was impacted the emergence of messy and uncoordinated institutions that implement the conflicted policies. Undeniably, this situation may spark counter-productive ways, attitudes, and actions of people in responding those ambiguous policies. Therefore, this work recommended revising the coherences norms and public policies; reforming the ministry of health in public health's paradigm context; and improving the integration and coordination of cross related institutions, creating a single data on public health, and changing a new paradigm of people, including improving collective awareness in responding and handling COVID-19 appropriately.","Ayuningtyas, Dumilah; Haq, Hayyan Ul; Utami, Raden Roro Mega; Susilia, Sevina",Front Public Health,407,24

Moreover, patients with RM had laboratory test abnormalities, including the presence of markers of inflammation, activation of coagulation, and kidney injury. Patients with RM also had a higher risk of in-hospital death (Pâ<â0.001).

Overexpression of circ_0060745 caused an increase in infarct size and worsened cardiac functions after AMI. In summary, our findings showed that knockdown of circ_0060745 mitigates AMI by suppressing cardiomyocyte apoptosis and inflammation. These protective effects could be attributed to inhibition of NF-&#954;B activation.","Zhai, Changlin; Qian, Gang; Wu, Huajun; Pan, Haihua; Xie, Shuoyin; Sun, Zhewei; Shao, Pingyang; Tang, Guanmin; Hu, Huilin; Zhang, Song",J. cell. mol. med,407,16

METHODS: This study is a quasi-experiment study. The study population was patients who visited all 402 EDs in Korea between December 31, 2019 and May 13, 2020, using the National Emergency Department Information System (NEDIS) database. The study period was classified into 5 phases according to the level of national crisis warning of infectious disease and the implementation of emergency care-related health policies, and all study phases were 27 days. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcome was length of stay (LOS) in the ED during the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: The number of ED visits during the study period was 2,636,341, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 1.4%. The number of ED visits decreased from 803,160 in phase 1 to 496,619 in phase 5 during the study period. For in-hospital mortality, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval) was 0.77 (0.74-0.79) in phase 5 compared to phase 3. Additionally, by subgroup, the ORs were 0.69 (0.57-0.83) for the patients with acute myocardial infarction and 0.76 (0.67-0.87) for severe trauma in phase 5 compared to phase 3. The ED LOS increased while the number of ED visits decreased as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, and the ED LOS declined after policy implementation (beta coefficient: -5.3 [-6.5 to -4.2] minutes in phase 5 compared to phase 3). CONCLUSION: Implementing appropriate emergency care policies in the COVID-19 pandemic would have contributed to improving the safety of all emergency patients and reducing in-hospital mortality by preventing excessive deaths.","Pak, Yun Suk; Ro, Young Sun; Kim, Se Hyung; Han, So Hyun; Ko, Sung Keun; Kim, Taehui; Kwak, Young Ho; Heo, Tag; Moon, Sungwoo",J Korean Med Sci,407,1

One way to improve rates of institutional deliveries is through improving institutional delivery service satisfaction in women. The aim of this research is to identify which factors influence delivery service satisfaction during the period of COVID-19 and which socio-demographic characteristics of women are associated with greater fear of catching COVID-19 during institutional deliveries. METHODS: A total of 190 women who had given birth between May to June, 2020, were sampled from two private and two public sector hospitals in Lahore, Pakistan. A standardized tool was modified for use and a combination of descriptive statistics and multivariate regression was applied. RESULTS: The results reveal that a majority of women, at 74.7%, are afraid of contracting COVID-19; specifically, women delivering at public hospitals, those who are illiterate or semi-literate, with more than four children, with low household income, and who are unemployed. Regression models are used to identify factors related to higher satisfaction, including the following: (i) pre-delivery care (explanatory power of R2 = 0.651); (ii) during delivery care (R2 = 0.716); (iii) after delivery care for women (R2 = 0.525); and (iv) after delivery care for newborn (R2 = 0.780). The main areas which influence satisfaction include the following: service quality of staff and administration; maintenance of hygiene and sanitation; involvement in decision-making; provision of necessary information; and advice for breastfeeding, immunization and family planning. CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: Based on our findings, we recommend improved regulation of delivery services in both public and private hospitals and increased protection for disadvantaged women groups to maintain service quality during the pandemic.","Jafree, Sara Rizvi; Momina, Ainul; Muazzam, Amina; Wajid, Rabia; Calib, Gloria",Matern Child Health J,407,16

The recent pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID­19) has seriously endangered the global health system. In particular, hospitals have had to deal with a frequency in the emergency room and a request for beds for infectious diseases never faced in the last decades. It is well-known that hospitals are environments with a high infectious risk. Environmental control of indoor air and surfaces becomes an important means of limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In particular, to preserve an adequate indoor microbiological quality, an important non-pharmacological strategy is represented by Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems and finishing materials. Starting from the SARS-CoV-2 transmission routes, the paper investigates the hospital risk analysis and management, the indoor air quality and determination of microbial load, surface management and strategies in cleaning activities, HVAC systems' management and filters' efficiency. In conclusion, the paper suggests some strategies of interventions and best practices to be taken into considerations for the next steps in design and management.","Gola, M; Caggiano, G; De Giglio, O; Napoli, C; Diella, G; Carlucci, M; Carpagnano, L F; D039,; Alessandro, D; Joppolo, C M; Capolongo, S; Montagna, M T",Ann. ig,407,16

Later, it was shown that reactive nitrogen species could also modify proteins. Some protein oxidative modifications promote loss of protein function, cleavage or aggregation, and some result in proteotoxicity and cellular homeostasis disruption. However, not all oxidative modifications are necessarily associated with damage, as with Met and Cys protein residue oxidation. In these cases, redox state changes can alter protein structure, catalytic function, signaling processes in response to metabolic and/or environmental alterations. This review aims to integrate the present knowledge on redox modifications of proteins with their fate and role in redox signaling and human pathological conditions. Critical issues: It is hypothesized that protein oxidation participates in the development and progression of many pathological conditions. However, no quantitative data has been correlated with specific oxidized proteins or the progression or severity of pathological conditions. Hence, the comprehension of the mechanisms underlying these modifications, their importance in human pathologies and, the fate of the modified proteins is of clinical relevance. Future directions: We discuss new tools to cope with protein oxidation and suggest new approaches for integrating knowledge about protein oxidation and redox processes with human pathophysiological conditions.","Demasi, Marilene; Augusto, Ohara; Bechara, Etelvino J H; Bicev, Ms. Renata N.; Cerqueira, Fernanda M; Cunha, Fernanda M da; Denicola, Ana; Gomes, Fernando; Miyamoto, Sayuri; Netto, Luis E.S.; Randall, Lia M; Stevani, Cassius V; Thomson, Leonor",Antioxid.

The current coronavirus crisis will have a strong and negative impact on the German economy, according to the current business cycle expectations of German firms. To the extent that the training decisions of firms depend on these perceptions, we expect a downward shift in firm demand for apprentices and consequently also a decrease in the equilibrium number of apprenticeship contracts. To assess the impact of changes in business cycle expectations, we analyze German data on the apprenticeship market at the state-level and at the occupation-level within states from 2007 to 2019. We apply first-differences regressions to account for unobserved heterogeneity across states and occupations, allowing us to identify the association between changes in two popular measures of business cycle expectations (the ifo Business Climate Index and the ifo Employment Barometer) and subsequent changes in the demand for apprentices, the number of new apprenticeship contracts, unfilled vacancies and unsuccessful applicants. We find that the German apprenticeship market prior to the current crisis can be characterized by excess demand for apprentices (although there are matching problems in some states, with both a high share of unfilled vacancies and a high share of unsuccessful applicants). Taking into account the most recent data on business cycle expectations up to June 2020, we estimate that the coronavirus-related decrease in firms’ expectations about the business cycle can be associated with a predicted 8% decrease in firm demand for apprentices and a 6% decrease in the number of new apprenticeship positions in Germany compared to 2019 (− 30,000 apprenticeship contracts; 95% confidence interval: ± 8000).","Muehlemann, Samuel; Pfeifer, Harald; Wittek, Bernhard H.",Empir.

In this work, we have applied quantum mechanical and classical atomistic molecular dynamics computational approaches to demonstrate the adsorption properties of HCQ on Ag, Au, AgAu, and Pt nanoparticles. The adsorption energies (less than -30 kcal/mole) were established for HCQ, and the (non)perturbative effects of this drug on the plasmonic absorption spectra of AgNP and AuNP have characterized with time-dependent density functional theory. The effect of size and compositions of nanoparticle on the coating with HCQ and CQ have obtained and proposed the appropriate candidate for drug delivery.

To attempt to improve outcome, several trials have assessed a variety of potential adjunctive therapeutics, however none to date has been shown to be beneficial. This may be due, at least partly, to the therapeutics chosen and clinical trial design used. Here, we highlight three themes that could facilitate the choice and evaluation of putative adjuvant interventions for severe malaria, paving the way for their assessment in randomized controlled trials. Most clinical trials of adjunctive therapeutics to date have been underpowered due to the large number of participants required to reach mortality endpoints, rendering these study designs challenging and expensive to conduct. These limitations may be mitigated by the use of risk-stratification of participants and application of surrogate endpoints. Appropriate surrogate endpoints include direct measures of pathways causally involved in the pathobiology of severe and fatal malaria, including markers of host immune and endothelial activation and microcirculatory dysfunction. We propose using circulating markers of these pathways to identify high-risk participants that would be most likely to benefit from adjunctive therapy, and further by adopting these biomarkers as surrogate endpoints; moreover, choosing interventions that target deleterious host immune responses that directly contribute to microcirculatory dysfunction, multi-organ dysfunction and death; and, finally, prioritizing where possible, drugs that act on these pathways that are already approved by the FDA, or other regulators, for other indications, and are known to be safe in target populations, including children. An emerging understanding of the critical role of the host response in severe malaria pathogenesis may facilitate both clinical trial design and the search of effective adjunctive therapeutics.","Varo, Rosauro; Erice, Clara; Johnson, Sydney; Bassat, Quique; Kain, Kevin C",Malar J,407,24

Actions are needed to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on mental health by protecting and promoting the psychological wellbeing of healthcare workers during and after the outbreak. We developed and evaluated a digital learning package using Agile methodology within the first three weeks of UK outbreak. This e-package includes evidence-based guidance, support and signposting relating to psychological wellbeing for all UK healthcare employees. A three-step rapid development process included public involvement activities (PPIs) (STEP 1), content and technical development with iterative peer review (STEP 2), and delivery and evaluation (STEP 3). The package outlines the actions that team leaders can take to provide psychologically safe spaces for staff, together with guidance on communication and reducing social stigma, peer and family support, signposting others through psychological first aid (PFA), self-care strategies (e.g., rest, work breaks, sleep, shift work, fatigue, healthy lifestyle behaviours), and managing emotions (e.g., moral injury, coping, guilt, grief, fear, anxiety, depression, preventing burnout and psychological trauma). The e-package includes advice from experts in mental wellbeing as well as those with direct pandemic experiences from the frontline, as well as signposting to public mental health guidance. Rapid delivery in STEP 3 was achieved via direct emails through professional networks and social media. Evaluation included assessment of fidelity and implementation qualities. Essential content was identified through PPIs (n = 97) and peer review (n = 10) in STEPS 1 and 2. The most important messages to convey were deemed to be normalisation of psychological responses during a crisis, and encouragement of self-care and help-seeking behaviour. Within 7 days of completion, the package had been accessed 17,633 times, and healthcare providers had confirmed immediate adoption within their health and wellbeing provisions. Evaluation (STEP 3, n = 55) indicated high user satisfaction with content, usability and utility. Assessment of implementation qualities indicated that the package was perceived to be usable, practical, low cost and low burden. Our digital support package on 'psychological wellbeing for healthcare workers' is free to use, has been positively evaluated and was highly accessed within one week of release. It is available here: Supplementary Materials. This package was deemed to be appropriate, meaningful and useful for the needs of UK healthcare workers. We recommend provision of this e-package to healthcare workers alongside wider strategies to support their psychological wellbeing during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Blake, Holly; Bermingham, Fiona; Johnson, Graham; Tabner, Andrew",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),407,1

METHODS: A telemedicine workflow was implemented as a quality improvement study using the Plan-Do-Study-Act method. All patients presenting with ureteric colic without high-risk features of fever, severe pain, and hydronephrosis, were recruited, and face-to-face appointments to review scan results were replaced with phone consultations. Data were prospectively collected over 3 years (January 2017 to December 2019). Patient outcomes including the reduction in face-to-face review visits, time to review, reattendance and intervention rates, were tracked in an interrupted time-series analysis, and qualitative feedback was obtained from patients and clinicians. RESULTS: Around 53.2% of patients presenting with ureteric colic were recruited into the telemedicine workflow. A total of 465 patients (46.2%) had normal scan results and 250 patients (24.9%) did not attend their scan appointments, hence reducing the number of face-to-face consultations by 71.1%. A total of 230 patients (22.9%) required subsequent follow-up with urology, while 61 patients (6.1%) were referred to other specialties. Mean (SD) time to review was 30.0 (6.2) days, 6-month intervention rate was 3.4% (n = 34) and unplanned reattendance rate was 3.2% (n = 32). Around 93.1% of patients reported satisfaction with the service. CONCLUSION: The ureteric colic telemedicine service successfully and sustainably reduced the number of face-to-face consultations and time to review without compromising on patient safety. The availability of this telemedicine service has become even more important in helping us provide care to patients with ureteric colic in the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Ong, Chloe Shu Hui; Lu, Jirong; Tan, Yi Quan; Tan, Lincoln Guan Lim; Tiong, Ho Yee",Urology,407,16

We sought to examine ICU census trends in relation to ICU bed capacity during the rapid increase in severe coronavirus disease 2019 cases early during the pandemic. Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: Thirteen geographically dispersed academic medical centers in the United States. Patients/Subjects: We obtained daily ICU censuses from March 26 to June 30, 2020, as well as prepandemic ICU bed capacities. The primary outcome was daily census of ICU patients stratified by coronavirus disease 2019 and mechanical ventilation status in relation to ICU capacity. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Prepandemic overall ICU capacity ranged from 62 to 225 beds (median 109). During the study period, the median daily coronavirus disease 2019 ICU census per hospital ranged from 1 to 84 patients, and the daily ICU census exceeded overall ICU capacity for at least 1 day at five institutions. The number of critically ill patients exceeded ICU capacity for a median (interquartile range) of 17 (12-50) of 97 days at these five sites. All 13 institutions experienced decreases in their noncoronavirus disease ICU population, whereas local coronavirus disease 2019 cases increased. Coronavirus disease 2019 patients reached their greatest proportion of ICU capacity on April 12, 2020, when they accounted for 44% of ICU patients across all participating hospitals. Maximum ICU census ranged from 52% to 289% of overall ICU capacity, with three sites less than 80%, four sites 80-100%, five sites 100-128%, and one site 289%. Conclusions: From March to June 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic led to ICU censuses greater than ICU bed capacity at fives of 13 institutions evaluated. These findings demonstrate the short-term adaptability of U.S. healthcare institutions in redirecting limited resources to accommodate a public health emergency.","Douin, David J; Ward, Michael J; Lindsell, Christopher J; Howell, Michelle P; Hough, Catherine L; Exline, Matthew C; Gong, Michelle N; Aboodi, Michael S; Tenforde, Mark W; Feldstein, Leora R; Stubblefield, William B; Steingrub, Jay S; Prekker, Matthew E; Brown, Samuel M; Peltan, Ithan D; Khan, Akram; Files, D Clark; Gibbs, Kevin W; Rice, Todd W; Casey, Jonathan D; Hager, David N; Qadir, Nida; Henning, Daniel J; Wilson, Jennifer G; Patel, Manish M; Self, Wesley H; Ginde, Adit A",Crit Care Explor,407,20

Understanding the roles of such 'superspreaders' can be crucial in deciding where to direct disease surveillance and controls to greatest effect. In the epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in Great Britain, it has been suggested that a minority of cattle farms or herds might make disproportionate contributions to the spread of Mycobacterium bovis, and hence might be considered 'superspreader farms'. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We review the literature to identify the characteristics of farms that have the potential to contribute to exceptional values in the three main components of the farm reproductive number - Rf : contact rate, infectiousness and duration of infectiousness, and therefore might characterize potential superspreader farms for bovine tuberculosis in Great Britain. RESULTS: Farms exhibit marked heterogeneity in contact rates arising from between-farm trading of cattle. A minority of farms act as trading hubs that greatly augment connections within cattle trading networks. Herd infectiousness might be increased by high within-herd transmission or the presence of supershedding individuals, or infectiousness might be prolonged due to undetected infections or by repeated local transmission, via wildlife or fomites. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting control methods on putative superspreader farms might yield disproportionate benefits in controlling endemic bovine tuberculosis in Great Britain. However, real-time identification of any such farms, and integration of controls with industry practices, present analytical, operational and policy challenges.","Fielding, Helen R; McKinley, Trevelyan J; Delahay, Richard J; Silk, Matthew J; McDonald, Robbie A",Vet. med. sci,407,9

It is therefore important to be aware of the key demographic and contextual risk factors for factitious hypoglycaemia, as well the investigations and management options available for suspected cases. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this article we describe a case report and literature review of factitious hypoglycaemia. The search was conducted using the PubMed database and identified 23 case reports of 31 patients aged 18 or over with insulin-induced factitious hypoglycaemia. RESULTS: The average age of these patients was 33.7 (±13.5) years, the female: male ratio was 4.3:1, 38% had medical occupations or past medical training, 53% had diabetes mellitus, and 41% had a positive psychiatric history. Misdiagnoses were common and often resulted in inappropriate treatment. Very few cases discussed psychiatric management. CONCLUSIONS: Factitious hypoglycaemia is more commonly reported in middle-aged females, in a medical profession, with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus and psychiatric illness. However, it may affect a variety of patients and the absence of these features should not discourage a diagnosis. C-peptide levels and insulin assays can help identify factitious hypoglycaemia over other causes of hypoglycaemia, and management should include a greater focus on psychiatric treatment.","Kyriacou, Harry; Duggleby, William; Hatoum, Adam; Khan, Tahir; Manley, George; Filippidou, Maria",Psychiatr Danub,407,3

While 'dilution of air by opening the window' has been prescribed by national and international health agencies, unintended detrimental consequences might result in many developing countries with high ambient air pollution. In the present study, PM2.5 exposure concentration and probability of mortality due to PM2.5 in different scenarios were assessed. A COVID airborne infection risk estimator was used to estimate the probability of infection by aerosol transmission in various commuter micro-environments: (a) air conditioned (AC) taxi (b) non-AC taxi (c) bus and (d) autorickshaw. The following were the estimated exposure concentrations in the four types of vehicles during pre-lockdown, during lockdown, and lost-lockdown: AC taxi cars (17.16 µg/m3, 4.52 µg/m3, and 25.09 µg/m3); non-AC taxis: (28.74 µg/m3, 7.56 µg/m3, 42.01 µg/m3); buses (21.79 µg/m3, 5.73 µg/m3, 31.86 µg/m3) autorickshaws (51.30 µg/m3, 3.50 µg/m3, 75 µg/m3). Post-lockdown, the probability of mortality due to PM2.5 was highest for autorickshaws (5.67 × 10-3), followed by non-AC taxis (2.07 × 10-3), buses (1.39 × 10-3), and AC taxis (1.02 × 10-3). This order of risk is inverted for the probability of infection by SARS-COV-2, with the highest for AC taxis (6.10 × 10-2), followed by non-AC taxis (1.71 × 10-2), buses (1.42 × 10-2), and the lowest risk in autorickshaws (1.99 × 10-4). The findings of the present study suggest that vehicles with higher ventilation or air changes per hour (ACH) should be preferred over other modes of transport during COVID-19 pandemic.","Das, Darpan; Ramachandran, Gurumurthy",Environ Res,407,16

Personal protective equipment (PPE) is the final line of protection of healthcare workers (HCW). There is variation as well as controversy of infection control recommendation with regards to the use of PPE for HCW between institutions. The aim of this narrative review is to of examine and summarise the available evidence to guide recommendation for the safety of HCW. METHOD: A literature search was conducted on the PubMed, MedLine and Embase databases with the keywords ""personal protective equipment,"" ""COVID 19,"" ""n95,"" ""health care worker"" and ""mortality."" RESULTS: SARS-nCoV-2 is highly contagious. About 3.5%-20% of HCW has been reported to be infected. The mortality ranges from 0.53% to 1.94%. PPE is part of the measure within a package of prevention and control of pandemic, rather than a replacement of. Respirators are more effective than masks in preventing aerosol transmission to HCWs. Extended use may be considered if guidelines are adhered. Powered air-purifying respirators if available should be used in high-risk procedures. CONCLUSION: Transmission of viruses is multimodal and in the setting of a novel pathogen with high case fatality with no proven effective interventions, PPE that affords the best protection should be available to HCWs.","Ha, Jennifer F",Int J Clin Pract,407,16

These exogenous sources of variation, or natural experiments, are sometimes proposed as instrumental variables to examine the effects of a given exposure(s) on a given outcome(s). Previous epidemiological studies have applied this technique using famines, earthquakes, weather events, and previous pandemics as exogenous sources of variation for other exposures; interest in applying this technique using the current severe acute respiratory system coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is already documented. Yet, large-scale events like these likely have broad and complicated impacts on human health, which almost certainly violates the exclusion restriction assumption of instrumental variable analyses. We review the assumptions of instrumental variable analyses, highlight previous applications of this method with respect to natural experiments with broad impacts or ""shocks"", and discuss how these relate to our current observations of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While we encourage thorough investigation of the broad impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on human health, we caution against its widespread use as an instrumental variable to study other exposures of interest.","Dimitris, Michelle C; Platt, Robert W",Am. j. epidemiol,407,24

One hundred and fifty-eight patients from two hospitals were enrolled to identify the indicators of severe COVID-19 and observe the natural course of COVID-19 patients without clinical intervention. The total computed tomography (CT) score, a quantitative score based on assessment of the number, quadrant, and area of the lesions in CT, tended to perform better than assessment based only on the number or area of the lesions (p = 0.0004 and p = 0.0887, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression showed that the total CT score, chest tightness, lymphocyte, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were independent factors for severe COVID-19. For patients admitted in 2 weeks from onset to hospitalization, the frequency of severe COVID-19 was gradually increased with the delayed hospitalization. The symptoms of fatigue, dry cough, sputum production, chest tightness, and polypnea were gradually more frequent. The levels of C-reactive protein, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase, LDH, and d-dimer were also gradually increased, as well as the scores based on CT. Conversely, the lymphocyte count and the albumin level were gradually decreased with the delayed hospitalization. Detail turning points of the above alterations were observed after 10-14 days from onset to hospitalization. Total CT score was a simple and feasible score for identifying severe COVID-19. COVID-19 patients without clinical intervention deteriorated gradually during the initial 10-14 days but gradually improved thereafter.","Wu, Daxian; Rao, Qunfang; Zhang, Wenfeng",J. med. virol,407,16

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is also a disease of immune dysregulation leading to multisystem compromise. We present a case of new-onset SLE concomitantly with COVID-19 and development of antiphospholipid antibodies. An 18-year-old female that presented with hemodynamic collapse and respiratory failure, progressed to cardiac arrest, and had a pericardial tamponade drained. She then progressed to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, severe ventricular dysfunction, and worsening renal function with proteinuria and hematuria. Further studies showed bilateral pleural effusions, positive antinuclear and antidouble-stranded DNA antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, and anticardiolipin B. C3 and C4 levels were low. SARS-Cov-2 PCR was positive after 2 negative tests. She also developed multiple deep venous thrombosis, in the setting of positive antiphospholipid antibodies and lupus anticoagulant. In terms of pathophysiology, COVID-19 is believed to cause a dysregulated cytokine response which could potentially be exacerbated by the shift in Th1 to Th2 response seen in SLE. Also, it is well documented that viral infections are an environmental factor that contributes to the development of autoimmunity; however, COVID-19 is a new entity, and it is not known if it could trigger autoimmune conditions. Additionally, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2, as it happens with other viruses, might lead to the formation of antiphospholipid antibodies, potentially contributing to the increased rates of thrombosis seen in COVID-19.","Mantovani Cardoso, Eduardo; Hundal, Jasmin; Feterman, Dominique; Magaldi, John",Clin Rheumatol,407,19

Firstly, MSCs were successfully isolated from human bone marrow (BM), but in the next steps, they were also extracted from other sources, mostly from the umbilical cord (UC) and adipose tissue (AT). The International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) has suggested minimum criteria to identify and characterize MSCs as follows: plastic adherence, surface expression of CD73, D90, CD105 in the lack of expression of CD14, CD34, CD45, and human leucocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR), and also the capability to differentiate to multiple cell types including adipocyte, chondrocyte, or osteoblast in vitro depends on culture conditions. However, these distinct properties, including self-renewability, multipotency, and easy accessibility are just one side of the coin; another side is their huge secretome which is comprised of hundreds of mediators, cytokines, and signaling molecules and can effectively modulate the inflammatory responses and control the infiltration process that finally leads to a regulated tissue repair/healing or regeneration process. MSC-mediated immunomodulation is a direct result of a harmonic synergy of MSC-released signaling molecules (i.e., mediators, cytokines, and chemokines), the reaction of immune cells and other target cells to those molecules, and also feedback in the MSC-molecule-target cell axis. These features make MSCs a respectable and eligible therapeutic candidate to be evaluated in immune-mediated disorders, such as graft versus host diseases (GVHD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Crohn's disease (CD), and osteoarthritis (OA), and even in immune-dysregulating infectious diseases such as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This paper discussed the therapeutic applications of MSC secretome and its biomedical aspects related to immune-mediated conditions. Sources for MSC extraction, their migration and homing properties, therapeutic molecules released by MSCs, and the pathways and molecular mechanisms possibly involved in the exceptional immunoregulatory competence of MSCs were discussed. Besides, the novel discoveries and recent findings on immunomodulatory plasticity of MSCs, clinical applications, and the methods required for their use as an effective therapeutic option in patients with immune-mediated/immune-dysregulating diseases were highlighted.","Markov, Alexander; Thangavelu, Lakshmi; Aravindhan, Surendar; Zekiy, Angelina Olegovna; Jarahian, Mostafa; Chartrand, Max Stanley; Pathak, Yashwant; Marofi, Faroogh; Shamlou, Somayeh; Hassanzadeh, Ali",Stem Cell Res Ther,407,20

However, systemic administration of higher dosages of doxorubicin is hampered by its toxic side effects. In this study, we aim to increase doxorubicin deposition in the primary breast tumour without changing systemic doxorubicin concentration and thus without interfering with systemic efficacy and toxicity. This is to be achieved by combining Lyso-Thermosensitive Liposomal Doxorubicin (LTLD, ThermoDox, Celsion Corporation, Lawrenceville, NJ, USA) with mild local hyperthermia, induced by Magnetic Resonance guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU). When heated above 39.5°C, LTLD releases a high concentration of doxorubicin intravascularly within seconds. In the absence of hyperthermia, LTLD leads to a similar biodistribution and antitumour efficacy compared with conventional doxorubicin. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a single-arm phase I study in 12 chemotherapy-naïve patients with de novo stage IV HER2-negative breast cancer. Previous endocrine treatment is allowed. Study treatment consists of up to six cycles of LTLD at 21-day intervals, administered during MR-HIFU-induced hyperthermia to the primary tumour. We will aim for 60 min of hyperthermia at 40°C-42°C using a dedicated MR-HIFU breast system (Profound Medical, Mississauga, Canada). Afterwards, intravenous cyclophosphamide will be administered. Primary endpoints are safety, tolerability and feasibility. The secondary endpoint is efficacy, assessed by radiological response.This approach could lead to optimal loco-regional control with less extensive or even no surgery, in de novo stage IV patients and in stage II/III patients allocated to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has obtained ethical approval by the Medical Research Ethics Committee Utrecht (Protocol NL67422.041.18, METC number 18-702).

This study aims to develop an agent based model that compares changes in infection progression by manipulating different parameters in a synthetic population. Model input includes population characteristics like age, sex, working status etc. of each individual and other factors influencing disease dynamics. Depending on number of epicentres of infection, location of primary cases, sensitivity, proportion of asymptomatic and frequency or duration of lockdown, our simulator tracks every individual and hence infection progression through community over time. In a closed community of 10000 people, it is seen that without any lockdown, number of cases peak around 6th week and wanes off around 15th week. If primary case is located inside dense population cluster like slums, cases peak early and wane off slowly. With introduction of lockdown, cases peak at slower rate. If sensitivity of identifying infection decreases, cases and deaths increase. Number of cases declines with increase in proportion of asymptomatic cases. The model is robust and provides reproducible estimates with realistic parameter values. It also guides in identifying measures to control outbreak in a community. It is flexible in accommodating different parameters like infectivity period, yield of testing, socio-economic strata, daily travel, awareness level, population density, social distancing, lockdown etc. and can be tailored to study other infections with similar transmission pattern.","Burman, Anik; Chatterjee, Sayak; Ghosh, Pramit; Mukhokadhyay, Indranil",,407,14

Studies indicate that south-west monsoon season plays a role in the dynamics of contagious diseases, which tend to peak post-monsoon season. Recent studies show that vitamin D and its primary source Ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation may play a protective role in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. However, the combined roles of the monsoon season and UVB radiation in COVID-19 in India remain still unclear. In this observational study, we empirically study the respective roles of monsoon season and UVB radiation, whilst further exploring, whether the monsoon season negatively impacts the protective role of UVB radiation in COVID-19 deaths in India. We use a log-linear Mundlak model to a panel dataset of 36 administrative regions in India from 14 March 2020-19 November 2020 (n = 6751). We use the cumulative COVID-19 deaths as the dependent variable. We isolate the association of monsoon season and UVB radiation as measured by Ultraviolet Index (UVI) from other confounding time-constant and time-varying region-specific factors. After controlling for various confounding factors, we observe that a unit increase in UVI and the monsoon season are separately associated with 1.2 percentage points and 7.5 percentage points decline in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths in the long run. These associations translate into substantial relative changes. For example, a permanent unit increase of UVI is associated with a decrease of growth rates of COVID-19 deaths by 33% (= - 1.2 percentage points) However, the monsoon season, mitigates the protective role of UVI by 77% (0.92 percentage points). Our results indicate a protective role of UVB radiation in mitigating COVID-19 deaths in India. Furthermore, we find evidence that the monsoon season is associated with a significant reduction in the protective role of UVB radiation. Our study outlines the roles of the monsoon season and UVB radiation in COVID-19 in India and supports health-related policy decision making in India.","Moozhipurath, Rahul Kalippurayil; Kraft, Lennart",Sci Rep,407,25

Perceptions about the time sensitivity and medical necessity of a procedure have taken on greater significance during the pandemic. The evolving ethical and clinical environment requires reappraisal of perioperative factors, such as personal protective equipment conservation; limiting the risk of exposure to COVID-19 for patients, families, and healthcare workers; preservation of hospital beds and ICU resources; and minimizing COVID-19-related perioperative risk to patients. STUDY DESIGN: A scaffold for the complex decision-making required for prioritization of medically necessary, time-sensitive (MeNTS) operations was developed for adult patients by colleagues at the University of Chicago. Although adult MeNTS scoring can be applied across adult surgical specialties, some variables were irrelevant in a pediatric population. Pediatric manifestations of chronic diseases and congenital anomalies were not accounted for. To account for the unique challenges children face, we modified the adult MeNTS system for use across pediatric subspecialties. RESULTS: This pediatric MeNTS scoring system was applied to 101 cases both performed and deferred between March 23 and April 19, 2020 at the University of Chicago Comer Children's Hospital. The pediatric MeNTS scores provide a safe, equitable, transparent, and ethical strategy to prioritize children's surgical procedures.

Value-Based Procurement (VBP) enables the implementation of VBHC by considering total cost of care and health outcomes to support better purchasing decisions. This poster advocates for a broader adoption of VBP in Latin America (LA). Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with six experts from academia, government, industry and multilateral organizations. A standardized questionnaire was used to identify case studies, key success factors and hurdles for implementation of VBP in LA. Experts provided supporting literature that was further expanded using the snowball technique. Results: We identified three examples: (1) Integrated Renal Care Services (Colombia), where the High Cost Account defines and record clinical outcomes financially rewarding those outperformers;(2) Vaccines value-based recommendation (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia), where a National Vaccine Advisory Committee selects the vaccine to be procured informed by a cost-effectiveness analysis;and (3) Diabetes Type 1 care model (Brazil), in a public-private collaboration defines and gather outcomes to support a value-based tender for 2022. Common key success factors include multi-stakeholder alignment on value attributes;monitoring and reporting performance indicators and the training of stakeholders. Hurdles identified included lack of IT infrastructure, price-based procurement mandates and institutional misalignment (finance, procurement, health agencies). Conclusions: Traditional procurement approaches undermine value realization from healthcare investments. Although we focused in 3 cases involving public funding, there are more examples in the private sector which demonstrate the feasibility and sustainability of a VBP approach.

On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified it as a pandemic. To examine the psychological effects on dental care providers in China in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak and factors closely associated with those effects, we conducted a cross-sectional study online with 4 widely used self-administered questionnaires: the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the General Anxiety Disorder-7, the Perceived Stress Scale-10, and the Acute Stress Disorder Scale. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the variables that potentially affected the mental health of emergency dental care providers. As a result, 969 out of 1035 questionnaires were included in the analysis, with 642 respondents reporting more than 1 symptom (66.3%). The symptom of perceived stress was reported by the largest proportion of the respondents (66.2%, nâ¯=â¯641), and anxiety the least (7.1%, nâ¯=â¯69). After adjustment for confounders, it was found that dental practitioners with preexisting physical health conditions were at higher risk of depression (odds ratio [OR], 1.972; 95% CI, 1.128-3.448; Pâ¯=â¯.017), and perceived stress (odds ratio, 2.397 95% CI, 1.283-4.478; Pâ¯=â¯.006). Additionally, feelings of fear, helplessness, or terror resulting from the possibility of contracting COVID-19 were significantly associated with the prevalence of all the 4 psychological symptoms observed (P < .05). In the present study, we found that dental care providers suffered psychological depression, stress, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during COVID-19, which indicates the importance of psychological support at times of major epidemic outbreaks.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to analyze whether COVID-19 in pregnant women is related to premature birth and birth weight, and to summarize the diagnostic results of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 for investigating the possibility of vertical transmission. Searches were performed in PubMed, Scopus, LILACS, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Preprints, bioRxiv, and medRxiv. We used the odds ratio (OR) and mean difference (MD) as measure of analysis. Summary estimates were calculated using random effects models. 38 studies were included; data from 279 women were analyzed; 60 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. The meta-analysis showed no significant association between COVID-19 and preterm delivery (OR = 2.25; 95%CI: 0.96, 5.31; p = 0.06; I² = 0%).

However, the overall community prevalence of infections has not been properly assessed, as standard surveillance is typically acquired passively among individuals seeking clinical care. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in which participants provided daily diaries and weekly nasopharyngeal specimens that were tested for respiratory viruses. These data were used to analyze healthcare seeking behavior, compared with cross-sectional ED data and NYC surveillance reports, and used to evaluate biases of medically attended ILI as signal for population respiratory disease and infection. RESULTS: The likelihood of seeking medical attention was virus-dependent: higher for influenza and metapneumovirus (19%-20%), lower for coronavirus and RSV (4%), and 71% of individuals with self-reported ILI did not seek care and half of medically attended symptomatic manifestations did not meet the criteria for ILI. Only 5% of cohort respiratory virus infections and 21% of influenza infections were medically attended and classifiable as ILI. We estimated 1 ILI event per person/year but multiple respiratory infections per year. CONCLUSION: Standard, healthcare-based respiratory surveillance has multiple limitations. Specifically, ILI is an incomplete metric for quantifying respiratory disease, viral respiratory infection, and influenza infection. The prevalence of respiratory viruses, as reported by standard, healthcare-based surveillance, is skewed toward viruses producing more severe symptoms. Active, longitudinal studies are a helpful supplement to standard surveillance, can improve understanding of the overall circulation and burden of respiratory viruses, and can aid development of more robust measures for controlling the spread of these pathogens.","Galanti, Marta; Comito, Devon; Ligon, Chanel; Lane, Benjamin; Matienzo, Nelsa; Ibrahim, Sadiat; Shittu, Atinuke; Tagne, Eudosie; Birger, Ruthie; Ud-Dean, Minhaz; Filip, Ioan; Morita, Haruka; Rabadan, Raul; Anthony, Simon; Freyer, Greg A; Dayan, Peter; Shopsin, Bo; Shaman, Jeffrey",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,407,20

There is ongoing evidence that exposure to PCB153 may influence gut microbiota health and increase the risk of host health. It is needed to illuminate whether there are associations between gut microbiota dysregulation and PCB153-induced host diseases. Importantly, it is urgently needed to find specific strains as biomarkers to monitor PCB153 pollution and associated disorders. The work aims to investigate the change of gut microbiota composition, structure and diversity and various host physiological indexes, to ravel the chain causality of PCB153, gut microbiota health and host health, and to find potential gut microbiota markers for PCB153 pollution. Here, adult female mice were administrated with PCB153. Obtained results indicated that PCB153 led to gut microbiota health deterioration. PCB153 exposure also induced obesity, hepatic lipid accumulation, abdominal adipose tissue depots and dyslipidemia in mice. Furthermore, specific gut microbiota significantly correlated with the host health indexes. This work provides support for the relationship between gut microbiota aberrance derived from PCB153 and risk of host health, and offers some indications of possible indicative functions of gut microbiota on PCB153 pollution.","Min, Lingli; Chi, Yulang; Dong, Sijun",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,407,24

Point-of-care ultrasound is without patient or staff exposure to ionizing radiation and enlists no additional staffing resources or patient transfer. METHODS: We conducted a chart review of all children who underwent reduction of a distal forearm fracture in the pediatric emergency department over a 2-year period, from September 2018 to September 2020. We compared length of stay (LOS) with that for orthopedist-performed distal forearm reductions during the study period. We allowed a 6-week lag period to ensure no missed rereduction before analyzing the data. After reduction, children were instructed to follow up with an orthopedist within 1 week. Children with loss of reduction on orthopedic follow-up are referred back through our emergency department for operative reduction. RESULTS: A total of 74 children with 75 distal forearm fractures were identified. Average LOS was 179 minutes for the pediatric emergency medicine physician reductions and 215 minutes for the orthopedist reductions (P < 0.001). Ninety-six percent of reductions were completed with POCUS assistance, and 61% had less than 5 degrees of angulation on postreduction radiography. Only 2.7% of children underwent rereduction. CONCLUSIONS: Distal forearm fracture reductions by a pediatric emergency medicine physician under POCUS guidance have a high rate of excellent alignment, low rate of failed reduction, and significantly shorter LOS (P < 0.001) than reductions performed by orthopedists.","Scheier, Eric; Balla, Uri",Pediatr. emerg. care,407,14

This study aimed to assess cognitive function in women delivering during the COVID-19 pandemic, as compared to women who delivered before the COVID-19 pandemic. A cohort study was performed during the immediate postpartum period of women delivering singletons at term. Cognitive function was assessed using an objective neurocognitive test (Symbol Digit Modalities Test SDMT90, SDMT4) and a subjective self-estimation questionnaire (Attention Function Index AFI). The exposed group was recruited during the COVID-19 outbreak in Israel (May 2020), whereas the comparison group consisted of women delivering at the same medical center before the COVID-19 pandemic (2016-2017). Multivariable regression models were constructed to control potential confounders. There were 79 parturients recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared with 123 women who delivered before the COVID-19 pandemic. Women delivering during the COVID-19 pandemic scored lower in the subjective AFI test compared to the unexposed group (70.0 ± 15.4 vs. 75.1 ± 14.7, p = 0.018). However, no significant difference was found in the objective SDMT tests scores. These results remained similar in the multivariable regression models when controlling for maternal age, ethnicity and time from admission to assessment, for AFI, SDMT90 and SDMT4 scores (p = 0.014; p = 0.734; p = 0.786; respectively). While no significant difference was found in objective tests, our findings propose that the exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic is independently associated with a significant decrease in subjective maternal cognitive function during the immediate postpartum period.","Hamami, Hagai; Sheiner, Eyal; Wainstock, Tamar; Mazor, Elad; Lanxner Battat, Talya; Walfisch, Asnat; Kosef, Tamar; Pariente, Gali",,407,22

The goal of this paper is to review the literature on previous infectious disease outbreaks to better understand and identify effective interventions that may help mitigate the psychological impact and collective trauma on a given community. Five strategies are recommended for developing a plan of action: (1) engage and partner with community leaders and community-based organizations; (2) establish (and re-establish) community support networks including self-help groups; (3) conduct community outreach, education, and training on the signs and symptoms of mental health issues, how to access mental health resources, and effective supportive and coping skills; (4) deploy Community Health Workers to access, engage, and educate community members; and (5) use a community capacity-building and community empowerment-oriented approach. When implemented together, these strategies have been shown to help communities reduce the mental health impact and heal from the collective trauma of an infectious disease outbreak and increase the collective efficacy of a community, resulting in increased resiliency and preparedness for future outbreaks.

There are currently no antiviral therapies approved for the treatment or prevention of mild to moderate COVID-19 as remdesivir is only approved for severe COVID-19 cases. Here, we evaluated the antiviral potential of a Propylamylatin formula, which is a mixture of propionic acid and isoamyl hexanoates. The Propylamylatin formula was investigated in gaseous and liquid phases against 1 mL viral suspensions containing 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2. Viral suspensions were sampled at various times post-exposure and infectious virus was quantified by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells. Propylamylatin formula vapors were effective at inactivating infectious SARS-CoV-2 to undetectable levels at room temperature and body temperature, but the decline in virus was substantially faster at the higher temperature (15 min versus 24 h). The direct injection of liquid Propylamylatin formula into viral suspensions also completely inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and the rapidity of inactivation occurred in an exposure dependent manner. The overall volume that resulted in 90% viral inactivation over the course of the direct injection experiment (EC90) was 4.28 µls. Further investigation revealed that the majority of the antiviral effect was attributed to the propionic acid which yielded an overall EC90 value of 11.50 µls whereas the isoamyl hexanoates provided at most a 10-fold reduction in infectious virus. The combination of propionic acid and isoamyl hexanoates was much more potent than the individual components alone, suggesting synergy between these components.

During this month, with few exceptions, the hospital became a 'COVID-19' centre. In addition, transfusion rates during this time frame and the same period over the last 4 years were compared. RESULTS: From 15 March to 14 April 2020, only 254 blood components were transfused, resulting in a 49·3% reduction over the previous year. Interestingly, in critically ill patients, the red blood cell (RBC) transfusion/bed ratio significantly decreased during this period (0·92) compared to the same ratio over the past 4 years (2·70) (P = 0·02). Of note, 106 blood components (95 RBC; 11 platelet concentrates) were transfused to only 36 out of 1348 COVID-19 patients (2·7%). The main reason for RBC transfusion in COVID-19 patients was a previous underlying disease (44%) followed by bleeding (25%) and inflammatory anaemia (25%). CONCLUSION: This is the first study to report a decrease in blood transfusions during the COVID-19 pandemic in a general hospital and especially in the intensive care unit. The results of this study suggest that COVID-19 does not generally induce transfusion requiring anaemia, being the main causes for transfusion in these patients underlying conditions or bleeding.","Marín-Mori, Karen; González-Gascón Y Marín, Isabel; Foncillas-García, María-Ángeles; Muñoz-Novas, Carolina; Infante, María; Churruca-Sarasqueta, Juan; Landete-Hernández, Elena; Bueno-García, Begoña; Duffort-Falco, Mercedes; Hernández-Rivas, José-Ángel",Vox sang,407,1

Treatments spiked with 20 mg/kg CTC (treatment P1), 100 mg/kg CTC (treatment P2), and the control (treatment CK) were operated. Results showed that CTC could be completely removed in the thermophilic phase of all the treatments despite of the initial concentrations. Bioavailable Cu in treatments CK, P1, and P2 declined by 14.5%, 27.1%, and 26.7% and bioavailable Zn declined by 15.3%, 29.5%, and 12.1%, respectively, after the composting, respectively.

We evaluated the predicted anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of major royal jelly protein (MRJP)2 and MRJP2 isoform X1, which recently showed high efficacy against other enveloped RNA-viruses (HCV and HIV). Some in-silico analyses have been performed to predict the impact of these proteins on viral entry, replication, and complications. These proteins have shown a high potency in sialic acid hydrolysis from the lung cells (WI-38) surface. Docking analysis showed that these proteins have a high binding affinity to viral receptor-binding sites in the receptor-binding domain, causing attachment prevention. Moreover, MRJPs can exert an inhibitory influence, via different mechanisms, for SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins (main and papain proteases, RNA replicase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and methyltransferase). Also, they can bind to hemoglobin-binding sites on viral-nsps and prevent their hemoglobin attack.

In March 2020, ASCO launched a survey of clinical programs represented on its Cancer Research Committee and Research Community Forum Steering Group and taskforces to learn about the types of changes and challenges that clinical trial programs were experiencing early in the pandemic. There were 32 survey respondents; 14 represented academic programs, and 18 represented community-based programs. Respondents indicated that COVID-19 is leading programs to halt or prioritize screening and/or enrollment for certain clinical trials and cease research-only visits. Most reported conducting remote patient care where possible and remote visits and monitoring with sponsors and/or contract research organizations (CROs); respondents viewed this shift positively. Numerous challenges with conducting clinical trials were reported, including enrollment and protocol adherence difficulties with decreased patient visits, staffing constraints, and limited availability of ancillary services. Interactions with sponsors and CROs about modifying trial procedures were also challenging. The changes in clinical trial procedures identified by the survey could serve as strategies for other programs attempting to maintain their clinical trial portfolios during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, many of the adaptations to trials made during the pandemic provide a long-term opportunity to improve and transform the clinical trial system.

This analysis aimed to 1) assess characteristics, capability to detect and monitor COVID-19, and disease control measures in these 24 countries, 2) understand potential factors for the reported delayed COVID-19 introduction, and 3) identify gaps and opportunities for outbreak preparedness, particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). We collected and analyzed publicly available information on country characteristics, COVID-19 testing, influenza surveillance, border measures, and preparedness activities in these countries. We also assessed the association between the temporal spread of COVID-19 in all countries with reported cases with globalization indicator and geographic location. RESULTS: Temporal spreading of COVID-19 was strongly associated with countries' globalization indicator and geographic location. Most of the 24 countries with delayed COVID-19 introduction were LMICs; 88% were small island or landlocked developing countries. As of 30 March 2020, only 38% of these countries reported in-country COVID-19 testing capability, and 71% reported conducting influenza surveillance during the past year. All had implemented two or more border measures, (e.g., travel restrictions and border closures) and multiple preparedness activities (e.g., national preparedness plans and school closing). CONCLUSIONS: Limited testing capacity suggests that most of the 24 delayed countries may have lacked the capability to detect and identify cases early through sentinel and case-based surveillance. Low global connectedness, geographic isolation, and border measures were common among these countries and may have contributed to the delayed introduction of COVID-19 into these countries. This paper contributes to identifying opportunities for pandemic preparedness, such as increasing disease detection, surveillance, and international collaborations. As the global situation continues to evolve, it is essential for countries to improve and prioritize their capacities to rapidly prevent, detect, and respond, not only for COVID-19, but also for future outbreaks.","Li, Zheng; Jones, Cynthia; Ejigu, Girum S; George, Nisha; Geller, Amanda L; Chang, Gregory C; Adamski, Alys; Igboh, Ledor S; Merrill, Rebecca D; Ricks, Philip; Mirza, Sara A; Lynch, Michael",Global Health,407,15

The motion estimate is used to adapt the radiation beam to the current anatomy, yielding a more conformal dose distribution. As the MR acquisition is the largest component of latency, deep learning (DL) may reduce the total latency by enabling much higher undersampling factors compared to conventional reconstruction and motion estimation methods. The benefit of DL on image reconstruction and motion estimation was investigated for obtaining accurate deformation vector fields (DVFs) with high temporal resolution and minimal latency.Methods: 2D cine MRI acquired at 1.5T from 135 abdominal cancer patients were retrospectively included in this study. Undersampled radial golden angle acquisitions were retrospectively simulated. DVFs were computed using different combinations of conventional- and DL-based methods for image reconstruction and motion estimation, allowing a comparison of four approaches to achieve real-time motion estimation. The four approaches were evaluated based on the end-point-error and root-mean-square error compared to a ground-truth optical flow estimate on fully-sampled images, the structural similarity (SSIM) after registration and time necessary to acquire k-space, reconstruct an image and estimate motion.Results: The lowest DVF error and highest SSIM were obtained using conventional methods up to R&#8804;10. For undersampling factors R>10, the lowest DVF error and highest SSIM were obtained using conventional image reconstruction and DL-based motion estimation. We have found that, with this combination, accurate DVFs can be obtained up to R=25 with an average root-mean-square error up to 1 millimeter and an SSIM greater than 0.8 after registration, taking 60 milliseconds.Conclusion: High-quality 2D DVFs from highly undersampled k-space can be obtained with a high temporal resolution with conventional image reconstruction and a deep learning-based motion estimation approach for real-time adaptive MRI-guided radiotherapy.","Terpstra, Maarten Lennart; Maspero, Matteo; D039,; Agata, Federico; Stemkens, Bjorn; Intven, Martijn P W; Lagendijk, Jan J W; Van den Berg, Cornelis A T; Tijssen, Rob H N",Phys. med. biol,407,32

MEASURES: Rates of primary care record access and re-presentation to the emergency department (ED) within 30 days and hospital admission. DESIGN: A retrospective observational study of 77 181 ED presentations over 4 years and 9 months, analysing 8184 index presentations in which patients' primary care records were accessed from the ED. Data were compared with 17 449 randomly selected index control presentations. Analysis included propensity score matching for age and triage categories. RESULTS: 6.3% of overall ED presentations triggered a lookup (rising to 8.3% in year 5); 83.1% of patients were only looked up once and 16.9% of patients looked up on multiple occasions. Lookup patients were on average 25 years older (z=-9.180, p<0.001, r=0.43). Patients with more urgent triage classifications had their records accessed more frequently (z=-36.47, p<0.001, r=0.23). Record access was associated with a significant but negligible increase in hospital admission (&#967;2 (1, n=13 120)=98.385, p<0.001, phi=0.087) and readmission within 30 days (&#967;2 (1, n=13 120)=86.288, p<0.001, phi=0.081). DISCUSSION: Emergency care clinicians access primary care records more frequently for older patients or those in higher triage categories. Increased levels of inpatient admission and re-presentation within 30 days are likely linked to age and triage categories. CONCLUSION: Further studies should focus on the impact of record access on clinical and process outcomes and which record elements have the most utility to shape clinical decisions.","Bowden, Thomas; Lyell, David; Coiera, Enrico",,407,26

Existing methods for spatial interpolation, such as variants of kriging and spatial autoregressive models, tend to suffer from at least one of the following limitations: (a) the assumption of stationarity, (b) the assumption of isotropy, and (c) the trade-off between modelling local or global spatial interaction. Addressing these issues in this work, we propose the use of Markov reward processes (MRPs) as a spatial interpolation method, and we introduce three variants thereof: (i) a basic static discount MRP (SD-MRP), (ii) an accurate but mostly theoretical optimised MRP (O-MRP), and (iii) a transferable weight prediction MRP (WP-MRP). All variants of MRP interpolation operate locally, while also implicitly accounting for global spatial relationships in the entire system through recursion. Additionally, O-MRP and WP-MRP no longer assume stationarity and are robust to anisotropy. We evaluated our proposed methods by comparing the mean absolute errors of their interpolated grid cells to those of 7 common baselines, selected from models based on spatial autocorrelation, (spatial) regression, and deep learning. We performed detailed evaluations on two publicly available datasets (local GDP values, and COVID-19 patient trajectory data). The results from these experiments clearly show the competitive advantage of MRP interpolation, which achieved significantly lower errors than the existing methods in 23 out of 40 experimental conditions, or 35 out of 40 when including O-MRP.","Arp, Laurens",,407,16

The molecular mechanism behind such variability is still under investigation. Several pieces of experimental evidence suggest that genetic variants influencing the onset, maintenance and resolution of the immune response may be fundamental in predicting the evolution of the disease. The identification of genetic variants behind immune system reactivity and function in COVID-19 may help in the elaboration of personalized therapeutic strategies. In the frenetic look for universally shared treatment plans, those genetic variants that are common to other diseases/models may also help in addressing future research in terms of drug repurposing. In this paper, we discuss the most recent updates about the role of immunogenetics in determining the susceptibility to and the history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We propose a narrative review of available data, speculating about lessons that we have learnt from other viral infections and immunosenescence, and discussing what kind of aspects of research should be deepened in order to improve our knowledge of how host genetic variability impacts the outcome for COVID-19 patients.","Pojero, Fanny; Candore, Giuseppina; Caruso, Calogero; Di Bona, Danilo; Groneberg, David A; Ligotti, Mattia E; Accardi, Giulia; Aiello, Anna",Int. j. mol. sci.

Activation of the RAS increases in patients with diabetes. The virus attaches to the ACE2 enzyme at low cytosolic pH values and enters into the cell and causes infection. Especially in the presence of diabetes mellitus and accompanying comorbid conditions such as hypertension, obesity, old age, and smoking, cytosolic pH is low, thus the virus easily may enter the cell by attaching to ACE2. ACEIs and ARBs lead to a reduction in angiotensin II level by increasing the ACE2 level, thus they cause a low cytosolic pH. Increased cardiac ACE2 levels due to ACEIs and ARBs can trigger cardiac arrhythmias and myocarditis by causing the virus to easily enter the heart tissue. There is ACE2 activity in the rostral ventrolateral medulla in the brain stem. The release of angiotensin 1-7 in the brain stem leads to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This activation causes systemic vasoconstriction and the patient's blood pressure increases. The most important event is the increased sympathetic activity via the central stimulation, this activity increases pulmonary capillary leaking, causing the ARDS. As the cytosolic pH, which is already low in patients with diabetes will decrease further with the mechanisms mentioned above, the viral load will increase and the infection will be exacerbated. As a result, the use of ACEIs and ARBs in patients with diabetes can lead to increased morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.","Cure, Erkan; Cumhur Cure, Medine",Diabetes Metab Syndr,407,16

The indispensable role of the main protease (Mpro) in viral replication and gene expression makes this enzyme an attractive drug target. Therefore, inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as a proposition to halt virus ingression is being pursued by scientists globally. Here we carried out a study with two objectives: the first being to perform comparative protein sequence and 3D structural analysis to understand the effect of 12 point mutations on the active site. Among these, two mutations, viz., Ser46 and Phe134, were found to cause a significant change at the active sites of SARS-CoV-2. The Ser46 mutation present at the entrance of the S5 subpocket of SARS-CoV-2 increases the contribution of other two hydrophilic residues, while the Phe134 mutation, present in the catalytic cysteine loop, can cause an increase in catalytic efficiency of Mpro by facilitating fast proton transfer from the Cys145 to His41 residue. It was observed that active site remained conserved among Mpro of both SARS-CoVs, except at the entrance of the S5 subpocket, suggesting sustenance of substrate specificity. The second objective was to screen the inhibitory effects of three different data sets (natural products, coronaviruses main protease inhibitors, and FDA-approved drugs) using a structure-based virtual screening approach. A total of 73 hits had a combo score >2.0. Eight different structural scaffold classes were identified, such as one/two tetrahydropyran ring(s), dipeptide/tripeptide/oligopeptide, large (approximately 20 atoms) cyclic peptide, and miscellaneous. The screened hits showed key interactions with subpockets of the active site. Further, molecular dynamics studies of selected screened compounds confirmed their perfect fitting into the subpockets of the active site. This study suggests promising structures that can fit into the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site and also offers direction for further lead optimization and rational drug design.","Gahlawat, Anuj; Kumar, Navneet; Kumar, Rajender; Sandhu, Hardeep; Singh, Inder Pal; Singh, Saranjit; Sjöstedt, Anders; Garg, Prabha",J. chem. inf. model,407,20

However, the extent of this effect requires further investigation. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between long-term exposure to air pollution and the case fatality rate (CFR) of patients with COVID-19. The data on air quality index (AQI), PM2.5, PM10, SO2 , NO2 , and O3 from 14 major cities in China in the past 5 years (2015-2020) were collected, and the CRF of COVID-19 patients in these cities was calculated. First, we investigated the correlation between CFR and long-term air quality indicators. Second, we examined the air pollutants affecting CFR and evaluated their predictive values. We found a positive correlation between the CFR and AQI (1, 3, and 5 years), PM2.5 (1, 3, and 5 years), and PM10 (1, 3, and 5 years). Further analysis indicated the more significant correlation for both AQI (3 and 5 years) and PM2.5 (1, 3, and 5 years) with CFR, and moderate predictive values for air pollution indicators such as AQI (1, 3, and 5 years) and PM2.5 (1, 3, and 5 years) for CFR. Our results indicate that long-term exposure to severe air pollution is associated with higher CFR of COVID-19 patients.

In the field of education, there was an increase in the privatization of higher education, inadequate to the requirements of national development, characterizing it more as a commodity than as a right. This article aims to discuss some challenges, risks, and possible strategies to face the impact of the COVID19 pandemic in undergraduate dental education. This pandemic had an immediate and dramatic impact on dental education in more than 130 countries, prompting teachers and students to adopt remote teaching activities. In Brazil, theoretical classes were offered remotely, mainly in private institutions where there was an intensification of academic work for both teachers and students. This process requires support in technological and pedagogical aspects, including tools, resources, and training courses. In the resumption of clinical education, changes in biosafety actions are being proposed to preserve the health of the actors involved. The application of these measures will imply a great mobilization of students, teachers, and technicians and extra attention so that the constitutive dimensions of the teaching-learning process in health are not minimized or forgotten.","Amaral, João Henrique Lara do; Palmier, Andrea Clemente; Werneck, Marcos Azeredo Furquim; Lucas, Simone Dutra; Senna, Maria Inês Barreiros",Pesqui. bras. odontopediatria clín. integr,407,16

First, we set out to establish a small molecule library using traditional structure-based drug design strategies and various computational tools. Small molecule design began by utilizing FTMap to identify ?hotspots? on the S protein binding domain (Chain B), which has been shown to interact with the hACE2 receptor (PDB file 6LZG). A hotspot was identified in the S protein-hACE2 binding domain. Within the probe cluster for this hotspot, the phenol probe was found to have strong interactions with the surrounding amino acids and thus selected as the initial scaffold. Based on the residues surrounding the hotspot, additional substituents were added to the scaffold to improve binding affinity to the S protein. AutoDock was used to sequentially evaluate the binding affinity of each small molecule to assess the effects of various substituents and geometries, thereby refining the small molecule library. Over 200 unique small molecules were rationally designed, which revealed two preferred substructures: fluorene and naphthalene-based molecules. The lead molecule from the fluorene substructure had a binding affinity of -9.1 kcal/mol (jmol156), and the lead molecule from the naphthalene substructure had a binding affinity of -8.5 kcal/mol (tmol35) (Figure 1). These molecules most strongly interact with Tyr505 via pi-stacking and Asn501, Gly496, Tyr453 and Gln493 via hydrogen bonding (Figure 2). Additionally, Tyr453 of the S protein, which participates in binding with hACE2, is partially blocked by both lead molecules. Overall, the jmol156 and tmol35 molecules show two preferred substructures that can be used for future drug design and demonstrate potential to serve as a starting point for in vitro testing.","Dufresne, Jason Kapanadze Tinatini Grove Laurie",The FASEB Journal,407,1

We aimed to investigate the role of the EGFR and Src-mediated STAT3 signalling pathway in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells. METHODS: The ER-positive luminal breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and T47D, were used. We have established an MCF-7-derived tamoxifen-resistant cell line (TamR) by long-term culture of MCF-7 cells with 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Cell viability was determined using an MTT assay, and protein expression levels were determined using western blot. Cell cycle and annexin V staining were analysed using flow cytometry. RESULTS: TamR cells showed decreased expression of estrogen receptor and increased expression of EGFR. TamR cells showed an acceleration of the G1 to S phase transition. The protein expression levels of phosphorylated Src, EGFR (Y845), and STAT3 was increased in TamR cells, while phosphorylated Akt was decreased. The expression of p-STAT3 was enhanced according to exposure time of tamoxifen in T47D cells, suggesting that activation of STAT3 can cause tamoxifen resistance in ER-positive breast cancer cells. Both dasatinib (Src inhibitor) and stattic (STAT3 inhibitor) inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in TamR cells. However, stattic showed a much stronger effect than dasatinib. Knockdown of STAT3 expression by siRNA had no effect on sensitivity to tamoxifen in MCF-7 cells, while that enhanced sensitivity to tamoxifen in TamR cells. There was not a significant synergistic effect of dasatinib and stattic on cell survival. TamR cells have low nuclear p21(Cip1) expression compared to MCF-7 cells and inhibition of STAT3 increased the expression of nuclear p21(Cip1) in TamR cells. CONCLUSIONS: The EGFR and Src-mediated STAT3 signalling pathway is activated in TamR cells, and inhibition of STAT3 may be a potential target in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer. An increase in nuclear p21(Cip1) may be a key step in STAT3 inhibitor-induced cell death in TamR cells.","Moon, Seo Yun; Lee, Heejin; Kim, Seoree; Hong, Ji Hyung; Chun, Sang Hoon; Lee, Hee Yeon; Kang, Keunsoo; Kim, Ho Shik; Won, Hye Sung; Ko, Yoon Ho",BMC Cancer,407,1

When present in the lumbar spine, they typically present with radiculopathy and weakness. CT imaging is helpful in assessing for bony involvement and temporal involvement while MRI imaging can be helpful in distinguishing hemangiomas from other mass lesions, however current reports on imaging features are limited. Diagnosis remains primarily dependent on tissue pathology with surgery as the mainstay of treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a unique case report in which we obtain additional DSA imaging to not only visualize the vascular anatomy associated with a L4-5 neuroforaminal capillary hemangioma involving the L4 nerve root and ganglion, but to also embolize the feeding artery prior to surgical resection. Patient initially underwent a CT-guided biopsy that was suspicious for a hemangioma and confirmed on final pathology to be the capillary subtype. DISCUSSION: When diagnosed appropriately, patients avoid unnecessary additional testing and avoid erroneous treatment of this rare lesion. Based on our experience, we propose initial MRI imaging to characterize the hemangioma and evaluate for intradural involvement, DSA to assess vascularity followed by embolization of the lesion when able in order to minimize intra-operative hemorrhage risk, and ultimately surgery to achieve a gross total resection.","Peng, Sophia; McGuire, Laura S; Saman, Karimi; Valyi-Nagy, Tibor; Mehta, Ankit I",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,407,10

FEPSim is a medical device for hand and wrist rehabilitation. The FEPSim device could be part of the standard of care for upper extremity rehabilitation during therapeutic activities to increase range of motion, dexterity, and strength. FEPSim has not yet been tested in a health care setting; therefore, a trial of the effectiveness of FEPSim in upper extremity rehabilitation is warranted. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial in terms of recruitment, eligibility criteria, the type and number of diagnoses included, the length and dosage of the intervention, and data collection methods. This study also aims to gather clinical and statistical information as well as information related to the cost and usability, which allows for an economic evaluation of the device. METHODS: The trial will use a randomized controlled design comprising 47 intervention participants and 47 control group participants. Participants will be adults (age&#8805;18 years) attending outpatient rehabilitation with limitations in their forearm, wrist, or hand function due to distal radial or ulnar fractures, stroke, or osteoarthritis. This study's primary outcome variables are related to patients' range of motion and strength, specifically active and passive wrist flexion and extension range of motion; active and passive forearm pronation and supination range of motion; grip strength; and pinch strength. The secondary outcome variables are related to patients' perceived wrist pain and disability in activities of daily living. The patients' perceived wrist pain and disability in activities of daily living will be measured using the patient-rated wrist evaluation questionnaire. The control group will receive the standard of care at each of the 2 hospital facilities (Glenrose Rehabilitation and Royal Alexandra Hospitals). The intervention group will receive the same standard of care as the control group at each facility and will use the FEPSim device for therapeutic activities to increase strength, range of motion, resistance, and dexterity. All the participants will be assessed at baseline (week 0); weeks 2, 4, and 8; and postintervention (week 10). RESULTS: The FEPSim study was launched in April 2020. This study is currently on hold because of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The recruitment process is expected to resume by September 2020, and the primary impact analysis is expected to be conducted by December 2020. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide valuable information on the measurement of comparative intervention effects, technology acceptance by hand therapists, and how associated treatment and product costs will contribute to the evidence planning process, which will be crucial for the future adoption of FEPSim.

COVID-19 affects predominantly the respiratory system, in addition to other organ systems, mainly the cardiovascular system. One of the hypotheses is that virus entering the target cells by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 affecting hypothalamic pituitary axis could lead to dysautonomia which is measured by heart rate variability (HRV). HRV is a non-invasive measure of autonomic function that facilitates identification of COVID-19 patients at the risk of developing cardiovascular complications. So, we aimed to assess HRV in COVID patients and compare between COVID patients and normal controls. METHODS: In a case control design, we compared 63 COVID-19 infected patients with 43 healthy controls matched for age and gender. Along with clinical characterization, heart rate variability was evaluated using ambulatory 5 min ECG in lead II and expressed in frequency and time domain measures. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0. RESULTS: Mean age of the study population was 49.1 ± 14.2 years and 71 (66.9%) were males. Frequency domain measures high (HF) and low (LF) frequency powers were significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients compared to controls. HF/LF and LF/HF ratios were not different between groups. Time domain measures rMSSD (root mean square of successive RR interval differences) and SDNN (standard deviation of NN intervals) were significantly increased among COVID-19 subjects. COVID-19 infection was associated with increased parasympathetic activity as defined by rMSSD>40 {adjusted odds ratio 7.609 (95% CI 1.61-35.94); p=0.01} and SDNN>60 {adjusted odds ratio 2.620 (95% CI 1.070-6.44); p=0.035} after adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Our study results showed increased parasympathetic tone in COVID patients. Early diagnosis of autonomic imbalance in COVID patients is needed to plan management and limit progression of disease.","Kaliyaperumal, Deepalakshmi; Rk, Karthikeyan; Alagesan, Murali; Ramalingam, Sudha",J. basic clin. physiol. pharmacol,407,29

Since currently, there is no causative drug against this viral infection available, science is striving for new drugs and approaches to treat the new disease. Studies have shown that the cell entry of coronaviruses into host cells takes place through the binding of the viral spike (S) protein to cell receptors. Priming of the S protein occurs via hydrolysis by different host proteases. The inhibition of these proteases could impair the processing of the S protein, thereby affecting the interaction with the host-cell receptors and preventing virus cell entry. Hence, inhibition of these proteases could be a promising strategy for treatment against SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we discuss the current state of the art of developing inhibitors against the entry proteases furin, the transmembrane serine protease type-II (TMPRSS2), trypsin, and cathepsin L.","Müller, Patrick; Maus, Hannah; Hammerschmidt, Stefan Josef; Knaff, Philip; Mailänder, Volker; Schirmeister, Tanja; Kersten, Christian",Curr. med. chem,407,0

Variant B.1.1.7, now dominant in the UK, with increased transmission, harbors 9 amino acid changes in the spike, including N501Y in the ACE2 interacting surface. We examine the ability of B.1.1.7 to evade antibody responses elicited by natural SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We map the impact of N501Y by structure/function analysis of a large panel of well-characterized monoclonal antibodies. B.1.1.7 is harder to neutralize than parental virus, compromising neutralization by some members of a major class of public antibodies through light-chain contacts with residue 501.

Aims: Retrieving the complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from India and subjecting them to analysis on phylogenetic clade diversity, Spike (S) protein mutations and their functional consequences such as immune escape features and impact on infectivity. Methods: Whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 isolates (n=4,326) deposited from India during the period from January 2020 to December 2020 is retrieved from GISAID and various analyses performed using in silico tools. Results: Notable clade dynamicity is observed indicating the emergence of diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants across the country. GR clade is predominant over the other clades and the distribution pattern of clades is uneven. D614G is the commonest and predominant mutation found among the S-protein followed by L54F. Mutation score prediction analyses reveal that there are several mutations in S-protein including the RBD and NTD regions that can influence the virulence of virus. Besides, mutations having immune escape features as well as impacting the immunogenicity and virulence through changes in the glycosylation patterns are identified. Conclusions: The study has revealed emergence of variants with shifting of clade dynamics within a year in India. It is shown uneven distribution of clades across the nation requiring timely deposition of SARS-CoV-2 sequences.

The COVID-19 outbreak is such a crisis and is boosted by the political turmoil related to the politicization of the pandemic in some countries. To assess the role of political partisanship, intolerance of uncertainty (IU), and conspiracy beliefs in our two criterion variables (support for COVID-19 prevention measures and compliance with social distancing), we applied an online questionnaire to 662 participants. Our results indicate direct effects of political partisanship on support for COVID-19 prevention measures and non-compliance with social distancing while IU has not directly affected any of them. We have also found a significant effect of political partisanship on conspiracy theory dimensions involving personal wellbeing (PW) and control of information (CI) but not government malfeasance (GM) ones. Moreover, beliefs in CI theories predicted non-compliance with social distancing. Intolerance of uncertainty, on its turn, predicted the three dimensions of conspiracy beliefs. As to interaction effects, belief in GM, PW, and CI conspiracy theories moderated the effect of political partisanship on support for COVID-19 prevention measures whereas only belief in GM and PW theories moderated the effect of IU on past non-compliance with social distancing. Overall, our results suggest the relevance of diminishing politicization around the virus, providing basic scientific knowledge to the general population, and assisting individuals in coping with uncertainty.

There is also a long-standing and concurrent rise in the prevalence and severity of substance use disorders (SUD). Therefore, the intersection between these two conditions needs to be carefully considered to ensure a more effective delivery of healthcare. RECENT FINDINGS: Generally, those with SUDs are more likely to have higher risk social determinants of health factors. Therefore, these patients are more likely to have barriers that can create difficulties in following appropriate infection control measures which in turn increases the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV2. In addition, these individuals have higher rates of medical comorbidities which increases the risk of all adverse outcomes, including mortality, from SARS-CoV2 infection. SUMMARY: Individuals with SUDs are at increased risk of both contracting SARS-CoV2 infection and suffering from worse outcomes afterwards. Though these risks of adverse outcomes are specific of SARS-CoV2 infection, the risk of exposure to other infectious diseases is increased in this population too. Healthcare providers and policymakers should then consider how to better protect this at-risk population and alleviate this increased disease burden.","Balaram, Kripa; Marwaha, Raman; Kaelber, David C",Curr Opin Psychiatry,407,1

Locally occurring disease resistance in various crops remains elusive. Here, we have observed that rice plants of the same cultivar can be differentiated into disease-resistant and susceptible phenotypes under the same pathogen pressure. Following the identification of a seed-endophytic bacterium as the resistance-conferring agent, integration of high-throughput data, gene mutagenesis and molecular interaction assays facilitated the discovery of the underlying mode of action. Sphingomonas melonis that is accumulated and transmitted across generations in disease-resistant rice seeds confers resistance to disease-susceptible phenotypes by producing anthranilic acid. Without affecting cell growth, anthranilic acid interferes with the sigma factor RpoS of the seed-borne pathogen Burkholderia plantarii, probably leading to impairment of upstream cascades that are required for virulence factor biosynthesis. The overall findings highlight the hidden role of seed endophytes in the phytopathology paradigm of 'disease triangles', which encompass the plant, pathogens and environmental conditions. These insights are potentially exploitable for modern crop cultivation threatened by globally widespread bacterial diseases.","Matsumoto, Haruna; Fan, Xiaoyan; Wang, Yue; Kusstatscher, Peter; Duan, Jie; Wu, Sanling; Chen, Sunlu; Qiao, Kun; Wang, Yiling; Ma, Bin; Zhu, Guonian; Hashidoko, Yasuyuki; Berg, Gabriele; Cernava, Tomislav; Wang, Mengcen",Nat Plants,407,0

This paper focuses on the incidence of the disease in Italy and Spain-two of the first and most affected European countries. Using two simple mathematical epidemiological models-the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model and the log-linear regression model, we model the daily and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the two countries during the early stage of the outbreak, and compute estimates for basic measures of the infectiousness of the disease including the basic reproduction number, growth rate, and doubling time. Estimates of the basic reproduction number were found to be larger than 1 in both countries, with values being between 2 and 3 for Italy, and 2.5 and 4 for Spain. Estimates were also computed for the more dynamic effective reproduction number, which showed that since the first cases were confirmed in the respective countries the severity has generally been decreasing. The predictive ability of the log-linear regression model was found to give a better fit and simple estimates of the daily incidence for both countries were computed.","Chu, Jeffrey",PLoS One,407,16

These efforts range from increased social awareness and social distancing (Sweden) to full country-wide lockdowns (Singapore, most of Europe, many states in the US). The effectiveness of various policies in containing the spread of the disease is still being studied by researchers. In this paper, using WiFi data collected directly from the infrastructure, we present a detailed analysis of the impact of virus related policies on the staff and students of three different college campuses. Two of these campuses are in Singapore, while the third is in the Northeastern United States. Our study focuses on two different key metrics, 1) Occupancy, defined as the number of people in a building, on average, in a specific hour, and 2) Mobility, defined as the number of places visited by an individual, on average, in a specific hour. We use these two metrics since they provide a strong indicator of how likely it is for virus to spread if there is an outbreak. Our results show that online learning, split-team, and other space management policies are effective at lowering Occupancy. However, they do not change the Mobility patterns for individuals who are still moving around. Reducing Mobility requires introducing strict stay-at-home or lockdown orders, but doing so increases Occupancy in residential spaces. We present our results and then discuss the implications of the findings for policymakers.","Zakaria, Camellia; Trivedi, Amee; Chee, Michael; Shenoy, Prashant; Balan, Rajesh",,407,20

The underlying reasons and mechanisms for this relative protection are not established. However both genetic and environmental factors might play a role. Polymorphisms in ACE2 gene, ACE gene and in genes for some of the host cell proteases could affect the viral entry and replication. There is some evidence that HLA polymorphisms and several pathways involved in immune and inflammatory response could contribute to ethnic variation. Cross immunity because of past exposure to viral infections as well as malaria is likely to protect from the severe manifestations of disease. Role of BCG vaccination in trained innate immunity is recognised and could be a protective factor against COVID-19. There is limited evidence of the possibility of a less virulent viral strain circulating in South Asia. There is evidence from different parts of the world that temperature and humidity can influence viral survival as well as the host immune response. Finally implementation of early containment measures by some South Asian countries has also contributed to a less disease burden.","Gupta, Ritesh; Misra, Anoop",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,407,10

We show that the existence of ultralight bosons with mass $ 2\times10^{-14}\lesssim \mu/\textrm{eV} \lesssim2\times10^{-13}$ would lead to an increased rate of hierarchical black hole mergers in nuclear star clusters. An ultralight boson in this energy range would result in up to $\approx60\%$ more present-day nuclear star clusters supporting hierarchical growth. The presence of an ultralight boson can also double the rate of intermediate mass black hole mergers to $\approx0.08$\,Gpc$^{-3}$\,yr$^{-1}$ in the local Universe. These results imply that a select range of ultralight boson mass can have far-reaching consequences for the population of black holes in dense stellar environments. Future studies into black hole cluster populations and the spin distribution of hierarchically formed black holes will test this scenario.","Payne, Ethan; Sun, Ling; Kremer, Kyle; Lasky, Paul D.; Thrane, Eric",,407,8

Treatment with cladribine tablets is effective and well tolerated in patients with active MS disease and have a low burden of monitoring during and following treatment. In this article, an expert group of specialist neurologists involved in the care of patients with MS in the United Arab Emirates provides their consensus recommendations for the practical use of cladribine tablets according to the presenting phenotype of patients with RRMS. The IRT approach may be especially useful for patients with highly active MS insufficiently responsive to treatment with a first-line DMT, those who are likely to adhere poorly to a continuous therapeutic regimen, treatment-naïve patients with high disease activity at first presentation, or patients planning a family who are prepared to wait until at least 6 months after the end of treatment.

Since then, the virus has also rapidly spread among Latin American, Caribbean and African countries. The first aim of this study was to identify new emerging COVID-19 clusters over time and in space in Latin American, Caribbean, and African regions [mostly low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)], using a prospective space-time scan measurement approach. The second aim was to assess the impact of real-time population mobility patterns between January 21st to May 18th, under the implemented government interventions, measurements and policy restrictions, on COVID-19 spread, among those regions and globally. An optimal assessment of monitoring and detection tools as well as population mobility patterns could help countries to better plan and prepare their strategies against the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We created a global COVID-19 database merging WHO daily case reports with other measures such as population density, country income levels for January 21st to May 15th, 2020. A score of government policy interventions was created ranging from ""light"", ""intermediate"", and ""high"", to ""very high"" interventions. Prospective space-time scan statistic methods were applied in five time periods between January to May 2020 and a regression mixed model analysis was used. METHODS: We created a global COVID-19 database merging WHO daily case reports with other measures such as population density, country income levels for January 21st to May 15th, 2020. A score of government policy interventions was created ranging from ""light"", ""intermediate"", and ""high"", to ""very high"" interventions. Prospective space-time scan statistic methods were applied in five time periods between January to May 2020 and a regression mixed model analysis was used. RESULTS: We found that COVID-19 emerging clusters within these five periods of time grew from 7 emerging clusters to 28 by mid-May. We also detected various increasing and decreasing relative risk estimates of COVID-19 spread among Latin American, Caribbean and African countries within the period of analysis. Globally, population mobility to parks and similar leisure areas during at least a minimum of implemented intermediate-level control policies (when compared to low-level control policies) was related with accelerated COVID-19 spread. Results that were almost consistent when the regional stratified analysis was applied. Also globally, population mobility due to working reasons during high and very high implemented control policies, when compared to low- level control policies, was related with positive COVID-19 spread. CONCLUSIONS: Prospective space-time scan is an approach that LMICs could use to detect emerging clusters in a timely manner and implement specific control policies and interventions to slow down COVID-19 transmission. In addition, real time population mobility obtained from crowdsourced digital data could be useful for current and future targeted public health and mitigation policies at a global and regional level.","Tyrovolas, Stefanos; Giné-Vázquez, Iago; Fernández, Daniel; Morena, Marianthi; Koyanagi, Ai; Janko, Mark; Haro, Josep Maria; Lin, Yang; Lee, Paul; Pan, William; Panagiotakos, Demosthenes; Molassiotis, Alex",J. med. internet res,407,16

Clinical assays, such as the CDC-promulgated N1, N2, and N3 have been used to detect and quantify viral RNA in wastewater but, to date, have not included estimates of reliability of true positive or true negative. Bayes Theorem was applied to estimate Type I and Type II error rates for detections of the virus in wastewater. Conditional probabilities of true positive or true negative were investigated when one assay was used, or multiple assays were run concurrently. Cumulative probability analysis was used to assess the likelihood of true SARS-CoV-2 detection using multiple samples. Results demonstrate highly reliable positive (>0.86 for priors >0.25) and negative (>0.80 for priors = 0.50) results using a single assay. Using N1 and N2 concurrently caused greater reliability (>0.99 for priors <0.05) when results concurred but generated potentially counterintuitive interpretations when results were discordant. Regional wastewater surveillance data was investigated as a means of setting prior probabilities. Probability of true detection with a single marker was investigated using cumulative probability across all combinations of positive and negative results for a set of three samples. Findings using a low (0.11) and uniformed (0.50) initial prior resulted in high probabilities of detection (>0.95) even when a set of samples included one or two negative results, demonstrating the influence of high sensitivity and specificity values. Analyses presented here provide a practical framework for understanding analytical results generated by wastewater surveillance programs.","Curtis, Kyle; Gonzalez, Raul Alexander",,407,1

This meant massive restraints for the population. Objectives: It was to be investigated whether the theory of reasoned action (TORA) is an adequate method for explaining the intention to follow the curfews and to explain whether anticipation of sanctions influences the intention. There are two key questions: (1) is the TORA suitable for explaining the intention to comply with the imposed curfews? and (2) does an extension of TORA by the variable sanction-anticipation influence the intention to obey the imposed curfews? Methods: Using an online survey, it was investigated the individual’s intention, attitudes and subjective norm to follow the restrictions, and also the anticipation of sanctions for noncompliance using a rating scale (1–7). Multiple linear regression and hierarchical regression analysis were used to clarify key questions. Results: In all, 1269 evaluable records demonstrated that the intention to follow the curfews is high (mean 6.24, standard deviation 1.2) and that this can be elucidated through the attitudes and subjective norm to 67% (p &lt; 0.001). There is no impact of impending sanctions for noncompliance (∆R 2 = 0.002). Discussion: The TORA is suitable for explaining the intention to comply with the curfews. Key political decision-makers should avoid threatening sanctions during speeches to increase compliance but instead emphasize the meaning and benefit of the measures for society and also for the individual’s own social environment in order to positively influence the intended goals.","Schillings, Johannes; Mohr, Mara; Mohren, Jessica",Pravent.

While coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is bestowed with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, involving the vital organs, the respiratory system transpires as the main route of entry for SARS-CoV-2, with the lungs being its primary target. Of those infected, up to 20% require hospitalization on account of severity, while the majority of patients are either asymptomatic or exhibit mild symptoms. Exacerbation in the disease severity and complications of COVID-19 infection have been associated with multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disorders, cancer, and chronic lung disease. Interestingly, a recent body of evidence indicated the pulmonary and gut microbiomes as potential modulators for altering the course of COVID-19, potentially via the microbiome-immune system axis. While the relative concordance between microbes and immunity has yet to be fully elucidated with regards to COVID-19, we present an overview of our current understanding of COVID-19-microbiome-immune cross talk and discuss the potential contributions of microbiome-related immunity to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and COVID-19 disease progression.","Cyprian, Farhan; Sohail, Muhammad Umar; Abdelhafez, Ibrahim; Salman, Salma; Attique, Zakria; Kamareddine, Layla; Al-Asmakh, Maha",Int J Infect Dis,407,1

Understanding the clinical characteristics, interactions with the environment, and the variables that favor or hinder its dissemination help the public authorities in the fight and prevention, leading for a rapid response in society. Using models to estimate contamination scenarios in real time plays an important role. Population compartments models based on ordinary differential equations (ODE) for a given region assume two homogeneous premises, the contact mechanisms and diffusion rates, disregarding heterogeneous factors as different contact rates for each municipality and the flow of contaminated people among them. This work considers a hybrid model for covid-19, based on local SIR models and the population flow network among municipalities, responsible for a complex lag dynamic in their contagion curves. Based on actual infection data, local contact rates ( ß ) are evaluated. The epidemic evolution at each municipality depends on the local SIR parameters and on the inter-municipality transport flow. When heterogeneity of ß values and flow network are included, forecasts differ from those of the homogeneous ODE model. This effect is more relevant when more municipalities are considered, hinting that the latter overestimates new cases. In addition, mitigation scenarios are assessed to evaluate the effect of earlier interventions reducing the inter-municipality flux. Restricting the flow between municipalities in the initial stage of the epidemic is fundamental for flattening the contamination curve, highlighting advantages of a contamination lag between the capital curve and those of other municipalities in the territories.","Miranda, José Garcia Vivas; Silva, Mateus Souza; Bertolino, José Gabriel; Vasconcelos, Rodrigo Nogueira; Cambui, Elaine Cristina Barbosa; Araújo, Marcio Luis Valença; Saba, Hugo; Costa, Diego Pereira; Duverger, Soltan Galano; de-Oliveira, Matheus Teles; Neto, Hildebrando Simões de Araújo; Franca-Rocha, Washington de Jesus Sant039; anna,; Jorge, Daniel Cardoso Pereira; de Oliveira, Juliane Fonseca; Andrade, Roberto Fernandes Silva; Rosário, Raphael Silva",Physica D,407,20

Limited data are available on how a patient's concomitant cancer diagnosis affected ethical concerns raised during the early stages of the pandemic. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all COVID-related ethics consultations registered in a prospectively collected ethics database at a tertiary cancer center between March 14, 2020, and April 28, 2020. Primary and secondary ethical issues, as well as important contextual factors, were identified. RESULTS: Twenty-six clinical ethics consultations were performed on 24 patients with cancer (58.3% male; median age, 65.5 years). The most common primary ethical issues were code status (n = 11), obligation to provide nonbeneficial treatment (n = 3), patient autonomy (n = 3), resource allocation (n = 3), and delivery of care wherein the risk to staff might outweigh the potential benefit to the patient (n = 3). An additional nine consultations raised concerns about staff safety in the context of likely nonbeneficial treatment as a secondary issue. Unique contextual issues identified included concerns about public safety for patients requesting discharge against medical advice (n = 3) and difficulties around decision making, especially with regard to code status because of an inability to reach surrogates (n = 3). CONCLUSION: During the early pandemic, the care of patients with cancer and COVID-19 spurred a number of ethics consultations, which were largely focused on code status. Most cases also raised concerns about staff safety in the context of limited benefit to patients, a highly unusual scenario at our institution that may have been triggered by critical supply shortages.","Friedman, Danielle Novetsky; Blackler, Liz; Alici, Yesne; Scharf, Amy E; Chin, Martin; Chawla, Sanjay; James, Monique C; Voigt, Louis P",JCO Oncol Pract,407,20

Among various thermoelectric materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with intrinsic high porosity and tunable physical/chemical properties are emerging as a promising class of materials that have been demonstrated to exhibit many unique merits for thermoelectric applications. Their structural topologies and thermoelectric properties can be facilely regulated by precisely selecting and arranging metal centers and organic ligands. Besides, a large variety of guest molecules can be incorporated within their pores, giving rise to novel avenues of raising energy-conversion efficiency. This review focuses on the recent advances in designing conductive MOFs and MOF-based composites for thermoelectric applications. It first introduces the fundamental thermoelectric parameters and the underlying regulation mechanisms specifically effective for MOFs, then summarizes the related studies conducted in recent years, where the structural design strategies of tuning thermoelectric properties are demonstrated and discussed.

The conventional diagnostic tests are time-consuming and have a low sensitivity. Digital PCR is a novel technology which can detect target sequences with relatively low abundance and obtain the absolute copy numbers of the targets. METHODS: We assessed the accuracy of dPCR in TB diagnosis using more than 250 specimens, and for the first time, we selected M.tuberculosis-specific IS1081 in addition to widely used IS6110 as the amplification targets for dPCR. The quantification of target DNA was calculated using QuantaSoft Version 1.7.4.0917 (BioRad), and SPSS version 13.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: IS6110-dPCR was more sensitive than IS1081, with the sensitivity and specificity accounting for 40.6 and 93.4% respectively. When we classified the TB patients by personal factors for high copy number of M.tuberculosis derived DNA in plasma: bilateral TB, extrapulmonary TB and disseminated TB, the sensitivity of both IS6110- and IS1081- dPCR was the highest in patients with disseminated TB (IS6110, 100%; IS1081, 68.8%), while their sensitivity was a bit higher in patients with extrapulmonary TB (IS6110, 50.0%; IS1081, 39.3%) than that in bilateral TB (IS6110, 43.3%; IS1081, 33.3%). Compared with traditional TB diagnostic tests, joint detection IS6110 & IS1081-dPCR was not as sensitive as smear microscope or mycobacterial culture, but it was higher than IS6110 qPCR (p < 0.05) and was able to detect 47.4% of smear-negative TB patients. CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that plasma IS6110-dPCR is a rapid, moderate accurate and less-invasive method to detect M.tuberculosis DNA in plasma of TB patients and IS6110 & IS1081-dPCR has a potential to aid diagnosis of smear-negative TB.","Lyu, Lingna; Li, Zihui; Pan, Liping; Jia, Hongyan; Sun, Qi; Liu, Qiuyue; Zhang, Zongde",BMC Infect Dis,407,8

Mortality in the preceding year or years is used to calculate the expected number of deaths, which is then compared with the actual number of deaths in 2020. We calculated weekly age- and sex-specific mortality rates for 93.1% of the Italian municipalities for the years 2015-2019 and for the first 26 weeks in 2020. We assumed the mortality experience during 2015-2019 as the reference period to calculate standardised mortality ratios. Furthermore, in order to compare the mortality experience of males and females, we calculated sex- and age- specific weekly direct standardised mortality rates and differences between the observed and expected number of deaths. We observed considerable changes in the demographics in the Italian population between the years 2015 and 2020, particularly among people 60 years and older and among males. The population is aging and the proportion of elderly males has increased, which was not reflected adequately in previous estimates of excess mortality. Standardized excess mortality results show that in Italy between the 8th and 26th weeks in 2020, there were 33,035 excess deaths, which is only 643 fewer deaths than the official COVID-19 death toll for this time period. A comparative increase in the mortality rates was observed in March among both sexes, but particularly for males. Comparisons with recently published data show considerably higher excess deaths, but these data were either not covering the complete country or did not account for age and sex.

A total of 1941 workers who were aged 20-64 years and suffered from body pain within 4 weeks prior to the study were included. Information was collected using a self-reported questionnaire between July and August 2020. Among the respondents, 15% reported that their pain worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately half of the workers claimed to have decreased physical activity (47%) and increased psychological stress (47%) during the pandemic.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 167 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 who underwent nasopharyngeal swab, and of a control group represented by 891 subjects negative for SARS-CoV-2, to assess the association between ABO and Rh blood system and occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical presentation, and outcome of disease. RESULTS: In the cohort of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2, no statistically significant difference in the distribution of ABO blood types compared with controls was observed. Patients with blood type A had a higher risk of developing symptomatic disease (p = 0.002; odds ratio [OR = 3.592]; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.576-8.187) compared to patients with blood types B, AB, and O. Patients with blood types B (p = 0.021; OR = 0.293; 95%CI = 0.099-0.869) and O (p = 0.018; OR = 0.417; 95%CI = 0.199-0.871) showed a lower risk in comparison to the other groups. The clinical progression to mild/moderate and severe/critical disease and the mortality showed no association. Moreover, no relationship with Rh blood type was found. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a role of ABO blood type in the development of symptomatic disease with a higher risk in subjects with blood type A and a protective effect of blood types B and O. Blood types do not seem, however, to play a role in susceptibility, progression to severe disease, and death.","Negro, Pierpaolo; Congedo, Maurizio; Zizza, Antonella; Guido, Marcello; Sacquegna, Gianfranco; Pulito, Giuseppe; Lobreglio, Giambattista",Transfus. med,407,26

In response to the potential treatment disruption due to COVID-19, the impact of dose delays and alternative dosing regimens on intravenous pertuzumab for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer treatment is presented. Simulations were conducted by using the validated population pharmacokinetic model for pertuzumab, and included (1) 4-, 6-, and 9-week dose delays of the 840 mg/420 mg every 3 weeks dosing regimen and (2) 840 mg/420 mg every 4 weeks and 840 mg every 6 weeks alternative dosing regimens. Simulations were compared with the currently approved pertuzumab dosing regimen. The simulations in 1000 virtual patients showed that a dose reload (840 mg) is required following a dose delay of &#8805;6 weeks to maintain comparable Ctrough (lowest concentration before the next dose is given) levels to clinical trials.

We aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic and NPIs on other notifiable infectious diseases under surveillance in Germany. Methods We included 32 nationally notifiable disease categories with case numbers &gt;100/year in 2016–2019. We used quasi-Poisson regression analysis on a weekly aggregated time-series incorporating trend and seasonality, to compute the relative change in case numbers during week 2020–10 to 2020–32 (pandemic/NPIs), in comparison to week 2016–01 to 2020–09. Findings During week 2020–10 to 2020–32, 216,825 COVID-19 cases, and 162,942 (-35%) cases of other diseases, were notified. Case numbers decreased across all ages and notification categories (all p&lt;0•05), except for tick-borne encephalitis, which increased (+58%). The number of cases decreased most for respiratory diseases (from -86% for measles, to -12% for tuberculosis), gastro-intestinal diseases (from -83% for rotavirus gastroenteritis, to -7% for yersiniosis) and imported vector-borne diseases (-75% dengue fever, -73% malaria). The less affected infections were healthcare associated pathogens (from -43% infection/colonisation with carbapenem-non-susceptible Acinetobacter, to -28% for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus invasive infection) and sexually transmitted and blood-borne diseases (from -28% for hepatitis B, to -12% for syphilis). Interpretation During the COVID-19 pandemic a drastic decrease of notifications for most infectious diseases and pathogens was observed. Our findings suggest effects of NPIs on overall disease transmission that require further investigation.

However, a major limitation in establishing such associations is to adequately account for complex disease dynamics, influenced by e.g. significant differences in control measures and testing policies. Another difficulty is appropriately controlling the effects of other potentially important factors, due to both their mutual correlations and a limited dataset. To overcome these difficulties, we will here use the basic reproduction number (R0) that we estimate for USA states using non-linear dynamics methods. To account for a large number of predictors (many of which are mutually strongly correlated), combined with a limited dataset, we employ machine-learning methods. Specifically, to reduce dimensionality without complicating the variable interpretation, we employ Principal Component Analysis on subsets of mutually related (and correlated) predictors. Methods that allow feature (predictor) selection, and ranking their importance, are then used, including both linear regressions with regularization and feature selection (Lasso and Elastic Net) and non-parametric methods based on ensembles of weak-learners (Random Forest and Gradient Boost). Through these substantially different approaches, we robustly obtain that PM2.5 is a major predictor of R0 in USA states, with corrections from factors such as other pollutants, prosperity measures, population density, chronic disease levels, and possibly racial composition. As a rough magnitude estimate, we obtain that a relative change in R0, with variations in pollution levels observed in the USA, is typically ~30%, which further underscores the importance of pollution in COVID-19 transmissibility.","Milicevic, Ognjen; Salom, Igor; Rodic, Andjela; Markovic, Sofija; Tumbas, Marko; Zigic, Dusan; Djordjevic, Magdalena; Djordjevic, Marko",Environ Res,407,4

On the other hand, CXR data with other findings are abundant. This situation is ideally suited for the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, where a lot of unlabeled data can be used through structural modeling by the self-attention mechanism. However, the use of existing ViT is not optimal, since feature embedding through direct patch flattening or ResNet backbone in the standard ViT is not intended for CXR. To address this problem, here we propose a novel Vision Transformer that utilizes low-level CXR feature corpus obtained from a backbone network that extracts common CXR findings. Specifically, the backbone network is first trained with large public datasets to detect common abnormal findings such as consolidation, opacity, edema, etc. Then, the embedded features from the backbone network are used as corpora for a Transformer model for the diagnosis and the severity quantification of COVID-19. We evaluate our model on various external test datasets from totally different institutions to evaluate the generalization capability. The experimental results confirm that our model can achieve the state-of-the-art performance in both diagnosis and severity quantification tasks with superior generalization capability, which are sine qua non of widespread deployment.","Park, Sangjoon; Kim, Gwanghyun; Oh, Yujin; Seo, Joon Beom; Lee, Sang Min; Kim, Jin Hwan; Moon, Sungjun; Lim, Jae-Kwang; Ye, Jong Chul",,407,24

A single controlled study reported the benefit of combination of folic acid with Pyridoxine & cyanocobalamin in terms of clinical and laboratory cure parameters. One hypothesis associates the differences in geographical variation of disease severity with prevalence of methyl tertahydrofolic acid reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism. Other possible domains, where FA is hypothesized to be beneficial are COVID-19 associated pulmonary hypertension and hyper-homocystinemia. So, scientific justification of using folic acid as placebo in COVID-19 trials seems scientifically not credible and this may be one of the major factors for failure of many agents.

To address this, wastewater with different physical characteristics was seeded with gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 and used to test the efficiency of PEG precipitation and adsorption-extraction to concentrate the virus from three physiochemically different wastewater samples, sourced from three distinct wastewater plants. Efficiency of viral concentration and RNA extraction was assessed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and the recovery yields calculated. As co-purification of inhibitors can be problematic for subsequent detection, two commonly used commercial master mixes were assessed for their sensitivity and efficiency to detect two SARS-CoV-2 target nucleocapsid (N) gene sequences. Recovery rates varied greatly between wastewater matrices and concentration methods, with the highest and most reproducible recovery rates (46.6-56.7%) observed when SARS-CoV-2 was precipitated with PEG and detected by the Luna® Universal master mix. The adsorption-extraction method was less effective (0-21.7%). This study demonstrates that PEG precipitation is the more robust method, which translates well to varying wastewater matrices, producing consistent and reproducible recovery rates. Furthermore, it is compatible with different kits for RNA extraction and quantitation.","Sapula, Sylvia A; Whittall, Jonathan J; Pandopulos, Aaron J; Gerber, Cobus; Venter, Henrietta",Sci Total Environ,407,20

Since then, the Ministry of Health has imposed mobility restrictions, a global policy implemented to mitigate the propagation of the virus. The national seismic network operating throughout Chile provides an opportunity to monitor the ambient seismic noise (ASN) and determine the effectiveness of public policies imposed to reduce urban mobility in the major cities. Herein, we analyse temporal variations in high-frequency ASN recorded by broadband and strong-motion instruments deployed throughout the main cities of Chile. We focus on the capital, Santiago, a city with more than 7 million inhabitants because it is seismically well instrumented and has high levels of urban mobility due to worker commutes inside the region. We observed strong similarities between anthropogenic seismic noise and human mobility indicators, as shown in the difference between urban and rural amplitudes, long-term variations, and variability due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The same results are observed in other cities such as Iquique, La Serena, and Concepción. Our findings suggest that the initially implemented public health policies and the early end to confinement in mid-April 2020 in the metropolitan region caused an increase in mobility and virus transmission, where the peak in anthropogenic seismic noise coincides with the peak of the effective reproductive number from confirmed positive cases of COVID-19. These results confirm that seismic networks are capable of recording the urban mobility of population within cities, and we show that continuous monitoring of ASN can quantify urban mobility. Finally, we suggest that real-time changes in ASN amplitudes should be considered part of public health policy in further protocols in Santiago and other high-density cities of the world, as has been useful during the recent pandemic.","Ojeda, Javier Ruiz Sergio",Solid Earth,407,16

Among those tests, a test for the neutralizing ability of an antibody is crucial for assessment of population immunity gained through vaccination, and to test therapeutic value of antibodies made to counter the infections. Here, we report a sensitive technique to detect the relative neutralizing strength of various antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We used bright, photostable, background-free, fluorescent upconversion nanoparticles conjugated with SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain as a phantom virion. A glass bottom plate coated with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) protein imitates the target cells. When no neutralizing IgG antibody was present in the sample, the particles would bind to the ACE-2 with high affinity. In contrast, a neutralizing antibody can prevent particle attachment to the ACE-2-coated substrate. A prototype system consisting of a custom-made confocal microscope was used to quantify particle attachment to the substrate. The sensitivity of this assay can reach 4.0 ng/ml and the dynamic range is from 1.0 ng/ml to 3.2 {\mu}g/ml. This is to be compared to 19 ng/ml sensitivity of commercially available kits.","Rajil, Navid; Esmaeili, Shahriar; Neuman, Benjamin W.; Nessler, Reed; Wu, Hung-Jen; Yi, Zhenhuan; Brick, Robert W.; Sokolov, Alexei V.; Hemmer, Philip R.; Scully, Marlan O.",,407,29

A panel of 10 plasma metabolites effectively distinguished COVID-19 patients from healthy controls (AUC = 0.975). Plasma lipidome of COVID-19 resembled that of monosialodihexosyl ganglioside (GM3)-enriched exosomes, with enhanced levels of sphingomyelins (SMs) and GM3s, and reduced diacylglycerols (DAGs). Systems evaluation of metabolic dysregulation in COVID-19 was performed using multiscale embedded differential correlation network analyses. Using exosomes isolated from the same cohort, we demonstrated that exosomes of COVID-19 patients with elevating disease severity were increasingly enriched in GM3s. Our work suggests that GM3-enriched exosomes may partake in pathological processes related to COVID-19 pathogenesis and presents the largest repository on the plasma lipidome and metabolome distinct to COVID-19.","Song, Jin-Wen; Lam, Sin Man; Fan, Xing; Cao, Wen-Jing; Wang, Si-Yu; Tian, He; Chua, Gek Huey; Zhang, Chao; Meng, Fan-Ping; Xu, Zhe; Fu, Jun-Liang; Huang, Lei; Xia, Peng; Yang, Tao; Zhang, Shaohua; Li, Bowen; Jiang, Tian-Jun; Wang, Raoxu; Wang, Zehua; Shi, Ming; Zhang, Ji-Yuan; Wang, Fu-Sheng; Shui, Guanghou",Cell Metab,407,24

The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and outcomes of conservative versus surgical management of AA during the pandemic. MATERIALS & METHODS: We conducted an observational study in a tertiary referral centre. Data was collected from all patients (&#8805;16 years) with a diagnosis of AA between November 1, 2019 to March 10, 2020 (pre-COVID period) and March 10, 2020 to July 5, 2020 (COVID period). RESULTS: A total of 116 patients in the pre-COVID period were included versus 91 in the COVID period. 43.1% (n = 50) of patients pre-COVID were classified as ASA 2 compared to 26.4% (n = 24) during the COVID period (p-value = 0.042). 72.5% (n = 66) of the patients during the COVID period scored as high risk using the Alvarado score compared to 24.1% (n = 28) in the pre-COVID period (p-value<0.001). We observed a significant increase in radiological evaluation, 69.8% versus 87.5% of patients had a CT in the pre-COVID and COVID periods respectively (p-value = 0.008). 94.9% of patients were managed operatively in the pre-COVID period compared to 60.4% in the COVID period (p-value<0.001). We observed more open appendicectomies (37.3% versus 0.9%; p-value<0.001) during the COVID period compared to the pre-COVID period. More abscess formation and free fluid were found intraoperatively in the COVID period (p-value = 0.021 and 0.023 respectively). Re-attendance rate due to appendicitis-related issues was significantly higher in the COVID period (p = 0.027). CONCLUSION: Radiological diagnosis of AA was more frequent during the COVID period. More conservative management for AA was employed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and for those managed operatively an open approach was preferred. Intra-operative findings were suggestive of delayed presentation during the COVID period without this affecting the length of hospital stay.","Antakia, Ramez; Xanthis, Athanasios; Georgiades, Fanourios; Hudson, Victoria; Ashcroft, James; Rooney, Siobhan; Singh, Aminder A; O039,; Neill, John R; Fearnhead, Nicola; Hardwick, Richard H; Davies, R Justin; Bennett, John M H",Int J Surg,407,4

The patient was assessed for lung transplant as a salvage therapy for treatment-refractory ARDS following no signs of clinical improvement for > 7 weeks, despite best treatment. The patient was transported from Mexico to Korea by air ambulance under venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. She was successfully bridged to lung transplant on day 88, 49 days after the initiation of ECMO support. ECMO was successfully weaned at the end of operation, and no bleeding or primary graft dysfunction was observed within the first 72 hours. The patient was liberated from mechanical ventilation on postoperative day 9 and transferred to the general ward 5 days later. Despite the high doses of immunosuppressants, there was no evidence of viral reactivation after transplant. At 3 months post-transplantation, she was discharged to home without complication. Our experience suggests that successful lung transplant for COVID-19-associated ARDS is feasible even in a patient with prolonged pre-transplant ECMO support. Lung transplant may be considered a salvage therapy for COVID-19-associated ARDS that does not respond to conventional treatments.","Oh, Dong Kyu; Hong, Sang Bum; Kim, Ho Cheol; Kim, Dong Kwan; Choi, Sehoon; Lee, Geun Dong; Jung, Sung Ho; Kang, Pil Je; Kim, Won; Park, Seung Il",J Korean Med Sci,407,24

Our study provides a novel method for the progress prediction, clinical treatment and prognosis of NCP, and has important clinical value for timely treatment of severe NCP patients. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the clinical features and severe illness risk factors of the patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), in order to provide support for the progression prediction, clinical treatment and prognosis of NCP patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 196 NCP patients treated in our hospital from January 25, 2020 to June 21, 2020 were divided into the severe group and the mild group. The clinical features of the two groups were analyzed and compared. The risk factors were explored by using multivariate logistic regression, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was obtained. The correlations of the risk factors with the prognosis of NCP were investigated combined with the lung function test. RESULTS: The primary clinical symptoms of 196 cases of NCP included fever in 167 cases (85.2%) and cough in 121 cases (61.73%). The chest computed tomography (CT) scans of the 178 cases (90.81%) showed a typical ground-glass opacification. In 149 cases, the lymphocyte count was decreased, while the levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), c-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and D-dimer (D-D) increased. 44 cases (22.45%) were found to be severely ill. The multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that age, underlying disease, length of hospital stay, body mass index (BMI), LDH, chest CT visual score, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and CRP were risk factors for severe.","Ye, Yingjian; Wu, Xiaxia; Li, Xiumei; Xu, Chunmei; Wang, Qingpeng; Yuan, Wenhuan; Zhang, Li; Li, Huan; Zheng, Lishi; Li, Qiongxia; He, Zhibing; Liu, Bo",Technol Health Care,407,1

Although the pandemic's impact was initially assumed to be temporary, there is growing conviction that medical education might change more permanently. The International Competency-based Medical Education (ICBME) collaborators, scholars devoted to improving physician training, deliberated how the pandemic raises questions about medical competence. We formulated 12 broad-reaching issues for discussion, grouped into micro-, meso-, and macro-level questions. At the individual micro level, we ask questions about adaptability, coping with uncertainty, and the value and limitations of clinical courage. At the institutional meso level, we question whether curricula could include more than core entrustable professional activities (EPAs) and focus on individualized, dynamic, and adaptable portfolios of EPAs that, at any moment, reflect current competence and preparedness for disasters. At the regulatory and societal macro level, should conditions for licensing be reconsidered? Should rules of liability be adapted to match the need for rapid redeployment? We do not propose a blueprint for the future of medical training but rather aim to provoke discussions needed to build a workforce that is competent to cope with future health care crises.","Ten Cate, Olle; Schultz, Karen; Frank, Jason R; Hennus, Marije P; Ross, Shelley; Schumacher, Daniel J; Snell, Linda S; Whelan, Alison J; Young, John Q",Med Teach,407,10

However, minimal data have been collected regarding perceptions about wastewater recycling between the populations in these two areas. While geographically close and economically linked, these two populations differ in terms of governance, income, and access to technology for wastewater recycling. To address the data gap pertaining to perceptions of wastewater recycling, a survey was administered among a convenience sample of subjects (n = 236) recruited from Eilat, Israel and Bethlehem, West Bank, from May to November 2018. The survey included questions addressing knowledge of water sources, water scarcity, and recycled water; willingness to use recycled water for produce irrigation and household tasks; and demographics. Israeli willingness to use recycled water for various purposes ranged from 8.3% to 55.1%, and more than half of Israeli respondents were willing to serve both raw and cooked produce irrigated with recycled water. Willingness to use recycled water ranged from 28.9% to 41.7% among the Palestinian respondents, and Palestinian respondents were more willing to engage in high-contact uses (i.e. drinking and cooking) than Israeli respondents. Among the Israeli respondents, experience or familiarity with wastewater recycling and water contamination were frequently significantly associated with willingness to use recycled water. In contrast, among Palestinian respondents, personal water contamination experience, home water safety testing, and trust in authorities to monitor recycled wastewater reuse were frequently significantly associated with willingness to use recycled water. Given the likely increasing water stress in both Israel and the Palestinian Territories, as well as the continued evolution of wastewater treatment technologies and the substantial amount of agricultural trade ongoing between Israel and the Palestinian Territories, it is important to identify effective and appropriate outreach and communication strategies to enable successful and acceptable water recycling.","Craddock, Hillary A; Rjoub, Younes; Jones, Kristal; Lipchin, Clive; Sapkota, Amy R",J Environ Manage,407,16

In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, our PNEE clinic switched to a telemedicine format, and we present here our experience with providing care to children and adolescents with PNEE in this format. METHODS: The multidisciplinary clinic shifted to a telemedicine platform in March 2020 with the same joint provider format. Follow-up phone calls are completed at one and three months following the visit. Data are presented with descriptive statistics. Referral volume and outcomes data are compared to historical patients, including rates of diagnosis acceptance, linkage to counseling, and change in event frequency. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were scheduled to be seen via telemedicine or hybrid visits from March through June, twenty completed their visits. Sixteen (70%) were reached for follow-up at one month. Of those reached, twelve (75%) accepted the diagnosis, eight (50%) were linked with counseling, and fourteen (88%) with improvement in event frequency. Of the sixteen reached at three months, eleven (69%) had accepted the diagnosis, ten (63%) were linked with counseling, and all but two reported improvement in event frequency. In comparison, the previously published results showed 3-month rates of 75% of patients accepting the diagnosis, 76% linked with counseling, and 75% with improvement in event frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Video telemedicine visits are a feasible and effective way to provide care for children and adolescents with PNEE. At 3â¯months, patients seen by telemedicine had similar acceptance rates, decreased connection to counseling, and increased rate of improvement in event frequency.

We undertook this meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic value of Neural networks (NNs) in Fine needle aspiration cytological (FNAC) image of cancer. METHODS: We systematically retrieved 396 literatures on cytodiagnosis of NNs from Cochrane, PubMed, and EMBASE. After screening, only six studies were included in meta-analysis finally. Data was comprehensively analyzed by RevMan and meta-Disc software. RESULTS: A total of 1165 cases were extracted from six articles. Among them, 593 cases were in the abnormal/positive group and 572 cases in the normal/negative group. The pooled estimates for the NNs cytology were Area under ROC curve (AUC): 0.99, Sensitivity: 0.85 (95% CI:0.82-0.88), Specificity: 0.96 (95% CI:0.94-0.97), Positive Likelihood Ratio (LR):18.43 (95% CI:6.83-49.74), Negative Likelihood Ratio (LR): 0.06 (95% CI:0.001-0.58), and Diagnostic odds ratio (DOR): 343.21 (34.41-3422.77).

Knowing the number is crucial for developing policy responses. There are generally two types of such a number, i.e., basic and effective (or instantaneous). While basic reproduction number is the average expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible, effective reproduction number is the number of cases generated in the current state of a population. In this paper, we exploit the deterministic susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model to estimate them through three different numerical approximations. We apply the methods to the pandemic COVID-19 in Italy to provide insights into the spread of the disease in the country. We see that the effect of the national lockdown in slowing down the disease exponential growth appeared about two weeks after the implementation date.

Design / Methodology / Approach: The research path involves three cases studies: two small but relevant producers of fruit and vegetable and a cooperative of family farmers in Rio de Janeiro through semi-structured interviews and concept maps. We also made data triangulation using literature review. Results: We observed that the main challenges for resilience in agro business are: 1) tight budgets and difficulty in accessing credit, 2) Many producers are in an informal fiscal situation, 3) Lack of human resources, 4) Low-technology methods, 5) Difficulty in adding value to “raw” products. Besides, we have also identified a dangerous reduction in federal investments in family farming incentive programs in recent years, which may have worsened the weaknesses of these businesses in the face of COVID-19 Limitations of the investigation: Since this is a qualitative study for preliminary investigation of the topic through mental models, the sample of focal respondents was small (three cases).

Scientific research in medicine is the only means to overcome novel and complex diseases like COVID-19. To sum up the therapeutic wild-goose chase, many available antivirals and repurposed drugs have failed to show successful clinical evidence in patient recovery, several vaccine candidates are still waiting in the trial pipelines and a few have become available to the common public for administration in record time. Objective and Method: However, with upcoming evidence of coronavirus mutations, available vaccines may thrive on the spirit of doubt about efficacy and effectiveness towards these new strains of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV2). In all these collective uncertainties, plasma therapy has shown a ray of hope for critically ill patients. Results: To date, with very few published case studies of convalescent plasma in COVID-19, there are two school of thought process in the scientific community regarding plasma therapy efficiency and this leads to confusion due to the lack of optimal randomized and controlled studies. Conclusion: Without undertaking any robust scientific studies, evidence or caution, accepting any therapy unanimously may cause more harm than good, but with a clearer understanding of SARS-CoV2 immunopathology and drug response, plasma therapy might be the silver lining against COVID-19 for the global community.","Saha, Sumit; Kadam, Sachin",,407,33

Although SARS-CoV-2 infections are not more prevalent in Parkinson's disease patients, a higher mortality rate has been reported not only associated with older age and longer disease duration, but also through several mechanisms, such as interactions with the brain dopaminergic system and through systemic inflammatory responses. Indeed, a number of the neurological symptoms seen in COVID-19 patients, as well as the alterations in the gut microbiome, are also prevalent in patients with Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, biochemical pathways such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and protein aggregation have shared commonalities between Parkinson's disease and COVID-19 disease progression.

Simulation using a compartment model is used to provide insight into differences in response to public health interventions. Two case studies of interest from Nizamuddin and Dharavi provide contrasting pictures of the success in curbing spread. METHODS: A cluster analysis of the worst affected districts in India provides insight about the similarities between them. The effects of public health interventions in flattening the curve in their respective states is studied using the individual contact SEIQHRF model, a stochastic individual compartment model which simulates disease prevalence in the susceptible, infected, recovered and fatal compartments. RESULTS: The clustering of hotspot districts provide homogeneous groups that can be discriminated in terms of number of cases and related covariates. The cluster analysis reveal that the distribution of number of COVID-19 hospitals in the districts does not correlate with the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases. From the SEIQHRF model for Nizamuddin we observe in the second phase the number of infected individuals had seen a multitudinous increase in the states where Nizamuddin attendees returned, increasing the risk of the disease spread. However, the simulations reveal that implementing administrative interventions, flatten the curve. In Dharavi, through tracing, tracking, testing and treating, massive breakout of COVID-19 was brought under control. CONCLUSIONS: The cluster analysis performed on the districts reveal homogeneous groups of districts that can be ranked based on the burden placed on the healthcare system in terms of number of confirmed cases, population density and number of hospitals dedicated to COVID-19 treatment. The study rounds up with two important case studies on Nizamuddin basti and Dharavi to illustrate the growth curve of COVID-19 in two very densely populated regions in India. In the case of Nizamuddin, the study showed that there was a manifold increase in the risk of infection. In contrast it is seen that there was a rapid decline in the number of cases in Dharavi within a span of about one month.","Sengupta, Pooja; Ganguli, Bhaswati; SenRoy, Sugata; Chatterjee, Aditya",BMC Public Health,407,16

The goals of this study were to report the load and variety of emergent/urgent neurosurgical cases after implementing the ""Battle Plan"" at an academic tertiary referral center during the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare these variables with previous practice at the same institution. METHODS: The clinical data of all patients who underwent a neurosurgical intervention between March 23, 2020, and April 20, 2020, were obtained from a prospectively maintained database. Data of the control group were retrospectively collected from the medical records to compare the types of surgeries/interventions performed by the same neurosurgical service before the COVID-19 pandemic started. RESULTS: Over a 4-week period during the COVID-19 pandemic, 91 patients underwent emergent, urgent, and essential neurosurgical interventions. Patient screening at teleclinics identified 11 urgent surgical cases. The implementation of the Battle Plan led to a significant decrease in the caseload, and the variation of cases by subspecialty was evident when compared with a control group comprising 214 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Delivery of optimal care and safe practice and education at an academic neurosurgical department can be well maintained with proper execution of crisis protocols. Teleclinics proved to be efficient in screening patients for urgent neurosurgical conditions, but in-person clinic visits may still be necessary for some cases in the immediate postoperative period.","Noureldine, Mohammad Hassan A; Pressman, Elliot; Krafft, Paul R; Greenberg, Mark S; Agazzi, Siviero; van Loveren, Harry; Alikhani, Puya",World Neurosurg,407,5

METHODS: A total of 100 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in intensive care unit (ICU) were enrolled and classified into moderate (n = 17), severe (n = 40) and critical groups (n = 43). Clinical information and laboratory results were collected and the concentrations of ferritin were compared among different groups. The association between ferritin and mortality was evaluated by logistic regression analysis. Moreover, the efficiency of the predicting value was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: The amount of ferritin was significantly higher in critical group compared with moderate and severe groups. The median of ferritin concentration was about three times higher in death group than survival group (1722.25 μg/L vs. 501.90 μg/L, p < 0.01). The concentration of ferritin was positively correlated with other inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-8, IL-10, C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that ferritin was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality. Especially, high-ferritin group was associated with higher incidence of mortality, with adjusted odds ratio of 104.97 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.63–4185.89; p = 0.013]. Moreover, ferritin had an advantage of discriminative capacity with the area under ROC (AUC) of 0.822 (95% CI 0.737–0.907) higher than procalcitonin and CRP.

Consequently, decision makers should be cautious about introducing monetary incentives and instead focus on interventions that increase confidence in vaccine safety first, as this has shown to be an especially important factor regarding the demand for the new COVID-19 vaccines.","Sprengholz, Philipp; Eitze, Sarah; Felgendreff, Lisa; Korn, Lars; Betsch, Cornelia",J Med Ethics,407,20

We aim to report the prevalence of and trends in the co-existence of obesogenic behaviors in adolescents from 15 countries. Methods: This study was based on the Global School-based Student Health Survey 2003–2017 and included 121,963 adolescents aged 12–15 years from 15 countries where at least 2 cross-sectional surveys were conducted. We used sampling weights and calculated the country-level prevalence of and trends in the co-existence of obesogenic behaviors (low fruit and vegetable intake, anxiety-induced insomnia, no physical activity, and sedentary behavior) during survey years. Pooled prevalence and trend estimates were calculated with random-effects models. Results: Pooled prevalence of exposure ≥ 1, ≥2, and ≥3 obesogenic behaviors was 88.2, 44.9, and 9.8% in the first survey and 88.4, 46.4, and 10.2% in the last survey, respectively. Plateauing, increasing, and decreasing trends in the co-existence of obesogenic behaviors were observed in different countries. Specifically, we identified a plateauing pooled trend in the exposure ≥ 1, ≥2, and ≥3 obesogenic behaviors [odds ratios (95% confidence intervals): 1.03 (0.93, 1.14), 1.05 (0.97, 1.13), and 1.06 (0.95, 1.18), respectively]. Conclusion: Trends in the prevalence of the co-existence of obesogenic behaviors varied significantly across different countries, but the prevalence remained high in most countries. These findings suggest the need for behavioral interventions to mitigate obesogenic behaviors in adolescents for overweight and obesity prevention.","Fan, Hui; Zhang, Xingyu",Front Pediatr,407,26

METHODS: Repeated cross-sectional data were taken from three waves of a nationally representative survey of individuals aged 18 to 74 years (wave 8: 21–22 April 2020, N = 976; wave 16: 7–8 July 2020, N = 977; wave 38: 9–10 March 2021). The willingness to accept a reduction of annual household income in order to bear the economic costs of the measures against SARS-CoV-2 served as outcome measure. Two-part models were used including explanatory variables on sociodemographic and (subjectively assessed) potential health hazard caused by COVID-19. RESULTS: 65.5% (61.6%; 56.9%) of respondents in wave 8 (wave 16; wave 38) were willing to accept a reduction of income, with the likelihood for accepting a reduction of income being positively associated with higher affect (i.e. emotional reaction) and presumed severity regarding COVID-19 in all three waves. The mean maximum percentage of income participants were willing to give up was 3.3% (95% CI: 2.9 to 3.7%) in wave 8, 2.9% (95% CI: 2.5 to 3.3%) in wave 16 and 4.3% (95% CI: 3.6 to 5.0%) in wave 38, with presumed severity of COVID-19 being positively associated with this percentage in all three waves. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of respondents indicated willingness to sacrifice income in order to bear the costs of measures against the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with the potential health hazard caused by COVID-19 being consistently associated with this willingness. However, the proportion of individuals who were willing to give up income slightly decreased throughout the pandemic.

AIM: To investigate the risk factors associated with ARDS in COVID-19, and compare the characteristics of ARDS between Wuhan and outside Wuhan in China. METHODS: Patients were enrolled from two medical centers in Hunan Province. A total of 197 patients with confirmed COVID-19, who had either been discharged or had died by March 15, 2020, were included in this study. We retrospectively collected the patients’ clinical data, and the factors associated with ARDS were compared by the χ² test, Fisher’s exact test, and Mann-Whitney U test. Significant variables were chosen for the univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. In addition, literature in the PubMed database was reviewed, and the characteristics of ARDS, mortality, and biomarkers of COVID-19 severity were compared between Wuhan and outside Wuhan in China. RESULTS: Compared with the non-ARDS group, patients in the ARDS group were significantly older, had more coexisting diseases, dyspnea, higher D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein. In univariate logistic analysis, risk factors associated with the development of ARDS included older age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04), coexisting diseases (OR = 3.94), dyspnea (OR = 17.82), dry/moist rales (OR = 9.06), consolidative/mixed opacities (OR = 2.93), lymphocytes (OR = 0.68 for high lymphocytes compared to low lymphocytes), D-dimer (OR = 1.41), albumin (OR = 0.69 for high albumin compared to low albumin), alanine aminotransferase (OR = 1.03), aspartate aminotransferase (OR = 1.02), LDH (OR = 1.02), C-reactive protein (OR = 1.04) and procalcitonin (OR = 17.01). In logistic multivariate analysis, dyspnea (adjusted OR = 27.10), dry/moist rales (adjusted OR = 9.46), and higher LDH (adjusted OR = 1.02) were independent risk factors. The literature review showed that patients in Wuhan had a higher incidence of ARDS, higher mortality rate, and higher levels of biomarkers associated with COVID-19 severity than those outside Wuhan in China. CONCLUSION: Dyspnea, dry/moist rales and higher LDH are independent risk factors for ARDS in COVID-19. The incidence of ARDS in Wuhan seems to be overestimated compared with outside Wuhan in China.","Hu, Xing-Sheng; Hu, Chun-Hong; Zhong, Ping; Wen, Ya-Jing; Chen, Xiang-Yu",World J Clin Cases,407,29

METHODS: A sample of 467 adults (M age = 33.14, 63.6% female) reported on mental health (depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], and somatic symptoms), demands and impacts of COVID-19, resources (e.g., social support, health care access), demographics, and psychosocial resilience factors. RESULTS: Depression, anxiety, and PTSD rates were 44%, 36%, and 23%, respectively. Supervised machine learning models identified psychosocial factors as the primary significant predictors across outcomes. Greater trauma coping self-efficacy and forward-focused coping, but not trauma-focused coping, were associated with better mental health. When accounting for psychosocial resilience factors, few external resources and demographic variables emerged as significant predictors. CONCLUSION: With ongoing stressors and traumas, employing coping strategies that emphasize distraction over trauma processing may be warranted. Clinical and community outreach efforts should target trauma coping self-efficacy to bolster resilience during a pandemic.","Samuelson, Kristin W; Dixon, Kelly; Jordan, Joshua T; Powers, Tyler; Sonderman, Samantha; Brickman, Sophie",J. clin. psychol,407,1

For Exp. 1, there were no four- and three-way interactions among premix type (PT), oil type (OT), storage condition (SC), and storage time (ST) for phytase stability (P > 0.111). There were two-way interactions for PT × SC (P < 0.001) and SC × ST (P < 0.001). The OT did not affect phytase stability when premixes-containing phytase were added as either mineral oil (MO) or MCFA (P = 0.382). For Exp. 2, there was no interaction between PT and OT (P = 0.121). There were also no differences for phytase stability between vitamin premix (VP)- and vitamin trace mineral (VTM) premix-containing phytase were heated at 60 °C (P = 0.141) and between premixes-containing phytase were mixed with 1% MO added and 1% MCFA (P = 0.957).

Since universal vaccination is a pillar against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), monitoring anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies is essential for deciphering post-vaccination immune response. Methods. Three healthcare workers received 30 g BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine, followed by a second identical dose, 21 days afterwards. Venous blood was drawn at baseline and at serial intervals, up to 63 days afterwards, for assessing total immunoglobulins (Ig) anti-RBD (receptor binding domain), IgG anti-S1/S2, IgG anti-RBD, IgM anti-RBD, IgM anti-N/S1 and IgA anti-S1. Results. All subjects were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at baseline. Total Ig anti-RBD, IgG anti-S1/S2 and IgG anti-RBD levels increased between 91-368 folds until 21 days after the first vaccine dose, then reached a plateau. The levels raised further after the second dose (by ~30-, ~8- and ~8-fold, respectively), peaking at day 35, but then slightly declining and stabilizing ~50 days after the first dose. IgA anti-S1 levels increased between 7-11 days after the first dose, slightly declined before the second dose, after which levels augmented by ~24-fold from baseline. The anti-RBD and anti-N/S1 IgM kinetics were similar to that of anti-S1 IgA, though displaying substantially weaker increases and modest peaks, only 4 to 7-fold higher than baseline. Highly significant inter-correlation was noted between total Ig anti-RBD, anti-S1/S2 and anti-RBD IgG (all r=0.99), whilst other anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies displayed lower, though still significant, correlations. Serum spike protein concentration was undetectable at all time points. Conclusions. BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination generates a robust humoral immune response, especially involving IgG and IgA, magnified by the second vaccine dose.","Danese, E.; Montagnana, M.; Salvagno, G.

Since then, several countries went into lockdown. We estimate the effect of the lockdown in France on the contact rate and the effective reproduction number Re of the COVID-19. We obtain a reduction by a factor 7 (Re=0.47, 95%-CI: 0.45-0.50), compared to the estimates carried out in France at the early stage of the epidemic. We also estimate the fraction of the population that would be infected by the beginning of May, at the official date at which the lockdown should be relaxed. We find a fraction of 3.7% (95%-CI: 3.0-4.8%) of the total French population, without taking into account the number of recovered individuals before April 1st, which is not known. This proportion is seemingly too low to reach herd immunity. Thus, even if the lockdown strongly mitigated the first epidemic wave, keeping a low value of Re is crucial to avoid an uncontrolled second wave (initiated with much more infectious cases than the first wave) and to hence avoid the saturation of hospital facilities.

Increasing studies indicated that there may be a correlation between herpes zoster and COVID-19. Nevertheless, the detailed pathophysiological mechanism is still unclear. We used bioinformatic analyses to study the potential genetic crosstalk between herpes zoster and COVID-19. COVID-19 and herpes zoster were associated with a similar subset of genes involved in “cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction,” “Jak-STAT signaling pathway,” and “IL-17 signaling pathway,” including TNF, IL10, ESR1, INFG, HLA-A, CRP, STAT3, IL6, IL7, and IL17A. Protein-protein interaction network assay showed that the combined gene set indicated a raised connectivity as compared to herpes zoster or COVID-19 alone, particularly the potentiated interactions with APOE, ARSA, CCR2, CCR5, CXCL13, EGFR, GAL, GP2, HLA-B, HLA-DRB1, IL5, TECTA, and THBS1, and these genes are related to “cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction”. Augmented Th17 cell differentiation and the resulting enhanced IL-17 signaling were identified in both COVID-19 and herpes zoster. Our data suggested aberrant interleukin-17 signaling as one possible mechanism through which COVID-19 could raise the risk of herpes zoster.","Yu, Xin; Li, Linfeng; Chan, Matthew T.

Despite mitigation of thrombosis during hemodialysis (HD), subsequent platelet dysfunction and tissue dysregulation are less understood. We comprehensively profiled plasma and platelets from ESRD patients before and after HD to examine HD-modulation of platelets beyond thrombotic activation. Basal plasma levels of proteolytic regulators and fibrotic factors were elevated in ESRD patients compared to healthy controls, with isoform-specific changes during HD. Platelet lysate (PL) RNA transcripts for growth and coagulative factors were elevated post-HD, with upregulation correlated to HD vintage. Platelet secretome correlations to plasma factors reveal acutely induced pro-fibrotic platelet phenotypes in ESRD patients during HD characterized by preferentially enhanced proteolytic enzyme translation and secretion, platelet contribution to inflammatory response, and increasing platelet dysfunction with blood flow rate (BFR) and Vintage. Compensatory mechanisms of increased platelet growth factor synthesis with acute plasma matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and tissue inhibitor of MMPs (TIMP) increases show short-term mode-switching between dialysis sessions leading to long-term pro-fibrotic bias. Chronic pro-fibrotic adaptation of platelet synthesis were observed through changes in differential secretory kinetics of heterogenous granule subtypes. We conclude that chronic and acute platelet responses to HD contribute to a pro-fibrotic milieu in ESRD.","Velasquez-Mao, Aaron J.; Velasquez, Mark A.; Hui, Zhengxiong; Armas-Ayon, Denise; Wang, Jingshen; Vandsburger, Moriel H.",Sci Rep,407,16

It remains unclear whether RTX-treated patients can develop a humoral and T-cell-mediated immune response against SARS-CoV-2 after immunisation. METHODS: Patients under RTX treatment (n=74) were vaccinated twice with either mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2. Antibodies were quantified using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein and neutralisation tests. SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses were quantified by IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays. Prepandemic healthy individuals (n=5), as well as healthy individuals (n=10) vaccinated with BNT162b2, served as controls. RESULTS: All healthy controls developed antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD of the spike protein, but only 39% of the patients under RTX treatment seroconverted. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 RBD significantly correlated with neutralising antibodies (τ=0.74, p<0.001). Patients without detectable CD19(+) peripheral B cells (n=36) did not develop specific antibodies, except for one patient. Circulating B cells correlated with the levels of antibodies (τ=0.4, p<0.001). However, even patients with a low number of B cells (<1%) mounted detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses. SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detected in 58% of the patients, independent of a humoral immune response. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that vaccination can induce SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in RTX-treated patients, once peripheral B cells at least partially repopulate. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells that evolved in more than half of the vaccinated patients may exert protective effects independent of humoral immune responses.","Mrak, Daniel; Tobudic, Selma; Koblischke, Maximilian; Graninger, Marianne; Radner, Helga; Sieghart, Daniela; Hofer, Philipp; Perkmann, Thomas; Haslacher, Helmuth; Thalhammer, Renate; Winkler, Stefan; Blüml, Stephan; Stiasny, Karin; Aberle, Judith H; Smolen, Josef S; Heinz, Leonhard X; Aletaha, Daniel; Bonelli, Michael",Ann Rheum Dis,407,26

Our paper does not claim to have found the cure for COVID-19, neither does it claim that the suggested model have taken into account all the complexities around the spread of the disease. Nonetheless, the fundamental question asked in this paper is to know if within the conditions taken into account in this suggested model, the integral lock-down is effective in saving human lives. To answer this question, a mathematical model was suggested taking into account the possibility of transmission of COVID-19 from dead bodies to humans and the effect of lock-down. Three cases were considered. The first case suggested that there is transmission from dead to the living (medical staffs as they perform postmortem procedures on corpses, and direct contacts with during burial ceremonies). This case has no equilibrium points except for disease free equilibrium, a clear indication that care must be taken when dealing with corpses due to corona-19. In the second case we removed the transmission rate from dead bodies. This case showed an equilibrium point, although the number of deaths, carriers and infected grew exponentially up to a certain stability level. In the last case, we incorporated a lock-down and social distancing effect, using the next generation matrix. We could achieve a zero reproduction number, with number of deaths, infected and carriers decaying very rapidly. This is a clear indication that if lock-down recommendations are observed the threat of COVID-19 can be reduced to zero in few months.While our mathematical model agrees with the effectiveness of the lock-down, it is important to mention damaging effects of inadequate testing. The long waiting period of few days before confirmation of status, can only lead to more infections. The asymptomatic tested person could be positive and spread the infection, or could contact the virus in days after testing and will spread the disease further, after being given a false result. Testing kit that with immediate results are needed for more efficient measures. We used Italy’s Data to guide the construction of the mathematical model. To include non-locality into mathematical formulas, differential and integral operators were suggested. Properties and numerical approximations were presented in details. Finally, the suggested differential and integral operators were applied to the model.","Atangana, Abdon",Chaos Solitons Fractals,407,16

Given that there is no effective treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, it is important to identify barriers and facilitators to adherence to social distancing to inform ongoing and future public health campaigns. METHOD: This cross-sectional study was conducted online with a convenience sample of English-speaking adults. The survey was administered over the course of three weeks (March 30 –April 16, 2020) when social distancing measures were well-enforced in North America and Europe. Participants were asked to complete measures assessing socio-demographic characteristics, psychological constructs, including motivations to engage in social distancing, prosocial attitudes, distress, and social distancing behaviors. Descriptive (mean, standard deviation, percentage) and inferential statistics (logistic regression) were used to describes endorsement rates for various motivations, rates of adherence to social distancing recommendations, and predictors of adherence. RESULTS: Data were collected from 2013 adults living primarily in North America and Europe. Most frequently endorsed motivations to engage in social distancing (or facilitators) included “I want to protect others” (86%), “I want to protect myself” (84%), and I feel a sense of responsibility to protect our community” (84%). Most frequently endorsed motivations against social distancing (or barriers) included “There are many people walking on the streets in my area” (31%), “I have friends or family who need me to run errands for them” (25%), “I don’t trust the messages my government provides about the pandemic” (13%), and “I feel stressed when I am alone or in isolation” (13%). Adherence to social distancing recommendations ranged from 45% for “working from home or remotely” to 90% for “avoiding crowded places/non-essential travel”, with men and younger individuals (18–24 years) showing lower adherence compared to women and older individuals. CONCLUSION: This study found that adherence to social distancing recommendations vary depending on the behaviour, with none of the surveyed behaviours showing perfect adherence. Strongest facilitators included wanting to protect the self, feeling a responsibility to protect the community, and being able to work/study remotely; strongest barriers included having friends or family who needed help with running errands and socializing in order to avoid feeling lonely. Future interventions to improve adherence to social distancing measures should couple individual-level strategies targeting key barriers to social distancing identified herein, with effective institutional measures and public health interventions. Public health campaigns should continue to highlight compassionate attitudes towards social distancing.","Coroiu, Adina; Moran, Chelsea; Campbell, Tavis; Geller, Alan C.",PLoS One,407,25

Antigen detection tests can be used to aid in the diagnosis of various infectious-related disorders including COVID-19 where it has become especially important due to the serious nature of this disease and its worldwide prevalence. These tests closely mimic one of the earliest prototypes – the urine pregnancy test – and as a result they have gained wide acceptance based on their overall simplicity, low cost and relative accuracy. In some situations, especially as a screening test, they can be used instead of the more technically demanding and complex molecular and serologic assays that are still useful and helpful under many different circumstances. Antigen detection systems are based on finding a particular immunogenic component, typically a protein or polysaccharide molecule, that is both unique and an integral part of the pathogen or other biological entity. Because these tests generally provide only qualitative results, they often need to be supplemented with other and sometimes more sophisticated laboratory-based diagnostic procedures to corroborate the initial test result. In this review, we first describe general background information on antigen-detection methods, including any unique aspects of their overall design, and then follow with an extensive description on the merits and limitations of these tests for detecting COVID-19 and, to a lesser extent, for other serious respiratory diseases caused by three common bacterial pathogens – Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila.","PAVIA, Charles; Plummer, Maria",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,407,4

In the presence of SARS-CoV-2 N-gene, the immobilized aptamer strands changed their conformation to specifically bind with N-gene. It thus increased the contact area or enlarged the distance between aptamer and the SPR chip, resulting in a change of the SPR signal irradiated by the laser (He-Ne) with the wavelength (λ) of 633 nm. Nb(2)C QDs were derived from Nb(2)C MXene nanosheets via a solvothermal method, followed by functionalization with octadecanethiol through a self-assembling method. Subsequently, the gold chip for SPR measurements was modified with Nb(2)C-SH QDs via covalent binding of the Au-S bond also by self-assembling interaction. Nb(2)C-SH QDs not only resulted in high bioaffinity toward aptamer but also enhanced the SPR response. Thus, the Nb(2)C-SH QD-based SPR aptasensor had low limit of detection (LOD) of 4.9 pg mL(−1) toward N-gene within the concentration range 0.05 to 100 ng mL(−1). The sensor also showed excellent selectivity in the presence of various respiratory viruses and proteins in human serum and high stability. Moreover, the Nb(2)C-SH QD-based SPR aptasensor displayed a vast practical application for the qualitative analysis of N-gene from different samples, including seawater, seafood, and human serum. Thus, this work can provide a deep insight into the construction of the aptasensor for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in complex environments.

The variation in the reproduction number (R(0); a measure to reflect the infectiousness of a disease) for COVID-19 transmission is evaluated for tropical and mid-latitude countries. Results suggest that mid-latitude atmospheric conditions are more favorable to COVID-19 transmission as compared to the tropical atmosphere.

The R(0) value further increased after 1 April 2020 over India, and the value of R(0) was found to be greater than 1, indicating that the epidemic was active. Moreover, the present study was also extended to understand the impact of global/Indian lockdowns on air quality and R(0) value for COVID-19 transmission. Our findings revealed that the global/Indian lockdown helped reduce the R(0) value of COVID-19 transmission, which is associated with atmospheric and air quality parameters.

Several characteristics of hospitalised cases, including variations in symptoms as well as radiological and laboratory findings, have been described. However, the exact clinical spectrum of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Oman is currently unclear. The objective of this paper was to describe the sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, as well as the treatment and clinical outcomes of the confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Al Nahdha Hospital, Oman. Additionally, factors associated with the severity of the disease were identified. Methodology This was a cross-sectional descriptive study of hospitalised COVID-19 patients. The required data were retrieved from the electronic health information system for the period from 3rd March to 9th May 2020. Information was recorded in a bespoke sheet and exported to SPSS Statistics (IBM, Armonk, NY) for analysis. Results A total of 102 admissions were included in this study. The mean age of the cohort was 49.9 (14.7) years. The majority were males (77.5%), and more than half were expatriates (56.9%). Diabetes and hypertension were found in 39.2% and 36.3% of the study population, respectively. Common symptoms encountered were dry cough (78.3%), fever (76.5%), and shortness of breath (SOB) (69.6%). Radiologically, bilateral infiltrations were present in 73.5% of the patients. Only 19 cases required critical care (18.6%), and those were mostly older [54.1 (13.4) years], males (89.5%), and non-nationals (63.2%). Significant factors associated with requiring critical care were symptoms of SOB (89.5% vs 65.1%, p=0.03), diabetes (68.4% vs 32.5%, OR=1.5, p=0.004), chronic artery disease (15.8% vs 3.6%, OR=1.7, p=0.04), and diagnosis of acute respiratory distress symptoms (63.2% vs 6.0%, p<0.001). Additionally, the mean ferritin levels were significantly higher in cases requiring critical care [2350.4 (423.8) vs 795.7 (554.3), p=0.005]. Depending on disease severity, the treatment included antibacterials, antivirals, heparin, and steroids. The utilisation of steroids was significantly higher in the cases requiring critical care (63.2% vs 26.5%, p=0.001). Among cases that required critical care (n=19), nine died (death rate=47.4%).

METHODS: All patients who had claims for drug susceptibility testing for TB from 2012 to 2016, which indicated culture-proven TB, were included. The first day of the infectious period was defined as 3 months before a doctor’s suspicion of TB in patients with respiratory symptoms and 1 month before in patients without symptoms. The last day of the infectious period was defined as one day before the prescription of anti-TB medications. Patients hospitalized during infectious periods were investigated and their hospitalization days were calculated. Records of medical procedures which increased the risk of nosocomial transmission by generating aerosols were also investigated. RESULTS: A total of 7,186 cases with 94,636 person-days of hospitalization with unrecognized active TB were found. Patients above 60 years of age accounted for 63.99% of the total number and 69.70% of the total duration of hospitalization. TB patients in the older age group showed a trend toward higher risks for hospitalization with unrecognized active TB. Patients in their 80s showed the highest risk (12.65%). Bronchoscopy (28.86%), nebulizer therapy (28.48%), and endotracheal intubation (13.02%) were common procedures performed in these patients during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of nosocomial exposure to TB in South Korea is still substantial. Hospitalization with unrecognized active TB, especially among the elderly TB patients could be a serious public health issue in South Korea.","Kim, Hyung Woo; Myong, Jun-Pyo; Kim, Ju Sang",Korean J Intern Med,407,24

The rapid global spread has demonstrated how the emergence of a novel pathogen necessitates new information to advise both healthcare systems and policy-makers. The directives for the management of COVID-19 have been limited to infection control measures and treatment of patients, which has left physicians and researchers alone to navigate the massive amount of research being published while searching for evidence-based strategies to care for patients. To tackle this barrier, we launched CovidReview.ca, an open-access, continually updated, online platform that screens available COVID-19 research to determine higher quality publications. This paper uses data from this review process to explore the activity and trends of COVID-19 research worldwide over time, while specifically looking at the types of studies being published. Materials and Methods The literature search was conducted on PubMed. Search terms included “COVID-19”, “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2”, “coronavirus 19”, “SARS-COV-2”, and “2019-nCoV”. All articles captured by this strategy were reviewed by a minimum of two reviewers and categorized by type of research, relevant medical specialties, and type of publication. Criteria were developed to allow for inclusion or exclusion to the website. Due to the volume of research, only a level 1 (title and abstract) screen was performed. Results The time period for the analysis was January 17, 2020, to May 10, 2020. The total number of papers captured by the search criteria was 10,685, of which 2,742 were included on the website and 7,943 were excluded. The greatest increase in the types of studies over the 16 weeks was narrative review/expert opinion papers followed by case series/reports. Meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized controlled trials remained the least published types of studies. Conclusions The surge of research that accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic is unparalleled in recent years. From our analysis, it is clear that case reports and narrative reviews were the most widely published, particularly in the earlier days of this pandemic. Continued research that falls higher on the evidence pyramid and is more applicable to clinical settings is warranted.","Jones, Rebecca C; Ho, Jasper C; Kearney, Hannah; Glibbery, Meghan; Levin, Daniel L; Kim, John; Markovic, Sara; Howden, Jillian; Amar, Maya; Crowther, Mark A",Cureus,407,26

Programmes that reduce travel burden by bringing cancer treatment to the patient's home, workplace or closer to the patient's home, in the form of satellite clinics or mobile cancer units, expand treatment capacity and are well received. Clinical trial data show that, compared with intravenous administration, subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of trastuzumab is preferred by patients with breast cancer (BC), saves healthcare professionals' (HCPs) time, reduces drug preparation and administration time and reduces direct and indirect costs. As such, s.c. trastuzumab is well suited to flexible care. The results of a Belgian study (BELIS) show that home administration of s.c. trastuzumab is feasible and preferred by patients with BC. Numerous programmes and pilot studies in Europe show that s.c. trastuzumab can be administered effectively in the patient's home, in primary care settings or local hospitals. Such programmes require planning, training, careful patient selection and technology to link patients, caregivers and specialists in oncology clinics. Once these elements are in place, flexible care offers patients with BC a choice of how treatment may be delivered and lead to improved quality of life, while reducing pressure on HCPs and hospitals. The concept of flexible care is particularly relevant amid the COVID-19 pandemic where guidelines have been developed encouraging remote care.","Wardley, A.; Canon, J.-L.; Elsten, L.; Peña Murillo, C.; Badovinac Crnjevic, T.; Fredriksson, J.; Piccart, M.",ESMO Open,407,24

Drug‐drug interactions with antiarrhythmic drugs and anticoagulants in these patients may lead to significant bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmias, or severe bleeding. It is important for clinicians to be aware of these interactions, drug metabolism changes, and clinical consequences when choosing antiarrhythmic drugs and anticoagulants for COVID‐19 patients with atrial fibrillation.

This article describes the clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients who survived the disease through mechanical circulatory support (MCS). Methods: We studied 25 critically ill COVID-19 patients who underwent MCS from January 20, 2020, to April 10, 2020, at the Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Results: Thirteen (52%) of the 25 patients survived with MCS support, while 12 (48%) died. At the time of their hospital admission, we identified significant differences in their peak cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and Interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels, as well as in their lymphocyte count and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Cox proportional hazards regression model revealed that receipt of renal replacement therapy (RRT) was associated with an approximately 20-fold improvement in survival [hazard ratio (HR) =0.049, 95% confidence interval (CI) =0.008 to 0.305]. The number of days spent on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support and the use of hydrogen (pH) at the time of MCS was also associated with an increase in survival. This contrasted with high-sensitivity C-reactive proteins (hs-CRP) and lactate, associated with a decrease in survival during MCS. Further analysis of the determinants relating to a COVID-19 patient's chance of survival on/after MCS was also indicated by levels of IL-6 (beta=0.009, P=0.006), IL-8 (beta=0.031, P=0.020), and TNF-alpha (beta=0.107, P=0.014), which saw a significant increase in the 12 patients who died. This contrasts with the non-significant decrease in IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha levels in the 13 patients who survived. Conclusions: These results indicate that pH, lactate, hs-CRP, ECMO duration, and RRT are important clinical determinants for assessing how MCS can increase the chances of critically ill COVID-19 patients surviving the disease.","Li, R.; Hu, S.

DESIGN: Controlled trial with participants randomized to either usual care or 1-to-1 visits with a family caregiver peer mentor during the ABI inpatient rehabilitation stay. SETTING: Nonprofit rehabilitation hospital specializing in care of persons with brain and spinal cord injury. PARTICIPANTS: Caregivers (N=36) of patients with ABI admitted for rehabilitation whose discharge location was home with care provided by family members (caregivers: 93% female; 58% White; mean age, 48±10.4y). INTERVENTIONS: One-to-one peer mentoring visits during the inpatient stay with a trained peer mentor who is also a family caregiver of a survivor of brain injury. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of participation in support services for family caregivers, reported caregiver stress, and reported caregiver depressive symptoms. RESULTS: There was no difference between groups in participation in support services for family caregivers. Participants in the peer mentor intervention group reported significantly greater improvement in caregiver stress at discharge and 30 days post discharge than participants in the usual care group. Reported depressive symptoms were also lower for the intervention group, but change scores did not achieve statistical significance at discharge or 30-day follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Peer mentoring appears to improve caregivers’ ability to handle the stress of caregiving and reduces reported depressive symptoms. There was no between-group difference noted in participation in support services for families; however, participation was adversely affected by restrictions imposed during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, which may have masked any effect.","Jones, Michael; Holley, Claire; Jacobs, Mariellen; Batchelor, Ruth; Mangin, Ashley",Arch Rehabil Res Clin Transl,407,24

The tragedy has not yet fully run its course, but it is already clear that the crisis is thoroughly global, and science is at the forefront in the fight against the virus. This includes medical professionals trying to cure the sick at risk to their own health; public health management tracking the virus and guardedly calling on such measures as social distancing to curb its spread; and researchers now engaged in the development of diagnostics, monitoring methods, treatments and vaccines. Recent advances in non-contact sensing to improve health care is the motivation of this study in order to contribute to the containment of the COVID-19 outbreak. The objective of this study is to articulate an innovative solution for early diagnosis of COVID-19 symptoms such as abnormal breathing rate, coughing and other vital health problems.

It also plays an active role in the regulation of the systemic inflammatory response. Systemic inflammatory disease often results in alterations in vascular endothelium barrier function, increased permeability, excessive leukocyte trafficking, and reactive oxygen species production, leading to organ damage. Therapeutics targeting endothelium inflammation are urgently needed, but strong concerns regarding the level of phenotypic heterogeneity of microvascular endothelial cells between different organs and species have been expressed. Microvascular endothelial cell heterogeneity in different organs and organ-specific variations in endothelial cell structure and function are regulated by intrinsic signals that are differentially expressed across organs and species; a result of this is that neutrophil recruitment to discrete organs may be regulated differently. In this review, we will discuss the morphological and functional variations in differently originated microvascular endothelia and discuss how these variances affect systemic function in response to inflammation. We will review emerging in vivo and in vitro models and techniques, including microphysiological devices, proteomics, and RNA sequencing used to study the cellular and molecular heterogeneity of endothelia from different organs. A better understanding of microvascular endothelial cell heterogeneity will provide a roadmap for developing novel therapeutics to target the endothelium.","Yang, Qingliang; Wijerathne, Harshani; Langston, Jordan C.; Kiani, Mohammad F.; Kilpatrick, Laurie E.",Int J Mol Sci,407,16

We study three stake levels: 5€ (n = 177), 100€ (n = 168), and 1,000€ (n = 171). Although the donations increase in absolute terms as the stakes increase, subjects decrease the donated fraction of the pie. However, people still share roughly 20% of 1,000€, an amount as high as the average monthly salary of people at the age of our subjects. The number of people sharing 50% of the pie is remarkably stable across stakes, but donating the the whole pie–the modal behavior in charity-donation experiments–disappears with stakes. Such hyper-altruistic behavior thus seems to be an artifact of the stakes typically employed in economic and psychological experiments. Our findings point out that sharing with others is a prevalent human feature, but stakes are an important determinant of sharing. Policies promoted via prosocial frames (e.g., stressing the effects of mask-wearing or social distancing on others during the Covid-19 pandemic or environmentally-friendly behaviors on future generations) may thus be miscalibrated if they disregard the stakes at play.","Brañas-Garza, Pablo; Jorrat, Diego; Kovářík, Jaromír; López, María C.",PLoS One,407,1

Alongside advanced age, male gender and pre-existing co-morbidities [e.g., obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D)] are emerging as significant risk factors for COVID-19. Interestingly, immunesenescence is more profound in males when compared to females, whilst accelerated aging of the immune system, termed premature immunesenescence, has been described in obese subjects and T2D patients. Thus, as three distinct demographic groups with an increased susceptibility to COVID-19 share a common immune profile, could immunesenescence be a generic contributory factor in the development of severe COVID-19? Here, by focussing on three key aspects of an immune response, namely pathogen recognition, elimination and resolution, we address this question by discussing how immunesenescence may weaken or exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. We also highlight how aspects of immunesenescence could render potential COVID-19 treatments less effective in older adults and draw attention to certain therapeutic options, which by reversing or circumventing certain features of immunesenescence may prove to be beneficial for the treatment of groups at high risk of severe COVID-19.","Hazeldine, Jon; Lord, Janet M.",Front Immunol,407,6

Methods: A probe-directed recombinase amplification (PDRA) assay was discussed to detect the D614G mutation at 39 ℃ for 30 min. The sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of the PDRA were evaluated by D614 and G614 recombinant plasmids. The clinical performance of PDRA assay was validated by testing of 53 previously confirmed COVID-19 positive RNAs and 10 negative samples. Direct sequencing was carried out in parallel for comparison. Result: With good reproducibility and specificity, the PDRA assay worked well with the concentration in the range of 10(3)–10(7) copies/reaction.

The findings indicate an increase in depression and anxiety but have been limited by the lack of specificity about which aspects of the pandemic (e.g. viral exposure or economic threats) have led to adverse mental health outcomes. METHODS: Network analyses were conducted on data from wave 1 (N = 2025, recruited 23 March–28 March 2020) and wave 2 (N = 1406, recontacts 22 April–1 May 2020) of the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium Study, an online longitudinal survey of a representative sample of the UK adult population. Our models included depression (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety (GAD-7) and trauma symptoms (ITQ); and measures of COVID-specific anxiety, exposure to the virus in self and close others, as well as economic loss due to the pandemic. RESULTS: A mixed graphical model at wave 1 identified a potential pathway from economic adversity to anxiety symptoms via COVID-specific anxiety. There was no association between viral exposure and symptoms. Ising network models using clinical cut-offs for symptom scores at each wave yielded similar findings, with the exception of a modest effect of viral exposure on trauma symptoms at wave 1 only. Anxiety and depression symptoms formed separate clusters at wave 1 but not wave 2. CONCLUSIONS: The psychological impact of the pandemic evolved in the early phase of lockdown.

Furthermore, assignment to risk groups for severe courses of COVID-19 caused by noncommunicable diseases (eg, cardiovascular diseases) is not possible due to inadequate data availability. Information on people living in slums and their health status is either unavailable or only exists for specific regions (eg, Nairobi).

Whole genome sequencing based on NGS technologies is the method of choice to identify all viral variants; however, the resources needed to use these techniques for a representative number of specimens remain limited in many low and middle income countries. To decrease sequencing cost, we developed a couple of primers allowing to generate partial sequences in the viral S gene allowing rapid detection of numerous variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs); whole genome sequencing is then performed on a selection of viruses based on partial sequencing results. Two hundred and one nasopharyngeal specimens collected during the decreasing phase of a high transmission COVID-19 wave in T unisia were analyzed. The results reveal high genetic variability within the sequenced fragment and allowed the detection of first introduction in the country of already known VOCs and VOIs as well as others variants that have interesting genomic mutations and need to be kept under surveillance. Importance The method of choice for SARS-CoV-2 variants detection is whole genome sequencing using NGS technologies. Resources for this technology remain limited in many low and middle income countries where it is not possible to perform whole genome sequencing for representative number of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases.

Viral genome is capped at the 5’-end, followed by an untranslated region (UTR). There is poly-A tail at 3’-end, preceded by an UTR. Self-interaction between the RNA regulatory elements present within 5’- and 3’-UTRs as well as their interaction with host/virus-encoded proteins mediate the function of 5’- and 3’-UTRs. Using RNA-protein interaction detection (RaPID) assay coupled to liquid chromatography with tandem mass-spectrometry, we identified host interaction partners of SARS-CoV-2 5’- and 3’-UTRs and generated an RNA-protein interaction network. By combining these data with the previously known protein-protein interaction data proposed to be involved in virus replication, we generated the RNA-protein-protein interaction (RPPI) network, likely to be essential for controlling SARS-CoV-2 replication. Notably, bioinformatics analysis of the RPPI network revealed the enrichment of factors involved in translation initiation and RNA metabolism. Lysosome-associated membrane protein-2a (Lamp2a) was one of the host proteins that interact with the 5’-UTR. Further studies showed that Lamp2 level is upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and overexpression of Lamp2a and Lamp2b variants reduced viral RNA level in infected cells and vice versa. In summary, our study provides an useful resource of SARS-CoV-2 5’- and 3’-UTR binding proteins and reveal the antiviral function of host Lamp2 protein. Importance Replication of a positive-strand RNA virus involves an RNA-protein complex consisting of viral genomic RNA, host RNA(s), virus-encoded proteins and host proteins. Dissecting out individual components of the replication complex will help decode the mechanism of viral replication. 5’- and 3’-UTRs in positive-strand RNA viruses play essential regulatory roles in virus replication. Here, we identified the host proteins that associate with the UTRs of SARS-CoV-2, combined those data with the previously known protein-protein interaction data (expected to be involved in virus replication) and generated the RNA-protein-protein interaction (RPPI) network. Analysis of the RPPI network revealed the enrichment of factors involved in translation initiation and RNA metabolism, which are important for virus replication. Analysis of one of the interaction partners of the 5’-UTR (Lamp2a) demonstrated its antiviral role in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Collectively, our study provides a resource of SARS-CoV-2 UTR-binding proteins and identifies an antiviral role of host Lamp2a protein.","Verma, Rohit; Saha, Sandhini; Kumar, Shiv; Mani, Shailendra; Maiti, Tushar Kanti; Surjit, Milan",bioRxiv,407,22

Also, mass group testing is not used regardless to existing shortage of tests. I propose new strategy for early detection of superspreaders with reasonable number of RT-PCR tests, which can dramatically mitigate development COVID-19 pandemic and even turn it endemic. Methods I used stochastic social-epidemiological SEIAR model, where S-suspected, E-exposed, I-infectious, A-admitted (confirmed COVID-19 positive, who are admitted to hospital or completely isolated), R-recovered. The model was applied to real COVID-19 dynamics in London, Moscow and New York City. Findings Viral loading data measured by RT-PCR were fitted by broad log-normal distribution, which governed high importance of superspreaders. The proposed full scale model of a metropolis shows that top 10% spreaders (100+ higher viral loading than median infector) transmit 45% of new cases. Rapid isolation of superspreaders leads to 4-8 fold mitigation of pandemic depending on applied quarantine strength and amount of currently infected people. High viral loading allows efficient group matrix pool testing of population focused on detection of the superspreaders requiring remarkably small amount of tests. Interpretation The model and new testing strategy may prevent thousand or millions COVID-19 deaths requiring just about 5000 daily RT-PCR test for big 12 million city such as Moscow. Though applied to COVID-19 pandemic the results are universal and can be used for other infectious heterogenous epidemics. Funding No funding","Gongalsky, Maxim B",,407,1

To ensure continued response to the epidemic is most effective, it is imperative to better understand both retrospectively and prospectively the geographical evolution of COVID-19 caseloads and deaths at small-area resolution, identify localised areas in space–time at significantly higher risk, quantify the impact of changes in localised population mobility (or movement) on caseloads, identify localised risk factors for increased mortality and project the likely course of the epidemic at high spatial resolution in coming weeks. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical space–time SEIR model to assess the spatiotemporal variability of COVID-19 caseloads (transmission) and deaths at small-area scale in England [Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA), 6791 units] and by week (using observed data from week 5 to 34 of 2020), including key determinants, the modelled transmission dynamics and spatial–temporal random effects. We also estimate the number of cases and deaths at small-area resolution with uncertainty projected forward in time by MSOA (up to week 51 of 2020), the impact mobility reductions (and subsequent easing) have had on COVID-19 caseloads and quantify the impact of key socio-demographic risk factors on COVID-19 related mortality risk by MSOA. Reductions in population mobility during the course of the first lockdown had a significant impact on the reduction of COVID-19 caseloads across England, however local authorities have had a varied rate of reduction in population movement which our model suggest has substantially impacted the geographic heterogeneity in caseloads at small-area scale. The steady gain in population mobility, observed from late April, appears to have contributed to a slowdown in caseload reductions towards late June and subsequent start of the second wave. MSOA with higher proportions of elderly (70+ years of age) and elderly living in deprivation, both with very distinct geographic distributions, have a significantly elevated COVID-19 mortality rates. While non-pharmaceutical interventions (that is, reductions in population mobility and social distancing) had a profound impact on the trajectory of the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in England, increased population mobility appears to have significantly contributed to the second wave. A number of contiguous small-areas appear to be at a significant elevated risk of high COVID-19 transmission, many of which are also at increased risk for higher mortality rates. A geographically staggered re-introduction of intensified social distancing measures is advised and limited cross MSOA movement if the magnitude and geographic extent of the second wave is to be reduced.","Sartorius, B.; Lawson, A.

There are reports of encephalitis, encephalopathy, cranial neuropathy, Guillain-Barrè syndrome, and myositis/rhabdomyolysis in patients with COVID-19. In this review, we focused on the neuromuscular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We analyzed all published reports on SARS-CoV-2-related peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction, muscle, and cranial nerve disorders. Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction is now accepted as an early manifestation of COVID-19 infection. Inflammation, edema, and axonal damage of olfactory bulb have been shown in autopsy of patients who died of COVID-19. Olfactory pathway is suggested as a portal of entry of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain. Similar to involvement of olfactory bulb, isolated oculomotor, trochlear and facial nerve has been described. Increasing reports Guillain-Barrè syndrome secondary to COVID-19 are being published. Unlike typical GBS, most of COVID-19-related GBS were elderly, had concomitant pneumonia or ARDS, more prevalent demyelinating neuropathy, and relatively poor outcome. Myalgia is described among the common symptoms of COVID-19 after fever, cough, and sore throat. Duration of myalgia may be related to the severity of COVID-19 disease. Few patients had muscle weakness and elevated creatine kinase along with elevated levels of acute-phase reactants. All these patients with myositis/rhabdomyolysis had severe respiratory complications related to COVID-19. A handful of patients with myasthenia gravis showed exacerbation of their disease after acquiring COVID-19 disease.

Alveolospheres exhibited indolent growth in a Wnt and R-spondin dependent manner. Gene expression, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy analyses revealed the presence of alveolar cells in alveolospheres. Alveolospheres expressed ACE2 and allowed SARS-CoV-2 to propagate nearly 100,000- fold in three days of infection. While lopinavir and nelfinavir, protease inhibitors used for the treatment of HIV infection, had a modest anti-viral effect on SARS-CoV-2, remdesivir, a nucleotide prodrug, showed anti-viral effect at the concentration comparable to the circulating drug level.

It has 121 amino acids with two genotypes, orf8L and orf8S. In this study, we overexpressed the orf8L and orf8S of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the orf8b of SARS-CoV to investigate their roles in the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the inhibition of interferon beta (IFNß) production. We found that the two genotypes of SARS-CoV-2 orf8 are capable of inducing ER stress without significant difference by triggering the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and inositol-requiring enzymes 1 (IRE1) branches of the ER stress pathway. However, the third branch of ER stress pathway, i.e. the protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), was unaffected by the overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 orf8L or orf8S. Moreover, both orf8L and orf8S of SARS-CoV-2 are capable of down regulating the production of IFNß and interferon-stimulated genes (ISG), ISG15 and ISG56 induced by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly (I:C)). Moreover, we also found decreased nuclear translocation of Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), after overexpressing orf8L and orf8S induced by poly (I:C). Our data demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 orf8 protein could induce ER stress by activating the ATF6 and IRE1 pathways, but not the PERK pathway, and functions as an interferon antagonist to inhibit the production of IFNß. However, these functions appeared not to be affected by the genotypes of SARS-CoV-2 orf8L and orf8S.","Rashid, Farooq; Dzakah, Emmanuel Enoch; Wang, Haiying; Tang, Shixing",Virus Res,407,32

Methods The trauma caseloads between March 25, 2020, and April 14, 2020, and that of the homologous period of 2019 were thoroughly analyzed and compared retrospectively. Results There was an overall decrease in trauma patients. Elderly male patients had an increased incidence of injury during the lockdown period with a significant p-value (0.0009). There was a significant increase in the number of minor orthopedic procedures while there was a significant decrease in the number of major orthopedic procedures. Fractures of the proximal femur were significantly increased during the lockdown period (p-value0.011) and fractures of the femur and tibia shaft were significantly decreased during the lockdown period (p-value0.002). Fractures of the distal radius were significantly increased during the lockdown period (p-value0.005) and fractures of the shaft of humerus, radius, and ulna were significantly decreased during the lockdown period (p-value0.028). Injuries following fall, trivial trauma, and animal-induced trauma were significantly increased (p-values <0.0001, <0.0001, 0.014, respectively), whereas injuries following sports and motor vehicle accidents were significantly decreased (p-value 0.006, <0.0001, respectively).

The purpose of this study is to understand the effect of current health care policies and practices on racial/ethnic groups and in particular racialized groups at the level of the individual in Toronto’s health care system. METHODS: This study used a semi-qualitative study design: concept mapping. A purposive sampling strategy was used to recruit participants. Health care users and health care providers from Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area participated in all four concept mapping activities. The sample sizes varied according to the activity. For the rating activity, 41 racialized health care users, 23 non-racialized health care users and 11 health care providers completed this activity. The data analysis was completed using the concept systems software. RESULTS: Participants generated 35 unique statements of ways in which patients feel disrespect or mistreatment when receiving health care. These statements were grouped into five clusters: ‘Racial/ethnic and class discrimination’, ‘Dehumanizing the patient’, ‘Negligent communication’, ‘Professional misconduct’, and ‘Unequal access to health and health services’. Two distinct conceptual regions were identified: ‘Viewed as inferior’ and ‘Unequal medical access’. From the rating activity, racialized health care users reported ‘race’/ethnic based discrimination or everyday racism as largely contributing to the challenges experienced when receiving health care; statements rated high for action/change include ‘when the health care provider does not complete a proper assessment’, ‘when the patient’s symptoms are ignored or not taken seriously’, ‘and ‘when the health care provider belittles or talks down to the patient’. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies how racialized health care users experience everyday racism when receiving health care and this is important to consider in the development of future research and interventions aimed at addressing institutional racism in the health care setting. To support the elimination of institutional racism, anti-racist policies are needed to move beyond cultural competence polices and towards addressing the centrality of unequal power social relations and everyday racism in the health care system.","Mahabir, Deb Finn; O’Campo, Patricia; Lofters, Aisha; Shankardass, Ketan; Salmon, Christina; Muntaner, Carles",Int J Equity Health,407,11

Chest X-ray is currently accepted to be one of the reliable means for such a detection purpose. However, most of the available methods utilize large training data, and there is a need for improvement in the detection accuracy due to the limited boundary segment of the acquired images for symptom identifications. In this study, a robust and efficient method based on transfer learning techniques is proposed to identify normal and COVID-19 patients by employing small training data. Transfer learning builds accurate models in a timesaving way. First, data augmentation was performed to help the network for memorization of image details. Next, five state-of-the-art transfer learning models, AlexNet, MobileNetv2, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and Xception, with three optimizers, Adam, SGDM, and RMSProp, were implemented at various learning rates, 1e-4, 2e-4, 3e-4, and 4e-4, to reduce the probability of overfitting. All the experiments were performed on publicly available datasets with several analytical measurements attained after execution with a 10-fold cross-validation method. The results suggest that MobileNetv2 with Adam optimizer at a learning rate of 3e-4 provides an average accuracy, recall, precision, and F-score of 97%, 96.5%, 97.5%, and 97%, respectively, which are higher than those of all other combinations.

We sought to determine the seroprevalence of LTBI and LPI in such patients and explore its relationship with country of origin or previous travel in a retrospective, single-centre observational study from 2016 to 2019. Demographic data, travel history, ongoing treatments and results of the parasitological (Strongyloides stercoralis, Trypanosoma cruzi, Echinococcus multilocularis, Entamoeba histolytica and Leishmania spp.) and TB screening were collected to calculate LPI or LTBI prevalence. Risk factors for LTBI and strongyloidiasis were analysed using Poisson regression with robust variance. Among 406 eligible patients, 24/353 (6.8%) had LTBI, 8/368 (2.2%) were positive for Strongyloides stercoralis infection, 1/32 (3.1%) was positive for Entamoeba histolytica and 1/299 (0.3%) was positive for Leishmaniasis. No cases of Trypanosoma cruzi (0/274) or Echinococcus multilocularis (0/56) infection were detected. Previous travel to or originating from high-prevalence countries was a risk factor for LTBI (PR = 3.4, CI 95%: 1.4–8.2 and 4.0, CI 95%: 1.8–8.9, respectively). The prevalence of serological Strongyloidiasis in immunosuppressed patients is lower in comparison to those without immunosuppression (PR = 0.1, CI 95%: 0.01–0.8). In conclusion, screening before immunosuppression needs to be individualized, and LTBI and LPI need to be ruled out in patients who originate from or have travelled to high-prevalence countries. The sensitivity of strongyloidiasis serology is reduced following immunosuppression, so an algorithm combining different tests or presumptive treatment should be considered.","Carnino, Luisa; Schwob, Jean-Marc; Neofytos, Dionysios; Lazo-Porras, Maria; Chappuis, François; Eperon, Gilles",Trop Med Infect Dis,407,20

Methods: We administered a survey to healthcare workers to determine risk factors associated with development of headaches (frequency, headache subtypes and duration of face‐mask wear) and the impact of headaches (sick days, headache frequency and use of abortive/preventive headache medications). Results: In the survey, 212 (47 male, 165 female) healthcare workers of mean age 31 years (range, 21–58) participated. Of the 79 (37.3%) respondents who reported face‐mask‐associated headaches, 26 (32.9%) reported headache frequency exceeding six times per month. Six (7.6%) had taken sick leave from March 2003 to June 2004 (mean 2 days; range 1–4 days) and 47 (59.5%) required use of abortive analgesics because of headache. Four (2.1%) took preventive medications for headaches during this period. Multivariate logistic regression showed that pre‐existing headaches [P = 0.041, OR = 1.97 (95% CI 1.03–3.77)] and continuous use of the N95 face‐mask exceeding 4 h [P = 0.053, OR = 1.85 (95% CI 0.99–3.43)] were associated with development of headaches. Conclusions: Healthcare providers may develop headaches following the use of the N95 face‐mask. Shorter duration of face‐mask wear may reduce the frequency and severity of these headaches.","Lim, E.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate how the language and sentiment surrounding telemedicine has evolved throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Tweets published between January 1, 2020, and April 24, 2021, containing at least one telemedicine-related and one COVID-19–related search term (“telemedicine-COVID”) were collected from the Twitter full archive search (N=351,718). A comparator sample containing only COVID-19 terms (“general-COVID”) was collected and sampled based on the daily distribution of telemedicine-COVID tweets. In addition to analyses of retweets and favorites, sentiment analysis was performed on both data sets in aggregate and within a subset of tweets receiving the top 100 most and least retweets. RESULTS: Telemedicine gained prominence during the early stages of the pandemic (ie, March through May 2020) before leveling off and reaching a steady state from June 2020 onward. Telemedicine-COVID tweets had a 21% lower average number of retweets than general-COVID tweets (incidence rate ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.63-0.99; P=.04), but there was no difference in favorites. A majority of telemedicine-COVID tweets (180,295/351,718, 51.3%) were characterized as “positive,” compared to only 38.5% (135,434/351,401) of general-COVID tweets (P<.001). This trend was also true on a monthly level from March 2020 through April 2021. The most retweeted posts in both telemedicine-COVID and general-COVID data sets were authored by journalists and politicians. Whereas the majority of the most retweeted posts within the telemedicine-COVID data set were positive (55/101, 54.5%), a plurality of the most retweeted posts within the general-COVID data set were negative (44/89, 49.4%; P=.01). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, opinions surrounding telemedicine evolved to become more positive, especially when compared to the larger pool of COVID-19–related tweets. Decision makers should capitalize on these shifting public opinions to invest in telemedicine infrastructure and ensure its accessibility and success in a postpandemic world.","Pollack, Catherine C; Gilbert-Diamond, Diane; Alford-Teaster, Jennifer A; Onega, Tracy",J Med Internet Res,407,8

Methods: Sixteen pigs were divided into a 7 d group and 14 d group, each of which was further subdivided into an MSC-treated group and a control group. Five anastomoses per animal were established using LigaSure ForceTriad (Covidien, MA, USA), a tissue sealing system. Cell migration and tissue-specific differentiation potency, in addition to potential cytokine and genetic changes, were investigated. Results: There were no significant between-group differences in postoperative complications and anastomosis burst pressure. The number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen- (PCNA-) positive cells was significantly higher in the MSC-treated group as compared with that in the control group (P = 0.021). Labeled MSCs were found in the mucosal layer, villus, and lamina propria, as well as in the lamina muscularis mucosae, where they exhibited characteristics of smooth muscle cells. Conclusions: Grafted MSCs significantly promoted epithelial and connective cell proliferation and maintained their cell migration capacity and differentiation potential in the fused anastomotic tissues, without causing severe postoperative complications.","Pan, Hong; Lam, Ping Keun; Tong, See W; Leung, Kevin K; Teoh, Anthony Y; Ng, Enders K",Stem Cells Int,407,19

This case report depicts an unexpected intraoperative coagulopathy during a cesarean section in an otherwise asymptomatic patient who was later found to have COVID-19. This case suggests that there may be a higher risk for intrapartum bleeding in the pregnant, largely asymptomatic COVID-positive patient with more abnormal COVID laboratory values. CASE: The case patient displayed D-Dimer elevations beyond what is typically observed among this hospital’s COVID-positive peripartum population and displayed significantly more oozing than expected intraoperatively, despite normal prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, fibrinogen, and platelets. CONCLUSION: There is little published evidence on the association between D-Dimer and coagulopathy among the pregnant population infected with SARS-CoV-2. This case report contributes to the growing body of evidence on the effects of COVID-19 in pregnancy. A clinical picture concerning for intraoperative coagulopathy may be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection during cesarean sections, and abnormal COVID laboratory tests, particularly D-Dimer, may help identify the patients in which this presentation occurs.","Kinsey, Kelly Elizabeth; Ganz, Eric; Khalil, Susan; Brustman, Lois",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,407,1

Very recently, studies have reported its use as a basic component for the production of personal protective equipment (PPE) required for the prevention of Sars-Cov-2 contamination, responsible for the cause of coronavirus disease, which is currently a major worldwide sanitary and social problem. PLA is considered a non-toxic, biodegradable and compostable plastic with interesting characteristics from the industrial point of view, and it emerges as a promising product under the concept of ""green plastic"", since most of the polymers produced currently are petroleum-based, a non-renewable raw material. Biotechnology routes have been mentioned as potential methodologies for the production of this polymer, especially by enzymatic routes, in particular by use of lipases enzymes. The availability of pure lactic acid isomers is a fundamental aspect of the manufacture of PLA with more interesting mechanical and thermal properties. Due to the technological importance that PLA-based polymers are acquiring, as well as their characteristics and applicability in several fields, especially medical, pharmaceutical and biotechnology, this review article sought to gather very recent information regarding the development of research in this area. The main highlight of this study is that it was carried out from a biotechnological point of view, aiming at a totally green bioplastic production, since the obtaining of lactic acid, which will be used as raw material for the PLA synthesis, until the degradation of the polymer obtained by biological routes.","de Albuquerque, Tiago Lima; Marques Júnior, José Edvan; de Queiroz, Lívia Pinheiro; Ricardo, Anderson Diógenes Souza; Rocha, Maria Valderez Ponte",International journal of biological macromolecules,407,5

After autoproteolytic cleavage, the CHIKV capsid protein (CP) is involved in RNA binding and assembly of the viral particle. The monomeric CP is approximately 30 kDa in size and is small enough for passive transport through nuclear pores. Some alphaviruses are found to harbor nuclear localization signals (NLS) and transport of these proteins between cellular compartments was shown to be energy dependent. The active nuclear import of cytoplasmic proteins is mediated by karyopherins and their export by exportins. As nuclear and cytoplasmic trafficking may play a role in the life cycle of CHIKV, we have sought to identify nuclear localization and nuclear export signals in CHIKV CP in a virus-free system. METHODS: EGFP-fusion proteins of CHIKV CP and mutants thereof were created and used to monitor their intracellular localization. Binding of cellular proteins was confirmed in pull-down assays with purified CP using co-immuoprecipitation. Nuclear localization was demonstrated in a virus-free system using fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Here we show that CHIKV CP is a nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling protein with an active NLS that binds to karyopherin α (Karα) for its nuclear translocation. We also found that the Karα4 C-terminal NLS binding site is sufficient for this interaction. We further demonstrate that CHIKV CP interacts directly with the export receptor CRM1 to transport this viral protein out of the nucleus via a nuclear export signal (NES). The CHIKV CP NES was mapped between amino acids 143 and 155 of CP. Deduced from in silico analyses we found that the NES has a mode of binding similar to the snurportin-1 CRM1 complex. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to show that in a virus-free system that the CHIKV capsid protein contains both, a NLS and a NES, and that it is actively transported between the cytoplasma and the nucleus. We conclude that CHIKV CP has the ability to shuttle via interaction with karyopherins for its nuclear import and, vice versa, by CRM1-dependent nuclear export.","Thomas, Saijo; Rai, Jagdish; John, Lijo; Schaefer, Stephan; Pützer, Brigitte M; Herchenröder, Ottmar",Virol J,407,26

All hospitalized patients with confirmed and suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection between 16 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. COVID-19 patients were separated into two groups, pneumonia and nonpneumonia, and then compared to determine predicting factors for COVID-19 pneumonia. Variables that had a P-value of less than 0.20 and were not correlated with each other were included in the logistic regression model. RESULTS: Of the 247 patients included in the study 58% were female, and the median age was 40. COVID-19 was confirmed in 70.9% of these patients. Among the confirmed COVID-19 cases, 21.4% had pneumonia. In the multivariate analysis male sex (P = 0.028), hypertension (P = 0.022), and shortness of breath on hospital admission (P = 0.025) were significant factors predicting COVID-19 pneumonia.

Based on their docking scores, top three molecules (Barrigenol, Kaempferol, and Myricetin) were selected and their conformational behavior was analyzed via molecular dynamics simulations and MMPBSA calculations. The results indicated that the protein had well adapted the ligands in the binding pocket thereby forming stable complexes. These molecules displayed low binding energy during MMPBSA calculations, substantiating their strong association with Nsp15. The inhibitory potential of these molecules could further be examined by in-vivo and in-vitro investigations to validate their use as inhibitors against Nsp15 of SARS-CoV2.","Sharma, Jatin; Kumar Bhardwaj, Vijay; Singh, Rahul; Rajendran, Vidya; Purohit, Rituraj; Kumar, Sanjay",Food Chem,407,16

How best to specify (identify and define) process improvements – the changes that need to be made in a healthcare process – remains a key question. Methods for doing so collaboratively, rapidly and remotely offer much potential, but are under-developed. We propose an approach for engaging diverse stakeholders remotely in a consensus-building exercise to help specify improvements in a healthcare process, and we illustrate the approach in a case study. METHODS: Organised in a five-step framework, our proposed approach is informed by a participatory ethos, crowdsourcing and consensus-building methods: (1) define scope and objective of the process improvement; (2) produce a draft or prototype of the proposed process improvement specification; (3) identify participant recruitment strategy; (4) design and conduct a remote consensus-building exercise; (5) produce a final specification of the process improvement in light of learning from the exercise. We tested the approach in a case study that sought to specify process improvements for the management of obstetric emergencies during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a brief video showing a process for managing a post-partum haemorrhage in women with COVID-19 to elicit recommendations on how the process could be improved. Two Delphi rounds were then conducted to reach consensus. RESULTS: We gathered views from 105 participants, with a background in maternity care (n = 36), infection prevention and control (n = 17), or human factors (n = 52). The participants initially generated 818 recommendations for how to improve the process illustrated in the video, which we synthesised into a set of 22 recommendations. The consensus-building exercise yielded a final set of 16 recommendations. These were used to inform the specification of process improvements for managing the obstetric emergency and develop supporting resources, including an updated video. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed methodological approach enabled the expertise and ingenuity of diverse stakeholders to be captured and mobilised to specify process improvements in an area of pressing service need. This approach has the potential to address current challenges in process improvement, but will require further evaluation.

In the present study, a thermoanalytical approach previously developed for quantifying trace levels of polymorphic impurity (form II metastable nuclei) in commercial salmeterol xinafoate powders has been successfully applied with slight modifications to ribavirin, an antiviral drug exhibiting roughly similar polymorph-dependent crystallization kinetics in melts to that of salmeterol xinafoate. Essentially, the approach involved modeling of the crystallization kinetics of both tested and reference drug materials in melts using the Avrami-Erofe’ev (AE) rate expression, derivation of a mathematical equation for relating the AE kinetic constant to the composition of reference polymorph mixtures, and the use of this derived equation (in the form of a calibration curve) to calculate the impurity contents of the tested samples from their computed AE constants. For ribavirin, modification of the latter equation by incorporation of an empirical exponent was found necessary to account for the composition-dependent changes in crystallization kinetics of the reference mixtures. Such modification has made possible the determination of polymorphic impurity content of as low as 0.004% (w/w) in ribavirin samples induced by different forms of grinding treatment.","Tong, Henry H.Y.; Shekunov, Boris Y.; Chan, John P.; Mok, Cedric K.F.; Hung, Henry C.M.; Chow, Albert H.L.",Int J Pharm,407,28

Methods An anonymous 38-question cross-sectional survey was developed using Qualtrics and emailed to all staff physicians from all specialty disciplines at the Mayo Clinic Florida. The survey was open from August 17, 2020 through September 1, 2020. Collected data included general demographics and employment information, attitude and experience with telemedicine use before and during COVID-19, perception of patients’ experience, and the effect of telemedicine on burnout. Results The survey was distributed to 529 eligible physicians at our institution, with 103 physicians responding (19.5%). The distribution of specialties was 22.3% primary care specialties, 40.8% other internal medicine subspecialties, and 17.5% surgical specialties. Collectively, 63% found comparable quality of care when provided virtually (vs. in-person), while 80% perceived telemedicine as cost-effective. A total of 76% of physicians felt that telemedicine increased flexibility and control over patient-care activities, with 36% reporting improved work-life balance and 30% reporting improved burnout symptoms. Overall, 42% preferred using telemedicine over in-person visits when possible. Conclusions Physicians generally held positive attitudes regarding the adoption of telemedicine, and perceived that the quality of healthcare delivery as generally comparable to in-person care.

Although SARS-CoV-2 surveillance has been applied in more than 50 countries to date, the application of this surveillance has been largely focused on relatively affluent urban and peri-urban communities. As such, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the implementation of reliable wastewater surveillance in small and rural communities for the purpose of tracking rates of incidence of COVID-19 and other pathogens or biomarkers. This study examines the correlations between SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal from wastewater samples harvested from the access port at a lagoon (waste-stabilization pond), a wastewater pumping station and the regional COVID-19 rate of incidence (measured as percent test positivity) in a small, rural community in Ontario, Canada. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) targeting the N1 and N2 genes of SARS-CoV-2 of lagoon samples demonstrate that 80% of 24-hr composite samples collected across a period of 5.5 weeks were below the limit of quantification (5 gene copies/microliter). However, 100% of the 24-hr composite samples collected on the same days from the upstream pumping station were capable of not only yielding strong viral signal but once normalized for PMMoV, also predicted the increase in viral signal approximately 10-14 days prior to an increase in community's COVID-19 reported test percent positivity. RNA concentration and integrity of samples harvested from the lagoon was both lower and more variable than from RNA harvested from the upstream pumping station that were collected on the same date, indicating a higher overall stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and hence a stronger viral signal that correlates to community incidence of COVID-19. In sewered small and rural communities operating wastewater lagoons, WBE samples should therefore be harvested from pumping stations or the sewershed as opposed to lagoons.","D'Aoust, P.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 95 patients who underwent PAE with adjunctive bilateral coil embolization of the PAs following particle embolization between September 2018 and May 2021 were included. The patients had a mean prostate size of 115 ± 64 ml, 18/95 with hematuria symptoms, and 16/95 with indwelling urinary catheters. Coil embolization was performed in the main PAs prior to the bifurcation into the anteromedial and posterolateral branches using detachable microcoils. International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS), quality of life (QOL), maximum flow rate (Qmax) and adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: IPSS were improved by − 11.2 ± 7.9 (n = 49, P < 0.001) and QOL by − 2.4 ± 1.8 (n = 49, P < 0.001) over a mean follow-up of 10.7 ± 7.9 weeks. Qmax did not demonstrate statistical significance. Twelve patients with hematuria (67%) showed improvement or resolution and twelve patients with indwelling or intermittent catheters (75%) were no longer catheter dependent. Two patients underwent a repeat PAE. There were no adverse events which were attributable to coil embolization. CONCLUSION: Adjunctive coil embolization of the main PAs following particle embolization is a technically feasible technique with similar short-term clinical outcomes compared to prior studies. This novel technique warrants further prospective investigation with controls.","Galla, Naveen; Maron, Samuel Z.; Voutsinas, Nicholas; Sher, Alex; Tangel, Matthew; Jue, Joshua S.; Sharma, Himanshu; Lookstein, Robert A.; Fischman, Aaron M.; Rastinehad, Ardeshir R.",Cardiovasc Intervent Radiol,407,1

Thus, far, fly ash has received much attention but less attention has been paid to bottom ash. In this study, bottom ash samples were collected from a typical MW incinerator, and typical pollutants including heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the ash were examined. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy results indicated that CaO, SiO(2) and Al(2)O(3) were the main components of the bottom ash. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy showed that the ash contained large amounts of heavy metals, including Zn, Ti, Ba, Cu, Pb, Mn, Cr, Ni and Sn. Most of the heavy metals (e.g., Ba, Cr, Ni, and Sn) presented in the residual fraction; whereas Mn, Pb and Zn presented in Fe–Mn oxides fraction, and Cu in organic-matter fraction. Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure tests indicated that the leached amounts of heavy metals were well below the limits. The sum of 16 US EPA priority PAHs (ΣPAHs) varied from 10.30 to 38.14 mg kg(−1), and the total amounts of carcinogenic PAHs ranged between 4.09 and 16.95 mg kg(−1), exceeding the limits regulated by several countries.

ACE-2 expressing respiratory system involvement is the main clinical manifestation of the infection. However, literature about the association between the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and higher ACE-2 expressing kidney is very limited. In this study, we primarily aimed to investigate whether there is a kidney injury during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The predictive value of kidney injury for survival was also determined. Methods: A total of 47 participants who met the inclusion criteria were included in the study. The participants were classified as COVID-19 patients before treatment, COVID-19 patients after treatment, COVID-19 patients under treatment in ICU and controls. The parameters comorbidity, serum creatinine and cystatin C levels, CKD-EPI eGFR levels, KIM-1 and NGAL levels, urine KIM-1/creatinine and NGAL/creatinine ratios were statistically compared between the groups. The associations between covariates including kidney disease indicators and death from COVID-19 were examined using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. Results: Serum creatinine and cystatin C levels, urine KIM-1/creatinine levels, and CKD-EPI, CKD-EPI cystatin C and CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C eGFR levels exhibited significant difference in the groups. The causes of the difference were more altered kidney function and increased acute kidney damage in COVID-19 patients before treatment and under treatment in ICU. Additionally, incidences of comorbidity and proteinuria in the urine analysis were higher in the COVID-19 patients under treatment in ICU group. Urine KIM-1/creatinine ratio and proteinuria were associated with COVID-19 specific death. Conclusions: We found that COVID-19 patients under treatment in ICU exhibited extremely higher levels of serum cystatin C, and urine KIM-1/creatinine and urine NGAL/creatinine ratios. These results clearly described the acute kidney damage by COVID-19 using molecular kidney damage markers for the first time in the literature. Lowered CKD-EPI, CKD-EPI cystatin C and CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C eGFR levels were determined in them, as well. Urine KIM-1/creatinine ratio and proteinuria were associated with COVID-19 specific death. In this regard, considering kidney function and kidney damage markers must not be ignored in the COVID-19 patients, and serial monitoring of them should be considered.","Temiz, M.

Similarly to other bacterial and viral infections, dysregulation of the immune system due to post-infectious mechanisms, such as the molecular mimicry, could lead to an indirect damage of the peripheral nervous system related to SARS-CoV-2. GBS causes motor dysfunctions that are not easily recognizable in non-neurological settings or in patients requiring ventilatory assistance. Several reports also suggested that GBS and Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) could be neurological complications of COVID-19. Therefore, we performed a review of the 29 articles so far published, describing 33 GBS cases and five MFS cases associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We recommend awareness of this rare, but treatable, neurological syndrome, which may also determine a sudden and otherwise unexplained respiratory deterioration in COVID-19 patients.","Zito, Antonio; Alfonsi, Enrico; Franciotta, Diego; Todisco, Massimiliano; Gastaldi, Matteo; Cotta Ramusino, Matteo; Ceroni, Mauro; Costa, Alfredo",Front Neurol,407,24

Leveraging data from 68,000 full sequence tests of BRCA1 and BRCA2, plus data from the limited number of already classified BRCA1 RING domain missense substitutions, we used logistic regression and related techniques to evaluate three BRCA1 RING domain assays. These were recently described high throughput yeast 2-hybrid and E3 ubiquitin ligase assays, plus a newly developed mammalian 2-hybrid assay. While there were concerns about the accuracy of the yeast 2-hybrid assay and the indirect nature of the ubiquitin ligase assay, the mammalian 2-hybrid assay had excellent correlation with existing missense substitution classifications. After calibration, this assay contributed to classification of one newly reported BRCA1 missense substitution. In principal, the mammalian 2-hybrid assay could be converted to a high-throughput format that would likely retain suitable accuracy. Part 2 How does one achieve clinically applicable classification of the vast majority of all possible sequence variants in disease susceptibility genes? BRCA1 is a high-risk susceptibility gene for breast and ovarian cancer. Pathogenic protein truncating variants are scattered across the open reading frame, but all known missense substitutions that are pathogenic because of missense dysfunction are located in either the amino-terminal RING domain or the carboxy-terminal BRCT domain. Heterodimerization of the BRCA1 and BARD1 RING domains is a molecularly defined obligate activity. Hence, we tested every BRCA1 RING domain missense substitution that can be created by a single nucleotide change for heterodimerization with BARD1 in a Mammalian 2-hybrid (M2H) assay. Downstream of the M2H laboratory assay, we addressed three additional challenges: assay calibration, validation thereof, and integration of the calibrated results with other available data such as computational evidence and patient/population observational data to achieve clinically applicable classification. Overall, we found that about 20% of BRCA1 RING domain missense substitutions are pathogenic. Using a Bayesian point system for data integration and variant classification, we achieved clinical classification of about 89% of observed missense substitutions. Moreover, among missense substitutions not present in the human observational data used here, we find an additional 47 with concordant computational and functional assay evidence in favor of pathogenicity; these are particularly likely to be classified as Likely Pathogenic once human observational data become available.","Paquette, Andrew; Tao, Kayoko; Clark, Kathleen A; Stark, Alex W; Rosenthal, Judith; Snow, Angela K; Bell, Russell; Thompson, Bryony A; Unger, Joshua; Milash, Brett A; Pappas, Lisa; Gertz, Jason; Varley, Katherine E; Thomas, Alun; Boucher, Ken; Foulkes, William D; Goldgar, David E; Tavtigian, Sean V",bioRxiv,407,3

Little is known about patients’ experiences of these discussions. OBJECTIVE: This study explored patients’ perspectives of the GOC discussion in the hospital setting. DESIGN: An explorative qualitative design was used within a social constructionist framework. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients were recruited from six Australian hospitals across two states. Eligible patients had had a GOC discussion and they were identified by the senior nurse or their doctor for informed consent and interview. APPROACH: Semi-structured individual or dyadic interviews (with the carer/family member present) were conducted at the bedside or at the patient’s home (for recently discharged patients). Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed for themes. KEY RESULTS: Thirty-eight patient interviews were completed. The key themes identified were (1) values and expectations, and (2) communication (sub-themes: (i) facilitators of the conversation, (ii) barriers to the conversation, and (iii) influence of the environment). Most patients viewed the conversation as necessary and valued having their preferences heard. Effective communication strategies and a safe, private setting were facilitators of the GOC discussion. Deficits in any of these key elements functioned as a barrier to the process. CONCLUSIONS: Effective communication, and patients’ values and expectations set the stage for goals of care discussions; however, the environment plays a significant role. Communication skills training and education designed to equip clinicians to negotiate GOC interactions effectively are essential. These interventions must also be accompanied by systemic changes including building a culture supportive of GOC, clear policies and guidelines, and champions who facilitate uptake of GOC discussions.

Data included sociodemographic and clinical information and the DASS-21 and IES questionnaires. We analysed 21 207 responses using the appropriate descriptive and univariate tests as well as binary logistic regression to identify psychological risk and protective factors. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant gradient in the psychological impact experienced in five domains according to mental status, with the NMD group being the least affected and the CMD group being the most affected.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly pathogenic, but is unique from other viral infections in that pediatric patients are largely spared from severe symptoms. However, a small number of pediatric patients present autoimmune-like symptoms after COVID-19 infection, termed Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, or MIS-C. Symptomatically, it shares some similarity to that of Kawasaki's Disease (KD), an autoimmune disorder linked to coronavirus infection thought to be driven by autoantibody production. Understanding the immunological mechanisms that facilitate clearance of SARS-CoV-2 or drive the development of life-threatening autoimmune symptoms in MIS-C or KD is critical for our ability to design successful vaccines that do not elicit autoimmunity in children. Antibodies are produced by terminally differentiated B lymphocytes known as Plasma Cells (PC). Because successful immune responses/vaccination strategies against SARS-CoV-2 are dependent upon effective PC production, the dysregulation of which may lead to the development of Kawasaki's Disease or MIS-C, it is critical to understand the immunological mechanisms that define the pediatric PC response leading to these individual outcomes. We therefore sought to characterize the B cell-PC immune response in pediatric patients that have successfully cleared SARS-CoV-2 and compare the B cell immunological landscape to children who develop either KD or MIS-C. We used the 10X Genomics Platform to interrogate at a single cell level the CD19+ B/PC populations in the peripheral blood of pediatric patients at the transcriptional level as well as with VDJ deep sequencing. We began by clustering the CD19+ populations based on transcriptional similarity and found that both COVID-19 and KD exhibited 12 distinct clusters, but that MIS-C only had 6 clusters. Intriguingly, in evaluating clonal diversity, KD presented a broad spectrum of clonotypes while the COVID-19 and MISC patients were much more limited. This suggested that although KD and MIS-C both present with similar autoimmune-like symptoms, the mechanistic basis for their respective etiology may be distinct. We therefore sought to more deeply probe the subset of cells responsible for antibody production by evaluating the PC subsets. High BLIMP1 expression (PC lineage-defining transcription factor) was present in 2 distinct clusters in COVID-19/KD patients, but was broadly distributed at lower levels in MIS-C. We then looked at genes which were significantly upregulated in the most terminally differentiated cells from each patient. 50 genes were significantly higher in the COVID-19 and KD populations, and 54 in MIS-C. Using gene ontology analysis in COVID-19 and KD, we saw increased expression of transcripts involved in protein trafficking, redox responses, and respiratory metabolism. In comparison, the MIS-C patient demonstrated significance for programs involved in immature B cell development and inflammation. Taken together, this suggests that in COVID-19 and KD there is a program of terminal PC differentiation which is absent in MIS-C. To understand the mechanistic basis for the terminal differentiation in COVID-19 and KD, we sought to probe possible regulators of PC fate. We have recently published that CD28, the canonical T cell costimulatory molecule, is expressed by PC, and CD28 signaling through the adaptor protein SLP-76 leads to increased BLIMP1 expression and an IRF4-mediated metabolic program necessary for PC survival. Interestingly, SLP-76 was expressed at high levels in COVID-19 and KD patients, but was low in MIS-C. Similarly, CD28 was expressed in both COVID-19 and KD patients and correlated with higher IRF4 levels and metabolic genes, but was entirely absent in MIS-C. Taken together, these findings suggest that CD28 signaling may facilitate PC fate in COVID-19 pediatric patients and the development of KD arises from broad antibody specificity, possibly explaining how vascular antigens become targets. Furthermore, MIS-C, although similar in symptomatic presentation to KD, has an etiology driven by antigen-independent inflammation arising from immature B cells due to a lack of CD28-mediated PC differentiation and survival, which can be evaluated diagnostically by simple flow cytometry in a vaccination setting.

Clinical data on MERS-CoV infections are scarce. We report epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of 47 cases of MERS-CoV infections, identify knowledge gaps, and define research priorities. METHODS: We abstracted and analysed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from confirmed cases of sporadic, household, community, and health-care-associated MERS-CoV infections reported from Saudi Arabia between Sept 1, 2012, and June 15, 2013. Cases were confirmed as having MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR. FINDINGS: 47 individuals (46 adults, one child) with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV disease were identified; 36 (77%) were male (male:female ratio 3·3:1). 28 patients died, a 60% case-fatality rate. The case-fatality rate rose with increasing age. Only two of the 47 cases were previously healthy; most patients (45 [96%]) had underlying comorbid medical disorders, including diabetes (32 [68%]), hypertension (16 [34%]), chronic cardiac disease (13 [28%]), and chronic renal disease (23 [49%]). Common symptoms at presentation were fever (46 [98%]), fever with chills or rigors (41 [87%]), cough (39 [83%]), shortness of breath (34 [72%]), and myalgia (15 [32%]). Gastrointestinal symptoms were also frequent, including diarrhoea (12 [26%]), vomiting (ten [21%]), and abdominal pain (eight [17%]). All patients had abnormal findings on chest radiography, ranging from subtle to extensive unilateral and bilateral abnormalities. Laboratory analyses showed raised concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (23 [49%]) and aspartate aminotransferase (seven [15%]) and thrombocytopenia (17 [36%]) and lymphopenia (16 [34%]). INTERPRETATION: Disease caused by MERS-CoV presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations and is associated with substantial mortality in admitted patients who have medical comorbidities. Major gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology, community prevalence, and clinical spectrum of infection and disease need urgent definition.

The effect of these interventions on access to primary and specialist care services is not well-defined. This study assesses the long-term effects of an HF intervention for homeless adults with mental illness on primary care physician (PCP) and non-primary care physician (non-PCP) visits. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of the At Home/Chez Soi study, a randomized trial of HF for homeless adults with mental illness in Toronto, Canada. High-need (HN) participants were randomized to HF with assertive community treatment (HF-ACT) or treatment as usual (TAU). Moderate needs (MN) participants were randomized to HF with intensive case management (HF-ICM) or TAU. The primary outcomes were the incidence and the number of visits to a PCP and non-PCP over 7-years post-randomization, compared to the 1-year pre-randomization. RESULTS: Of 575 enrolled participants, 527 (80 HN and 347 MN) participants were included in the analyses. HN participants who received HF-ACT had a significant reduction in the number of visits to a PCP compared to TAU participants (ratio of rate ratios (RRR): 0.66, 95% CI: 0.48-0.93) and a significant reduction in the number of non-PCP visits compared with TAU participants (RRR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.42-0.97) in the 7-years post-randomization compared to the 1-year pre-randomization. MN participants who received HF-ICM had a significant increase in incident visits to a PCP compared to TAU participants (RRR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.10-2.50). No effect of HF-ICM was observed on the incidence or number of non-PCP visits. CONCLUSION: HF has differing effects on visits to PCPs and non-PCPs among homeless people with high and moderate needs for mental health supports. HF does not result in a consistent increase in PCP and non-PCP visits over a 7-year follow-up period. The At Home/Chez Soi study is registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN, ISRCTN42520374).","Mejia-Lancheros, Cilia; Lachaud, James; To, Matthew J.; Lee, Patsy; Nisenbaum, Rosane; O’Campo, Patricia; Stergiopoulos, Vicky; Hwang, Stephen W.",J Prim Care Community Health,407,32

How do societies know when an epidemic is over and normal life can resume? What criteria and markers indicate such an end? Who has the insight, authority, and credibility to decipher these signs? Detailed research on past epidemics has demonstrated that they do not end suddenly; indeed, only rarely do the diseases in question actually end. This article examines the ways in which scholars have identified and described the end stages of previous epidemics, pointing out that significantly less attention has been paid to these periods than to origins and climaxes. Analysis of the ends of epidemics illustrates that epidemics are as much social, political, and economic events as they are biological; the “end,” therefore, is as much a process of social and political negotiation as it is biomedical. Equally important, epidemics end at different times for different groups, both within one society and across regions. Multidisciplinary research into how epidemics end reveals how the end of an epidemic shifts according to perspective, whether temporal, geographic, or methodological. A multidisciplinary analysis of how epidemics end suggests that epidemics should therefore be framed not as linear narratives—from outbreak to intervention to termination—but within cycles of disease and with a multiplicity of endings.","Charters, Erica; Heitman, Kristin",Centaurus,407,24

Since the patient refused admission to the hospital and had stable vital signs, we chose to treat him with a safe anti-inflammatory and non-immunosuppressive therapy. To hit two birds with one stone, we considered colchicine, as it has systemic anti-inflammatory effects and is also effective in gout flare. Unexpectedly, 48 hours after treatment, not only did his ongoing fever and toe pain disappear, he also had significant improvements in his general state of health and all his inflammatory markers including fibrinogen, ferritin, D-dimer, and IL-6 levels normalized. To our knowledge, the use of colchicine in Covid-19 and CRS has not been reported. This observation merits the consideration of colchicine as a safe, inexpensive and oral medication for the treatment of mild to moderate CRS in Covid-19 patients. More importantly, in Covid-19 patients with early lung involvement colchicine may be an appropriate candidate to prevent CRS in adjunction with routine antiviral agents.

These differences arise because viruses are subject to unique mutation and selection pressures that do not apply to host genomes; however, the molecular mechanisms that underlie these evolutionary forces are unclear. Here, we analyzed the patterns of codon usage in 1,520 vertebrate-infecting viruses, focusing on parameters known to be under selection and associated with gene regulation. We find that GC content, dinucleotide content, and splicing and m(6)A modification-related sequence motifs are associated with the type of genetic material (DNA or RNA), strandedness, and replication compartment of viruses. In an experimental follow-up, we find that the effects of GC content on gene expression depend on whether the genetic material is delivered to the cell as DNA or mRNA, whether it is transcribed by endogenous or exogenous RNA polymerase, and whether transcription takes place in the nucleus or cytoplasm. Our results suggest that viral codon usage cannot be explained by a simple adaptation to the codon usage of the host—instead, it reflects the combination of multiple selective and mutational pressures, including the need for efficient transcription, export, and immune evasion.","Mordstein, Christine; Cano, Laura; Morales, Atahualpa Castillo; Young, Bethan; Ho, Alexander T; Rice, Alan M; Liss, Michael; Hurst, Laurence D; Kudla, Grzegorz",Genome Biol Evol,407,21

The former is associated with Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) severity. We aimed to investigate whether an association also exists for EAT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively measured EAT volume using computed tomography (CT) scans (semi-automatic software) of inpatients with COVID-19 and analyzed the correlation between EAT volume and anthropometric characteristics and comorbidities. We then analyzed the clinicobiological and radiological parameters associated with severe COVID-19 (O2 [Formula: see text] 6 l/min), intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death, and 25% or more CT lung involvement, which are three key indicators of COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: We included 100 consecutive patients; 63% were men, mean age was 61.8 ± 16.2 years, 47% were obese, 54% had hypertension, 42% diabetes, and 17.2% a cardiovascular event history. Severe COVID-19 (n = 35, 35%) was associated with EAT volume (132 ± 62 vs 104 ± 40 cm(3), p = 0.02), age, ferritinemia, and 25% or more CT lung involvement. ICU admission or death (n = 14, 14%) was associated with EAT volume (153 ± 67 vs 108 ± 45 cm(3), p = 0.015), hypertension and 25% or more CT lung involvement. The association between EAT volume and severe COVID-19 remained after adjustment for sex, BMI, ferritinemia and lung involvement, but not after adjustment for age. Instead, the association between EAT volume and ICU admission or death remained after adjustment for all five of these parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that measuring EAT volume on chest CT scans at hospital admission in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 might help to assess the risk of disease aggravation.","Bihan, Hélène; Heidar, Richard; Beloeuvre, Aude; Allard, Lucie; Ouedraogo, Elise; Tatulashvili, Sopio; Tandjaoui, Yacine; Gaudry, Stephane; Brillet, Pierre-Yves; Cosson, Emmanuel",Cardiovasc Diabetol,407,23

METHODS: The research was a cross‐sectional study of 271 students from two public schools in Jeddah City, Saudi Arabia. An eighteen-item questionnaire was used for this purpose. Those who completed the baseline questionnaire were allocated to one of two groups: (1) mobile application and (2) educational lecture. A follow-up survey was later conducted at three months, which repeated eight of the eighteen questions asked in the baseline survey. The change in oral hygiene attitude and behaviors was compared across both groups. RESULTS: The Brush DJ app was found to be equally effective compared to educational lectures in changing oral health knowledge, attitude and behavior. Both groups showed significant improvements in almost all aspects of oral health, except for the frequency and duration of tooth brushing in the app group. There was no change in twice daily tooth brushing of app users, and less than 40% reported brushing their teeth for 2 minutes. A statistically significant change, however, was noted among lecture group participants in these two areas of oral hygiene routine. The app was also found to be more difficult in usability than educational lectures (p = 0.037).

Early investment in effective prevention would generally reduce the morbidity, complication, functional disability, and mortality of most chronic illnesses and save resources in both healthcare and social services. This research aims to investigate how the optimal allocation of medical resources between prevention and treatment adds value to the population’s health as well as examine the interaction between ageing, health, and economic performance. METHODS: This research undertakes ageing-health analyses by developing an economic growth model. Based on the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) countries’ experiences over the period from 2000 to 2017, this research further examines the hypothesis that an ageing society could increase demand for preventive and curative healthcare. RESULTS: Theoretical analysis found that the prevention share for maximizing growth is the same as that for minimizing ill health and maximizing welfare; this share increases with treatment share and ageing ratios. Estimation results from OECD countries’ experiences indicate that when treatment share increases by 1%, the prevention demand increases by 0.036%. A one-percent increase in the ageing ratio yields a change in prevention share of 0.0368%. The optimal share of prevention health expenditure to GDP would be 1.175% when the prevalence rate of ill health isat 6.13%; a higher or lower share of prevention would be accompanied with a higher prevalence of ill health. For example, a zero and 1.358% preventive health expenditure would be associated with an 18.01% prevalence of ill health, while the current share of prevention of 0.237% is associated with a 10.26% prevalence of ill health. CONCLUSION: This study shows that appropriate prevention is associated with decreases in the prevalence rates of ill health, which in turn attains sustainable growth in productivity. Too much prevention, however, could lead to higher detection of new chronic diseases with mild severity, which would result in longer illness duration, and higher prevalence rates of ill health. With suitable allocation of medical resources, the economic growth rate will help to cancel out increases in healthcare spending for the elderly and for expenses needed for the improvement of the population’s health as a whole.","Wang, Fuhmei; Wang, Jung-Der",Health Econ Rev,407,26

This study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary care Spanish hospital with an active ongoing antimicrobial stewardship programme (ASP). For a 20-week period, we weekly assessed antimicrobial consumption, incidence density, and crude death rate per 1000 occupied bed days of candidemia and multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial bloodstream infections (BSI). We conducted a segmented regression analysis of time series. Antimicrobial consumption increased +3.5% per week (p = 0.016) for six weeks after the national lockdown, followed by a sustained weekly reduction of −6.4% (p = 0.001). The global trend for the whole period was stable. The frequency of empirical treatment of patients with COVID-19 was 33.7%. No change in the global trend of incidence of hospital-acquired candidemia and MDR bacterial BSI was observed (+0.5% weekly; p = 0.816), nor differences in 14 and 30-day crude death rates (p = 0.653 and p = 0.732, respectively).

METHOD: Prevalence study. The presence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was determined in HCP of the HD. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) tests were used. Field work took place from April 24, 2020 to May 8, 2020. The age, sex, occupation (physician, nurse, etc.) and the work area (Primary Care, Emergency Room, etc.) were gathered. The IgG antibody prevalence was then calculated with its 95% confidence interval (95% CI). To study the association between HCP characteristics and the presence IgG the Chi Square test was used, and to study the magnitude of association, the Odds Ratio (95% CI) was calculated. RESULTS: Of the 4813 HCP in the HD, 4179 (87,1%) participated. Of these, 73,3% (3065) were women and 26,7% (1114) men. The global prevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was 6,6% (95% CI: 5,8–7,3). There were statistically significant differences depending on the occupation, from 8,7% (95% CI: 6,9-10,6) on medics down to 3,2% (95% CI: 1,0-8,0) on personnel not associated with health care. The other characteristics did not associate significantly to antibody presence against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: The SARS-CoV-2 infection frequency in HCP is similar to the estimated in the general population for big cities in Spain. This highlights the effectiveness of the infection control and prevention programme in this healthcare department targeted at healthcare personnel.","Gras-Valentí, Paula; Chico-Sánchez, Pablo; Algado-Sellés, Natividad; Gimeno-Gascón, María Adelina; Mora-Muriel, Juan Gabriel; Jiménez-Sepúlveda, Natali Juliet; Gómez-Sotero, Isel Lilibeth; Montiel-Higuero, Inés; Sánchez-Payá, José; Rodríguez-Díaz, Juan Carlos",Enferm Infecc Microbiol Clin (Engl Ed),407,5

Surveillance data also provides an overview of geographical and temporal changes that are invaluable for guiding interventions. Still, due to limited infrastructure and resources, clinical surveillance data is lacking in many parts of the world. Given that sewage is largely made up of human fecal bacteria from many people, sewage epidemiology could provide a cost-efficient strategy to partly fill the current gap in clinical surveillance of antibiotic resistance. Here we explored the potential of sewage metagenomic data to assess clinical antibiotic resistance prevalence using environmental and clinical surveillance data from across the world. The sewage resistome correlated to clinical surveillance data of invasive Escherichia coli isolates, but none of several tested approaches provided a sufficient resolution for clear discrimination between resistance towards different classes of antibiotics. However, in combination with socioeconomic data, the overall clinical resistance situation could be predicted with good precision. We conclude that analyses of bacterial genes in sewage could contribute to informing management of antibiotic resistance.","Karkman, Antti; Berglund, Fanny; Flach, Carl-Fredrik; Kristiansson, Erik; Larsson, D.

The GI tract acts as a selective barrier between the tissues of the bird and its luminal environment. This barrier is composed of physical, chemical, immunological, and microbiological components. A wide range of factors associated with diet and infectious disease agents can negatively affect the delicate balance among the components of the chicken gut and, as a result, affect health status and production performance of birds in commercial poultry operations. Phasing out of antibiotic growth promoters from poultry diets in Europe and recent moves toward reduction or removal of these compounds in other parts of the world including North America will likely change the microbial profile of the GI tract environment in commercial poultry. This paper reviews the GI tract from developmental, immunological, and microbial standpoints and then discusses factors that can affect health status of this system. Necrotic enteritis and coccidiosis and their interactions, and possible consequences of antibiotic growth promoter removal from poultry diets with respect to these diseases, are discussed in more detail.","Yegani, M.; Korver, D.R.",Poult Sci,407,1

Mitigation measures to reduce workplace exposures have included work site policies to support flexible work site options, including telework, whereby employees work remotely without commuting to a central place of work.* Opportunities to telework have varied across industries among U.S. jobs where telework options are feasible (1). However, little is known about the impact of telework on risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. A case-control investigation was conducted to compare telework between eligible symptomatic persons who received positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results (case-patients, 153) and symptomatic persons with negative test results (control-participants, 161). Eligible participants were identified in outpatient health care facilities during July 2020. Among employed participants who reported on their telework status during the 2 weeks preceding illness onset (248), the percentage who were able to telework on a full- or part-time basis was lower among case-patients (35%; 42 of 120) than among control-participants (53%; 68 of 128) (p<0.01). Case-patients were more likely than were control-participants to have reported going exclusively to an office or school setting (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-2.7) in the 2 weeks before illness onset. The association was also observed when further restricting to the 175 participants who reported working in a profession outside the critical infrastructure† (aOR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.3-3.6). Providing the option to work from home or telework when possible, is an important consideration for reducing the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In industries where telework options are not available, worker safety measures should continue to be scaled up to reduce possible worksite exposures.","Fisher, Kiva A.; Olson, Samantha M.; Tenforde, Mark W.; Feldstein, Leora R.; Lindsell, Christopher J.; Shapiro, Nathan I.; Files, D.

We evaluate Tactowel through a remote user study with 8 professional tennis players, in which they experience, compare and discuss Tactowel. Our results suggest subtle displays could prevent overwhelming and distracting athletes through three distinct design strategies: (1) Restricting the use excluding duration of performance, (2) using the available routines and interactions, and (3) giving an overall abstraction through tangible interaction.

Using a cross-sectional study design, we examined the use of TCMs among ICU patients. The data were from a well-established ICU registry from a large teaching hospital in west China. Our study found that TCM was widely used among ICU, in particular TCM injections and oral liquids. The use of TCM often differed by ICUs, and TCM injections and oral liquids were mostly used in neurological ICU, while Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) were often used in general ICU. The use of TCM was also highly associated with patient characteristics. Patients with pancreatitis were administered with most TCM, patients with cerebrovascular disease with most TCM injections and those with chronic renal failure with most oral liquids. Future efforts should include generation of high-quality evidence guidelines about clinical effects of TCM interventions among ICU patients.

In Indonesia, the first case was reported in early March 2020, and the numbers of confirmed infections have been increasing until now. Efforts to contain the virus globally and in Indonesia are ongoing. This is the very first manuscript using a spatial-temporal model to describe the SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Indonesia, as well as providing a patient profile for all confirmed COVID-19 cases. METHOD: Data was collected from the official website of the Indonesia National Task Force for the Acceleration of COVID-19, from the period of 02 March 2020–02 August 2020. The data from RT-PCR confirmed, SARS-CoV-2 positive patients was categorized according to demographics, symptoms and comorbidities based on case categorization (confirmed, recovered, dead). The data collected provides granular and thorough information on time and geographical location for all 34 Provinces across Indonesia. RESULTS: A cumulative total of 111,450 confirmed cases of were reported in Indonesia during the study period. Of those confirmed cases 67.79% (75,551/111,450) were shown as recovered and 4.83% (5,382/111,450) of them as died. Patients were mostly male (50.52%; 56,300/111,450) and adults aged 31 to 45 years old (29.73%; 33,132/111,450). Overall patient presentation symptoms of cough and fever, as well as chronic disease comorbidities were in line with previously published data from elsewhere in South-East Asia. The data reported here, shows that from the detection of the first confirmed case and within a short time period of 40 days, all the provinces of Indonesia were affected by COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to provide detailed characteristics of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients in Indonesia, including their demographic profile and COVID-19 presentation history. It used a spatial-temporal analysis to present the epidemic spread from the very beginning of the outbreak throughout all provinces in the country. The increase of new confirmed cases has been consistent during this time period for all provinces, with some demonstrating a sharp increase, in part due to the surge in national diagnostic capacity. This information delivers a ready resource that can be used for prediction modelling, and is utilized continuously by the current Indonesian Task Force in order to advise on potential implementation or removal of public distancing measures, and on potential availability of healthcare capacity in their efforts to ultimately manage the outbreak.","Aisyah, Dewi Nur; Mayadewi, Chyntia Aryanti; Diva, Haniena; Kozlakidis, Zisis; Siswanto,; Adisasmito, Wiku",PLoS One,407,26

NTDs represented as circles undergo random motions constrained by the interdomain flexibility while drug molecules are represented by lattice points. It was found that as the interdomain flexibility increases, the time interval between the drug bindings to the 1st and 2nd NTDs decreases, suggesting that the 2nd drug binding is accelerated. Furthermore, this effect was more significant at lower drug concentrations. These results suggest that the interdomain linker plays a key role in the drug binding process and thus emphasize the importance of characterization of their physicochemical properties to better evaluate the efficacy of potential drugs.","Matsuo, Tatsuhito",Biophys Chem,407,20

In a multi-center international study, we investigated if overweight, obesity and diabetes were independently associated with COVID-19 severity, and whether the body mass index (BMI)-associated risk was increased among those with diabetes. Methods: We retrospectively extracted data from health care records and regional databases of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 from 18 sites in 11 countries. We used standardized definitions and analyses to generate site-specific estimates, modelling the odds of each outcome (supplemental oxygen/non-invasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality) by BMI category (reference, overweight, obese) adjusting for age, sex, and pre-specified co-morbidities. Subgroup analysis was performed on patients with pre-existing diabetes. Site-specific estimates were combined in a meta-analysis. Results: Among 7244 patients (65·6% overweight/obese), those with overweight were more likely to require oxygen/non-invasive ventilation (random effects adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.44 [95% CI 1·15-1.80]) and invasive mechanical ventilation (aOR 1.22 [CI 1.03-1.46]). There was no association between overweight and in-hospital mortality (aOR 0.88 [CI 0.74-1.04]). Similar effects were observed in patients with obesity or diabetes. In the subgroup analysis, the aOR for any outcome was not additionally increased in those with diabetes and overweight or obesity. Conclusions: In adults hospitalized with COVID-19, overweight as well as obesity and diabetes increased the odds of respiratory support but not mortality. In patients with diabetes, the odds of severe COVID-19 were not increased above the BMI-associated risk.","Longmore, D. K.; Miller, J.

This has been suggested to be, in part, due to DOX-mediated leakage of endotoxins from gut microflora, which activate Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in macrophages, causing severe inflammation. However, the direct function of DOX on macrophages is still unknown. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that DOX alone is incapable of stimulating inflammatory response in macrophages. Then, we compared the anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin (CUR), resveratrol (RES) and sulforaphane (SFN) against lipopolysaccharide/interferon-gamma (LPS/IFN-γ)-mediated inflammation in the absence or presence of DOX. For this purpose, RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS/IFN-γ (10 ng/mL/10 U/mL) in the absence or presence of DOX (0.1 µM). Our results showed that DOX alone is incapable of stimulating an inflammatory response in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Furthermore, after 24 h of incubation with LPS/IFN-γ, a significant increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA levels was observed. Similarly, nitric oxide (NO) production and TNF-α and IL-6 protein levels were significantly upregulated. Moreover, in LPS/IFN-γ-treated macrophages, the microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-146a, miR-155, and miR-21 were significantly overexpressed. Interestingly, upon testing CUR, RES, and SFN against LPS/IFN-γ-mediated inflammation, only SFN was able to significantly reverse the LPS/IFN-γ-mediated induction of iNOS, TNF-α and IL-6 and attenuate miR-146a and miR-155 levels. In conclusion, SFN, at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels, exhibits potent immunomodulatory action against LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated macrophages, which may indicate SFN as a potential treatment for DOX-associated inflammation.","Saleh, Haidy A.; Ramdan, Eman; Elmazar, Mohey M.; Azzazy, Hassan M.

It is impendent to explore whether inactivated COVID-19 vaccine widely used in China influences prothrombotic autoantibody production and induces thrombosis. In this prospective study, we recruited 406 healthcare workers who received two doses, 21 days apart, of inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine (BBIBP-CorV, Sinopharm). Paired blood samples taken before vaccination and four weeks after the second vaccination were used in detecting prothrombotic autoantibodies, including anticardiolipin (aCL), anti-β2 glycoprotein I (aβ2GP1), anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (aPS/PT), and anti-PF4-heparin. The seroconversion rate of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies was 95.81% (389/406) four weeks after vaccination. None of the subjects had spontaneous thrombosis or thrombocytopenia over a minimum follow-up period of eight weeks. There was no significant difference in the presence of all ten autoantibodies between samples collected before and after vaccination: for aCL, IgG (7 vs. 8, P = 0.76), IgM (41 vs. 44, P = 0.73), IgA (4 vs. 4, P = 1.00); anti-β2GP1, IgG (7 vs. 6, P = 0.78), IgM (6 vs. 5, P = 0.76), IgA (3 vs. 5, P = 0.72); aPS/PT IgG (0 vs. 0, P = 1.00), IgM (6 vs. 5, P = 0.76); aPF4-heparin (2 vs. 7, P = 0.18), and antinuclear antibody (ANA) (18 vs. 21, P = 0.62). Notably, seven cases presented with anti-PF4-heparin antibodies (range: 1.18–1.79 U/mL) after vaccination, and none of them exhibited any sign of thrombotic disorder.

Most of the vaccine and drug development has focused on the spike proteins and viral RNA-polymerases and main protease for viral replication. Using the bioinformatics and structural modelling approach, we modelled the structure of the envelope (E)-protein of novel SARS-CoV-2. The E-protein of this virus shares sequence similarity with that of SARS- CoV-1, and is highly conserved in the N-terminus regions. Incidentally, compared to spike proteins, E proteins demonstrate lower disparity and mutability among the isolated sequences. Using homology modelling, we found that the most favorable structure could function as a gated ion channel conducting H(+) ions. Combining pocket estimation and docking with water, we determined that GLU 8 and ASN 15 in the N-terminal region were in close proximity to form H-bonds which was further validated by insertion of the E protein in an ERGIC-mimic membrane. Additionally, two distinct “core” structures were visible, the hydrophobic core and the central core, which may regulate the opening/closing of the channel. We propose this as a mechanism of viral ion channeling activity which plays a critical role in viral infection and pathogenesis. In addition, it provides a structural basis and additional avenues for vaccine development and generating therapeutic interventions against the virus.","Sarkar, Manish; Saha, Soham",PLoS One,407,1

This study aimed to evaluate the predictors of stress symptoms among Chinese university students during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. MATERIAL/METHODS: We used a self-reported questionnaire, the PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder) Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) to evaluate the stress symptoms among Chinese university students from Heilongjiang (n=455), Beijing (n=106), Shanghai (n=419) and Sichuan (n=102). We then analyzed the predictors of stress symptoms. RESULTS: The proportion of university students enrolled in this study who met symptomatic criteria for PTSD was 2% (22 students). The mean PCL-C total score in the sample was 22.09±8.01. The correlational analyses revealed a significant positive relationship between the PCL-C total score and area, and university grade (P<0.01). Moreover, a negative relationship was found between the PCL-C total score and gender, having H1N1 influenza, having family members, friends or acquaintances having H1N1 influenza, and being afraid of H1N1 influenza (P<0.01). The regression analyses showed that in North China, female gender, having H1N1 influenza, having family members or acquaintances with H1N1 influenza, and being afraid of H1N1 influenza were significant predictors of the stress symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In North China, female gender, having H1N1 influenza, having family members, friends, or acquaintances with H1N1 influenza, and being afraid of H1N1 influenza were significant predictors of the stress symptoms.","Xu, Jiahong; Zheng, Yayuan; Wang, Mingmin; Zhao, Jiangmin; Zhan, Qing; Fu, Mingxu; Wang, Qianyi; Xiao, Junjie; Cheng, Yan",Med Sci Monit,407,16

The purpose of our study is to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient outcomes and the healthcare system in Ontario, Canada. Methods: We developed an individual-level simulation to model the flow of COVID-19 patients through the Ontario healthcare system. We simulated different combined scenarios of epidemic trajectory and healthcare capacity. Outcomes include numbers of patients needing admission to the ward, Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and requiring ventilation; days to resource depletion; and numbers of patients awaiting resources and deaths associated with limited access to resources. Findings: We demonstrate that with effective early public health measures system resources need not be depleted. For scenarios considering late or ineffective implementation of physical distancing, health system resources would be depleted within 14-26 days. Resource depletion was also avoided or delayed with aggressive measures to rapidly increase ICU, ventilator, and acute care hospital capacity. Interpretation: We found that without aggressive physical distancing measures the Ontario healthcare system would have been inadequately equipped to manage the expected number of patients with COVID-19, despite the rapid capacity increase. This overall lack of resources would have led to an increase in mortality. By slowing the spread of the disease via ongoing public health measures and having increased healthcare capacity, Ontario may have avoided catastrophic stresses to its health care system.","Barrett, Kali; Khan, Yasin A; Mac, Stephen; Ximenes, Raphael; Naimark, David MJ; Sander, Beate",,407,1

Singlet oxygen (1 O 2) and a reaction product of it, excited carbonyls (CO*), are important ROS. 1 O 2 and CO* are nonradicalic and emit light (one photon/molecule) when returning to ground state oxygen. Especially activated polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes (PMN) produce large amounts of 1 O 2 . Via activation of the respiratory burst (NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase) they synthesize hypochlorite (NaOCl) and chloramines (in particular N-chlorotaurine). Chloramines are selective and stable chemical generators of 1 O 2 . In the human organism, 1 O 2 is both a signal and a weapon with therapeutic potency against very different pathogens, such as microbes, virus, cancer cells and thrombi. Chloramines at blood concentrations between 1 and 2mmol/L inactivate lipid enveloped virus and chloramines at blood concentrations below 0.5 mmol/L, i.e. at oxidant concentrations that do not affect thrombocytes or hemostasis factors, act antithrombotically by activation of the physiologic PMN mediated fibrinolysis; this thrombolysis is of selective nature, i.e. it does not impair the hemostasis system of the patient allowing the antithrombotic treatment in patients where the current risky thrombolytic treatment is contraindicated. The action of 1 O 2 might be compared to the signaling and destroying gunfire of soldiers directed against bandits at night, resulting in an autorecruitment of the physiological inflammatory response. Chloramines (such as the mild and untoxic oxidant chloramine T® (N-chloro-p-toluene-sulfonamide)) and their signaling and destroying reaction product 1 O 2 might be promising new therapeutic agents against a multitude of up to now refractory diseases.","Stief, Thomas W",Medical Hypotheses,407,16

The developed model was validated by experimentation and by published empirical data. Three stages are identified with respect to time for the variation of the IPE: a first stage dominated by the propagation and decay of the exhaled jet, a particles' redistribution stage, and a particles' removal stage. The inhaled dose is affected by the DV flow rate, cough velocity, particle diameter and distance between the occupants. The DV system with a flow rate of 100 L/s reduced significantly the inhaled dose during particle redistribution and removal stages decreasing the total inhaled dose by 83% compared to a flow rate of 50 L/s. IPE is higher when particle diameter is increased from 1 to 20 μm due to the opposition of particle removal by the upward DV. A comparison between steady and transient modeling of the IPE showed that steady modeling captures the physics affecting particle spread due to HMRA but it over-predicts the inhaled dose. It is found that for a DV flow rate of 100 L/s and a cough velocity of 22 m/s during 1 s, and 1 μm particles, the minimum required distance between the occupants for a threshold inhaled dose of 10(−5) kg is nearly 0.5 m by transient modeling while it is 2.15 m by steady state modeling.","Habchi, Carine; Ghali, Kamel; Ghaddar, Nesreen",Build Environ,407,16

However, they have not issued any guidelines for the safe establishment and operation of an HMB. This gap contributes to the demand for gathering experiences from HMB networks, especially those from lower-middle income countries. To fill this knowledge gap, this study examines the characteristics of donors, donation, pasteurization, and recipients during the first four years of operation in the first HMB in Vietnam. Methods: Data about the donors, donation, pasteurization, and recipients were extracted from the web-based electronic monitoring system of the HMB from 1 February 2017 to 31 January 2021. Results: In the first four years of operation there were 433 donors who donated 7642 L of milk (66% from the community) with an increased trend in the amount of donated milk, donation duration, and average amount of milk donated by a donor. Approximately 98% of the donated milk was pasteurized, and 82% passed both pre- and post-pasteurization tests. Although the pass rate tended to increase with time, a few dips occurred. Of 16,235 newborns who received pasteurized donor milk, two thirds were in the postnatal wards. The main reason for the prescription of pasteurized donor milk was insufficient mothers’ own milk in the first few days after birth. There was a decreased trend in the amount and duration of using pasteurized donor milk in both postnatal wards and the neonatal unit. Conclusions: The HMB has operated efficiently in the previous four years, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, to serve vulnerable newborns. Ongoing evidence-based adjustments helped to improve the operation to recruit suitable donors, to increase the access to and quality of raw donor milk, to improve the pasteurization process, and to meet the need of more newborns.","Tran, Hoang Thi; Nguyen, Tuan Thanh; Barnett, Debbie; Weaver, Gillian; Nguyen, Oanh Thi Xuan; Van Ngo, Quang; Le, Huong Thi Thanh; Huynh, Le Thi; Do, Chung Thi; Mathisen, Roger",Nutrients,407,33

Depressive symptoms were measured on seven occasions (21st March - 2nd April), using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Sociodemographic vulnerabilities included non-white ethnic background, low socio-economic position (SEP), and type of work (keyworker versus no keyworker). Health-related and psychosocial vulnerabilities included pre-existing physical and mental health conditions, experience of psychological and/or physical abuse, and low social support. Group-based DST were derived using latent growth mixture modelling and multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to examine the association between these vulnerabilities and DSTs. Model estimates were adjusted for age, sex, and suspected COVID-19 diagnosis. Results: Three DSTs were identified: low [N=30,850 (60%)] moderate [N=14,911 (29%)], and severe [N=5,656 (11%)] depressive symptoms. DSTs were relatively stable across the first 6 weeks of lockdown.

Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) models are mathematical representations of pathophysiology for simulating and predicting the effects of existing or putative therapies. The application of model‐based approaches, including QSP, have accelerated the development of some novel therapeutics. Nevertheless, the development of disease‐scale mechanistic models can be a slow process, often taking years to be validated and considered mature. Furthermore, emerging data may make any QSP model quickly obsolete. We present a prototype QSP model to facilitate further development by the scientific community. The model accounts for the interactions between viral dynamics, the major host immune response mediators and tissue damage and regeneration. The immune response is determined by viral activation of innate and adaptive immune processes that regulate viral clearance and cell damage. The prototype model captures two physiologically relevant outcomes following infection: a “healthy” immune response that appropriately defends against the virus, and an uncontrolled alveolar inflammatory response that is characteristic of acute respiratory distress syndrome. We aim to significantly shorten the typical QSP model development and validation timeline by encouraging community use, testing, and refinement of this prototype model. It is our expectation that the model will be further advanced in an open science approach (i.e., by multiple contributions toward a validated quantitative platform in an open forum), with the ultimate goal of informing and accelerating the development of safe and effective treatment options for patients.","Dai, Wei; Rao, Rohit; Sher, Anna; Tania, Nessy; Musante, Cynthia J.; Allen, Richard",CPT Pharmacometrics Syst Pharmacol,407,0

Viral agents cause the majority of sore throats. However, there is not currently a score to diagnose viral sore throat. The aims of this study were (i) to find the rate of bacterial and viral causes, (ii) to show the seasonal variations and (iii) to form a new scoring system to diagnose viral sore throat. METHODS. A throat culture for group A beta haemolytic streptococci (GABHS) and a nasopharyngeal swab to detect 16 respiratory viruses were obtained from each patient. Over a period of 52 weeks, a total of 624 throat cultures and polymerase chain reaction analyses were performed. Logistic regression analysis was performed to find the clinical score. RESULTS. Viral infection was found in 277 patients (44.3%), and GABHS infection was found in 116 patients (18.5%). An infectious cause was found in 356 patients (57.1%). Rhinovirus was the most commonly detected infectious agent overall (highest in November, 34.5%), and the highest GABHS rate was in November (32.7%). Analysis of data provided a scoring system, called the Mistik Score, to diagnose viral sore throat. The predictive model for positive viral analysis included the following variables: absence of headache, stuffy nose, sneezing, temperature of ≥37.5°C on physical examination, and the absence of tonsillar exudate and/or swelling. The probability of a positive viral analysis for a score of 5 was 82.1%. CONCLUSION. The Mistik Score may be useful to diagnose viral sore throat.

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of depressive symptoms in PWE and their correlation with epilepsy features and access to treatment. METHODS: PWE were invited to answer a cross-sectional online-based survey to assess and rate depressive symptoms using the NDDI-E during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and its relation to multiple lifestyles epilepsy clinical aspects. RESULTS: A total of 490 PWE were recruited. The prevalence of depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic was 35.3% (cutoff score > 15 on NDDI-E). The factors associated with higher NDDI-E scores were: female sex, increased seizure frequency, barriers to access to their treating physician and antiseizure medication, and unemployment. Regarding the pandemic impact on PWE healthcare, 29.2% reported restricted access to their medication, 46.1% barriers to access their physicians, 94.2% had their consultations canceled due to the pandemic, and 28.4% had seizure worsening in this period. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic affected PWE access to the healthcare system.

METHODS: From 2 April to 30 April 2021, we conducted an online, international survey of adults with systemic rheumatic disease who received COVID-19 vaccination. We collected patient-reported data on clinician communication, beliefs and intent about discontinuing disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) around the time of vaccination, and patient-reported adverse events after vaccination. RESULTS: We analysed 2860 adults with systemic rheumatic diseases who received COVID-19 vaccination (mean age 55.3 years, 86.7% female, 86.3% white). Types of COVID-19 vaccines were Pfizer-BioNTech (53.2%), Oxford/AstraZeneca (22.6%), Moderna (21.3%), Janssen/Johnson & Johnson (1.7%) and others (1.2%). The most common rheumatic disease was rheumatoid arthritis (42.3%), and 81.2% of respondents were on a DMARD. The majority (81.9%) reported communicating with clinicians about vaccination. Most (66.9%) were willing to temporarily discontinue DMARDs to improve vaccine efficacy, although many (44.3%) were concerned about rheumatic disease flares. After vaccination, the most reported patient-reported adverse events were fatigue/somnolence (33.4%), headache (27.7%), muscle/joint pains (22.8%) and fever/chills (19.9%). Rheumatic disease flares that required medication changes occurred in 4.6%. CONCLUSION: Among adults with systemic rheumatic disease who received COVID-19 vaccination, patient-reported adverse events were typical of those reported in the general population. Most patients were willing to temporarily discontinue DMARDs to improve vaccine efficacy. The relatively low frequency of rheumatic disease flare requiring medications was reassuring.","Sattui, Sebastian Eduardo; Liew, Jean W; Kennedy, Kevin; Sirotich, Emily; Putman, Michael; Moni, Tarin T; Akpabio, Akpabio; Alpízar-Rodríguez, Deshiré; Berenbaum, Francis; Bulina, Inita; Conway, Richard; Singh, Aman Dev; Duff, Eimear; Durrant, Karen L; Gheita, Tamer A; Hill, Catherine L; Howard, Richard A; Hoyer, Bimba F; Hsieh, Evelyn; El Kibbi, Lina; Kilian, Adam; Kim, Alfred Hyoungju; Liew, David F L; Lo, Chieh; Miller, Bruce; Mingolla, Serena; Nudel, Michal; Palmerlee, Candace A; Singh, Jasvinder A; Singh, Namrata; Ugarte-Gil, Manuel Francisco; Wallace, John; Young, Kristen J; Bhana, Suleman; Costello, Wendy; Grainger, Rebecca; Machado, Pedro M; Robinson, Philip C; Sufka, Paul; Wallace, Zachary S; Yazdany, Jinoos; Harrison, Carly; Larché, Maggie; Levine, Mitchell; Foster, Gary; Thabane, Lehana; Rider, Lisa G; Hausmann, Jonathan S; Simard, Julia F; Sparks, Jeffrey A",RMD Open,407,20

There is a requirement to research as many new and different types of approaches as possible to cater to the entire world population, complementing the vaccines with promising results. The need is also because SARS‐CoV‐2 has several unknown or variable facets which get revealed from time to time. In this work, in silico scientific findings are presented, which are indicative of the potential for the use of the LL‐37 human anti‐microbial peptide as a therapeutic against SARS‐CoV‐2. This indication is based on the high structural similarity of LL‐37 to the N‐terminal helix, with which the virus interacts, of the receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2. Moreover, there is positive prediction of binding of LL‐37 to the receptor‐binding domain of SARS‐CoV‐2; this is the first study to have described this interaction. In silico data on the safety of LL‐37 are also reported. As Vitamin D is known to upregulate the expression of LL‐37, the vitamin is a candidate preventive molecule. This work provides the possible basis for an inverse correlation between Vitamin D levels in the body and the severity of or susceptibility to Covid‐19, as widely reported in literature. With the scientific link put forth herein, Vitamin D could be used at an effective, medically prescribed, safe dose as a preventive. The information in this report would be valuable in bolstering the worldwide efforts to eliminate the pandemic as early as possible.","Lokhande, Kiran Bharat; Banerjee, Tanushree; Swamy, Kakumani Venkateswara; Ghosh, Payel; Deshpande, Manisha",Proteins,407,20

However, how childhood sleep and children's adaptive behavior (i.e., coping strategies) bidirectionally interact is currently less known. Using a within-subjects design and actigraphy-measured sleep from 16 preschool-aged children (M(age) = 56.4 months, SD = 10.8, range: 36–70 months), this study investigated how prior sleep patterns relate to children's coping during a potentially stressful event, the COVID-19 pandemic, and how prior coping skills may influence children's sleep during the pandemic. Children who woke earlier had greater negative expression both before and during the pandemic. During the pandemic, children slept longer and woke later on average compared to before the pandemic. Additionally, for children engaged in at-home learning, sleeping longer was associated with less negative expression.

Stressors from the pandemic are likely to be experienced in many ways by older adults with heterogeneous life experiences and supports available. In this context, it is necessary to tease out the underlying mechanisms leading to positive and negative well-being and mental health across interdependent individual, social and environmental factors. The aim of the present study is to explore community-dwelling older adults’ experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular focus on mental health and psychosocial well-being. Methods: An exploratory longitudinal qualitative study will be conducted with data collected through written submissions, sitting interviews and walk along interviews with older adults living in Irish community settings. Data collection will take place 3 to 10 weeks apart to enable the exploration of individuals’ responses to the evolving social, economic and environmental circumstances derived from the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland. An iterative thematic analysis will be carried out to identify data themes, linkages, and explanations within a socio-ecological framework.

It introduces meshwork as a novel theoretical lens to examine the ontological assumptions underlying the shadow and informal dynamics of organizing food. Through a longitudinal qualitative case study, we place relationality and becoming at the centre of organizing food and food systems, demonstrating how entangled relationships can create a complex ontology through the meshwork knots, threads and weave. We show how issues of collective concern come together to form dynamic knots of interactions, how the threads within the meshwork indicate processes of movement, and how the weave suggests degrees of food system resilience—but always in flow. This theoretical approach thus provides a platform for addressing thoughtful concerns about “food matters” including the integrity of our global food system, the negative health and environmental impacts of industrialized food production, and food safety issues.","Pavlovich, Kathryn; Henderson, Alison; Barling, David",Agric Human Values,407,1

To assure the proper protection without overuse of limited supply of these equipments, screening of patients before surgical or diagnostic procedure was implemented. This study evaluates the results of this screening. METHOD: All patients screened for COVID-19 before procedure warranting either general, locoregional anaesthesia or sedation were included. Screening included a symptom questionnaire by phone, PCR and HRCT chest testing. Surgical or procedural details were registered together with actions taken based on screening results. RESULTS: Three hundred ninety-eight screenings were performed on 386 patients. The symptom questionnaire was completed in 72% of screenings. In 371 screenings, PCR testing was performed and negative. HRCT chest found 18 cases where COVID-19 could not be excluded, with negative PCR testing. Three patients had their surgery postponed due to inconclusive screening, and additional measures were taken in three other patients. There were incidental findings in 14% of HRCT chest scans. DISCUSSION: Pre-operative screening will differentiate if PPE is needed for procedures and which patients can safely have elective surgery during this COVID-19 pandemic and in the times to come. HRCT chest has no additional value in the pre-operative screening of asymptomatic patients. Screening can be performed with a symptom questionnaire, and additional screening with PCR testing in high-risk patient groups should be considered.","Huybens, E. M.; Bus, M. P. A.; Massaad, R.

METHODS: We conducted a study involving adults (≥50 years of age) with Covid-19–like illness who underwent molecular testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We assessed 41,552 admissions to 187 hospitals and 21,522 visits to 221 emergency departments or urgent care clinics during the period from January 1 through June 22, 2021, in multiple states. The patients’ vaccination status was documented in electronic health records and immunization registries. We used a test-negative design to estimate vaccine effectiveness by comparing the odds of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 infection among vaccinated patients with those among unvaccinated patients. Vaccine effectiveness was adjusted with weights based on propensity-for-vaccination scores and according to age, geographic region, calendar time (days from January 1, 2021, to the index date for each medical visit), and local virus circulation. RESULTS: The effectiveness of full messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccination (≥14 days after the second dose) was 89% (95% confidence interval [CI], 87 to 91) against laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to hospitalization, 90% (95% CI, 86 to 93) against infection leading to an ICU admission, and 91% (95% CI, 89 to 93) against infection leading to an emergency department or urgent care clinic visit. The effectiveness of full vaccination with respect to a Covid-19–associated hospitalization or emergency department or urgent care clinic visit was similar with the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines and ranged from 81% to 95% among adults 85 years of age or older, persons with chronic medical conditions, and Black or Hispanic adults. The effectiveness of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was 68% (95% CI, 50 to 79) against laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to hospitalization and 73% (95% CI, 59 to 82) against infection leading to an emergency department or urgent care clinic visit. CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 vaccines in the United States were highly effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring hospitalization, ICU admission, or an emergency department or urgent care clinic visit.

Thus, it is important to predict COVID-19 symptom exacerbation at an early stage prior to increasing severity in patients. Patients with COVID-19 could experience a unique “silent hypoxia” at an early stage of the infection when they are apparently asymptomatic, but with rather low SpO(2) (oxygen saturation) levels. In order to continuously monitor SpO(2) in daily life, a high-performance wearable device, such as the Apple Watch or Fitbit, has become commercially available to monitor several biometric data including steps, resting heart rate (RHR), physical activity, sleep quality, and estimated oxygen variation (EOV). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to test whether EOV measured by the wearable device Fitbit can predict COVID-19 symptom exacerbation. METHODS: We recruited patients with COVID-19 from August to November 2020. Patients were asked to wear the Fitbit for 30 days, and biometric data including EOV and RHR were extracted. EOV is a relative physiological measure that reflects users’ SpO(2) levels during sleep. We defined a high EOV signal as a patient’s oxygen level exhibiting a significant dip and recovery within the index period, and a high RHR signal as daily RHR exceeding 5 beats per day compared with the minimum RHR of each patient in the study period. We defined successful prediction as the appearance of those signals within 2 days before the onset of the primary outcome. The primary outcome was the composite of deaths of all causes, use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, use of mechanical ventilation, oxygenation, and exacerbation of COVID-19 symptoms, irrespective of readmission. We also assessed each outcome individually as secondary outcomes. We made weekly phone calls to discharged patients to check on their symptoms. RESULTS: We enrolled 23 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed by a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test. The patients had a mean age of 50.9 (SD 20) years, and 70% (n=16) were female. Each patient wore the Fitbit for 30 days. COVID-19 symptom exacerbation occurred in 6 (26%) patients. We were successful in predicting exacerbation using EOV signals in 4 out of 5 cases (sensitivity=80%, specificity=90%), whereas the sensitivity and specificity of high RHR signals were 50% and 80%, respectively, both lower than those of high EOV signals. Coincidental obstructive sleep apnea syndrome confirmed by polysomnography was detected in 1 patient via consistently high EOV signals. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study successfully detected early COVID-19 symptom exacerbation by measuring EOV, which may help to identify the early signs of COVID-19 exacerbation.

The use of current, precise and realistic methods to model spatial accessibility to healthcare and thus improved decision-making is helping this process. Generally, these methods—which include the family of floating catchment area (FCA) methods—incorporate a number of criteria that address topics like access, efficiency, budget, equity and the overall system utilization. How can we measure spatial accessibility? This paper investigates a sophisticated approach for quantifying the spatial accessibility of general practitioners. (GPs). Our objective is the investigation and application of a spatial accessibility index by an improved Huff three-step floating catchment area (MH3SFCA) method. METHODS: We modify and implement the huff model three-step floating catchment area (MH3SFCA) method and exemplary calculation of the spatial accessibility indices for the test study area. The method is extended to incorporate a more realistic way to model the distance decay effect. To that end, instead of a binary approach, a continuous approach is employed. Therefore, each distance between a healthcare site and the population is incorporated individually. The study area includes Swabia and the city of Augsburg, Germany. The data for analysis is obtained from following data sources: (1) Acxiom Deutschland GmbH (2020) provided a test dataset for the locations of general practitioners (GPs); (2) OpenStreetMap (OSM) data is utilized for road networks; and (3) the Statistische Ämter des Bundes und der Länder (German official census 2011) provided a population distribution dataset stemming from the 2011 Census. RESULTS: The spatial accessibility indices are distributed in an inhomogeneous as well as polycentric pattern for the general practitioners (GPs). Differences in spatial accessibility are found mainly between urban and rural areas. The transitions from lower to higher values of accessibility or vice versa in general are smooth rather than abrupt. The results indicate that the MH3SFCA method is suited for comparing the spatial accessibility of GPs in different regions. The results of the MH3SFCA method can be used to indicate over- and undersupplied areas. However, the absolute values of the indices do not inherently define accessibility to be too low or too high. Instead, the indices compare the spatial relationships between each supply and demand location. As a result, the higher the value of the accessibility indices, the higher the opportunities for the respective population locations. The result for the study area are exemplary as the test input data has a high uncertainty. Depending on the objective, it might be necessary to further analyze the results of the method. CONCLUSIONS: The application of the MH3SFCA method on small-scale data can provide an overview of accessibility for the whole study area. As many factors have to be taken into account, the outcomes are too complex for a direct and clear interpretation of why indices are low or high. The MH3SFCA method can be used to detect differences in accessibility on a small scale. In order to effectively detect over- or undersupply, further analysis must be conducted and/or different (legal) constraints must be applied. The methodology requires input data of high quality.","Subal, Julia; Paal, Piret; Krisp, Jukka M.",Int J Health Geogr,407,7

Although physicians and students have been involved in protests related to the COVID-19 pandemic, structural racism, police brutality, and gender inequity, resistance has not been prominent in medical education's discourses, and medical education has not supported students' role and responsibility in developing professional approaches to resistance. While learners should not pick and choose what aspects of medical education they engage with, neither should their moral agency and integrity be compromised. To that end, the authors argue for professional resistance to become a part of medical education. This article sets out a rationale for a more explicit and critical recognition of the role of resistance in medical education, by exploring its conceptual basis, its place both in training and practice, and the ways in which medical education might more actively embrace and situate resistance as a core aspect of professional practice. The authors suggest different strategies that medical educators can employ to embrace resistance in medical education and propose a set of principles for resistance in medicine and medical education. Embracing resistance as part of medical education requires a shift in attention away from training physicians solely to replicate and sustain existing systems and practices and toward developing their ability and responsibility to resist situations, structures, and acts that are oppressive, harmful, or unjust.","Ellaway, Rachel H; Wyatt, Tasha R",Acad. med,407,2

Despite recent significant advances in single-family therapy, the evidence base for MFT remains relatively small. Several individual and family factors have been associated with poorer outcomes in single-family therapy, many of which may be addressed or ameliorated by MFT if delivered early in treatment. This trial aims to determine the feasibility and acceptability of adding a five-day multi-family therapy group to the early stages of family therapy for anorexia nervosa. Secondary objectives are to explore effect size changes in key individual and family factors across treatment. METHODS: This feasibility trial will use a randomised controlled design. Sixty adolescents (age 10–17 inclusive) with anorexia nervosa or atypical anorexia nervosa and their parents will be recruited from a community-based specialist eating disorder service in London, UK. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive six months of eating disorder focussed family therapy with a five-day MFT group (experimental group) or without (control group). Block randomisation will be conducted by the King’s Clinical Trials Unit and researchers will be blind to participants’ intervention allocation. Feasibility, acceptability and secondary outcomes measures will be collected at baseline, post-MFT, end of treatment, six-month and 12-month follow-up. Feasibility and acceptability will be assessed according to trial sign-up rates, retention, measure completion rates and satisfaction. Secondary outcomes include physical health improvements, changes in psychiatric symptoms, emotion regulation and reflective function capacity, expressed emotion, parental difficulties and therapeutic alliance. Descriptive data and exploration analysis of trends and effect sizes will be reported upon at trial completion. DISCUSSION: The five-day MFT program developed for this study is novel, brief and more accessible than previous MFT models. The inclusion of a data collection point during treatment and follow-up will allow for an investigation of trends during and after treatment. This will allow exploration and comparison of future potential mediators and moderators of MFT and FT-AN outcomes and how these may differ between treatments.

METHODS: We systematically searched for literature up to September 2020, and included English-language publications of RCTs among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We conducted network meta-analysis combining results of both the direct and indirect comparisons of interventions. The efficacy outcomes were clinical progression, all-cause mortality, and viral clearance, and safety outcomes were diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. We generated treatment rankings (best to worst) and summarized rank probabilities using rankogram. RESULTS: We included 15 RCTs (14,418 patients) from 7,237 retrieved citations. There was no evidence for efficacy of the assessed antivirals compared with placebo/no treatment or with another antiviral for all efficacy outcomes. Lopinavir (400 mg)/ritonavir (100 mg) significantly increased diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting compared with placebo/no treatment and other antivirals, and was ranked worst for these outcomes, while triazavirin (250 mg), baloxavir marboxil (80 mg), and remdesivir (100 mg – 10 days) ranked best, respectively.

The global pandemic and the immediate switch to remote instruction forced instructors to reconsider how they can use computation to teach concepts previously approached with other instructional methods. In this review, we survey some of the curricula, materials, and resources for instructors who want to include theory, simulation, and computation in the undergraduate curriculum. There has been a notable progression from teaching students to use discipline-specific computational tools to developing interactive computational tools that promote active learning to having students write code themselves, such that they view computation as another tool for solving problems. We are moving toward a future where computational skills, including programming, data analysis, visualization, and simulation, will no longer be considered an optional bonus for students but a required skill for the 21st century STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) workforce; therefore, all physical and life science students should learn to program in the undergraduate curriculum.","McDonald, Ashley Ringer; Roberts, Rebecca; Koeppe, Julia R; Hall, Bonnie L",Current opinion in structural biology,407,5

Methods We collected demographic and epidemiological information of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hefei and Shenzhen between January 19 and February 11, 2020, from data officially published by the provincial and municipal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). From these data we calculated basic reproduction number R0 to reflect the rate of spread of COVID-19 in these cities. Aggregated data of population migration during the same period was extracted from Baidu Migration. The change of R0 in the two cites were analyzed and compared. Spearman correlation analysis between R0 and population inflow from epidemic focus were performed. Results A total of 157 confirmed cases was identified in Hefei by 24:00 February 11, 2020, with an average age of 44.4±15.6 years, 74 female (47.1%) and 386 confirmed cases were identified in Shenzhen, with an average age of 45.15±17.99 years, 202 female (52.3%). Significant difference in the proportion of imported cases between the two cities was observed (Hefei vs Shenzhen, 24.2% vs 74.9%, p=0.000). Before January 31 2020, during the initial stage of the Level 1 Response to Major Public Health Emergencies, there was no significant association observed in Shenzhen between R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P =0.260, r=-0.452); meanwhile in Hefei, such association was strong (P =0.000, r=1.0). However, after the initial stage of response, the situation reversed. A weak association was observed in Shenzhen between be R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P=0.073, r=0.536) but not in Hefei (P =0.498, r=0.217). Conclusion Following Level 1 Response, consistent decline of R0 of COVID-19 was observed in both Hefei and Shenzhen. Different patterns of disease spread were observed in the two cities, driven by different patterns of population migration. This indicated that population migration should be taken into consideration when we set controlling policy of a novel infectious disease.","Ding, Yu; Luo, Sihui; Zheng, Xueying; Ling, Ping; Yue, Tong; Liu, Zhirong; Weng, Jianping",,407,16

METHODS: A survey conducted in 21 intensive care units in 17 provinces in China. RESULTS: Out of 733 questionnaires distributed, 695 were completed. Three hundred and fifty-six respondents (51.2%) reported their experience of caring for H1N1 patients. Despite the fact that 88.5% of all respondents ultimately finished an H1N1 training program, only 41.9% admitted that they had the knowledge of 2009 H1N1 influenza. A total of 572 respondents (82.3%) expressed willingness to care for H1N1 patients. Independent variables associated with increasing likelihood to care for patients in the logistic regression analysis were physicians or nurses rather than other professionals (odds ratio 4.056 and 3.235, p = 0.002 and 0.007, respectively), knowledge training prior to patient care (odds ratio 1.531, p = 0.044), and the confidence to know how to protect themselves and their patients (odds ratio 2.109, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Critical care clinicians reported poor knowledge of H1N1 influenza, even though most finished a relevant knowledge training program. Implementation of appropriate education program might improve compliance to infection control measures, and willingness to work in a pandemic.","Ma, Xiaochun; He, Zhenyang; Wang, Yushan; Jiang, Li; Xu, Yuan; Qian, Chuanyun; Sun, Rongqing; Chen, Erzhen; Hu, Zhenjie; Zhou, Lihua; Zhou, Fachun; Qin, Tiehe; Cao, Xiangyuan; An, Youzhong; Sun, Renhua; Zhang, Xijing; Lin, Jiandong; Ai, Yuhang; Wu, Dawei; Du, Bin",BMC Infect Dis,407,20

Recent data have indicated that fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 is common, and that viral RNA can be detected in wastewater. This suggests that wastewater monitoring is a potentially efficient tool for both epidemiological surveillance, and early warning for SARS-CoV-2 circulation at the population level. In this study we sampled an urban wastewater infrastructure in the city of Ashkelon, Israel, during the end of the first COVID-19 wave in May 2020 when the number of infections seemed to be waning. We were able to show varying presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater from several locations in the city during two sampling periods. This was expressed as a new index, Normalized Viral Load (NVL), which can be used in different area scales to define levels of virus activity such as red (high) or green (no), and to follow morbidity in the population at tested area. Our index showed the rise in viral load between the two sampling periods (one week apart) and indicated an increase in morbidity that was evident a month later in the population. Thus, this methodology may provide an early indication for SARS-CoV-2 infection outbreak in a population before an outbreak is clinically apparent.","Yaniv, K.; Shagan, M.; Kramarsky-Winter, E.; Indenbaum, V.; Weil, M.; Elul, M.; Erster, O.; Sela Brown, A.; Mendelson, E.; Mannasse, B.; Shirazi, R.; Lakkakula, S.; Miron, O.; Rinott, E.; Baibich, R.

We also examined whether MedDiet modified the association between leukocyte count alterations and all-cause mortality. Both MedDiet interventions were associated with a lower risk of developing leukopenia (incidence rates: 5.06% in control diet, 3.29% in MedDiet groups combined; hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.54 [0.36–0.80]) and severe leukopenia (incidence rates: 1.26% in control diet, 0.46% in MedDiet groups combined; hazard ratio: 0.25 [0.10–0.60]).

When the relationship is nonlinear, linear modeling techniques do not capture the nonlinear information content. Statistical learning (SL) techniques with kernels are capable of addressing nonlinear problems without making parametric assumptions. However, these techniques do not produce findings relevant for epidemiologic interpretations. A simulated case-control study was used to contrast the information embedding characteristics and separation boundaries produced by a specific SL technique with logistic regression (LR) modeling representing a parametric approach. The SL technique was comprised of a kernel mapping in combination with a perceptron neural network. Because the LR model has an important epidemiologic interpretation, the SL method was modified to produce the analogous interpretation and generate odds ratios for comparison. RESULTS: The SL approach is capable of generating odds ratios for main effects and risk factor interactions that better capture nonlinear relationships between exposure variables and outcome in comparison with LR. CONCLUSIONS: The integration of SL methods in epidemiology may improve both the understanding and interpretation of complex exposure/disease relationships.","Heine, John J; Land, Walker H; Egan, Kathleen M",BMC Bioinformatics,407,1

The gene cluster PFNA consists of five genes including fn3, which codes for a protein containing two fibronectin type III domains. Each fibronectin domain contains sites similar to cytokine-binding sites of human receptors. Based on this finding we assumed that this protein would bind specifically to human cytokines in vitro. We cloned a fragment of the fn3 gene (1503 bp; 501 aa) containing two fibronectin domains, from the strain B. longum subsp. longum GT15. After cloning the fragment into the expression vector pET16b and expressing it in E. coli, the protein product was purified to a homogenous state for further analysis. Using the immunoferment method, we tested the purified fragment's ability to bind the following human cytokines: IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα. We developed a sandwich ELISA system to detect any specific interactions between the purified protein and any of the studied cytokines.

Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have shown promising results. With advances in wearable sensors and improved integration, mHealth programs could become more accessible and personalized. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a personalized mHealth-anchored intervention program in improving glycemic control and enhancing care experience in diabetes management. The program was coincidentally implemented during the national-level lockdown for COVID-19 in Singapore, allowing for a timely study of the use of mHealth for chronic disease management. METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes were enrolled from the Singapore Armed Forces and offered a 3-month intervention program in addition to the usual care they received. The program was standardized to include (1) in-person initial consultation with a clinical dietitian; (2) in-person review with a diabetes specialist doctor; (3) 1 continuous glucose monitoring device; (4) access to the mobile app for dietary intake and physical activity tracking, and communication via messaging with the dietitian and doctor; and (5) context-sensitive digital health coaching over the mobile app. Medical support was rendered to the patients on an as-needed basis when they required advice on adjustment of medications. Measurements of weight, height, and glycated hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) were conducted at 2 in-person visits at the start and end of the program. At the end of the program, patients were asked to complete a short acceptability feedback survey to understand the motivation for joining the program, their satisfaction, and suggestions for improvement. RESULTS: Over a 4-week recruitment period, 130 individuals were screened, the enrollment target of 30 patients was met, and 21 patients completed the program and were included in the final analyses; 9 patients were lost to follow-up (full data were not available for the final analyses). There were no differences in the baseline characteristics between patients who were included and excluded from the final analyses (age category: P=.23; gender: P=.21; ethnicity: P>.99; diabetes status category: P=.52, medication adjustment category: P=.65; HbA(1c) category: P=.69; BMI: P>.99). The 21 patients who completed the study rated a mean of 9.0 out of 10 on the Likert scale for both satisfaction questions. For the Yes-No question on benefit of the program, all of the patients selected “Yes.” Mean HbA(1c) decreased from 7.6% to 7.0% (P=.004). There were no severe hypoglycemia events (glucose level <3.0 mmol/L) reported. Mean weight decreased from 76.8 kg to 73.9 kg (P<.001), a mean decrease of 3.5% from baseline weight. Mean BMI decreased from 27.8 kg/m(2) to 26.7 kg/m(2) (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The personalized mHealth program was feasible, acceptable, and produced significant reductions in HbA(1c) (P=.004) and body weight (P<.001) in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Such mHealth programs could overcome challenges posed to chronic disease management by COVID-19, including disruptions to in-person health care access.","Ang, Ian Yi Han; Tan, Kyle Xin Quan; Tan, Clive; Tan, Chiew Hoon; Kwek, James Wei Ming; Tay, Joanne; Toh, Sue Anne",JMIR Diabetes,407,16

To understand this decline, a national survey of fourth-year US allopathic medical students was conducted to assess experiences, knowledge, and attitudes of pathology and factors that impact specialty choice. Participating in a separate pathology course did not increase the probability of choosing pathology. Experiences significantly associated with choosing pathology included clinical or research opportunities in pathology during the last 2 years of medical school, autopsy observation/participation, and participation in pathology interest groups. Many respondents felt they were not sufficiently exposed to pathology to consider it as a specialty. Those who considered pathology but did not choose it were less likely to report understanding the activities of pathologists and being recruited by pathology faculty and more likely to express a preference for more direct patient contact as compared to those entering pathology. In general, respondents agreed that pathology has a good work–life balance and a satisfying degree of intellectual challenge. On the other hand, respondents generally agreed that information on social media and perception of the pathology job market do not seem to be positive and few agreed that pathology is a highly regarded specialty.

However, a remaining challenge is to develop an analytical framework that can test hypotheses about the effect of environmental variables on pathogen spatial spread. Recent phylogeographic approaches can reconstruct the history of virus dispersal from sampled viral genomes and infer the locations of ancestral infections. Such methods provide a unique source of spatio-temporal information, and are exploited here. RESULTS: We present and apply a new statistical framework that combines genomic and geographic data to test the impact of environmental variables on the mode and tempo of pathogen dispersal during emerging epidemics. First, the spatial history of an emerging pathogen is estimated using standard phylogeographic methods. The inferred dispersal path for each phylogenetic lineage is then assigned a “weight” using environmental data (e.g. altitude, land cover). Next, tests measure the association between each environmental variable and lineage movement. A randomisation procedure is used to assess statistical confidence and we validate this approach using simulated data. We apply our new framework to a set of gene sequences from an epidemic of rabies virus in North American raccoons. We test the impact of six different environmental variables on this epidemic and demonstrate that elevation is associated with a slower rabies spread in a natural population. CONCLUSION: This study shows that it is possible to integrate genomic and environmental data in order to test hypotheses concerning the mode and tempo of virus dispersal during emerging epidemics.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and effectiveness of SIJF using a 3D-printed TTI. METHODS: Fifty-one subjects with carefully diagnosed SIJ dysfunction underwent SIJF with 3D TTI. Subjects completed pain, disability and quality of life questionnaires at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Functional tests were performed in the clinic at each visit. Pelvic CT scans were independently evaluated for radiolucency, bridging bone and other endpoints. RESULTS: Ninety percent had 12-month follow-up. Dysfunction due to pain (Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]) decreased from 52.8 at baseline to 27.9 at 12 months (p<.0001 for change, p=.004 for non-inferiority primary hypothesis). SIJ pain scores improved from 78 preoperatively to 21 at 12-month follow-up (P<.0001). Ninety-six percent experienced an improvement of 20 points or more in VAS SIJ pain by month 12. The percentage of subjects reporting minimal difficulty performing physical activities typically impaired by back/SIJ pain improved significantly for all activities. The proportion of subjects taking opioids for SIJ pain decreased from 57% to 22%. Three physical function tests improved markedly from baseline to 1 year. Positive radiographic findings were observed, including a 70% and 77% rate of bone bridging observed at 6 and 12 months, respectively. There was no evidence of device breakage, migration or subsidence. CONCLUSION: In this prospective multicenter trial, SIJF with 3D-printed TTI markedly improved pain, disability and quality of life. Results are consistent with 3 prior prospective multicenter trials of a milled implant but suggest accelerated bony fusion with the newer implant. Physical function improved, and high rates of opioid cessation were observed.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted during the quarantine period. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) and the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) questionnaires were used to assess the study's outcomes. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to examine the difference in PA across resilience levels. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship between resilience and PA. Data were reported as medians and interquartile ranges. RESULTS: A sample of 1859 were included in the study (40% aged 26-35 yrs). The findings show that 85% of the respondents engaged in PA and 15% were physically inactive. The majority participated in moderate-intensity PA (71%). The median score was 3.50(0.85), which indicates a medium level of resilience. The positive correlation coefficient was shown between the average score of resilience and both walking (rs =0.01, p<0.001) and vigorous- intensity PA (rs =0.08, p=.007). Data did not show a significant correlation between moderate-intensity PA and resilience score. CONCLUSIONS: Greater emphasis on PA engagement after the period of quarantine is needed.

Transthoracic echocardiography is an ideal imaging modality for goal-directed assessment and optimization of cardiac function and volume status. Prone positioning, while demonstrated to improve oxygenation, offload the right ventricle, and reduce short-term mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome, has previously precluded transthoracic echocardiography on these patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability to perform focused transthoracic echocardiography examinations on acute respiratory distress syndrome patients in the prone position. DESIGN: We performed a cross-sectional study of critically ill patients hospitalized for acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus disease 2019. SETTING: This study was conducted in medical and surgical intensive units in a tertiary hospital. PATIENTS: We examined 27 mechanically ventilated and prone patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus disease 2019. Participants were examined at the time of enrollment in an ongoing clinical trial (NCT04306393), and no patients were excluded from echocardiographic analysis. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We were able to perform transthoracic echocardiography and obtain satisfactory images for quantitative assessment of right ventricular function in 24 out of 27 (88.9%) and left ventricular function in 26 out of 27 (96.3%) of patients in the prone position, including many who were obese and on high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (≥ 15 cm H(2)O). CONCLUSIONS: Transthoracic echocardiography can be performed at the prone patient’s bedside by critical care intensivists. These findings encourage the use of focused transthoracic echocardiography for goal-directed cardiac assessment in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients undergoing prone positioning.","Gibson, Lauren E.; Di Fenza, Raffaele; Berra, Lorenzo; Bittner, Edward A.; Chang, Marvin G.",Crit Care Explor,407,3

So far, neither effective vaccines nor approved antiviral therapeutics are currently available for the treatment of FIPV infection. Both human and animal CoVs shares similar functional proteins, particularly the 3CL protease (3CL(pro)), which plays the pivotal role on viral replication. We investigated the potential drug-liked compounds and their inhibitory interaction on the 3CL(pro) active sites of CoVs by the structural-bases virtual screening. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay revealed that three out of twenty-eight compounds could hamper FIPV 3CL(pro) activities with IC(50) of 3.57 ± 0.36 μM to 25.90 ± 1.40 μM, and Ki values of 2.04 ± 0.08 to 15.21 ± 1.76 μM, respectively. Evaluation of antiviral activity using cell-based assay showed that NSC629301 and NSC71097 could strongly inhibit the cytopathic effect and also reduced replication of FIPV in CRFK cells in all examined conditions with the low range of EC(50) (6.11 ± 1.90 to 7.75 ± 0.48 μM and 1.99 ± 0.30 to 4.03 ± 0.60 μM, respectively), less than those of ribavirin and lopinavir.

It examines the behavior of a subindex reflecting bank shares' prices against the main WIG index WIG and 14 sector subindices. The authors identify groups of banks with different investors' responses. They also classify banks into separate groups on the basis of changes in the fundamental indicators describing their economic and financial performance. The study concentrates mainly on the verification of the stability of this attribution, explaining reasons for its modifications over time. Purpose of the article: To identify the characteristics of bank clusters determining different capital market responses to their listed shares and to explain the reasons for volatility in investors' behavior within the analyzed period. Methods: The methodology of the research can be described in three areas. The first is the statistical analysis with the emphasis on the use of a quarter range to capture changes in the volatility of share prices. the second area is the clustering k-means method based on the interpolated from quarterly to daily - measures of the hank's financial condition. This mathematical approach is a novelty in finance and economics. The last, third, area is forecasting with the use of linear regression analysis, which is the key factor in determining the abnormal rate f return. The indicated areas are combined through a generally understood correlation analysis. Findings & value added: Large retail banks have been less affected compared to medium-sized ones with relatively rich corporate portfolios. The initial market reaction reflected concern about the resistance to the crisis of poorly capitalized banks with mean liquidity buffers. Upon the announcement of government support, investors' approach to the shares of banks of differentiated economic and financial performance conformed accordingly. These findings are valuable in the long term especially from the perspective of supervision authorities' policy during external shocks. The presented study suggests designing flexible and tailor-made regulatory approach aligned with the defined bank clusters. Its value added also consists in proposing a new method of analysis, combining interpolation and automatic clustering, which has proved to be adequate for the study of a bank's financial condition based on daily frequency data. Furthermore. assuming the same length of the estimation window, a close relationship is shown between the results of clustering and the forecasts based on different measures of rates of return.","Bernardelli, M.; Korzeb, Z.; Niedziolka, P.",Oeconomia Copernicana,407,16

It can also significantly affect the results of phylogenetic analyses and the inference of evolutionary rates. The detection of recombination from samples of sequencing data is a very challenging problem, and is further complicated for SARS-CoV-2 by its relatively slow accumulation of genetic diversity. The extent to which recombination is ongoing for SARS-CoV-2 is not yet resolved. To address this, we use a parsimony-based method to reconstruct possible genealogical histories for samples of SARS-CoV-2 sequences, which enables us to pinpoint specific recombination events that could have generated the data. We propose a statistical framework for disentangling the effects of recurrent mutation from recombination in the history of a sample, and hence provide a way of estimating the probability that ongoing recombination is present. We apply this to samples of sequencing data collected in England and South Africa, and find evidence of ongoing recombination.","Ignatieva, Anastasia; Hein, Jotun; Jenkins, Paul A.",bioRxiv,407,28

This study aimed to describe the characteristics of this infection among individuals with polyhandicap. Method: This was a retrospective observational study. Polyhandicap was defined by the combination of motor deficiency, profound mental retardation, and age at onset of cerebral lesion younger than 6 years. A positive COVID-19 status was considered for patients with a positive COVID-19 laboratory test result, or patients presenting with compatible symptoms and living in an institution or at home with other patients or relatives who had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. Data collection included sociodemographic data, clinical and paraclinical characteristics, as well as the management and treatment for COVID-19 infection. Results: We collected 98 cases, with a sex ratio of 0.98 and a mean age of 38.5 years (3 months to 73 years). COVID-19 infection was paucisymptomatic in 46% of patients, 20.6% of patients presented with dyspnea, while the most frequent extra-respiratory symptoms were digestive (26.5%) and neurological changes (24.5%); 18 patients required hospital admission, four adults died. The mean duration of infection was longer for adults than for children, and the proportion of taste and smell disorders was higher in older patients. Conclusion: These findings suggest that PLH persons often develop paucisymptomatic forms of COVID-19 infection, although they may also experience severe outcomes, including death. Clinicians should be aware that COVID-19 symptoms in PLH persons are often extra-respiratory signs, mostly digestive and neurologic, which may help in the earlier identification of COVID-19 infection in this particular population of patients.","Rousseau, M.-C.; Hully, M.; Milh, M.; Juzeau, D.; Pollez, B.; Peudenier, S.; Bahi Buisson, N.; Gautheron, V.; Chabrol, B.; de Villemeur, T.

OBJECTIVES: We assessed of the risk of illness due to airborne SARS-CoV-2 particles from breathing, speaking, singing, coughing, and sneezing in indoor environments. METHODS: A risk assessment model, AirCoV2, for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 particles in aerosol droplets was developed. Previously published data on droplets expelled by breathing, speaking, singing, coughing, and sneezing by an infected person were used as inputs. Scenarios encompassed virus concentration, exposure time, and ventilation. Newly collected data of virus RNA copies in mucus from patients are presented. RESULTS: The expelled volume of aerosols was highest for a sneeze, followed by a cough, singing, speaking, and breathing. After 20 min of exposure, at [Formula: see text] RNA copies/mL in mucus, all mean illness risks were largely estimated to be below 0.001, except for the “high” sneeze scenario. At virus concentrations above [Formula: see text] RNA copies/mL, and after 2 h of exposure, in the high and “low” sneeze scenarios, the high cough scenario and the singing scenario, risks exceeded 0.01 and may become very high, whereas the low coughing scenario, the high and low speaking scenarios and the breathing scenario remained below 0.1. After 2 h of exposure, singing became the second highest risk scenario. One air exchange per hour reduced risk of illness by about a factor of 2. Six air exchanges per hour reduced risks of illness by a factor of 8–13 for the sneeze and cough scenarios and by a factor of 4–9 for the other scenarios. DISCUSSION: The large variation in the volume of expelled aerosols is discussed. The model calculations indicated that SARS-CoV-2 transmission via aerosols outside of the [Formula: see text] social distancing norm can occur. Virus concentrations in aerosols and/or the amount of expelled aerosol droplets need to be high for substantial transmission via this route.

RESULTS: Thirty (13.1%) influenza samples screened positive for the presence of 31 viral copathogens. The most prominent copathogens included rhinovirus (61.3%), and coronaviruses (16.1%). Median clinical severity of both monoinfected and co-infected groups were 1. Patients coinfected with rhinovirus tended to have lower clinical severity (median 0), whereas non rhinovirus co-infections had substantially higher clinical severity (median 2). No difference in H1N1 viral load was observed between co-infected and mono infected groups. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses co-infect patients with influenza disease. Patients coinfected with rhinovirus had less severe disease while non-rhinovirus co-infections were associated with substantially higher severity without changes in influenza viral titer.","Esper, Frank P.; Spahlinger, Timothy; Zhou, Lan",Journal of Infection,407,1

The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The presence of myocarditis, cardiac arrest, and acute heart failure in COVID-19 patients suggests the existence of a relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiac disease. The Notch signalling is a major regulator of cardiovascular function and it is also implicated in several biological processes mediating viral infections. In this report we discuss the possibility to target Notch signalling to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and interfere with the progression of COVID-19- associated heart and lungs disease.","Rizzo, Paola; Vieceli Dalla Sega, Francesco; Fortini, Francesca; Marracino, Luisa; Rapezzi, Claudio; Ferrari, Roberto",Basic Res Cardiol,407,16

Non-major science students make up an important, yet understudied, part of our public, given that they constitute tomorrow’s voters, workers, consumers, and policy-makers. Expecting that non-majors may benefit from a module connecting COVID-19 to community education, we implemented a novel E-service-learning module in light of the transition from an in-person course to an online platform. Our 4-week module included expert-led lectures, assigned digital infographics about COVID-19 safety precautions, and a required post-reflection assignment summarizing their learning gains. Out of 112 enrolled students, 87 consented to have their reflections analyzed and 8 students chose to participate in additional one-on-one online interviews. In an effort to determine which parts of our module garnered the most student commentary, we grouped post-reflection and interview data into four categories: service-learning infographic, service-learning guest lectures, information on COVID-19, and the broader implications of COVID-19. While 13% of students explicitly referenced infographics in their reflections, a far greater proportion (37%) explicitly referenced learning gains related to the expert-led lectures. Based on these findings, we encourage other educators to continue to explore the impact of E-service-learning content and assignments to help maximize learning in an online classroom environment during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Adkins-Jablonsky, Sarah; Fleming, Ryleigh; Esteban, Marco; Bucio, Diana; Morris, J.

Scientists have been investigating a host of drugs that may be rechanneled to fight this malaise. Thus, in this current computational study we carried out molecular docking experiments to assess the bridging potentials of some commercial drugs such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, nafamostat, camostat, famotidine, umifenovir, nitazoxanide, ivermectin, and fluvoxamine at the interface between human ACE2 and the coronavirus spike glycoprotein complex. This is aimed at ascertaining the ability of these drugs to bridge and prevent the complexing of these two proteins. The crystal structure of human ACE2 and the coronavirus spike glycoprotein complex was retrieved from protein database, while the selected drugs were retrieved from PubChem data base. The proteins and drugs were prepared for docking using Cresset Flare software. The docking was completed via AutoDock Vina module in Python Prescription software. The best hit drugs with each receptor were selected and their molecular interactions were analyzed using BIOVIA’s Discovery Studio 2020. The best hit compounds on the human ACE2 were the lopinavir (-10.1 kcal/mol), ritonavir (-8.9 kcal/mol), and nafamostat (-8.7 kcal/mol). Ivermectin, nafamostat, and camostat with binding energy values -9.0 kcal/mol, -7.8 kcal/mol, and -7.4 kcal/mol respectively were the hit drugs on the coronavirus spike glycoprotein. Nafamostat showed a dual bridging potential against ACE2 and spike glycoprotein, and could therefore be a promising lead compound in the prevention and control of this disease.","Duru, Chidi Edbert; Umar, Haruna Isiyaku Umar; Duru, Ijeoma Akunna; Enenebeaku, Uchechi Emmanuela; Ngozi-Olehi, Lynda Chioma; Enyoh, Christian Ebere",Environ Anal Health Toxicol,407,7

We previously predicted antivirals (atazanavir, remdesivir and lopinavir/ritonavir) and non-antiviral drugs (tiotropium and rapamycin) that may inhibit the replication complex of SARS-CoV-2 using our molecular transformer–drug target interaction (MT–DTI) deep-learning-based drug–target affinity prediction model. In this study, we dissected molecular pathways upregulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells by analyzing an RNA-seq data set with various bioinformatics approaches, such as gene ontology, protein–protein interaction-based network and gene set enrichment analyses. The results indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 infection strongly activates TNF and NFκB-signaling pathways through significant upregulation of the TNF, IL1B, IL6, IL8, NFKB1, NFKB2 and RELB genes. In addition to these pathways, lung fibrosis, keratinization/cornification, rheumatoid arthritis, and negative regulation of interferon-gamma production pathways were also significantly upregulated. We observed that these pathologic features of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to those observed in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Intriguingly, tiotropium, as predicted by MT–DTI, is currently used as a therapeutic intervention in COPD patients. Treatment with tiotropium has been shown to improve pulmonary function by alleviating airway inflammation. Accordingly, a literature search summarized that tiotropium reduced expressions of IL1B, IL6, IL8, RELA, NFKB1 and TNF in vitro or in vivo, and many of them have been known to be deregulated in COPD patients. These results suggest that COVID-19 is similar to an acute mode of COPD caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and therefore tiotropium may be effective for COVID-19 patients.","Kang, Keunsoo; Kim, Hoo Hyun; Choi, Yoonjung",Viruses,407,22

In this study, we examined the prevalence of parental burnout in 42 countries (17,409 parents; 71% mothers; M(age) = 39.20) and showed that the prevalence of parental burnout varies dramatically across countries. Analyses of cultural values revealed that individualistic cultures, in particular, displayed a noticeably higher prevalence and mean level of parental burnout. Indeed, individualism plays a larger role in parental burnout than either economic inequalities across countries, or any other individual and family characteristic examined so far, including the number and age of children and the number of hours spent with them. These results suggest that cultural values in Western countries may put parents under heightened levels of stress.

The spike protein of MERS-CoV (MERS-S) facilitates viral entry into host cells, which depends on activation of MERS-S by cellular proteases. Proteolytic activation of MERS-S during viral uptake into target cells has been demonstrated. However, it is unclear whether MERS-S is also cleaved during S protein synthesis in infected cells and whether cleavage is required for MERS-CoV infectivity. Here, we show that MERS-S is processed by proprotein convertases in MERS-S–transfected and MERS-CoV–infected cells and that several RXXR motifs located at the border between the surface and transmembrane subunit of MERS-S are required for efficient proteolysis. However, blockade of proprotein convertases did not impact MERS-S–dependent transduction of target cells expressing high amounts of the viral receptor, DPP4, and did not modulate MERS-CoV infectivity. These results show that MERS-S is a substrate for proprotein convertases and demonstrate that processing by these enzymes is dispensable for S protein activation. Efforts to inhibit MERS-CoV infection by targeting host cell proteases should therefore focus on enzymes that process MERS-S during viral uptake into target cells.","Gierer, Stefanie; Müller, Marcel A.; Heurich, Adeline; Ritz, Daniel; Springstein, Benjamin L.; Karsten, Christina B.; Schendzielorz, Alexander; Gnirß, Kerstin; Drosten, Christian; Pöhlmann, Stefan",J Infect Dis,407,24

Like many other infectious diseases influenza pandemics are usually of short, sharp duration. Human coronavirus is a less regularly recurring infectious disease. The human coronavirus pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19) has presented with seemingly high transmissibility and led to extraordinary socioeconomic disruption due to severe preventative measures by governments. To understand and compare these events, epidemiological and economic models are linked to capture the transmission of a pandemic from regional populations to regional economies and then across regional economies. In contrast to past pandemics, COVID-19 is likely to be of longer duration and more severe in its economic effects given the greater uncertainty surrounding its nature. The analysis indicates how economies are likely to be affected due to the risk-modifying behaviour in the form of preventative measures taken in response to the latest novel pandemic virus.","Verikios, George",Socioecon Plann Sci,407,5

PFT measures spirometry, lung volumes, and carbon monoxide diffusion capacity of the lung (DLCO). The results are usually interpreted by the clinicians using discrete numeric data according to published guidelines. PFT interpretations by clinicians, however, are known to have inter-rater variability and the inaccuracy can impact patient care. This variability may be caused by unfamiliarity of the guidelines, lack of training, inadequate understanding of lung physiology, or simply mental lapses. A rules-based automated interpretation system can recapitulate expert’s pattern recognition capability and decrease errors. ML can also be used to analyze continuous data or the graphics, including the flow-volume loop, the DLCO and the nitrogen washout curves. These analyses can discover novel physiological biomarkers. In the era of wearables and telehealth, particularly with the COVID-19 pandemic restricting PFTs to be done in the clinical laboratories, ML can also be used to combine mobile spirometry results with an individual’s clinical profile to deliver precision medicine. There are, however, hurdles in the development and commercialization of the ML-assisted PFT interpretation programs, including the need for high quality representative data, the existence of different formats for data acquisition and sharing in PFT software by different vendors, and the need for collaboration amongst clinicians, biomedical engineers, and information technologists. Hurdles notwithstanding, the new developments would represent significant advances that could be the future of PFT, the oldest test still in use in clinical medicine.","Giri, Paresh C.; Chowdhury, Anand M.; Bedoya, Armando; Chen, Hengji; Lee, Hyun Suk; Lee, Patty; Henriquez, Craig; MacIntyre, Neil R.; Huang, Yuh-Chin T.",Front Physiol,407,16

Baseline characteristics of patients, interventions, and overall outcomes of IHCAs during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared with IHCAs in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: There were 125 IHCAs during a 2.5-month period at our hospital during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with 117 IHCAs in all of 2019. IHCAs during the COVID-19 pandemic occurred more often on general medicine wards than in intensive care units (46% versus 33%; 19% versus 60% in 2019; P<0.001), were overall shorter in duration (median time of 11 minutes [8.5–26.5] versus 15 minutes [7.0–20.0], P=0.001), led to fewer endotracheal intubations (52% versus 85%, P<0.001), and had overall worse survival rates (3% versus 13%; P=0.007) compared with IHCAs before the COVID-19 pandemic.

We performed a systematic review of the literature to summarise the evidence. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Ovid and WEB of Science databases, major organisation websites and reference lists of published studies were searched. The quality of studies was assessed using the STROBE tool (von Elm et al., 1) Individual study data was analyzed using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals as a measure of association between exposure (co-infection), patient outcome and results summarised using forest plots and tables RESULTS: Nineteen (19) studies from all over the world were identified and included in the review. Most of the studies 73.7% (14/19) recruited children ≤6 years old. Evidence on the role of co-infection in increasing disease severity was inconclusive. In five out of eight studies, co-infection significantly increased risk of admission to general ward (OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.3 - 4.4, p = 0.005; OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1 - 7.7, P = 0.04; OR: 3.1, 95% CI: 2.0 - 5.1, p = <0.001; OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.7-3.4, p = <0.0001 and OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1 - 5.1, p = 0.34), one found it did not (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.4 - 0.9, p = 0.02) and the other 2 had insignificant results. Similarly on risk of admission to ICU, some studies found that co-infection significantly increased risk of admission to ICU (OR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.4 - 5.9, p = 0.004 and OR: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.7 - 5.6, p = <0.0001), whereas others did not (OR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.05 - 0.75, p = 0.02 and OR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.2 - 0.6, p = <0.0001). There was no evidence for or against respiratory virus co-infections and risk of bronchiolitis or pneumonia. CONCLUSION: The influence of co-infections on severe viral respiratory disease is still unclear. The observed conflict in outcomes could be because they were conducted in different seasons and covered different years and periods. It could also be due to bias towards the null, especially in studies where only crude analysis was conducted. Future studies should employ stratified analysis.","Goka, Edward Anthony; Vallely, Pamela J.; Mutton, Kenneth J.; Klapper, Paul E.",Paediatr Respir Rev,407,16

Two additional BALB/c mice were trained to discriminate between the presentation of air and the presentation of either vanillin or propionic acid. Following criterion performance, each mouse received an additional 2000 trials of overtraining. At completion of overtraining one mouse from the propanol and propyl acetate groups were allocated as untreated.

In contrast, inoculated animals varied in their capacity to discriminate between air and odorant. Five of the six inoculated mice showed massive disruption of the olfactory bulb, including death of mitral cells; the other was more modestly affected. In addition, the density of innervation of the olfactory mucosa by substance P-containing trigeminal fibers is also affected by inoculation. Those mice that remained anosmic to the training odorants had the most severe reduction in mitral cell number and substance P fiber density among the inoculated animals.","Youngentob, Steven L.; Schwob, James E.; Saha, Sucharita; Manglapus, Glen; Jubelt, Burk",Chem Senses,407,16

Now, a turning point has been reached regarding the interactions between health and the built environment and the contributions made by urban planning and other built environment disciplines. In the context of the post-pandemic city, there is a need to develop a health-led temporary urbanism agenda than can be implemented in various settings both in the Global South and North. RECENT FINDINGS: Health-led temporary urbanism requires a reinterrogation of current models of urban development including designing multifunctional spaces in urban environments that provide sites for temporary urbanism-related activities.

Methods: : Consecutive patients planned for emergency ophthalmic surgeries after ocular trauma were subjected to naso-oropharyngeal RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. Laboratory-confirmed cases were enrolled for the study. During surgery, 0.1 mL aqueous and vitreous each was aspirated. The vitreous tap was collected on clinical suspicion of endophthalmitis. RT-PCR test was used to detect SARS-COV-2 nucleotide in the samples. Cycle threshold (Ct) for E gene of ≤35 along with confirmatory results on one of the two target genes (RdRp or ORF1b) was considered as positive. Results: : One hundred and thirty two patients were found positive on naso-oropharyngeal RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 preoperatively. Seven patients with ocular trauma were studied. The mean age was 31.8 years. There were six male and one female patient. Two patients had symptoms of mild COVID-19 disease and the rest were asymptomatic. The mean Ct value of the E gene on naso-oropharyngeal RT-PCR was 23.14 ± 4.7. Corneal and corneoscleral laceration repair was done in five patients, intracorneal wooden foreign body was removed in one patient, and injection of intravitreal antibiotics was done in one patient. Aqueous and vitreous tap was collected in 7 and 5 patients, respectively. None of the aqueous or vitreous samples was found positive for SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: : SARS-CoV-2 was not detected by RT-PCR in aqueous or vitreous humor in this pilot study. Future studies with a larger sample size are needed to further explore the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in intraocular fluids.","Hada, Maya; Khilnani, Kamlesh; Vyas, Nitya; Chouhan, Jugal Kishore; Dharawat, Kulveer S; Bhandari, Sudhir; Tripathy, Koushik",Indian J Ophthalmol,407,11

The recent emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 in China, which causes COVID-19 disease in humans, and its current spread to several countries, leading to the first pandemic in history to be caused by a coronavirus, highlights the significance of zoonotic viral diseases. Rift Valley fever, rabies, West Nile, chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Ebola, and influenza viruses among many other viruses have been reported from different African countries. The paucity of information, lack of knowledge, limited resources, and climate change, coupled with cultural traditions make the African continent a hotspot for vector-borne and zoonotic viral diseases, which may spread globally. Currently, there is no information available on the status of virus diseases in Africa. This systematic review highlights the available information about viral diseases, including zoonotic and vector-borne diseases, reported in Africa. The findings will help us understand the trend of emerging and re-emerging virus diseases within the African continent. The findings recommend active surveillance of viral diseases and strict implementation of One Health measures in Africa to improve human public health and reduce the possibility of potential pandemics due to zoonotic viruses.","Chauhan, Ravendra P.; Dessie, Zelalem G.; Noreddin, Ayman; El Zowalaty, Mohamed E.",Pathogens,407,21

METHODS: We applied the summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) method integrating genome-wide association study (GWAS) for periodontitis and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data to identify genes that were pleiotropically associated with periodontitis. We performed separate SMR analysis using CAGE eQTL data and GTEx eQTL data. SMR analysis were done for participants of European and East Asian ancestries, separately. RESULTS: We identified multiple genes showing pleiotropic association with periodontitis in participants of European ancestry and participants of East Asian ancestry.

METHODS The study enrolled 39 patients who had fully recovered from COVID-19 and 40 healthy controls. OCT-A image acquisitions were obtained using AngioVue software (version 2017.1.0.151) and the RTVue XR Avanti imaging system (Optovue Inc., Fremont, CA, USA). Nonflow area in the superficial capillary plexus (SCP), foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area in the whole retinal vasculature, FAZ perimeter, acircularity index of FAZ, and foveal density were automatically obtained with the FAZ assessment tool. Vessel density (VD) at the SCP and deep capillary plexus were also measured. RESULTS Compared to the control group, the nonflow area and the FAZ area in the whole retina was greater in the COVID-19 group; however no statistically significant difference was observed (p > 0.05 respectively). As for vessel densities, all superficial parafoveal VD parameters were considerably higher in the COVID-19 group compared to the control group (p < 0.05 respectively). Despite the fact that the vessel densities in the remaining zones were lower in the COVID-19 group, those differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05 respectively). CONCLUSION VD at the parafoveal area of the SCP was significantly higher among patients in the late post-recovery period of COVID-19 disease compared to healthy controls. These findings show the impact of COVID-19 on the retinal microvasculature and its possible role as a risk factor for the development of ocular diseases.","Aydemir, Emre; Aydemir, Gozde Aksoy; Atesoglu, Halil Ibrahim; Goker, Yasin Sakir; Ozcelik, Kazim Caglar; Kiziltoprak, Hasan",Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,407,16

With no effective treatment yet, vaccination seems to be the most effective method of prevention. Recently developed vaccines have been approved for emergency use only and are currently applied to large populations. Considering both the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of autoimmune/autoinflammatory rheumatological diseases (AIIRDs) and the immunosuppressive drugs used in treatment, vaccination for COVID-19 deserves special attention in such patients. In this article, we aimed to give simple messages to the clinicians for COVID-19 vaccination in patients with AIIRDs based upon the current evidence regarding the use of other vaccines in this patient group. For this purpose, we conducted a “Pubmed search” using the following keywords: Influenza, Hepatitis B, Pneumococcal, and Shingles vaccines and the frequently used conventional and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Likewise, an additional search was performed for the COVID-19 immunization in patients with AIIRDs and considering such drugs. In summary, patients with AIIRDs should also be vaccinated against COVID-19, preferably when disease activity is under control and when there is no concurrent infection. Low-degree immunosuppression does not appear to decrease antibody responses to vaccines. Ideally, vaccinations should be done before the initiation of any biological DMARDs. Patients receiving rituximab should be vaccinated at least 4 weeks before or 6 months after treatment. Since tofacitinib may also reduce antibody responses, especially in combination with methotrexate, it may be appropriate to discontinue this drug before vaccination and to restart after 14 days of immunization.","Soy, Mehmet; Keser, Gökhan; Atagunduz, Pamir; Mutlu, Melek Yalçin; Gunduz, Alper; Koybaşi, Gizem; Bes, Cemal",Clin Rheumatol,407,22

However, it fails to induce secretory immunoglobulin (Ig) A (SIgA) in mucosal tissues and is poor in inducing Th1 and cell-mediated immunity. Alum stimulates interleukin 1 (IL-1) and the recruitment of myeloid cells, including neutrophils. We investigated whether neutrophil elastase regulates the adjuvanticity of alum, and whether a strategy targeting neutrophil elastase could improve responses to injected vaccines. Mice coadministered a pharmacological inhibitor of elastase, or lacking elastase, developed high-affinity serum IgG and IgA antibodies after immunization with alum-adsorbed protein vaccines, including the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2). These mice also developed broader antigen-specific CD4(+) T cell responses, including high Th1 and T follicular helper (Tfh) responses. Interestingly, in the absence of elastase activity, mucosal SIgA responses were induced after systemic immunization with alum as adjuvant. Importantly, lack or suppression of elastase activity enhanced the magnitude of anti–SARS-CoV-2 spike subunit 1 (S1) antibodies, and these antibodies reacted with the same epitopes of spike 1 protein as sera from COVID-19 patients. Therefore, suppression of neutrophil elastase could represent an attractive strategy for improving the efficacy of alum-based injected vaccines for the induction of broad immunity, including mucosal immunity.","Kim, Eunsoo; Attia, Zayed; Woodfint, Rachel M.; Zeng, Cong; Kim, Sun Hee; Steiner, Haley E.; Shukla, Rajni Kant; Liyanage, Namal P.

A range of frontline government employees work to protect public health, providing services for people engaged in animal-based livelihoods (livestock owners and butchers), and enforcing meat safety and food premises standards. In contrast to literature which emphasises the inadequacy of extension support and food safety policy implementation in low- and middle-income countries, this paper foregrounds the ‘street-level diplomacy’ deployed by frontline actors operating in challenging contexts. METHODS: This research is based on semi-structured interviews with 61 government employees, including livestock extension officers/meat inspectors and health officers, across 10 randomly-selected rural and urban wards. RESULTS: Frontline actors combined formal and informal strategies including the leveraging of formal policy texts and relationships with other state employees, remaining flexible and recognising that poverty constrained people’s ability to comply with health regulations. They emphasised the need to work with livestock keepers and butchers to build their knowledge to self-regulate and to work collaboratively to ensure meat safety. Remaining adaptive and being hesitant to act punitively unless absolutely necessary cultivated trust and positive relations, making those engaged in animal-based livelihoods more open to learning from and cooperating with extension officers and inspectors. This may result in higher levels of meat safety than might be the case if frontline actors stringently enforced regulations. CONCLUSION: The current tendency to view frontline actors’ partial enforcement of meat safety regulations as a failure obscures the creative and proactive ways in which they seek to ensure meat safety in a context of limited resources. Their application of ‘street-level diplomacy’ enables them to be sensitive to local socio-economic realities, to respect local social norms and expectations and to build support for health safety interventions when necessary. More explicitly acknowledging the role of trust and positive state-society relations and the diplomatic skills deployed by frontline actors as a formal part of their inspection duties offers new perspectives and enhanced understandings on the complicated nature of their work and what might be done to support them.

At that time, there were reports of heroic acts among professionals who cared for these patients, whose bravery and professionalism were highly praised. However, there are concerns about changes in new generation of nursing professionals. OBJECTIVE We aimed to examine the attitude of nursing students, should they be faced with severe acute respiratory syndrome patients during their future work. RESEARCH DESIGN A questionnaire survey was carried out to examine the attitude among final-year nursing students to three ethical areas, namely, duty of care, resource allocation, and collateral damage. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS This study was carried out in accordance with the requirements and recommendations of the Central Research and Ethics Committee, School of Health Sciences at Caritas Institute of Higher Education. FINDINGS Complete responses from 102 subjects were analyzed. The overwhelming majority (96.1%) did not agree to participate in the intubation of severe acute respiratory syndrome patients if protective measures, that is, N95 mask and gown, were not available. If there were insufficient N95 masks for all the medical, nursing, and allied health workers in the hospital (resource allocation), 37.3% felt that the distribution of N95 masks should be by casting lot, while the rest disagreed. When asked about collateral damage, more than three-quarters (77.5%) said that severe acute respiratory syndrome patients should be admitted to intensive care unit. There was sex difference in nursing students' attitude toward severe acute respiratory syndrome care during pregnancy and influence of age in understanding intensive care unit care for these patients. Interestingly, 94.1% felt that there should be a separate intensive care unit for severe acute respiratory syndrome patients. CONCLUSION As infection control practice and isolation facilities improved over the years, relevant knowledge and nursing ethical issues related to infectious diseases should become part of nursing education and training programs, especially in preparation for outbreaks of infectious diseases or distress.","Kam, Joseph Km; Chan, Eric; Lee, Albert; Wei, Vivian Wi; Kwok, Kin On; Lui, Dominic; Yuen, Robert Kn",Nursing ethics,407,1

Female gender, steroid treatment, and using the local newspaper as a primary source of information were independently associated with expressed fear of infection in SOT recipients. Younger age and more recent transplantation correlated with concerns of severe COVID‐19 expressed by patients and with concerns of worse medical care expressed by household controls. One third of the patients expressed fear that immunosuppression could worsen COVID‐19 but only 15% used the transplantation center as a source of information.

Both ANIm and ANIi decreased significantly during tracheal suction with no difference between positions, whereas BIS showed no significant variation within time and between groups. The median [Q1–Q3] ANIm value decreased from 87 [68–98] to 79 [63–09] in supine position and from 79 [63–95] to 78 [66–98] in prone position 2 min after the beginning of tracheal suction.

So far, there has been no defined consensus on how to control infection across centres caring for patients with PCD. Within the BEAT-PCD network, COST Action and ERS CRC together with the ERN-Lung PCD core a first initiative has now been taken towards creating such a consensus statement. METHODS: A multidisciplinary international PCD expert panel was set up to create a consensus statement for infection prevention and control (IP&C) for PCD, covering diagnostic microbiology, infection prevention for specific pathogens considered indicated for treatment and segregation aspects. Using a modified Delphi process, consensus to a statement demanded at least 80% agreement within the PCD expert panel group. Patient organisation representatives were involved throughout the process. RESULTS: We present a consensus statement on 20 IP&C statements for PCD including suggested actions for microbiological identification, indications for treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia and nontuberculous mycobacteria and suggested segregation aspects aimed to minimise patient-to-patient transmission of infections whether in-hospital, in PCD clinics or wards, or out of hospital at meetings between people with PCD. The statement also includes segregation aspects adapted to the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. CONCLUSION: The first ever international consensus statement on IP&C intended specifically for PCD is presented and is targeted at clinicians managing paediatric and adult patients with PCD, microbiologists, patient organisations and not least the patients and their families.","Marthin, June K.; Lucas, Jane S.; Boon, Mieke; Casaulta, Carmen; Crowley, Suzanne; Destouches, Damien M.S.; Eber, Ernst; Escribano, Amparo; Haarman, Eric; Hogg, Claire; Maitre, Bernard; Marsh, Gemma; Martinu, Vendula; Moreno-Galdó, Antonio; Mussaffi, Huda; Omran, Heymut; Pohunek, Petr; Rindlisbacher, Bernhard; Robinson, Phil; Snijders, Deborah; Walker, Woolf T.; Yiallouros, Panayiotis; Johansen, Helle Krogh; Nielsen, Kim G.",ERJ Open Res,407,29

This paper introduces the Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered, Undetectable, and Deceased (SEIRUD) and Machine learning algorithm to predict and control COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia.This COVID-19 has initiated many methods, such as cloud computing, edge-computing, IoT, artificial intelligence. The use of sensor devices has increased enormously. Similarly, several developments in solving the COVID-19 crisis have been used by IoT applications. The new technology relies on IoT variables and the roles of symptoms using wearable sensors to forecast cases of COVID-19. The working model involves wearable devices, occupational therapy, condition control, testing of cases, suspicious and IoT elements. Mathematical modeling is useful for understanding the fundamental principle of the transmission of COVID-19 and providing guidance for possible predictions. The method suggested predicts whether COVID-19 would expand or die in the long term in the population. The mathematical study results and related simulation are described here as a way of forecasting the progress and the possible end of the epidemic with three forms of scenarios: 'No Action,' 'Lockdowns and New Medicine.' The lock case slows it down the peak by minimizing infection and impacts area equality of the infected deformation. This study familiarizes the ideal protocol, which can support the Saudi population to breakdown spreading COVID-19 in an accurate and timely way.

Therefore, this review presents an analysis of the three principal non-ionic surfactants utilized in the manufacture of polymeric nanoparticles; polysorbates, poly(vinyl alcohol), and poloxamers. We included a section on general properties and uses and a comprehensive compilation of formulations with each principal non-ionic surfactant. Then, we highlight a section on the interaction of non-ionic surfactants with biological barriers to emphasize that the function of surfactants is not limited to stabilizing the dispersion of nanoparticles and has a broad impact on pharmacokinetics. Finally, the last section corresponds to a recommendation in the experimental approach for choosing a surfactant applying the systematic methodology of Quality by Design.","Cortés, Hernán; Hernández-Parra, Héctor; Bernal-Chávez, Sergio A.; Prado-Audelo, María L.

Vaccine acceptance decisions can be influenced by multiple factors and people may weigh these factors differently in decision making. The current study aimed to explore COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among college students in South Carolina and examine how they weigh these factors according to their COVID-19 vaccine acceptance levels (i.e. acceptance, hesitance, refusal). Online survey data were collected from 1062 college students in South Carolina between September and October 2020. Multinomial logistic regresssion was used to compare perceived importance of 12 factors affecting levels of vaccine acceptance, controlling for demographic variables. About 26.1% of participants reported they would definitely take COVID-19 vaccines when available. Compared to acceptance group, refusal and hesitance groups considered side effects and vaccine characteristics (e.g. where the vaccine is produced) as important. Hesitance group considered authoritative advice from school/college as important. Acceptance group considered authoritative advice from government/doctors and local availability of the vaccines and local availability of the vaccines as important. Our findings suggest relatively low vaccine acceptance among college students in South Carolina and different factors were considered in their vaccination decision according to their acceptance levels. Tailored vaccine promotion messages should address specific concerns among the refusal and hesitancy groups. Schools should attend to valid communication strategies in vaccine campaign since the hesitancy group considered school's advice as important. College health educators also need to pay attention to the refusal group who do not value duration of protection or authoritative advice as much as their counterparts in vaccine decision making.","Tam, Cheuk Chi; Qiao, Shan; Li, Xiaoming","Psychology, health & medicine",407,16

This study aims to evaluate the association of the TyG index with the severity and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: The study included a cohort of 151 patients with COVID-19 admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital in Wuhan. Regression models were used to investigate the association between TyG with severity and mortality of COVID-19. RESULTS: In this cohort, 39 (25.8%) patients had diabetes, 62 (41.1%) patients were severe cases, while 33 (22.0%) patients died in hospital. The TyG index levels were significantly higher in the severe cases and death group (mild vs. severe 8.7 ± 0.6 vs. 9.2 ± 0.6, P < 0.001; survivor vs. deceased 8.8 ± 0.6 vs. 9.3 ± 0.7, P < 0.001), respectively. The TyG index was significantly associated with an increased risk of severe case and mortality, after controlling for potential confounders (OR for severe case, 2.9, 95% CI 1.2–6.3, P = 0.007; OR for mortality, 2.9, 95% CI 1.2–6.7, P = 0.016). The associations were not statistically significant for further adjustment of inflammatory factors. CONCLUSION: TyG index was closely associated with the severity and morbidity in COVID-19 patients, thus it may be a valuable marker for identifying poor outcome of COVID-19.","Ren, Huihui; Yang, Yan; Wang, Fen; Yan, Yongli; Shi, Xiaoli; Dong, Kun; Yu, Xuefeng; Zhang, Shujun",Cardiovasc Diabetol,407,16

At present, the related studies on chronic diseases are mainly focused on a single disease. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of common chronic diseases, the conditions and patterns of comorbidity in middle-aged and elderly people in China. METHODS: We extracted the data from China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). A total of 14 diseases were included, and the prevalence was assessed by self-report. We calculate different disease combinations and perform descriptive statistics analysis of chronic disease and comorbidity status. RESULTS: Among the 6754 subjects, 2833 (42.0%) people had at least one chronic disease, and 1138 (17.0%) people had two or more diseases at the same time. The top three diseases of prevalence were hypertension (15.4%), arthritis or rheumatism (11.0%), and stomach or digestive diseases (9.3%). Common dual disease combinations were hypertension and dyslipidemia, hypertension and arthritis or rheumatism, arthritis or rheumatism and stomach or digestive diseases. CONCLUSION: Comorbidity is common in the population, and the pattern of chronic disease comorbidity is complex. Hypertension exists in a variety of comorbidity patterns, and its screening and prevention should be strengthened.","Fan, Zhao-Ya; Yang, Yuan; Zhang, Chang-Hong; Yin, Ruo-Yun; Tang, Lei; Zhang, Fan",Int J Gen Med,407,16

The pathogenesis of MS is multifactorial and is thought to be triggered by multiple environmental factors in genetically susceptible individuals. Viruses have long been postulated as potential environmental triggers in MS, and there is increasing evidence of a link between viruses and MS. Some of the most compelling data have been found in human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) research. HHV-6 is a ubiquitous, neurotropic herpesvirus; HHV-6 DNA has been found in MS plaques compared to healthy brain tissue. Studies have also shown that MS patients have higher viral titers and higher DNA detection in serum and CSF compared to controls, and that the virus seems to be more actively replicating in MS patients. Potential mechanisms for HHV-6 leading to autoimmunity include molecular mimicry, bystander activation, and epitope spreading, among others.","Jeanne Billioux, Bridgette; Alvarez Lafuente, Roberto; Jacobson, Steven","Human Herpesviruses HHV-6A, HHV-6B & HHV-7",407,24

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study in which all patients presented with suggestive symptoms of COVID-19 were included. The study was carried out in a university-affiliated private hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. Biological radiation dose exposure (cumulative effective dose: CED) was evaluated in millisievert (mSv) units. RESULTS: A total of 1410 patients were included in the study. Of all study subjects, 804 patients (57%) underwent only one chest computed tomography (CT) procedure. Six hundred and six patients (43%) had two or more chest CT procedures. Median CED was 6.02 (min–max:1.67–16.27) mSv. The number of patients who were exposed to ≤ 5 mSv were 149 (24.6%), whereas 457 patients (75.4%) were exposed to >5 mSv. CONCLUSION: The radiation exposure in COVID-19 patients seems unjustifiably high.

Loss of this proper architecture can accommodate and promote lung disease, highlighting researchers’ growing need to analyze lung structures in detail. Additionally, in vivo cellular and molecular response to chemical and physical signals, along with the recapitulation of gene-expression patterns, can be lost during the transition from complex 3D tissues to 2D cell culture systems. Therefore, technologies that allow for the investigation of lung function under normal and disease states utilizing the entirety of the lung architecture are required to generate a complete understanding of these processes. Airway cell-derived organoids that can recapitulate lung structure and function ex vivo while being amenable to experimental manipulation, have provided a new and exciting model system to investigate lung biology. In this perspective, we discuss emerging technologies for culturing lung-derived organoids, techniques to visualize organoids using high-resolution microscopy and the resulting information extracted from organoids supporting research focused on lung function and diseases.

The utility and sustainability of inpatient telemedicine initiatives need to be evaluated as the number of COVID-19 inpatients is expected to continue declining. In this viewpoint, we describe the use of a rapidly deployed inpatient telemedicine workflow at a large academic medical center and discuss the potential impact on PPE savings. In early 2020, videoconferencing software was installed on patient bedside iPads at two academic medical center teaching hospitals. An internal website allowed providers to initiate video calls with patients in any patient room with an activated iPad, including both COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 patients. Patients were encouraged to use telemedicine technology to connect with loved ones via native apps or videoconferencing software. We evaluated the use of telemedicine technology on patients’ bedside iPads by monitoring traffic to the internal website. Between May 2020 and March 2021, there were a total of 1240 active users of the Video Visits website (mean 112.7, SD 49.0 connection events per month). Of these, 133 (10.7%) connections were made. Patients initiated 63 (47.4%) video calls with family or friends and sent 37 (27.8%) emails with videoconference connection instructions. Providers initiated a total of 33 (24.8%) video calls with the majority of calls initiated in August (n=22, 67%). There was a low level of adoption of inpatient telemedicine capability by providers and patients. With sufficient availability of PPE, inpatient providers did not find a frequent need to use the bedside telemedicine technology, despite a high census of patients with COVID-19. Compared to providers, patients used videoconferencing capabilities more frequently in September and October 2020. We did not find savings of PPE associated with the use of inpatient telemedicine.","Halabi, Reem; Smith, Geoffrey; Sylwestrzak, Marc; Clay, Brian; Longhurst, Christopher A; Lander, Lina",J Med Internet Res,407,10

Male F-344 rats were exposed to 175 ppm DMA 6 hr per day for 1, 2, 4, or 9 days or 2 years. Gross changes in nasal structure were recorded, effects of DMA on the mucociliary apparatus were assessed using video analysis, and tissues were evaluated for histopathology. In vitro nasal mucociliary flow patterns, mucus flow rates, and ciliary activity were studied and recorded for video motion analysis. There were distinct and generally consistent differences in the shape of the naso-, maxillo-, and ethmoid turbinates between young and old animals. Acute and chronic DMA exposures resulted in erosion of the anterior margins of the naso- and maxillo-turbinates and fenestration of the adjacent septum. Ciliastasis and mucostasis were observed only on the anteromedial aspect of the maxilloturbinate. In the chronically exposed rats, mucociliary activity was present in areas adjacent to erosions of the turbinates and septum. Abnormal mucus flow patterns, including altered or reversed direction of flow and “whirlpool-like” formation, were observed in all treated rats, but were more severe following chronic exposure. There was a good correlation between the distribution of responses as assessed by histopathology and abnormal mucociliary function at all time points. In conclusion, the mucociliary apparatus continues to function in the nasal passages of rats having localized destruction of nasal epithelium, induced by DMA exposure, and this clearance system responds to alterations of nasal structure by modification of mucus flow patterns.","Gross, E.

H5N1 and H5N8 are the two most fundamental HPAI subtypes detected in birds in the last two decades. The two viruses may compete with each other while sharing the same host population and, thus, suppress the spread of one of the viruses. In this study, we performed a statistical analysis to investigate the temporal correlation of the HPAI H5N1 and HPAI H5N8 subtypes using globally reported data in 2015–2020. This was joined with an in-depth analysis using data generated via our national surveillance program in Egypt. A total of 6412 outbreaks were reported worldwide during this period, with 39% (2529) as H5N1 and 61% (3883) as H5N8. In Egypt, 65% of positive cases were found in backyards, while only 12% were found in farms and 23% in live bird markets. Overall, our findings depict a trade-off between the number of positive H5N1 and H5N8 samples around early 2017, which is suggestive of the potential replacement between the two subtypes. Further research is still required to elucidate the underpinning mechanisms of this competitive dynamic. This, in turn, will implicate the design of effective strategies for disease control.","Amer, Fatma; Li, Ruiyun; Rabie, Neveen; El-Husseiny, Mohamed H.; Yehia, Nahed; Hagag, Naglaa M.; Samy, Mohamed; Selim, Abdullah; Hassan, Mohamed K.; Hassan, Wafaa M.
