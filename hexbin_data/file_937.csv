Transcranial Doppler ultrasound performed four days later demonstrated middle cerebral artery (MCA) velocities greater than 350 cm/sec on the right and greater than 200 cm/sec on the left, despite medical management. The patient demonstrated no focal neurological deficits, though examination was limited by our patient's sedation and intubation. Angiography revealed severe vasospasm of the supraclinoid internal carotid and MCA territories, bilaterally. The vasospasm was refractory to the administration of intra-arterial verapamil. Balloon angioplasty was attempted, but the device could not be advanced safely due to the small size of the patient's vessels and the stiffness of the device. A microcatheter (0.0165"" diameter) was advanced over a J-shaped soft microwire (0.014"" diameter) to perform mechanical angioplasty in the internal carotid artery and MCA vessels bilaterally. Dramatic improvement was seen angiographically and on transcranial Doppler, and no complications were seen.","Snelling, Brian M; Sur, Samir; Shah, Sumedh S; Peterson, Eric C",Journal of cerebrovascular and endovascular neurosurgery,937,31

Yet, despite being strongly linked to adverse outcomes, chronic breathlessness is generally not considered a stand-alone treatment target. Here we move focus from identifying the ""best"" measurement tool and use data-driven techniques to identify and confirm the stability of underlying features (factors) driving breathlessness across different cardiorespiratory diseases. Such frameworks could provide an opportunity to address the underlying mechanisms of breathlessness and over-come issues with co-morbidities, particularly when medical therapies have been optimised. Methods: Longitudinal study of questionnaire data on 182 participants with main diagnoses of asthma (21.4%), COPD (24.7%), heart failure (19.2%), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (18.7%), other interstitial lung disease (5.5%), and ""other diagnoses"" (8.8%) were entered into an exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Participants were stratified based on their EFA factor scores, allowing us to examine whether the breathlessness experience differed across disease diagnosis. We then examined model stability after six months and established through an iterative process the most compact, and therefore least burdensome assessment tool. Results: From the 25 input measures, 16 measures were retained for model validation. The resulting model contained four factors to which we assigned the following descriptive labels: 1) body burden, 2) affect/mood, 3) breathing burden and 4) anger/frustration. Stratifying patients by their scores across the four factors revealed two groups corresponding to high and low burden. These were not found to be predictive of primary disease diagnosis and did remain stable after six months. Conclusions: We have identified four stable and disease-independent factors that seem to underlie the experience of breathlessness. We suggest that interventions may target factors within this framework to answer the question of whether they are also driving the experience itself.","Finnegan, S. L.; Pattinson, K. T.

Drawing from Kolb’s Learning Theory, John Dewey’s theory, Jack Mezirows transformative learning theory, and Jean Piaget’s theory, the authors in this paper offer a viewpoint on some of the practical teaching practices which can be adapted in business schools in India to be successful in this emerging blended or phygital environment. Using a Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework, the authors reflect on the effective teaching practices based on their own experience, theoretical knowledge gained from an exhaustive web search of various databases of the period, particularly from February to August 2020. The authors performed a careful manual content analysis of the selected research papers. They concluded seven principal teaching methods to create an effective blended environment for students and faculties in Indian business schools: a) reframing virtual spaces in India through online knowledge repository and virtual labs b) using reflective thinking for andragogical and pedagogical Indian approach c) Indian teachers’ readiness to offer various genres of courses on demand d) reinforcing resilience in Indian schools through meaningful participation and conflict resolution e) purposeful learning and inquiry-based learning for Indian students f) experiential learning through an inclusive online pivot in India g) useful apps are discussed to reach out to Indian parents community.

Oftentimes, law is subject to interpretation, debate and challenges throughout various courts and jurisdictions. But in some other areas, law leaves little room for interpretation, and essentially aims to rigorously describe a computation, a decision procedure or, simply said, an algorithm. Unfortunately, prose remains a woefully inadequate tool for the job. The lack of formalism leaves room for ambiguities; the structure of legal statutes, with many paragraphs and sub-sections spread across multiple pages, makes it hard to compute the intended outcome of the algorithm underlying a given text; and, as with any other piece of poorly-specified critical software, the use of informal language leaves corner cases unaddressed. We introduce Catala, a new programming language that we specifically designed to allow a straightforward and systematic translation of statutory law into an executable implementation. Catala aims to bring together lawyers and programmers through a shared medium, which together they can understand, edit and evolve, bridging a gap that often results in dramatically incorrect implementations of the law. We have implemented a compiler for Catala, and have proven the correctness of its core compilation steps using the F* proof assistant. We evaluate Catala on several legal texts that are algorithms in disguise, notably section 121 of the US federal income tax and the byzantine French family benefits; in doing so, we uncover a bug in the official implementation. We observe as a consequence of the formalization process that using Catala enables rich interactions between lawyers and programmers, leading to a greater understanding of the original legislative intent, while producing a correct-by-construction executable specification reusable by the greater software ecosystem.","Merigoux, Denis; Chataing, Nicolas; Protzenko, Jonathan",,937,20

METHODS In our study, we have evaluated stress levels in 102 healthcare workers recruited in different rehabilitation departments (psychiatric and multidisciplinary). In particular, we evaluated the fatigue of compassion, vicarious trauma, burnout and hope (hopelessness) in the first two months of lookdown due to the COVID-19. RESULTS The results obtained after the administration of the following evaluation scales: sCFs, CBI, Pro QOL, HBS, showed an overall increase in the scores in all professional figures. Significant compassion fatigue and burnout percentage is present in several groups. The highest levels of hopelessness in some professional figures, while higher educational levels can protect workers from the risk of developing high levels of work stress.

However, it is not known how it switches between these two functions. Here we show that 100K is methylated on arginine residues at its C terminus during infection and that this region is necessary for binding PRMT1 methylase. Methylated 100K is exclusively nuclear. Mutation of the third RGG motif (amino acids 741 to 743) prevents localization to the nucleus during infection, suggesting that methylation of that sequence is important for 100K shuttling. Treatment of infected cells with methylation inhibitors inhibits expression of late structural proteins. These data suggest that arginine methylation of 100K is necessary for its localization to the nucleus and is a critical cellular function necessary for productive adenovirus infection.","Iacovides, Demetris C; O'Shea, Clodagh C; Oses-Prieto, Juan; Burlingame, Alma; McCormick, Frank",Journal of virology,937,9

The authors hypothesized that this results from posterior mandibular displacement caused by the oronasal mask. OBJECTIVE To test this hypothesis using a mandibular advancement device (MAD) for mandibular stabilization. METHODS Subjects whose OSA was not adequately corrected by oronasal CPAP at pressures for which nasal CPAP was effective were identified. These subjects underwent polysomnography (PSG) CPAP titration with each nasal and oronasal mask consecutively, with esophageal pressure and leak monitoring, to obtain the effective pressure (Peff) of CPAP for correcting obstructive events with each mask (maximum 20 cmH2O). PSG titration was repeated using a MAD in the neutral position. Cephalometry was performed. RESULTS Six subjects with mean (± SD) nasal Peff 10.4±3.0 cmH2O were studied. Oronasal Peff was greater than nasal Peff in all subjects, with obstructive events persisting at 20 cmH2O by oronasal mask in four cases. This was not due to excessive leak. With the MAD, oronasal Peff was reduced in three subjects, and Peff <20 cmH2O could be obtained in two of the four subjects with Peff >20 cmH2O by oronasal mask alone. Subjects' cephalometric variables were similar to published norms. CONCLUSION In subjects with OSA with higher oronasal than nasal Peff, this is partially explained by posterior mandibular displacement caused by the oronasal mask. Combination treatment with oronasal mask and MAD may be useful in some individuals if a nasal mask is not tolerated.","Kaminska, Marta; Montpetit, Andree; Mathieu, Annie; Jobin, Vincent; Morisson, Florence; Mayer, Pierre",Canadian respiratory journal,937,1

In this study, we analyzed the feasibility of a crucial viral replication factor, namely, importin-α7, as a cellular drug target to combat pandemic influenza viruses. Surprisingly, only five viral lung-to-lung passages were required to achieve 100% lethality in importin-α7⁻/⁻ mice that otherwise are resistant. Viral escape from importin-α7 requirement was mediated by five mutations in the viral ribonucleoprotein complex and the surface glycoproteins. Moreover, the importin-α7⁻/⁻ mouse-adapted strain became even more virulent for wild-type mice than the parental strain. These studies show that targeting host proteins may still result in viral escape by alternative pathways, eventually giving rise to even more virulent virus strains. Thus, therapeutic intervention strategies should consider a multitarget approach to reduce viral drug resistance. IMPORTANCE Here, we investigated the long-standing hypothesis based on in vitro studies that viral drug resistance occurrence is less likely if compounds are directed against cellular rather than viral proteins. Here, we challenged this hypothesis by analyzing, in an in vivo animal model, the feasibility of targeting the cellular factor importin-α7, which is crucial for human influenza virus replication and pathogenesis, as an efficient antiviral strategy against pandemic influenza viruses. In summary, our studies suggest that resistance against cellular factors is possible in vivo, and the emergence of even more virulent viral escape variants calls for particular caution. Thus, therapeutic intervention strategies should consider a multitarget approach using compounds against viral as well as cellular factors to reduce the risk of viral drug resistance and potentially increased virulence.","Resa-Infante, Patricia; Paterson, Duncan; Bonet, Jaume; Otte, Anna; Oliva, Baldo; Fodor, Ervin; Gabriel, Gülsah",Journal of virology,937,1

193395,193395,193395,[Isolation and identification of SARS virus in Guangdong province].,14.574264,15.217076,2003,"Vaccines against infectious bronchitis of chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) have arguably been the most successful, and certainly the most widely used, of vaccines for diseases caused by coronaviruses, the others being against bovine, canine, feline and porcine coronaviruses. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), together with the genetically related coronaviruses of turkey (Meleagris gallopovo) and ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), is a group 3 coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus being tentatively in group 4, the other known mammalian coronaviruses being in groups 1 and 2. IBV replicates not only in respiratory tissues (including the nose, trachea, lungs and airsacs, causing respiratory disease), but also in the kidney (associated with minor or major nephritis), oviduct, and in many parts of the alimentary tract--the oesophagus, proventriculus, duodenum, jejunum, bursa of Fabricius, caecal tonsils (near the distal end of the tract), rectum and cloaca (the common opening for release of eggs and faeces), usually without clinical effects. The virus can persist, being re-excreted at the onset of egg laying (4 to 5 months of age), believed to be a consequence of the stress of coming into lay. Genetic lines of chickens differ in the extent to which IBV causes mortality in chicks, and in respect of clearance of the virus after the acute phase. Live attenuated (by passage in chicken embryonated eggs) IBV strains were introduced as vaccines in the 1950s, followed a couple of decades later by inactivated vaccines for boosting protection in egg-laying birds. Live vaccines are usually applied to meat-type chickens at 1 day of age. In experimental situations this can result in sterile immunity when challenged by virulent homologous virus. Although 100% of chickens may be protected (against clinical signs and loss of ciliary activity in trachea), sometimes 10% of vaccinated chicks do not respond with a protective immune response. Protection is short lived, the start of the decline being apparent 9 weeks after vaccination with vaccines based on highly attenuated strains. IBV exists as scores of serotypes (defined by the neutralization test), cross-protection often being poor. Consequently, chickens may be re-vaccinated, with the same or another serotype, two or three weeks later. Single applications of inactivated virus has generally led to protection of <50% of chickens. Two applications have led to 90 to 100% protection in some reports, but remaining below 50% in others. In practice in the field, inactivated vaccines are used in laying birds that have previously been primed with two or three live attenuated virus vaccinations. This increases protection of the laying birds against egg production losses and induces a sustained level of serum antibody, which is passed to progeny. The large spike glycoprotein (S) comprises a carboxy-terminal S2 subunit (approximately 625 amino acid residues), which anchors S in the virus envelope, and an amino-terminal S1 subunit (approximately 520 residues), believed to largely form the distal bulbous part of S. The S1 subunit (purified from IBV virus, expressed using baculovirus or expressed in birds from a fowlpoxvirus vector) induced virus neutralizing antibody. Although protective immune responses were induced, multiple inoculations were required and the percentage of protected chickens was too low (<50%) for commercial application. Remarkably, expression of S1 in birds using a non-pathogenic fowl adenovirus vector induced protection in 90% and 100% of chickens in two experiments. Differences of as little as 5% between the S1 sequences can result in poor cross-protection. Differences in S1 of 2 to 3% (10 to 15 amino acids) can change serotype, suggesting that a small number of epitopes are immunodominant with respect to neutralizing antibody. Initial studies of the role of the IBV nucleocapsid protein (N) in immunity suggested that immunization with bacterially expressed N, while not inducing protection directly, improved the induction of protection by a subsequent inoculation with inactivated IBV. In another study, two intramuscular immunizations of a plasmid expressing N induced protective immunity. The basis of immunity to IBV is not well understood. Serum antibody levels do not correlate with protection, although local antibody is believed to play a role. Adoptive transfer of IBV-infection-induced alphabeta T cells bearing CD8 antigen protected chicks from challenge infection. In conclusion, live attenuated IBV vaccines induce good, although short-lived, protection against homologous challenge, although a minority of individuals may respond poorly. Inactivated IBV vaccines are insufficiently efficacious when applied only once and in the absence of priming by live vaccine. Two applications of inactivated IBV are much more efficacious, although this is not a commercially viable proposition in the poultry industry. However, the cost and logistics of multiple application of a SARS inactivated vaccine would be more acceptable for the protection of human populations, especially if limited to targeted groups (e.g. health care workers and high-risk contacts). Application of a SARS vaccine is perhaps best limited to a minimal number of targeted individuals who can be monitored, as some vaccinated persons might, if infected by SARS coronavirus, become asymptomatic excretors of virus, thereby posing a risk to non-vaccinated people. Looking further into the future, the high efficacy of the fowl adenovirus vector expressing the IBV S1 subunit provides optimism for a live SARS vaccine, if that were deemed to be necessary, with the possibility of including the N protein gene.","Cavanagh, Dave",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,937,1

In this study we have investigated antibody titers in KS patients older than 6 months of age. METHODS Serum of 81 patients with KS older than 6 months of age, before intravenous gamma-globulin therapy, and 88 normal age-matched children were used in this study. The IgG antibody titers against four kinds of superantigens were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS The KS patients showed significantly elevated mean SPEA titer (P = 0.006) and significantly higher incidence of high SPEA (P = 0.0024) compared with the controls. The SPEA titer in KS patients showed a significant positive correlation with the number of days from onset of illness (P = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS The elevated antibody titer against superantigens of KS patients older than 6 months of age was different from that of KS patients younger than 6 months of age. Our results suggest that KS patients' exposure to SPEA occurred a few weeks before the onset of KS. SPEA may be one of the possible etiologic agents of KS among patients older than 6 months of age in Kagoshima, Japan.","Nomura, Yuichi; Masuda, Kiminori; Yoshinaga, Masao; Takei, Syuji; Miyata, Koichiro",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,937,28

Cities--now the dominant human habitat--must be planned and managed sustainably in a world that is manifestly experiencing increasing environmental and social strains. Early industrialisation entailed crowding, squalor and industrial environmental blight; the two great associated public health hazards were infectious diseases and air pollution. These hazards have been largely controlled in rich countries. Today's main urban health hazards are obesity (with its life-shortening health consequences) and the huge contribution of cities to climate change with the resultant risks to population health. These and other health issues in urban environments need to be understood and addressed at the community or population level. This is an ecological challenge, crucial to attaining real sustainability.","McMichael, Anthony J",New South Wales public health bulletin,937,1

Equally, the global distribution of the viruses in their animal reservoir has yet to be established. The experience of investigating and controlling another novel coronavirus, SARS, in 2003 shows how national and local investigations can come together as an international coalition and successfully avert epidemics. A menu of studies that need to be undertaken, especially in the countries experiencing transmission, is presented here.","Nicoll, A",Eastern Mediterranean health journal = La revue de sante de la Mediterranee orientale = al-Majallah al-sihhiyah li-sharq al-mutawassit,937,29

METHODS At the peak of the 2003 SARS outbreak, we assessed health care workers in 2 acute care Hong Kong general hospitals with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). One year later, we reassessed these health care workers with the PSS-10, the 21-Item Depression and Anxiety Scale (DASS-21), and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R). We recruited high-risk health care workers who practised respiratory medicine and compared them with nonrespiratory medicine workers, who formed the low-risk health care worker control group. RESULTS In 2003, high-risk health care workers had elevated stress levels (PSS-10 score = 17.0) that were not significantly different from levels in low-risk health care worker control subjects (PSS-10 score = 15.9). More high-risk health care workers reported fatigue, poor sleep, worry about health, and fear of social contact, despite their confidence in infection-control measures. By 2004, however, stress levels in the high-risk group were not only higher (PSS-10 score = 18.6) but also significantly higher than scores among low-risk health care worker control subjects (PSS-10 score = 14.8, P < 0.05). In 2004, the perceived stress levels in the high-risk group were associated with higher depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress scores (P < 0.001). Posttraumatic stress scores were a partial mediator of the relation between the high risk of exposure to SARS and higher perceived stress. CONCLUSIONS Health care workers who were at high risk of contracting SARS appear not only to have chronic stress but also higher levels of depression and anxiety. Front-line staff could benefit from stress management as part of preparation for future outbreaks.","McAlonan, Grainne M; Lee, Antoinette M; Cheung, Vinci; Cheung, Charlton; Tsang, Kenneth W T; Sham, Pak C; Chua, Siew E; Wong, Josephine G W S",Canadian journal of psychiatry.

In our study, we included 174 women for whom spectral mammography was performed for diagnostic purposes. The relationship between enhancement in CESM and blood vessel density (BVD), lymphatic vessel density (LVD) or the percentage of fields with at least one lymphatic vessel (distribution of podoplanin-positive vessels - DPV) and other related parameters was assessed in 55 cases. BVD, LVD and DPV were assessed immunohistochemically, applying podoplanin and CD31/CD34 as markers of lymphatic and blood vessels, respectively. The sensitivity (in detection of malignant lesions) of CESM was 100%, while its specificity - 39%. We found a significant positive correlation between the intensity of enhancement in CESM and BVD (p = 0.007, r = 0.357) and a negative correlation between the intensity of enhancement in CESM and DPV (p = 0.003, r = -0.390). Lesions with the highest enhancement in CESM showed a high number of blood vessels and a low number of lymphatics. CONCLUSIONS 1) CESM is a method characterized by high sensitivity and acceptable specificity; 2) the correlation between CESM results and blood/lymphatic vessel density confirms its utility in detection of tissue angiogenesis and/or lymphangiogenesis.","Luczynska, Elzbieta; Niemiec, Joanna; Ambicka, Aleksandra; Adamczyk, Agnieszka; Walasek, Tomasz; Ryś, Janusz; Sas-Korczyńska, Beata",Polish journal of pathology : official journal of the Polish Society of Pathologists,937,17

The previous studies have failed to establish the efficacy of HRCT in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Objective The current study aimed to assess the efficacy of HRCT as compared to a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia in patients in our setting. Methodology A prospective observational study was conducted at the Department of Chest Medicine, Shifa International Hospital from April 2020 to December 2020. A total of 250 patients were admitted to medical intensive care units. Findings of HRCT and PCR were documented. The accuracy of HRCT compared with PCR was assessed. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 24 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results COVID-19 infection was more prevalent in male patients (62.8% vs 37.2%). The mean age was 60 years (interquartile range, IQR, 49-72). Sensitivity and specificity of HRCT segregated into typical, indeterminate, and atypical HRCT were (94.8%, 56.8%), (92.7%, 47.2%), and (91.7%, 76.8%), respectively. The positive predictive value for typical HRCT was 84.3% (p≤0.001). Conclusion We concluded that typical HRCT findings have diagnostic utility in the diagnosis of COVID pneumonia. Similarly, a negative HRCT chest reliably excludes the possibility of COVID pneumonia. HRCT chest is a reliable alternative to RT-PCR.","Murtaza, Hafiz G; Javed, Nasir; Iqbal, Ahtesham; Ramzan, Moazma; Lodhi, Omair ul haq; Majid, Sadaf; Abbas, Kiran; Rehman, Abdul",Cureus,937,1

It is widely accepted that these electives contribute to improved clinical examination and communication skills. Overseas electives also exert a strong influence over future career decisions and often pave the way for later international work. Whilst the positive outcomes are known, little information exists regarding elective preferences and destinations overall, information that could help optimise a safe learning experience and maximise the potential for one of the highlights of medical education. In order to obtain analytical data that could assist medical elective framework development, we systematically reviewed the two largest German online databases cataloguing abroad elective testimonies. RESULTS: We identified 856 overseas elective reports uploaded within the last five years. European destinations were the most sought-after choice among German-speaking medical students. Interest in abroad electives in the United States (U.S.), a traditionally popular destination, was much lower than expected. U.S. elective reports accounted for only 3 % of long-term electives. Electives in low- and middle-income countries were generally less popular than electives in high-income countries. General surgery was the most popular elective discipline, followed by Emergency Medicine and Gynaecology and Obstetrics. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a large inhomogeneity in German-speaking medical students’ elective choices, potentially influenced by financial and organizational aspects as well as geopolitical developments. This highlights a crucial challenge for medical schools and other organizations involved in elective planning. In light of regional differences, our data suggest that a “one size fits all” preparation is not pertinent to optimize students’ elective experience. Country- or region-specific pre-departure trainings and more individualized elective frameworks might be necessary to address these differences and to ensure a safe learning experience for students.
