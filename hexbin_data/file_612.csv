The adverse neurobiological impact of pain and stress in the preterm infant has been well documented, including neuroimaging and neurobehavioral outcomes. Although many tools have been validated to assess acute pain, few methods are available to assess chronic pain or agitation (a clinical manifestation of neonatal stress). Both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches are used to reduce the negative impact of pain and agitation in the preterm infant, with concerns emerging over the adverse effects of analgesia and sedatives. Considering benefits and risks of available treatments, units must develop a stepwise algorithm to prevent, assess, and treat pain. Nonpharmacologic interventions should be consistently utilized prior to mild to moderately painful procedures. Sucrose may be utilized judiciously as an adjunctive therapy for minor painful procedures. Rapidly acting opioids (fentanyl or remifentanil) form the backbone of analgesia for moderately painful procedures. Chronic sedation during invasive mechanical ventilation represents an ongoing challenge; appropriate containment and an optimal environment should be standard; when indicated, low-dose morphine infusion may be utilized cautiously and dexmedetomidine infusion may be considered as an emerging adjunct.","McPherson, Christopher; Miller, Steven P.; El-Dib, Mohamed; Massaro, An N.; Inder, Terrie E.",Pediatr Res,612,1
11785,11785,11785,The “Uncurated Exposure” of Videoconferencing,18.101929,0.8856856,2020-06-09,"BACKGROUND: Less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) is a way of giving surfactant without endotracheal intubation and has shown to be promising in reducing the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. However, the mechanism underlying its beneficial effect and variations in the technique of administration may prevent its widespread use. This trial aims to evaluate the effects of two methods of surfactant administration, LISA or endotracheal surfactant administration followed by low peak pressure (LPPSA) ventilation, in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). METHODS: The LISA Or Low Peak Pressure trial is to be conducted in 14 tertiary neonatal intensive care units in China. A total of 600 preterm infants born with gestational age between 25(0/7) and 31(6/7) weeks and with a primary diagnosis of RDS will be involved in the study. Infants will be randomized to the LISA or LPPSA group when surfactant therapy is indicated. Primary outcomes include mortality, severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age (PMA), and mechanical ventilation (MV) in the first 72 h of life. Secondary outcomes include the days of MV, duration of all sorts of non-invasive respiratory support, fraction of inspired oxygen, oxygen saturation before and after surfactant administration, and time required to perform the procedure for surfactant administration. The incidence of comorbidities, including retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA), pneumothorax, and massive pulmonary hemorrhage within 48 h of surfactant administration, and the failure rates of each technique will be determined. DISCUSSION: Data from recent systematic review and meta-analysis have suggested a possible improvement in outcomes of preterm infants with RDS by the LISA technique. However, robust evidence is lacking. Why LISA plays a potential role in reducing respiratory morbidity, mainly BPD in preterm infants, remains unclear. The possible explanations are the active and uninterrupted delivery of continuous positive airway pressure during the LISA procedure and the avoidance of complications caused by intubation and relatively high pressure/volume ventilation following surfactant administration. We hypothesized that LISA’s effectiveness lies mainly in avoiding relatively high-pressure positive ventilation immediately following surfactant administration. Thus, this multicenter randomized controlled trial will focus on issues of endotracheal intubation and the pressure/volume used during conventional surfactant administration. The effectiveness, safety and comorbidities of preterm infants following LISA or LPPSA will be evaluated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR1900020970.

METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was carried out by enrolling practicing doctors of Pakistan with experience of ≥6 months by sending a validated and piloted questionnaire through email. Data collection was done from 10(th) October to 9th November 2020 after taking ethical approval from the concerned authorities. Data was analysed using SPSS v. 19.0. RESULTS: Two-hundred-forty responses were received with a response rate of 63%. Female participants (62.8%) were in majority and most of the participants were working in urban (88.5%) or semi-urban (9%) locality in either teaching (35.9%) or tertiary care hospitals (34.6%). Seventy-three percent of the doctors didn’t receive formal training with more than half of the doctors reporting non-availability of infrastructure and specific hardware. A large number of the participants were concerned regarding the non-availability of regulatory bodies, evaluations and accreditations of the service providers, the risks of malpractice, missed-diagnosis, prescription errors and medico-legal issues. The availability of specific infrastructure was statistically related to the hospital setup, locality and the specialty of the participants. Lack of technological literacy and infrastructure were considered the main constraints for the public in using telemedicine. CONCLUSION: Evidence of effectiveness of telemedicine across different fields is inconsistent and lacks technical, legal, cultural and ethical considerations. Inadequate training, low level of technological literacy and lack of infrastructure are the main barriers in implementing tele-health. High-quality evidence based studies are required for practical and long-term policies.","Alam, Laima; Alam, Mafaza; Malik, Amina Mannan; Faraid, Varqa",Pak J Med Sci,612,7

A number of approaches have been proposed for how to reverse formal models of concurrent computation including process calculi such as CCS, languages like Erlang, prime event structures and occurrence nets. However it has not been settled what properties a reversible system should enjoy, nor how the various properties that have been suggested, such as the parabolic lemma and the causal-consistency property, are related. We contribute to a solution to these issues by using a generic labelled transition system equipped with a relation capturing whether transitions are independent to explore the implications between these properties. In particular, we show how they are derivable from a set of axioms. Our intention is that when establishing properties of some formalism it will be easier to verify the axioms rather than proving properties such as the parabolic lemma directly. We also introduce two new notions related to causal consistent reversibility, namely causal safety and causal liveness, and show that they are derivable from our axioms.","Lanese, Ivan; Phillips, Iain; Ulidowski, Irek",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,612,11

This survey set out to assess the perceived effects of COVID-19 on surgical training. METHOD: A survey was circulated amongst surgical trainees to assess perceived effects from the COVID-19 pandemic on their surgical training. This was circulated amongst surgical trainees in Malta and London. 32 surgical trainees from Malta and 25 from London responded. Results were analysed, tabulated and compared. RESULTS: Less Malta trainees were redeployed than UK (3% vs 80%), whist both had rotations postponed or cancelled (62.5% vs. 92%). Trainees felt logbook opportunities (78% vs 100%) and theatre experience (97% vs 100%) had reduced. Trainees were unsure of how this would affect their progression (56% vs 52%), and some felt recruitment criteria should be adjusted in view of the above (50% vs 68%). Overall, both groups agreed their surgical education had been negatively impacted (84% vs 100%).

Studies have shown epithelial CTCs and folate receptor (FR) positive CTCs could be used as diagnostic biomarkers for lung cancer (LC). This study aimed to determine whether cell surface vimentin (CSV) positive CTCs could be used as a biomarker for LC as well. METHODS: 78 treatment-naïve non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, 21 patients with benign lung diseases (BLD) and 9 healthy donors (HD) were enrolled in this study. CTC detection was performed using CytoSorter(®) mesenchymal CTC kit (CSV). The correlation between CSV positive CTCs (CSV-CTCs) and LC patients’ clinicopathological characteristics would be evaluated, and diagnostic performances of CSV-CTCs and serum tumor markers for LC would be compared. RESULTS: CTC detection rates (average CTC count: range) in LC patients, patients with BLD and HD were 83.33% (2.47: 0-8), 47.62% (0.5: 0-3) and 0% (0: 0), respectively. CSV-CTCs could be used to differentiate LC patients from the patients with BLD and HD (P < 0.0001). CSV-CTCs were correlated with cancer stage, lymph node involvement and distant metastasis (P = 0.0062, 0.0014 and 0.0021, respectively). With a CTC cut-off value of 2, CSV-CTCs would have a sensitivity and specificity of 0.67 and 0.87, respectively, for diagnosing LC. CSV-CTC positive rates showed statistical differences among HD, BLD patients and LC patients at different cancer stages (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, CSV-CTC positive rates were positively correlated with tumor size, lymph node involvement and distant metastasis (P = 0.0163, 0.0196 and 0.03, respectively). CSV-CTCs had a better diagnostic performance than serum tumor makers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), cancer antigen 125 (CA125) and CA153. CONCLUSION: When CTC cut-off is set to 2 CTCs per 7.5 mL of blood, CSV-CTCs can be considered as an acceptable biomarker for diagnosing LC with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.67 and 0.87, respectively.","Xie, Xiaohong; Wang, Liqiang; Wang, Xinni; Fan, Wan-Hung; Qin, Yinyin; Lin, Xinqing; Xie, Zhanhong; Liu, Ming; Ouyang, Ming; Li, Shiyue; Zhou, Chengzhi",Front Oncol,612,22

This article aims to highlight the legal, ethical and professional aspects that might be relevant to anaesthesiologists in the case of a high-lethality infectious disease such as a severe pandemic influenza. The epidemiology, the role of anaesthesiologists and possible threats to the profession and colleagueship within medical specialties relevant to anaesthesiologists are reviewed. During historical plague epidemics, some doctors have behaved like 'deserters'. However, during the Spanish influenza, physicians remained at their jobs, although many perished. In surveys, more than half of the health-care workers have reported their willingness to work in the case of severe pandemics. Physicians have the same human rights as all citizens: they have to be effectively protected against infectious disease. However, they have a duty to treat.

Using real-time RT-PCR, CDV RNA was detected in organs of an Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) found dead in the Doñana National Park, Southwestern Andalusia, Spain. This finding may be of great importance for the conservation of the species; at present the Iberian lynx is the most critically endangered wild felid. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the significance of CDV for the Iberian lynx population. High viral loads were evident in the dead lynx, suggesting an etiological involvement of CDV in its death. When carnivores from the same region were analyzed by CDV RT-PCR, a stone marten (Martes foina) was positive. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated high identity of the two detected CDVs and a close relationship to the European dog lineage of CDV. Antibodies to CDV were detected in 14.8% of 88 tested free-ranging Iberian lynxes. The sample seroprevalence was significantly higher in lynxes from the Doñana Natural Space (22.9%) than Sierra Morena (5%). The stone marten and a red fox (Vulpes vulpes) also tested seropositive. In conclusion, CDV is present in the Iberian lynx population, especially in the Doñana region, with sporadic cases of disease.

Results The study included 850 patients (median age 77.4 years, 49.3% female, 80.1% with cardioembolism). Compared with those with large-artery atherosclerosis, patients with cardioembolism were older, more often female, and more likely to have a history of hypercholesterolaemia, atrial fibrillation, current smoking (each p < 0.0001) and higher median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores on admission (p = 0.030). They were more frequently treated with stent retrievers (p = 0.007), but the median number of stent retriever attempts was lower (p = 0.016) and fewer had permanent stent placements (p ⩽ 0.004). Univariable analysis showed that patients with cardioembolism had worse 3-month survival [72.7% versus 84%, odds ratio (OR) = 0.51; p = 0.004] and modified Rankin scale (mRS) score shift (p = 0.043) and higher rates of post-interventional heart failure (33.5% versus 18.5%, OR = 2.22; p < 0.0001), but better modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI) score shift (p = 0.025). Excellent (mRS = 0-1) 3-month outcome, successful reperfusion (mTICI = 2b-3), symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage and Updated Charlson Comorbidity Index were similar between groups.

Stroke aetiology was not an independent predictor of favourable mRS score shift, but lower admission NIHSS score, younger age and independence pre-stroke were (each p < 0.0001). Stroke aetiology was not an independent predictor of heart failure, but older age, admission antithrombotics and dependence pre-stroke were (each ⩽0.027). Stroke aetiology was not an independent predictor of favourable mTICI score shift, but application of stent retriever and no permanent intracranial stent placement were (each ⩽0.044).

Residual AVMs were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery or surgery. The rate of complete obliteration with embolization alone was 27.3%. The overall obliteration rate after endovascular embolization with/without subsequent stereotactic radiosurgery or surgery was 72.7%. Eudragit-E caused two cases of cerebral infarction. One case of intracerebral hemorrhage due to postoperative hemodynamic changes also occurred. The rate of complications directly related to embolization was 10.0%.

Frequently multiple pass protocols are used. A split bolus contrast protocol can reduce the number of passes through the body, and thereby radiation exposure, in this relatively young and vitally threatened population. PURPOSE To evaluate three protocols for single pass total body scanning in 64-slice multidetector CT (MDCT) on optimal image quality. MATERIAL AND METHODS Three total body CT protocols were prospectively evaluated in three series of 10 consecutive trauma patients. In Group A unenhanced brain and cervical spine CT was followed by chest-abdomen-pelvis CT in portovenous phase after repositioning of the arms. Group B underwent brain CT followed without arm repositioning by a one-volume contrast CT from skull base to the pubic symphysis. Group C was identical to Group A, but the torso was scanned with a split bolus technique. Three radiologists independently evaluated protocol quality scores (5-point Likert scale), parenchymal and vascular enhancement and artifacts. RESULTS Overall image quality was good (4.10) in Group A, more than satisfactory (3.38) in Group B, and nearly excellent (4.75) in Group C (P < 0.001). Interfering artifacts were mostly reported in Group B in the liver and spleen. CONCLUSION In single pass total body CT scanning a split bolus technique reached the highest overall image quality compared to conventional total body CT and one-volume contrast CT.","Beenen, Ludo F M; Sierink, Joanne C; Kolkman, Saskia; Nio, C Yung; Saltzherr, Teun Peter; Dijkgraaf, Marcel G W; Goslings, J Carel",Acta radiologica,612,31

The COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in a massive surge in the need for intensive care unit (ICU) care. To avoid being overwhelmed, hospitals had to adapt and support the ICU teams in structured ICU care including involving surgical teams. This work aims at describing the collaborative efforts between the ICU care team and the Surgical Task Force (STF) during a surge of ICU activity in a University Hospital in a French high-density COVID-19 cluster. Study Design. This retrospective single center study analyzed the STF workflow and the ICU population. The study included 55 patients hospitalized in our ICU, ICU-converted step-down units, and post-anesthesia care units. The primary measure was the global daily STF activity. The secondary measure was the daily activity for each of the 5 tasks accomplished by the STF. Results. The STF attempted 415 phone calls for 55 patients' families, 237 mobilizations of patients requiring prone positions, follow-up of 20 patients requiring medevac, and contribution to ethical discussion for 2 patients. The mean (SD) daily number of successful phones calls, ethical discussions, mobilizations of patients requiring prone positions and medevac follow-up were 18 (7), .1 (.4), 10 (7), and 2 (3), respectively. No actions for discharge summaries writing were required. The maximum number of daily mobilizations for patients requiring prone positions was 25. The maximum number of daily attempted phone calls and successful phone calls were 37 and 26, respectively. Conclusion.

SUMMARY Depression is preventable and treatable. It is imperative to detect and manage depression in CVD patients. Additional research is required to see whether or not comprehensive patient screening for depression translates into both better quality of life and improved clinical outcomes.","Hare, David L",Current opinion in lipidology,612,11

However, some people complete formal documents without discussing them with others. If they become incapacitated, their appointed decision makers may lack guidance on how to interpret or enact their formal wishes. We document the prevalence and correlates of this partial approach to ACP. METHODS Using multinomial logistic regression models and data from a U.S. sample of 4,836 older adults in the 2018 wave of the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), this brief report evaluated associations between social integration indicators and the odds of completing (a) both discussions and formal plans (two-pronged ACP), (b) discussions only, (c) no ACP, and (d) formal ACP only (reference category). We adjust for demographic and health characteristics established as correlates of ACP. RESULTS A minority (15%) of NHATS participants reported formal plans without having discussed them. Indicators of social isolation (e.g., smaller social networks, fewer social activities) increased the odds of engaging in formal planning only compared to two-pronged ACP. Socioeconomic disadvantage and probable dementia reduced the odds of having end-of-life conversations, whether as one's only preparation or in tandem with formal preparations. DISCUSSION Socially isolated persons are especially likely to do formal planning only, which is considered less effective than two-pronged ACP. Health care professionals should recognize that older adults with few kin may require additional support and guidance when doing ACP.","Boerner, Kathrin; Moorman, Sara M; Carr, Deborah; Ornstein, Katherine A","The journals of gerontology.

Trauma by inducing inflammation and activating proteolytic pathways may potentiate the effects of mechanical ventilation on the diaphragm. In a blunt chest trauma with concomitant injuries we tested the hypothesis that trauma via inflammation further activates the proteolytic pathways and worsens atrophy in the diaphragm. MATERIAL AND METHODS Piglets were separated into 2 groups and underwent 72hrs of mechanical ventilation. One group received a polytrauma (PT) by unilateral femur fracture, blunt chest trauma with lung contusion, laparotomy with standardized liver incision and a predefined haemorrhagic shock. The second mechanically ventilated group (MV) did not receive any trauma. A non-ventilated group (Con) served as control.Diaphragmatic fibre dimensions, Western Blot analyses of proteolytic pathways and lipid peroxidation and mRNA levels of cytokines and NFkB subunit p65 were measured. RESULTS Active Caspase-3 was significantly increased in MV (p = 0.019), and in PT (p = 0.02) compared to Con. NFkB subunit p65, was up-regulated in PT (p = 0.010) compared to Con. IL-6 mRNA increased significantly in PT compared to Con (p = 0.0024) but did not differ between Con and MV. CONCLUSION Trauma and mechanical ventilation induced proteolysis and atrophy in the diaphragm, but only polytrauma induced an inflammatory response in the diaphragm. The additional traumatic inflammatory stimulus did not increase the levels of the pre-mentioned variables. These data underline that inflammation is not a major contributor to VIDD.

BACKGROUND Although headache are among the most prevalent and most burdensome neurologic conditions, headache medicine is often considered underrepresented in neurology departments. Additionally, prior studies have shown that many neurology residency directors feel that training programs do not include an adequate amount of exposure to headache clinics or headache-related didactics. One important aspect of didactic education in neurology departments is adult neurology grand rounds. Previous publications have evaluated neither the proportion of headache-related grand rounds in academic neurology departments nor the residency program directors' views on appropriate amount of headache-related grand rounds. Our study has attempted to quantify this information to elucidate opportunities to improve practice educational gaps. METHODS In this cross-sectional study, we surveyed adult neurology residency directors (from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education [ACGME] listing of academic adult neurology residency programs) between October 2018 and September 2019. In addition, we used two methods to obtain the proportion of headache-related grand rounds in neurology: (1) emailing residency directors a questionnaire asking for a list of prior grand rounds topics and (2) an online search for each academic neurology program. RESULTS First, for our grand rounds analysis, headache medicine consisted of 3.7% of the lectures in 2017-2018 and 6.3% of the lectures in 2018-2019 (average of each institution; 17 institutions and 411 total lectures in 2017-2018, 21 institutions and 463 total lectures in 2018-2019). The most common number of lectures on headache medicine for each grand rounds series was zero (for 7 of 17 grand rounds series in 2017-2018 and 7 of 21 in 2018-2019), followed closely by one lecture (for 6 of 17 grand rounds series in 2017-2018 and 6 of 21 in 2018-2019). Second, for our survey, the response rate was 19.3% (29/150). No residency director thought their institution had too many grand rounds dedicated to headache medicine, and 62.1% (18/29) thought they had an adequate amount of headache grand rounds. Within the survey responders, 75.9% (22/29) of adult neurology residency programs have a board-certified headache specialist at their institution. CONCLUSIONS Although most adult neurology residency directors believe that headache is adequately represented in adult neurology grand rounds, headache medicine makes up 4%-6% of all neurology grand rounds. Compared with other neurology subspecialties and the other core ACGME milestones, headache makes up the fewest grand rounds lectures that were assessed in this study.","Burish, Mark J; Ahmed, Zubair A; Rosen, Noah L; Halker Singh, Rashmi B",Headache,612,1

To facilitate monitoring in the humid forests of northeast Central America, we conducted point count surveys for birds across gradients of disturbance in the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary, Belize, and analyzed the association of bird species with remotely sensed metrics of forest condition and anthropogenic disturbance using indicator species analysis. Twenty species exhibited significant associations with one or more of these metrics. We propose six species as indicators for anthropogenic disturbance based on our criteria of being associated with anthropogenically disturbed sites, or anthropogenically disturbed and riparian sites with no explicit mention in the literature of an obligate association with riparian habitats, or association of remotely sensed metrics that appeared to reflect disturbance: yellow-olive flycatcher, red-legged honeycreeper, dusky antbird, blue ground dove, buff-throated saltator, and brown jay. We propose the keel-billed motmot as an indicator of undisturbed forest based on its association with forested sites in our analyses. Green shrike vireo, collard trogon, rufous-tailed jacamar, and rufous piha were associated with a specific elevational range but not associated with disturbance, so upward shifts in elevation that might indicate response to climate change would not be confounded with habitat disturbance or degradation. This exercise yielded a much-reduced list of monitoring targets, which will greatly reduce the cost and complexity of forest bird monitoring in the region, as well as reducing barriers to participation.","King, David I; Jeffery, Matthew; Bailey, Brett A",Environmental monitoring and assessment,612,1

Clinicians should avoid viewing formal or subjective risk assessment as a means of classifying patients into 2 distinct categories: compliant patients and substance abusers. The provider who perceives a patient as compliant may have a complacent attitude toward aberrant drug-related behavior, presuming that these signs reflect inadequately controlled pain, to be addressed by dose escalation. The provider who perceives a patient as a substance abuser may refuse to provide treatment for pain, leaving the patient to seek either illicit drugs or prescribed treatment from another provider. In fact, in seemingly compliant patients, any noncompliant use of opioids presents a safety risk regardless of the explanations offered. Even in known or suspected drug abusers, chronic pain warrants the use of adequate pharmacotherapy, although treatment in such cases may exclude drugs with high abuse potential. Thus, all aberrant drug-related behavior should be addressed within a treatment plan that combines adequate pain care with suitable interventions for the aberrant behavior, following current best practice strategies. This approach is consistent with the approach taken with other health conditions, such as diabetes or hypertension, for which it is understood that noncompliance with therapy presents a risk of harm.","Gordon, Allan; Cone, Edward J; DePriest, Anne Z; Axford-Gatley, Robert A; Passik, Steven D",Postgraduate medicine,612,19

Leuprolide acetate, an analog of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, is widely used to treat endometriosis; however, the molecular mechanisms involved in endometriotic tissue regression remain unclear. We performed miRNA expression profiling of clinical ovarian endometrioma to obtain insight into the effects of leuprolide acetate treatment. METHODS We obtained clinical samples from nine normal eutopic endometrium, eight ovarian endometriotic, and 12 leuprolide acetate-treated endometriotic tissues. We compared the miRNA expression profiles of the three groups by performing TaqMan Array MicroRNA Card and bioinformatic analysis. RESULTS Two miRNAs, miR-939 and miR-154, were upregulated in endometriotic tissue and downregulated in leuprolide acetate-treated endometriotic tissue. Five miRNAs (miR-146a, miR-142-3p, miR-136*, miR-125b-1* and miR-15b*) were unchanged in endometriotic tissue but were upregulated under leuprolide acetate treatment. Ingenuity pathway analysis using predicted target genes for the seven identified miRNAs suggested the involvement of a range of pathways, including axonal guidance, bone morphogenetic protein, phosphatase and tensin homolog and nitric oxide signaling; molecular mechanisms of cancer; and the adipogenesis and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathways. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the first report profiling the miRNAs of endometrioma under leuprolide acetate treatment. The expression of seven miRNAs was modulated, concomitant with the disease state. This result gives new insight into the effects of leuprolide acetate treatment.

Following the initial surge of infections, focus shifted to managing the longer-term sequelae of illness in survivors. 'Post-acute COVID' (known colloquially as 'long COVID') is emerging as a prevalent syndrome. It encompasses a plethora of debilitating symptoms (including breathlessness, chest pain, palpitations and orthostatic intolerance) which can last for weeks or more following mild illness. We describe a series of individuals with symptoms of 'long COVID', and we posit that this condition may be related to a virus- or immune-mediated disruption of the autonomic nervous system resulting in orthostatic intolerance syndromes. We suggest that all physicians should be equipped to recognise such cases, appreciate the symptom burden and provide supportive management. We present our rationale for an underlying impaired autonomic physiology post-COVID-19 and suggest means of management.","Dani, Melanie; Dirksen, Andreas; Taraborrelli, Patricia; Torocastro, Miriam; Panagopoulos, Dimitrios; Sutton, Richard; Lim, Phang Boon",Clinical medicine,612,31

Radionuclide imaging of IGF-1R in tumors might be used for selection of patients who would most likely benefit from IGF-1R-targeted therapy. The goal of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of in vivo radionuclide imaging of IGF-1R expression in prostate cancer xenografts using a small nonimmunoglobulin-derived binding protein called an Affibody molecule. METHODS The IGF-1R-binding Z(IGF1R:4551) Affibody molecule was site-specifically conjugated with a maleimido derivative of DOTA and labeled with (111)In. The binding of radiolabeled Z(IGF1R:4551) to IGF-1R-expressing cells was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS DOTA-Z(IGF1R:4551) can be stably labeled with (111)In with preserved specific binding to IGF-1R-expressing cells in vitro. In mice, (111)In-DOTA-Z(IGF1R:4551) accumulated in IGF-1R-expressing organs (pancreas, stomach, lung, and salivary gland). Receptor saturation experiments demonstrated that targeting of DU-145 prostate cancer xenografts in NMRI nu/nu mice was IGF-1R-specific. The tumor uptake was 1.1 ± 0.3 percentage injected dose per gram, and the tumor-to-blood ratio was 3.2 ± 0.2 at 8 h after injection. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates the feasibility of in vivo targeting of IGF-1R-expressing prostate cancer xenografts using an Affibody molecule. Further development of radiolabeled Affibody molecules might provide a useful clinical tool for stratification of patients with prostate cancer for IGF-1R-targeting therapy.","Tolmachev, Vladimir; Malmberg, Jennie; Hofström, Camilla; Abrahmsén, Lars; Bergman, Thomas; Sjöberg, Anna; Sandström, Mattias; Gräslund, Torbjörn; Orlova, Anna","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",612,25

METHODS medical charts of 3,694 patients dying with COVID-19 in Italy were reviewed to extract information on demographics, pre-existing comorbidities, and in-hospital complications leading to death. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to assess the association of obesity with non-respiratory complications. These analyses were adjusted for age, gender and number of pre-existing comorbidities. RESULTS obesity was present in 411/3,694 (11.1%) patients dying with COVID-19. Obesity was significantly associated with increased probability of experiencing acute renal failure (adjusted Odds Ratio: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.04-1.71) and shock (adjusted OR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.19-1.99). The associations of obesity with acute renal failure and shock were stronger in patients aged < 60 years (adjusted OR: 2.00; 95% CI: 1.09-3.67 and OR: 2.37; 95% CI 1.29-4.36) than in those aged 60 years or older (adjusted OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 0.90-1.60 and OR: 1.22; 95% CI: 0.91-1.65). CONCLUSIONS In patients dying with COVID-19 in Italy, obesity is associated with an increased probability of non-respiratory complications, particularly shock and acute renal failure. These associations seem stronger in young than in older adults.

The glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) is expressed with a high incidence (>90%) and high density in insulinomas. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), the natural ligand of GLP-1R, is rapidly degraded in vivo. A more stable agonist of GLP-1R is exendin-3. We investigated imaging of insulinomas with DOTA-conjugated exendin-3 labelled with (68)Ga. METHODS Targeting of insulinomas with [Lys(40)(DOTA)]exendin-3 labelled with either (111)In or (68)Ga was investigated in vitro using insulinoma tumour cells (INS-1). [Lys(40)((111)In-DTPA)]Exendin-3 was used as a reference in this study. In vivo targeting was investigated in BALB/c nude mice with subcutaneous INS-1 tumours. PET imaging was performed using a preclinical PET/CT scanner. RESULTS In vitro exendin-3 specifically bound and was internalized by GLP-1R-positive cells. In BALB/c nude mice with subcutaneous INS-1 tumours a high uptake of [Lys(40)((111)In-DTPA)]exendin-3 in the tumour was observed (33.5 +/- 11.6%ID/g at 4 h after injection). Uptake was specific, as determined by coinjection of an excess of unlabelled [Lys(40)]exendin-3 (1.8 +/- 0.1%ID/g). The pancreas also exhibited high and specific uptake (11.3 +/- 1.0%ID/g). High uptake was also found in the kidneys (144 +/- 24%ID/g) and this uptake was not receptor-mediated. In this murine tumour model optimal targeting of the GLP-1R expressing tumour was obtained at exendin doses < or =0.1 microg. Remarkably, tumour uptake of (68)Ga-labelled [Lys(40)(DOTA)]exendin-3 was lower (8.9 +/- 3.1%ID/g) than tumour uptake of (111)In-labelled [Lys(40)(DTPA)]exendin-3 (25.4 +/- 7.2%ID/g). The subcutaneous tumours were clearly visualized by small-animal PET imaging after injection of 3 MBq of [Lys(40)((68)Ga-DOTA)]exendin-3. CONCLUSION [Lys(40)((68)Ga-DOTA)]Exendin-3 specifically accumulates in insulinomas, although the uptake is lower than that of [Lys(40)((111)In-DTPA)]exendin-3. Therefore, [Lys(40)((68)Ga-DOTA)]exendin-3 is a promising tracer to visualize insulinomas with PET.","Brom, Maarten; Oyen, Wim J G; Joosten, Lieke; Gotthardt, Martin; Boerman, Otto C",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,612,33

However, implementation of exercise interventions in real-world settings is challenging. Implementation outcomes are defined as 'the effects of deliberate and purposive actions to implement new treatments, practices, and services'. Measuring implementation outcomes is a practical way of evaluating implementation success. This systematic review explores the implementation outcomes of exercise interventions evaluated under real-world conditions for cancer care. METHODS Using PRISMA guidelines, an electronic database search of Medline, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Web of Science, SportsDiscus, Scopus and Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials was conducted for studies published between January 2000 and February 2020. The Moving through Cancer registry was hand searched. The Implementation Outcomes Framework guided data extraction. Inclusion criteria were adult populations with a cancer diagnosis. Efficacy studies were excluded. RESULTS Thirty-seven articles that described 31 unique programs met the inclusion criteria. Implementation outcomes commonly evaluated were feasibility (unique programs n = 17, 54.8%) and adoption (unique programs n = 14, 45.2%). Interventions were typically delivered in the community (unique programs n = 17, 58.6%), in groups (unique programs n = 14, 48.3%) and supervised by a qualified health professional (unique programs n = 14, 48.3%). Implementation outcomes infrequently evaluated were penetration (unique programs n = 1, 3.2%) and sustainability (unique programs n = 1, 3.2%). CONCLUSIONS Exercise studies need to measure and evaluate implementation outcomes under real-world conditions. Robust measurement and reporting of implementation outcomes can help to identify what strategies are essential for successful implementation of exercise interventions. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS Understanding how exercise interventions can be successful implemented is important so that people living after a cancer diagnosis can derive the benefits of exercise.","Czosnek, Louise; Richards, Justin; Zopf, Eva; Cormie, Prue; Rosenbaum, Simon; Rankin, Nicole M",BMC cancer,612,1

Objectives The objective was to understand the spatial distribution and trends of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Mumbai during the lockdown period and draw insights for effective actions. Methods Spatial and trend analysis was conducted to trace the spread of the virus during the lockdown period in April 2020. The administrative divisions of Mumbai, in the form of wards and zones, have been used as units of analysis. Results Greater Mumbai area occupies only 0.015% of the landmass of India, but is contributing to over 20% of the SARS-CoV-2 cases in India. Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections have increased over 375 times within 50 days of the lockdown. An analysis of trends across the wards during the 3-week period (April 4 to April 25) shows a skewed pattern, with three zones out of six contributing to the vast majority of cases in Mumbai. The wards with higher formal economic activity are relatively less affected than the other wards. The test positivity rate in Mumbai is much higher than the rest of India.

Licensed massage therapists provided the massage or control condition twice a day for 4 weeks. Weekly HRV, a measure of ANS development and function, was analyzed using SPSS generalized estimating equations. RESULTS Infant characteristics were similar between groups. HRV improved in massaged infants but not in the control infants (P<0.05). Massaged males had a greater improvement in HRV than females (P<0.05). HRV in massaged infants was on a trajectory comparable to term-born infants by study completion. CONCLUSION Massage-improved HRV in a homogeneous sample of hospitalized, medically stable, preterm male infants and may improve infant response to exogenous stressors.

Methods A mathematical model with social network analysis approach (SNA) was used to simulate a COVID-19 outbreak. A discrete-time, stochastic simulation model was used to construct COVID-19 spread within the SJ Church. A counterfactual experiment using a calibrated baseline model was conducted to examine the potential benefit of complying with mask-wearing policy. Results Simulations with a mask-wearing percentage of 60.5% (range 55-65%) at the time of the outbreak yielded results most consistent with the confirmed case data. If the church had followed government mask-wearing guidelines, the outbreak might have been one-tenth the size. The counterfactual experiment with 95% mask-wearing estimated an average of 45.6 (95% CI: 43.4-47.9) cases with a standard deviation of 20.1. Discussion SNA is an effective tool for monitoring and controlling outbreaks of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Although our results are based on simulations and thus subject to limitations, the precautionary implication of social distancing and mask-wearing is still relevant. Because person-to-person contact/interaction is unavoidable in social and economic life, it may be wise to consider developing precise measures and guidelines for particular organizations or places that are susceptible to cluster outbreaks.","Kim, Namje; Kang, Su Jin; Tak, Sangwoo",Epidemiology and health,612,31

RECENT FINDINGS Electrolyte disturbances appear to occur often during critical illness, and most of them seem to be associated with impaired outcome. However, a recent systematic review indicated insufficient evidence to answer clinically relevant questions regarding hypophosphatemia. Similar questions (which thresholds of serum levels are clinically relevant; how serum levels should be corrected and how do different correction regimens/approaches influence outcome) are not clearly answered also for other electrolytes. The most crucial feature of electrolyte disturbances related to feeding is refeeding syndrome. Recent evidence supports that additionally to the correction of electrolyte levels, a temporary restriction of calories (reducing the magnitude of this metabolic feature, including electrolyte shifts) may help to improve outcome. SUMMARY Diverse electrolyte disorders often occur in critically ill patients. Hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia that are encountered after initiation of feeding identify refeeding syndrome. Along with correction of electrolytes, reduction of caloric intake may improve the outcome of the refeeding syndrome.","Reintam Blaser, Annika; Hubert van Zanten, Arthur Raymond",Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,612,16

They also are responsible for stressful experiences. There is a perception in the community that work is increasingly the source of much of our stress and distress. Depressive symptoms may be related to repeated stressful experiences. Intensive care unit (ICU) physicians are exposed to major stressors. However, the existence of depressive symptoms in these doctors has been poorly studied. This study was designed to evaluate the prevalence and associated risk factors of depressive symptoms in junior and senior ICU physicians. METHOD A one-day national survey was conducted in adult intensive care units (ICU) in French public hospitals. Symptoms of depression were assessed using the Centers of Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). RESULTS A total of 189 ICUs participated, and 901 surveys were returned (75.8% response rate). Symptoms of depression were found in 23.8% of the respondents using the CES-D scale. Fifty-eight percent of these intensivists presenting symptoms of depression wished to leave their job compared with only 33% of those who did not exhibit signs of depression as assessed by the CES-D scale (p < 0.0001). Multiple logistic regression showed that organizational factors were associated with the presence of depressive symptoms. Workload (long interval since the last nonworking weekend, absence of relief of service until the next working day after a night shift) and impaired relationships with other intensivists were independently associated with the presence of depressive symptoms. A high level of burnout also was related to the presence of depressive symptoms. In contrast, no demographic factors regarding ICU physicians and no factor related to the severity of illness of patients were retained by the model. The quality of relationships with other physicians (from other departments) was associated with the absence of depressive symptoms (protective effect). CONCLUSIONS Approximately one of four intensivists presented symptoms of depression. The next step could be to test whether organization modification is associated with less depressive symptoms and less desire to leave the job.","Embriaco, Nathalie; Hraiech, Sami; Azoulay, Elie; Baumstarck-Barrau, Karine; Forel, Jean-Marie; Kentish-Barnes, Nancy; Pochard, Frédéric; Loundou, Anderson; Roch, Antoine; Papazian, Laurent",Annals of intensive care,612,24

One critical obstacle for the implementation of MIE has been the intrathoracic anastomosis. In this study, we describe a technique of thoracoscopic intrathoracic anastomosis using a linear stapler in prone position and present the short-term outcomes of this procedure. METHODS This prospective pilot study included 46 consecutive patients with a cancer either of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) or the distal esophagus who underwent either total MIE or thoracoscopic-assisted esophagectomy followed by intrathoracic stapled side-to-side anastomosis. The short-term outcomes including postoperative complications were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS This pilot study included 41 males (89 %) and 5 females (11 %) with a mean age of 65.7 years. The majority had adenocarcinoma (93 %). Before surgery, 4 patients (8.7 %) had an incomplete endoscopic submucosal resection, 5 patients (11 %) received chemotherapy alone, and 33 patients (71 %) had chemoradiotherapy. Mean operation time was 408 minutes. Postoperative complications classified as Clavien-Dindo Grade IIIa or more severe occurred in 7 patients (15 %), of whom 4 patients (8.7 %) developed anastomotic leakages without any need for intensive care. Another 2 patients (4.3 %) required intensive care due to aspiration pneumonia and acute renal failure. No in-hospital mortality was registered. Only one patient (2.2 %) with anastomotic leakage developed postoperative anastomotic stenosis requiring balloon dilatation. CONCLUSIONS The intrathoracic stapled side-to-side anastomosis technique seems to be feasible, safe, and easy to perform, associated with a limited postsurgical complication rate and a good functional outcome.","Irino, Tomoyuki; Tsai, Jon A; Ericson, Jessica; Nilsson, Magnus; Lundell, Lars; Rouvelas, Ioannis",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,612,1

Despite near hourly reporting on this crisis, there has been no regular, updated, or accurate reporting of hospitalizations for COVID-19. It is known that many test-positive individuals may not develop symptoms or have a mild self-limited viral syndrome consisting of fever, malaise, dry cough, and constitutional symptoms. However some individuals develop a more fulminant syndrome including viral pneumonia, respiratory failure requiring oxygen, acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation, and in substantial fractions leading to death attributable to COVID-19. The pandemic is evolving in a clustered, non-inform fashion resulting in many hospitals with preparedness but few or no cases, and others that are completely overwhelmed. Thus, a considerable risk of spread when personal protection equipment becomes exhausted and a large fraction of mortality in those not offered mechanical ventilation are both attributable to a crisis due to maldistribution of resources. The pandemic is amenable to self-reporting through a mobile phone application that could obtain critical information on suspected cases and report on the results of self testing and actions taken. The only method to understand the clustering and the immediate hospital resource needs is mandatory, uniform, daily reporting of hospital censuses of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital wards and intensive care units. Current reports of hospitalizations are delayed, uncertain, and wholly inadequate. This paper urges all the relevant stakeholders to take up self-reporting and reporting of hospitalizations of COVID-19 as an urgent task in combating this devastating pandemic.","McCullough, Peter A; Eidt, John; Rangaswami, Janani; Lerma, Edgar; Tumlin, James; Wheelan, Kevin; Katz, Nevin; Lepor, Norman E; Vijay, Kris; Soman, Sandeep; Singh, Bhupinder; McCullough, Sean P; McCullough, Haley B; Palazzuoli, Alberto; Ruocco, Gaetano M; Ronco, Claudio",Reviews in cardiovascular medicine,612,28

METHODS Four-hundred sixty-four patients with acute MCA occlusions were treated with endovascular therapy. RESULTS Two-hundred ninety-three patients had M1 occlusions, 116 had M2, and 55 had M3/4 occlusions. Partial or complete recanalization was more frequently achieved in M1 (76.8%) than in M2 (59.1%) or M3/4 (47.3%, p < 0.001) occlusions, but favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-2) was less frequent in M1 (50.9%) than M2 (63.7%) or M3/4 (72.7%, p = 0.018) occlusions. Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) did not differ between occlusion sites, but asymptomatic ICH was more common in M1 (22.6%) than in M2 occlusions (8.6%, p = 0.003). Recanalization was associated with favorable outcome in M1 (p < 0.001) and proximal M2 (p = 0.003) but not in distal M2 or M3/4 occlusions. CONCLUSIONS Recanalization with endovascular therapy was more frequently achieved in patients with proximal than distal MCA occlusions, but recanalization was associated with favorable outcome only in M1 and proximal M2 occlusions. Outcome was better with distal than proximal occlusions. This study shows that recanalization can be used as a surrogate marker for clinical outcome only in patients with proximal occlusions.","Arnold, Marcel; Slezak, Agnieszka; El-Koussy, Marwan; Lüdi, Rudolf; Findling, Oliver; Mono, Marie-Luise; Heldner, Mirjam Rachel; Fischer, Urs; Mordasini, Pasquale; Schroth, Gerhard; Mattle, Heinrich P; Gralla, Jan; Jung, Simon",European neurology,612,1

Rotaviruses are divided into ten serogroups (A-J) and each group is based on genetic properties of major structural protein VP6. We designed a novel VP6 sequence optimization to increase the expression level of this protein. Numerous factors such as codon adaptation index, codon pair bias, and GC content were adapted based on E. coli codon usage. In addition, the ribosome binding site of pET-15b was redesigned by the RBS calculator and the secondary structure of VP6 mRNA was optimized in the whole length of the coding sequence. Various factors including IPTG concentration, temperature and induction time were analyzed for the optimization of the best expression in E. coli by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. The recombinant VP6 (rVP6) protein was purified by the Ni-sepharose and then the hyper-immune sera were generated against rVP6 in rabbits. Among three different temperatures, IPTG concentrations, and post inductions, the level of rVP6 was higher at 37°C, 1mM of IPTG, and 8 hours, respectively. Also, the high expression level of rVP6 was obtained in the insoluble aggregate form (43.8 g.L-1 ). After purification, the yield of rVP6 was 10.83 g.L-1 . The rVP6 specific antiserum was confirmed by both Immunofluorescent and western blot analyses. The versatile sequence optimization was the reason to produce a high level of rVP6 compared to other reports and can potentially apply to produce cheaper commercial kits in order to diagnose serological tests and new rotavirus vaccines.

Despite the well-known benefits, physical inactivity remains one of the major contributing factors to ill-health throughout industrialized countries. Traditional lifestyle interventions such as group education or telephone counseling are effective at increasing physical activity participation; however, physical activity levels tend to decline over time. Consumer-based wearable activity trackers that allow users to objectively monitor activity levels are now widely available and may offer an alternative method for assisting individuals to remain physically active. OBJECTIVE This review aimed to determine the effects of interventions utilizing consumer-based wearable activity trackers on physical activity participation and sedentary behavior when compared with interventions that do not utilize activity tracker feedback. METHODS A systematic review was performed searching the following databases for studies that included the use of a consumer-based wearable activity tracker to improve physical activity participation: Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials, MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, SPORTDiscus, and Health Technology Assessments. Controlled trials of adults comparing the use of a consumer-based wearable activity tracker with other nonactivity tracker-based interventions were included. The main outcome measures were physical activity participation and sedentary behavior. All studies were assessed for risk of bias, and the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system was used to rank the quality of evidence. The guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement were followed. A random-effects meta-analysis was completed on the included outcome measures to estimate the treatment effect of interventions that included an activity tracker compared with a control group. RESULTS There was a significant increase in daily step count (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.24; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.33; P<.001), moderate and vigorous physical activity (SMD 0.27; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.39; P<.001), and energy expenditure (SMD 0.28; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.54; P=.03) and a nonsignificant decrease in sedentary behavior (SMD -0.20; 95% CI -0.43 to 0.03; P=.08) following the intervention versus control comparator across all studies in the meta-analyses. In general, included studies were at low risk of bias, except for performance bias. Heterogeneity varied across the included meta-analyses ranging from low (I2=3%) for daily step count through to high (I2=67%) for sedentary behavior. CONCLUSIONS Utilizing a consumer-based wearable activity tracker as either the primary component of an intervention or as part of a broader physical activity intervention has the potential to increase physical activity participation. As the effects of physical activity interventions are often short term, the inclusion of a consumer-based wearable activity tracker may provide an effective tool to assist health professionals to provide ongoing monitoring and support.","Brickwood, Katie-Jane; Watson, Greig; O'Brien, Jane; Williams, Andrew D",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,612,1

In this piece, we argue that these changes invite researchers to consider the short and longer-term consequences in terms of continuities and changes to the practices and symbolism of alcohol consumption both within and beyond domestic spaces. We do this by drawing on illustrations from our emergent qualitative research involving internet-mediated semi-structured interviews and focus groups with 20 participants from the UK (aged 26-65) concerning experiences of drinking in and beyond 'lockdown'. In sharing these early findings, we hope to highlight themes relevant to understanding drinking behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic and to stimulate dialogue for immediate research priorities in this area. Key topic areas in our data appear to concern; variability in heavy/moderate/light/non-drinking practices while drinking at home, lockdown as an opportunity to reassess relationships with alcohol, and the symbolic role of alcohol in internet-mediated communications and interactions. Longstanding policymaker and practitioner concerns with managing public drinking and public order may have been unsettled by a growth in home-based drinking, although, as we argue, such changes were in motion before the global pandemic. We propose that a greater understanding of the challenges and opportunities the pandemic presents for (re)negotiating relationships with alcohol may offer wider lessons around how individuals and communities might be supported via innovative policy measures to change their relationships with alcohol both during and beyond lockdown.","Nicholls, Emily; Conroy, Dominic",The International journal on drug policy,612,12

Cattle was proposed as the natural reservoir of IDV in which infection was associated with mild to moderate respiratory clinical signs (i.e. cough, nasal discharge, and dyspnoea). METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS In order to investigate the role of IDV in bovine respiratory disease, during the period 2017-2020, 883 nasal or naso-pharyngeal swabs from Canadian cattle with respiratory signs (cough and/or dyspnoea) were tested by (RT-)qPCR for IDV and other major bovine viral (bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine parainfluenza virus 3, and bovine coronavirus) and bacterial (Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, and Mycoplasma bovis) respiratory pathogens. In addition, whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were carried out on five IDV positive samples. The prevalence of IDV RT-qPCR (with cut-off: Cq < 38) at animal level was estimated at 5.32% (95% confidence interval: 3.94-7.02). Positive result of IDV was significantly associated with (RT-)qPCR positive results for bovine respiratory syncytial virus and Mycoplasma bovis. While phylogenetic analyses indicate that most segments belonged to clade D/660, reassortment between clades D/660 and D/OK were evidenced in four samples collected in 2018-2020. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE Relative importance of influenza D virus and associated pathogens in bovine respiratory disease of Canadian dairy cattle was established. Whole genome sequencing demonstrated evidence of reassortment between clades D/660 and D/OK.

This study compared COVID-19-related outcomes in pregnant women versus non-pregnant women after adjusting for potential risk factors for severe outcomes. METHODS Data were obtained from the COVID-19 National Data Registry of Mexico, which is an ongoing prospective cohort of people of any age with clinically suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and admitted to 475 monitoring hospitals. This study included pregnant and non-pregnant women of reproductive age (15-49 y) with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. To adjust for underlying risk factors, propensity score matching was conducted for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, smoking, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, and age. The primary outcome was death. Secondary outcomes were pneumonia, intubation, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS The initial sample comprised of 5183 pregnant and 175,908 non-pregnant COVID-19 patients. The crude (unmatched) rates of death, pneumonia, intubation, and ICU admission in pregnant and non-pregnant women were 1.5% vs. 1.5%, 9.9% vs. 6.5%, 8.1% vs. 9.9%, 13.0% vs. 6.9%, respectively. After propensity score matching (5183 pregnant- and 5183 non-pregnant matched women), pregnant women had higher odds of death (odds ratio [OR] 1·65, 95% CI 1·30-2.09), pneumonia (OR 1·99, 95% CI 1·81-2·19) and ICU admission (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1·86-2·71) than non-pregnant women, but similar odds of intubation (OR 0·93, 95% CI 0·70-1·25).

The imaging findings of viral pneumonia are diverse and overlap with those of other nonviral infectious and inflammatory conditions. However, identification of the underlying viral pathogens may not always be easy. There are a number of indicators for identifying viral pathogens on the basis of imaging patterns, which are associated with the pathogenesis of viral infections. Viruses in the same viral family share a similar pathogenesis of pneumonia, and the imaging patterns have distinguishable characteristics. Although not all cases manifest with typical patterns, most typical imaging patterns of viral pneumonia can be classified according to viral families. Although a definite diagnosis cannot be achieved on the basis of imaging features alone, recognition of viral pneumonia patterns may aid in differentiating viral pathogens, thus reducing the use of antibiotics. Recently, new viruses associated with recent outbreaks including human metapneumovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus have been discovered. The imaging findings of these emerging pathogens have been described in a few recent studies. This review focuses on the radiographic and computed tomographic patterns of viral pneumonia caused by different pathogens, including new pathogens. Clinical characteristics that could affect imaging, such as patient age and immune status, seasonal variation and community outbreaks, and pathogenesis, are also discussed. The first goal of this review is to indicate that there are imaging features that should raise the possibility of viral infections. Second, to help radiologists differentiate viral infections, viruses in the same viridae that have similar pathogenesis and can have similar imaging characteristics are shown. By considering both the clinical and radiologic characteristics, radiologists can suggest the diagnosis of viral pneumonia. ©RSNA, 2018.","Koo, Hyun Jung; Lim, Soyeoun; Choe, Jooae; Choi, Sang-Ho; Sung, Heungsup; Do, Kyung-Hyun","Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North America, Inc",612,28

Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been identified as a gold standard test with Chest CT and Chest Radiography showing promising results as well. However, radiological solutions have not been used extensively for the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease, partly due to radiation risk. This study aimed to provide quantitative comparison of imaging radiation risk versus COVID risk. METHODS The analysis was performed in terms of mortality rate per age group. COVID-19 mortality was extracted from epidemiological data across 299,004 patients published by ISS-Integrated surveillance of COVID-19 in Italy. For radiological risk, the study considered 659 Chest CT performed in adult patients. Organ doses were estimated using a Monte Carlo method and then used to calculate Risk Index that was converted into an upper bound for related mortality rate following NCI-SEER data. RESULTS COVID-19 mortality showed a rapid rise for ages >30 years old (min:0.30%; max:30.20%), whereas only 1 death was reported in the analyzed patient cohort for ages <20 years old. The rates decreased for radiation risk across age groups. The median mortality rate across all ages for Chest-CT and Chest-Radiography were 0.007% (min:0.005%; max:0.011%) and 0.0003% (min:0.0002%; max:0.0004%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19, Chest Radiography, and Chest CT mortality rates showed different magnitudes and trends across age groups. In higher ages, the risk of COVID-19 far outweighs that of radiological exams. Based on risk comparison alone, Chest Radiography and CT for COVID-19 care is justified for patients older than 20 and 30 years old, respectively. Notwithstanding other aspects of diagnosis, the present results capture a component of risk consideration associated with the use of imaging for COVID. Once integrated with other diagnostic factors, they may help inform better management of the pandemic.","Ria, Francesco; Fu, Wanyi; Chalian, Hamid; Abadi, Ehsan; Segars, Paul W; Fricks, Rafael; Khoshpouri, Pegah; Samei, Ehsan",Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,612,5

Dumping syndrome, intolerance to RYGB-induced restriction, and weight loss issues are possible problems bariatric surgeons are confronted with. This study reports the feasibility, safety, and outcomes of laparoscopic reconversion of RYGB to original anatomy (OA) as treatment of these complications. METHODS Between January 2005 and April 2008, eight patients benefited from laparoscopic reconversion of RYGB to OA. Reason was dumping syndrome without postprandial hypoglycemia (three), intolerance to RYGB-induced restriction (three), too much (one) and too little weight loss (one). Mean weight and body mass index (BMI) at RYGB were 104.7±19.3 kg and 38.7±6 kg/m(2), respectively. Four patients suffered of obesity co-morbidities. Mean time between RYGB and reconversion was 21±18.8 months. Mean weight, BMI, and % excess weight loss at reconversion was 66.8±21.7 kg, 20.1±7 kg/m(2), and 23.7±55%, respectively. The procedure involved dismantling both gastrojejunostomy and jejunojejunostomy, reanastomosing gastric pouch to gastric remnant, and proximal alimentary limb end to distal biliary limb end. RESULTS Mean operative time was 132.2±29.5 min. There were no conversions to open surgery and no early complications. Gastrogastrostomy was performed manually (four) and by linear stapler (four), and jejunojejunostomy by linear stapler (eight). Mean hospital stay was 7.7±3.5 days. After a mean follow-up of 18.3±9.2 months, two patients continued to further lose weight, two patients maintained the same weight, and four patients presented weight regain. Gastroesophageal reflux disease appeared in three patients. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic reconversion of RYGB to OA is feasible and safe. Dumping syndrome and intolerance to RYGB-induced restriction are resolved. The anatomy remains one of the aspects besides nutritional and psychological factors in cases of reconversion for weight issues.","Dapri, Giovanni; Cadière, Guy Bernard; Himpens, Jacques",Obesity surgery,612,1

In the current study, isoflurane administration was guided to a bispectral index range of 55-60. Intra-operative responsiveness, as assessed by the isolated forearm technique, was compared with whether the bispectral index predicted/identified a patient's appropriate hand movements in response to commands. Thirty-four women underwent major gynaecological surgery with isoflurane/air and atracurium. Eleven women responded on 32 occasions with appropriate hand movements to commands given during surgery, of which the bispectral index detected 17 (sensitivity 53%). The bispectral index suggested consciousness 660 times in the absence of any movement responses (specificity 69%). The positive predictive value of the bispectral index was 3%. The median (IQR [range]) bispectral index value associated with an intra-operative response was significantly lower than that associated with eye opening after surgery: 60 (50-68 [36-83]) vs 77 (75-84 [59-90]), respectively (p = 2.25 × 10(-8)). Conversely, end-tidal isoflurane concentration was significantly higher at intra-operative response than at eye opening: 0.3 (0.3-0.4 [0.2-0.9]) vs 0.2 (0.1-0.2 [0.1-0.3]), respectively (p = 7.36 × 10(-8)). For patients who responded more than once during surgery, the bispectral index value associated with a response was not constant. No patient had recall for surgery or the taped commands, and only one could remember dreaming (a good dream). Titrating isoflurane to target a bispectral index range of 55-60 may result in an unacceptable number of patients who are conscious during surgery (albeit without recall).","Russell, I F",Anaesthesia,612,17

A new identity polarization has arisen between Remain and Leave sympathizers in the UK Brexit debate, with associated accusations of misinformation use.

We harness insights from political science, cognitive neuroscience and psychology to examine the impact of trust and identity on information processing regarding Brexit in a group of Remain identifiers. Behaviourally, participants' affective responses to Brexit-related information are affected by whether the emotional valence of the message is compatible with their beliefs on Brexit (positive/negative) but not by their trust in the source of information. However, belief in the information is significantly affected by both (dis)trust in information source and by belief compatibility with the valence of the information. Neuroimaging results confirm this pattern, identifying areas involved in judgements of the self, others and automatic processing of affectively threatening stimuli, ultimately supporting motivated cognition accounts of misinformation endorsement.

Although opioids such as morphine are considered essential medicines in the provision of palliative care and for treating cancer pain, especially when the pain is severe, low- and middle-income countries often lack such medications. AIM The primary aim of this study was to examine countries' government and health-care system influences on opioid availability for cancer pain and palliative care, as a means to identify implications for improving appropriate access to prescription opioids. DESIGN A multivariate regression of 177 countries' consumption of opioids (in milligrams/death from cancer and AIDS) contained country-level predictor variables related to public health, including Human Development Index, palliative care infrastructure, and health system resources and expenditures. RESULTS Results were highly explanatory (adjusted R(2) = 82%) and Human Development Index was the most predictive variable when controlling for all other factors in the statistical model (B = 11.875, confidence interval = 10.216, 13.534, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Study findings demonstrate that a limited number of predictor variables characterizing a country's government and health-care system infrastructure can explain its opioid consumption level, with the greatest influence being very high Human Development Index. However, Human Development Index is not the most policy-relevant factor, and this finding should be reconciled against the reality that many countries with low or medium Human Development Index have succeeded in creating and sustaining a health-care system to strengthen cancer pain care and palliative care, including through the appropriate use of essential prescription opioids.","Gilson, Aaron M; Maurer, Martha A; Lebaron, Virginia T; Ryan, Karen M; Cleary, James F",Palliative medicine,612,16

Additionally, secondary measures of balance, walking speed and capacity, and the PDQ-39 ratings improved with bicycling. The interventions varied in durations, intensities and target cadences. Conclusively, bicycling is particularly beneficial for the motor performance of PD patients, improving crucial features of gait.

Studies have been conducted in the mouse due to their relatively higher transparency and long term patency of a chronic cranial window. Increasing availability of transgenic rat models, and the range of established behavioural paradigms, necessitates development of a chronic preparation for the rat. However, surgical craniotomies in the rat present challenges due to craniotomy closure by wound healing and diminished image quality due to inflammation, restricting most rat TPFM experiments to acute preparations. Long-term patency is enabled by employing sterile surgical technique, minimization of trauma with precise tissue handling during surgery, judicious selection of the size and placement of the craniotomy, diligent monitoring of animal physiology and support throughout the surgery, and modification of the home cage for long-term preservation of cranial implants. Immunohistochemical analysis employing the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 (Iba-1) showed activation and recruitment of astrocytes and microglia/macrophages directly inferior to the cranial window at one week after surgery, with more diffuse response in deeper cortical layers at two weeks, and amelioration around four weeks post craniotomy. TPFM was conducted up to 14 weeks post craniotomy, reaching cortical depths of 400 µm to 600 µm at most time-points. The rate of signal decay with increasing depth and maximum cortical depth attained had greater variation between individual rats at a single time-point than within a rat across time.","Koletar, Margaret M; Dorr, Adrienne; Brown, Mary E; McLaurin, JoAnne; Stefanovic, Bojana",Scientific reports,612,1

The induction of regulatory macrophages can be potentiated using the combination of anti-TNF and thiopurines, consistent with the enhanced efficacy of this combination therapy described in clinical trials. As thiopurines are unfortunately associated with significant side effects, we here aimed to identify alternatives for combination therapy with anti-TNF, using the macrophage induction model as a screening tool. Methods Mixed lymphocyte reactions were treated with anti-TNF and a library of 1600 drug compounds. Induction of CD14+CD206+ macrophages was analysed by flow cytometry. Positive hits were validated in vitro and in the T cell transfer model of colitis. Results Among the 98 compounds potentiating the induction of regulatory macrophages by anti-TNF were six benzimidazoles, including albendazole. Albendazole treatment in the presence of anti-TNF resulted in alterations in the tubulin skeleton and signalling though AMPK, which was required for the enhanced induction. Combination therapy also increased expression levels of the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10. In vivo, albendazole plus anti-TNF combination therapy was superior to monotherapy in a model of colitis, in terms of both induction of regulatory macrophages and improvement of clinical symptoms. Conclusions Albendazole enhances the induction of regulatory macrophages by anti-TNF and potentiates clinical efficacy in murine colitis. Given its favourable safety profile, these data indicate that the repurposing of albendazole may be a novel option for anti-TNF combination therapy in IBD.","Wildenberg, Manon E; Levin, Alon D; Ceroni, Alessandro; Guo, Zhen; Koelink, Pim J; Hakvoort, Theodorus B M; Westera, Liset; Bloemendaal, Felicia M; Brandse, Johannan F; Simmons, Alison; D'Haens, Geert R; Ebner, Daniel; van den Brink, Gijs R",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,612,1

We hypothesize that donor characteristic including race/ethnicity, age, sex, body mass index, and diagnostic groups influences HSPC mobilization. Diagnostic groups include healthy allogeneic donors, autologous multiple myeloma (MM) and non-MM donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Here, we conducted a single-center retrospective study in 64 autologous patients and 48 allogeneic donors. Autologous donors were patients diagnosed with MM or non-MM. All donors were grouped as African American (AA), White (W), or ""Other""(O). RESULTS Multivariate analysis demonstrated diagnostic group differences for CD34+ cell yields between race/ethnicity. Specifically, non-MM patients had the lowest CD34+ cell yields in AA and O, but not in W. For pre-apheresis peripheral blood (PB) CD34+ cell numbers, race/ethnicity had a significant effect both in bivariate and multivariate analyses. Non-MM patients had the lowest, and AA patients had the highest PB CD34+ cells. The results support the view that past therapies used in MM are likely more conducive of recovery of HSPC. CONCLUSIONS Our study shows that race/ethnicity and diagnostic group differences influenced CD34+ cell mobilization response across donor types. Interestingly, autologous MM donors with the aid of plerixafor displayed comparable CD34 yields to allogeneic donors.

Emerging evidences indicate that MCM2-7 (MCMs) are highly expressed in tissues from various malignant tumors. However, little is known about the clinical values of MCMs in breast cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS In our study, a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis was performed to investigate expression patterns, potential functions, and prognostic values of MCMs in breast cancer, through ONCOMINE, bc-GenExMiner v4.1, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, cBioPortal and GeneMANIA databases. RESULTS We found that mRNA levels of MCMs were significantly elevated in breast cancer, especially in fast-growing and spreading tumor subtypes. These over-expressed MCMs predicted worse prognosis for breast cancer patients with shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival. Among these six factors, high expression of MCM2/4/5/7 significantly reduced the RFS for patients with Luminal-A or B breast cancer and elevated MCM6/7 indicated shorter RFS for patients with basal-like or HER2-positive breast cancer. We also found that genomic alteration of MCMs was frequently found in breast cancer and the most common alteration was mRNA upregulation and amplification. Furthermore, MCMs were highly correlated with CDC45, CDC7, TIMELESS, ORC6, MCM10, ORC5, ORC4 and ORC3, mainly functioning to control the DNA replication initiation and genome stability. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that MCMs are attractive prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer. Our study also provides useful clinical information about the potential of MCMs as therapeutic targets.","Cheng, Lin; Tan, Zhangmin; Huang, Zenan; Pan, Yuhang; Zhang, Wenhui; Wang, Jiani",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,612,1

The databases of the Departments of Hematology and Oncology of the University Hospitals of Jena and Rostock were screened for patients aged 18 years or older for onset of MS after HSCT for myeloid malignancies between 2002 and 2019. Nineteen patients with MS were identified, the majority of whom had received reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC). The median onset of MS was 425 days after HSCT and the median overall survival since MS was 234 days. Although MS is associated with a poor prognosis, three patients survived more than two years and one more than 11 years after MS onset. These results indicate that RIC protocols may be associated with a higher risk of EM relapse. Since EM relapse occurred in the presence of Graft-versus-host-disease, these observations also demonstrate the limitations of graft-versus-tumor effects after HSCT. In conclusion, occurrence of MS after HSCT is associated with a poor prognosis, as multimodal curative concepts including intensive chemotherapy and another HSCT are often not viable.","Frietsch, Jochen J; Hunstig, Friederike; Wittke, Christoph; Junghanss, Christian; Franiel, Tobias; Scholl, Sebastian; Hochhaus, Andreas; Hilgendorf, Inken",Bone marrow transplantation,612,1

We here report a single-step optical method for identification and quantification of different compositions of sialoglycans on glycoproteins and in serum. This was achieved by measuring and quantifying nanometal surface energy transfer (NSET) signals between quantum dots and gold nanoparticles bound to specific sialic acid binding proteins (SBPs) and sialic acid moieties, respectively. The biosensing process is based on the NSET turn-on by external sialic acid species that compete for binding to the SBPs. Selectivity of the biosensor toward sialoglycans can be designed to detect the total amount, glycosylation linkages (α2-6 vs α2-3), and modifications (9-O-acetyl and N-glycolyl groups) in the samples. This nanobiosensor is a prototype expected to achieve limits of the detection down to the micromolar range for high-throughput quantification and analysis of different compositions of sialoglycans present in biological or biomedical samples.","Kikkeri, Raghavendra; Padler-Karavani, Vered; Diaz, Sandra; Verhagen, Andrea; Yu, Hai; Cao, Hongzhi; Langereis, Martijn A; De Groot, Raoul J; Chen, Xi; Varki, Ajit",Analytical chemistry,612,16

METHODS Articles and information sourced from search engines including PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Google Scholar were supplemented by literature known to the mood disorders committee (e.g. books, book chapters and government reports) and from published depression and bipolar disorder guidelines. Relevant information was appraised and discussed in detail by members of the mood disorders committee, with a view to formulating and developing consensus-based recommendations and clinical guidance. The guidelines were subjected to rigorous consultation and external review involving: expert and clinical advisors, key stakeholders, professional bodies and specialist groups with interest in mood disorders. RESULTS The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists mood disorders clinical practice guidelines 2020 (MDcpg2020) provide up-to-date guidance regarding the management of mood disorders that is informed by evidence and clinical experience. The guideline is intended for clinical use by psychiatrists, psychologists, primary care physicians and others with an interest in mental health care.

However, in emergencies or point-of-care situations, acquiring an ECG is often not an option, hence motivating the need for alternative temporal synchronization methods. Here, we propose Echo-SyncNet, a self-supervised learning framework to synchronize various cross-sectional 2D echo series without any human supervision or external inputs. The proposed framework takes advantage of two types of supervisory signals derived from the input data: spatiotemporal patterns found between the frames of a single cine (intra-view self-supervision) and interdependencies between multiple cines (inter-view self-supervision). The combined supervisory signals are used to learn a feature-rich and low dimensional embedding space where multiple echo cines can be temporally synchronized. Two intra-view self-supervisions are used, the first is based on the information encoded by the temporal ordering of a cine (temporal intra-view) and the second on the spatial similarities between nearby frames (spatial intra-view). The inter-view self-supervision is used to promote the learning of similar embeddings for frames captured from the same cardiac phase in different echo views. We evaluate the framework with multiple experiments: 1) Using data from 998 patients, Echo-SyncNet shows promising results for synchronizing Apical 2 chamber and Apical 4 chamber cardiac views, which are acquired spatially perpendicular to each other; 2) Using data from 3070 patients, our experiments reveal that the learned representations of Echo-SyncNet outperform a supervised deep learning method that is optimized for automatic detection of fine-grained cardiac cycle phase; 3) We go one step further and show the usefulness of the learned representations in a one-shot learning scenario of cardiac key-frame detection. Without any fine-tuning, key frames in 1188 validation patient studies are identified by synchronizing them with only one labeled reference cine. We do not make any prior assumption about what specific cardiac views are used for training, and hence we show that Echo-SyncNet can accurately generalize to views not present in its training set.

Although considerable resources are spent on developing and evaluating these tools with the aim of increasing access to care, current evidence suggests they are not made available to end users, reducing their impact and creating potential research waste. METHODS This study consisted of 2 components: (1) a systematic review of eHealth tools for pediatric pain assessment and/or management published in the past 10 years, and (2) an online survey, completed by the authors of identified tools, of tool availability, perceived barriers or facilitators to availability, grant funding used, and a validated measure of user-centeredness of the design process (UCD-11). RESULTS Ninety articles (0.86% of citations screened) describing 53 tools met inclusion criteria. Twenty-six survey responses were completed (49.06%), 13 of which (50.00%) described available tools. Commonly endorsed facilitators of tool availability included researchers' beliefs in tool benefits to the target population and research community; barriers included lack of infrastructure and time. The average cost of each unavailable tool was $314,425.31 USD ($3,144,253.06 USD total, n = 10). Authors of available tools were more likely to have followed user-centered design principles and reported higher total funding. CONCLUSION Systemic changes to academic and funding structures could better support eHealth tool availability and may reduce potential for research waste. User-centered design and implementation science methods could improve the availability of eHealth tools and should be further explored in future studies.","Higgins, Kristen S; Tutelman, Perri R; Chambers, Christine T; Witteman, Holly O; Barwick, Melanie; Corkum, Penny; Grant, Doris; Stinson, Jennifer N; Lalloo, Chitra; Robins, Sue; Orji, Rita; Jordan, Isabel",Pain reports,612,1

Objective To assess the economic security, food security, health, and sexual behavior of women at high risk of HIV infection in rural Kenya during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants This survey study of women enrolled in a randomized trial in a rural county in Kenya combined results from phone interviews, conducted while social distancing measures were in effect between May 13 and June 29, 2020, with longitudinal, in-person surveys administered between September 1, 2019, and March 25, 2020. Enrolled participants were HIV-negative and had 2 or more sexual partners within the past month. Surveys collected information on economic conditions, food security, health status, and sexual behavior. Subgroup analyses compared outcomes by reliance on transactional sex for income and by educational attainment. Data were analyzed between May 2020 and April 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures Self-reported income, employment hours, numbers of sexual partners and transactional sex partners, food security, and COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Results A total of 1725 women participated, with a mean (SD) age of 29.3 (6.8) years and 1170 (68.0%) reporting sex work as an income source before the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, participants reported experiencing a 52% decline in mean (SD) weekly income, from $11.25 (13.46) to $5.38 (12.51) (difference, -$5.86; 95% CI, -$6.91 to -$4.82; P < .001). In all, 1385 participants (80.3%) reported difficulty obtaining food in the past month, and 1500 (87.0%) worried about having enough to eat at least once. Reported numbers of sexual partners declined from a mean (SD) total of 1.8 (1.2) partners before COVID-19 to 1.1 (1.0) during (difference, -0.75 partners; 95% CI, -0.84 to -0.67 partners; P < .001), and transactional sex partners declined from 1.0 (1.1) to 0.5 (0.8) (difference, -0.57 partners; 95% CI, -0.64 to -0.50 partners; P < .001). In subgroup analyses, women reliant on transactional sex for income were 18.3% (95% CI, 11.4% to 25.2%) more likely to report being sometimes or often worried that their household would have enough food than women not reliant on transactional sex (P < .001), and their reported decline in employment was 4.6 hours (95% CI, -7.9 to -1.2 hours) greater than women not reliant on transactional sex (P = .008). Conclusions and Relevance In this survey study, COVID-19 was associated with large reductions in economic security among women at high risk of HIV infection in Kenya. However, shifts in sexual behavior may have temporarily decreased their risk of HIV infection.","Kavanagh, Nolan M; Marcus, Noora; Bosire, Risper; Otieno, Brian; Bair, Elizabeth F; Agot, Kawango; Thirumurthy, Harsha",JAMA network open,612,1

Richard Ger introduced the endoscopic approach for the repair of groin hernias in 1991.The endoscopic technique follows the basic principle of preperitoneal placement of a polypropylene mesh over the myopectineal orifice. During the course of dissection of the preperitoneal space, occult obturator and femoral hernias were discovered. METHODS Patients who underwent endoscopic totally extraperitoneal repair of inguinal hernias over a period of 2 years were included in this retrospective study. RESULTS A total of 305 cases of groin hernias were operated in 208 patients over a period of 2 years from January 2010 to January 2012 in a single institution. Eleven synchronous clinically occult obturator hernias were found in 8 patients (3.84%) and 5 synchronous clinically occult femoral hernias were found in 5 patients (2.40%) during repair. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative and perioperative findings were discordant in quite a few cases. Preperitoneal dissection discovered coincidental occult hernias in 6.25% of patients.","Rath, Alok; Bhatia, Parveen; Kalhan, Sudhir; John, Suviraj; Khetan, Mukund; Bindal, Vivek; Ali, Asfar; Singh, Rahul","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",612,1

The aim of this study is to assess whether teaching echocardiography to preclinical medical students using an e-learning software (ELS) is practical and appropriate. METHODS From 2017 to 2019, 1084 second-year medical students at Indiana University School of Medicine were introduced to echocardiography by using the ELS. In 2017 and 2018 students had a postcourse survey to assess echocardiography appropriateness and cardiology learning. Students in 2018 and 2019 were assessed for any association between the use of the ELS and learning cardiology by comparing examination scores. RESULTS In 2017-2018, 127 students responded to the survey (18% response rate). In 2017, 79% of responders and in 2018, 89% reported that introducing echocardiography to medical students is appropriate. In 2017, 78% and in 2018, 87% reported that it improved the understanding of cardiology. Student ELS usage was high for 2017-2018 (93% and 70%) but dropped in 2019 (30%). In 2018 and 2019, students who used ELS did statistically significantly better on the examination (total scores 84% vs. 82% (P = .008) in 2018; 84% vs. 81% (P = .002) in 2019). CONCLUSIONS Many 2nd year medical students felt learning echocardiography with ELS was appropriate and enhanced their learning cardiology. Using echocardiography to help learn cardiology appears to be supported with an association of ELS usage and improved examination scores. Our study suggests that echocardiography learning can and probably should begin in medical school.","Torabi, Asad J; Feigenbaum, Harvey; Bateman, Pantila V",Echocardiography,612,31

PATIENTS AND METHODS After IRB approval, 17 patients with suspected SBTs were prospectively included. Radiation dose was compared to 34 matched patients (2 for 1) for age, gender and body weight, who had undergone CT-enteroclysis with neutral contrast (CTE). Performance of VE was evaluated through comparison with the current standard of reference, including surgery and/or enteroscopy and/or follow-up. RESULTS Tolerance was excellent in 16/17 patients (94%). The radiation dose was lower for VE than for CTE (533 ± 282 vs. 974 ± 505 mGy.cm; p = 0.002). With VE, a total of 25 polyps >5 mm in size were depicted in 12/17 patients. On a per-lesion analysis, sensitivity and positive predictive value of VE were 92.0% and 92.0%, respectively. On a per-segment analysis VE had a sensitivity and specificity of 95.0% and 87.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION Our preliminary study suggests that VE is a feasible and well-tolerated technique with high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of SBT. KEY POINTS • Virtual enteroscopy is feasible and well tolerated. • Virtual enteroscopy appears to be accurate for detection of small-bowel tumours. • Sensitivity and PPV of virtual enteroscopy is 92.0% and 92.0%. • Radiation dose is lower with virtual enteroscopy compared to MDCT-enteroclysis.","Dohan, Anthony; Boudiaf, Mourad; Dray, Xavier; Samaha, Elia; Cellier, Christophe; Camus, Marine; Eveno, Clarisse; Dautry, Raphael; Soyer, Philippe",European radiology,612,1

AIMS The purpose of this study was to evaluate a possible limitation of the Surgi-Wrap(®) anti-adhesion material during clinical follow-up of surgically managed gynaecological malignancies. METHODS We retrospectively analysed the medical records and imaging findings of 92 patients who received the Surgi-Wrap(®) anti-adhesion material. RESULTS Nine of the 92 patients had local recurrence based on the imaging findings. The positive imaging findings showed focal, isolated and small pelvic lesions without other distant metastasis or recurrence and normal tumour marker levels. Laparoscopic exploration and biopsy were performed in six patients and close clinical follow-up was performed for the other three patients, who had a strong diagnostic impression of a foreign body reaction mimicking a focal recurrence of the tumour. The histological findings of the six laparoscopically-explored patients revealed a foreign body reaction without malignancy in five and recurrence in one case. The rate of foreign body reaction, mimicking a local recurrence, was 5/92 (5.4% of histologically confirmed cases) and 8/92 cases had ambiguous findings between a foreign reaction and local recurrence (8.7% of clinically suspected cases). CONCLUSIONS It is important to avoid confusion between benign and recurrent conditions during follow-up for gynaecological malignancies.

METHODS We conducted a follow-up study on children whose mothers participated in a randomized clinical trial to receive placebo, 150 µg/day or 300 µg/day of iodine until 12 months postpartum. Child neurocognitive development was assessed at 36 months of age using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition. Linear mixed-model analysis was preformed to assess iodine supplement dose effects on child cognitive, language, and motor functions. RESULTS A total of 122 children provided neurodevelopmental data as follows: 300 µg/d iodine group: 45; 150 µg/d iodine group: 35; and placebo group: 42. Cognitive scores were higher in children whose mothers received 150 µg iodine/d compared to children whose mothers received placebo [102.8 (SD 13.2) vs. 99.2 (SD 10.5); β = 4.43, P = 0.032]. However, supplementation with 150 µg iodine/d had no effect on language or motor development. No significant differences were observed in cognitive, language, or motor functions between children whose mothers received 300 µg iodine/d and those whose mothers received 150 µg iodine/d or placebo. CONCLUSION Maternal iodine supplementation with 150 µg/d during lactation may have a beneficial effect on child cognitive development; however, we found no evidence of either improved or delayed neurodevelopmental outcomes in children whose mothers received iodine supplements at doses higher than recommended. Further randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these results.

Venous blood was collected from healthy women (n=196), aged between 19-45 years with an uncomplicated singleton pregnancy, at term (37-40 weeksâ gestation) and on day 1 and day 3 postpartum for the measurement of CRP and PCT. RESULTS The reference population comprised of 189 participants: term pregnancy (n=51), postpartum day 1 vaginal delivery (VD, n=70) and caesarean section (CS, n=38) and day 3 (CS, n=30). The maximum PCT value at term pregnancy was 0.1Âµg/L. On day 1 postpartum, 90% and 86.8% of PCT results for VD and CS respectively were below the decision-threshold of 0.25 Âµg/L. The specificity of PCT to rule out infection in the reference population was 91.5%. CONCLUSIONS Reference values for PCT were established in a well-characterised population of healthy pregnant women at term and immediately postpartum. The variability of CRP limits its clinical utility in the assessment of systemic sepsis. Application of the PCT cut-off of 0.25 Âµg/L in this population will be a valuable adjunct to clinicians ruling out infection in pregnancy and postpartum.","Joyce, Caroline; Deasy, Shane; Abu, Hala; Yin Lim, Yoke; O'Shea, Paula; O'Donoghue, Keelin",Annals of clinical biochemistry,612,31

We illustrate that this novel structure allows for much higher water permeability when used as a support for reverse osmosis thin-film composite membranes. Reinforcement and lamination of the aligned nanofibres generates mechanically robust structures that retain very high porosity and low tortuosity when applied to high pressure desalination operations. The cross-hatched nanofibre layers support the polyamide active layer firmly and reduce resistance to water flow due to the high porosity, low tortuosity, high mechanical strength and minimal thickness of the structures. The nanofibre composite membrane gives a water flux significantly greater than when a traditional support layer is used, at 99 ± 5 m-2 h-1 with NaCl rejection of 98.7 % at 15.5 bar.","Kim, Seungju; Heath, Daniel E; Kentish, Sandra E",ACS applied materials & interfaces,612,1

Expanding criteria for transplant candidacy, improved diagnostics for risk stratification and advances in prognostic models have paralleled recent changes in allocation and distribution that require us to revisit core concepts of candidate evaluation and selection while recognizing its now dynamic and continuous nature. RECENT FINDINGS The liver transplant evaluation revolves around three interrelated themes: candidate selection, donor selection and transplant outcome. Introduction of dynamic frailty indices, bariatric surgery at the time of liver transplant in obese patients and improved therapies and prognostic tools for hepatobiliary malignancy have transformed candidate selection. Advances in hypothermic organ preservation have improved outcomes in marginal donor organs. Combined with expansion of hepatitis C virus positive and split donor organs, donor selection has become an integral part of candidate evaluation. In addition, with liver transplant for acute alcohol-related hepatitis now widely performed and increasing recognition of acute-on-chronic liver failure, selection of critically ill patients is refining tools to balance futility versus utility. SUMMARY Advances in liver transplant candidate evaluation continue to transform the evaluation process and require continued incorporation into our clinical practice amidst a dynamic backdrop of demographic and policy changes.","Kriss, Michael; Biggins, Scott W",Current opinion in organ transplantation,612,16

Previous studies have suggested that serum carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (%dCDT) levels, relative to blood alcohol levels (BALs), may better differentiate episodic binge drinkers from sustained heavy consumers in admitted patients with traumatic injury. We characterized %dCDT levels and BAL levels to differentiate binge drinkers from sustained heavy consumers in admitted trauma patients and their associations with outcomes. METHODS This prospective, cross-sectional, observational study assessed %dCDT and BAL levels in admitted male and female patients with traumatic injury (≥18 y) at an American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma level-1 center from July 2014 to June 2016. We designated patients with %dCDT levels ≥1.7% (CDT+) as chronic alcohol users and dichotomized acutely intoxicated patients using three different BAL-level thresholds. Primary outcomes included in-hospital complications, along with prolonged ventilation and intensive care unit length of stay, both defined as the top decile. Secondary outcomes included rates of drug or alcohol withdrawal and all-cause mortality. Analyses were adjusted for clinical factors. RESULTS We studied 715 patients (77.5% men, 60.6% ≤ 40 y of age, median Injury Severity Score: 14, 41.7% motor vehicle crashes, 17.9% gunshot wounds, 11.1% falls). While 31.0% were CDT+, 48.7% were BAL>0. After adjusting for CDT levels, BAL levels >0, >100, or >200 were not associated with adverse outcomes. However, CDT+ relative to patients with CDT were associated with complications (adjusted odds ratio: 1.96 [1.24-3.09]), prolonged ventilation days (3.23 [1.08-9.65]), and prolonged intensive care unit stays (2.83 [1.20-6.68]). CONCLUSIONS In this 2-year prospective, cross-sectional, and observational study, we found that %dCDT levels, relative to BAL levels, may better stratify admitted patients with traumatic injury into acute versus chronic alcohol users, identifying those at higher risk for in-hospital complications.","Sakran, Joseph V; Mehta, Ambar; Matar, Maher M; Wilson, Dulaney A; Kent, Alistair J; Anton, Raymond F; Fakhry, Samir M",The Journal of surgical research,612,16

It remains unclear to what extent the treatment-related reduction in follow-up infarct volume (FIV) explains the improved functional outcome after EVT in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Objective To study whether FIV mediates the relationship between EVT and functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Design, Setting, and Participants Patient data from 7 randomized multicenter trials were pooled. These trials were conducted between December 2010 and April 2015 and included 1764 patients randomly assigned to receive either EVT or standard care (control). Follow-up infarct volume was assessed on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging after stroke onset. Mediation analysis was performed to examine the potential causal chain in which FIV may mediate the relationship between EVT and functional outcome. A total of 1690 patients met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-five additional patients were excluded, resulting in a total of 1665 patients, including 821 (49.3%) in the EVT group and 844 (50.7%) in the control group. Data were analyzed from January to June 2017. Main Outcome and Measure The 90-day functional outcome via the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Results Among 1665 patients, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 68 (57-76) years, and 781 (46.9%) were female. The median (IQR) time to FIV measurement was 30 (24-237) hours. The median (IQR) FIV was 41 (14-120) mL. Patients in the EVT group had significantly smaller FIVs compared with patients in the control group (median [IQR] FIV, 33 [11-99] vs 51 [18-134] mL; P = .007) and lower mRS scores at 90 days (median [IQR] score, 3 [1-4] vs 4 [2-5]). Follow-up infarct volume was a predictor of functional outcome (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.39-0.54; P < .001). Follow-up infarct volume partially mediated the relationship between treatment type with mRS score, as EVT was still significantly associated with functional outcome after adjustment for FIV (adjusted common odds ratio, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.52-3.21; P < .001). Treatment-reduced FIV explained 12% (95% CI, 1-19) of the relationship between EVT and functional outcome. Conclusions and Relevance In this analysis, follow-up infarct volume predicted functional outcome; however, a reduced infarct volume after treatment with EVT only explained 12% of the treatment benefit. Follow-up infarct volume as measured on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging is not a valid proxy for estimating treatment effect in phase II and III trials of acute ischemic stroke.","Boers, Anna M M; Jansen, Ivo G H; Brown, Scott; Lingsma, Hester F; Beenen, Ludo F M; Devlin, Thomas G; Román, Luis San; Heo, Ji-Hoe; Ribó, Marc; Almekhlafi, Mohammed A; Liebeskind, David S; Teitelbaum, Jeanne; Cuadras, Patricia; du Mesnil de Rochemont, Richard; Beaumont, Marine; Brown, Martin M; Yoo, Albert J; Donnan, Geoffrey A; Mas, Jean Louis; Oppenheim, Catherine; Dowling, Richard J; Moulin, Thierry; Agrinier, Nelly; Lopes, Demetrius K; Aja Rodríguez, Lucía; Compagne, Kars C J; Al-Ajlan, Fahad S; Madigan, Jeremy; Albers, Gregory W; Soize, Sebastien; Blasco, Jordi; Davis, Stephen M; Nogueira, Raul G; Dávalos, Antoni; Menon, Bijoy K; van der Lugt, Aad; Muir, Keith W; Roos, Yvo B W E M; White, Phil; Mitchell, Peter J; Demchuk, Andrew M; van Zwam, Wim H; Jovin, Tudor G; van Oostenbrugge, Robert J; Dippel, Diederik W J; Campbell, Bruce C V; Guillemin, Francis; Bracard, Serge; Hill, Michael D; Goyal, Mayank; Marquering, Henk A; Majoie, Charles B L M",JAMA neurology,612,20

En una cámara con diversos flujos de aire se exhalaron aerosoles radiomarcados desde una cabeza de maniquí de cara blanda ventilada, utilizando respiración periódica y tos (Fuente). En otro maniquí, al que se le colocó un filtro, se cuantificó la exposición del Receptor. Se probaron una mascarilla quirúrgica de ajuste natural, una mascarilla quirúrgica de ajuste seguro (SecureFit) y una mascarilla respiratoria autofiltrante de clase N95 (comúnmente conocida como ""mascarilla autofiltrante N95"") con y sin sello de vaselina. Con la tos, el control de la fuente (mascarilla quirúrgica/autofiltrante colocada en la Fuente) fue estadísticamente superior a la protección brindada por la mascarilla quirúrgica/mascarilla autofiltrante sin sellar en el Receptor (protección del Receptor) en todos los entornos. Para igualar el control de la fuente durante la tos, la mascarilla autofiltrante N95 debe estar sellada con vaselina.

This meta-analysis aimed at synthesizing the available evidence on the efficacy of HFNC on exercise capacity, lung function, and other factors related to pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD patients. Methods Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science) were searched for randomized trials comparing with conventional oxygen therapy (COT) or noninvasive ventilation (NIV). Primary outcomes were respiratory rate, FEV1, tidal volume, oxygen partial pressure, total score of St. George's respiratory questionnaire, 6-minute walk test, and exercise endurance time. Results Ten trials met the criteria for inclusion. Combined data from six studies showed that HFNC showed a lower respiratory rate in COPD patients [mean difference -1.27 (95% CI: -1.65-(-0.89)]. Combined data from three studies showed a lower forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) in the group of HFNC. No difference in tidal volume was showed between the HFNC and control groups in COPD patients. No significant oxygen improvement between the HFNC groups and control groups. The total score of St. George's respiratory questionnaire was improved by the subgroup analysis of HFNC versus COT but no NIV. Two multicenter RCTs showed the six-minute walk test, and statistical results showed that the length of the six-minute walk capacity was increased after usage of HFNC compared to the control group [mean difference -8.65 (95% CI: -9.12-(-8.19)]. No increase of exercise capacity after usage of HFNC (mean difference -12.65). Conclusion In the first meta-analysis of the area, the current evidence did not show so much positive effect on tidal volume or oxygen improvement in COPD patients. Length of the six-minute walk capacity was increased after using HFNC, while other pulmonary rehabilitation parameters, namely, the score of St. George's respiratory questionnaire and exercise capacity show no increase in the group of HFNC. The variance in the quality of the evidence included in this meta-analysis highlights the need for this evidence to be followed up with further high-quality and more randomized trials.","Fu, Cuiping; Liu, Xin; Zhu, Qingqing; Wu, Xu; Hao, Shengyu; Xie, Liang; Li, Shanqun",BioMed research international,612,1

Partial stomach-partitioning gastrojejunostomy (PSPGJ) has been introduced as an alternative surgical treatment of GOO to reduce the risk of postoperative delayed gastric emptying (DGE). AIM The aim was to study PSPGJ as an alternative to CGJ in the treatment of GOO, with respect to DGE. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective cohort study was completed in all patients who underwent a bypass of the duodenum via PSPGJ or CGJ due to GOO. Cases where concomitant biliary or bariatric procedures were performed were excluded. RESULTS Twenty-four patients met the inclusion criteria for the study; ten cases underwent PSPGJ and 14 CGJ. The incidence of DGE grade B-C was significantly lower in the PSPGJ group (0 %) compared with the CGJ group (42.9 %, p = 0.024). Oral nutrition only was recorded more often at follow-up in the PSPGJ group (9/9, 100 %) than in the CGJ group (4/13, 30.8 %) (p = 0.002).

METHODS A 2-week survival study evaluating transanal endoscopic rectosigmoid resection with stapled colorectal anastomosis was conducted with swine using the transanal approach alone (TEM group, n = 10) or a transanal approach combined with transgastric endoscopic assistance (TEM + TG group, n = 10). Gastrotomies were created using a needleknife and balloon dilation, then closed using prototype T-tags. Outcomes were evaluated and compared between the groups using Student's t-test and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS Relative to the TEM group, the average length of rectosigmoid mobilized in the TEM + TG group was 15.6 versus 10.5 cm (p < 0.0005), the length of the resected specimen was 9 versus 6.2 cm (p < 0.0005), and the mean operative time was 254.5 versus 97.5 min (p < 0.0005). Intraoperatively, no organ injury or major bleeding was noted. Two T-tag misfires occurred during gastrotomy closure and four small staple line defects requiring transanal repair including one in the TEM group and three in the TEM + TG group (p = 0.2). Postoperatively, there was no mortality, and the animals gained an average of 3.4 lb. Two major complications (10%) were identified at necropsy in the TEM + TG group including an intraabdominal abscess and an abdominal wall hematoma related to T-tag misfire. Gastrotomy closure sites and colorectal anastomoses were all grossly healed, with adhesions noted in 60 and 70% and microabscesses in 50 and 20% of the gastrotomy sites and colorectal anastomoses, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) for rectosigmoid resection using TEM with or without transgastric endoscopic assistance is feasible and associated with low morbidity in a porcine survival model. Transgastric assistance significantly prolongs the operative time but extends the length of the rectosigmoid mobilized transanally, with a nonsignificant increase in complication rates related to gastrotomy creation.","Sylla, Patricia; Sohn, Dae Kyung; Cizginer, Sevdenur; Konuk, Yusuf; Turner, Brian G; Gee, Denise W; Willingham, Field F; Hsu, Maylee; Mino-Kenudson, Mari; Brugge, William R; Rattner, David W",Surgical endoscopy,612,15

Neurodevelopment is a multifactorial outcome that can be assessed by various assessors, using different measures. This has given rise to a debate on the validity of various measures of neurodevelopment. The aim of this review was twofold. Firstly we aimed to give an overview of studies on child neurodevelopment after prenatal exposure to central nervous system acting medications using psychotropics and analgesics as examples, giving special focus on the use and validity of outcome measures. Secondly, we aimed to give guidance on how to conduct and interpret medication safety studies with neurodevelopment outcomes. We conducted a systematic review in the MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane databases from inception to April 2019, including controlled studies on prenatal exposure to psychotropics or analgesics and child neurodevelopment, measured with standardised psychometric instruments or by diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorder. The review management tool Covidence was used for data-extraction. Outcomes were grouped as motor skills, cognition, behaviour, emotionality, or ""other"". We identified 110 eligible papers (psychotropics, 82 papers, analgesics, 29 papers). A variety of neurodevelopmental outcome measures were used, including 27 different psychometric instruments administered by health care professionals, 15 different instruments completed by parents, and 13 different diagnostic categories. In 23 papers, no comments were made on the validity of the outcome measure. In conclusion, establishing neurodevelopmental safety includes assessing a wide variety of outcomes important for the child's daily functioning including motor skills, cognition, behaviour, and emotionality, with valid and reliable measures from infancy through to adolescence. Consensus is needed in the scientific community on how neurodevelopment should be assessed in medication safety in pregnancy studies.

METHODS This study used data collected via Youper, a mental health app, from February through July 2020. Youper users (N = 157,213) in the United States self-reported positive and negative emotions and anxiety and depression symptoms during the pandemic. We examined emotions and symptoms before (pre), during (acute), and after (sustained) COVID-related stay-at-home orders. RESULTS For changes in frequency of reported acute emotions, from the pre to acute periods, anxiety increased while tiredness, calmness, happiness, and optimism decreased. From the acute to sustained periods, sadness, depression, and gratitude increased. Anxiety, stress, and tiredness decreased. Between the pre and sustained periods, sadness and depression increased, as did happiness and calmness. Anxiety and stress decreased. Among symptom measures, anxiety increased initially, from the pre to the acute periods, but later returned to baseline. LIMITATIONS The study sample was primarily comprised of young people and women. The app does not collect racial or ethnicity data. These factors may limit generalizability. Sample size was also not consistent for all data collected. CONCLUSIONS The present study suggests that although there were initial negative impacts on emotions and mental health symptoms in the first few weeks, many Americans demonstrated resilience over the following months. The impact of the pandemic on mental health may not be as severe as predicted, although future work is necessary to understand longitudinal effects as the pandemic continues.","Yarrington, Julia S; Lasser, Jana; Garcia, David; Vargas, Jose Hamilton; Couto, Diego Dotta; Marafon, Thiago; Craske, Michelle G; Niles, Andrea N",Journal of affective disorders,612,29

MATERIALS AND METHODS The HemoSplit TCC with BioBloc (silver sulfadiazine) coating (n = 100, control group) and the Tal Palindrome Ruby TCC, which has a novel silver antimicrobial sleeve and a spiral-z tip design (n = 100, study group), were compared in this case-controlled study. The main endpoints were TCC infection and malfunction. RESULTS Primary-assisted TCC patency was significantly reduced with the BioBloc TCC (71% and 61% at 90 and 180 days, respectively) compared with the Palindrome Ruby TCC (94% at 90 and 180 days, P < .0001). Multivariate analysis identified only the BioBloc TCC and common femoral access site as independent predictors of worse patency. The unadjusted relative risk (95% confidence interval) for TCC dysfunction with the BioBloc compared with the Palindrome Ruby was 6.0 (2.33-15.53, P < .001), and the relative risk adjusted for access site was 3.2 (1.71-11.96, P = .002). The infection-free rates of the two TCC types were similar (P = .36). The reintervention-free rate for infection or malfunction was significantly better with the Palindrome Ruby TCC (76% and 58% at 90 and 180 days, respectively) than with the BioBloc TCC (60% and 45% at 90 and 180 days, respectively; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS The results support the use of the Palindrome Ruby TCC on the basis of the significantly lower thrombosis and reintervention rate; randomized trials are justified to confirm this finding and to evaluate its role in the prevention of TCC infection.","Kakkos, Stavros K; Haddad, Georges K; Haddad, Roger K; Scully, Martha M",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,612,30

This involves a call handler or clinician using a digital triage tool to generate algorithm-based care advice, based on a patient's symptoms. Advice typically takes the form of signposting within defined levels of urgency to specific services or self-care advice. Despite wide adoption, there is limited evaluation of its impact on service user experience, service use and clinical outcomes; no previous systematic reviews have focussed on services that utilise digital triage, and its impact on these outcome areas within urgent care. This review aims to address this need, particularly now that telephone-based digital triage is well established in healthcare delivery. METHODS Studies assessing the impact of telephone-based digital triage on service user experience, health care service use and clinical outcomes will be identified through searches conducted in Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Science and Scopus. Search terms using words relating to digital triage and urgent care settings (excluding in-hours general practice) will be used. The review will include all original study types including qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods studies; studies published in the last 20 years and studies published in English. Quality assessment of studies will be conducted using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT); a narrative synthesis approach will be used to analyse and summarise findings. DISCUSSION This is the first systematic review to evaluate service user experience, service use and clinical outcomes related to the use of telephone-based digital triage in urgent care settings. It will evaluate evidence from studies of wide-ranging designs. The narrative synthesis approach will enable the integration of findings to provide new insights on service delivery. Models of urgent care continue to evolve rapidly, with the emergence of self-triage tools and national help lines. Findings from this review will be presented in a practical format that can feed into the design of digital triage tools, future service design and healthcare policy.

Urotherapy is recommended in LUTD treatment management. In our country, all citizens under the age of 20 were banned from going out of their homes due to Covid-19 and the homeschooling system has been adopted The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of lockdown and homeschooling on the effectiveness of urotherapy used for LUTD treatment. METHODS 83 patients were included in the study group. Besides 306 patients were determined as the control group (pre-Covid). The patients in the study group and the control group were compared in terms of improvement in Dysfunctional voiding and incontinence scoring system (DVISS), quality of life scores, bladder diary, Bristol stool scale, and treatment responses at 3rd and 6th months. RESULTS The study group and control group were compared in terms of DVISS, voiding frequency and incontinence in the voiding diary, quality of life score, and Bristol stool scale at admission visit and the group characteristics were similar. During the 6th month visit, the mean DVISS of the study group was found to be significantly lower (7.12 ± 3.48; 8.58 ± 4.06 respectively (p 0.002)). Daily voiding frequency was similar in the study group and the control group during the 2nd and 3rd visit. The study group's mean number of daily incontinence was significantly lower at visit 3 (0.57 ± 0.9; 0.94 ± 0.27, respectively (p 0.02).After six months of treatment, 13.3% of the study group patients had a complete response, 44.6% had a partial response, whereas 42.2% non-responders. In the control group, the response rates were as 5.9%, 39.2% and 54.9% respectively (p 0.02). CONCLUSIONS LUTD is still very common in pediatric urology. Standard urotherapy is widely used in treatment management. According to our results, the success of standard urotherapy increases with lockdown and homeschooling. We have shown that the success of standard urotherapy can be improved by regulating environmental conditions. In terms of LUTD management, environmental conditions can be regulated to provide a better quality of life and a better cure in a more economical way.","Akinci, Aykut; Baklaci, Can Utku; Oğuz, Efe Semetey; Kubilay, Eralp; Sanci, Adem; Aydoğ, Ezel; Hajiyev, Perviz; Soygür, Tarkan; Burgu, Berk",Journal of pediatric urology,612,1

Second, we show that the distribution of population outflow from Wuhan accurately predicts the relative frequency and geographic distribution of COVID-19 infections through February 19, 2020, across all of China. Third, we develop a spatio-temporal ""risk source"" model that leverages population flow data (which operationalizes risk emanating from epidemic epicenters) to not only forecast confirmed cases, but also to identify high-transmission-risk locales at an early stage. Fourth, we use this risk source model to statistically derive the geographic spread of COVID-19 and the growth pattern based on the population outflow from Wuhan; the model yields a benchmark trend and an index for assessing COVID-19 community transmission risk over time for different locations.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA The use of lightweight meshes in laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair could have beneficial effects on quality of life and preservation of the spermatic structures due to a decreased foreign-body reaction. METHODS A total of 59 male patients planned for primary, unilateral or bilateral inguinal hernia repair were randomized between a standard polypropylene (Marlex) or lightweight mesh (Vypro II, TiMesh). Main outcome measures were fertility aspects, assessed preoperatively and at 1-year follow-up by semen analysis and scrotal ultrasonography. Secondary outcomes were quality of life (SF-36 and McGill Pain Questionnaire) and recurrence up to 1 year postoperatively. RESULTS Patients operated on with a VyproII or TiMesh mesh exhibited a decreased sperm motility (vs. preoperatively) compared with Marlex patients, respectively -9.5% and -5.5% versus +2% (P = 0.013). When the results after uni- and bilateral hernia repair were analyzed separately, this difference only remained significant in the bilateral hernia subgroup: -10% for VyproII and -17% for TiMesh versus +1% for Marlex (P = 0.037). Other fertility parameters (sperm concentration, morphology, and alpha-glucosidase level) were unchanged. There were no differences at any study point between the 3 groups regarding quality of life. Only for resumption of sport activities was a small advantage noted for VyproII versus Marlex patients (P = 0.045). After 1 year, no recurrences were observed; 3 patients (6%) complained of chronic disabling pain. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that the use of lightweight meshes for laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair in male patients negatively influences sperm motility, without any benefit on quality of life. These alterations might be important in a subgroup of young male patients operated on laparoscopically for a bilateral hernia. This study was registered in the clinicaltrials.gov database (ID number NCT00925067).","Peeters, Ellen; Spiessens, Carl; Oyen, Raymond; De Wever, Liesbeth; Vanderschueren, Dirk; Penninckx, Freddy; Miserez, Marc",Annals of surgery,612,27

Given the crucial role of EF in learning and school adjustment, it is important to document the factors that bolster the development of executive competence, especially during a period of growth. Although substantial evidence suggests that parent-child relationships relate to EF, few longitudinal studies have examined the parental antecedents of EF developmental trajectories during the school years. Accordingly, this multiyear longitudinal study (N = 102) explored the respective roles of early mother-child attachment security and maternal autonomy support in the prediction of patterns of growth in working memory, cognitive flexibility, and planning skills across Grades 2 to 4. Multilevel growth curve analyses revealed a unique positive relation between attachment security and all EF skills, whereas autonomy support was mainly independently associated with initial planning performance. These findings provide further suggestion for a global contribution of secure attachment relationships to children's executive competence and highlight the importance of supporting children's autonomy to foster the emergence of more complex EF abilities such as planning. This study also supports the relevance of considering multiple aspects of parent-child relationships to delineate how early caregiving experiences contribute to children's EF development.","Regueiro, Sophie; Matte-Gagné, Célia; Bernier, Annie",Journal of experimental child psychology,612,19

METHODS To estimate adjustment factors, children were classified as: (i) reference (malaria negative without inflammation), (ii) inflammation without malaria (I), (iii) malaria without inflammation (M) and (iv) inflammation with malaria (IM). We estimated the unadjusted ID or IDA prevalence, and then adjusted for inflammation alone (IDI or IDAI ) or inflammation and malaria (IDIM or IDAIM ). RESULTS Mean ferritin was 38 (reference), 45 (I), 43 (M) and 54 μg/l (IM) in LowM, increasing to 44, 56, 96 and 167 μg/l, respectively, in HighM. Corresponding mean sTfR was 6.4, 6.9, 7.9 and 8.4 mg/l in LowM, increasing to 8.2, 9.2. 8.7 and 9.7 mg/l in HighM. Ferritin-based ID, IDI and IDIM were 7.8%, 8.7% or 9.1%, respectively, in LowM and 4.6%, 10.0% or 11.7%, respectively, in HighM. Corresponding soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR)-based estimates were 27.0%, 24.1% and 19.1%, respectively, in LowM, increasing to 53.6%, 46.5% and 45.3%, respectively, in HighM. Additional adjustment for malaria resulted in a ~1- to 2-percentage point change in IDA, depending on biomarker and season. CONCLUSIONS In this population, malaria substantially increased ferritin and sTfR concentrations, with modest effects on ID and IDA prevalence estimates.","Barffour, Maxwell A; Schulze, Kerry J; Coles, Christian L; Chileshe, Justin; Kalungwana, Ng'andwe; Siamusantu, Ward; Arguello, Margia; Moss, William J; West, Keith P; Palmer, Amanda C",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,612,5

DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, APA PsycINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, Google Scholar, Google, ProQuest Theses and Dissertations Database, APA PsycExtra and Opengrey.eu were searched in May 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Studies were included if they investigated the effects of viewing at least one visual artwork on at least one stress outcome measure. Studies involving active engagement with art, review papers or qualitative studies were excluded. There were no limits in terms of year of publication, contexts or population types; however, only studies published in the English language were considered. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Information extracted from manuscripts included: study methodologies, population and setting characteristics, details of the artwork interventions and key findings. RESULTS 14 primary studies were identified, with heterogeneous study designs, methodologies and artwork interventions.

This definition provides a perspective that is complementary to the well-understood detrimental effects of physical inactivity. Sitting occupies the majority of the daily waking hours in most adults and has become even more pervasive owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. The potential for a broad cardiovascular health benefit exists through an integrated approach that involves 'sitting less and moving more'. In this Review, we first consider observational and experimental evidence on the adverse effects of prolonged, uninterrupted sitting and the evidence identifying the possible mechanisms underlying the associated risk. We summarize the results of randomized controlled trials demonstrating the feasibility of changing sedentary behaviour. We also highlight evidence on the deleterious synergies between sedentary behaviour and physical inactivity as the underpinnings of our case for addressing them jointly in mitigating cardiovascular risk. This integrated approach should not only reduce the specific risks of too much sitting but also have a positive effect on the total amount of physical activity, with the potential to more broadly benefit the health of individuals living with or at risk of developing cardiovascular disease.","Dunstan, David W; Dogra, Shilpa; Carter, Sophie E; Owen, Neville",Nature reviews.

METHODS Data are from the Keimyung Stroke Registry. Consecutive patients with M1 segment middle cerebral artery ± intracranial internal carotid artery occlusions on baseline computed tomographic angiography (CTA) from May 2004 to July 2009 were included. Baseline and follow-up imaging was analyzed blinded to all clinical information. Two raters assessed leptomeningeal collaterals on baseline CTA by consensus, using a previously validated regional leptomeningeal score (rLMC). RESULTS Baseline characteristics (N = 206) were: mean age = 66.9 ± 11.6 years, median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale = 14 (interquartile range [IQR] = 11-20), and median time from stroke symptom onset to CTA = 166 minutes (IQR = 96-262). Poor collateral status at baseline (rLMC score = 0-10) was seen in 73 of 206 patients (35.4%). On univariate analyses, patients with poor collateral status at baseline were older; were hypertensive; had higher white blood cell count, blood glucose, D-dimer, and serum uric acid levels; and were more likely to have metabolic syndrome. Multivariate modeling identified metabolic syndrome (odds ratio [OR] = 3.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.69-6.15, p < 0.001), hyperuricemia (per 1mg/dl serum uric acid; OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.12-1.62, p < 0.01), and older age (per 10 years; OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.02-1.77, p = 0.03) as independent predictors of poor leptomeningeal collateral status at baseline.

The combination of rapid separating technique and multiple individual microneedle arrays provides the combined ability to efficiently deliver insulin into the skin within seconds and to independently control insulin release kinetics. In addition, the diabetic rats with a traditional breakfast-lunch-dinner lifestyle exhibit obvious intraday glucose fluctuations, while the hypoglycemic experiments indicate that the IMP is capable of simultaneous bolus and sustained insulin delivery to closely match the glucose rise that occurs in response to meals and efficiently minimize excessive fluctuations, suggesting the potential of this new transdermal insulin delivery system as substitutes for multiple daily injections.","Chen, Bo Zhi; Zhang, Li Qin; Xia, Yi Yun; Zhang, Xiao Peng; Guo, Xin Dong",Science advances,612,1

Τhese reports hit the mass media headlines and were also included in the debate among political parties. The literature suggests that during periods of deep economic crisis, there is an increase specifically in suicides but causality remains unclear. The prevailing picture both in the scientific literature and in the mass media is that the economic crisis acts as a more or less generic risk factor on the entire population putting at risk literally anybody. Two recent studies clearly dispute it by reporting that suicides had increased several months before unemployment increased. Additionally and specifically concerning Greece, where the economic crisis is deeper and more prolonged, the detailed inspection of age and gender specific rates are not in accord with a ""male gender"" by ""unemployment"" interaction. Taking into consideration the above and since the rise in suicides also affects prospering countries without high unemployment, including Germany and Norway, another possible explanation is that the changes in the socioeconomic environment and especially in the employment conditions have overstressed vulnerable populations (e.g. mental patients) leading to the increased suicide rates. The problem is that in the majority of the literature the economic crisis/austerity is considered to be a generic risk factor affecting the entire population and subsequently generic horizontal measures are proposed. Unfortunately patients at risk to commit suicide are not considered as such; instead they are rather considered as normal healthy people from the general population who respond with suicide to generic adverse events.","Fountoulakis, K N",Psychiatrike = Psychiatriki,612,27

Three alterations of the built environment are examined: handwashing stations (HW), relative humidity control (RH), and negatively pressured treatment rooms (NP). These interventions were evaluated to minimize total cost of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), including medical and litigation costs. BACKGROUND HAIs are largely preventable but are difficult to control because of their multiple mechanisms of transmission. Moreover, the costs of HAIs and resulting mortality are increasing with the latest estimates at US$9.8 billion annually. METHOD Using 6 years of longitudinal multidrug-resistant infection data, we simulated the transmission of pathogenic bacteria and the infection control efforts of the three alterations using Chamchod and Ruan's model. We determined the optimal budget allocations among the alterations by representing them under Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions for this nonlinear optimization problem. RESULTS We examined 24 scenarios using three virulence levels across three facility sizes with varying budget levels. We found that in general, most of the budget is allocated to the NP or RH alterations in each intervention. At lower budgets, however, it was necessary to use the lower cost alterations, HW or RH. CONCLUSIONS Mathematical optimization offers healthcare enterprise executives and engineers a tool to assist with the design of safer healthcare facilities within a fiscally constrained environment. Herein, models were developed for the optimal allocation of funds between HW, RH, and negatively pressured treatment rooms (NP) to best reduce HAIs. Specific strategies vary by facility size and virulence.","Squire, Marietta M; Igusa, Takeru; Siddiqui, Sauleh; Sessel, Gareth K; Squire, Edward N",HERD,612,24

Innovative solutions like video telehealth may increase the reach of extant clinicians; however, little is known about perceived barriers and facilitators to in-home video telehealth for dementia management from the perspectives of caregivers.Methods: Twenty-four caregivers of community-dwelling Veterans with dementia participated in semi-structured interviews. Questions gathered perceived facilitators and barriers to in-home video telehealth for dementia management through experience with related technology. Transcripts were analyzed using directed content analysis which was guided by factors previously identified as influencing older adults' adoption of technology.Results: Caregiver experience with related technology was mostly facilitative to video telehealth, which was thought best suited for follow-up care. Increased access and decreased patient-caregiver stress were potential benefits. Barriers included perceived limitations of video and the belief that persons with dementia would have limited ability to manage technological aspects and to engage in video telehealth on their own.Conclusions: This study improves our understanding of the factors that caregivers perceive as barriers and facilitators to in-home video telehealth for dementia management.Clinical Implications: Strategies to optimize video telehealth include capitalizing on caregivers' social network and providing targeted training.","Gately, Megan E; Tickle-Degnen, Linda; McLaren, Jaye E; Ward, Nathan; Ladin, Keren; Moo, Lauren R",Clinical gerontologist,612,1

Sepsis is a syndrome of systemic manifestations induced by infection of any organisms; including bacterial, fungal and viral agents. Here, we investigated the diagnosis, management and outcomes of dengue patients presenting with sepsis in a prospective study of community-acquired sepsis in Thailand. METHODS From June to December 2015, 874 adult patients (age≥18 years) with suspected or documented community-acquired infection, with ≥3 diagnostic criteria for sepsis according to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2012, and within 24 hours of admission were evaluated. Serum was stored and later tested for dengue PCR assays. RESULTS A total of 126 patients had dengue PCR assays positive (2 DENV-1, 12 DENV-2, 24 DENV-3 and 88 DENV-4), and 5 of them (4%) died. We found that attending physicians suspected dengue infection on admission in 84 patients (67%), and recorded dengue infection as the final diagnosis in 96 patients (76%). Four of five fatal cases were diagnosed and treated as septic shock not due to dengue. In multivariable analysis, there was a trend showing that age≥60 years, hypoxemia and misdiagnosis of dengue by attending physicians were associated with 28-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS A number of adult patients who died of dengue are misdiagnosed as severe sepsis and septic shock. Diagnosis of dengue based on clinical features alone is difficult. Rapid diagnostic tests for dengue may need to be routinely used in adult patients presenting with sepsis and septic shock in tropical countries. This approach could improve diagnosis and management of those patients.","Teparrukkul, Prapit; Hantrakun, Viriya; Day, Nicholas P J; West, T Eoin; Limmathurotsakul, Direk",PloS one,612,24

The ICPs used in this work were comprised of two components, i.e. a supramolecular Ln-ICP host formed by the coordination between the GMP ligand and central metal ion Tb3+, and guest GQDs with abundant functional groups, which were utilized as antenna ligands to further sensitize the fluorescence of Tb/GMP. Upon excitation at 300 nm, the obtained GQD@Tb/GMP ICP nanoparticles exhibited enhanced green fluorescence from Tb/GMP. With the addition of Cu2+, the competitive coordination between Cu2+ and GQDs weakened the antenna effect, leading to a decrease in the fluorescence of GQD@Tb/GMP ICPs. However, in the presence of thiocholine (TCh), a thiol-containing compound hydrolyzed from acetylthiocholine (ATCh) by AChE, a stronger coordination interaction between Cu2+ and TCh occurred, resulting in the restoration of the fluorescence of GQD@Tb/GMP ICPs. Using the method established herein, the cerebrospinal AChE fluctuation of rats with acute organophosphorus pesticide (OP) poisoning or chronic Alzheimer's disease (AD) could be monitored. This study essentially provides a novel approach to realize the direct monitoring of a biomarker for brain dysfunction by regulating the competitive coordination interaction reversibly, which is critical in the early diagnosis and therapy of brain diseases.","Liu, Chang; Huang, Chunyu; Ma, Ruixue; Zhai, Wanying; Deng, Jingjing; Zhou, Tianshu",The Analyst,612,26

Uncertainty remains as to the magnitude of this effect and to how this association changes with time and degree of healing. METHODS PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science searches identified 1570 citations. Screening of abstracts identified 155 articles for full-text review, of which 19 met inclusion criteria. For 3 outcomes of interest (surgeries, hospitalizations, remission), weighted random-effects meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS In pooled analysis, MH predicted fewer major abdominal surgeries (relative risk [RR], 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26-0.46), increased remission (RR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.43-2.36), and fewer hospitalizations (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.42-0.78). Complete MH and partial MH both showed significantly higher rates of favorable outcomes. Separate analyses for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis showed identical patterns for surgeries and remission. When subjects with no healing were excluded, and complete versus partial healing was compared, rates of surgery were not significantly different (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.46-1.44). However, complete healing was superior in predicting corticosteroid-free remission (RR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.24-2.34). Meta-regression found that the predictive power of this complete versus partial healing distinction was strongly associated with the duration of follow-up after endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS MH is a strong predictor of fewer surgeries, long-term clinical remission, and fewer hospitalizations. Complete healing is not significantly more favorable than partial healing for predicting surgeries or hospitalizations, but it did predict higher rates of clinical remission. This benefit of complete MH over partial healing increases with follow-up time.","Reinink, Andrew R; Lee, Terrence C; Higgins, Peter D R",Inflammatory bowel diseases,612,11

Fourteen patients with severe acquired brain injury and orthostatic intolerance and fifteen healthy volunteers were enrolled. Blood pressure was evaluated by pulse contour analysis, heart rate and RR-intervals were determined by electrocardiography, middle cerebral artery velocity was evaluated by transcranial Doppler, and near-infrared spectroscopy determined frontal lobe oxygenation in the supine position and during head-up tilt. Cerebral autoregulation was evaluated as the mean flow index calculated as the ratio between middle cerebral artery mean velocity and estimated cerebral perfusion pressure. Patients with acquired brain injury presented an increase in mean flow index during head-up tilt indicating impaired autoregulation (P < 0.001). Spectral analysis of heart rate variability in the frequency domain revealed lower magnitudes of ~0.1 Hz spectral power in patients compared to healthy controls suggesting baroreflex dysfunction. In conclusion, patients with severe acquired brain injury and orthostatic intolerance during head-up tilt have impaired cerebral autoregulation more than one month after brain injury.","Riberholt, Christian Gunge; Olesen, Niels Damkjær; Thing, Mira; Juhl, Carsten Bogh; Mehlsen, Jesper; Petersen, Tue Hvass",PloS one,612,23

However, providing intravenous therapy is complex and errors are common. 'Smart pumps' incorporating dose error reduction software have been widely advocated to reduce error. However, little is known about their effect on patient safety, how they are used or their likely impact. This study will explore the landscape of intravenous medication infusion practices and errors in English hospitals and how smart pumps may relate to the prevalence of medication administration errors. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This is a mixed-methods study involving an observational quantitative point prevalence study to determine the frequency and types of errors that occur in the infusion of intravenous medication, and qualitative interviews with hospital staff to better understand infusion practices and the contexts in which errors occur. The study will involve 5 clinical areas (critical care, general medicine, general surgery, paediatrics and oncology), across 14 purposively sampled acute hospitals and 2 paediatric hospitals to cover a range of intravenous infusion practices. Data collectors will compare each infusion running at the time of data collection against the patient's medication orders to identify any discrepancies. The potential clinical importance of errors will be assessed. Quantitative data will be analysed descriptively; interviews will be analysed using thematic analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval has been obtained from an NHS Research Ethics Committee (14/SC/0290); local approvals will be sought from each participating organisation. Findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences for academic and health professional audiences. Results will also be fed back to participating organisations to inform local policy, training and procurement. Aggregated findings will inform the debate on costs and benefits of the NHS investing in smart pump technology, and what other changes may need to be made to ensure effectiveness of such an investment.","Blandford, Ann; Furniss, Dominic; Lyons, Imogen; Chumbley, Gill; Iacovides, Ioanna; Wei, Li; Cox, Anna; Mayer, Astrid; Schnock, Kumiko; Bates, David Westfall; Dykes, Patricia C; Bell, Helen; Franklin, Bryony Dean",BMJ open,612,11

However, its use after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is controversial. We retrospectively assessed the usefulness of SNB after NAC by comparing axillary recurrence rates and other parameters in patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer who underwent SNB after NAC or without NAC. PATIENTS AND METHODS At our hospital, 1179 patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer underwent SNB from April 2007 to December 2013. The clinicopathological and survival data of patients who underwent SNB after NAC (the NAC group) and those who underwent SNB without NAC (the control group) were compared. Patients with a metastatic sentinel node underwent axillary lymph node dissection. RESULTS The number of patients in the NAC and control groups was 183 (15.5%) and 996 (84.5%), respectively. At diagnosis, tumors were significantly larger in the NAC group (P < .0001). Sentinel nodes were identified in almost all patients in both groups (99.5% in the NAC group vs. 99.8% in the control group). They were nonmetastatic in 147 (80.8%) patients in the NAC group and 849 (85.5%) patients in the control group.

Simulation-based training could help trainees overcome the first part of the learning curve, but no virtual-reality simulators for thoracoscopy are commercially available. This study aimed to investigate whether training on a laparoscopic simulator enables trainees to perform a thoracoscopic lobectomy. METHODS Twenty-eight surgical residents were randomized to either virtual-reality training on a nephrectomy module or traditional black-box simulator training. After a retention period they performed a thoracoscopic lobectomy on a porcine model and their performance was scored using a previously validated assessment tool. RESULTS The groups did not differ in age or gender. All participants were able to complete the lobectomy. The performance of the black-box group was significantly faster during the test scenario than the virtual-reality group: 26.6 min (SD 6.7 min) versus 32.7 min (SD 7.5 min). No difference existed between the two groups when comparing bleeding and anatomical and non-anatomical errors. CONCLUSION Simulation-based training and targeted instructions enabled the trainees to perform a simulated thoracoscopic lobectomy.

Through periodic assessment of saturation trends on infants' bedside histogram reports, our initiative aimed to (1) increase time spent at goal saturations and (2) reduce death or severe retinopathy of prematurity. STUDY DESIGN The initiative integrated histogram monitoring into provider, respiratory, and nursing care. Achieved oxygen saturations, chart audits, and bedside histogram monitoring flowsheets provided process measures with the outcome measure of death or severe retinopathy of prematurity. RESULTS In infants <29 weeks' gestation (n = 518), the rate of death or severe retinopathy of prematurity prior to hospital discharge decreased from 32.1% to 18.0%. Time at goal saturations (90-95%) increased from 48.7% to 57.6%. CONCLUSION In infants born at <29 weeks' gestation, periodic, multidisciplinary oxygen saturation histogram monitoring improved time at goal saturations and was associated with a reduction in death or severe retinopathy of prematurity.","Gentle, Samuel; El-Ferzli, George; Winter, Lindy; Salas, Ariel A; Philips Iii, Joseph B",Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,612,19

The standard of care for treatment of deep venous thrombosis in the emergency department (ED), supported by the 2008 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines, involves initiation of anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin, pentasaccharide, or unfractionated heparin. For selected appropriate patients with extensive acute proximal deep venous thrombosis, the ACCP guidelines now recommend thrombolysis in addition to anticoagulation to reduce not only the risk of pulmonary embolism but also the risk of subsequent postthrombotic syndrome and recurrent deep venous thrombosis. Postthrombotic syndrome is a potentially debilitating chronic cluster of lower-extremity symptoms occurring in 20% to 50% of deep venous thrombosis patients subsequent to the acute insult, sometimes not until years later. A strategy of early thrombus burden reduction or frank removal might reduce the incidence of postthrombotic syndrome, as per natural history studies, venous thrombectomy data, observations after systemic and catheter-directed thrombolysis, and the still-limited number of randomized trials of catheter-directed thrombolysis (with anticoagulation) versus anticoagulation alone. Contemporary invasive (endovascular) treatments mitigate the drawbacks historically associated with thrombolytic approaches by means of intrathrombus delivery of drugs with greater fibrin specificity and lower allergenicity, followed by mechanical dispersion to accelerate lysis and then aspiration of remaining drug and clot debris. With a 2016 target completion date, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute--sponsored Acute Venous Thrombosis: Thrombus Removal With Adjunctive Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis trial is comparing the safety and efficacy, in terms of both deep venous thrombosis and postthrombotic syndrome parameters, of the most evolved pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis devices versus standard anticoagulation therapy alone. This article reviews the grounds for use of adjunctive thrombolysis in patients with acute proximal deep venous thrombosis and begins to identify types of deep venous thrombosis patients encountered in the ED who might benefit most from multidisciplinary consideration of early referral for possible endovascular therapy.","Pollack, Charles V",Annals of emergency medicine,612,1

METHODS We conducted a single center retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of consecutive ischemic stroke patients transferred to our center for consideration of endovascular therapy. Patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of patients transferred from facilities where CTP (using automated RAPID software) was routinely performed and group 2 consisted of patients transferred from facilities that did not perform perfusion imaging. RESULTS We identified a total of 132 patients, all of whom were transferred to our center, from April 2014 to April 2017. There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. A total of 34 patients were transferred from a facility after CTP (group 1) and 98 were transferred from a facility with no CTP (group 2). Door to puncture time was significantly shorter for patients in group 1 compared with those in group 2 (median 12 (IQR 8-16) min and 48.5 (32.8-71.8) min, respectively; P<0.001). Despite obtaining additional pre-transfer imaging in group 1, there was no difference in door in and door out times at the referring facilities compared with group 2. CONCLUSIONS We found that triaging from a primary stroke center after CTP RAPID was feasible and significantly reduced the door to puncture time without any significant delay in the transfer process.","Aghaebrahim, Amin; Sauvageau, Eric; Aguilar-Salinas, Pedro; Cortez, Gustavo; Santos, Roberta; Hanel, Ricardo A",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,612,16

Although surgery remains the mainstay of curative treatment, modern therapies integrate a variety of neoadjuvant and adjuvant strategies and have achieved dramatic improvements in survival. Extensive tumour loads, which have traditionally been considered unresectable, are now amenable to curative treatment through systemic conversion chemotherapies followed by a variety of interventions such as augmentation of the healthy liver through portal vein occlusion, staged surgeries or ablation modalities. Liver transplantation is established in selected patients with hepatocellular carcinoma but is now emerging as a promising option in many other types of tumour such as perihilar cholangiocarcinomas, neuroendocrine or colorectal liver metastases. In this Review, we summarize the available therapies for the treatment of malignant liver tumours, with an emphasis on surgical and ablative approaches and how they align with other therapies such as modern anticancer drugs or radiotherapy.

The reported SAR of COVID-19 varied in a broad range, and between different contact settings. METHODOLOGY We conducted a meta-analysis on the SAR of COVID-19 with adherence to the PRISMA guideline. We searched published literatures and preprints in international databases of PubMed and medRxiv, and in five major Chinese databases as of 20 April 2020, using the following search terms: (""COVID-19"" and ""secondary attack rate"") or (""COVID-19"" and ""close contact""). The random effect model was chosen for pooled analyses, using R (version 3.6.3). RESULTS A total of 1,136 references were retrieved and 18 of them remained after screening. The pooled SAR of COVID-19 was 0.07 (95%: 0.03-0.12) in general. It differed significantly between contact settings, peaking in households (0.20, 95%: 0.15-0.28), followed by in social gatherings (0.06, 95%: 0.03-0.10). The point estimates of the pooled SARs in health facilities, transports, and work/study settings were all as low as 0.01. Among all the secondary cases, the proportion of asymptomatic infections was estimated to be 0.17 (95% CI: 0.09 - 0.34). The proportion was higher in households (0.26, 95% CI: 0.12-0.56), than in other contact settings. CONCLUSIONS The transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 is much higher in households than in other scenarios. Identification of asymptomatic secondary infections should be enhanced in households.","Tian, Ting; Huo, Xiang",Journal of infection in developing countries,612,1

OBJECTIVES To identify the clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with the severe incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS All adult patients (≥18 years old) consecutively admitted in Dabieshan Medical Center from January 30, 2020 to February 11, 2020 were collected and reviewed. Only patients diagnosed with COVID-19 according to WHO interim guidance were included in this retrospective cohort study. RESULTS A total of 108 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Twenty-five patients (23.1%, 25/108) developed severe disease, and of those 12 (48%, 12/25) patients died. Advanced age, co-morbidities with hypertension, higher blood leukocyte count, neutrophil count, higher sensitive C-reactive protein level, D-dimer level, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation Ⅱ (APECHE Ⅱ) score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were associated with greater risk of development of severe COVID-19, and so were lower lymphocyte count and albumin level. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of severe COVID-19 associated with higher SOFA score (OR 2.450, 1.302-4.608; p = 0.005), and lymphocyte count less than 0.8×109 per L (OR 9.017, 2.808-28.857; p <0.001) on admission. The higher SOFA score (OR 2.402, 1.313-4.395; p = 0.004) on admission was identified as risk factor for in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS Lymphocytopenia and the higher SOFA score on admission could help clinicians to identify patients with high risk for developing severe COVID-19.

Glaucoma is a common neurodegenerative disease in which neuronal levels of NAD decline. Repleting NAD via dietary supplementation of nicotinamide (a precursor to NAD) is effective in preventing retinal ganglion cell neurodegeneration in mouse models. Supporting this, short-term oral nicotinamide treatment in human glaucoma patients provides a recovery of retinal ganglion cell function implying a protection of visual function. Despite this, the mechanism of neuroprotection and full effects of nicotinamide on retinal ganglion cells is unclear. Glaucoma is a complex neurodegenerative disease in which a mix of healthy, stressed, and degenerating retinal ganglion cells co-exist, and in which retinal ganglion cells display compartmentalized degeneration across their visual trajectory. Therefore, we assess the effects of nicotinamide on retinal ganglion cells in normal physiological conditions and across a range of glaucoma relevant insults. We confirm neuroprotection afforded by nicotinamide in rodent models which represent isolated ocular hypertensive, axon degenerative, and mitochondrial degenerative insults. We define a small molecular weight metabolome for the retina, optic nerve, and superior colliculus which demonstrates that ocular hypertension induces widespread metabolic disruption that can be prevented by nicotinamide. Nicotinamide provides these neuroprotective effects by increasing oxidative phosphorylation, buffering and preventing metabolic stress, and increasing mitochondrial size and motility whilst simultaneously dampening action potential firing frequency. These data support continued determination of the utility of long-term NAM treatment as a neuroprotective therapy for human glaucoma. One Sentence Summary The NAD precursor nicotinamide has a potent neuroprotective effect in the retina and optic nerve, targeting neuronal function, metabolism, and mitochondrial function.","Tribble, James R; Otmani, Amin; Sun, Shanshan; Ellis, Sevannah A; Cimaglia, Gloria; Vohra, Rupali; Jöe, Melissa; Lardner, Emma; Venkataraman, Abinaya P; Domínguez-Vicent, Alberto; Kokkali, Eirini; Rho, Seungsoo; Jóhannesson, Gauti; Burgess, Robert W; Fuerst, Peter G; Brautaset, Rune; Kolko, Miriam; Morgan, James E; Crowston, Jonathan G; Votruba, Marcela; Williams, Pete A",bioRxiv,612,10

In addition to measurements typical of legacy neuropsychological tests, Miro also quantifies functions that are currently left to subjective clinical impressions such as motor function, language, and speech. Objective: Studies were conducted to measure Miro's concurrent validity, test-retest reliability, and amnestic MCI classification performance. Method: Spearman correlations were calculated to estimate the concurrent validity of Miro and legacy variables using data from 207 study participants. Twenty-six healthy controls were assessed at three time points to evaluate the test-retest reliability of Miro test scores. Reliability was quantified with the scores' intraclass correlations. Learning effects were measured as trends over three assessments. A machine learning algorithm combined Miro scores into a risk score to distinguish 65 healthy controls, 21 amnestic MCI (aMCI) participants, and 17 non-amnestic MCI (naMCI) participants. Results: Significant correlations of Miro variables with legacy neuropsychological test variables were observed. Longitudinal studies show agreement of subsequent measurements and minimal learning effects. The Risk Score distinguished aMCI from healthy controls with an Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve (AUROC) of 0.97; the naMCI participants and controls were separated with an AUROC of 0.80, and the combined (aMCI + naMCI) group was separated from healthy controls with an AUROC of 0.89. Conclusion: Miro includes valid and reliable versions of scores from legacy neuropsychological test scores and a machine-learning derived risk score that effectively distinguishes healthy controls and individuals with MCI.","Sloane, K.

Interestingly, female players tended to perform better than male players, even though men played more games per day. To understand this relationship, we explore the profiles of our top players in more depth.

Conclusion This work provides a rich atlas of healthy pregnancies to direct functional studies investigating the epigenetic differences in first and third trimester placentae. Lay Abstract The human body produces microRNAs which affect the expression of genes and proteins. This study uses next generation sequencing to identify the microRNA profile of first and third trimester human placentae using a large cohort (N=113 first, N=47 third trimester). All pregnancies resulted in healthy babies. We identify microRNAs with significantly different expression between first and third trimester, as well as stably expressed microRNAs. This work provides a baseline for future studies which may use microRNAs to monitor maternal-fetal health throughout pregnancy.","Gonzalez, Tania L; Eisman, Laura E; Joshi, Nikhil V; Flowers, Amy E; Wu, Di; Wang, Yizhou; Santiskulvong, Chintda; Tang, Jie; Buttle, Rae A; Sauro, Erica; Clark, Ekaterina L; DiPentino, Rosemarie; Jefferies, Caroline A; Chan, Jessica L; Lin, Yayu; Zhu, Yazhen; Afshar, Yalda; Tseng, Hsian-Rong; Taylor, Kent; Williams, John; Pisarska, Margareta D",bioRxiv,612,1

When the coronavirus outbreak emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the government of Vietnam considered it a highly contagious disease and immediately implemented all necessary measures to protect people from the emerging pandemic, even if these strict measures resulted in massive economic losses. The chapter then introduces the regulatory framework which enabled the government and other non-state actors in Vietnam to fight the epidemic effectively. It also discusses how Vietnam contained the spread of the virus in practice from the perspectives of health and medical policy, information and technology, economic policy, and international cooperation. Ultimately, Vietnam’s unique response derives from four factors: (1) the policy that prioritized public health over economic considerations;(2) Vietnam’s having been well prepared for dealing with contagious diseases since the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the government immediately introducing strict measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 when it emerged in China;(3) the legal framework specifying the roles of the central and local governments to avoid any bureaucratic delays in making decisions in an epidemic;and (4) the government flexibly combining coercive means with deliberate action, public education, effective governance, and effective coordination with the community and the private sector. © the several contributors 2021.","Nguyen, C.; Phan, T.",Covid-19 in Asia: Law and Policy Contexts,612,1

The recent inclusion of food safety culture in horticulture standards will drive the need for better understanding, integration into business activities, and monitoring, to help mitigate foodborne incidents in horticulture. Scope and approach The purpose of this review was to identify definitions of food safety culture and methods of measuring its performance in the context of the Australian horticulture industry. Investigation of how to better apply and integrate a positive food safety culture into existing food safety management systems was conducted. A roadmap for food safety culture improvement in Australian horticulture is presented, highlighting the challenges and opportunities. Key findings and conclusions To guide the development of a mature culture of food safety, mixed-method approaches to performance assessment were found to be the most comprehensive, valid, and offer the most potential for use by horticulture businesses. Food safety culture can be developed by using feedback from regular culture assessments that identify weaknesses and opportunities for improvement, leading to increased knowledge, alignment of attitudes, and better food safety and hygiene behaviour. To this end, the development of measurement tools specific to horticulture operations would be beneficial. Despite unforeseen challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic, the Australian horticulture industry continues to investigate the efficacy of its food safety management.","Frankish, Elizabeth J.; McAlpine, Graham Mahoney Deon Oladele Bisi Luning Pieternel A.; Ross, Thomas Bowman John P.; Bozkurt, Hayriye",Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology,612,1

By examining the rape in the pericope and other key passages in the Old Testament, this article argues that it points towards care and justice for victims of rape, and prosecution of rapists. These social ethics are analysed in relation to the contemporary rape epidemic during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. Like the rape in Genesis, rape victims in Nigeria have little or no access to getting justice and counselling from society, non-government organisations and faith-based organisations, against their aggressors (the rapists). These problems highlight the relevance of this biblical narrative for the policyholders, the government and churches in Nigeria. Intra/interdisciplinary implications: This research is based on the impact of rape on the victim and the aggressor in Genesis 34:1–28. Similar to what is obtainable amongst Nigerians during the COVID-19 pandemic, Genesis 34:1–28 reveals that rape has far reaching implications on the victim and the aggressor. It leads to low self-esteem, hate, suicide as well as the death of the aggressor or victim.

The reported data of confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases in Karnataka from 1 July 2020 to 4 July 2021 is utilized to tune the model's parameters, and an ensemble forecast is done from 5 July 2021 to 30 June 2022. The ensemble is built with 972 members by varying seven critical parameters that quantify the uncertainty in the spread dynamics (antibody waning, viral mutation) and interventions (pharmaceutical, non-pharmaceutical). The probability of Wave-3, the peak date distribution, and the peak caseload distribution are estimated from the ensemble forecast. Our analysis shows that the most significant causal factors are compliance to Covid-appropriate behavior, daily vaccination rate, and the immune escape new variant emergence-time. These causal factors determine when and how severe the Wave-3 of COVID-19 would be in Karnataka. We observe that when compliance to Covid-Appropriate Behavior is good (i.e., lockdown-like compliance), the emergence of new immune-escape variants beyond Sep '21 is unlikely to induce a new wave. A new wave is inevitable when compliance to Covid-Appropriate Behavior is only partial. Increasing the daily vaccination rates reduces the peak active caseload at Wave-3. Consequently, the hospitalization, ICU, and Oxygen requirements also decrease. Compared to Wave-2, the ensemble forecast indicates that the number of daily confirmed cases of children (0-17 years) at Wave-3's peak could be seven times more on average. Our results provide insights to plan science-informed policy interventions and public health response.","Ganesan, S.; Subramani, D.; Anandh, T.; Ghose, D.; Babu, G. R.",,612,1

Lauded as one example to alleviate poverty, the operating assumption is that these strategies provide alternatives to mainstream development assistance. Notwithstanding their potential effects, the pathways generating livelihood change and their long-term implications for processes of citizenship formation and state society relations remain unclear. Drawing from an interdisciplinary study of social and economic change in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, we analyze household surveys and qualitative interviews to examine how individuals manage their limited income through a balance of social grants, economic remittances, labor migration and strategic task-shifting. Though more than half of the households receive some form of pension support from the national government, many continue depending on remittances from household members living elsewhere. Social grants additionally interrelate with health maintenance in complicated ways, evidenced by high HIV rates within the study region. We argue that while the distribution of grants helps alleviate financial stress, the structure of assistance programs is more symbolically than materially significant for many families. Despite government assistance, families require social network mobilization and resources to access and secure healthcare and other basic needs.","Winchester, Margaret S.; King, Brian Rishworth Andrea","Wellbeing, Space and Society",612,13

These companies provide a single platform for patients to directly initiate televisits and purchase prescription drugs. Early platforms treated minor dermatologic conditions with medications that historically lacked routine monitoring;they have since expanded their scope of practice. We aimed to characterize DTC companies providing dermatologic care, with analysis of the factors that enabled DTC growth, as well as the ethical and practical implications. Through a literature search and Google queries, we identified seven DTC dermatology companies employing variations of a model with three main components: a triage questionnaire, telehealth services (primarily asynchronous), and custom branded drug delivery. Rising healthcare costs, improved technology, and drug patent expirations have enabled DTC growth, with aggressive marketing fueling a growth in customer base. The rise of DTC companies prompts questions about patients acting as consumers in healthcare. While DTC offers greater autonomy for patients to receive care on their terms and convenience, the removal of gate-keepers could have unanticipated negative effects. For instance, DTC may make doctor-patient relationships transactional and raise financial conflicts of interests. Furthermore, there are uncertainties regarding quality of care;studies have reported poor adherence to guidelines, misdiagnosis and barriers to follow-up. DTC solutions bypass traditional healthcare systems, further fragmenting care and creating room for error. COVID-19 has increased telemedicine adoption, possibly fueling growth and funding of DTC companies. As such, it will be vital to monitor the regulatory, ethical, and patient-centered outcomes of DTC telemedicine.","Ranpariya, V.; Lipoff, J. B.",Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,612,14

Molecular diagnostic tests for COVID-19 emerged shortly after the isolation of SARS-CoV-2, however, serological tests based on antiviral antibody detection, revealing previous exposure to the virus, required longer developmental phases, due to the need for correctly folded and glycosylated antigens. The delay between the identification of a new virus and the development of reliable serodiagnostic tools limits our readiness for the control of a future epidemic. In this context, we propose the protozoan Leishmania tarentolae as an easy-to-handle micro-factory for the rapid production of viral antigens, to be used at the forefront of emerging epidemics. As a study model, we engineered L. tarentolae to express the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and report the ability of the purified RBD antigen to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a sensitivity and reproducibility comparable to that of a reference antigen produced in human cells. This is the first application of an antigen produced in L. tarentolae for the serodiagnosis of a Coronaviridae infection. Based on our results, we propose L. tarentolae as an effective system for viral antigen production, even in countries that lack high-tech cell factories.","Varotto-Boccazzi, I.; Manenti, A.; Dapporto, F.; Gourlay, L.; Bisaglia, B.; Gabrieli, P.; Forneris, F.; Faravelli, S.; Bollati, V.; Zuccotti, G.

BACKGROUND: Molecular studies, especially proteomics, can be considered as suitable approaches for discovering the hidden aspect of the disease. METHODS: Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) of three patients with demonstrated severe condition (S-COVID-19) were compared to healthy cases by a proteomics study. Cytoscape software and STRING database were used to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The central DEPs were identified through topological analysis of the network. ClueGO+CluePedia were applied to find the biological processes related to the central nodes. MCODE molecular complex detection (MCODE) was used to discover protein complexes. RESULTS: A total of 242 DEPs from among 256 query ones were included in the network. Centrality analysis of the network assigned 16 hub-bottlenecks, nine of which were presented in the highest-scored protein complex. Ten protein complexes were determined. APOA1 was identified as the protein complex seed, and APP, EGF, and C3 were the top hub-bottlenecks of the network. The results specify that up-regulation of C3 and down-regulation of APOA1 in urine play a role in the stiffness in respiration and, accordingly, the severity of COVID-19. Moreover, dysregulation of APP and APOA1 could both contribute to the possible adverse effects of COVID-19 on the nervous system. CONCLUSION: The introduced central proteins of the S-COVID-19 interaction network, particularly APOA1, can be considered as diagnostic and therapeutic targets related to the coronavirus disease after being approved with complementary studies.","Zamanian Azodi, Mona; Arjmand, Babak; Zali, Alireza; Razzaghi, Mohammadreza",Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,612,1

This study was conducted to investigate viral persistence. METHODS We inoculated confluent monolayers of Vero cells with SARS-CoV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 TCID50 and passaged the remaining cells every 4 to 8 days for a total of 11 passages. Virus was titrated at each passage by limited dilution assay and nucleocapsid antigen was detected by Western blot and immunofluoresence assays. The presence of viral particles in passage 11 cells was assessed by electron microscopy. Changes in viral genomic sequences during persistent infection were examined by DNA sequencing. RESULTS Cytopathic effect was extensive after initial inoculation but diminished with serial passages. Infectious virus was detected after each passage and viral growth curves were identical for parental virus stock and virus obtained from passage 11 cells. Nucleocapsid antigen was detected in the majority of cells after initial inoculation but in only 10%-40% of cells at passages 2-11. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of viral particles in passage 11 cells. Sequence analysis at passage 11 revealed fixed mutations in the spike (S) gene and ORFs 7a-8b but not in the nucleocapsid (N) gene. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV can establish a persistent infection in vitro. The mechanism for viral persistence is consistent with the formation of a carrier culture whereby a limited number of cells are infected with each round of virus replication and release. Persistence is associated with selected mutations in the SARS-CoV genome. This model may provide insight into SARS-related lung pathology and mechanisms by which humans and animals can serve as reservoirs for infection.","Palacios, Gustavo; Jabado, Omar; Renwick, Neil; Briese, Thomas; Lipkin, W Ian",Chinese medical journal,612,11

METHOD We conducted a literature review of articles in the CAIRN, SCOPUS and PsycINFO databases using the keywords zazou, adolescent and COVID-19. RESULTS The zazou movement was a manifestation of young people's denial of the war through derision. Initially discredited, it was subsequently violently repressed by collaborationists and supporters of Marshal Pétain, as it was interpreted as an enemy of politics. In particular, it ran contrary to the Vichy regime's desire that young French men should spearhead the national revolution. The reaction among young people was to feel that they were being used by ageing politicians, who they considered were out of touch with reality. With respect to adolescents during the COVID-19 crisis, our review found that the French government has pressurised them to make sacrifices for the rest of the population, and has ignored their greater need for social links with peers. Many adolescents feel that they have been forgotten, in the midst of measures that have been imposed upon them with no explanation. This may have led, as in the 1940s, to a feeling of being instrumentalised and demonised by politicians. CONCLUSION We argue that, in both cases, the dominant oppressive atmosphere has fostered similar behaviours and mental mechanisms. We therefore recommend that, rather than demonising young people, efforts should be made to include them in decision-making processes, in order to improve their understanding of the situation and encourage them to feel included.","De Weer, Camille; Zdanowicz, Nicolas; Dubois, Thomas",Psychiatria Danubina,612,16

We previously demonstrated that deletions in different regions of the 5' UTR significantly reduced viral RNA translation and infectivity. Such observations suggested strongly that viral RNA translation and replication could be blocked if highly specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS-ODNs) were applied to target crucial sites within the 5' and 3' UTRs. In this study, seven phosphorothioate AS-ODNs were synthesized, and the antiviral activity was evaluated by Lipofectin transfection of HeLa cells with AS-ODNs followed by infection of CVB3. Analysis by Western blotting, reverse transcription-PCR, and viral plaque assay demonstrated that viral protein synthesis, genome replication, and infectivity of CVB3 were strongly inhibited by the AS-ODNs complementary to different regions of the 5' and 3' UTRs. The most effective sites are located at the proximate terminus of the 5' UTR (AS-1), the proximate terminus of the 3' UTR (AS-7), the core sequence of the internal ribosome entry site (AS-2), and the translation initiation codon region (AS-4). These AS-ODNs showed highly sequence-specific and dose-dependent inhibitory effects on both viral protein synthesis and RNA replication. It is noteworthy that the highest inhibitory activities were obtained with AS-1 and AS-7 targeting the termini of the 5' and 3' UTRs. The percent inhibition values of AS-1 and AS-7 for CVB3 protein VP1 synthesis and RNA replication were 70.6 and 79.6 for AS-1 and 73.7 and 79.7 for AS-7, respectively.

There is no consensus on optimal vitamin B12 supplementation in postbariatric patients. The objective of this study was to compare three different regimes. METHODS In this retrospective matched cohort study, we included 63 patients with methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels ≥300 nmol/L. Group A (n = 21) received 6 intramuscular (im) vitamin B12 injections including a loading dose, group B (n = 21) received 3 im vitamin B12 injections without loading dose and group C (n = 21) received no im vitamin B12 injections. RESULTS The total post-bariatric patient population consisted of 14 males (22.2 %) and 49 women (77.8 %) with a mean current body mass index of 30.6 ± 8.0 kg/m2. There was no significant difference in vitamin B12 and MMA levels between 3 groups at baseline. There was a significant difference in follow-up vitamin B12 levels of group A compared to group B (p = 0.02) and group A compared to group C (p = 0.03). In the follow-up results, there is also a significant decrease in MMA levels of group A compared to group B (p = 0.02), group A compared to group C (p < 0.001), and group B compared to group C (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS In this study, a shorter injection regime is probably not sufficient to treat a vitamin B12 deficiency. An injection regime with 6 injections recovered all vitamin B12 deficiencies biochemically. MMA levels cannot recover spontaneously over time without additional im injection regime.","Smelt, H J M; Pouwels, S; Said, M; Berghuis, K A; Boer, A K; Smulders, J F",Obesity surgery,612,17

We have developed a murine model to specifically examine the lung injury due to CD8(+) T cell recognition of an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) transgene on lung epithelium in the absence of replicating virus, after adoptive transfer. Lung injury is largely mediated by chemokines expressed by the epithelial cells upon T cell recognition mediated by TNF-alpha. To determine the critical source of TNF-alpha, HA-specific TNF(-/-) CD8(+) T cells were transferred into HA transgenic animals, and lung injury was not observed, though these T cells exhibited no defect in antiviral activity in vivo. This indicates that the initiating event in the injury process is Ag-specific expression of TNF-alpha by antiviral CD8(+) T cells upon recognition of alveolar epithelial Ag, and that the effector activities responsible for viral clearance may be dissociable from those resulting in immunopathology.","Xu, Lumei; Yoon, Heesik; Zhao, Min Q; Liu, Jun; Ramana, Chilakamarti V; Enelow, Richard I",Journal of immunology,612,33

In 70% of the patients with diarrhea, at least one potential enteropathogen was detected. Stool virus was detected by electron microscopy in 17% (44 of 256), adenovirus in 6.6% (17 of 256), and coronavirus in 11.3% (29 of 256) of the patients. Adenovirus and coronavirus were detected more frequently in patients with diarrhea than in patients without diarrhea [adenovirus 10% (13 of 136) vs. 3.3% (4 of 120), p = 0.0129; coronavirus 15% (21 of 136) vs. 6.6% (8 of 120), p = 0.0142]. Sixty-one percent of patients harboring stool virus were coinfected by another enteropathogen. Pathogens other than stool virus were detected more frequently in patients harboring adenovirus (82%) than in patients without stool virus (48%, p < 0.025). Adenovirus and coronavirus are frequently detected in stools of HIV- infected patients and may contribute to diarrhea. Adenovirus infection may facilitate the occurrence of other intestinal pathogens. Due to frequent coinfections, detection of stool viruses reduces the rate of diarrhea of unknown origin only by approximately 5%.","Schmidt, W; Schneider, T; Heise, W; Weinke, T; pple, H J; Stöffler-Meilicke, M; Liesenfeld, O; Ignatius, R; Zeitz, M; Riecken, E O; Ullrich, R",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes and human retrovirology : official publication of the International Retrovirology Association,612,20

These hamper their potential societal benefit and impairs the ability to quickly respond to emerging new pathogens. This is especially worrisome since new pathogens are emerging at all-time high rates of over one per year, and many age-old pathogens are still not vaccine preventable.Through interviews with 20 key-opinion-leaders (KOLs), this study identified innovation barriers that increase vaccine development timelines. These innovation barriers were visualized, and their underlying causes revealed by means of qualitative root cause analysis. Based on a survey the innovation barriers were quantitatively ranked based on their relative impact on both regular, and Covid-19 vaccine development timelines. KOLs identified 20 key innovation barriers, and mapping these barriers onto the Vaccine Innovation Cycle model revealed that all phases of vaccine development were affected. Affected by most barriers is the area between the preclinical studies and the market entry. Difficult hand-off between academia and industry, lack of funding, and lack of knowledge of pathogen targets were often mentioned as causes. Quantitative survey responses from 93 KOLs showed that general vaccine development and Covid-19 vaccine development are impacted by distinct sets of innovation barriers. For the general vaccine development three barriers were perceived of the highest impact; limited ROI for vaccines addressing disease with limited market size, limited ROI for vaccines compared to non-vaccine projects, and academia not being able to progress beyond proof of principle. Of highest impact on Covid-19 vaccine development, are lack of knowledge concerning pathogen target, high risk of upscaling unlicensed vaccines, and proof of principle not meeting late-stage requirements. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that barriers hampering timelines in vaccine development are present across the Vaccine Innovation Cycle. Prioritizing the impact of barriers in general, and in Covid-19 vaccine development, shows clear differences that can be used to inform policies to speed up development in both war and peace time.","Janse, Marga; Brouwers, Thomas; Claassen, Eric; Hermans, Peter; van de Burgwal, Linda",Front Public Health,612,24

Ce virus a été rapidement responsable d’une pandémie majeure. La maladie COVID-19 se manifeste souvent par des symptômes respiratoires, néanmoins des manifestations digestives ont été rapportées soulevant le potentiel tropisme du SARS-CoV2 pour le tractus digestif. Objectifs Préciser les manifestations digestives liées au SARS-CoV2 et leur impact sur le pronostic de la maladie. Matériels et méthodes Une étude rétrospective incluant tous les patients hospitalisés pour une infection à COVID-19 confirmée par une RT-PCR et/ou un test rapide sur une période de 3 mois (1er novembre 2020 au 31 janvier 2021). Résultats Au total, 133 parmi 303 patients hospitalisés pour une infection COVID-19 confirmée, avaient des manifestations digestives (44 %). L’âge moyen de ces patients était 63,4±14 ans avec une prédominance masculine (sex-ratio=1,8). Les patients étaient obèses dans 17 % des cas. Une comorbidité était notée chez la majorité des patients: le diabète (46 %), l’hypertension artérielle (40 %), l’insuffisance coronaire (13 %) et la dyslipidémie (10,5 %). Aucuns malades n’avaient une pathologie gastrique ou hépatique sous-jacente. Les manifestations digestives étaient révélatrices de la maladie dans 68% des cas et isolés sans signes respiratoires dans 17 % des cas. Le délai moyen d’hospitalisation était 8±4 jours. Les principaux symptômes digestifs étaient la diarrhée (34,6 %), les vomissements (34,6 %), la douleur abdominale (26 %) et les nausées (10 %). L’examen clinique a trouvé une sensibilité abdominale dans 10 % des cas. Les principales anomalies constatées à la biologie hépatique étaient la cytolyse (52 %), l’hyper bilirubinémie (9 %) et la cholestase hépatique (10 %). La lipasémie était élevée chez deux patients (1,5 %). Un scanner abdominal a été pratiqué chez 7 patients montrant un kyste hydatique du foie non compliqué (1 cas), une iléo-jéjunite (1 cas), une cholangite non spécifique (1 cas), une hypertrophie de la tète du pancréas (1 cas) et une ascite de faible abondance (1 cas). Le reste des patients avait un scanner abdominal normal. Les formes graves étaient notées dans 41 % des cas. La perturbation du bilan hépatique était associée à des formes graves dans 42 % des cas. Cent neuf patients (82 %) avaient reçu une oxygénothérapie au cours de leur hospitalisation pour des manifestations respiratoires associées. L’évolution était fatale dans 19,5 % des cas. Conclusion Devant la fréquence des manifestations digestives, le tropisme entérocytaire du SARS-CoV-2 est bien établi. Le tropisme hépatique est aussi probable. Ces manifestations peuvent être révélatrices d’une infection COVID-19 mais aussi peuvent être à l’origine d’erreurs et de retards diagnostiques en l’absence de manifestations respiratoires.","Mnif, K.; Smaoui, F.; Ben Hmida, S.; Hana Chaabouni, H.; Gassara, F.; Rekik, K.; Koubaa, M.; Marrakchi, C.; Ben Jemaa, M.",Infectious Diseases Now,612,27

The present study takes a neural trait approach, examining whether the temporal dynamics of resting EEG networks are associated with inter-individual differences in prosociality. In two experimental sessions, we collected 55 healthy males' resting EEG, their self-reported prosocial concern and values, and their incentivized prosocial behavior across different reward domains (money, time) and social contexts (collective, individual). By means of EEG microstate analysis we identified the temporal coverage of four canonical resting networks (microstates A, B, C, and D) and their mutual communication in order to examine their association with an aggregated index of prosociality. Participants with a higher coverage of microstate A and more transitions from microstate C to A were more prosocial. Our study demonstrates that temporal dynamics of intrinsic brain networks can be linked to complex social behavior. On the basis of previous findings on links of microstate A with sensory processing, our findings suggest that participants with a tendency to engage in bottom-up processing during rest behave more prosocially than others.","Schiller, Bastian; Kleinert, Tobias; Teige-Mocigemba, Sarah; Klauer, Karl Christoph; Heinrichs, Markus",Sci Rep,612,24

Physicians and health care workers are at added risk of exposure and infection during the course of patient care. Because of the rapid spread of this disease through respiratory droplets, health care workers who come in close contact with the upper aerodigestive tract during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, such as otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, are particularly at risk. A set of safety recommendations was created based on a review of the literature and communications with physicians with firsthand knowledge of safety procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Observations: A high number of health care workers were infected during the first phase of the pandemic in the city of Wuhan, China. Subsequently, by adopting strict safety precautions, other regions were able to achieve high levels of safety for health care workers without jeopardizing the care of patients. The most common procedures related to the examination and treatment of upper aerodigestive tract diseases were reviewed. Each category was reviewed based on the potential risk imposed to health care workers. Specific recommendations were made based on the literature, when available, or consensus best practices. Specific safety recommendations were made for performing tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance: Preserving a highly skilled health care workforce is a top priority for any community and health care system. Based on the experience of health care systems in Asia and Europe, by following strict safety guidelines, the risk of exposure and infection of health care workers could be greatly reduced while providing high levels of care. The provided recommendations, which may evolve over time, could be used as broad guidance for all health care workers who are involved in the care of patients with COVID-19.","Givi, Babak; Schiff, Bradley A; Chinn, Steven B; Clayburgh, Daniel; Iyer, N Gopalakrishna; Jalisi, Scharukh; Moore, Michael G; Nathan, Cherie-Ann; Orloff, Lisa A; O039,; Neill, James P; Parker, Noah; Zender, Chad; Morris, Luc G T; Davies, Louise",JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,612,16

This virus causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has led to numerous deaths worldwide. A large percentage of infected patients present asymptomatically, augmenting the spread of the virus. Symptomatic COVID19 commonly causes mild to severe respiratory disease and fever, but some individuals experience serious complications that can result in death. Immune compromised, high risk, and elderly individuals are at an increased risk of more severe consequences of the illness such as respiratory failure, organ dysfunction, and shock. Cytokine storm (also known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS)), a systemic inflammatory response that can be triggered by an infection, has been associated with the symptom progression of COVID-19. This review evaluates several published studies that have implemented Tocilizumab (TCZ), an IL-6 receptor antibody (US20120253016A1), in COVID-19 treatment. Outcomes and biomarkers of patients treated with TCZ are compared to patients treated with standard of care regimens. Interleukin6 (IL-6), a prominent inflammatory cytokine involved in CRS in various inflammatory conditions, may have a vital role in the underlying mechanism involved in debilitating SARS-CoV-2 infections and could serve as a viable treatment target. Studies suggest that TCZ may aid in the recovery of patients with COVID-19 and reduce mortality.","Ali, Afroze; Kamjani, Milad H; Kesselman, Marc M",Recent patents on anti-infective drug discovery (Online),612,24

A major mechanism in epigenetics is the DNA methylation (DNAm). Hypo- and hyper-methylation are generalized responses to control gene expression however recent studies have demonstrated that classes of contaminants could mark specific DNAm signatures, that could usefully signal prior environmental exposure. We collected skin and blubber from 6 free-ranging fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) individuals sampled as a part of a previous published study in the northern Mediterranean Sea. Genomic DNA extracted from the skin of the fin whales and levels of contaminants measured in the blubber of the same individuals were used for DNAm profiling through reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). We tested the hypothesis that differences in the methylation patterns could be related to environmental exposure to contaminants and load in the whale tissues. The aims of this study were to determine the DNAm profiles of the methylation contexts (CpGs and non-CpGs) of differently contaminated groups using the RRBS, and to identify potential contaminant exposure related genes. Amount and proportion of methylcytosines in CpG and non-CpG regions (CHH and CHG) was very similar across the 6 samples. The proportion of methylcytosines sites in CpG was n = 32,682, the highest among all the sequence contexts (n = 3216 in CHH; n = 1743 in CHG). The majority of the methylcytosine occurred in the intron regions, followed by exon and promoter regions in CpG, CHH and CHG. Gene Ontology results indicated that DNAm affected genes that take place in cell differentiation and function in cutaneous, vascular and nervous systems. The identification of cellular response pathways allows a better understanding of the organism biological reaction to a specific environmental challenge and the development of sensitive tools based on the predictive responses.

Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 spread swiftly around world and infected more than 25 million people and caused more than 800,000 deaths in 188 countries. Chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD appear to be a risk factor for COVID-19; however, their prevalence remains controversial. In fact, studies in China reported lower rates of chronic respiratory conditions in patients with COVID-19 than in the general population, while the trend is reversed in the United States and Europe. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms of a possible interaction between COVID-19 and chronic respiratory diseases remain unknown, some observations can help to resolve them. Indeed, physiological changes, immune response, or medication used against SARS-CoV-2 may have greater impact on patients with chronic respiratory conditions, already debilitated by chronic inflammation, dyspnea, and the use of immunosuppressant drugs like corticosteroids. In this review, we discuss the importance and the impact of COVID-19 on asthmatics and COPD patients, the possible available treatments, and patient management during the pandemic.","Bouazza, Belaid; Hadj-Said, Dihia; Pescatore, Karen A; Chahed, Rachid",,612,16

We examined (1) the association between financial strain, occurring upon the outbreak of the virus, and loneliness among Israeli young people (aged 20–35);(2) the associations between cognitive social capital, psychological resources, and loneliness;and (3) whether these social and psychological resources were moderators in the financial strain–loneliness link. A real-time survey based on snowball sampling was conducted during April 2020 (N = 426). Hierarchical linear models were employed to explore associations between financial strain, cognitive social capital, psychological resources, and loneliness. Financial strain emerging during the pandemic was associated with greater loneliness. Cognitive social capital and optimism decreased loneliness. Sense of mastery moderated the financial strain–loneliness link. Policymakers must develop and extend mental health initiatives aimed at alleviating the psychological consequences of the pandemic and must also combat financial strain via unemployment compensation and social assistance programs.

The aim of the present study was to estimate whether the CRP level is able to act as a marker in indicating the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: Patients who complained cough or chest pain with or without fever were enrolled after laboratory confirmed of SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid via qRT-PCR. Chest computed tomography (CT) was then performed to classify the patients into mild, moderate and severe pneumonia groups according to the interim management guideline. Then linear regression models were applied to analyze the association between c-reactive protein (CRP) levels and severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: When compared to mild pneumonia, the adjusted-Odds Ratio were 11.46, p = 0.029 and 23.40, p = 0.025 in moderate and severe pneumonia, respectively. The area under receiver operation curve was 0.898 (95% CI 0.835, 0.962, p < 0.001). Higher plasma CRP level indicated severe COVID-19 pneumonia and longer inpatients duration. CONCLUSIONS: The level of plasma CRP was positively correlated to the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. Our findings could assist to discern patients of moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia from the mild ones. Our findings may be useful as an earlier indicator for severe illness and help physicians to stratify patients for intense care unit transfer.","Chen, Wei; Zheng, Kenneth I; Liu, Saiduo; Yan, Zhihan; Xu, Chongyong; Qiao, Zengpei",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,612,24

The consequence is that decisions are based on limited perception rather than the full value and meaning of what risk is, as a result, the way it is being tackled is incorrect. The individuals are often limited in their perceptions and ideas and do not embrace the full multifaceted nature of risk. Regulators and individuals want to follow norms and checklists or overuse models, simulations, and templates, thereby reducing responsibility for decision-making. At the same time, the wider use of technology and rules reduces the critical thinking of individuals. We advance the automation process by building robots that follow protocols and forget about the part of risk assessment that cannot be programed. Therefore, with this study, the objective of this study was to discover how people define risk, the influencing factors of risk perception and how they behave toward this perception. The authors also determine how the perception differed with age, gender, marital status, education level and region. The novelty of the research is related to individual risk perception during COVID-19, as this is a new and unknown phenomenon. Methodology: The research is based on the analysis of the self-administered purposely designed questionnaires we distributed across different social media platforms between February and June 2020 in Europe and in some cases was carried out as a interview over communication platforms such as “Skype,” “Zoom” and “Microsoft Teams.” The questionnaire was divided into four parts: Section 1 was designed to collect demographic information from the participants;Section 2 included risk definition statements obtained from literature and a preliminary discussion with peers;Section 3 included risk behavior statements;and Section 4 included statements on risk perception experiences. A five-point Likert Scale was provided, and participants were required to answer along a scale of “1” for “Strongly Agree” to “5” for “Strongly Disagree.” Participants also had the option to elaborate further and provide additional comments in an open-ended box provided at the end of the section. 466 valid responses were received. Thematic analysis was carried out to analyze the interviews and the open-ended questions, while the questionnaire responses were analyzed using various quantitative methods on IBM SPSS (version 23). Findings: The results of the analysis indicate that individuals evaluate the risk before making a decision and view risk as both a loss and opportunity. The study identifies nine factors influencing risk perception. Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that we can continue to develop models and rules, but as long as the risk is not understood, we will never achieve anything. © 2021 by Emerald Publishing Limited, All rights reserved.","Girlando, A.; Grima, S.; Boztepe, E.; Seychell, S.; Rupeika-Apoga, R.; Romanova, I.",Contemporary Studies in Economic and Financial Analysis,612,1

Twenty lung samples from patients SARS-CoV-2 infected (COVID-19 group) and 10 lung samples from adults who died from a severe respiratory H1N1pdm09 infection (H1N1 group) were tested. The tissue expression of IL-8/IL-17A was identified by immunohistochemistry, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain slides were used for neutrophil scoring. DNA was extracted from paraffin blocks, and genotyping was done in real time-PCR for two IL17A target polymorphisms. Tissue expression increasing of IL-8/IL-17A and a higher number of neutrophils were identified in samples from the H1N1 group compared to the COVID-19 group. The distribution of genotype frequencies in the IL17A gene was not statistically significant between groups. However, the G allele (GG and GA) of rs3819025 was correlated with higher tissue expression of IL-17A in the COVID-19 group. SARS-CoV-2 virus evokes an exacerbated response of the host's immune system but differs from that observed in the H1N1pdm09 infection since the IL-8/IL-17A tissue expression, and lung neutrophilic recruitment may be decreased.

Rhein is a major component of the medicinal Rhubarb. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Rhein protects against renal injury and explore its underlying mechanism. METHODS: 5/6 nephrectomization (5/6 Nx) was operated on Sprague-Dawley rats. Human kidney tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The level of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCr) was examined. Kidney tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to check the morphology. The cell viability was examined. The levels of cytokines and chemokines were measured by ELISA kit. The protein expression was determined by western blot. RESULTS: Rhein significantly decreased SCr and BUN levels in 5/6 Nx rat. The morphologic findings indicated noteworthy amelioration of the damaged renal tissue in Rhein-treated rats. Rhein significantly protects HK-2 cells from LPS-mediated apoptosis. The productions of inflammatory signaling molecules (TNF-&#945;, IL-6 and MCP-1) were inhibited by Rhein. LPS-induced NF-&#954;B activation was also attenuated by Rhein via blocking its nuclear translocation by inhibiting phosphorylation of I&#954;B&#945;.

This study aims to quantify the effect of these delays on visual acuity (VA) outcomes and optical coherence tomography (OCT) features for patients receiving treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), retinal vein occlusions (RVO) and diabetic macular oedema (DMO) and correlate to the Royal College of Ophthalmologists guidelines (RCOphth). METHODS: A retrospective data analysis of an electronic medical record was performed on a random sample of eyes receiving anti-VEGF injections for nAMD, RVO or DMO. Data collected included age, sex, reason for injection, number of weeks delay if > 8 weeks from that planned, VA at baseline and follow-up and the OCT features, if delayed. For those eyes not delayed, a visual acuity at 20 weeks was recorded to provide a control group. RESULTS: A sample of 981 eyes (858 patients) were analysed. There was a delay in review of 8 weeks or more in 39.6% of patients of which 30.4% had since returned for review (28.4% nAMD, 37.6% RVO and 30.0% DMO). There was no demographic difference identified between the delayed and non-delayed patients; however, the delayed group was significantly more likely to have better vision in their non-treated eye (p = 0.0003). A statistically significant difference was found in the change in VA between the delayed and the not-delayed group for eyes with nAMD (p = 0.001) but not for RVO or DMO. For the delayed group, mean CMT increased by 33 and 100 µm, respectively, for nAMD and RVO and decreased by 7.8 µm for DMO. The VA of 89.7% of DMO eyes returned to baseline, compared to 74.6% and 76.9% of nAMD and RVO eyes. CONCLUSION: The RCOphth guidance to prioritise intravitreal injections for nAMD over DMO appears appropriate in this cohort but not for RVO. Eyes with nAMD experienced the greatest loss of vision with treatment delay, and nAMD and RVO eyes were less likely to return to baseline on restarting treatment.","Stone, Lydia G; Grinton, Michael E; Talks, James S",Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,612,16

This paper explores the relationship between local vehicle emissions and the winter haze in Beijing before and during the COVID-19 lockdown based on an integrated analysis framework, which combines a real-time on-road emission inventory, in situ air quality observations, and a localized numerical modeling system. We found that traffic emissions decreased substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic, but its imbalanced emission abatement of NOx (76%, 125.3 Mg/day) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs, 53%, 52.9 Mg/day) led to a significant rise of atmospheric oxidants in urban areas, resulting in a modest increase in secondary aerosols due to inadequate precursors, which still offset reduced primary emissions. Moreover, the enhanced oxidizing capacity in the surrounding regions greatly increased the secondary particles with relatively abundant precursors, which was transported into Beijing and mainly responsible for the aggravated haze pollution. We recommend that mitigation policies should focus on accelerating VOC emission reduction and synchronously controlling regional sources to release the benefits of local traffic emission control.","Lv, Zhaofeng; Wang, Xiaotong; Deng, Fanyuan; Ying, Qi; Archibald, Alexander T; Jones, Roderic L; Ding, Yan; Cheng, Ying; Fu, Mingliang; Liu, Ying; Man, Hanyang; Xue, Zhigang; He, Kebin; Hao, Jiming; Liu, Huan",Environ. sci. technol,612,14

However, the COVID-19 pandemic brought historic disruptions including widespread visitation restrictions. Here, we characterize in-depth the visitor policies of NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers (CCCs) and analyze geographic/temporal patterns across CCCs. METHODS: The public-facing CCC websites, including archived webpages, were reviewed to abstract initial visitation policies and revisions, including end-of-life (EoL) exceptions and timing of visitation restrictions relative to regional lockdowns. Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were employed to analyze associations between geographic region, timing, and severity of restrictions. RESULTS: Most CCCs (n=43, 86%) enacted visitation restrictions between March 15 and April 15, 2020. About half barred all visitors for COVID-negative inpatients (n=24, 48%) or outpatients (n=26, 52%). Most (n=36, 72%) prohibited visitors for patients with confirmed/suspected COVID-19. Most (n=40, 80%) published EoL exceptions but the specifics were highly variable. The median time from initial restrictions to government-mandated lockdowns was 1 day, with a wide range (25 days before to 26 days after). There was no association between timing of initial restrictions and geographic location (p=0.14) or severity of inpatient policies (p=1.0), even among centers in the same city. Outpatient policies published reactively (after lockdown) were more restrictive than those published proactively (p=0.04). CONCLUSION: CCCs enacted strict but strikingly variable COVID-19 visitation restrictions, with important implications for patients/families seeking cancer care. A unified, evidence-based approach to visitation policies is needed to balance proven infection control measures with the needs of patients and families.","Yeh, Jonathan C; Subbiah, Ishwaria M; Dhawan, Natasha; Thompson, Benjamin W; Hildner, Zachary; Jawed, Areeba; Prommer, Eric; Sinclair, Christian T",Support Care Cancer,612,20

The concept that nucleic acid could modulate the activity of target protein as ligand emerged from basic science studies of viruses. Aptamers are short nucleic acid sequences capable of specific, high-affinity molecular binding, which allow for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Compared to traditional antibodies, aptamers have several advantages, including small size, flexible structure, good biocompatibility, and low immunogenicity. In vitro selection method is used to isolate aptamers that are specific for a desired target from a randomized oligonucleotide library. The first aptamer drug, Macugen, was approved by FDA in 2004, which was accompanied by many studies and clinical investigations on various targets and diseases. Despite much promise, most aptamers have failed to meet the requisite safety and efficacy standards in human clinical trials. Amid these setbacks, the emergence of novel technologies and recent advances in aptamer and systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) design are fueling hope in this field. The unique properties of aptamer are gaining renewed interest in an era of COVID-19. The binding performance of an aptamer and reproducibility are still the key issues in tackling current hurdles in clinical translation. A thorough analysis of the aptamer binding under varying conditions and the conformational dynamics is warranted.

METHODS: We assessed whether proteinuria can be predictive of kidney failure, the development of chronic kidney disease, and mortality in 37 critically ill COVID-19 patients. We used machine learning (ML) methods as decision trees and cut-off points created by the OneR package to add new aspects, even in smaller cohorts. RESULTS: Among a total of 37 patients, 24 suffered higher-grade renal failure, 20 of whom required kidney replacement therapy. More than 40% of patients remained on hemodialysis after intensive care unit discharge or died (27%). Due to frequent anuria proteinuria measured in two-thirds of the patients, it was not predictive for the investigated endpoints; albuminuria was higher in patients with AKI 3, but the difference was not significant. ML found cut-off points of >31.4 kg/m2 for BMI and >69 years for age, constructed decision trees with great accuracy, and identified highly predictive variables for outcome and remaining chronic kidney disease. CONCLUSIONS: Different ML methods and their clinical application, especially decision trees, can provide valuable support for clinical decisions. Presence of proteinuria was not predictive of CKD or AKI and should be confirmed in a larger cohort.","Herzog, Anna Laura; von Jouanne-Diedrich, Holger K; Wanner, Christoph; Weismann, Dirk; Schlesinger, Tobias; Meybohm, Patrick; Stumpner, Jan",PLoS One,612,16

The COVID-19 virus, SARS-CoV-2, affects multiple organ systems, especially the lungs and heart. Elevation of cardiac biomarkers, particularly high-sensitivity troponin and/or creatine kinase MB, is common in patients with COVID-19 infection. In our review of clinical analyses, we found that in 26 studies including 11,685 patients, the weighted pooled prevalence of acute myocardial injury was 20% (ranged from 5% to 38% depending on the criteria used). The plausible mechanisms of myocardial injury include, 1) hyperinflammation and cytokine storm mediated through pathologic T-cells and monocytes leading to myocarditis, 2) respiratory failure and hypoxemia resulting in damage to cardiac myocytes, 3) down regulation of ACE2 expression and subsequent protective signaling pathways in cardiac myocytes, 4) hypercoagulability and development of coronary microvascular thrombosis, 5) diffuse endothelial injury and 'endotheliitis' in several organs including the heart, and, 6) inflammation and/or stress causing coronary plaque rupture or supply-demand mismatch leading to myocardial ischemia/infarction. Cardiac biomarkers can be used to aid in diagnosis as well as risk stratification. In patients with elevated hs-troponin, clinical context is important and myocarditis as well as stress induced cardiomyopathy should be considered in the differential, along with type I and type II myocardial infarction. Irrespective of etiology, patients with acute myocardial injury should be prioritized for treatment. Clinical decisions including interventions should be individualized and carefully tailored after thorough review of risks/benefits. Given the complex interplay of SARS-CoV-2 with the cardiovascular system, further investigation into potential mechanisms is needed to guide effective therapies. Randomized trials are urgently needed to investigate treatment modalities to reduce the incidence and mortality associated with COVID-19 related acute myocardial injury.","Bavishi, Chirag; Bonow, Robert O; Trivedi, Vrinda; Abbott, J Dawn; Messerli, Franz H; Bhatt, Deepak L",Prog Cardiovasc Dis,612,3

Therefore, a focused narrative review was carried out to predict the possible implications of different types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines which confer distinct immune mechanisms to establish immune response and protection against COVID-19: whole virus (inactivated or weakened), viral vector (replicating and non-replicating), nucleic acid (RNA, DNA), and protein-based (protein subunit, virus-like particle). Still, there is uncertainty among patients with AIIDs and clinicians about the effectiveness and safety of the new vaccines. There are a variety of approaches towards building a protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

Remdesivir (GS-5734) is the first approved treatment for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is a novel nucleoside analog with a broad antiviral activity spectrum among RNA viruses, including ebolavirus (EBOV) and the respiratory pathogens Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. First described in 2016, the drug was derived from an antiviral library of small molecules intended to target emerging pathogenic RNA viruses. In vivo, remdesivir showed therapeutic and prophylactic effects in animal models of EBOV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the substance failed in a clinical trial on ebolavirus disease (EVD), where it was inferior to investigational monoclonal antibodies in an interim analysis. As there was no placebo control in this study, no conclusions on its efficacy in EVD can be made. In contrast, data from a placebo-controlled trial show beneficial effects for patients with COVID-19. Remdesivir reduces the time to recovery of hospitalized patients who require supplemental oxygen and may have a positive impact on mortality outcomes while having a favorable safety profile. Although this is an important milestone in the fight against COVID-19, approval of this drug will not be sufficient to solve the public health issues caused by the ongoing pandemic. Further scientific efforts are needed to evaluate the full potential of nucleoside analogs as treatment or prophylaxis of viral respiratory infections and to develop effective antivirals that are orally bioavailable.","Malin, Jakob J; Suárez, Isabelle; Priesner, Vanessa; Fätkenheuer, Gerd; Rybniker, Jan",Clin. microbiol. rev,612,1

Although evidence suggests that children generally display mild symptoms, the size of the school-age population means the total impact of reopening schools is unclear. Here, we present work from mid-May 2020 that focused on the imminent opening of schools and consider what these results imply for future policy. We compared eight strategies for reopening primary and secondary schools in England. Modifying a transmission model fitted to UK SARS-CoV-2 data, we assessed how reopening schools affects contact patterns, anticipated secondary infections and the relative change in the reproduction number, R. We determined the associated public health impact and its sensitivity to changes in social distancing within the wider community. We predicted that reopening schools with half-sized classes or focused on younger children was unlikely to push R above one. Older children generally have more social contacts, so reopening secondary schools results in more cases than reopening primary schools, while reopening both could have pushed R above one in some regions. Reductions in community social distancing were found to outweigh and exacerbate any impacts of reopening. In particular, opening schools when the reproduction number R is already above one generates the largest increase in cases. Our work indicates that while any school reopening will result in increased mixing and infection amongst children and the wider population, reopening schools alone in June 2020 was unlikely to push R above one. Ultimately, reopening decisions are a difficult trade-off between epidemiological consequences and the emotional, educational and developmental needs of children. Into the future, there are difficult questions about what controls can be instigated such that schools can remain open if cases increase.

We aim to assess the incidence of AKI among patients with COVID-19 and examine their associations with patient outcomes as reported in the available literature thus far. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and MedRxiv databases for full-text articles available in English published from December 1, 2019 to May 24, 2020. Clinical information was extracted and examined from 20 cohorts that met inclusion criteria, covering 13,137 mostly hospitalized patients confirmed to have COVID-19. Two authors independently extracted study characteristics, results, outcomes, study-level risk of bias, and strength of evidence across studies. Neither reviewer was blind to journal titles, study authors, or institutions. Results: Median age was 56 years, with 55% male patients. Approximately 43% of patients had severe COVID-19 infection, and approximately 11% died. Prevalence of AKI was 17%; 77% of patients with AKI experienced severe COVID-19 infection, and 52% died.

In the gastroenterostomy, the incidence of the same proliferating lesion was 43.75% in the DGR54 and 85.71% in DGR36 (p 0,05). The incidence of squamous hyperplasia was 62.5% in DGR54 and 14.2% in DGR36 (p 0.001). In the sham group, not one proliferating lesion was diagnosed. Areas of adenomatous hyperplasia were histologically measured in both groups (DGR54 and DGR36) by digital analysis system. In the pyloric mucosa the median of the areas was 8.583mm² in DGR54 and 0.2690mm² in DGR36 (p 0.001). In the gastroenterostomy the median was zero in DGR54 and 0.5295mm² in DGR36 (p > 0.50). Conclusions: The DGR through the pylorus promoted mainly benign proliferating lesions. The interruption of the DGR resulted in impaired growing of the area of adenomatous hyperplasia in pyloric mucosa and decreased the incidence of the squamous hyperplasia. At the gastroenterostomy site, the surgical procedure favored the maintenance of the proliferating process, even after DGR interruption.","Antonio Rodrigues, Paulo; Eduardo Naresse, Luiz; Vieira Souza Leite, Celso; Aparecida Marchesan Rodrigues, Maria; Kobayasi, Shoiti",Acta cir. bras.,612,25

Using a multivariate hidden Markov model (HMM) and Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) the algorithm adaptively adjusts to shifts in distribution over time. The proposed algorithm is unsupervised and learns to label events without requiring $\textit{a priori}$ information about true event states. The procedure is illustrated on experimental data collected from a cohort in a human viral challenge (HVC) study, where certain subjects have disrupted wake and sleep patterns after exposure to a H1N1 influenza pathogen. $\textbf{Results}$: Simulations establish that the proposed adaptive algorithm significantly outperforms other event classification methods. When applied to early time points in the HVC data the algorithm extracts sleep/wake features that are predictive of both infection and infection onset time. $\textbf{Conclusion}$: The proposed transfer learning event segmentation method is robust to temporal shifts in data distribution and can be used to produce highly discriminative event-labeled features for health monitoring. $\textbf{Significance}$: Our integrated multisensor signal processing and transfer learning method is applicable to many ambulatory monitoring applications.","She, Xichen; Zhai, Yaya; Henao, Ricardo; Woods, Christopher W.; Chiu, Christopher; Ginsburg, Geoffrey S.; Song, Peter X.K.; Hero, Alfred O.",,612,24

Several governments around the world have adopted emergency actions to reduce spreading of the virus, which included suspension of non-essential activities and the implementation of social distancing practices. In our case, governmental measures have resulted in the suspension of our experimental protocol for testing the effectiveness of robot-based treatment of children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) compared to conventional human (therapist)-based treatment. These circumstances led to an investigation of the potential of tele-consulting. This paper describes alternatives to implement synchronous and asynchronous therapeutic sessions for children already participating in the protocol, in order to reduce the negative effects of the strict cessation of the in-person sessions. The usefulness of our approach was assessed by recording the children's and the parent's satisfaction via questionnaires. In addition, we compare satisfaction between the synchronous and asynchronous sessions. The results show that the approach has been very satisfactory and useful for both children and parents, and that this was especially the case for the robot-based material.","Lytridis, Chris; Bazinas, Christos; Sidiropoulos, George; Papakostas, George A.; Kaburlasos, Vassilis G.; Nikopoulou, Vasiliki-Aliki; Holeva, Vasiliki; Evangeliou, Athanasios",Electron.,612,1

We compared the sleep habits, depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9: PHQ-9), insomnia (Athens Insomnia Scale: AIS), and sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale: ESS) of patients during the period from April to July 2019 vs. May 2020 (a period of self-isolation due to COVID-19). A Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated no significant differences in PHQ-9, ESS, and AIS scores between 2019 and 2020 within both the strong self-isolation group and no/little self-isolation group. With respect to sleep habits, earlier bedtime (p = 0.006) and increased sleep duration (p = 0.014) were found in the strong self-isolation group. The former (p = 0.009) was also found in the no/little self-isolation group, but we found significant differences in sleep duration between the no/little self-isolation group and the strong self-isolation group (p = 0.047). Therefore, self-isolation due to COVID-19 had relatively small one-year effects on depression, sleepiness, and insomnia in a clinical population.","Ubara, Ayaka; Sumi, Yukiyoshi; Ito, Kazuki; Matsuda, Arichika; Matsuo, Masahiro; Miyamoto, Towa; Kadotani, Hiroshi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),612,22

As both pregnant and paediatric patients are likely to be excluded from most planned investigations, the list of repurposed options and the available data on these drugs and vaccines provide a baseline risk assessment and identify gaps for targeted investigation. METHODS: Clinical trials have been searched and reviewed; 23 repurposed drugs and drug combinations and nine candidate vaccines have been assessed regarding the availability of relevant data in paediatrics and pregnant women and to evaluate expected or unanticipated risk. RESULTS: Thirteen of the repurposed drugs or drug combinations are indicated for use in paediatrics in some age category albeit for indications other than COVID-19; 10 of these are indicated for use in pregnant women. Even in cases where these drugs are indicated in the populations, source data from which safety and or dosing could be extrapolated for use in COVID-19 is sparse. Vaccine trials are ongoing and generally exclude pregnant women; only in a few instances have paediatric subgroups been planned for enrolment. Data from individual case studies and RWD may suggest that subpopulations of both paediatric patients and pregnant women may be more at risk, particularly those in an increased inflammatory state. CONCLUSION: In conjunction with more prospective collaboration, plans are evolving to ensure that we will be better prepared to address similar situations especially in paediatrics and pregnant women where experience is limited and actual practice relies heavily on leveraging data from other populations and indications.","Barrett, Jeffrey S",,612,5

Previous epidemics of many emerging viral infections have typically resulted in poor obstetrical outcomes including maternal morbidity and mortality, maternal-fetal transmission of the virus, and perinatal infections and death. This communication reviews the effects of two previous coronavirus infections - severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV - on pregnancy outcomes. In addition, it analyzes literature describing 38 pregnant women with COVID-19 and their newborns in China to assess the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the mothers and infants including clinical, laboratory and virologic data, and the transmissibility of the virus from mother to fetus. This analysis reveals that unlike coronavirus infections of pregnant women caused by SARS and MERS, in these 38 pregnant women COVID-19 did not lead to maternal deaths. Importantly, and similar to pregnancies with SARS and MERS, there were no confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mothers with COVID-19 to their fetuses. All neonatal specimens tested, including in some cases placentas, were negative by rt-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. At this point in the global pandemic of COVID-19 infection there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes intrauterine or transplacental transmission from infected pregnant women to their fetuses.

Delivery times for additional intensive care respirators are currently not foreseeable. An option to increase ventilation capacities not only for COVID-19, but for all patients requiring mechanical ventilation is to use home respirators. Home respirators are turbine respirators, so they can usually be operated without high-pressure oxygen connections and can therefore also be used in areas outside the classical intensive care medical infrastructure. Due to their limited technical features, home respirators are not suitable for the treatment of severely affected patients but can be used for weaning after respiratory improvement, which means that intensive care respirators are available again more quickly. Respiratory therapists are specially trained nurses or therapists in the field of out of hospital ventilation and can independently use home ventilation respirators, for example for weaning in the intensive care unit. Thus, they relieve intensive care nursing staff in the pandemic. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic medical students from the Oldenburg University are currently being trained in operating home respirators to provide basic support in the hospital if necessary.","Summ, O; Schute, J; Byhahn, C; Kahle, T; Herrmann, M; Schulte, C; Bergold, M N; Groß, M",Anaesthesist,612,26

As such, there is a public health interest in social distancing compliance. The available evidence on distancing practices in public space is limited, however, by the lack of observational data. Here, we apply video observation as a method to examine to what extent members of the public comply with social distancing directives. DATA: Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage of interactions in public was collected in inner-city Amsterdam, the Netherlands. From the footage, we observed instances of people violating the 1.5-meter distance directives in the weeks before, during, and after these directives were introduced to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: We find that people complied with the 1.5-meter distance directives when these directives were first introduced, but that the level of compliance started to decline soon after. We also find that violation of the 1.5-meter distance directives is strongly associated with the number of people observed on the street and with non-compliance to stay-at-home directives, operationalized with large-scale aggregated location data from cell phones. All three measures correlate to a varying extent with temporal patterns in the transmission of the COVID-19 virus, temperature, COVID-19 related Google search queries, and media attention to the topic. CONCLUSION: Compliance with 1.5 meter distance directives is short-lived and coincides with the number of people on the street and with compliance to stay-at-home directives. Potential implications of these findings are that keep- distance directives may work best in combination with stay-at-home directives and place-specific crowd-control strategies, and that the number of people on the street and community-wide mobility as captured with cell phone data offer easily measurable proxies for the extent to which people keep sufficient physical distance from others at specific times and locations.","Hoeben, Evelien M; Bernasco, Wim; Suonperä Liebst, Lasse; van Baak, Carlijn; Rosenkrantz Lindegaard, Marie",PLoS One,612,20

A major virulence factor of SARS-CoVs is the nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1), which suppresses host gene expression by ribosome association. Here, we show that Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2 binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit, resulting in shutdown of messenger RNA (mRNA) translation both in vitro and in cells. Structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy of in vitro-reconstituted Nsp1-40S and various native Nsp1-40S and -80S complexes revealed that the Nsp1 C terminus binds to and obstructs the mRNA entry tunnel. Thereby, Nsp1 effectively blocks retinoic acid-inducible gene I-dependent innate immune responses that would otherwise facilitate clearance of the infection. Thus, the structural characterization of the inhibitory mechanism of Nsp1 may aid structure-based drug design against SARS-CoV-2.","Thoms, Matthias; Buschauer, Robert; Ameismeier, Michael; Koepke, Lennart; Denk, Timo; Hirschenberger, Maximilian; Kratzat, Hanna; Hayn, Manuel; Mackens-Kiani, Timur; Cheng, Jingdong; Straub, Jan H; Stürzel, Christina M; Fröhlich, Thomas; Berninghausen, Otto; Becker, Thomas; Kirchhoff, Frank; Sparrer, Konstantin M J; Beckmann, Roland",Science,612,1

Crucial interference with their everyday lives likely increased psychological distress while accessibility of conventional mental health care was limited. Ongoing online trials offer a unique opportunity to analyse mental health status and help-seeking behaviour of adolescents during the pandemic. The ProHEAD-online trial aims at improving help-seeking behaviour of children and adolescents with significant psychological impairment. From January to May 2020, 1,042 students had access to the ProHEAD-online platform providing information on mental illness, monitoring, peer support and professional counselling. In the week from 11 March, when schools were closed in Germany, a drastic (more than 2 standard deviations) but time-limited increase in utilization of the ProHEAD-online services became apparent. This may indicate a worsened mental health status and an increased help seeking via digital services during the lockdown. Although this finding is purely observational, it speaks to the importance of evidence-based online service in the field of mental health within the current crisis and beyond.","Kaess, Michael; Moessner, Markus; Koenig, Julian; Lustig, Sophia; Bonnet, Sabrina; Becker, Katja; Eschenbeck, Heike; Rummel-Kluge, Christine; Thomasius, Rainer; Bauer, Stephanie",J. child psychol. psychiatry allied discipl,612,24

Decision-makers considering whether to allow such trials, we argue, must ultimately consider the likelihood that consent to participation in such trials under current conditions would be valid, and whether this likelihood is high enough to permit such trials.

This study aims to evaluate the effects of steroids on clinical recovery, duration of hospitalization, and time needed for the cessation of oxygen treatment. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March and May 2020. Patient age, laboratory parameters, clinical stages, radiologic scores, length of hospital stay, and time needed for the cessation of oxygen supplementation were compared. Results: Thirteen patients were treated with steroids, and 12 controls were included in the analysis. Regarding the laboratory parameters, the groups were similar except for lymphocyte percentage (9.8 +/- 3.2, 7.0 +/- 2.9;p=0.033), which was higher, and 1)-dieter levels (0.75 (0.60-1.43), 157 (0.91-2.29);p-0.047), which were lower in the steroid group on admission. Steroid treatment provided a tendency of decrease in time to cessation of oxygen supplementation (6.23 +/- 3A vs 7.67 +/- 2.1, p=0.217).

The aim of the study was to describe the use of health care in a representative sample of the Swiss population during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in 2020, and to compare it to data from a survey conducted in 2018. METHODS: We conducted an observational, population-based, nationwide, repeated cross-sectional survey of the adult Swiss general population in 2018 and in March and April 2020 during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Recruitment and data acquisition was conducted by the Link Institute in Lucerne in representative samples of Swiss citizens in 2020 and in 2018. Variables of interest were estimates of health problems, health seeking behaviour, medication and health care use in the population. RESULTS: In total, we included data of 1980 individuals (in 2018 N = 958 and in 2020 N = 1022). Across both rounds of data collection the median age was 46 years (range = 18-79 years) and 50% were women. Per 1000 adults, half had at least one symptom and a quarter sought medical advice across both surveys. The most frequently consulted health providers in 2020 were general practitioners (GP) (180/1000), specialist physicians (41/1000), pharmacies (38/1000), the internet (26/1000) and accident and emergency units (25/1000). Compared to 2018, we noted a significant increase in the use of health providers during the pandemic, which was independent of demographic variables for the following health care providers: use of internet (OR = 9.8), pharmacy (OR = 2.64), accident and emergency units (OR = 2.54), and a significant decrease in the number of people who consulted specialist physicians (OR = 0.46). Overall, 76/1000 contacted their GP in relation to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to 2018, GPs remained the most important source of medical advice for the population during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland. While the self-appraisal of health problems and of the need for medical advice remained constant, individuals seemed to change their provider choice during the pandemic, with an increased utilisation of accident and emergency units and pharmacies, which represent easily accessible and low-threshold medical services.","Giezendanner, Stéphanie; Fischer, Roland; Diaz Hernandez, Laura; Zeller, Andreas",BMC Public Health,612,21

To address this issue, we performed a cross-sectional study of 246 individuals to determine whether autoantibodies targeting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-related molecules were associated with COVID-19-related clinical outcomes. Moderate and severe patients exhibited the highest autoantibody levels, relative to both healthy controls and patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms. Random Forest, a machine learning model, ranked anti-GPCR autoantibodies targeting downstream molecules in the RAS signaling pathway such as the angiotensin II type 1 and Mas receptor, and the chemokine receptor CXCR3 as the three strongest predictors of severe disease. Moreover, while the autoantibody network signatures were relatively conserved in patients with mild COVID-19 compared to healthy controls, they were disrupted in moderate and most perturbed in severe patients. Our data indicate that the relationship between autoantibodies targeting GPCRs and RAS-related molecules associates with the clinical severity of COVID-19, suggesting novel molecular pathways for therapeutic interventions.","Marques, Otavio Cabral; Halpert, Gilad; Schimke, Lena F; Ostrinski, Yuri; Zyskind, Israel; Lattin, Miriam T; Tran, Florian; Schreiber, Stefan; Marques, Alexandre H.C.; Filgueiras, Igor Salerno; Placa, Desiree Rodrigues; Baiocchi, Gabriela Crispim; Freire, Paula P; Fonseca, Dennyson Leandro M.; Humrich, Jens Y.; Lange, Tanja; Muller, Antje; Giil, Lasse M.; Grasshoff, Hanna; Schumann, Anja; Hackel, Alexander Maximilian; Junker, Juliane; Meyer, Carlotta; Ochs, Hans D.; Lavi, Yael Bublil; Schulze-Forster, Kai; Silvergerg, Jonathan I.; Amital, Howard; Zimmerman, Jason; Heidecke, Harry; Rosenberg, Avi Z; Riemekasten, Gabriela; Shoenfeld, Yehuda",,612,10

METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of Emergency Medicine (EM) physicians working at a Level 1 Trauma Center who chose to use self-supplied EFMs for PPE. All subjects used commercial EFMs with disposable filters (N95, P95, or P100). All subjects chose their mask size independently with no input from employee health regarding appropriate fit. Per study protocol, subjects were fit tested periodically during clinical shifts over the course of the 6-week study period. All investigators performing fit testing underwent OSHA qualitative fit testing training. Data collected included mask/filters age, subjective assessment of mask seal quality, and fit test results. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: 105 fit tests were performed on physicians wearing EFMs over the course of 49 shifts. Physicians felt their fit was adequate for all tests performed. There were no fit test failures in any subjects. CONCLUSIONS: EFMs have an extremely low failure rate. Physicians are able to assess the adequacy of fit and accurately choose EFM size.","McMahon, Kathleen; Jeanmonod, Donald; Check, Ronald; Rivard, Leah; Balakrishnan, Vamsi; Kelly, Brian; Pester, Jonathan; Jeanmonod, Rebecca",Am J Emerg Med,612,33

Conversely, government interventions to reduce the spread of the disease and the number of fatalities may induce a bifurcation that stabilizes a desirable state with low numbers of COVID-19 cases and associated deaths. The key characteristic feature of an infection dynamical system in this context is the eigenvalue that determines the stability of the states under consideration and is known in synergetics as the order parameter eigenvalue. Using a SEIR-like infection disease model, the relevant order parameter and its eigenvalue are determined. A three stage methodology is proposed to track and estimate the eigenvalue through time. The method is applied to COVID-19 infection data reported from 20 European countries during the period of January 1, 2020 to June 15. It is shown that in 15 out of the 20 countries the eigenvalue switched its sign suggesting that during the reporting period an intervention bifurcation took place that stabilized the desirable low death state. It is shown that the eigenvalue analysis also allows for a ranking of countries by the degree of the stability of the infection-free state. For the investigated countries, Ireland was found to exhibit the most stable infection-free state. Finally, a six point classification scheme is suggested with groups 5 and 6 including countries that failed to stabilize the desirable infection-free low death state. In doing so, tools for assessing the effectiveness of government interventions are provided that are at the heart of bifurcation theory, in general, and synergetics, in particular.","Frank, T.

We validated the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended SARS-CoV-2 assay and analyzed the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 and CARVs. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs (NOPS) from 7663 patients were prospectively tested by the Basel S-gene and WHO-based E-gene (Roche) assays in parallel using the Basel N-gene assay for confirmation. CARVs were prospectively tested in 2394 NOPS by multiplex nucleic acid testing, including 1816 (75%) simultaneously for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The Basel S-gene and Roche E-gene assays were concordant in 7475 cases (97.5%) including 825 (11%) SARS-CoV-2 positives. In 188 (2.5%) discordant cases, SARS-CoV-2 loads were significantly lower than in concordant positive ones and confirmed in 105 (1.4%). Adults were more frequently SARS-CoV-2 positive, whereas children tested more frequently CARV positive. CARV coinfections with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 1.8%. SARS-CoV-2 replaced CARVs within 3 weeks, reaching 48% of all detected respiratory viruses followed by rhinovirus/enterovirus (13%), influenza virus (12%), coronavirus (9%), respiratory syncytial virus (6%), and metapneumovirus (6%). CONCLUSIONS: Winter CARVs were dominant during the early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, impacting infection control and treatment decisions, but were rapidly replaced, suggesting competitive infection. We hypothesize that preexisting immune memory and innate immune interference contribute to the different SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology among adults and children.","Leuzinger, Karoline; Roloff, Tim; Gosert, Rainer; Sogaard, Kirstin; Naegele, Klaudia; Rentsch, Katharina; Bingisser, Roland; Nickel, Christian H; Pargger, Hans; Bassetti, Stefano; Bielicki, Julia; Khanna, Nina; Tschudin Sutter, Sarah; Widmer, Andreas; Hinic, Vladimira; Battegay, Manuel; Egli, Adrian; Hirsch, Hans H",J Infect Dis,612,5

The aim of our work was to better understand the impact of misclassification errors in identification of true cases of COVID-19 on epidemic curves. Data originated from Alberta, Canada (available on 28 May 2020). There is presently no information of sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp) of laboratory tests used in Canada for the causal agent for COVID-19. Therefore, we examined best attainable performance in other jurisdictions and similar viruses. This suggested perfect Sp and Sn 60-95%. We used these values to re-calculate epidemic curves to visualize the potential bias due to imperfect testing. If the sensitivity improved, the observed and adjusted epidemic curves likely fall within 95% confidence intervals of the observed counts. However, bias in shape and peak of the epidemic curves can be pronounced, if sensitivity either degrades or remains poor in the 60-70% range. These issues are minor early in the epidemic, but hundreds of undiagnosed cases are likely later on.

Large-scale food fortification strategies hold great promise for reducing micronutrient deficiencies; however, for children <2 y of age, the impact of such strategies is limited because their intake of staple foods is relatively low and fortification levels are targeted at the adult population. Iron supplementation, iron fortification of foods targeted to infants, and point-of-use fortification with iron-containing products such as multiple micronutrient powders (MNPs) and small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements are evidence-based approaches recommended to reduce anemia among infants and young children when used in the right context. Since 2003, the WHO, with support from UNICEF, has recommended the use of MNPs to control iron deficiency. However, the percentage of children with anemia has changed very little over the past 10 y. Five years ago the UN declared a decade of action on nutrition, including World Health Assembly (WHA) targets for maternal, infant, and young child nutrition, yet the WHA set no anemia targets for children. In July 2020 the leaders of 4 UN agencies issued a call for action to protect children's right to nutrition in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. Given persistently high rates of anemia among young children, the negative developmental impact, the challenge of meeting iron needs from typical complementary food diets, and the availability of successful evidence-based fortification strategies for this age group, we encourage planners, speakers, and donors at this year's UN Food Systems Summit and the Tokyo Nutrition for Growth Summit to 1) call for the WHA to set anemia targets for infants and young children and 2) promote investment in evidence-based interventions to improve the iron status of young children.","Zlotkin, Stanley; Dewey, Kathryn G",Am. j. clin. nutr,612,26

OBJECTIVE: To describe an approach to stratifying nursing homes according to risk for COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Population-based cross-sectional study of all accredited nursing homes in Victoria (n=766), accommodating 48,824 permanent residents. We examined each home's facility structure, governance history, socio-economic status, proximity to high-risk industry, and proximity and size of local acute public hospital, stratified by location, size and organizational structure. RESULTS: Privately owned nursing homes tend to be larger and metropolitan-based, and publicly owned homes regionally based and smaller in size. The details reveal additional nuance, e.g. privately owned metropolitan-based medium-to-large-sized facilities tended to have more regulatory non-compliance, no board of governance, and fewer Chief Executive Officers with clinical background. In contrast, the smaller, publicly owned, remote facilities perform better on those same metrics. CONCLUSION: Nursing homes should not be regarded as generic entities, and there is significant underlying heterogeneity. Stratification of nursing homes according to risk level is a viable approach to informing more nuanced policy direction and resource allocation for emergency management responses.","Ibrahim, Joseph E; Li, Yingtong; Brown, Charlotte; McKee, Grace; Eren, Hagar; Pham, Tony",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,612,15

Animals are more likely to survive in a changing environment by adjusting their behaviour to repeatedly occurring but harmless stimulations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, starting in late 2019, face masks were recommended to the public to prevent the spread of pathogens. In this context, we compared the flight initiation distance (FID) of the Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus), a commonly seen bird across China, in Yibin and Dazhou, Sichuan, in response to people with or without face masks. After continuous exposure to people wearing face masks for nearly six months, sparrows evidently became adapted to people wearing face masks, and correspondingly showed shorter FIDs in response to people wearing masks. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that birds show reduced fear responses to people wearing face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results suggest a novel aspect of short-term adaptation of wildlife to human behaviour, and that the learning ability of sparrows allows them to adjust their behaviours to adapt to such subtle changes in the environment.","Jiang, Xingyi; Liu, Jianping; Zhang, Changjie; Liang, Wei",Glob Ecol Conserv,612,14

Early diagnosis is crucial for correct treatment in order to possibly reduce the stress in the healthcare system. The standard image diagnosis tests for pneumonia are chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scan. Although CT scan is the gold standard, CXR are still useful because it is cheaper, faster and more widespread. This study aims to identify pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from other types and also healthy lungs using only CXR images. METHODS: In order to achieve the objectives, we have proposed a classification schema considering the following perspectives: i) a multi-class classification; ii) hierarchical classification, since pneumonia can be structured as a hierarchy. Given the natural data imbalance in this domain, we also proposed the use of resampling algorithms in the schema in order to re-balance the classes distribution. We observed that, texture is one of the main visual attributes of CXR images, our classification schema extract features using some well-known texture descriptors and also using a pre-trained CNN model. We also explored early and late fusion techniques in the schema in order to leverage the strength of multiple texture descriptors and base classifiers at once. To evaluate the approach, we composed a database, named RYDLS-20, containing CXR images of pneumonia caused by different pathogens as well as CXR images of healthy lungs. The classes distribution follows a real-world scenario in which some pathogens are more common than others. RESULTS: The proposed approach tested in RYDLS-20 achieved a macro-avg F1-Score of 0.65 using a multi-class approach and a F1-Score of 0.89 for the COVID-19 identification in the hierarchical classification scenario. CONCLUSIONS: As far as we know, the top identification rate obtained in this paper is the best nominal rate obtained for COVID-19 identification in an unbalanced environment with more than three classes. We must also highlight the novel proposed hierarchical classification approach for this task, which considers the types of pneumonia caused by the different pathogens and lead us to the best COVID-19 recognition rate obtained here.","Pereira, Rodolfo M; Bertolini, Diego; Teixeira, Lucas O; Silla, Carlos N; Costa, Yandre M G",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,612,29

METHODS: We examined the clinical features and outcomes of 190 patients treated with ECMO within 14 days of ICU admission, using data from a multicenter cohort study of 5122 critically ill adults with COVID-19 admitted to 68 hospitals across the United States. To estimate the effect of ECMO on mortality, we emulated a target trial of ECMO receipt versus no ECMO receipt within 7 days of ICU admission among mechanically ventilated patients with severe hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 < 100). Patients were followed until hospital discharge, death, or a minimum of 60 days. We adjusted for confounding using a multivariable Cox model. RESULTS: Among the 190 patients treated with ECMO, the median age was 49 years (IQR 41-58), 137 (72.1%) were men, and the median PaO2/FiO2 prior to ECMO initiation was 72 (IQR 61-90). At 60 days, 63 patients (33.2%) had died, 94 (49.5%) were discharged, and 33 (17.4%) remained hospitalized. Among the 1297 patients eligible for the target trial emulation, 45 of the 130 (34.6%) who received ECMO died, and 553 of the 1167 (47.4%) who did not receive ECMO died. In the primary analysis, patients who received ECMO had lower mortality than those who did not (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.41-0.74). Results were similar in a secondary analysis limited to patients with PaO2/FiO2 < 80 (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.40-0.77).

Serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 have been widely used for serosurveys, epidemiology, and identification of potential convalescent plasma donors. However, the clinical role of serologic testing is still limited and evolving. In this report, we describe the experience of selecting, validating, and implementing SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing for clinical purposes at an academic medical center in a rural state. Successful implementation involved close collaboration between pathology, infectious diseases, and outpatient clinics. The most common clinician concerns were appropriateness/utility of testing, patient charges/insurance coverage, and assay specificity. In analyzing test utilization, serologic testing in the first month after go-live was almost entirely outpatient and appeared to be strongly driven by patient interest (including health care workers and others in high-risk occupations for exposure to SARS-CoV-2), with little evidence that the results impacted clinical decision-making. Test volumes for serology declined steadily through October 31, 2020, with inpatient ordering assuming a steadily higher percentage of the total. In a 5-month period, SARS-CoV-2 serology test volumes amounted to only 1.3% of that of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Unlike reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, supply chain challenges and reagent availability were not major issues for serology testing. We also discuss the most recent challenge of requirements for SARS-CoV-2 testing in international travel protocols. Overall, our experience at an academic medical center shows that SARS-CoV-2 serology testing assumed a limited clinical role.","Humble, R. M.; Merrill, A. E.; Ford, B. A.; Diekema, D.

The need for specific treatments to adequately stop the inflammatory response and its sequelae is day by day more urgent and many therapeutic strategies were performed since COVID-19 burst in the last months. Statins were thought to be effective against this novel coronavirus for their anti-inflammatory properties, even if the real effects on COVID patients are still partially unexplored. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 501 adult patients, consecutively admitted to the two COVID-hospitals of Ferrara's territory, and divided them into two groups: ST = patients on statin therapy on admission and NST=patients not on statin therapy on admission. We searched for differences between groups in terms of anamnestic, clinical and laboratory data and then in terms of COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: We found significant differences between groups in terms of age, comorbidities, procalcitonin and CPK serum levels: ST patients were older, more comorbid, with lower procalcitonin and higher CPK serum levels. Male sex was, together with the Charlson Comorbidity Index, an independent predictor of needing intensification of care, while age only was a good predictor of in-hospital and 100-day mortality. Differences were also found in the survival functions between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: After a period of observation of 100 days, ST patients, despite their older age and their greater load of comorbidities, have similar survival functions to NST patients. If adjusted for age and CCI the survival functions of ST group are considerably more favourable than those of the second group.","Greco, Salvatore; D039,; Amuri, Andrea; Giorgini, Enrico; Luciani, Francesco; Lopreiato, Mariarosaria; Fortunato, Valeria; Scopa, Alessandro; Vestita, Grazia; Capatti, Eleonora; Passaro, Angelina",High Blood Press Cardiovasc Prev,612,30

As it happens, such a statement would apply perfectly well to the story of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the COVID-19 infection: it has become a veritable saga, with conflicting views that have often gone beyond the normal scientific dialectic, and with conclusions that have frequently been polluted by non scientific opinions: thus, for instance, when National Agencies have taken positions against CQ and HCQ, the move has been seen as a pro-vaccine attempt to block low cost therapy means. And it is difficult to avoid the feeling that the opposition to CQ and HCQ has in large measure been shaped not by scientific arguments, but by the fact that their use has been strongly endorsed by National leaders whose popularity among Western intellectuals is extremely low. The role of the two drugs in the COVID-19 infection thus deserves an objective analysis solely based on scientific facts.

By November 30, 2020, when this paper was written, 13.5 million cases were reported in the U.S. with over 268 000 deaths. Historically, vaccines have been one of the most effective and efficient technical tools for controlling a communicable disease. While the development of these vaccines has certainly been a challenge, it could be more challenging to achieve robust vaccine uptake because of many barriers. In this review, we focused on two types of barriers documented from long-term experience in the U.S.: structural and attitudinal. Structural barriers are systemic issues that impact one's ability to access a service, and they include time, transportation, cost, and clinic or outlet location; while attitudinal barriers are beliefs or perceptions that impact the willingness of at-risk individuals to seek out and/or accept a service. In the context of vaccination they include beliefs about the communicable disease, beliefs about vaccines, fear, and trust in healthcare and governmental agencies. Of the attitudinal barriers, public trust is a barrier that is of particular importance. In addition to affecting reception of vaccines, it may exacerbate disparities and reduce the likelihood of success of a vaccination program. Recommendations are made to overcome attitudinal barriers to help improve the effectiveness of vaccination programs for COVID-19 control in the U.S., such as building public support through bipartisan endorsements and leveraging social media platforms to promote vaccination.","Fisk, Rebecca J",,612,26

The aim of this study was to assess the early impact of nationwide school closure (March-May 2020) and social distancing for COVID-19 on the number of inpatients with major childhood infectious diseases in Japan. Using data from the Diagnosis Procedure Combination system in Japan, we identified patients aged 15 years or younger with admissions for a diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), influenza, gastrointestinal infection (GII), appendicitis, urinary tract infection (UTI), or skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) between July 2018 and June 2020. Changes in the trend of the weekly number of inpatients between the two periods were assessed using interrupted time-series analysis. A total of 75,053 patients in 210 hospitals were included. The overall weekly number of inpatients was decreased by 52.5%, 77.4%, and by 83.4% in the last week of March, April, and May 2020, respectively, when compared on a year-on-year basis. The estimated impact was a reduction of 581 (standard error 42.9) inpatients per week in the post-school-closure period (p < 0.001). The main part of the reduction was for pre-school children. Remarkable decreases in the number of inpatients with URI, LRTI, and GII were observed, while there were relatively mild changes in the other groups.Conclusion: We confirmed a marked reduction in the number of inpatients with childhood non-COVID-19 acute infections in the post-school-closure period. What is Known: â¢ Most countries have implemented social distancing measures to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). â¢ A large decrease in pediatric emergency visits has been reported from several countries after the social distancing. What is New: â¢ Based on administrative claims data, a marked reduction in the number of inpatients for childhood non-COVID-19 acute infections was found in the post-school-closure period in Japan. â¢ The magnitude of the reduction was different between the disease groups.","Kishimoto, Kenji; Bun, Seiko; Shin, Jung-Ho; Takada, Daisuke; Morishita, Tetsuji; Kunisawa, Susumu; Imanaka, Yuichi",Eur. j. pediatr,612,23

Diabetes mellitus is co-morbidity which is considered as the risk factor for COVID 19. Well-controlled diabetes is associated with better outcomes than poorly controlled diabetes. Measurement of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is the standard method for assessing long term glycaemic control. Regardless of the level of hyperglycaemia, improvement in glycaemic control will lower the risk of diabetic complications. Aim: This study was conducted to identify the role of glycaemic control (HbA1c) in predicting the severity of illness in patients with COVID 19 pneumonia. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective observational study of (51 diabetic and 51 were non diabetic) patients at Kamineni Academy of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, India. The patients diagnosed with COVID 19 pneumonia, which includes both diabetics and non diabetics from June 2020 to September 2020. Patients age, sex, baseline HbA1c levels, and oxygen requirement during the hospital stay were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 22.0. The Chi-Square test was used to analyse qualitative data and p-value significant at level &lt;0.05. Results: In the study among diabetics (n=51), 20 (39.2%) were on room air, 24 (47.1%) required intermittent oxygen support, 3 (5.9%) high flow oxygen, and 4 (7.8%) non invasive ventilator support. Among non diabetics (n=51), 28 (54.9%) were on room air, 18 (35.3%) on intermittent oxygen, 2 (3.9%) high flow oxygen, and 3 (5.9%) Non Invasive Ventilator (NIV) support. It was observed that patients with HbA1c measurements with poor glycaemic control required more oxygen support during treatment in diabetics (p-value:0.469) Conclusion: In the present study, patients with poor glycaemic control required insignificantly, more oxygen support than patients with good glycaemic control.","Kishan, J.

Levels of sense of smell perception were determined when the participants detected, recognized, or identified all (normosmia), 1-3 (hyposmia), or none (anosmia) of the odorants. Associated factors of olfactory dysfunction were identified by multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 95%CI). RECENT FINDINGS: Olfactory dysfunction is a prevalent disorder affecting up to 20% of the general population. In addition to viral infection, including COVID-19, a number of other causes and factors may also be involved. 1,956 surveys were conducted and 1,921 were analyzed. Most of the participants (62.1%) were women. The general prevalence of olfactory dysfunction, regarding detection, was 7.2% (7.1% hyposmia, 0.1% anosmia). Age-related olfactory deterioration was observed in both sexes from the 5th decade of life (OR 2.74, p = 0.0050). Women showed better olfactory identification (OR 0.73, p = 0.0010). Obesity (OR 1.97, p = 0.0070), low educational level, bad/very bad self-perceived olfactory function (OR 2.74, p = 0.0050), olfactory loss for less than one week (OR 1.35, p = 0.0030), exposure to toxics/irritants (OR 1.31, p = 0.0030), active smoking (OR 1.58, p < 0.0010), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (OR 2.68, 95%CI 1.74-4.10, p < 0.0001) were identified as factors associated with olfactory dysfunction. These results in a Mexican population suggest better olfactory identification (verbalization) in females. Age was a determining factor in the olfactory deterioration process and obesity and diabetes mellitus were also associated with olfactory disorders. Finally, these findings reinforce the differential diagnosis with other potential causes of sense of smell loss, during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Castillo-López, Irma Yolanda; Govea-Camacho, Luis Humberto; Rodríguez-Torres, Iván Alejandro; Recio-Macías, Denisse Alejandra; Alobid, Isam; Mullol, Joaquim",Curr Allergy Asthma Rep,612,1

It is not a durable circulation and many Fontan patients eventually present for advanced heart failure therapies including mechanical circulatory support. While there have been advancements in available durable devices, many pediatric patients have size, anatomic, and physiologic constraints that make placement of adult ventricular assist devices challenging. And, Fontan failure comes in different varieties, including failure with preserved systolic function. This subset of patients requires either a subpulmonary assist device or a total artificial heart. Unique operative maneuvers, including atrial cannulation and atrioventricular valve manipulation have allowed many failing Fontan patients to be bridged to transplant after recovery of end-organ dysfunction and improved nutrition. The Advanced Cardiac Therapies Improving Outcomes Network (ACTION) is a multicenter learning network of pediatric hospitals implanting, managing, and studying VADs in children and adults with congenital heart disease.

METHODS: The study recruited 200 volunteers aged 18 years or older of both sexes diagnosed with COVID-19. Of the 200 volunteers initially selected, the 135 individuals who underwent serological testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on the first visit to the laboratory, were invited to return, after 90 days, and provide a new blood sample for a second assessment of the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. Disease severity and longevity of symptoms were evaluated for each individual and associated with the serological profile. RESULTS: Among the 135 individuals who underwent a previous serological test for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody, 125 showed reactivity to IgG (92.6%). Of the 125 individuals with detectable IgG in the first test, 87 (69.6%) showed persistence of this antibody after 90 days and 38 (30.4%) lost IgG reactivity in the second evaluation. The frequency of all reported symptoms was higher in individuals who maintained IgG persistence after 90 days of symptoms.

Using 2013-18 deidentified electronic health record data from US primary care practices, we found that provider teams outperformed solo providers, irrespective of team composition. Among solo providers, physicians and nonphysicians exhibited little meaningful difference in performance. As policy makers contemplate scope-of-practice changes, they should consider the effects of not only provider type but also team-based care on outcomes.

The goal of the insurer is to maximize its expected cumulative discounted dividend payouts until bankruptcy or maturity which comes earlier. The insurer is allowed to dynamically choose reinsurance contracts over the whole time horizon. This is a mixed singular-classical control problem and the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is a variational inequality with fully nonlinear operator and with gradient constraint. The $C^{2,1}$ smoothness of the value function and a comparison principle for its gradient function are established by penalty approximation method. We find that the surplus-time space can be divided into three non-overlapping regions by a risk-magnitude-and-time-dependent reinsurance barrier and a time-dependent dividend-payout barrier. The insurer should be exposed to higher risk as surplus increases; exposed to all the risks once surplus upward crosses the reinsurance barrier; and pay out all reserves in excess of the dividend-payout barrier. The localities of these regions are explicitly estimated.","Guan, Chonghu; Xu, Zuo Quan; Zhou, Rui",,612,1

Currently, governments and transportation industries around the world are developing strategies to minimize SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with resuming activity. This study investigated the possible use of SARS-CoV-2 RNA wastewater surveillance from airline and cruise ship sanitation systems and its potential use as a COVID-19 public health management tool. METHODS: Aircraft and cruise ship wastewater samples (n = 21) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using two virus concentration methods, adsorption-extraction by electronegative membrane (n = 13) and ultrafiltration by Amicon (n = 8), and five assays using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and RT-droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR). Representative qPCR amplicons from positive samples were sequenced to confirm assay specificity. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in samples from both aircraft and cruise ship wastewater; however concentrations were near the assay limit of detection. The analysis of multiple replicate samples and use of multiple RT-qPCR and/or RT-ddPCR assays increased detection sensitivity and minimized false-negative results. Representative qPCR amplicons were confirmed for the correct PCR product by sequencing. However, differences in sensitivity were observed among molecular assays and concentration methods. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that surveillance of wastewater from large transport vessels with their own sanitation systems has potential as a complementary data source to prioritize clinical testing and contact tracing among disembarking passengers. Importantly, sampling methods and molecular assays must be further optimized to maximize detection sensitivity. The potential for false negatives by both wastewater testing and clinical swab testing suggests that the two strategies could be employed together to maximize the probability of detecting SARS-CoV-2 infections amongst passengers.","Ahmed, Warish; Bertsch, Paul M; Angel, Nicola; Bibby, Kyle; Bivins, Aaron; Dierens, Leanne; Edson, Janette; Ehret, John; Gyawali, Pradip; Hamilton, Kerry A; Hosegood, Ian; Hugenholtz, Philip; Jiang, Guangming; Kitajima, Masaaki; Sichani, Homa T; Shi, Jiahua; Shimko, Katja M; Simpson, Stuart L; Smith, Wendy J M; Symonds, Erin M; Thomas, Kevin V; Verhagen, Rory; Zaugg, Julian; Mueller, Jochen F",J. travel med,612,15

The activity of Miglustat is here demonstrated in the micromolar range for SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The drug acts at the post-entry level and leads to a marked decrease of viral proteins and release of infectious viruses. The mechanism resides in the inhibitory activity toward &#945;-glucosidases that are involved in the early stages of glycoprotein N-linked oligosaccharide processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to a marked decrease of the viral Spike protein. Indeed, the antiviral potential of protein glycosylation inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 is further highlighted by the low-micromolar activity of the investigational drug Celgosivir.

In an effort to continue to serve the community of people who inject drugs and practice compassionate and non-judgmental care, the students transitioned the clinic to a model of TeleMOUD (medications for opioid use disorder). We describe development and implementation of a medical student-run telemedicine clinic through an academic medical center-operated syringe services program. METHODS: Students advertised TeleMOUD services at the syringe service program on social media and created an online sign-up form. They coordinated appointments and interviewed patients by phone or videoconference where they assessed patients for opioid use disorder. Supervising attending physicians also interviewed patients and prescribed buprenorphine when appropriate. Students assisted patients in obtaining medication from the pharmacy and provided support and guidance during home buprenorphine induction. RESULTS: Over the first 9 weeks in operation, 31 appointments were requested, and 22 initial telehealth appointments were completed by a team of students and attending physicians. Fifteen appointments were for MOUD and 7 for other health issues. All patients seeking MOUD were prescribed buprenorphine and 12/15 successfully picked up medications from the pharmacy. The mean time between appointment request and prescription pick-up was 9.5 days. CONCLUSIONS: TeleMOUD is feasible and successful in providing people who inject drugs with low barrier access to life-saving MOUD during the COVID-19 pandemic. This model also provided medical students with experience treating addiction during a time when they were restricted from most clinical activities.","Castillo, Marcus; Conte, Brianna; Hinkes, Sam; Mathew, Megan; Na, C J; Norindr, Ainhoa; Serota, David P; Forrest, David W; Deshpande, Amar R; Bartholomew, Tyler S; Tookes, Hansel E",Harm Reduct J,612,30

This includes the care of patients with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) who bear a disproportionate burden of both COVID-19 itself and the public health measures enacted to combat it. In this review, we summarize major COVID-19-related considerations for NCD patients and their care providers, focusing on cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, haematologic, oncologic, traumatic, obstetric/gynaecologic, operative, psychiatric, rheumatologic/immunologic, neurologic, gastrointestinal, ophthalmologic and endocrine disorders. Additionally, we offer a general framework for categorizing the pandemic's disruptions by disease-specific factors, direct health system factors and indirect health system factors. We also provide references to major NCD medical specialty professional society statements and guidelines on COVID-19. COVID-19 and its control policies have already resulted in major disruptions to the screening, treatment and surveillance of NCD patients. In addition, it differentially impacts those with pre-existing NCDs and may lead to de novo NCD sequelae. Likely, there will be long-term effects from this pandemic that will continue to affect practitioners and patients in this field for years to come.","Chang, Andrew Y; Cullen, Mark R; Harrington, Robert A; Barry, Michele",J. intern. med,612,16

We aimed at evaluating the impact of vitamin D levels on the biomarkers of acute-phase response, inflammation and glucose metabolism in a large cohort of diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography were included. Diabetes mellitus was defined as previous diagnosis, specific treatment administration (oral drug or insulin), fasting glycaemia >6.99 mmol/L or HbA1c >48 mmol/L. Glucose parameters, white blood cells, Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Monocyte-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (MLR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and vitamin D were measured at admission. Vitamin D levels were measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay kit LIAISON® Vitamin D assay (Diasorin Inc). RESULTS: We included 1472 diabetic patients and 2499 non-diabetic patients that were divided according to vitamin D tertiles. Among diabetic patients, lower levels of vitamin D were associated with female gender (P = .02), obesity (P = .004), active smoking and acute presentation (P < .001) and with a more atherogenic metabolic profile. The levels of white blood cells, leucocytes subfamilies, and inflammatory parameters significantly correlated with vitamin D levels in both patients with and without diabetes (diabetic: P = .012 for WBC, P = .004 for NLR and P < .001 for MLR and C-reactive protein, non-diabetic: P < .001 for WBC; NLR, MLR and C-reactive protein, respectively). Among diabetic patients, results were confirmed at multivariate analysis with no significant interaction according to glycaemic control. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that, among patients with cardiovascular disease, vitamin D deficiency is associated with metabolic dysregulation and with an elevation of cellular and humoural inflammatory parameters, especially among diabetics, although not being dependent from glycaemic control.","Verdoia, Monica; Nardin, Matteo; Rolla, Roberta; Negro, Federica; Gioscia, Rocco; Afifeh, Arraa Maddalena Saghir; Viglione, Filippo; Suryapranata, Harry; Marcolongo, Marco; De Luca, Giuseppe",Eur J Clin Invest,612,24

Hospital-specific forecasts of demand that provide prediction intervals, rather than point estimates, may facilitate better managerial decisions, especially when demand overage and underage are associated with high, asymmetric costs. Regional forecasts of patient demand are commonly available as a Poisson random variable, e.g., for the number of people requiring hospitalization due to an epidemic such as COVID-19. However, even in this common setting, no probabilistic, consistent, computationally tractable forecast is available for the fraction of patients in a region that a particular institution should expect. We introduce such a forecast, DICE (Demand Intervals from Consistent Estimators). We describe its development and deployment at an academic medical center in California during the `second wave' of COVID-19 in the Unite States. We show that DICE is consistent under mild assumptions and suitable for use with perfect, biased, unbiased regional forecasts. We evaluate its performance on empirical data from a large academic medical center as well as on synthetic data.","Yang, Linying; Zhang, Teng; Glynn, Peter; Scheinker, David",,612,16

This study aims to forecast the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA). In this study, grey model (GM(1,1)), nonlinear grey Bernoulli model (NGBM(1,1)) and fractional nonlinear grey Bernoulli model (FANGBM(1,1)) are compared for the prediction. Therefore, grey prediction models, especially the fractional accumulated grey model, are used for the first time in this topic and it is believed that this study fills the gap in the literature. This model is applied to predict the data for the period 19/03-22/04/2020 (35 days) and forecast the data for the period 23/04-22/05/2020. The number of cases of COVID-19 in these countries are handled cumulatively. The prediction performance of the models is measured by the calculation of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and R2values. It is obtained that FANGBM(1,1) gives the highest prediction performance with having the lowest RMSE and MAPE values and the highest R2values for these countries. Results show that the cumulative number of cases for Italy, UK and USA is forecasted to be about 233000, 189000 and 1160000, respectively, on May 22, 2020 which corresponds to the average daily rate is 0.80%, 1.19% and 1.13%, respectively, from 22/04/2020 to 22/05/2020.

In the field of functional urology, there are clinical situations with a high risk of complication if management is delayed and a great heterogeneity of advisable reprogramming times after cancellation. A prioritization of functional urology procedures is necessary to adapt management during the COVID-19 crisis and to better organize post-epidemic recovery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The advice of AFU scientific committees in the field of functional urology (neuro-urology, female and perineology, male LUTS) was requested and supplemented by a review of the currently available recommendations on the subject of urology and COVID-19. These opinions were combined to draw up temporary recommendations to help reorganize practices during the epidemic and prepare the post-critical phase. RESULTS: Most of the recommendations available on career-oriented social networks (Twitter, LinkedIn) or in literature concern cancer or general urology. Eight out of ten propose a cancellation of all functional urology procedures without distinction. But the 3 AFU committees covering the field of functional urology have identified three clinical situations in which surgical procedures that can be maintained during the COVID-19 epidemic (priority level A): conclusion of a neuromodulation test in progress (implantation or explantation), botulinum toxin A bladder injections for unbalanced neurologic bladder, cystectomy and ileal conduit for urinary fistula in perineal bedsore or refractory unbalanced neurologic bladder with acute renal failure and vesico-enteric or prostato-pubic fistulas. Management adaptation of the other pathologies are proposed, as well as the application of 3 priority levels (B, C, D) for rescheduled procedures for a better management of the post-crisis activity resumption. CONCLUSION: The joint functional urology committees indicate that there are specific clinical situations in this field that demand non-delayed care during COVID crisis. They underline the need to establish a hierarchy for the cancelled surgeries, in order to reduce the arm of long reschedule delays and to optimize post-lockdown activity resumption.","Michel, F; Gaillet, S; Cornu, J N; Robert, G; Game, X; Phé, V; Karsenty, G",Prog. urol.

Transcriptome analyses showed that genes within principal component group 1 (PC1) were associated with infection and disease severity whereas genes within PC2 were associated with recovery from COVID-19.

In July and November, more than three quarters of respondents supported mask wearing and nearly as many supported contact tracing. In regression-adjusted models, support differences for social distancing, mask wearing, and contact tracing were most pronounced by age, partisanship, and trust in science.

Therefore, we conducted a retrospective analysis of all pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within Nuvance Health system. Study design Data were abstracted from the medical records of each patient and descriptive analysis was performed. Variables included demographics, COVID testing results, symptoms, management, labor course, neonatal information, and complications. Results Total of 40 patients were identified. Average age was 29.6 years old, 35% were Hispanic, and approximately one in three patients had comorbidities. Of the patients who had repeated testing, the average number of days between first positive test and negative test was 36.8 days (+/- 19.9 days). Three out of four women reported symptoms. Of the 40 pregnant women who were positive for SARS-CoV-2, 25 of them delivered. About 84% of the women delivered after 37 weeks. Twelve percent of the women delivered under 33 and 6/7 weeks. Most patients had vaginal deliveries (68%) and the remaining had cesarean deliveries. Neonatal outcomes included: mean 1 and 5 min Apgar scores of 8 and 8.8, respectively and the mean birth weight was 3212 g.

It is a new virus disease, nobody has prior immunity to it, human population is prone to infections. In March 11 2020, WHO declared the pandemic status. The main symptoms include: fever, dry cough and fatigue. Virus proteins need mitochondrial energy for their own survival and replication. Upon viral infections, mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism can be modulated, which can influence the energy production in the host cells. Coenzyme Q10 is an integral component of mitochondrial respiratory chain and the key component of mitochondrial ATP production. The exact pathobiochemical mechanism of the disease is unknown. Modulated mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism with lower CoQ10 levels in viral infections leads us to the hypothesis that one of the main pathobiochemical effects of SARS-Cov-2 virus could be mitochondrial bioenergetics dysfunction with CoQ10 deficit leading to the reduction of its endogenous biosynthesis. The mechanism might be virus induced oxidative stress causing a mutation of one or more of the nine COQ genes, resulting in primary CoQ10 deficiency. New perspective for patients with COVID-19 may be supportive targeting therapy with coenzyme Q10 to increase the energy production, immunity and decrease oxidative stress (Fig. 1, Ref. 51).

While compelling ethics arguments have been offered on both sides of the debate, scientific and regulatory complexities may not have been fully appreciated. Furthermore, accelerated development of efficacious vaccine candidates in traditional clinical trials has diluted some of the arguments in favour of HCSs. In low- and middle-income country settings, including South Africa, the need for robust patient care conditions for the conduct of HCSs, coupled with considerations such as perceptions of risk, consent processes, remuneration, vaccine hesitancy, fear of exploitation and access to vaccines, makes HCSs challenging to justify.","Moodley, K.; Maasdorp, E.; Rennie, S.",South African Medical Journal,612,32

In Korea, a religious group-related super-spreading event triggered a sudden outbreak in Daegu city and Gyeongsangbuk-do in southeast Korea. This study was undertaken to document the clinical characteristics of patients hospitalized in Gyeongsangbuk-do. METHODS: Three hundred and fifty-two patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection hospitalized at Dongguk University Gyeongju Hospital or at the Andong Medical Center between February 18th and June 30th were enrolled in this study. Medical records were reviewed and demographic and clinical features, including comorbidities, symptoms, radiological and laboratory findings on admission were analyzed. In addition, we sought to identify risk factors of mortality. RESULTS: Mean age of the 352 study subjects was 56 years (range, 14-95). The mortality rate was 6.8% and mean age at death was 81 years (range, 57-91). The most common symptom was cough (31.8%) followed by a febrile sensation (28.4%), sputum (17.0%), sore throat (15.6%), and myalgia (13.1%). Eighty-one (23.0%) patients were asymptomatic, but a half of these patients exhibited pneumonic infiltration at presentation. Chest radiology showed no active lesion in 41.8% of the study subjects, bilateral pneumonia in 46.9%, and unilateral pneumonic infiltration in 11.4%. Among 24 patients that died, 18 subjects were transferred from a care facility. An age of &#8805; 70 years, previous history of malignancy or diabetes, and fever (&#8805; 37.5°C) on admission were found to be significant risk factors of mortality. CONCLUSION: Patients aged &#8805; 70 years, those with fever on admission, and patients with an underlying malignancy or diabetes were found to be more likely to succumb to COVID-19. Elderly in care facilities or hospitalized patients with an underlying disease should receive more attention and be considered for preventive quarantine.","Moon, Seong Su; Lee, Kwan; Park, Jungi; Yun, Seongcheol; Lee, Yun Sik; Lee, Dong Seok",J Korean Med Sci,612,16

While some studies have found increasing rates of mental health problems during the pandemic, other evidence suggest that mental symptoms and disorders were increasing before the pandemic. This study compared trends in mental healthcare use during the first 15 months of the pandemic with similar pre-pandemic trends. METHODSConsultations related to mental symptoms and disorders were identified through national registries from primary and specialist healthcare services, including hospitalizations, covering the entire population of children 6-18 years in Norway (N=908 272). The monthly likelihood of having a consultation or hospitalization related to overall mental health problems, and specific diagnoses for depression, anxiety, ADHD and sleep problems were plotted from January 2020 to May 2021 and compared to trends over the same period between 2017-2019 using event study and difference-in-difference designs. FINDINGSWe found reductions in consultations for mental health symptoms and disorders in primary and specialist healthcare during the first weeks of lockdown in 2020. This decline was temporary, and volumes of consultations quickly returned to pre-pandemic levels. However, during fall 2020, consultation volumes related to mental health in primary care increased. This increase persisted into the winter of 2021 but levelled off by the last month of the sample period. The increase in consultation volumes was about 50 % compared to the pre-pandemic period. We did not find increases in consultations in specialist healthcare, except for hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONWe found an increase in primary care consultation volumes related to mental health among children that depart from the previously established increases over recent years. We did not see similar increases in consultations in the specialist healthcare. It is unknown whether increases in primary care consultations represent milder cases, which primarily do not need specialist treatment, or if the stability in specialist healthcare consultations reflects capacity problems or timelags in referrals.","Evensen, Miriam; Hart, Rannveig Kaldager; Godoy, Anna Aasen; Hauge, Lars Johan; Lund, Ingunn Olea; Knudsen, Ann Kristin; Grotting, Maja Weemes; Suren, Pal; Reneflot, Anne",,612,26

A defining feature of EAG (Kv10-12) channels is a highly conserved domain on the amino-terminus, known as the eag-domain, consisting of a PAS domain capped by a short sequence containing an amphipathic helix (Cap-domain). The PAS and Cap domains are both vital for the normal function of EAG channels. Using heme-affinity pull-down assays and proteomics of lysates from primary cortical neurons, we identified that an EAG channel, hERG3 (Kv11.3), binds to heme. In whole cell electrophysiology experiments, we identified that heme inhibits hERG3 channel activity. In addition, we expressed the Cap and PAS domain of hERG3 in E.coli and, using spectroscopy and kinetics, identified the PAS domain as the location for heme binding. The results identify heme as a regulator of hERG3 channel activity.

SARS coronaviruses have been detected in wastewater during outbreaks in China, Europe, and the United States. In this perspective, we outline the risk fecal shedding poses at locations without safely managed sanitation, as in most of Nigeria where we work. We believe that feco-oral transmission could occur if community transmission becomes high and sustained in densely populated cities without proper sanitation in Nigeria and many other African and Asian settings. In the absence of basic sanitation, or where existing sanitation is not safely managed, groundwater, which is often drawn up from wells and boreholes for drinking and household use, can become contaminated with enteric bacteria and viruses from fecal matter. Endemic and epidemic transmission of multiple feco-oral pathogens via this route continues to be documented in areas without safely managed sanitation, and, therefore, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission needs to be evaluated, tracked, and forestalled in such settings. We suggest that fecal matter from treatment facilities and recovered patients should be carefully and properly disposed. Furthermore, environmental surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and accumulated human waste, as well as efforts to mitigate the virus' entry into unprotected household water sources, should be a priority part of the COVID-19 response in settings without safely managed sanitation for the duration of the pandemic.","Odih, Erkison E; Afolayan, Ayorinde O; Akintayo, IfeOluwa; Okeke, Iruka N",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,612,24

Models based on these acquired data may suffer from systematic errors and large estimation variances due to the biases associated with testing. An unbiased randomized testing to estimate the true fatality rate is still missing. METHODS: Here, we characterize the effect of incidental sampling bias in the estimation of epidemic dynamics. Towards this, we explicitly modeled for sampling bias in an augmented compartment model to predict epidemic dynamics. We further calculate the bias from differences in disease prediction from biased, and randomized sampling, proposing a strategy to obtain unbiased estimates. RESULTS: Our simulations demonstrate that sampling biases in favor of patients with higher disease manifestation could significantly affect direct estimates of infection and fatality rates calculated from the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths, and serological testing can partially mitigate these biased estimates. CONCLUSIONS: The augmented compartmental model allows the explicit modeling of different testing policies and their effects on disease estimates. Our calculations for the dependence of expected confidence on a randomized sample sizes, show that relatively small sample sizes can provide statistically significant estimates for SARS-CoV-2 related death rates.","Suhail, Yasir; Afzal, Junaid",BMC Med Res Methodol,612,20

As an effective framework to quantify the prediction reliability, conformal prediction (CP) was developed with the CPKNN (CP with kNN). However, the conventional CPKNN suffers from high variance and bias and long computational time as the feature dimensionality increases. To address these limitations, a new CP framework-conformal prediction with shrunken centroids (CPSC) is proposed. It regularizes the class centroids to attenuate the irrelevant features and shrink the sample space for predictions and reliability quantification. To compare CPKNN and CPSC, we employed them in the classification of 12 categories of alternative herbal medicine with electronic nose as a case and assessed them in two tasks: 1) offline prediction: the training set was fixed and the accuracy on the testing set was evaluated; 2) online prediction with data augmentation: they filtered unlabeled data to augment the training data based on the prediction reliability and the final accuracy of testing set was compared. The result shows that CPSC significantly outperformed CPKNN in both two tasks: 1) CPSC reached a significantly higher accuracy with lower computation cost, and with the same credibility output, CPSC generally achieves a higher accuracy; 2) the data augmentation process with CPSC robustly manifested a statistically significant improvement in prediction accuracy with different reliability thresholds, and the augmented data were more balanced in classes. This novel CPSC provides higher prediction accuracy and better reliability quantification, which can be a reliable assistance in decision support.","Liu, Li; Zhan, Xianghao; Yang, Xikai; Guan, Xiaoqing; Wu, Rumeng; Wang, Zhan; Luo, Zhiyuan; Wang, You; Li, Guang",,612,16

By the end of March, 2020, there were more than 180,000 confirmed cases in the US, distributed across more than 2000 counties. We find that the right tail of this distribution exhibits a power law, with Pareto exponent close to one. We investigate whether a simple model of the growth of COVID-19 cases involving Gibrat's law can explain the emergence of this power law. The model is calibrated to match (i) the growth rates of confirmed cases, and (ii) the varying lengths of time during which COVID-19 had been present within each county. Thus calibrated, the model generates a power law with Pareto exponent nearly exactly equal to the exponent estimated directly from the distribution of confirmed cases across counties at the end of March.","Beare, Brendan K.; Toda, Alexis Akira",Phys D Nonlinear Phenom,612,8

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the pooled prevalence of pre-existing AF and its short-term mortality risk in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. We searched MEDLINE and Scopus to locate all the articles published up to January 31, 2021, reporting data on pre-existing AF among COVID-19 survivors and non-survivors. The pooled prevalence of pre-existing AF was calculated using a random effects model and presenting the related 95% confidence interval (CI), while the mortality risk was estimated using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with odds ratio (OR) and related 95% CI. Statistical heterogeneity was measured using the Higgins I2 statistic. RESULTS: Twelve studies, enrolling 15.562 COVID-19 patients (mean age 71.6 years), met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. The pooled prevalence of pre-existing AF was 11.0% of cases (95% CI: 7.8-15.2%, p < 0.0001) with high heterogeneity (I2 = 95.2%). Pre-existing AF was associated with higher risk of short-term death (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.47-3.36, p < 0.0001), with high heterogeneity (I2 = 79.1%).

Service staff identified significant benefits from the changes to the way services were delivered as well as some impediments and challenges. Advantages in the new way of working revolved around the flexibility of the virtual service, with appointments online enabling families to more easily overcome issues of transport, work commitments, childcare and disruption to routines and timing. The online platforms also enabled some family members to participate who otherwise might not have been able to come to appointments in person. Disadvantages included where there were issues with availability and access to appropriate technology or private spaces, or when the young person was very young, very unwell, unstable, isolated or at higher risk.

Design: Prospective cross-sectional observational study. Setting: An acute NHS healthcare provider. Participants: All inpatient wards were fully occupied by patients with COVID-19 at the time of sampling. Interventions: Air and surface samples were collected from a range of clinical areas and a public area of the hospital. An active air sampler was used to collect three or four 1.0 m3 air samples in each area. Surface samples were collected by swabbing approximately 25 cm2 of items in the immediate vicinity of each air sample. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-qPCR and viral culture using Vero E6 and Caco2 cells; additionally the limit of detection for culturing SARS-CoV-2 dried onto surfaces was determined. Main outcome measures: SARS-CoV-2 detected by PCR or culture. Results: Viral RNA was detected on 114/218 (52.3%) of surface and 14/31 (38.7%) air samples but no virus was cultured. The proportion of surface samples contaminated with viral RNA varied by item sampled and by clinical area. Viral RNA was detected on surfaces and in air in public areas of the hospital but was more likely to be found in areas immediately occupied by COVID-19 patients (67/105 (63.8%) in areas immediately occupied by COVID-19 patients vs. 29/64 (45.3%) in other areas (odds ratio 0.5, 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.9, p=0.025, Fishers exact test). The PCR Ct value for all surface and air samples (>30) indicated a viral load that would not be culturable. Conclusions: Our findings of extensive viral RNA contamination of surfaces and air across a range of acute healthcare settings in the absence of cultured virus underlines the potential risk from surface and air contamination in managing COVID-19, and the need for effective use of PPE, social distancing, and hand/surface hygiene.","Zhou, J.; Otter, J.; Price, J.

Flow cytometric analysis showed that both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were involved in cellular responses against SARS-CoV infection. Interestingly, most of SARS-CoV S-specific memory CD4(+) T cells were central memory cells expressing CD45RO(+) CCR7(+) CD62L(−). However, the majority of memory CD8(+) T cells revealed effector memory phenotype expressing CD45RO(−) CCR7(−) CD62L(−).

Therefore, an instrument is required to evaluate the effects of the virtual patient learning system in South Korea. OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity and reliability of the Korean version of the Virtual Patient Learning System Evaluation Tool (K-VPLSET). DESIGN: This is a methodological study. SETTINGS: This study was conducted via an online survey for Korean nursing students. PARTICIPANTS: The present study included 373 participants who were 3rd and 4th year Korean nursing students. METHODS: After translating the English version of VPLSET into Korean, a pilot test with a cognitive interview was undertaken to ensure that the meaning of original instrument and appropriateness for Korean nursing students had been retained. The content validity of the K-VPLSET was examined by a panel of six experts. Convenience sampling was used to recruit 3rd and 4th year Korean nursing students, among whom 170 were recruited for exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and 203 for confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). SPSS version 26.0 was used for EFA, whereas AMOS version 22.0 was used for CFA. RESULTS: From the 32 initial items, the final version of the K-VPLSET ultimately included 20 items, with a Cronbach's α of 0.89. EFA identified four factors (“Nursing Knowledge Improvement,” “Clinical Competency Development,” “Confidence in Nursing Performance,” and “Nursing Care Plan Application”) that explained 56.9% of the total variance. CFA confirmed the validity of the instrument. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirmed that the K-VPLSET is a valid and reliable instrument for assessing the effects of the virtual patient learning system, through which the quality of e-learning for Korea nursing students can be determined.","An, Hae Jeong; Choi, Jung Suk; Roh, Min; Cho, Hyun Mi; Choi, Eun Ju",Nurse Educ Today,612,24

She has had undulant headache and vision loss episodes in both eyes for fifteen days. Her VPS valve was normal when manually checked and her VPS was observed as intact on X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) scan. She had high-grade papilledema in both eyes with an optical coherence eye tomography (OCT) scan value of 55/99. Lumbar puncture (LP) was performed. Her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure was 560 mm H2O under sedation. We did a VPS exploration procedure. There was a tiny defect over the shunt valve from where clear CSF was leaking.

We present SWIFT (SpO(2) Waveform ICU Forecasting Technique), a deep learning model that predicts blood oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) waveforms 5 and 30 minutes in the future using only prior SpO(2) values as inputs. When tested on novel data, SWIFT predicts more than 80% and 60% of hypoxemic events in critically ill and COVID-19 patients, respectively. SWIFT also predicts SpO(2) waveforms with average MSE below .0007. SWIFT provides information on both occurrence and magnitude of potential hypoxemic events 30 minutes in advance, allowing it to be used to inform clinical interventions, patient triaging, and optimal resource allocation. SWIFT may be used in clinical decision support systems to inform the management of critically ill patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Annapragada, Akshaya V.; Greenstein, Joseph L.; Bose, Sanjukta N.; Winters, Bradford D.; Sarma, Sridevi V.; Winslow, Raimond L.",medRxiv,612,29

This work proposes a patient-independent model for the estimation of well-aerated volume of lungs in CT images (WAVE). Methods A Gaussian fit, with mean (Mu.f) and width (Sigma.f) values, was applied to the lower CT histogram data points of the lung to provide the estimation of the well-aerated lung volume (WAVE.f). Independence from CT reconstruction parameters and respiratory cycle was analysed using healthy lung CT images and 4DCT acquisitions. The Gaussian metrics and first order radiomic features calculated for a third cohort of COVID-19 patients were compared with those relative to healthy lungs. Each lung was further segmented in 24 subregions and a new biomarker derived from Gaussian fit parameter Mu.f was proposed to represent the local density changes. Results WAVE.f resulted independent from the respiratory motion in 80% of the cases. Differences of 1%, 2% and up to 14% resulted comparing a moderate iterative strength and FBP algorithm, 1 and 3 mm of slice thickness and different reconstruction kernel.Healthy subjects were significantly different from COVID-19 patients for all the metrics calculated. Graphical representation of the local biomarker provides spatial and quantitative information in a single 2D picture. Conclusions Unlike other metrics based on fixed histogram thresholds, this model is able to consider the inter- and intra-subject variability. In addition, it defines a local biomarker to quantify the severity of the disease, independently ofthe observer.","Berta, L.; De Mattia, C.; Rizzetto, F.; Carrazza, S.; Colombo, P.

The relative role of restrictions on behaviour (”lockdowns”) and of a natural slowing for other reasons is difficult to asses when mass testing was not widely done. This paper assesses the evolution of the spread of the COVID 19 virus over this period when there was not data on test results for a large, random sample of the population. METHOD: We estimate a version of the SIR model applied to data on the numbers who were tested positive in several countries over the period when the virus spread very fast and then its spread slowed sharply. Up to the end of April 2020 test data came from non random samples of populations who were overwhelmingly those who displayed symptoms. Using data from a period when the criteria used for testing (which was that people had clear symptoms) was relatively consistent is important in drawing out the message from test results. We use this data to assess two things: how large might be the group of those infected who were not recorded; how effective were lockdown measures in slowing the spread of the infection. RESULTS: We find that to match data on daily new cases of the virus, the estimated model favours high values for the number of people infected but not recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the infection may have spread far enough in many countries by April 2020 to have been a significant factor behind the fall in measured new cases. Government restrictions on behavior ‐ lockdowns ‐ were only one factor behind slowing in the spread of the virus.","Miles, David Kenneth; Dimdore‐Miles, Oscar",Int J Clin Pract,612,32

Now, we are entering the second phase of the pandemics in which the spread of the virus needs to be contained within the limits that national health systems can cope with. This second phase of the epidemics is expected to last until a vaccination is available or herd immunity is reached. Long-term management strategies thus need to be developed. Methods: In this paper we present a new agent-based simulation model ""COVID-19 ABM"" with which we simulate 4 alternative scenarios for the second ""new normality"" phase that can help decision-makers to take adequate control and intervention measures. Results: The scenarios resulted in distinctly different outcomes. A continued lockdown could regionally eradicate the virus within a few months, whereas a relaxation back to 80% of former activity-levels was followed by a second outbreak. Contact-tracing as well as adaptive response strategies could keep COVID-19 within limits. Conclusion: The main insights are that low-level voluntary use of tracing apps shows no relevant effects on containing the virus, whereas medium or high-level tracing allows maintaining a considerably higher level of social activity. Adaptive control strategies help in finding the level of least restrictions. A regional approach to adaptive management can further help in fine-tuning the response to regional dynamics and thus minimise negative economic effects.","Wallentin, Gudrun; Kaziyeva, Dana; Reibersdorfer-Adelsberger, Eva",Int J Health Policy Manag,612,1

In this study, we aim to investigate how interferons differentially stimulate the interferon‐inducible transmembrane (IFITM) family proteins and further be involved in the process of heart development. The expression levels of three IFITM family members, IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 were investigated during Sprague–Dawley rat myocardial development and differentiation of H9C2 cardiomyocytes. The effects of interferon‐α, ‐β, and ‐γ on DNA synthesis in H9C2 cells were also characterized. Up‐regulation of IFITM1 and IFITM3 were observed during the heart development of Sprague–Dawley rat and the differentiation of H9C2 cells. Moreover, interferon‐α and ‐β induce the expression of IFITM3 while interferon‐γ up‐regulates IFITM1.

Previous studies of iron parameters in COVID-19 are cross-sectional and have not studied catalytic iron, the biologically most active form of iron. The study was done to determine the role of catalytic iron in the adverse outcomes in COVID-19. We enrolled adult patients hospitalized with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and measured serum iron, transferrin saturation, ferritin, hepcidin and serum catalytic iron daily. Primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, and kidney replacement therapy. Associations between longitudinal iron parameter measurements and time-to-event outcomes were examined using a joint model. We enrolled 120 patients (70 males) with median age 50 years. The primary composite outcome was observed in 25 (20.8%) patients—mechanical ventilation was needed in 21 (17.5%) patients and in-hospital mortality occurred in 21 (17.5%) patients. Baseline levels of ferritin and hepcidin were significantly associated with the primary composite outcome. The joint model analysis showed that ferritin levels were significantly associated with primary composite outcome [HR (95% CI) = 2.63 (1.62, 4.24) after adjusting for age and gender]. Both ferritin and serum catalytic iron levels were positively associated with in-hospital mortality [HR (95% CI) = 3.22 (2.05, 5.07) and 1.73 (1.21, 2.47), respectively], after adjusting for age and gender. The study shows an association of ferritin and catalytic iron with adverse outcomes in COVID-19. This suggests new pathophysiologic pathways in this disease, also raising the possibility of considering iron chelation therapy.","Chakurkar, Vipul; Rajapurkar, Mohan; Lele, Suhas; Mukhopadhyay, Banibrata; Lobo, Valentine; Injarapu, Ramakrishna; Sheikh, Muddassir; Dholu, Bharatkumar; Ghosh, Arpita; Jha, Vivekanand",Sci Rep,612,19

Solar cycles and related changes in the geomagnetic field, variations in water temperature and weather conditions, coast geographical features and human activities have been proposed as possible causes. In December 2009, a pod of seven male sperm whales stranded along the Adriatic coast of Southern Italy. This is the sixth instance from 1555 in this basin. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Complete necropsies were performed on three whales whose bodies were in good condition, carrying out on sampled tissues histopathology, virology, bacteriology, parasitology, and screening of veins looking for gas emboli. Furthermore, samples for age determination, genetic studies, gastric content evaluation, stable isotopes and toxicology were taken from all the seven specimens. The animals were part of the same group and determined by genetic and photo-identification to be part of the Mediterranean population. Causes of death did not include biological agents, or the “gas and fat embolic syndrome”, associated with direct sonar exposure. Environmental pollutant tissue concentrations were relatively high, in particular organochlorinated xenobiotics. Gastric content and morphologic tissue examinations showed a prolonged starvation, which likely caused, at its turn, the mobilization of lipophilic contaminants from the adipose tissue. Chemical compounds subsequently entered the blood circulation and may have impaired immune and nervous functions. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A multi-factorial cause underlying this sperm whales' mass stranding is proposed herein based upon the results of postmortem investigations as well as of the detailed analyses of the geographical and historical background. The seven sperm whales took the same “wrong way” into the Adriatic Sea, a potentially dangerous trap for Mediterranean sperm whales.

We aimed to compare mental health outcomes, risk and protective factors for posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), probable depression, and anxiety between HCW working in COVID‐19 and non‐COVID‐19 wards. METHODS: A self‐report survey, administered in a large tertiary hospital in Israel during the peak of the COVID‐19 outbreak was completed by 828 HCW (42.2% physicians, 57.8% nurses. Patient‐Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System; the Patient Health Questionnaire‐9; the Primary Care‐Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Screen for DSM‐5 (PC‐PTSD‐5) were used for assessing anxiety, depression, and PTSS, respectively. Pandemic‐related stress factors, negative experiences, and potential protective factors were also assessed. RESULTS: Median PC‐PTSD scores differed significantly between study teams (χ (2) [5] = 17.24; p = .004). Prevalence of probable depression and anxiety were similar in both groups. Risk factors for mental health outcomes included mental exhaustion, anxiety about being infected and infecting family. Overall, higher proportion of the COVID‐19 team witnessed patient deaths as compared to the non‐COVID‐19 team (50.2% vs. 24.7%).

Although establishing verbal reference is a pivotal achievement, questions concerning its developmental origins remain. To address this gap, we investigate infants’ ability to establish a representation of an object, hidden from view, from language input alone. In two experiments, 15-month-olds (N = 72) and 12-month-olds (N = 72) watch as an actor names three familiar, visible objects; she then provides a novel name for a fourth, hidden fully from infants’ view. In the Semantic Priming condition, the visible familiar objects all belong to the same semantic neighborhood (e.g., apple, banana, orange). In the No Priming condition, the objects are drawn from different semantic neighborhoods (e.g., apple, shoe, car). At test infants view two objects. If infants can use the naming information alone to identify the likely referent, then infants in the Semantic Priming, but not in the No Priming condition, will successfully infer the referent of the fourth (hidden) object.

Neutralizing antibodies that block RBD-ACE2 interaction are candidates for the development of targeted therapeutics(7–17). Llama-derived single-domain antibodies (nanobodies, ~15 kDa) offer advantages in bioavailability, amenability, and production and storage owing to their small sizes and high stability. Here, we report the rapid selection of 99 synthetic nanobodies (sybodies) against RBD by in vitro selection using three libraries.

Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 patients. Several clinical trials have been proposed to overcome this disease and many are still under investigation. In this review, we will be focusing on the potency of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MSC-derived secretome for treating COVID-19 patients. Fever, cough, headache, dizziness, and fatigue are the common clinical manifestations in COVID-19 patients. In mild and severe cases, cytokines are released hyper-actively which causes a cytokine storm leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In order to maintain the lung microenvironment in COVID-19 patients, MSCs are used as cell-based therapy approaches as they can act as cell managers which accelerate the immune system to prevent the cytokine storm and promote endogenous repair. Besides, MSCs have shown minimal expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2, and hence, MSCs are free from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Numerous clinical studies have started worldwide and demonstrated that MSCs have great potential for ARDS treatment in COVID-19 patients. Preliminary data have shown that MSCs and MSC-derived secretome appear to be promising in the treatment of COVID-19.

However, several clinical trials have been proposed to overcome this disease and one of them is using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MSC-derived secretome for treating COVID-19 patients. During the infection, cytokines are released hyper-actively which causes a cytokine storm. MSCs play an important role in maintaining the lung microenvironment in COVID-19 patients. They can act as cell managers which accelerate the immune system to prevent the cytokine storm and promote the endogenous repair. Therefore, it is important to explore the clinical trial in the world for treating the COVID-19 disease using MSCs and MSC-derived secretome.","Chouw, Angliana; Milanda, Tiana; Sartika, Cynthia Retna; Kirana, Marsya Nilam; Halim, Danny; Faried, Ahmad",Regen Eng Transl Med,612,20

Admission Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) and Lung Ultrasound (LUS) can be of great help in clinical decision making, especially during the current pandemic and the consequent overcrowding of the Emergency Department (ED). The aim of the study was to demonstrate the capability of alveolar-to-arterial oxygen difference (AaDO(2)) in predicting the need for subsequent oxygen support and survival in patients with COVID-19 infection, especially in the presence of baseline normal PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (P/F) values. Methods: A cohort of 223 swab-confirmed COVID-19 patients underwent clinical evaluation, blood tests, ABG and LUS in the ED. LUS score was derived from 12 ultrasound lung windows. AaDO(2) was derived as AaDO(2) = ((FiO(2)) (Atmospheric pressure − H(2)O pressure) − (PaCO(2)/R)) − PaO(2). Endpoints were subsequent oxygen support need and survival. Results: A close relationship between AaDO(2) and P/F and between AaDO(2) and LUS score was observed (R(2) = 0.88 and R(2) = 0.67, respectively; p < 0.001 for both). In the subgroup of patients with P/F between 300 and 400, 94.7% (n = 107) had high AaDO(2) values, and 51.4% (n = 55) received oxygen support, with 2 ICU admissions and 10 deaths. According to ROC analysis, AaDO(2) > 39.4 had 83.6% sensitivity and 90.5% specificity (AUC 0.936; p < 0.001) in predicting subsequent oxygen support, whereas a LUS score > 6 showed 89.7% sensitivity and 75.0% specificity (AUC 0.896; p < 0.001). Kaplan–Meier curves showed different mortality in the AaDO(2) subgroups (p = 0.0025). Conclusions: LUS and AaDO(2) are easy and effective tools, which allow bedside risk stratification in patients with COVID-19, especially when P/F values, signs, and symptoms are not indicative of severe lung dysfunction.","Secco, Gianmarco; Salinaro, Francesco; Bellazzi, Carlo; La Salvia, Marco; Delorenzo, Marzia; Zattera, Caterina; Barcella, Bruno; Resta, Flavia; Vezzoni, Giulia; Bonzano, Marco; Cappa, Giovanni; Bruno, Raffaele; Casagranda, Ivo; Perlini, Stefano",Diagnostics (Basel),612,1

In Japan, the remarkable temperature increase in summer caused by an urban heat island and climate change has become a threat to public health in recent years. METHODS: This study aimed to determine the potential risk factors for heatstroke by analysing data extracted from the records of emergency transport to the hospital due to heatstroke in Fukuoka City, Japan. In this regard, a negative binomial regression model was used to account for overdispersion in the data. Age-structure analyses of heatstroke patients were also embodied to identify the sub-population of Fukuoka City with the highest susceptibility. RESULTS: The daily maximum temperature and wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT), along with differences in both the mean temperature and time-weighted temperature from those of the consecutive past days were detected as significant risk factors for heatstroke. Results indicated that there was a positive association between the resulting risk factors and the probability of heatstroke occurrence. The elderly of Fukuoka City aged 70 years or older were found to be the most vulnerable to heatstroke. Most of the aforementioned risk factors also encountered significant and positive associations with the risk of heatstroke occurrence for the group with highest susceptibility. CONCLUSION: These results can provide insights for health professionals and stakeholders in designing their strategies to reduce heatstroke patients and to secure the emergency transport systems in summer.","Toosty, Nishat Tasnim; Hagishima, Aya; Tanaka, Ken-Ichi",PLoS One,612,27

We evaluated the protective role of Euglena tuba extract (ETME) against LPS induced inflammatory response and oxidative stress in male Balb/c mice. Male Balb/c mice were divided into 4 groups. Group 1 (control) were intraperitoneally administered 0.5 mL PBS. Group 2, 3 and 4 were treated with a single dose of LPS (i.p. 40 mg/kg body weight). Prior 1 h, Group 3 and 4 received orally 100 mg/kg body weight and 200 mg/kg body weight ETME respectively. Biomarkers of oxidative stress including TBARS, SOD, Catalase, Liver marker enzyme (SGPT and SGOT), Nitric Oxide, and inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF-α, were estimated in serum. Oxidative stress and inflammatory markers were significantly increased in the LPS treated group, whereas ETME treated group at different concentrations protected mice from pro inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Our results indicate that 70% methanolic extract of Euglena tuba can efficiently counteract free radical generation and increased level of inflammatory cytokine in an LPS induced mice model.","Kesherwani, Rashmi; Kumar, Raushan; Minhas, Ujla; Rizvi, Syed Ibrahim",Biologia (Bratisl),612,20

The objective of this study was to determine the predictive value of incidental right ventricular (RV) abnormalities identified on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans for mortality and pulmonary hypertension (PH). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all low-risk SPECT studies in patients without known coronary artery or pulmonary vascular disease, performed at our institution, from 2007-2020. Adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between incidental RV abnormalities on low-risk SPECT studies and outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 4761 patients included in the analysis, mortality events were present in 494, and echocardiographic PH was present in 619. Incidental RV abnormalities on low-risk SPECT studies were significantly and independently associated with all-cause mortality (HR = 1.41, CI [1.07-1.86], P = 0.0152) and echocardiographic PH (HR = 2.06, CI [1.64-2.60], P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest incidental RV abnormalities found on low-risk SPECT imaging studies are significantly and independently associated with increased mortality and risk of developing echocardiographic PH, and could identify high-risk patients for closer monitoring and additional diagnostic testing.

In this context, spatial information is always of great significance. The aim of this study is to describe the development of a Web GIS based on open source products for the collection and analysis of COVID-19 cases and its feasibility in terms of technical implementation and data protection. METHODS: With the help of this Web GIS, data on this issue were collected voluntarily from the Cologne area. Using house perimeters as a data basis, it was possible to check, in conjunction with the Official Topographic Cartographic Information System object type catalog, whether buildings with certain functions, for example residential building with trade and services, have been visited more frequently by infected persons than other types of buildings. In this context, data protection and ethical and legal issues were considered. RESULTS: The results of this study show that the development of a Web GIS for the generation and evaluation of volunteered geographic information (VGI) with the help of open source software is possible. Furthermore, there are numerous data protection and ethical and legal aspects to consider, which not only affect VGI per se but also affect IT security. CONCLUSIONS: From a data protection perspective, more attention needs to be paid to the intervention and post-processing of data. In addition, official data must always be used as a reference for the actual spatial consideration of the number of infections. However, VGI provides added value at a small-scale level, so that valid information can also be reliably derived in the context of health issues. The creation of guidelines for the consideration of data protection, ethical aspects, and legal requirements in the context of VGI-based applications must also be considered.

Just four months later, more than 100,000 people were diagnosed with COVID-19, the resulting disease. The genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that this virus is a new Betacoronavirus, closely related to bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses. Clinical data from hospitals in China have revealed that approximately 10% of the infected patients have severe disease requiring intensive care. Since containment of the outbreak may have partially failed due to asymptomatic transmission, it is imperative to accelerate the development of rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests, vaccines, and therapeutics for the COVID-19 epidemic. A novel coronavirus — officially named as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 by the authorities — emerged in Wuhan, China, toward the end of 2019 [1, 2]. Just four months later, more than 100,000 cases have been diagnosed with the resulting disease, COVID-19, in more than 100 countries at the time of writing this paper [3]. Not only does mainland China have the most number of reported cases (94.4%), but its case-fatality rate is also relatively higher than that of other countries as of February 28, 2020 (China: 3.5%, 2,791 deaths among 78,961 confirmed cases; other countries: 1.4%, 67 deaths among 4,691 confirmed cases) [4]. In an attempt to restrict the outbreak, China quickly implemented an unprecedented measure of quarantining 35 million people in Wuhan and several other cities, but its impact on slowing the global spread of the virus now seems inadequate. In fact, the number of cases in local human-to-human transmission kept soaring in several countries as of March 25, 2020: Italy 63,927 cases, United States of America 42,164 cases, and Spain 33,089 cases [3]. In Japan, 1,128 cases were confirmed based on positive viral nucleic acid test results, and the overall case-fatality rate was 3.7% (i.e., 42 deaths) [3].","Kikuchi, Toshiaki",Respir Investig,612,8

Aiming at screening for fungal secondary pneumonia, we collected the data of our first 27 ICU patients, who underwent bronchoalveolar lavage or bronchial aspirates. We classified the patients based on the recently published study on invasive aspergillosis in influenza patients in your journal (Schauwvlinghe et al., 2018.) and found 33% of our COVID-19 patients with putative invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Observing such a high prevalence in COVID-infected patients was somehow unexpected since the 30% prevalence of invasive aspergillosis in influenza patients has been attributed to the action of oseltamivir on anti-Aspergillus immunity. Almost all critically ill COVID-19 patients develop ARDS and are likely to receive high-dose steroids or immunomodulatory therapies to prevent worsening as suggested by reports from China. In the COVID-19 patients with putative invasive aspergillosis, antifungal prophylactic therapy may be questioned to avoid increased lung inflammation that may compromise the outcome. This issue remains to be addressed in future clinical trials. We are strongly convinced that testing deep lung specimens for Aspergillus in severe COVID-19 patients should be recommended. This message is major, given the high mortality rate of COVID-19 patients in the ICU.","Alanio, A.; Delliere, S.; Fodil, S.; Bretagne, S.; Megarbane, B.",,612,26

Objective We sought to investigate whether the duration of wheezy episodes in young children depends on the microbial trigger. Methods Two hundred eighty-three children from the Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood2000 at-risk birth cohort were prospectively examined for common airway pathogenic bacteria and viruses during acute wheezy episodes in the first 3 years of life. Findings were related to symptomatic duration of episodes, as monitored in daily diary cards from birth. Results Eight hundred thirty-seven samples were investigated for viruses, bacteria, or both. Both viruses and bacteria were identified in 55% of episodes, bacteria were identified exclusively in 31% of episodes, and viruses were identified exclusively in 10% of episodes. The median duration of acute symptoms was 9 days (interquartile range, 5-16 days), and duration was independent of bacterial or viral species. Conclusions The duration of wheezy episodes was independent of pathogenic airway bacterial or viral species. This suggests that symptom burden from infections is dependent on other factors, such as environmental exposures or host factors. The common term viral wheeze seems inappropriate in view of the finding of pathogenic bacteria in 86% of wheezy episodes.","Carlsson, Christian J.; Vissing, Nadja H.; Sevelsted, Astrid; Johnston, Sebastian L.; Bønnelykke, Klaus; Bisgaard, Hans",Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,612,16
