Both case subjects were insufficiently active prior to participating in the BELL trial. Subjects trained five days a week accruing a large training load volume (calculated as kettlebell weight multiplied by repetitions performed) during structured group-based classes (74,872 kg and 110,132 kg, respectively). Regional dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to assess BMD at the hip and lumbar spine. Increases in BMD of 12.7% and 5.9% at the femoral neck and lumbar spine (L2-L4) respectively were observed for the female, and 2.5% and 6.0% respectively for the male. Magnitude of change in BMD (g/cm2) at the lumbar spine was 2.0 and 1.9 times larger than the least significant change for the female and male respectively, and sufficient to advance the female subject's status from osteoporosis to osteopenia. Although these results do not show a definitive causal relationship between kettlebell training and increased BMD, further investigation of the effects of kettlebell training on BMD in older adults with osteoporosis and osteopenia is warranted.","Meigh, N.

We need to understand predictors of poor mental health to identify at-risk women, and targets for support. BACKGROUND: Previous research has demonstrated a relationship between low levels of perceived social support, and depression and anxiety in pregnant women. However, there is a lack of research into the factors that may mediate this relationship. AIM: As social distancing measures (e.g., lockdown) are likely to negatively affect women's perceived support in the prenatal period, we investigated the relationship between perceived social support and both anxiety and depression in UK-based pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, we examined two potential mediators that may contribute to psychological symptoms: repetitive negative thinking and loneliness. METHODS: We administered a battery of online measures to a sample of pregnant women (N=205) between May-June 2020, during the first peak of the pandemic in the UK, when perceived social support was likely to be low. RESULTS: Consistent with predictions, perceived social support was significantly negatively related to depression, anxiety, loneliness and repetitive negative thinking. Furthermore, repetitive negative thinking and loneliness mediated the relationship between perceived social support and both depression and anxiety. Moreover, perceived social support and loneliness were associated with specific types of online behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the findings shed light on the processes through which social support may exert its effects on depression and anxiety and highlight potential therapeutic targets for interventions which aim to prevent and treat mood disorders in perinatal cohorts.","Harrison, Virginia; Moulds, Michelle L; Jones, Katie",Women and birth (Online),934,20

Concerns of a similar trend during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to the formation of a workgroup* to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 deaths in the AI/AN population. As of December 2, 2020, CDC has reported 2,689 COVID-19-associated deaths among non-Hispanic AI/AN persons in the United States. A recent analysis found that the cumulative incidence of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases among AI/AN persons was 3.5 times that among White persons (3). Among 14 participating states, the age-adjusted AI/AN COVID-19 mortality rate (55.8 deaths per 100,000; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 52.5-59.3) was 1.8 (95% CI = 1.7-2.0) times that among White persons (30.3 deaths per 100,000; 95% CI = 29.9-30.7). Although COVID-19 mortality rates increased with age among both AI/AN and White persons, the disparity was largest among those aged 20-49 years. Among persons aged 20-29 years, 30-39 years, and 40-49 years, the COVID-19 mortality rates among AI/AN were 10.5, 11.6, and 8.2 times, respectively, those among White persons. Evidence that AI/AN communities might be at increased risk for COVID-19 illness and death demonstrates the importance of documenting and understanding the reasons for these disparities while developing collaborative approaches with federal, state, municipal, and tribal agencies to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on AI/AN communities. Together, public health partners can plan for medical countermeasures and prevention activities for AI/AN communities.","Arrazola, Jessica; Masiello, Matthew M; Joshi, Sujata; Dominguez, Adrian E; Poel, Amy; Wilkie, Crisandra M; Bressler, Jonathan M; McLaughlin, Joseph; Kraszewski, Jennifer; Komatsu, Kenneth K; Peterson Pompa, Xandy; Jespersen, Megan; Richardson, Gillian; Lehnertz, Nicholas; LeMaster, Pamela; Rust, Britney; Keyser Metobo, Alison; Doman, Brooke; Casey, David; Kumar, Jessica; Rowell, Alyssa L; Miller, Tracy K; Mannell, Mike; Naqvi, Ozair; Wendelboe, Aaron M; Leman, Richard; Clayton, Joshua L; Barbeau, Bree; Rice, Samantha K; Warren-Mears, Victoria; Echo-Hawk, Abigail; Apostolou, Andria; Landen, Michael",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,934,1

This variant, unlike ERAP2-wt, is unable to trim peptides to be loaded on MHC class I molecules, but it can still dimerize with both ERAP2-wt and ERAP1-wt, thus contributing to profiling an alternative cellular immune-peptidome. In order to verify if the expression of ERAP2/Iso3 may be induced by other pathogens, PBMCs and MDMs isolated from 20 healthy subjects were stimulated with flu, LPS, CMV, HIV-AT-2, SARS-CoV-2 antigens to analyze its mRNA and protein expression. In parallel, Calu3 cell lines and PBMCs were in vitro infected with growing doses of SARS-CoV-2 (0.5, 5, 1000 MOI) and HIV-1BAL (0.1, 1, and 10 ng p24 HIV-1Bal/1 × 106 PBMCs) viruses, respectively. Results showed that: (1) ERAP2/Iso3 mRNA expression can be prompted by many pathogens and it is coupled with the modulation of several determinants (cytokines, interferon-stimulated genes, activation/inhibition markers, antigen-presentation elements) orchestrating the anti-microbial immune response (Quantigene); (2) ERAP2/Iso3 mRNA is translated into a protein (western blot); (3) ERAP2/Iso3 mRNA expression is sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 concentration. Considering the key role played by ERAPs in antigen processing and presentation, it is conceivable that these enzymes may be potential targets and modulators of the pathogenicity of infectious diseases and further analyses are needed to define the role played by the different isoforms.","Saulle, Irma; Vanetti, Claudia; Goglia, Sara; Vicentini, Chiara; Tombetti, Enrico; Garziano, Micaela; Clerici, Mario; Biasin, Mara",,934,10

However, it remains unclear how genetic variations in ACE2 may affect its function and structure, and consequently alter the recognition by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We have systemically characterized missense variants in the gene ACE2 using data from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD; N = 141,456). To investigate the putative deleterious role of missense variants, six existing functional prediction tools were applied to evaluate their impact. We further analyzed the structural flexibility of ACE2 and its protein-protein interface with the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 using our developed Legion Interfaces Analysis (LiAn) program. RESULTS: Here, we characterized a total of 12 ACE2 putative deleterious missense variants. Of those 12 variants, we further showed that p.His378Arg could directly weaken the binding of catalytic metal atom to decrease ACE2 activity and p.Ser19Pro could distort the most important helix to the S-protein. Another seven missense variants may affect secondary structures (i.e. p.Gly211Arg; p.Asp206Gly; p.Arg219Cys; p.Arg219His, p.Lys341Arg, p.Ile468Val, and p.Ser547Cys), whereas p.Ile468Val with AF = 0.01 is only present in Asian. CONCLUSIONS: We provide strong evidence of putative deleterious missense variants in ACE2 that are present in specific populations, which could disrupt the function and structure of ACE2. These findings provide novel insight into the genetic variation in ACE2 which may affect the SARS-CoV-2 recognition and infection, and COVID-19 susceptibility and treatment.","Guo, Xingyi; Chen, Zhishan; Xia, Yumin; Lin, Weiqiang; Li, Hongzhi",J Transl Med,934,1

In all, 38% were using only over-the-counter (OTC) medications for treatment, and 42%, 7%, and 8% had ever received subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT), sublingual allergy drops, or SLIT-tablets, respectively; 56% and 85% reported that they had never discussed SCIT or SLIT, respectively, with their health care provider. Of the health care provider respondents, 45%, 58%, and 20% were very likely to discuss OTC medications, SCIT, or SLIT, respectively. Allergists were more inclined to discuss SCIT with their patients than other health care providers (82% versus 33%, respectively). Most allergists (67%) and other health care providers (62%) reported that they did not use an AIT shared decision-making tool, primarily because of unawareness. Conclusion: The patients with nasal allergies continued to report inadequate symptom control and activity impairment. SLIT-tablets and AIT shared decision-making tools were underused. In the coronavirus disease 2019 era, social distancing may limit office visits, which impacts SCIT administration and prompts increased use of telemedicine and a possible advantage for at-home-administered SLIT-tablets over SCIT.","Winders, Tonya; DuBuske, Lawrence; Bukstein, Don A; Meltzer, Eli O; Wallace, Dana; Rance, Karen",Allergy Asthma Proc,934,32

We investigated antibody and cytokine responses in ACTT-1 study participants enrolled at our center. We studied serum specimens from 19 hospitalized adults with COVID-19 randomized to treatment with remdesivir or placebo. We assessed SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses and identified cytokine signatures using hierarchical clustering. We identified no clear immunologic trends attributable to remdesivir treatment. Seven subjects were initially seronegative at study enrollment, and all four deaths occurred in this group with more recent symptom onset. We identified three dominant cytokine signatures, demonstrating different disease trajectories.","Thiede, Joshua M; Gress, Abigail R; Libby, Samuel D; Ronayne, Christine E; Matchett, William E; Noren, Brooke; Billings, Joanne L; Menachery, Vineet D; Langlois, Ryan A; Kline, Susan; Bold, Tyler D",J. infect. dis,934,1

We find that, in response to an uncertainty shock, the peak decrease in industrial production and inflation is around three and a half times larger during pessimistic times. We build an assessment of the role of uncertainty for a path of innovations consistent with the increase in the observed VSTOXX measure of uncertainty since the outset of the COVID-19 epidemics in February and March 2020. Industrial production is predicted to experience a year-over-year peak loss of around 9.2% in the fourth quarter of 2020, and subsequently to recover with a rebound to pre-crisis levels roughly in June 2021. The large impact is the result of an extreme shock to uncertainty occurring at a time of very negative expectations for the economic outlook. We conduct simulations that quantify the potential benefit of recovered confidence in reducing the uncertainty-induced losses associated with a possible third wave of the pandemic.","Pellegrino, Giovanni; Ravenna, Federico; Züllig, Gabriel",Oxf. bull. econ. stat,934,1

Um total de 10.080 ovos de galinhas de 42 semanas de idade, coletados dos ninhos, foi distribuído de maneira aleatória em delineamento em bloco ao acaso, entre os seguintes tratamentos: fumigação com paraformaldeído (13,33g/m3/20 min), fumigação com ozônio (5-10ppm/20 min), irradiação de luz UV-C (254nm; 6,36 mW/cm2; 60 s), pulverização com peróxido de hidrogênio (1,56%; 0,69ml/ovo), pulverização com ácido peracético (0,13%; 0,69ml/ovo), pulverização com água (0,69ml/ovo; controle úmido) e sem desinfecção (controle seco). Oito amostras com quatros ovos cada foram coletadas para contagem de Enterobacteriaceae e bactérias mesófilas aeróbicas totais presentes na casca dos ovos antes e após o momento de desinfecção em cada tratamento. Um total de 24 ovos por grupo foi coletado para avaliações da espessura e resistência da casca. Ao todo, 1.152 ovos de cada tratamento foram incubados, em 12 bandejas de 96 ovos cada, para avaliação dos percentuais de perda de dos ovos durante a incubação, eclodibilidade, eclodibilidade de ovos férteis, mortalidade embrionária (inicial, intermediária e final), peso dos pintos e percentual de pintos vendáveis ao nascimento. A avaliação das contagens de Enterobacteriaceae e bactérias mesófilas aeróbicas totais no saco vitelínico foram realizadas em 13 pintos de um dia de idade, oriundos de cada tratamento. Nenhuma diferença significativa entre os grupos foi encontrada para a contagem de Enterobacteriaceae e bactérias mesófilas aeróbicas totais na casca dos ovos antes da desinfecção (P>0,05). Após a aplicação dos tratamentos, a contagem de Enterobacteriaceae também não foi afetada pelos tratamentos (P>0,05). Somente os ovos dos grupos desinfetados com paraformaldeído e UV apresentaram significativa redução das contagens de bactérias aeróbicas totais quando comparados ao grupo controle e a esses mesmos grupos antes da desinfecção (P<0,05), contudo essa redução foi maior (P>0,05) nos ovos fumigados com formaldeído que nos ovos irradiados com luz UV. Foi observada maior perda de peso nos ovos (P<0,05) pulverizados com peróxido de hidrogênio, ácido peracético e água, e ausência de diferença significativa (P>0,05) para essa variável entre os ovos dos tratamentos formaldeído, ozônio, UV e controle seco. As demais variáveis avaliadas nesse experimento não foram afetadas pelos tratamentos (P>0,05). Por reduzir a contagem microbiana na casca dos ovos, não prejudicar a eclodibilidade, o percentual de pintos vendáveis e os aspectos microbiológicos dos pintos de um dia, a luz UV pode ser considerada um potencial desinfetante substituto ao formaldeído para desinfecção de ovos incubáveis.","CLIMACO, WINNIE LUIZA DOS SANTOS",,934,21

At the time this article was being written, the number of infected and deceased patients continued to grow worldwide. Most patients with severe forms of the disease suffer from pneumonia and pulmonary insufficiency; in many cases, the disease is generalized and causes multiple organ failures and a dysfunction of physiological systems. One of the most serious and prognostically ominous complications from COVID-19 is coagulopathy, in particular, decompensated hypercoagulability with the risk of developing disseminated intravascular coagulation. In most cases, local and diffuse macro- and microthromboses are present, a condition which causes multiple-organ failure and thromboembolic complications. The causes and pathogenic mechanisms of coagulopathy in COVID-19 remain largely unclear, but they are associated with systemic inflammation, including the so-called cytokine storm. Despite the relatively short period of the ongoing pandemic, laboratory signs of serious hemostatic disorders have been identified and measures for specific prevention and correction of thrombosis have been developed. This review discusses the causes of COVID-19 coagulopathies and the associated complications, as well as possible approaches to their early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.","Khalirakhmanov, A.

The novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) infected individuals by binding human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor. ACE2 is widely expressed in multiple organs including respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive and urinary systems in healthy individuals. These tissues with high expression level of ACE2 seemed to be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, it has been reported that patients with tumors were likely to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and indicated poor prognosis. Methods The tissue atlas database and the blood atlas were used to analyze the distribution of ACE2 in human tissues or organs of cancers and normal samples. Starbase dataset was applied to predict the prognosis of cancers according to expression level of ACE2. Results In this study, we demonstrated a landscape profiling analysis on expression level of ACE2 in pan-cancers and showed the risky of different type of cancers to SARS-CoV-2 according to the expression level of ACE2. In addition, we found that ACE2 was both differential expression and related to the prognosis only in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC). Relative high expression of ACE2 indicated a favorable prognosis in LIHC, but they might be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions We indeed emphasized that LIHC patients with high expression level of ACE2 should be more cautious of the virus infection. Our study might provide a potential clue for preventing infection of SARS-CoV-2 in cancers.","Dai, Yu-Jun; Hu, Fang; Li, Huan; Huang, Han-Ying; Wang, Da-Wei; Liang, Yang",Annals of translational medicine,934,32
