3271,Suffering a Loss Is Good Fortune: Myth or Reality?,2017-11-29,"We sometimes decide to take an offered option that results in apparent loss (e.g., unpaid overtime). Mainstream decision theory does not predict or explain this as a choice we want to make, whereas such a choice has long been described and highly regarded by the traditional Chinese dogma “吃亏是福” (suffering a loss is good fortune). To explore what makes the dogma work, we developed a celebrity anecdote‐based scale to measure “Chikui” (suffering a loss) likelihood and found that:(i) people with higher scores on the Chikui Likelihood Scale (CLS) were more likely to report higher scores on subjective well‐being and the Socioeconomic Index for the present and (ii) the current Socioeconomic Index could be positively predicted not only by current CLS scores but also by retrospective CLS scores recalled for the past, and the predictive effect was enhanced with increasing time intervals. Our findings suggest that “suffering a loss is good fortune” is not a myth but a certain reality. © 2017 The Authors Journal of Behavioral Decision Making Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Zhao, Cui‐Xia; Shen, Si‐Chu; Rao, Li‐Lin; Zheng, Rui; Liu, Huan; Li, Shu",J Behav Decis Mak,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6033005/,404
5460,‘System Destroys Trust?’—Regulatory Institutions and Public Perceptions of Food Risks in Taiwan,2009-05-12,"West Nile virus (WNV) was first detected in the western hemisphere during the summer of 1999, reawakening US public awareness of the potential severity of vector-borne pathogens. Since its New World introduction, WNV has caused disease in human, avian, and mammalian communities across the continent. American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) are a highly susceptible WNV host and when modeled appropriately, changes in crow abundances can serve as a proxy for the spatio-temporal presence of WNV. We use the dramatic declines in abundance of this avian host to examine spatio-temporal heterogeneity in WNV intensity across the northeastern US, where WNV was first detected. Using data from the Breeding Bird Survey, we identify significant declines in crow abundance after WNV emergence that are associated with lower forest cover, more urban land use, and warmer winter temperatures. Importantly, we document continued declines as WNV was present in an area over consecutive years. Our findings support the urban-pathogen link that human WNV incidence studies have shown. For each 1% increase in urban land cover we expect an additional 5% decline in the log crow abundance beyond the decline attributed to WNV in undeveloped areas. We also demonstrate a significant relationship between above-average winter temperatures and WNV-related declines in crow abundance. The mechanisms behind these patterns remain uncertain and hypotheses requiring further research are suggested. In particular, a strong positive relationship between urban land cover and winter temperatures may confound mechanistic understanding, especially when a temperature-sensitive vector is involved.","LaDeau, Shannon L.; Calder, Catherine A.; Doran, Patrick J.; Marra, Peter P.",Ecol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089484/,404
5672,Policy processes sans frontières: interactions in transnational governance of global health,2020-02-26,"Mayaro virus (MAYV) is endemic in South American countries where it is responsible for sporadic outbreaks of acute febrile illness. The hallmark of MAYV infection is a highly debilitating and chronic arthralgia. Although MAYV emergence is a potential threat, there are no specific therapies or licensed vaccine. In this study, we developed a murine model of MAYV infection that emulates many of the most relevant clinical features of the infection in humans and tested a live-attenuated MAYV vaccine candidate (MAYV/IRES). Intraplantar inoculation of a WT strain of MAYV into immunocompetent mice induced persistent hypernociception, transient viral replication in target organs, systemic production of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and specific humoral IgM and IgG responses. Inoculation of MAYV/IRES in BALB/c mice induced strong specific cellular and humoral responses. Moreover, MAYV/IRES vaccination of immunocompetent and interferon receptor-defective mice resulted in protection from disease induced by the virulent wt MAYV strain. Thus, this study describes a novel model of MAYV infection in immunocompetent mice and highlights the potential role of a live-attenuated MAYV vaccine candidate in host’s protection from disease induced by a virulent MAYV strain.","Mota, Mânlio Tasso de Oliveira; Costa, Vivian Vasconcelos; Sugimoto, Michelle Amantéa; Guimarães, Georgia de Freitas; Queiroz-Junior, Celso Martins; Moreira, Thaiane Pinto; de Sousa, Carla Daiane; Santos, Franciele Martins; Queiroz, Victoria Fulgêncio; Passos, Ingredy; Hubner, Josy; Souza, Danielle Gloria; Weaver, Scott C.; Teixeira, Mauro Martins; Nogueira, Maurício Lacerda",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7093544/,404
11586,The effects of inequality on total factor productivity across districts in South Africa: a spatial econometric analysis,2020-05-15,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of visual impairment in the developed country, is characterized by vascular lesions and neuronal damage of the retina. Treatment options for this condition are currently limited. The advent of therapy targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) demonstrated significant benefits to patients with DR. However, this treatment is limited by its short half-life and requirement for frequent invasive intravitreal injections. In addition, many patients failed to achieve clinically significant improvement in visual function. Gene therapy has the potential to provide an alternative treatment for DR with distinct advantages, such as longer therapeutic effect, less injection frequency, ability to intervene at disease onset, and potentially fewer side effects. RECENT FINDINGS: Strategies for gene therapy in DR, stemming from the current understanding of the disease pathogenesis, focus on the inhibition of neovascularization and protection of neurovascular degeneration in the retina. Studies with promising results have mainly focussed on animal models due to efficacy and safety concerns, despite a number of successful preclinical studies using adeno-associated virus-mediated transduction to treat both vascular dysfunction and neuronal degeneration. With the optimization of delivery vectors, transgene regulation, and outcome measure, gene therapy will potentially become available for patients with DR. SUMMARY: This review provides an update on the current strategies utilized in DR gene therapy research. Several barriers to the clinical application of gene therapy for DR are highlighted, and future directions for this research are proposed.","Wang, Jiang-Hui; Roberts, Georgina Eloise; Liu, Guei-Sheung",Curr Diab Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7228867/,404

16520,Using self and peer video annotations of simulated patient encounters in communication training to facilitate the reflection of communication skills: an implementation study,2021-03-15,"Fetal heart sound is an important part of fetal monitoring and has attracted extensive research and attention from scholars at home and abroad in recent years. The fetal heart rate, extracted from the fetal heart sound signal, is one of the important indicators that reflect the health of the fetus in the womb. In this study, a maternal-fetal Holter monitor based on f ECG technology was used to collect maternal heart rate, fetal heart rate, and uterine contractions signals, isolate the fetal heart rate, and design an algorithm to extract the fetal heart rate baseline, acceleration, variation, wake-up cycle, and nonlinear parameters. Using statistical methods to analyze the average value and range of various characteristic parameters of fetal heart rate under continuous long-term monitoring, the results show that the baseline has a downward trend from 10 o'clock in the night to 4 o'clock in the morning and is the lowest around 2 o'clock in the morning. The area and acceleration time were significantly higher than those in the suspicious group. However, there was no significant difference in the number of acceleration values between the two groups; the proportion of small mutations in the normal group was lower than that of the suspicious group and the proportion of medium mutations was higher than that of the suspicious group. There is no statistically significant difference in maternal age, gestational age at childbirth, pregnancy comorbidities, and complication rates in the five-level interpretation system of ACOG (2009), RCOG (2007), SOGC (2007), and the United States (2007). The difference of pregnancy and parity in various images was statistically significant, P < 0.05. The second type of fetal heart rate monitoring images appeared in the highest among the diagnostic standards, and the difference in the second type of fetal heart rate monitoring images between the various diagnostic standards was statistically significant, P ≤ 0.001.","Yang, Xuan; Zhang, Ke; He, Jianhu",J Healthc Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8007337/,404

Therefore, ACAP2 and miR-532 may interact with each other to participate in MI. Plasma samples from both patients with MI (n = 65) and healthy controls (n = 65) were subjected to RNA extractions and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction to analyze the expression of ACAP2, mature miR-532, and premature miR-532. Correlations among them were analyzed by Pearson's correlation coefficient. Expression of both mature miR-532 and premature miR-532 in cardiomyocytes with ACAP2 overexpression was analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction to study the effects of ACAP2 overexpression on the maturation of miR-532. The role of ACAP2 and miR-532 in regulating the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes induced by hypoxia was analyzed by cell apoptosis assay. In this study, we found that ACAP2 and mature miR-532 were both upregulated in plasma from patients with MI. ACAP2 and mature miR-532 were inversely correlated, whereas ACAP2 and premature miR-532 were not significantly correlated. In cardiomyocytes, overexpression of ACAP2 increased the expression of mature miR-532, but not premature miR-532. Cell apoptosis analysis showed that ACAP2 and miR-532 overexpression promoted the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes induced by hypoxia treatment. In addition, miR-532 inhibitor reduced the effects of ACAP2 overexpression. ACAP2 is overexpressed in MI and may promote the maturation of miR-532 to induce the apoptosis of cardiomyocyte.","Zhang, Jun; Tang, Yanrong; Zhang, Jing; Wang, Jing; He, Jiyun; Zhang, Zhenzhen; Liu, Fuqiang",J Cardiovasc Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8340945/,404

20820,"Introducing the Microbes and Social Equity Working Group: Considering the Microbial Components of Social, Environmental, and Health Justice",2021-07-27,"The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze (18)F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT) metabolic variables, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) tumor expression, and other factors as predictors of disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) (stage IA–IIIA) who underwent surgical resection. We still lack predictor of immune checkpoint (programmed cell death-1 [PD-1]/PD-L1) inhibitors. Herein, we investigated the correlation between metabolic parameters from (18)F-FDG PET/CT and PD-L1 expression in patients with surgically resected LUAD. Seventy-four patients who underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT prior to treatment were consecutively enrolled. The main (18)F-FDG PET/CT-derived variables were primary tumor maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG). Surgical tumor specimens were analyzed for PD-L1 and p-STAT3 expression using immunohistochemistry. Correlations between immunohistochemistry results and (18)F-FDG PET/CT-derived variables were compared. Associations of PD-L1 and p-STAT3 tumor expression, (18)F-FDG PET/CT-derived variables, and other factors with DFS in resected LUAD were evaluated. All tumors were FDG-avid. The cutoff values of low and high SUVmax, MTV, and TLG were 12.60, 14.87, and 90.85, respectively. The results indicated that TNM stage, PD-L1 positivity, and high (18)F-FDG PET/CT metabolic volume parameters (TLG ≥90.85 or MTV ≥14.87) were independent predictors of worse DFS in resected LUAD. No (18)F-FDG metabolic parameters associated with PD-L1 expression were observed (chi-square test), but we found that patients with positive PD-L1 expression have significantly higher SUVmax (P = .01), MTV (P = .00), and TLG (P = .00) than patients with negative PD-L1 expression. (18)F-FDG PET/CT metabolic volume parameters (TLG ≥90.85 or MTV ≥14.87) were more helpful in prognostication than the conventional parameter (SUVmax), PD-L1 expression was an independent predictor of DFS in patients with resected LUAD. Metabolic parameters on (18)F-FDG PET/CT have a potential role for (18)F-FDG PET/CT in selecting candidate LUAD for treatment with checkpoint inhibitors.","Wang, Dalong; Li, Yingci; Chen, Xiaolin; Li, Ping",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8415941/,404

35865,The state of South African media: a space to contest democracy,2020-07-02,"Asymmetric-choice workflow nets (ACWF-nets) are an important subclass of workflow nets (WF-nets) that can model and analyse business processes of many systems, especially the interactions among multiple processes. Soundness of WF-nets is a basic property guaranteeing that these business processes are deadlock-/livelock-free and each designed action has a potential chance to be executed. Aalst et al. proved that the soundness problem is decidable for general WF-nets and proposed a polynomial algorithm to check the soundness for free-choice workflow nets (FCWF-nets) that are a special subclass of ACWF-nets. Tiplea et al. proved that for safe acyclic WF-nets the soundness problem is co-NP-complete, and we proved that for safe WF-nets the soundness problem is PSPACE-complete. We also proved that for safe ACWF-nets the soundness problem is co-NP-hard, but this paper sharpens this result by proving that for safe ACWF-nets this problem is PSPACE-complete actually. This paper provides a polynomial-time reduction from the acceptance problem of linear bounded automata (LBA) to the soundness problem of safe ACWF-nets. The kernel of the reduction is to guarantee that an LBA with an input string does not accept the input string if and only if the constructed safe ACWF-net is sound. Based on our reduction, we easily prove that the liveness problem of safe AC-nets is also PSPACE-complete, but the best result on this problem was NP-hardness provided by Ohta and Tsuji. Therefore, we also strengthen their result.","Liu, Guanjun",Application and Theory of Petri Nets and Concurrency,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7324217/,404

40680,Religious Leaders in Politics: Rio de Janeiro Under the Mayor-Bishop in the Times of the Pandemic,2020-10-09,"Since the early months of the COVID-19 epidemic, a large number of scientific papers have considered the possibility that healthcare professionals (HCWs) were affected by depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and psychological distress. The abundance of research has also made it possible to produce several systematic reviews and meta-analyzes. All the studies retrieved in these reviews, however, were cross-sectional. Depressive symptoms and anxiety in HCWs were compared to “normal values”, administrative staff, or external sample; moreover, some studies had no control group. No longitudinal study has been produced so far. Some studies had negative results. Overall, there is still little evidence of an increase in mental health problems and sleep disturbances in HCWs during the outbreak. To fill this gap, we investigated the mental health of workers who have been monitored for many years in an Italian local health unit. Mental health was investigated with standardized questionnaires. 82 HCWs who tested positive at the COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab, 152 exposed workers who tested negative and 361 unexposed controls participated in the survey. Anxiety was reported by 16.6% of COVID-19 cases and depression by 20.3%, with a significant increase in the estimated risk (OR = 4.3; CI95%=2.4-7.4 for anxiety, OR = 3.5; CI95% =2.0-6.0 for depression). In test-positive cases, sleep was a significant moderating factor in the relationship between occupational stress or PJ and anxiety. Exposed, negative HCWS also had an increased OR for anxiety (1.84, CI95% 1.1-3.1) and depression (2.2 CI95% 1.4-3.5). The frequency of anxiety and depression disorders in the population examined was not higher than that recorded in the years preceding the epidemic during periodic occupational health checks in the workplace. Mental health support and organizational interventions must mainly concern workers with positive tests and should also tend to improve sleep quality. KEY MESSAGES: Health care workers who have had unprotected exposure to COVID-19 patients, and even more those who have contracted the infection, have sleep problems, anxiety and depression. The psychological support intervention for health care workers should include the promotion of sleep hygiene.","Magnavita, N; Di Prinzio, R R; Chirico, F; Sacco, A; Quintavalle, G",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543502/,404
41905,"Sport-tech diplomacy: exploring the intersections between the sport-tech ecosystem, innovation, and diplomacy in Israel",2020-11-10,"CASE REPORT - INTRODUCTION: There is limited evidence on the outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases. Since severe COVID-19 is characterised by hyperinflammation, the effects of a pre-existing inflammatory state and immunomodulatory treatments on the disease’s course are of great interest. Even though patients in this group are perceived of being at higher risk for severe disease, most of the relevant observational studies have had controversial results. We aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with a history of rheumatic disease and COVID-19 related admission in our centre. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: We conducted a retrospective observational study of COVID-19 RT-PCR positive admissions of patients coded as having rheumatic disease in the Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust between April 1st and June 24(th), 2020. Data were extracted from the patient clinical notes and electronic medical records and were captured and analysed on MS Excel. Among 613 COVID-19 related admissions, 19 (3.1%) patients were coded as having comorbid rheumatic disease. 8 cases were excluded from further analysis as, upon records review, they had osteoarthritis or a history of gout. Thus, the true incidence of comorbid rheumatic disease among COVID-19 related hospitalisations was even lower at 11/613 (1.8%). The mean age of the patients was 80.5 ± 8.06 years, 9/11 (81.8%) were female and 8/11 (73%) were Caucasian. In the vast majority the diagnosis was that of Rheumatoid Arthritis (9/11, 81.8%), while one patient had Polymyalgia Rheumatica and another Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Only a quarter of the patients had moderate (2, 18%) or high (1, 9%) disease activity on their most recent outpatient visit. In terms of antirheumatic medication, 5 (45%) patients were on regular Prednisolone (20% <5mg, 80% 5-10mg), 8 (72%) were on cs DMARDs and only 1 (9%) on bDMARDs. A substantial proportion of the patient cohort also suffered with other comorbidities. 8/11 (72.7%) patients had arterial hypertension, 5 (45.4%) had a history of cardiovascular disease, 3 (27.3%) obesity (BMI 30+), 3 (27.3%) previous history of cancer, 2 (18.2%) COPD, 2 (18.2%) CKD, 1 (9%) Interstitial lung disease, 1 (9%) Diabetes, 1 (9%) Cerebrovascular disease and 1 (9%) immunodeficiency. During their admission, 7 (63.6%) patients required supplemental oxygen therapy. Unfortunately, 5/11 (45.5%) patients had a fatal outcome. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: In our cohort, the percentage of patients with rheumatic diseases among inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 infection was low (∼1.8%). Potential explanations for this observation could be a beneficial effect of concomitant antirheumatic treatment (steroids and/or DMARDs) in controlling hyperinflammation, but also rheumatic disease patients’ increased risk awareness and thus increased compliance with viral spread mitigation measures (‘shielding’) as per Government guidelines. We also note the low rate of biologic DMARD use with only 1 (9%) inpatient having received Rituximab for RA. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: The incidence of rheumatic disease among COVID-19 related admissions in our centre was exceptionally low. Per recently published reports from worldwide registries, older age and multiple comorbidities appear to drive the risk for hospitalisation, need for oxygen supplementation and fatal outcome. Better understanding of the effect of DMARDs on COVID-19 severity requires further investigation, perhaps with SARS-CoV-2 antibody studies, but our observations appear to be reassuring.","Cheila, Myrto; Elrashid, Ali; Erb, Nicola; Douglas, Karen; Koutsianas, Christos",Rheumatol Adv Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607338/,404

These changes can be attributed to fears of virus transmission as well as federal, state and local government mitigation strategies resulting in social distancing and quarantining limiting caregiving interactions. This qualitative investigation conducted 55 Zoom interviews over summer 2020 with family caregivers to explore their changing roles and duties during the pandemic. Researchers utilized a semi-structured interview guide to explore caregiver experiences with COVID-19. The average age of the caregiver participants was 59 and the average age of the care recipients for whom they provided care was 74. All participants provided unpaid care for family members. Interviews were conducted in English (n=40), Spanish (n=5), Somali (n=5) and Korean (n=5). Care recipients resided in a facility (nursing home, memory care, ICF-DD, or other assisted living) (70%) with the caregiver (20%), and in a separate independent setting (10%).

43855,Job Demands and Resources Experienced by the Early Childhood Education Workforce Serving High-Need Populations,2021-01-05,"BACKGROUND: Numerous research studies have identified specific human gene variants that affect enhanced susceptibility to viral infections. More recently is the current pandemic where the SARS-CoV-2 infection has shown a high degree of person-to-person clinical variability. A wide range of disease severity occurs in the patients’ experiences, from asymptomatic cases, mild infections to serious life threatening conditions requiring admission into the intensive care unit (ICU). MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: Although, it is generally reported that age and co-morbidities contribute significantly to the variations in the clinical outcome of the scourge of COVID-19, a hypothetical question of the possibility of genetic involvement in the susceptibility and severity of the disease arose when some unique severe outcomes were seen among young patients with no co-morbidity. The role human genetics play in clinical response to the viral infections is scarcely understood; however, several ongoing researches all around the world are currently focusing on possible genetic factors. This review reports the possible genetic factors that have been widely studied in defining the severity of viral infections using SARS-CoV-2 as a case study. These involve the possible involvements of ACE2, HLA, and TLR genes such as TLR7 and TLR3 in the presentation of a more severe condition. SHORT CONCLUSION: Understanding these variations could help to inform efforts to identify people at increased risk of infection outbreaks through genetic diagnosis of infections by locating disease genes or mutations that predispose patients to severe infection. This will also suggest specific targets for therapy and prophylaxis.","Oladejo, Babayemi Olawale; Adeboboye, Covenant Femi; Adebolu, Tinuola Tokunbo",Egypt J Med Hum Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7773422/,404

47622,Public-Private Partnerships for Infrastructure and Service Delivery: An Introduction,2021-03-18,"Identifying cases of contagious disease and following any chains of transmission from them is a mainstay of public health efforts to stop disease spread. This method of surveillance is ineffective, however, if people cannot be found or refuse to reveal contacts. It also declines in efficacy as disease spreads widely in a community or is transmitted in ways such as aerolisization that may make it difficult to recognize that contacts have occurred. This chapter considers the ethics of contact tracing, arguing that the method has far too often been associated with moral condemnation of behaviours such as non-marital sex or with stigmatization of groups. The chapter then explores how contact tracing can be combined with treatment and other support to facilitate warranted trust in the use of this traditional surveillance method.","Francis, John G.; Francis, Leslie P.",Sustaining Surveillance: The Importance of Information for Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972149/,404

It deals with the cooperation amongst and in such teams as well as the resulting formation of relationship networks—called figurations. The research focuses on blue-collar workers. A situational individual case study from the field of storage and distribution work analyzes the relationship networks between team leaders and team members and the extent to which culture influences cooperation. A figurative-analytical perspective—mainly based on the study “The Established and the Outsiders” by Elias and Scotson (1994)— is applied to shed light on the above-mentioned phenomena and to reveal interrelations. Within the framework of a qualitative research design, guided by the grounded theory methodology, eleven interviews and six days of participatory observation were conducted in order to derive a theory of a permeable unified storage culture based on elaborated core categories, which leads to a unification of differences in digitalized work contexts. Furthermore, the findings show that the increasing digitalized structures in the observed company supports this. Simultaneously, this storage culture impacts the exposed established outsider figuration, but is influenced by it in an analogous manner.","Bardmann, Mona-Maria",Digital Supply Chains and the Human Factor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980954/,404

In the digital world, an example of an innovative learning tool is digital games. Digital game learning (DGBL) is a smart pedagogical approach that utilises digital games. DGBL has a prominent place in learning technologies due to the potentiality of games to engage students, enabling them to effortlessly reach the edges of their competencies, skills, and knowledge. Teachers, students and games per se constitute important agents for the successful and effective implementation of DGBL. In this context, our research was extended to cover the study of teachers’ and students’ perceptions of DGBL. More specifically, the purpose of this research was to examine the pre-service teachers’ perceptions of the barriers to DGBL implementation. To that end, an online survey with closed-ended questions and one open-ended question was conducted. In this paper, we present the answers to the open-ended question. Quantitative and qualitative data processing and analysis were carried out. According to the pre-service teachers’ responses, it is concluded that a major obstacle is the inefficient allocation of available financial resources. Resources are required for the supply of up-to-date equipment, devices and educational software, as well as for the professional development and training of teachers, school administrators and policymakers. Utilizing easy-to-use and inexpensive devices, which most teachers and even students hold, is the answer to the hurdle called “lack of equipment”. Therefore, the implementation of the DGBL, as a smart and innovative pedagogical approach, is primarily a matter of political will to curriculum reform based on ongoing research into appropriate digital learning materials.","Kaimara, Polyxeni; Fokides, Emmanuel; Oikonomou, Andreas; Deliyannis, Ioannis",Tech Know Learn,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8024674/,404
52271,Healthcare professionals diagnosed by COVID-19 at work: The right for it to be classified as an occupational disease(),2021-04-30,"After the World War II, every country throughout the world is experiencing the biggest crisis induced by the devastating Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which initially arose in the city of Wuhan in December 2019. This global pandemic has severely affected not only the health of billions of people but also the economy of countries all over the world. It has been evident that novel virus has infected a total of 20,674,903 lives as on 12 August 2020. The dissemination of the virus can be regulated by detecting the positive COVID cases as soon as possible. The reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the basic approach used in the identification of the COVID-19. As RT-PCR is less sensitive to determine the novel virus at the beginning stage, it is worthwhile to develop more robust and other diagnosis approaches for the detection of the novel coronavirus. Due to the accessibility of medical datasets comprising of radiography images publicly, more robust diagnosis approaches are contributed by the researchers and technocrats for the identification of COVID-19 images using the techniques of deep leaning. In this paper, we proposed VGG16 and MobileNet-V2, which makes use of ADAM and RMSprop optimizers for the automatic identification of the COVID-19 images from other pneumonia chest X-ray images. Then, the efficiency of the proposed methodology has been enhanced by the application of data augmentation and transfer learning approach which is used to overcome the overfitting problem. From the experimental outcomes, it can be deduced that the proposed MobileNet-V2 model using ADAM and RMSprop optimizer achieves better accomplishment in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity when contrasted with the VGG 16 using ADAM and RMSprop optimizers.","Swapnarekha, H.; Behera, Himansu Sekhar; Roy, Debanik; Das, Sunanda; Nayak, Janmenjoy",J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8080211/,404

57316,The Language We Use: Providers’ Perceptions About Families,2021-09-02,"STUDY QUESTION: Could telemedicine help in the management of the infertile couple’s path at a fertility center? SUMMARY ANSWER: The introduction of telemedicine increased the number of cycles within 6 months from the first consultation and reduced the drop-out rate. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In Italy during the complete lockdown due to the first pandemic wave of SARS-CoV–2 the activity of fertility centers were stopped, with the exception of fertility preservation procedures for oncological patients. We therefore proposed a service of telemedicine to our patients, that we called SmartPMA. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A longitudinal study performed at a public infertility center. The SmartPMA service was offered to 93 couples referred to our center from March 9th to May 31st, 2020. Initially 72 couples was interested in SmartPMA. Our center gradually re-opened and the first oocytes retrieval was performed on June 9th . PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Sixty-one out of 72 couples (85%) performed the SmartPMA from April 7th to June 16th, 2020. After acquiring informed consent and sending two anamnestic questionnaires, we booked a video-consultation with a gynecologist and a biologist. Afterwards, we sent medical prescriptions for appropriate clinical tests. At the re-opening, we offered the chance to start the ART cycle. Time to the first treatment and drop-out rates were compared to historical controls (2017–2019) using chi-square test. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Eleven couples declined the SmartPMA and booked an appointment at the reopening. Only 2 of these couples (18%) actually performed an IVF treatment within six months. Three out the 61 couples that accepted the SmartPMA did not perform IVF treatments because the age of women exceeded the legal limit to access to a public ART center. Twelve out of 58 couples (21%) did not performed any IVF treatment for the following reasons: 4 women spontaneously got pregnant, 1 couple gave up for medical reasons, 3 were referred to ovodonation, and 4 were lost to follow-up. Thirty-eight out of 58 couples (66%) (median age of woman: 36 + 4 years, range 27–43) performed at least one ART treatment (14 IUI, 12 ICSI cycle, 12 FIVET cycle). Eight out of 58 couples (14%) needed further clinical tests and their treatments are ongoing. The mean time to first treatment in the SmartPMA couples was 4 + 1 months (range 1–6). After SmartPMA, 66% of the couples performed the first cycle within 6 months, compared to 37% of controls (333/898 couples at their first access to our center from 2017 to 2019), p < 0.00001. The drop-out was reduced from 39% to 20%, p = 0 .0038. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: We cannot exclude that the couples that joined the SmartPMA service during the pandemic period were particularly motivated to perform IVF treatments. We are aware of the small sample size and that this is a monocentric study. Wider implications of the findings: Even after the pandemic, telemedicine can be an useful tool for fertility centers to reduce the discomfort of several visits in hospital, without losing patients but rather ultimately reducing the time to treatments and drop-out.

A scientific evaluation of the project in Baden-Württemberg, Germany was commissioned in 2019 by the Regional Center of Nutrition Baden-Württemberg at the State Authority for Agriculture, Nutrition and Rural Affairs Baden-Württemberg, Germany. OBJECTIVES: The method-integrative evaluation was concluded with a Delphi process in which consensual recommendations for action to optimize the catering offer in daycare centers and elementary schools were identified. For this purpose, experts were asked for their opinions on the quality of the catering offer, the networking of relevant actors, formal nutritional education and the structural integration of the catering offer (informal learning). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A three-stage online Delphi method was carried out. In two survey rounds, the experts (practitioners involved in the project and external scientists) were interviewed in a standardized way. This was followed by an online workshop in which dissenting opinions from the previous surveys were openly discussed with the experts and possible backgrounds were investigated. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The experts agree that a health-promoting catering offer in daycare centers and schools is essential for informal learning in the field of nutrition and should be linked to formal nutritional education. For the implementation, they see a central role in the daycare and school management and fixed contact persons in the respective facilities. The experts see a need for action in sensitization, participation, and training of various actors as well as in the expansion of support services for daycare centers and elementary schools.","Niederberger, Marlen; Nowitzki-Grimm, Susanne; Werner, Lisa; Schleicher, Katja; Lührmann, Petra",Pr&#x000e4;v Gesundheitsf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8443114/,404

76329,Video Consultation Consumer Home-based Assessment Tool (VC-CHAT).,2020-07-22,"As the receptor-binding protein of herpes simplex virus (HSV), gD plays an essential role in virus entry. In its native state, the last 56 amino acids of the ectodomain C terminus (C-term) occlude binding to its receptors, herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) and nectin-1. Although it is clear that movement of the C-term must occur to permit receptor binding, we believe that this conformational change is also a key event for triggering later steps leading to fusion. Specifically, gD mutants containing disulfide bonds that constrain the C-term are deficient in their ability to trigger fusion following receptor binding. In this report, we show that two newly made monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), MC2 and MC5, have virus-neutralizing activity but do not block binding of gD to either receptor. In contrast, all previously characterized neutralizing anti-gD MAbs block binding of gD to a receptor(s). Interestingly, instead of blocking receptor binding, MC2 significantly enhances the affinity of gD for both receptors. Several nonneutralizing MAbs (MC4, MC10, and MC14) also enhanced gD-receptor binding. While MC2 and MC5 recognized different epitopes on the core of gD, these nonneutralizing MAbs recognized the gD C-term. Both the neutralizing capacity and rate of neutralization of virus by MC2 are uniquely enhanced when MC2 is combined with MAb MC4, MC10, or MC14. We suggest that MC2 and MC5 prevent gD from performing a function that triggers later steps leading to fusion and that the epitope for MC2 is normally occluded by the C-term of the gD ectodomain.","Lazear, Eric; Whitbeck, J Charles; Ponce-de-Leon, Manuel; Cairns, Tina M; Willis, Sharon H; Zuo, Yi; Krummenacher, Claude; Cohen, Gary H; Eisenberg, Roselyn J",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.06480-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22130533/,404

The developed nanocomposite was characterized through the infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analyses. The ternary nanocomposite coating offers the good mechanical and thermal stability and high extraction efficiency thanks to its large specific surface. A central composite statistical design was used to study the main variables affecting the extraction efficiency. Afterwards, to study the relationship between different input and output variables as well as to identify the optimal operating conditions, response surface methodology was used, whereby a second-order polynomial equation was fit to the experimental data. The optimized extraction conditions were as follows: temperature, 70°C; extraction time, 15 min; and concentration of NaCl, 5%w/v. Detection limit of 0.12 ng mL-1 was obtained at the optimized extraction conditions, and the calibration plot was linear in the concentration range of 0.30-200 ng mL-1 .

79107,Predictors of successful weaning in patients requiring extremely prolonged mechanical ventilation.,2020,"BACKGROUND Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) may confer the protection in critical organs. The authors hypothesized that limb RIPC would reduce lung injury in patients undergoing pulmonary resection. METHODS In a randomized, prospective, parallel, controlled trial, 216 patients undergoing elective thoracic pulmonary resection under one-lung ventilation with propofol-remifentanil anesthesia were randomized 1:1 to receive either limb RIPC or conventional lung resection (control). Three cycles of 5-min ischemia/5-min reperfusion induced by a blood pressure cuff served as RIPC stimulus. The primary outcome was PaO2/FIO2. Secondary outcomes included other pulmonary variables, the incidence of in-hospital complications, markers of oxidative stress, and inflammatory response. RESULTS Limb RIPC significantly increased PaO2/FIO2 compared with control at 30 and 60 min after one-lung ventilation, 30 min after re-expansion, and 6 h after operation (238 ± 52 vs. 192 ± 67, P = 0.03; 223 ± 66 vs. 184 ± 64, P = 0.01; 385 ± 61 vs. 320 ± 79, P = 0.003; 388 ± 52 vs. 317 ± 46, P = 0.001, respectively). In comparison with control, it also significantly reduced serum levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after operation and malondialdehyde levels at 60 min after one-lung ventilation and 30 min after re-expansion (all P < 0.01). The incidence of acute lung injury and the length of postoperative hospital stay were markedly reduced by limb RIPC compared with control (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Limb RIPC attenuates acute lung injury via improving intraoperative pulmonary oxygenation in patients without severe pulmonary disease after lung resection under propofol-remifentanil anesthesia.","Li, Cai; Xu, Miao; Wu, Yan; Li, Yun-Sheng; Huang, Wen-Qi; Liu, Ke-Xuan",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000000266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743579/,404

84435,Multiple COVID-19 Risk Factors Increase the Likelihood of Experiencing Anxiety Symptoms in Canada.,2020-08-13,"BACKGROUND The opioid-related overdose epidemic remains a persistent public health problem in the United States and has been accelerated by the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic. Existing, evidence-based treatment options for opioid use disorder (OUD) are broadly underutilized, particularly by people experiencing homelessness (PEH). PEH are also more likely to misuse and overdose on opioids. To better understand current gaps and disparities in OUD treatment experienced by PEH and efforts to address them, we synthesized the literature reporting on the intersection of housing status and OUD treatment. METHODS We conducted a scoping review of the literature from the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science Core Collection. We included studies describing treatment-related outcomes specific to PEH and articles assessing OUD treatment interventions tailored to this population. Relevant findings were compiled via thematic analysis and narratively synthesized. RESULTS 60 articles met our inclusion criteria, including 43 descriptive and 17 intervention-focused studies. These studies demonstrated that PEH experience more barriers to OUD treatment than their housed counterparts and access inpatient and detoxification treatment more commonly than pharmacotherapy. However, the reviewed literature indicated that PEH have similar outcomes once engaged in pharmacotherapy. Efficacious interventions for PEH were low-barrier and targeted, with housing interventions also demonstrating benefit. CONCLUSIONS PEH have diminished access to evidence-based OUD treatment, particularly medications, and require targeted approaches to improve engagement and retention. To mitigate the disproportionate opioid-related morbidity and mortality PEH experience, innovative, flexible, and interdisciplinary OUD treatment models are necessary, with housing support playing an important role.","McLaughlin, Matthew F; Li, Rick; Carrero, Nicolás Domínguez; Bain, Paul A; Chatterjee, Avik",Drug and alcohol dependence,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108717; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33985863/,404
86012,Using informatics to improve cancer surveillance.,2020-09-15,"BACKGROUND Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that shows as erythematous and scaly lesions. The pathogenesis of psoriasis is driven by a dysregulation of the immune system which leads to an altered cytokine production. Proinflammatory cytokines that are up-regulated in psoriasis include tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin-12 (IL-12), and IL-23 for which monoclonal antibodies have already been approved for clinical use. We have previously documented the therapeutic applicability of targeting TNFα mRNA for RNA interference-mediated down-regulation by anti-TNFα small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) delivered by lentiviral vectors to xenografted psoriatic skin. The present report aims at targeting mRNA encoding the shared p40 subunit (IL-12B) of IL-12 and IL-23 by cellular transduction with lentiviral vectors encoding anti-IL12B shRNAs. METHODS Effective anti-IL12B shRNAs are identified among a panel of shRNAs by potency measurements in cultured cells. The efficiency and persistency of lentiviral gene delivery to xenografted human skin are investigated by bioluminescence analysis of skin treated with lentiviral vectors encoding the luciferase gene. shRNA-expressing lentiviral vectors are intradermally injected in xenografted psoriatic skin and the effects of the treatment evaluated by clinical psoriasis scoring, by measurements of epidermal thickness, and IL-12B mRNA levels. RESULTS Potent and persistent transgene expression following a single intradermal injection of lentiviral vectors in xenografted human skin is reported. Stable IL-12B mRNA knockdown and reduced epidermal thickness are achieved three weeks after treatment of xenografted psoriatic skin with lentivirus-encoded anti-IL12B shRNAs. These findings mimic the results obtained with anti-TNFα shRNAs but, in contrast to anti-TNFα treatment, anti-IL12B shRNAs do not ameliorate the psoriatic phenotype as evaluated by semi-quantitative clinical scoring and by immunohistological examination. CONCLUSIONS Our studies consolidate the properties of lentiviral vectors as a tool for potent gene delivery and for evaluation of mRNA targets for anti-inflammatory therapy. However, in contrast to local anti-TNFα treatment, the therapeutic potential of targeting IL-12B at the RNA level in psoriasis is questioned.","Bak, Rasmus O; Stenderup, Karin; Rosada, Cecilia; Petersen, Line B; Moldt, Brian; Dagnæs-Hansen, Frederik; Jakobsen, Maria; Kamp, Søren; Jensen, Thomas G; Dam, Tomas N; Mikkelsen, Jacob Giehm",BMC dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-5945-11-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21352568/,404

86347,Development of a research-oriented system for collecting mechanical ventilator waveform data.,2017,"BACKGROUND Tracheal intubation is used to establish a secure airway in patients who require mechanical ventilation. Unexpected extubation can have serious complications, including airway trauma and death. Various methods and devices have been developed to maintain endotracheal tube (ETT) security. Associated complications include pressure ulcers due to decreased tissue perfusion. Device consideration includes ease of use, rapid application, and low exerted pressure around the airway. METHODS Sixteen ETT holders were evaluated under a series of simulated clinical conditions. ETT security was tested by measuring distance displaced after a tug. Nine of the 16 methods could be evaluated for speed of moving the ETT to the opposite side of the mouth. Sensors located on a mannequin measured applied forces when the head was rotated vertically or horizontally. Data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance, with P < .05. RESULTS Median displacement of the ETT by the tug test was 0 cm (interquartile range of 0.0-0.10 cm, P < .001). The mean time to move the ETT from one side of the mouth to the other ranged from 1.25 ± 0.2 s to 34.4 ± 3.4 s (P < .001). Forces applied to the face with a vertical head lift ranged from < 0.2 newtons (N) to a maximum of 3.52 N (P < .001). Forces applied to the face with a horizontal rotation ranged from < 0.2 N to 3.52 N (P < .001). Commercial devices produced greater force than noncommercial devices. CONCLUSIONS Noncommercial airway holders exert less force on a patient's face than commercial devices. Airway stability is affected by the type of securing method. Many commercial holders allow for rapid but secure movement of the artificial airway from one side of the mouth to the other.","Fisher, Daniel F; Chenelle, Christopher T; Marchese, Andrew D; Kratohvil, Joseph P; Kacmarek, Robert M",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.02951; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24368866/,404
86760,"Suicide prevention in Japan: Government and community measures, and high-risk interventions.",2021-03-31,"Objectives: Loneliness and depression are of increasing concern in long-term care homes made more urgent by viral outbreak isolation protocols. An innovative program called Java Mentorship was developed that engaged community volunteers and resident volunteers (mentors) as a team. The team met weekly, received education, and provided visits and guidance in pairs to socially disengaged residents (mentees). The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of conducting a larger study. Method: We conducted a mixed-methods pre-post study to evaluate the program. We collected feasibility data associated with the program implementation, including assessment of the sample and ability to recruit; procedures for data collection; retention, program adherence and acceptability; and residents' responses including loneliness, depression, purpose in life, social identity and sense of belonging outcomes. We enrolled community mentors (n = 65), resident mentors (n = 48) staff facilitators (n = 24) and mentees (n = 74) in 10 Canadian sites. Results: Most feasibility objectives were met, and adherence and acceptability were high. Some resource challenges and low retention rates among resident mentors were noted. We found a 29% reduction in depression scores (p = .048; d = .30) and 15% reduction in loneliness scores (p = .014; d = .23). Purpose in life, social identity and sense of belonging were unchanged. Interviews among participants indicated high acceptability and positive perceptions of the program. Conclusion: The study findings reveal a potential role for mentorship as a viable approach to reducing loneliness and depression in long-term care settings and lay the groundwork for future research.","Theurer, Kristine A; Stone, Robyn I; Suto, Melinda J; Timonen, Virpi; Brown, Susan G; Mortenson, W Ben",Aging & mental health,https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2020.1849023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33256458/,404

METHOD The healthcare workers who use the N95 face-mask, between 30-50 years of age who have best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ≥10/10, spherical or cylindrical refraction errors less than 2 diopters, with normal intra ocular pressure (IOP), axial length (AL) between 22-24 mm included in the study. The choroid was imaged with enhanced depth imaging (EDI) techniques using SD-OCT. CT was measured, subfoveal, at 1000 μm nasal and temporal of the center of the fovea. Measurements were first made after wearing the N95 mask for at least 2 hours without removing it and repeated 15 minutes after removing. RESULTS After 2 hours of the N95 mask using without removal, the mean subfoveal CT was 293.56 ± 76.12(min:185, max:479), the mean temporal CT was 253.81 ± 63.48(min:172, max:384), the mean nasal CT was 239.18 ± 53.92(min:139, max:356). Fifteen minutes after removal of the N95 mask, the mean subfoveal CT was 250.56 ± 52.48(min:172, max:397), the mean temporal was 218.40 ± 53.58(min:129, max:354), the mean nasal CT was 210.67 ± 53.31(min:132, max:366). The differences in subfoveal, temporal and nasal CT between 2 hours of N95 mask use and 15 minutes after removal of the mask were statistically significant (p < 0.05 for each). CONCLUSION Hypercapnia due to prolonged use of the N95 mask may cause choroidal hemodynamic changes and transient increased choroidal thickness.","Karatas Durusoy, Gonul; Gumus, Gulsah; Demir, Gokhan",Photodiagnosis and photodynamic therapy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pdpdt.2021.102279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33813019/,404

The disease is caused by mutations in DMD (encoding dystrophin) that abolish the production of dystrophin in muscle. Muscles without dystrophin are more sensitive to damage, resulting in progressive loss of muscle tissue and function, in addition to cardiomyopathy. Recent studies have greatly deepened our understanding of the primary and secondary pathogenetic mechanisms. Guidelines for the multidisciplinary care for Duchenne muscular dystrophy that address obtaining a genetic diagnosis and managing the various aspects of the disease have been established. In addition, a number of therapies that aim to restore the missing dystrophin protein or address secondary pathology have received regulatory approval and many others are in clinical development.","Duan, Dongsheng; Goemans, Nathalie; Takeda, Shin'ichi; Mercuri, Eugenio; Aartsma-Rus, Annemieke",Nature reviews.

88735,"Six Steps to Achieve Meaning, Wellness, and Avoid Burnout in a Residency Program.",2020,"Objective: To explore the treatment effects of the fractional carbon dioxide laser on contracture scars. Methods: A retrospective before-after control study was conducted. From December 2016 to April 2021, 16 patients (7 males and 9 females, aged 3-49 years) with contracture scars causing impaired function of the adjacent joint were admitted to Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. Eighteen joint scars of 16 patients were treated with fractional carbon dioxide laser every 2-3 months until the joint retained its normal range of motion or the effect plateaued. The treatment times of each patient were recorded. Before the first intervention and 6 months after the last treatment, the range of motion of the affected joint were measured in each patient, and the difference was calculated, meanwhile, the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) was used to evaluate the scar of each patient. In the treatment of 1 joint scar in each of 6 patients (totally 6 treatments), the range of motion before the current treatment, immediately after treatment, and at the first follow-up after treatment was noted, and the differences between the range before and immediately after the treatment as well as the range before and at the first follow-up after treatment were calculated. Adverse effects in the treatment area caused by the treatment were noted. At the last follow-up, a self-made questionnaire was used to collect the implementation status of the physical therapy and other scar management modalities during the treatment interval and follow-up period. Data were statistically analyzed with Wilcoxon rank sum test. Results: Eighteen joint scars in 16 patients went through 2 (1, 3) times of treatments by fractional carbon dioxide laser. The range of motion of the affected joint of 16 patients 6 months after the last treatment was 56.5 (39.0, 128.8)°, notably higher than 38.4 (22.9, 116.3)° before the first treatment (Z=-3.724, P<0.01), which was improved by 17.4 (8.0, 24.1)°. The vascular distribution, softness, and thickness scores, and total score in VSS scoring of scars of 16 patients 6 months after the last treatment were significantly lower than those before the first treatment (Z=-2.989, -3.762, -2.814, -3.739, P<0.01), with the most obvious improvement in softness. In 6 treatments, the range of motion immediately after treatment and at the first follow-up of (2.5±0.6) months after treatment were 156.2 (148.0, 164.2)° and 160.2 (156.7, 166.4)°, both notably higher than 151.4 (145.7, 155.3)° before treatment (Z=-2.201, -2.201, P<0.05), which were improved by 9.1 (4.4, 13.0)° and 13.1 (8.0, 15.7)°, respectively. Adverse effects such as blisters, infection, or hypertrophic scar formation was not observed in the treatment area of 16 patients. Most patients adopted physical therapy, compression, silicone gel or sheets, and braces during the treatment interval and follow-up period. Conclusions: The fractional carbon dioxide laser can soften the scar and increase the range of motion of the affected joint, which is suitable for the treatment of mild contracture scars.","Xi, W J; Zhang, Z; Li, J; Su, W J; Li, H; Pu, Z M; Zhang, Y; Feng, S Q; Zhang, Y X",Zhonghua shao shang za zhi = Zhonghua shaoshang zazhi = Chinese journal of burns,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn501120-20210624-00225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34404161/,404

Since that time, the 'suspicious suspects' in the endoscopy unit have grown in number in the eyes of both patients and endoscopists. RECENT FINDINGS This review summarizes the existing guidelines related to infection control in the endoscopy unit and emerging technologies to address gaps, identifies recommendations proposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and reminds the reader that infection prevention has not changed since the emergence of COVID-19, only the importance of infection prevention has increased in visibility. SUMMARY Infection prevention has been and will always be necessary in the gastrointestinal endoscopy unit. Although outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant organisms and infectious diseases like COVID-19 raise the profile of infection control, there have been no major changes to infection control practice recommendations because of the global pandemic. The history of lapses in infection control, persistent contamination of reprocessed endoscopes, and failure of many endoscopy units to identify certain endoscopic procedures as aerosol-generating procedures prior to the pandemic emphasize the need for better knowledge and implementation of infection control practices within endoscopy units.","Hutfless, Susan",Current opinion in gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mog.0000000000000669; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32739987/,404

The Pulvertaft weaves failed at the stabilizing sutures, whereas the loop weaves repairs failed by longitudinal splitting of the motor tendon. The loop weave demonstrated significantly higher mean initial failure and ultimate strengths. Tensile loads required to elongate the loop weave by 4, 6, and 8 mm were significantly higher, while more displacement was associated with the Pulvertaft repair under the application of 50, 75, and 100 N tensile loads.

101421,How telemedicine could benefit perinatal psychiatry.,2021-02-26,"Until recently, the predominant pathology of chronic pelvic pain conditions was thought to reside in the peripheral tissues. However, mounting evidence from neuroimaging studies suggests an important role of the central nervous system in the pathogenesis of these conditions. In the present cross-sectional study, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) of the brain was conducted in female patients with urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS) to determine if they exhibit abnormal concentrations of brain metabolites (e.g. those indicative of heightened excitatory tone) in regions involved in the processing and modulation of pain, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the anterior and posterior insular cortices. Compared to a group of age-matched healthy subjects, there were significantly higher levels of choline (p = 0.006, uncorrected) in the ACC of UCPPS patients. ACC choline levels were therefore compared with the region's resting functional connectivity to the rest of the brain. Higher choline was associated with greater ACC-to-limbic system connectivity in UCPPS patients, contrasted with lower connectivity in controls (i.e. an interaction). In patients, ACC choline levels were also positively correlated with negative mood. ACC γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were lower in UCPPS patients compared with controls (p = 0.02, uncorrected), but this did not meet statistical correction for the 4 separate regional comparisons of metabolites. These results are the first to uncover abnormal GABA and choline levels in the brain of UCPPS patients compared to controls. Low GABA levels have been identified in other pain syndromes and might contribute to CNS hyper-excitability in these conditions. The relationships between increased ACC choline levels, ACC-to-limbic connectivity, and negative mood in UCPPS patients suggest that this metabolite could be related to the affective symptomatology of this syndrome.","Harper, Daniel E; Ichesco, Eric; Schrepf, Andrew; Halvorson, Megan; Puiu, Tudor; Clauw, Daniel J; Harris, Richard E; Harte, Steven E",NeuroImage.

However, an adequate in vitro test system to monitor the barrier function of the alveolar epithelium during inflammation and for assessing anti-inflammatory drugs is urgently needed. Therefore, we treated human Alveolar Epithelial Lentivirus-immortalised cells (hAELVi cells) with the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α (25 ng/ml) and IFN-γ (30 ng/ml), in the presence or absence of hydrocortisone (HC). While TNF-α and IFN-γ are known to reduce epithelial barrier properties, HC could be expected to protect the barrier function and result in an anti-inflammatory effect. We investigated the impact of anti-inflammatory/inflammatory treatment on transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and the apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) of the low permeability marker sodium fluorescein (NaFlu). After incubating hAELVi cells for 48 hours with a combination of TNF-α and IFN-γ, there was a significant decrease in TEER and a significant increase in the Papp. The presence of HC maintained the TEER values and barrier properties, so that no significant Papp change was observed. By using hAELVi cells to study anti-inflammatory drugs in vitro, the need for animal experiments could be reduced and pulmonary drug development accelerated.","Metz, Julia Katharina; Wiegand, Birgit; Schnur, Sabrina; Knoth, Katharina; Schneider-Daum, Nicole; Groß, Henrik; Croston, Glenn; Reinheimer, Torsten Michael; Lehr, Claus-Michael; Hittinger, Marius",Alternatives to laboratory animals : ATLA,https://doi.org/10.1177/0261192920983015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33513307/,404

Several electrocardiographic markers have been used to predict the risk of arrhythmia in patients with COVID-19. We aim to investigate the electrocardiographic (ECG) ventricular repolarization indices in patients with COVID-19. METHODOLOGY We performed a comprehensive systematic literature search from PubMed, EuropePMC, SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Database, and Google Scholar Preprint Servers. The primary endpoints of this search were: Tp-e (T-peak-to-T-end) interval, QTd (QT dispersion), and Tp-e/QTc ratio in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19 from inception up until August 2020. RESULTS There were a total of 241 patients from 2 studies. Meta-analysis showed that Tp-e/QTc ratio was higher in COVID-19 group (mean difference 0.02 [0.01, 0.02], p < 0.001; I2: 18%,).

Their advantage, compared to transanal endoscopic microsurgery, is that they do not require special equipment or training. The aim of this study was to assess our initial experience using the single-site laparoscopic (SSL™) access system (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, OH, USA) for TAMIS. Five patients eligible for local excision of rectal tumors, four males and one female, mean age 58 years (range 50-78), underwent surgery using the SSL™ device. The average distance from anal verge was 4 cm (range 1-6). Four patients had an initial diagnosis of adenoma, and one had a previous endoscopic excision of a T1 adenocarcinoma with positive margins. In one patient, due to the lack of exposure, the procedure was converted to a low anterior resection. In the remaining four patients, average setup time was 7 minutes (range 4-15) and average operative time was 52 minutes (range 38-72). All resection margins were tumor free. There were no postoperative complications. Two of the presumed adenomas were intramucosal adenocarcinomas, while one patient had a T2 tumor and underwent radical surgery. Although at the present time the appropriate use of local excision is still under debate, TAMIS is a technique with great potential. Because of its simplicity and similarity with conventional laparoscopic surgery, it can be learned easily by surgeons not trained in transanal endoscopic microsurgery.","Sevá-Pereira, G; Trombeta, V L; Capochim Romagnolo, L G",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-013-1036-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23740029/,404

Our study brings such a model at atomic resolution in the case of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Presented data resulting from modeling studies are in excellent agreement with experimental findings. A fully atomic three-dimensional (3D) model of squalene epoxidase (EC 1.14.99.7) from S. cerevisiae was built with the help of 3D-Jury approach and further screened based on data known from mutation experiments leading to terbinafine resistance. Docking studies followed by molecular dynamics simulations and quantum interaction energy calculations [MP2/6-31G(d)] resulted in the identification of the terbinafine-squalene epoxidase mode of interaction. In the energetically most likely orientation of terbinafine its interaction energy with the protein is ca. 120 kJ/mol. In the favorable position the terbinafine lipophilic moiety is located vertically inside the squalene epoxidase binding pocket with the tert-butyl group oriented toward its center. Such a position results in the SE conformational changes and prevents the natural substrate from being able to bind to the enzyme's active site. That would explain the noncompetitive manner of SE inhibition. We found that the strongest interaction between terbinafine and SE stems from hydrogen bonding between hydrogen-bond donors, hydroxyl group of Tyr90 and amine nitrogen atom of terbinafine. Moreover, strong attractive interactions were recorded for amino acids whose mutations resulted in terbinafine resistance. Our results, elucidating at a molecular level the mode of terbinafine inhibitory activity, can be utilized in designing more potent or selective antifungal drugs or even medicines lowering cholesterol in humans.","Nowosielski, Marcin; Hoffmann, Marcin; Wyrwicz, Lucjan S; Stepniak, Piotr; Plewczynski, Dariusz M; Lazniewski, Michal; Ginalski, Krzysztof; Rychlewski, Leszek",Journal of chemical information and modeling,https://doi.org/10.1021/ci100403b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21229992/,404

An entertaining online educational method for introducing students to common presentations in neurology.,2020-05-11,"BACKGROUND In laparoscopic incisional hernia repair, direct contact between the prosthesis and the abdominal viscera is inevitable, which may lead to an inflammatory reaction resulting in abdominal adhesion formation. This study compared five different synthetic and biologic meshes in terms of adhesion formation, shrinkage, incorporation, and histologic characteristics after a period of 30 and 90 days. METHODS In 85 rats, a mesh was positioned intraperitoneally in direct contact with the viscera. Five different meshes were implanted: Prolene (polypropylene), Parietex composite (collagen-coated polyester), Strattice (porcine dermis, non-cross-linked), Surgisis (porcine small intestine submucosa, non-cross-linked), and Permacol (porcine dermis, cross-linked). The meshes were tested in terms of adhesion formation, shrinkage, and incorporation after a period of 30 and 90 days. Additionally, collagen formation after 90 days was determined. RESULTS Significantly less adhesion formation was observed with Parietex composite (5 %; interquartile range [IQR], 2-5 %) and Strattice (5 %; IQR, 4-10 %) in the long term. In contrast, organs were attached to Permacol with four of seven meshes (57 %), and adhesion coverage of Surgisis mesh was present in 66 % (IQR, 0-100 %) of the cases. After 90 days, the best incorporation was seen with the Parietex composite mesh (79 %; IQR, 61-83 %). After 90 days, major alterations in adhesion formation were seen compared with 30 days. Histologically, Strattice and Parietex composite showed a new mesothelial layer on the visceral side of the mesh. Microscopic degradation and new collagen formation were seen in the Surgisis group. CONCLUSIONS Parietex composite mesh demonstrated the best long-term results compared with all the other meshes. The biologic non-cross-linked mesh, Strattice, showed little adhesion formation and moderate shrinkage but poor incorporation. Biologic meshes are promising, but varying results require a more detailed investigation and demonstrate that biologic meshes are not necessarily superior to synthetic meshes. The significant changes that take place between 30 and 90 days should lead to careful interpretation of short-term experimental results.","Ditzel, M; Deerenberg, E B; Grotenhuis, N; Harlaar, J J; Monkhorst, K; Bastiaansen-Jenniskens, Y M; Jeekel, J; Lange, J F",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-2939-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23549771/,404
126419,Saving the Babies or the Elderly in a Time of Crisis?,2020-07-01,"PURPOSE Studies of long-term percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) results have been less extensive in children than in adults. The authors sought to evaluate the outcomes of PTA for pediatric renovascular hypertension. MATERIALS AND METHODS The authors retrospectively evaluated 19 hypertensive children (ages 2-18 years) who underwent renal PTA from 1997-2009. Angiograms were reviewed in consensus to characterize lesions. This information was correlated with data from chart review to determine clinical outcomes. RESULTS Seven patients had neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and 12 had fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD); one was lost to follow-up. Technical success was achieved in 29 of 32 lesions (91%). Cure of hypertension was achieved in seven of 18 patients (39%) and improvement in three (17%). There was a failed hypertension response in eight (44%): two with refractory stenosis, four with recurrent stenosis, and two with no response despite technical success. PTA was repeated in five children, all with failed response. Cure or improvement was seen in five of seven patients with NF1 and five of 11 with FMD. Most (nine of ten) patients with cure/improvement had single lesions or discrete lesions ≤ 10 mm. Residual stenosis < 10% was associated with cure/improvement (P = .0395). Three of five with bilateral and two of two with intraparenchymal disease demonstrated failure. The percentage of initial stenosis and presence of ostial lesions, aneurysms, or collaterals were not predictive of clinical response to PTA (P > .05). Cutting balloons were used after failure to efface with conventional balloons in seven patients and was successful in five of seven. CONCLUSIONS Despite a high rate of technical success, PTA provided a clinical benefit in a smaller majority of children. This study characterizes the utility of pediatric renal angioplasty and suggests criteria that may be prognostic of patient response.","Srinivasan, Abhay; Krishnamurthy, Ganesh; Fontalvo-Herazo, Lucia; Nijs, Els; Keller, Marc S; Meyers, Kevin; Kaplan, Bernard; Cahill, Anne-Marie",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2010.07.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20884235/,404

These compounds were synthesized using a Cu(I)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (""click"" reaction) between peptidic azides and dendrimer-derived alkynes and a subsequent metal-free introduction of DOTA via the thio acid/sulfonyl azide amidation (""sulfo-click"" reaction). In a competitive binding assay using rat pancreatic AR42J tumor cells, the monomeric [Tyr(3)]octreotide conjugate displayed the highest binding affinity (IC(50) = 1.32 nM) followed by dimeric [Tyr(3)]octreotide (2.45 nM), [DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotide (2.45 nM), and tetrameric [Tyr(3)]octreotide (14.0 nM). Biodistribution studies with BALB/c nude mice with subcutaneous AR42J tumors showed that the (111)In-labeled monomeric [Tyr(3)]octreotide conjugate had the highest tumor uptake (42.3 +/- 2.8 %ID/g) at 2 h p.i., which was better than [(111)In-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotide (19.5 +/- 4.8 %ID/g). The (111)In-labeled dimeric [Tyr(3)]octreotide conjugate showed a long tumor retention (25.3 +/- 5.9 %ID/g at 2 h p.i. and 12.1 +/- 1.3 %ID/g at 24 h p.i.).

With a view to defining a standardized protocol for GL management, the present retrospective study sought to describe the clinical patterns of post-LSG GL and treatment of the latter in our university medical center. From July 2004 to December 2010, 25 patients were included. GL was described in terms of clinical presentation, time to onset, and location in the staple line. Treatment of GL with pharmacologic, radiologic, endoscopic, and/or surgical procedures was always validated by a multidisciplinary care team. ""Treatment success"" was defined as the absence of contrast agent leakage on CT and endoscopy after removal of covered metallic stent or pigtail drains. Systemic inflammation and peritonitis were the main signs for early-onset GL (56%), whereas pulmonary symptoms and intra-abdominal abscesses revealed delayed-onset GL (44%). Surgery was always performed for early-onset GL. In the total study population, the median number of endoscopic procedures was five (range, 1-11) per patient, of covered SEMS was three (range, 1-8), and of pigtail drains was three (range, 1-4). Nine (36%) patients presented endoscopic-related complications. Four (16%) patients with treatment failure underwent radical surgery. The mortality rate was 4% (n = 1). The management of post-LSG GL is challenging. Surgery was always performed for early-onset GL, whereas treatment of delayed-onset GL was based on endoscopy. Pigtail drains required fewer procedures per patient, were better tolerated, and had lower morbidity-mortality than covered SEMS.","Pequignot, A; Fuks, D; Verhaeghe, P; Dhahri, A; Brehant, O; Bartoli, E; Delcenserie, R; Yzet, T; Regimbeau, J-M",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-012-0597-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22328096/,404
136755,"[In the United Kingdom, volunteer caregivers to reinforce COVID vaccination teams].",2021-04-01,"Sarcoma treatment during the covid-19 pandemic is a new challenge. This patient population is often immunocompromised and potentially more susceptible to viral complications. Government guidelines highlight the need to minimize patient exposure to unnecessary hospital visits. However, those guidelines lack practical recommendations on ways to manage triage and diagnosis expressly for new cancer patients. Furthermore, there are no reports on the efficiency of the guidelines. One of the main issues in treating musculoskeletal tumours is the complexity and variability of presentation. We offer a triage model, used in a quaternary-referral musculoskeletal oncology centre, that allows us to maintain an open pathway for referral of new patients while minimizing exposure risks. A multidisciplinary approach and analysis of existing investigations allow for a pre-clinic evaluation. The model identifies 3 groups of patients: ■ Patients with suspected high-grade malignancy, or benign cases with aggressive features, both in need of further evaluation in the clinic and prompt treatment■ Patients with low-grade malignancy, and benign cases whose treatment is not urgent, that are managed during the pandemic by telemedicine, with reassurance and information about their illness■ Patients who can be managed by their local medical professionals In comparison to a pre-pandemic period, that approach resulted in a higher ratio of malignant-to-benign conditions for new patients seen in the clinic (3:4 vs. 1:3 respectively), thus using available resources more efficiently and prioritizing patients with suspected high-grade malignancy. We believe that this triage system could be applied in other surgical oncology fields during a pandemic.","Olshinka, N; Mottard, S",Current oncology,https://doi.org/10.3747/co.27.6907; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33173391/,404

Also, vitamin D deficiency attenuate the immune system and predispose a person more susceptible to infection. In this context, we aimed to evaluate vitamin D, Electrolytes, Complete blood count, Liver enzymes, Urea, Creatinine, Albumin, CRP and ESR levels in patients with Covid-19. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study on 118 patients with Covid-19 who were hospitalized from 2020/2/19 to 2020/4/3 in ICU. Serum levels of electrolytes, liver enzymes, blood factors, urea, creatinine, CRP and ESR as well as anthropometric parameters and serum vitamin D concentration were measured. RESULTS A total of 118 patients (80 male and 38 female) was enrolled in the study (65.05±15.75 years). Only 5.08% of patients had no risk factors and 55.9% had ≥ 2 risk factors. Diabetes (44.1%) and obesity (23.7%) were more common among patients. Laboratory finding showed that 80.50% of patients had hyponatremia, but other electrolytes included K, Mg, Ca and P were normal in majority of participants as well as CBC, Cr, Urea, Alb, ALT and ALKP. The AST concentration increased in most patients (66.94%). All patients had high levels of inflammatory factors such as CRP and ESR. The mean of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels in participants (25.95 ± 14.56 ng/mL) was lower than its levels in general papulation. However, it was not statistically significant (P= 0.88). A significant negative correlation found between vitamin D and ALT (P= 0.02, -0.21) as well as vitamin D and CRP (P= 0.05, -0.17). CONCLUSION Regarding to the regulatory role of vitamin D in immune system and low levels of vitamin D in Covid-19 infected patients, the evaluation of vitamin D levels and prescribe supplements if necessary is suggested.","Abdollahi, Hamed; Salehinia, Farahnaz; Badeli, Mostafa; Karimi, Elmira; Gandomkar, Hossein; Asadollahi, Amin; Sedighiyan, Mohsen; Abdolahi, Mina","Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",https://doi.org/10.2174/1871530321666210316103403; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33726658/,404

Seventy horses were included in the study; the Western Riding horse breeds were the most affected (Quarter Horse 34/70, 48.5%; Appaloosa 9/70, 12.8%). In unilateral cryptorchids (65/70, 92.8%) the most common location for a retained testis was the left abdomen (28/65, 43%), while in bilateral cryptorchids (5/70, 7.1%), bilateral abdominal retention was the most frequent (3/5, 6%). Information about testis localization was achieved through transabdominal ultrasound (30/49 cases, 61.2%), through per rectum palpation (21/49 cases, 42.9%) and through inguinal palpation (14/49 cases, 28.9%). Cryptorchidectomy was achieved with standing laparoscopy (44/70 cases, 62.8%), or with open inguinal orchiectomy in general anesthesia (26/70 cases, 37.2%). Complications during laparoscopy were spleen puncture (1/44, 2.2%), a self-limiting bleeding from the spermatic cord (10/44 cases, 22.7%), hyperthermia (3/44 cases, 6.8%), and emphysema (15/44, 34%). During inguinal open cryptorchidectomy difficulties with identifying the inguinal testis during surgery (8/26 cases, 30.8%) and a moderate and self-limiting swelling of the inguinal region after surgery (17/26, 65.4%) were observed.

Our aim was to determine the diagnostic value of the negative susceptibility vessel sign on T2*-weighted gradient-echo MR imaging for predicting underlying intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis in patients with acute MCA occlusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ninety-one consecutive patients with acute stroke because of MCA occlusion underwent gradient-echo MR imaging and MRA before endovascular therapy. The negative susceptibility vessel sign was defined as an absence of a hypointense signal change within the occluded MCA on gradient-echo imaging. Underlying intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis was determined by conventional angiography. The sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and accuracy of the negative susceptibility vessel sign for predicting the presence of underlying intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis were assessed. RESULTS The negative susceptibility vessel sign was identified in 42 (46.1%) of 91 patients, and 18 (19.8%) patients had an underlying intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis responsible for acute ischemic symptoms. The negative susceptibility vessel sign was more frequently observed in patients with intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis than in those without it (100% versus 32.9%, P < .001). In the prediction of an underlying intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis, the negative susceptibility vessel sign had 100% sensitivity, 67.1% specificity, 42.9% positive predictive value, 100% negative predictive value, and an accuracy of 73.6%. CONCLUSIONS The negative susceptibility vessel sign on gradient-echo MR imaging is a sensitive marker with a high negative predictive value for the presence of an underlying intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis in patients with acute ischemic stroke because of MCA occlusions. The susceptibility vessel sign can be used in decision-making when performing subsequent endovascular revascularization therapy in patients with acute MCA occlusions.","Kim, S K; Yoon, W; Heo, T W; Park, M S; Kang, H K",AJNR.

Bowel obstruction eventually results and has a profound effect on quality of life eventually leading to the demise of these patients. METHODS In order to improve the quality of life and combat the requirement for a nasogastric tube, a combination of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) to allow adequate caloric intake plus cervical esophagostomy to drain intestinal secretions was utilized as a palliative treatment long-term for patients with malignancy-associated bowel obstruction. RESULTS In 2 patients with appendiceal malignancy no cancer spread outside of the peritoneal space occurred. Unfortunately, total obstruction of the bowel caused unremitting nausea, vomiting, and pain accompanied by an inability to take adequate nutrition by mouth. In these 2 patients TPN long-term was initiated and a cervical esophagostomy tube placed percutaneously. Relief of malnutrition and the symptoms of nausea and vomiting were well treated using this combined approach. Pain management continued as an ongoing problem. CONCLUSIONS Long-term management of malignancy-associated bowel obstruction is possible with improvement in quality of life using a combination of TPN and a cervical esophagostomy tube. In these two cases the cervical esophagostomy tube was placed with limited adverse events, and adequate drainage of intestinal secretions long-term.","Sugarbaker, Paul H; Khaitan, Puja G; Ihemelandu, Chukwuemeka",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2018.11.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30481740/,404

DESIGN Closed- and open-ended online survey questions were collected from adult cancer survivors (N = 972). METHODS Logistic regression identified factors associated with treatment, infection, and financial worry. Thematic qualitative analysis generated information around participants' experiences and worries related to COVID-19 and healthcare. FINDINGS Characteristics including marital status, race/ethnicity, cancer type, time since last treatment, education, and age were associated with health and healthcare worry outcomes.

162587,Assessing a Trauma-Informed Approach to the COVID-19 Pandemic in Higher Education: A Mixed Methods Study,2021,"BACKGROUND Nature play is growing in popularity as children's play spaces are transforming from traditional playgrounds into more nature-based play spaces with considerable financial and resource investment from government bodies. This has resulted in the re-development of children's play spaces to incorporate more natural elements such as trees, plants and rocks. Despite this, it is unclear whether there is empirical evidence to support claims that play in nature is beneficial for child health and development. AIM To conduct a systematic review examining the impacts of nature play on the health and developmental outcomes of children aged 2-12 years. METHODS Seven electronic databases were searched (MEDLINE, ERIC, Embase, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library, The Joanna Briggs Institute and Emcare) from inception to July/August 2018 (search updated July/August 2019). The Inclusion criteria were children aged 2-12 years with no health/developmental conditions. The exposure/intervention of interest was unstructured, free play in nature. Critical appraisal of included studies was conducted using the McMaster Critical Appraisal Tool. Descriptive synthesis was then undertaken using the NHMRC FORM Framework. RESULTS Out of 2927 articles identified, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria. The nature play exposure/intervention was heterogeneously described, and a plethora of outcome measures were used. Nature play had consistent positive impacts on physical activity outcomes and cognitive play behaviours (imaginative and dramatic play). However, there remain some concerns regarding the quality of the evidence base, heterogeneity in intervention description and parameters in the outcome measures used. CONCLUSIONS While the positive impacts of nature play were encouraging in terms of physical activity and cognitive development, nature play stakeholders should focus on producing a universal definition for nature play, the development of standardised outcome measures and the conduct of robust research designs. Implications of these findings suggest the need for the development of standardised guidelines to inform practice and policy in the design of children's play spaces in different contexts.","Dankiw, Kylie A; Tsiros, Margarita D; Baldock, Katherine L; Kumar, Saravana",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32053683/,404
163027,Roles of social media and counselling support in reducing anxiety among Malaysian during Covid-19 pandemic,2021,"We provide evidence of delayed attention and inaction in response to COVID-19 in countries that did not experience SARS in 2003. Using cross-country data, we find that individuals in countries that had SARS infections in 2003 searched more intensively for COVID-19-related information on Google in late January 2020, the time of the first known outbreak in Wuhan, China. Early attention to the novel virus, as measured by Google searches, is associated with deeper stock market drops in countries with SARS experience. In contrast, people in countries without SARS experience started to pay more attention much later, in March. Moreover, governments in these countries responded significantly more slowly in implementing social distancing policies to combat domestic COVID-19 outbreaks than governments in countries with SARS experience. Moreover, such early responses of individuals and governments in countries with SARS experience are prevalent within continent, even in non-Asian countries. Furthermore, people in countries with SARS experience are more compliant with social distancing rules. These timely attention and proactive responses of individuals and governments are more pronounced in countries that reported deaths caused by SARS, which left deeper imprints. Our findings suggest that the imprint of similar viruses' experience is a fundamental mechanism underlying timely responses to COVID-19.","Ru, Hong Yang Endong Zou Kunru",Management Science,https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.4015,404
163255,'Out of the Frying Pan into the Fire': Mauritian Social Workers' Perspectives on Disaster Governance in Mauritius,2021,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework on how to deal with stressors emerging from the COVID-19 outbreak. The theoretical framework aims to explain pandemic-related stressors and potential ways to prevent them, considering a wide range of interacting factors at individual, team and organizational levels to ensure their employees' health. Design/methodology/approach The authors drew on an integrative literature review to identify pandemic-related stressors influenceable by the organization and gathered solution approaches to counteract them. Popular psychological stress theories served as a theoretical base for the framework. Findings The authors based the framework on an integration of the transactional stress theory (Lazarus and Folkman, 1984) and the job demands resources model (Schaufeli and Bakker, 2004), focusing on their respective theoretical strengths. The final framework offers a solid orientation for scholars regarding the introduction of holistic and strategic measures in coping with pandemic-related stressors. A section describing possibilities for practitioners' use of the framework has been integrated. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to offer a framework on how to handle COVID-19-related stressors in the workplace by implementing teamwide and companywide measures.","Gauer, S.; Germann, B.",Journal of Corporate Real Estate,https://doi.org/10.1108/jcre-10-2020-0045,404

We employ aggregate data at industry level and use a methodology based on mean difference tests and two-samples Kolmogorov-Smirnoff tests. We find a varied panorama of industry recovery in EU after the 2007-2009 crisis, albeit with different paces depending on size, ownership, and level of technological intensity. There is evidence of a higher flexibility of smaller companies, reflected mostly in productivity gains, and a focus of larger businesses on profitability, supported by their size. Moreover, better personnel cost management has led to a drop in the importance of personnel costs in turnover. Our results are valuable for businesses that needed to survive during the pandemics, as they show that higher business flexibility might support a quicker recovery.","Popescu, C.

In March 2019, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) designated remdesivir for compassionate use to treat COVID-19. Thus, the development of novel antiviral agents, antibodies, and vaccines against COVID-19 is an urgent research subject. Many laboratories and research organizations are actively investing in the development of new compounds for COVID-19. Through in silico high-throughput virtual screening, we have recently identified compounds from the compound library of Natural Products Research Laboratories (NPRL) that can bind to COVID-19 3Lpro polyprotein and block COVID-19 3Lpro activity through in silico high-throughput virtual screening. Curcuminoid derivatives (including NPRL334, NPRL339, NPRL342, NPRL346, NPRL407, NPRL415, NPRL420, NPRL472, and NPRL473) display strong binding affinity to COVID-19 3Lpro polyprotein. The binding site of curcuminoid derivatives to COVID-19 3Lpro polyprotein is the same as that of the FDA-approved human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitor (lopinavir) to COVID-19 3Lpro polyprotein. The binding affinity of curcuminoid derivatives to COVID-19 3Lpro is stronger than that of lopinavir and curcumin. Among curcuminoid derivatives, NPRL-334 revealed the strongest binding affinity to COVID-19 3Lpro polyprotein and is speculated to have an anti-COVID-19 effect. In vitro and in vivo ongoing experiments are currently underway to confirm the present findings. This study sheds light on the drug design for COVID-19 3Lpro polyprotein. Basing on lead compound development, we provide new insights on inhibiting COVID-19 attachment to cells, reducing COVID-19 infection rate and drug side effects, and increasing therapeutic success rate.","Yang, JaiSing Chiang JoHua Tsai ShihChang Hsu YuanMan Bau DaTian Lee KuoHsiung Tsai FuuJen",Natural Product Communications,https://doi.org/10.1177/1934578x20953262,404

Material and Methods: This study was designed as a single-center, retrospective, and observational study. The patients were divided into three groups relative to the date of the first COVID-19 case in Turkey, which was March 10, 2020 (Group A: before the pandemic;Group B: pandemic period;Group C: the same period one year before the pandemic). A total of 413 patients were included in the study. Results: In terms of treatment modality, the rate of open appendectomy was significantly higher in Group B (p&lt;0.001). Rates of conversion to open surgery, as well as rates of complicated appendicitis were also significantly higher in Group B (p=0.027, p=0.024, respectively). While there was no difference between the groups in terms of preoperative hospitalization duration (p=0.102), it was found that the duration of symptoms, operation time, and postoperative length of hospital stay were significantly higher in Group B (p&lt;0.001, p=0.011, p=0.001, respectively). In addition, the complication rate in group B (8.9%) was also significantly higher than in the other two groups (p=0.023). Discussion: We found that the rate of open surgery, the rate of conversion of laparoscopic surgery to open surgery, complication rates, mean operation time, and postoperative hospital stay were significantly higher in AA patients that underwent surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic period. We believe that the main reason for this negative outcome is the late admission of the patients to the hospital.","Başer, M.; Katar, M.

The accuracy of a diagnosis is determined by the imaging modality used and the images' consistency. This paper describes a gradient-based enhancement algorithm (GCE) for CT images that can increase the visibility of the infected region. Using a multi-scale dependent dark pass filter aims to increase contrast while preserving information and edge details of the infected area. Joint occurrence between the edge details and pixel intensities of the input image is calculated to construct a cumulative distribution function (CDF). To obtain the contrast improved image, the CDF is mapped to the uniform distribution. The GCE approach is tested on the CT Covid database, and performance metrics like the contrast improvement index (CII), discrete entropy (DE), and Kullback-Leibler distance (KL-Distance) are used to evaluate the results. Compared to other techniques available in the literature, the GCE approach produces the highest CII and DE values and has more uniformity. To check the suitability of the enhancement algorithm in terms of pre-processing, a pre-trained AlexNet is employed for the classification of Covid-19 images. The finding shows an improvement of 7% in classification accuracy after enhancing the Covid-19 images using the GCE technique.

It documents, more specifically, how shops tried to maintain, re-establish, or even re-invent communication with their customers during this two-month period. Based on pictures of shop windows in a Flemish city, we analyze the (semi-)commercial messages that appeared in this setting during this period. This analysis adopts an interdisciplinary perspective, in which a cognitive linguistic approach is integrated with analyses and practical advices by marketing agencies. Despite their orientation towards distinct, theoretical and practical goals, both approaches share an analytical interest in mapping participants and their mutual relationship as part of a communicative interaction. In the period of economic lockdown, marketers urged shop owners to ‘humanize’ their business strategy by downplaying content-related issues in favor of maximal social outreach towards customers. Con-sidering this advice, it was hypothesized that under these circumstances participants in commercial transactions would be construed much more prominently, presenting themselves and each other as unprecedented empathetic business personas. Much of our data comply with this expectation, thus providing empirical evidence of a subjectified communicative ground, in which both buyer and seller personas figure with augmented prominence as parts of the object of conceptualization.

173562,A Call for Person-Centered and City-Centered Student Supports,2021,"Modern cancer research, and the wealth of data across multiple spatial and temporal scales, has created the need for researchers that are well-versed in the life sciences (cancer biology, developmental biology, immunology), medical sciences (oncology) and natural sciences (mathematics, physics, engineering, computer sciences). College undergraduate education is traditionally provided in disciplinary silos, which creates a steep learning curve at the graduate and postdoctoral levels that increasingly bridge multiple disciplines. Numerous colleges have begun to embrace interdisciplinary curricula, but students who double-major in mathematics (or other quantitative sciences) and biology (or medicine) remain scarce. We identified the need to educate junior and senior high school students about integrating mathematical and biological skills, through the lens of mathematical oncology, to better prepare students for future careers at the interdisciplinary interface. The High school Internship Program in Integrated Mathematical Oncology (HIP IMO) at Moffitt Cancer Center has so far trained 59 students between 2015 and 2019. We report here on the program structure, training deliverables, curriculum, and outcomes. We hope to promote such interdisciplinary educational activities early in a student’s career.","Enderling, Heiko; Altrock, Philipp M.; Andor, Noemi; Basanta, David; Brown, Joel S.; Gatenby, Robert A.; Marusyk, Andriy; Rejniak, Katarzyna A.; Silva, Ariosto; Anderson, Alexander R.A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.967950,404

Its focus is on women's labor in the aftermath of the previous global recession, launched by the 2007–8 financial crisis. As the degree of countries’ integration into the global financial market differed, this recession unfolded differently, hitting stronger economies that were more dependent on the global market. Comprising work from twenty-six researchers, Global Women's Work offers much more than an analysis of short-term consequences of recession on women's work and employment: many contributions discuss longer-term trends in policy and activism as well.

173970,"Empreendedorismo e coronavírus: impactos, estratégias e oportunidades frente à crise global",2021,"Crowdsourcing markets provide workers with a centralized place to find paid work. What may not be obvious at first glance is that, in addition to the work they do for pay, crowd workers also have to shoulder a variety of unpaid invisible labor in these markets, which ultimately reduces workers' hourly wages. Invisible labor includes finding good tasks, messaging requesters, or managing payments. However, we currently know little about how much time crowd workers actually spend on invisible labor or how much it costs them economically. To ensure a fair and equitable future for crowd work, we need to be certain that workers are being paid fairly for all of the work they do. In this paper, we conduct a field study to quantify the invisible labor in crowd work. We build a plugin to record the amount of time that 100 workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk dedicate to invisible labor while completing 40,903 tasks. If we ignore the time workers spent on invisible labor, workers' median hourly wage was $3.76. But, we estimated that crowd workers in our study spent 33% of their time daily on invisible labor, dropping their median hourly wage to $2.83. We found that the invisible labor differentially impacts workers depending on their skill level and workers' demographics. The invisible labor category that took the most time and that was also the most common revolved around workers having to manage their payments. The second most time-consuming invisible labor category involved hyper-vigilance, where workers vigilantly watched over requesters' profiles for newly posted work or vigilantly searched for labor. We hope that through our paper, the invisible labor in crowdsourcing becomes more visible, and our results help to reveal the larger implications of the continuing invisibility of labor in crowdsourcing.","Toxtli, Carlos; Suri, Siddharth; Savage, Saiph",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00169v1.pdf,404

For that, we utilize an algorithmic auditing methodology that uses virtual agents to conduct large-scale analysis of algorithmic information curation in a controlled environment. Specifically, we look at the text search results for""us elections"",""donald trump"",""joe biden""and""bernie sanders""queries on Google, Baidu, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, and Yandex, during the 2020 primaries. Our findings indicate substantial differences in the search results between search engines and multiple discrepancies within the results generated for different agents using the same search engine. It highlights that whether users see certain information is decided by chance due to the inherent randomization of search results. We also find that some search engines prioritize different categories of information sources with respect to specific candidates. These observations demonstrate that algorithmic curation of political information can create information inequalities between the search engine users even under nonpersonalized conditions. Such inequalities are particularly troubling considering that search results are highly trusted by the public and can shift the opinions of undecided voters as demonstrated by previous research.","Urman, Aleksandra; Makhortykh, Mykola; Ulloa, Roberto",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00756v1.pdf,404
175220,O32 Leveraging Every Door Direct Mail for Remote Recruitment of a Rural Study Sample: Response Rate and Representativeness,2021,"Background The highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets and aerosols. Consequently, people are required to wear masks and maintain a social distance to avoid spreading of the virus. Despite the success of the commercially available vaccines, the virus is still uncontained globally. Given the tropism of SARS-CoV-2, a mucosal immune reaction would help to reduce viral shedding and transmission locally. Only seven out of hundreds of ongoing clinical trials are testing the intranasal delivery of COVID-19 vaccines. Methods In the current study, we tested in murine model the immunogenicity of a conventional vaccine platform based on virus-like particles (VLPs) displaying RBD of SARS-CoV-2 for intranasal vaccination. The candidate vaccine, CuMVTT-RBD, has been immunologically optimized to incorporate tetanus-toxin and is self-adjuvanted with TLR7/8 ligands. Results CuMVTT-RBD elicited strong RBD- and spike- specific systemic IgG and IgA antibody responses of high avidity. Local immune responses were assessed and results demonstrate strong mucosal antibody and plasma cell production in lung tissue. The induced systemic antibodies could efficiently recognize and neutralize different Variants of Concerns of mutated SARS-CoV-2 RBDs. Conclusion In summary, intranasal vaccination with CuMVTT-RBD shows high immunogenicity and induces protective systemic and local specific antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.

Their thoughtful engagement with the changes they faced?changes in behavior, in social life, in nature?is reflected in their many paintings at the Syracuse University Art Museum, which I organized into an online exhibit, ?Mithila Art in the Time of Covid-19.? Several painters focused on the All-India Lockdown imposed by Prime Minister Modi on March 24, 2020. With millions of laborers stranded in India?s cities, lacking work, housing, or food, a massive human movement home began. Here I engage with four paintings of the Lockdown and journeys home, two by a Dalit male artist, himself at times a migrant day-laborer, and the other two by a middle-class/upper caste educated female artist. Representing social positions at the two ends of the social structure of the Mithila region, they present contrasting views of what the Lockdown meant. Both also focus on what they see as the failure of the Indian government in this time of crisis.","Wadley, Susan Snow",Anthropology and Humanism,https://doi.org/10.1111/anhu.12349,404

In this paper, we provide ways of developing a holistic research strategy using bibliometric-data driven approaches that integrate network analysis and information management, without the need of full paper access. This protocol is a comprehensive multi-modular pathway for analysis of metadata obtained from major scientific publishing houses by use of a Decision Support System (DSS). A simple case study on the invasive species Lantana camara has been presented as a proof-of-concept to show how one can implement this DSS based protocol. Some perspectives are also provided on how the outcomes can be used directly or scaled up for long term research interventions.

177460,Everyday gendered performances at home: Masculine domesticity?,2021-12-31,"Like other European countries, Germany has experienced the 2nd wave of the COVID-19 amid obligations of social distancing and wearing of face masks in public spaces. Although Germany successfully contained the virus during the 1st wave, it has faced difficulties in controlling the COVID-19 during the 2nd wave. This study develops a computer model representing the COVID-19 flow in Germany by comparing the effects of the measures taken during the 1st and the 2nd waves. The computer model is based on the SEIR concept and the system dynamics (SD) approach in which some unknown parameters are estimated through the calibration process. Moreover, the SEIR computer model is developed by considering different cases in older and young people and the SEIR model successfully reproduces similar patterns of infected, recovered, and death cases in the 1st and the 2nd waves in Germany. The SEIR model also shows that the measures taken in the 1st wave have different efficacies than those in the 2nd wave, leading to higher infected cases during the 2nd wave. Since the SEIR model can successfully reproduce similar patterns, the SEIR model can be a basis for further studies in estimating other resource needs such as health workers, and bed capacities.

177973,"Urban Immunity Against the Pandemic within the Framework of Public Administration, City and Citizens1",2021,"Introduction. In an age where social media is prevalent and long hours are spent browsing through the internet, it is crucial to understand audience engagement. Two of the most common platforms used worldwide are Twitter and Facebook. Both have provided a unique opportunity for the science world;it broadened the horizons for spreading information on current endeavors in the research world. Clinical Neurophysiology and Clinical Neurophysiology Practice, the Official Journals of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology, opened the Twitter and Facebook pages on April 1, 2020. We determined what factors would alter users' engagement. Methods. We employed a multivariate regression analysis. The tested predictor variables included 'days elapsed since the opening (range: 1–100)', 'posting during weekend', 'introduction of a 2020 article', 'author interview', 'inclusion of guidelines or review article', 'COVID19-related information', 'number of hashtags', 'number of attachments', 'presence of colored attachment', and 'attachment of movie'. The dependent variable was the proportion of engaged users, defined as the number of link clicks divided by users who saw the post. Results. Posts including author interviews (p < 0.001) and those introducing guidelines/review articles (p = 0.005) independently increased the proportion of engaged Facebook users. Conversely, posts including a larger number of colored attachments (p < 0.001) and those introducing COVID19-related articles (p = 0.007) independently increased the proportion of engaged Twitter users. Conclusion. Different types of posts attracted Facebook and Twitter users. Facebook users were specifically engaged with interview-based posts. Facebook users might be willing to read through lengthy posts to understand the authors' stories behind the study. In contrast, Twitter users might want to absorb essential information with a glance.

Whenbroadly accessible, it can enable socioeconomic mobility, improve health outcomes, advance socialcohesion, and support a highly skilled workforce. It yields public benefits not only in improvedwell-being and economic prosperity, but also in reduced costs in health care and social services. Canada also relies heavily on the PSE sector for research. During the COVID-19 pandemic, PSE hassupported research related to the pandemic response and other critical areas, including providingexpert advice to support public health and government decision-making, while maintaining educationalprograms and continuing to contribute to local and regional economies. But the pandemiceffort has stretched already strained PSE resources and people even further: for decades, decliningpublic investment has driven increases in tuition and decreases in faculty complement, underminingCanadas research capacity and increasing student debt as well as destabilizing the sector through agrowing reliance on volatile international education markets. Given the challenges before us, including climate change, reconciliation, and the pandemic, it is imperative that we better draw onthe full range of experience, knowledge, and creativity in Canada and beyond through an inclusive, stable, and globally engaged PSE. Supporting PSEs recovery will be key to Canadas ongoingpandemic response and recovery.

This paper aims to understand the pandemic's impact on the market supply of vegetables (agrifood) in Ethiopia and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa and to implement scientifically based recommendations that can improve the challenges caused by the pandemic and improve the livelihoods of vegetable producers. Design/methodology/approach This study assessed the major incidents that follow the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia with the factors that significantly influence onion market supply in the Mecha district of Northwestern Ethiopia using linear multiple regression. Findings The study revealed that producers, processors, local collectors, cooperatives, wholesalers, retailers and consumers are the main actors. The most important difference that happened on the onion market channel after the outbreak of coronavirus was brokers were removed from the market channel after the pandemic and this saved the cost producers pay as a commission. The pandemic disrupted input distribution, extension and cooperative services and created labor scarcity. Access to market, postharvest value addition, price and marketing contract were significant factors that influence the market supply of onion. The study identified the need for policy interventions by the government to overcome the postpandemic challenges and ensure the sustainable development of onion production and marketing in the Mecha district. Research limitations/implications The limitations of the study are primarily related to the methodology as data are collected at a single moment in time. However, the study observes that those changes after the pandemic are better understood if we collect data at different time. Therefore, the future study needs to provide longitudinal data to examine stability of response and to observe performance of the market that occur over time. Originality/value This original research is the first to study the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in Northwestern Ethiopia. The data used in the analysis are primary.","Worku, A.; Ulku, M.

182037,Transmediatisation of the Covid-19 crisis in Brazil: The emergence of (bio-/geo-)political repertoires of (re-)interpretation,2021,"In the past five years, anthropologists from the global South have come to consider public cash transfer programs as an alternative to both work-centered policies and national development projects. These studies suggest that grants today go beyond the domain of traditional social policies and government bureaucracy and point to a new future in view of the scarcity of work. This future has become even closer with the pandemic of COVID-19, and with governments, non-governmental entities and the political left reaffirming the importance of a basic universal income. Considering these discussions, my article focuses on an income transfer program in South Africa after the Apartheid period, placing an ethnographic account in relation to the design of a ‘progressive’ policy of social grants. I present a longer history of salaried work in relation to rural African households and show how the emancipatory promises of cash transfer projects were read as a risk to local traditions and morals. In addition to this reduction in political hopes invested in transfers, I examine the temporal aspect of cash transfers, as well as the possible futures they evoke. By considering the futures that grants enable, I conclude by suggesting that it is premature to affirm that they have overcome wage work and its attendant sociality. © 2021, UNIV SAOPAULO.

182985,Canadian Conference on Medical Education,2020-04-18,"In the early months of 2020, the regional propagation of COVID-19, a novel coronavirus, has evolved into a global public health emergency. Governments have not yet decided on an optimal plan to defend from COVID-19 due to lack of previous experience with such large-scale pandemics. Neither have researchers published a holistic approach of anticontagion policy analysis. In order to explore the middle ground of minimized negative effects on health and economy, this paper evaluated 1, 637 non-pharmaceutical anti-contagion policies from sub-regions in China, France, Italy, and South Korea. Inspired by previous research [1] [2], we utilized reduced-form approach and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model in the field of macroeconomics to calculate the effect of each individual policy on infection and GDP growth rates. These methods are based on filtered financial accounts (i.e. social accounting matrices) obtained from Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) database along with a published G-Cubed (G20) model, as well as the epidemiological data concerning the national conditions of each aforementioned country. We complete more than 1, 000 random samplings and iterations to average the policy coefficients of infection and GDP growth rates and minimize their standard errors. The major observation on the results is that an early implementation of travel ban for 2 weeks will effectively undermine the spread of COVID-19 at a low economic price. In addition, some policies (e.g. social distancing) require adjustment in their duration or range to improve their price-performance ratio (here, economic-health ratio). This form of hybrid policy analysis not only prevents further infectivity, but also ensures the stability of the global economy. © 2021 IEEE.","Shao, Z.; Sun, J.","2nd International Conference on Computing and Data Science, CDS 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/cds52072.2021.00093,404

196687,The role of biochemical markers as early indicators of cardiac damage and prognostic parameters of perinatal asphyxia.,2014,"AIM A standardized postoperative score, the DULK (Dutch leakage) score, has been demonstrated to be a useful clinical tool in the diagnosis of anastomotic leakage. It is complicated, however, and a simplification (the modified DULK score) based on fewer parameters derived from multiple logistic regression analyses has been developed. These include clinical condition, abdominal pain not localized at the wound, C-reactive protein level and respiratory rate. The accuracy of each was compared. METHOD Data of all patients from five Dutch centres operated on between 16 October 2007 and 1 November 2009 with an anastomosis in the colon or rectum were entered into a prospectively maintained database. RESULTS In total, 782 patients were included of whom 81 (10.4%) had a clinically relevant anastomotic leakage. The DULK score gave an overall sensitivity of 97% for anastomotic leakage, overall specificity of 53%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 16% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99%. The modified DULK score used clinical condition, abdominal pain not localized at the wound, C-reactive protein level and respiratory rate. With at least one parameter present, overall sensitivity was 97%, overall specificity 57%, PPV 17% and NPV 99.5%. With at least two points PPV was 41% and with three points 57%. CONCLUSION Both the original and modified DULK scores are useful for the early diagnosis of clinically relevant anastomotic leakage. The modified DULK score offers the benefit of fewer parameters and so can easily be used in a clinical environment to estimate the likelihood of anastomotic leakage. However, the early diagnosis of anastomotic leakage remains difficult.","den Dulk, M; Witvliet, M J; Kortram, K; Neijenhuis, P A; de Hingh, I H; Engel, A F; van de Velde, C J H; de Brauw, L M; Putter, H; Brouwers, M A M; Steup, W-H",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24199233/,404

Treatment of the membrane fraction prepared from cells expressing the 16-kDa protein with Triton X-100, a high pH, and a high concentration of salts showed that the protein may be tightly associated with intracellular membranes. Dual-labeling experiments demonstrated that the 16-kDa protein colocalized with the 5'-bromouridine 5'-triphosphate-labeled viral RNA, suggesting that it may be associated with the viral replication machinery. Sequence comparison of the 16-kDa protein with the equivalent products of other coronaviruses showed multiple conserved cysteine residues, and site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that these conserved residues may contribute to dimerization of the 16-kDa protein. Furthermore, increased accumulation of the 16-kDa protein upon stimulation with epidermal growth factor was observed, providing preliminary evidence that the protein might be involved in the growth factor signaling pathway.","Ng, Lisa F P; Liu, D X",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12021359/,404

Amidst the rising number of cases and deaths, it is imperative to not forget Tuberculosis (TB) which is another pandemic existing since centuries. There could be dire consequences for tuberculosis patients globally especially in low and middle income countries with a high burden of disease and overwhelmed health care systems. Tuberculosis is still the leading infectious killer worldwide, and therefore, it is crucial to reflect on the interaction between the two diseases. Evidence suggests that both COVID-19 and tuberculosis have a synergistic relationship, boosting detrimental effect of each other, disrupting existing health care models, and also worsening the clinical outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality. This review aims to draw attention towards this pertinent clinical issue, and tries to unravel the intricate relationship between COVID-19 and tuberculosis, as also the role of BCG vaccination to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gupta, Udita; Prakash, Anupam; Sachdeva, Sonali; Pangtey, Ghan Shyam; Khosla, Akshita; Aggarwal, Ramesh; Sud, Ritika; Margekar, Shubha Laxmi",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33247647/,404
199921,Connecting nature and the people: Environmental social work,2021,"Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common cause of hospital admission. Our objective is to determine variables that correlate with failure of the laparoscopic approach for SBO. Twenty-three consecutive patients underwent diagnostic laparoscopy with curative intent for treatment of SBO by a single surgeon over a 3-year period. The laparoscopic approach was successful in 18 patients (78%); there were five (22%) conversions to laparotomy. The causes of obstruction included adhesive band in 16 patients; and small bowel lymphoma, metastatic esophageal cancer, small bowel gangrene, Meckel diverticulum, gallstones ileus, and incarcerated incisional hernia in two. Using the Fisher two-sided test, no significant predictor for conversion was identified using gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, previous bowel obstruction, history of adhesiolysis, abdominal distention, pelvic surgeries, chemotherapy, radiation, malignancy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, coronary artery disease, hypertension, or hypercholesterolenemia. The Wilcoxon two-sided test did not show significance for age, weight, number of previous abdominal surgeries, or small bowel diameter. The postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter in the laparoscopic group compared with those who needed conversion (3 vs. 9 days) with P = 0.0019. No mortality was noted in any patients. The laparoscopic is safe and feasible for the management of SBO. We believe that the laparoscopic approach should be offered to all patients with SBO unless there is an absolute contraindication to laparoscopic surgery.","Qureshi, Irfan; Awad, Ziat T",The American surgeon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20836340/,404

Few studies have employed immunocytochemistry (ICC) to examine tissue from patients with CD for microbial antigens. We investigated 36 formalin-fixed tissues from 16 patients with CD with ICC. No evidence of adenovirus, Borrelia, Brucella, BVDV, Campylobacter, Campylobacter-like organisms, Chlamydia, coronavirus, CMV, EBV, Legionella, mycobacteria, Pseudomonas, rotavirus, Salmonella, Shigella, staphylococci, Toxoplasma gondii, Treponema, or Yersinia was found. ICC identified E. coli and streptococcal antigens in 11 (69%) and 10 (63%) of the 16 cases studied, respectively. Escherichia coli immunoreactivity was located in ulcers, within the lamina propria, and along fissures. Streptococcal immunolabeling occurred within mucosal epithelial cells, in the lamina propria, in ulcers, along fissures, in granulomatous inflammation including multinucleate giant cells, and in lymph nodes. These results suggest that some of the granulomas in CD may result from immunologic processing of bacterial antigens following their penetration through a compromised mucosa. E. coli and streptococcal antigens may contribute to the pathogenesis of CD.","Cartun, R W; Van Kruiningen, H J; Pedersen, C A; Berman, M M","Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8483893/,404

A one-step reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting a 730-base pair fragment of the nucleocapsid (N) gene of BCV and a nested PCR targeting a 407-base pair fragment of the N gene were used in an attempt to detect TOCV from North Carolina, Indiana, and a prototype turkey coronavirus (TCV) obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Both the one-step RT-PCR and the nested PCR amplified cell culture-passaged isolates of calf diarrhea strains of BCV but none of the 15 tested TOCVs or transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus of swine. TOCVs also did not cross-react in a BCV antigen-capture (AC) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against N, spike glycoprotein, and hemagglutinin esterase glycoprotein proteins of BCV as coating antibodies. The same TOCVs could be detected with primers designed from the genome of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) of chickens. These primers amplified a 1082-base pair region spanning portions of the membrane glycoprotein (M) and N protein genes of IBV and TCV. The TOCVs also cross-reacted in an AC-ELISA with MAbs against the M and subunit 2 of spike glycoprotein of IBV.","Ismail, M M; Cho, K O; Hasoksuz, M; Saif, L J; Saif, Y M",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11785902/,404

RECENT FINDINGS The importance of an adequate assessment of the inflammatory process and the appearance of inflammatory markers that correlate with the severity of pneumonia is underlined. A recent randomized clinical trial indicates that adjunctive treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia with glucocorticoids reduces complications and improves survival. The role of glucocorticoids in other lung infections is also reviewed. The design of new compounds with similar anti-inflammatory properties to classical glucocorticoids but with significantly fewer side effects constitutes a specific challenge for the near future. SUMMARY Although adjunctive treatment with glucocorticoids in severe pneumonia is probably indicated, further randomized clinical trials are urgently needed to confirm the preliminary positive results. In this regard, a proper evaluation of the inflammatory response is likely to be essential for the accurate selection of the target population.","Rañó, Ana; Agustí, Carlos; Sibila, Oriol; Torres, Antoni",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16514343/,404
201376,Home management of acute multiple sclerosis outbreak: Adaptation to coronavirus pandemic,2021,"With a rising incidence of obesity in the United States, anesthesiologists are faced with a larger volume of obese patients coming to the operating room as well as obese patients with ever-larger body mass indices (BMIs). While there are many cardiovascular and endocrine issues that clinicians must take into account when caring for the obese patient, one of the most prominent concerns of the anesthesiologist in the perioperative setting should be the status of the lung. Because the pathophysiology of reduced lung volumes in the obese patient differs from that of the ARDS patient, the best approach to keeping the obese patient's lung open and adequately ventilated during mechanical ventilation is unique. Although strong evidence and research are lacking regarding how to best ventilate the obese surgical patient, we aim with this review to provide an assessment of the small amount of research that has been conducted and the pathophysiology we believe influences the apparent results. We will provide a basic overview of the anatomy and pathophysiology of the obese respiratory system and review studies concerning pre-, intra-, and postoperative respiratory care. Our focus in this review centers on the best approach to keeping the lung recruited through the prevention of compression atelectasis and the maintaining of physiological lung volumes. We recommend the use of PEEP via noninvasive ventilation (NIV) before induction and endotracheal intubation, the use of both PEEP and periodic recruitment maneuvers during mechanical ventilation, and the use of PEEP via NIV after extubation. It is our hope that by studying the underlying mechanisms that make ventilating obese patients so difficult, future research can be better tailored to address this increasingly important challenge to the field of anesthesia.","Imber, David Ae; Pirrone, Massimiliano; Zhang, Changsheng; Fisher, Daniel F; Kacmarek, Robert M; Berra, Lorenzo",Respiratory care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27624632/,404

METHODS One-step reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to amplify the SARS RNA in the clinical specimens from different courses of the disease. The representative amplicons were then sequenced. Chi-square for trend test was performed to study the correlation between positive rates of RT-PCR and at different periods after the onset of the disease. RESULTS The fragments amplified from the sputum specimens of SARS patients were shown to share 100% homology with the published SARS-associated coronavirus. Of the different clinical specimens, positive rate in the stools appeared to be the highest (21.55%). Chi-square for trend test revealed that the positive rates of stools and sputa of SARS patients decreased with the development of the disease (chi(2) for trend = 12.55 and 16.408, P = 0.0004 and P = 0.000 05 respectively). CONCLUSION One-step RT-PCR proved to be an effective method for the detection of SARS-associated coronavirus from clinical specimens.

The infectivity was rescued in trans by cotransfecting COS-1 cells with short RNA transcripts of the wild-type 5'-UTR of poliovirus type 2 Lansing, provided a free 3'-OH was available. Direct sequencing of the viral RNA revealed that the infectious viruses recovered were recombinants Lansing/Mahoney, with variable points of 'crossing-over'. A novel mechanism of RNA-RNA recombination, which we propose to call 'primer alignment-and-extension', is described that would explain the high rate of recombination of RNA viruses observed in natural conditions.","Pierangeli, A; Bucci, M; Forzan, M; Pagnotti, P; Equestre, M; Pérez Bercoff, R",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10466784/,404

METHODS: Two-hundred-fifty-one patients with respiratory symptoms underwent CT few days after hospitalization. ""Aerated"" (AV), ""consolidated"" (CV) and ""intermediate"" (IV) lung sub-volumes were quantified by an operator-independent method based on individual HU maximum gradient recognition. AV, CV, IV, CV/AV, IV/AV, and HU of the first peak position were extracted. Relevant clinical parameters were prospectively collected. The population was composed by training (n = 166) and validation (n = 85) consecutive cohorts, and backward multi-variate logistic regression was applied on the training group to build a CT_model. Similarly, models including only clinical parameters (CLIN_model) and both CT/clinical parameters (COMB_model) were developed. Model's performances were assessed by goodness-of-fit (H&L-test), calibration and discrimination. Model's performances were tested in the validation group. RESULTS: Forty-three patients died (25/18 in training/validation). CT_model included AVmax (i.e. maximum AV between lungs), CV and CV/AE, while CLIN_model included random glycemia, C-reactive protein and biological drugs (protective). Goodness-of-fit and discrimination were similar (H&L:0.70 vs 0.80; AUC:0.80 vs 0.80). COMB_model including AVmax, CV, CV/AE, random glycemia, biological drugs and active cancer, outperformed both models (H&L:0.91; AUC:0.89, 95%CI:0.82-0.93). All models showed good calibration (R2:0.77-0.97). Despite several patient's characteristics were different between training and validation cohorts, performances in the validation cohort confirmed good calibration (R2:0-70-0.81) and discrimination for CT_model/COMB_model (AUC:0.72/0.76), while CLIN_model performed worse (AUC:0.64).

Machine learning methods could be used to extract implicit knowledge from the logs. Industries and businesses use the knowledge to better understand the consumer behavior, and opportunities and threats correspondingly. The outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has a great impact on the different aspects of our daily life, in particular, on our shopping behaviour. To predict electronic consumer behaviour could be of valuable help for managers in government, supply chain and retail industry. Although, before coronavirus pandemic we have experienced online shopping, during the disease the number of online shopping increased dramatically. Due to high speed transmission of COVID-19, we have to observe personal and social health issues such as social distancing and staying at home. These issues have direct effect on consumer behaviour in online shopping. In this paper, a prediction model is proposed to anticipate the consumers behaviour using machine learning methods. Five individual classifiers, and their ensembles with Bagging and Boosting are examined on the dataset collected from an online shopping site. The results indicate the model constructed using decision tree ensembles with Bagging achieved the best prediction of consumer behavior with the accuracy of 95.3%.

206236,Effects of Video-Guided Group vs. Solitary Meditation on Mindfulness and Social Connectivity: A Pilot Study,2021,"RATIONALE: During the COVID-19 pandemic's spring surge, many lung cancer screening (LCS) programs delayed scans. Upon resuming screening, programs pivoted to telemedicine for shared decision-making (SDM) to minimize COVID transmission risks. This can lead to a cascade of alterations in LCS implementation, exacerbating disparities in screening. We hypothesize these changes have altered the sociodemographic characteristics of our LCS population. METHODS: At our institution in Philadelphia, LCS was deferred beginning March 18, 2020. We analyzed data from patients living in Philadelphia undergoing LCS through our centralized program upon resumption of screening on May 18 and the subsequent 6 months. Patient-level sociodemographic characteristics were compared with a “Pre-COVID” cohort screened May-November 2019. Geospatial analysis was performed for neighborhood-level internet access among patients receiving SDM inperson vs. telemedicine. RESULTS: The 408 patients screened after program reopening had a mean age of 64.2±5.8 years, 246 patients (60.3%) were female, 204 (50.1%) were White and 196 (48.2%) were Black/African-American. Over half were current smokers (n=224, 54.9%), and 172 patients (42.2%) had COPD. Compared with the Pre-COVID cohort, the Post-reopening cohort had no statistically significant differences in age, sex, race, smoking status or intensity, BMI, COPD, personal or family history of lung cancer, or insurance status. Education was significantly different between the two groups, with the Post-reopening cohort comprised of a lower percentage of patients with &lt;HS education (16.9% vs. 11.3%), a greater frequency of patients with a HS diploma (42.6% vs. 46.1%), and fewer patients with education beyond HS (39.2% vs. 35.2%) (p&lt;0.001). There was no significant difference in mean PLCOm2012 lung cancer risk (6.5±5.6% vs. 6.4±5.7%) or frequency of positive screens (≥Lung-RADS 3;8.9% vs. 8.4%). After excluding follow-up patients, education remained the only significant difference between groups. Analysis of neighborhood-level household internet access revealed no difference in the number of patients from census tracts with the lowest availability of household internet. Among the 15 census tracts with the greatest loss of patients from Pre-COVID to Postreopening, only 26.7% were in the highest quartile of internet deficit. CONCLUSIONS: LCS disparities can include disproportionate underscreening of individuals who are Black/African-American, live in rural areas, or have low socioeconomic status. Despite significant changes to our LCS program's workflow, the only significant difference between our Pre-COVID and Post-reopening cohorts was education level. Future research should be directed toward developing strategies to support LCS-eligible patients with low levels of education in the era of telemedicine.","Shusted, C. S.; Juon, H.; Ruane, B.

Second, in the active response phase, when the number of confirmed persons and the government's countermeasures were announced, more than 100 COVID-19-related articles were issued, and the related words increased rapidly from the initial response stage. Therefore, the fact that COVID-19 has been expressed as a keyword indicates that our society is watching with great interest in the government's response to the disease.","Jung, Ji-Hee; Shin, Jae-Ik",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,404

Cases reported from Hospital de Emergencias Villa el Salvador, Lima-Peru",2020,"INTRODUCTION: The pandemic has had an impact on colorectal cancer surgery in hospitals. In 2020, up to 75% of colorectal cancer patients are estimated to require surgery. No objective data on the impact of the pandemic on the management of surgical waiting lists is available. We conducted a survey in colorectal surgery units to assess the impact on colorectal cancer surgery waiting lists. METHOD: All personnel in charge of colorectal surgery units nationwide received a survey (from February to April, 2020) with eight questions divided into three sections-cessation date of colorectal cancer surgeries, number of patients waiting for treatment, and use of neoadjuvant therapy to postpone surgery. RESULTS: Sixty-seven units participated in the study, with 79.1% of units ceasing some type of activity (32.8% total and 46.3% partial cessation) and 20.9% continuing all surgical activity. In addition, 65% of units used or prolonged neoadjuvant therapy in rectal cancer patients and 40% of units performed at least five emergency colorectal cancer surgeries. It was estimated that at least one month of intense surgical activity will be required to catch up. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, patients from units with a long waiting list must be redistributed, at least within the country. In the future, in the event of a second wave of the pandemic, an effective program to manage each unit's resources should be developed to prevent total collapse.","de la Portilla de Juan, Fernando; Reyes Díaz, María Luisa; Ramallo Solía, Irene",Cir.

Design: Single-center descriptive cohort study from April 21, to July 7, 2020. Setting: Critical care recovery clinic at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Patients: Adults who had critical illness due to coronavirus disease 2019 requiring an ICU stay of 7 days or more and who agreed to a telehealth follow-up in the critical care recovery clinic 1-month post hospital discharge. INTERVENTIONS: None. Measures and Main Results: Patient-reported outcome measures assessing physical and psychiatric domains were collected electronically, a cognitive test was performed by a clinician, and clinical data were obtained through electronic medical records. Outcome measures assessed postintensive care syndrome symptoms in the physical (Modified Rankin Scale, Dalhousie Clinical Frailty Scale, Neuro-Quality of Life Upper Extremity and Lower Extremity Function, Neuro-Quality of Life Fatigue), psychiatric (Insomnia Severity Scale; Patient Health Questionnaire-9; and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition), and cognitive (Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment) domains. The 3-Level Version of Euro-QoL-5D was used to assess the physical and psychiatric domains. A diagnosis of postintensive care syndrome was made in cases with evidence of impairment in at least one postintensive care syndrome domain. We included 45 patients with a mean (SD) age of 54 (13) years, and 73% were male. Ninety-one percent of coronavirus disease 2019 ICU survivors fit diagnostic criteria for postintensive care syndrome. 86.7 % had impairments in the physical domain, 22 (48%) reported impairments in the psychiatric domain, and four (8%) had impairments on cognitive screening. We found that 58% had some degree of mobility impairment. In the psychiatric domain, 38% exhibited at least mild depression, and 18 % moderate to severe depression. Eighteen percent presented Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, scores suggestive of posttraumatic stress syndrome diagnosis. In the Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment, 9% had impaired cognition. Conclusions: Survivors of critical illness related to coronavirus disease 2019 are at high risk of developing postintensive care syndrome. These findings highlight the importance of planning for appropriate post-ICU care to diagnose and treat this population.","Martillo, Miguel; Dangayach, Neha; Tabacof, Laura; Spielman, Lisa A; Dams-O039,; Connor, Kristen; Chan, Christy C; Kohli-Seth, Roopa; Cortes, Mar; Escalon, Miguel X",Crit. care med,,404

This study aimed to elicit HCWs' perceptions of the adequacy of protective measures in high-risk clinical areas and the factors associated with these perceptions. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in April 2020. An anonymous electronic survey was sent via email to operating theatre (OT) and intensive care unit (ICU) staff of Sengkang General Hospital, Singapore. RESULTS: Of the 358 eligible participants, 292 (81.6%) responded to the survey. 93.2% of the participants felt that precautionary measures at work were sufficient and 94.9% acknowledged that adequate training was provided. More than 60% of the participants opined that their chances of contracting COVID-19 were moderate to high. Female gender, nursing occupation and duration of service < 10 years were significantly associated with increased fear of contracting COVID-19, less control over occupational exposure and lower perceived need to care for COVID-19 patients. Having young children at home did not significantly affect these perceptions. The most important ICU precautions were availability of personal protective equipment outside the rooms of COVID-19 positive patients (95.3%) and having visitor restrictions (95.3%). The most important OT measures were having a dedicated OT for COVID-19 positive patients (91.2%) and having simulation as part of protocol familiarisation (91.7%). CONCLUSION: Overall, there was high confidence in the adequacy of COVID-19 protective measures to prevent healthcare transmission in Singapore. The pandemic had a lower degree of psycho-emotional impact on HCWs here as compared to other countries.","Au-Yong, Phui-Sze Angie; Peh, Wee-Ming; Koh, Frederick Hong-Xiang; Teo, Li-Ming; Ng, Siok-Peng; Tan, Alina Li-Na; Ng, Aven Shan-Hua; Chew, Min-Hoe",Singap. med. j,,404

This study aimed to perform an in-depth analysis of a catastrophic coach crash that occurred on the Chinese expressway, and thus draw useful lessons to avoid similar mistakes. Methods. Various causes were identified from the investigation report based on a proposed accident causation model, which provides a universal pathway for accident analysis from the individual level to the organizational level. Results. Driver error in an emergency affected by fatigue and speeding led directly to the crash. Accordingly, drivers in coaches should be monitored effectively and their unsafe acts must be corrected in a timely manner to avoid the formation of unsafe habits. Based on individual flaws, weaknesses in the construction of the organizational safety management system and safety culture were further deduced and discussed. Conclusion. The work and rest system, as well as the dynamic monitoring system for drivers, should be perfected strictly according to the regulations. Additionally, external factors regarding deficiencies in the design and management of the expressway and the supervision of the transportation company also had great impact on this crash. In summary, more efforts should be taken regarding root causes at the organizational level, regardless of internal or external factors.","Wang, Jianhao; Fu, Gui; Yan, Mingwei",Int J Occup Saf Ergon,,404

216797,[Gynecologic surgery in the era of COVID-19 - Recommendations for deconfinement],2020,"INTRODUCTION: Severe acquired brain injury(SABI) often results in the deterioration of physical, cognitive and emotional functions in the patient and a significant caregiver's distress syndrome, which is now amplified by the social isolation, depression and financial difficulties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of web-based online-therapy has been shown to be useful to overcome caregiver's distress syndrome and further stimulate cognitive-motor recovery of SABI-patients. Our study aimed to investigate whether a systematic online Skype-therapy(OLST) may be of support in favoring global cognitive and sensory-motor recovery in SABI-patients and reducing caregiver distress. METHODS: Twenty-five SABI-subjects in inpatient regimen were provided with intensive OLST with the caregiver for 12 weeks in addition to standard neurorehabilitation. Each subject and caregiver was evaluated before and after the treatment by administering an ad hoc battery. Furthermore, 18 of 27 patients were provided with EEG recording in resting state. RESULTS: We found a significant reduction in caregiver's anxiety (p<0.0001) and burden(p<0.0001). Patients showed significant improvement in trunk control (p<0.0001), functional independence (p = 0.005), functional (p = 0.01) and global communication (p = 0.004), cognitive functioning (p = 0.001), and behavioral responsiveness (p = 0.0004). The training yielded a significant connectivity change within the fronto-centro-parietal areas in the delta frequency band (p<0.0001) and the centro-parieto-occipital areas in the alpha range (p = 0.004). DISCUSSION: OLST may be a useful and complementary treatment to optimize global cognitive and functional recovery in SABI-subjects and reduce caregivers' concerns in the Covid-era. OLST can foster cognitive-motor recovery potentially by favoring the plasticity-dependent functional recovery. Therefore, OLST could be proposed as a tool allowing social conversations also in the hospital setting.","De Luca, Rosaria; Rifici, Carmela; Pollicino, Patrizia; Di Cara, Marcella; Miceli, Sabrina; Sergi, Giuseppina; Sorrenti, Luisa; Romano, Michela; Naro, Antonino; Billeri, Luana; Lauria, Paola; Caminiti, Angelo; Bramanti, Placido; Torrisi, Michele",J Telemed Telecare,,404

Autophagy dysregulation plays crucial roles during HS formation. The overexpressed p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in injured skin tissue after wound healing becomes a factor aggravating scar. The study was designed to investigate the role of p75NTR and p75NTR-mediated autophagy in the process of HS. The results revealed that p75NTR expression was significantly upregulated while that of autophagy proteins was downregulated in cicatrix at 3 and 6 months after burn, which was recovered at 12 months. p75NTR silencing inhibited proliferation, migration and ECM deposition of hypertrophic scar fibroblasts (HSF), whereas p75NTR overexpression presented the opposite results. Silencing of p75NTR reduced the expression of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling molecules while enhanced that of autophagy proteins. Importantly, PI3K agonist (IGF-1) intervention notably decreased the levels of LC3B II/I and Beclin-1, and restored the inhibitory effects of p75NTR silencing on proliferation, migration and ECM deposition of HSF. Concurrently, autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) treatment exhibited the same variation trends with IGF-1. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that p75NTR silencing inhibits proliferation, migration and ECM deposition of HSF by activating autophagy through inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.","Shi, Wen; Wu, Yan; Bian, Donghui",Can. j. physiol. pharmacol,,404
222648,Tracking the characteristics of economic growth vulnerability to covid-19: A preliminary analysis,2020,"Lung-secreted IgG and IgM antibodies are valuable biomarkers for monitoring the local immune response against respiratory infections. These biomarkers are found in lower airway secretions that need to be liquefied prior to analysis. Traditional methods for sample liquefaction rely on reducing disulfide bonds, which may damage the structure of the biomarkers and hamper their immunodetection. Here, we propose an alternative enzymatic method that uses O2 bubbles generated by endogenous catalase enzymes in order to liquefy respiratory samples. The proposed method is more efficient for liquefying medium- and high-viscosity samples and does not fragment the antibodies. This prevents damage to antigen recognition domains and recognition sites for secondary antibodies that can decrease the signal of immunodetection techniques. The suitability of the enzymatic method for detecting antibodies in respiratory samples is demonstrated by detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM to viral N-protein with gold standard ELISA in bronchial aspirate specimens from a multicenter cohort of 44 COVID-19 patients. The enzymatic detection sharply increases the sensitivity toward IgG and IgM detection compared to the traditional approach based on liquefying samples with dithiothreitol. This improved performance could reveal new mechanisms of the early local immune response against respiratory infections that may have gone unnoticed with current sample treatment methods.","Clemente, Antonio; Alba-Patiño, Alejandra; Santopolo, Giulia; Rojo-Molinero, Estrella; Oliver, Antonio; Borges, Marcio; Aranda, María; Del Castillo, Alberto; de la Rica, Roberto",Anal Chem,,404

224270,Effect on mental health due to covid 19,2020,"Despite the recognized important ecological role that cetaceans play in the marine environment, their protection is still scarcely enforced in the Mediterranean Sea even though this area is strongly threatened by local human pressures and climate change. The piecemeal of knowledge related to cetaceans' ecology and distribution in the basin undermines the capacity of addressing cetaceans' protection and identifying effective conservation strategies. In this study, an Ecosystem-Based Marine Spatial Planning (EB-MSP) approach is applied to assess human pressures on cetaceans and guide the designation of a conservation area in the Gulf of Taranto, Northern Ionian Sea (Central-eastern Mediterranean Sea). The Gulf of Taranto hosts different cetacean species that accomplish important phases of their life in the area. Despite this fact, the gulf does not fall within any area-based management tools (ABMTs) for cetacean conservation. We pin down the Gulf of Taranto being eligible for the designation of diverse ABMTs for conservation, both legally and non-legally binding. Through a risk-based approach, this study explores the cause-effect relationships that link any human activities and pressures exerted in the study area to potential effects on cetaceans, by identifying major drivers of potential impacts. These were found to be underwater noise, marine litter, ship collision, and competition and disturbance on preys.

Initial evidence suggests one of the effects is crime rates, which appear to have fallen drastically in many communities around the world. We argue that the principal reason for the change is the government ordered stay-at-home orders, which impacted the routine activities of entire populations. Because these orders impacted countries, states, and communities at different times and in different ways, a naturally occurring, quasi-randomized control experiment has unfolded, allowing the testing of criminological theories as never before. Using new and traditional data sources made available as a result of the pandemic criminologists are equipped to study crime in society as never before. We encourage researchers to study specific types of crime, in a temporal fashion (following the stay-at-home orders), and placed-based. The results will reveal not only why, where, when, and to what extent crime changed, but also how to influence future crime reduction.","Stickle, Ben; Felson, Marcus",Am J Crim Justice,,404

Most often at the origin of a mild infectious syndrome, associating mild symptoms (fever, cough, myalgia, headache and possible digestive disorders) to different degrees, SARS-Covid-2 can cause serious pulmonary pathologies and sometimes death. Data on the consequences during pregnancy are limited. The first Chinese data published seem to show that the symptoms in pregnant women are the same as those of the general population. There are no cases of intrauterine maternal-fetal transmission, but cases of newborns infected early suggest that there could be vertical perpartum or neonatal transmission. Induced prematurity and cases of respiratory distress in newborns of infected mothers have been described. Pregnancy is known as a period at higher risk for the consequences of respiratory infections, as for influenza, so it seems important to screen for Covid-19 in the presence of symptoms and to monitor closely pregnant women. In this context of the SARS-Covid-2 epidemic, the societies of gynecology-obstetrics, infectious diseases and neonatalogy have proposed a French protocol for the management of possible and proven cases of SARS-Covid-2 in pregnant women. These proposals may evolve on a daily basis with the advancement of the epidemic and knowledge in pregnant women. Subsequently, an in-depth analysis of cases in pregnant women will be necessary in order to improve knowledge on the subject.","Peyronnet, V; Sibiude, J; Deruelle, P; Huissoud, C; Lescure, X; Lucet, J-C; Mandelbrot, L; Nisand, I; Vayssière, C; Yazpandanah, Y; Luton, D; Picone, O",Gynecol Obstet Fertil Senol,,404

Although there have been several reviews published on COVID-19 and health disparities across various populations, none has focused on sexual health. We plan to conduct a scoping review that seeks to fill several of the gaps in the current knowledge of sexual health in the COVID-19 era. METHODS: A scoping review focusing on sexual health and COVID-19 will be conducted. We will search (from January 2020 onwards) CINAHL, Africa-Wide Information, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Gender Studies Database, Gender Watch, Global Health, WHO Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease Database, WHO Global Index Medicus, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Sociological Abstracts. Grey literature will be identified using Disaster Lit, Google Scholar, governmental websites, and clinical trials registries (e.g., ClinicalTrial.gov , World Health Organization, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Registry).

As there is no effective drug or vaccine, it is urgent to find therapeutic drugs that can serve to deal with the current epidemic situation in all countries and regions. We searched drugs and response measures for SARS-CoV-2 in the PubMed database, and then updated the potential targets and therapeutic drugs from the perspective of the viral replication cycle. The drug research studies of the viral replication cycle are predominantly focused on the process of the virus entering cells, proteases, and RdRp. The inhibitors of the virus entry to cells and RdRp, such as Arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, EIDD-2081, and ribavirin, are in clinical trials, while most of the protease inhibitors are mainly calculated by molecular docking technology, which needs in vivo and in vitro experiments to prove the effect for SARS-CoV-2. This review summarizes the drugs targeting the viral replication process and provides a basis and directions for future drug development and reuse on the protein level of COVID-19.","Zhang, Yi; Tang, Liang V",J Proteome Res,,404

232174,Assessing the practicality of the COVID-19 social distancing guidelines to the urban poor in the Ghanaian context,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The BCG vaccine, widely used in Brazil in new-borns, induces adjuvant protection for several diseases, including childhood virus infections. BCG activates monocytes and innate memory NK cells which are crucial for the antiviral immune response. Therefore, strategies to prevent COVID-19 in health workers (HW) should be carried out to prevent them becoming unwell so that they can continue to work during the pandemic. The hypothesis is that BCG will improve the innate immune response and prevent symptomatic infection or COVID-19 severity. The primary objective is to verify the effectiveness and safety of the BCG vaccine to prevent or reduce incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the city of Goiânia (Brazil) among HW previously vaccinated with BCG and also its severity and mortality during the pandemic of the disease. Secondary objectives are to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 among these professionals and the innate immune response elicited to BCG. TRIAL DESIGN: This a phase II trial for repositioning BCG as a preventive strategy against COVID-19. The trial is an open-label, parallel-group randomised clinical trial, comparing HW vaccinated with BCG and HW not vaccinated. PARTICIPANTS: The trial will recruit 800 HW of Goiânia - Goiás, Brazil to reach a total of 400 HW included after comorbidities questioning and laboratorial evaluation. Eligibility criteria: Any HW presenting BCG vaccination scar with direct contact with suspected COVID-19 patients for at least 8 hours per week, whether in hospital beds, ICU, or in transportation or admission (nurses, doctors, physiotherapists, nutritionists, receptionists, etc.) who have negative IgM and IgG COVID-19 test. Participants with any of the following characteristics will be excluded: - Have had in the last fifteen days any signs or symptoms of virus infection, including COVID-19; - Have had fever in the last fifteen days; - Have been vaccinated fifteen days before the inclusion; - Have a history or confirmation of any immunosuppressive disease such as HIV, presented solid tumour in the last two years or autoimmune diseases; - Are under preventive medication with antibiotics, steroid anti-inflammatories, or chemotherapy; - Have less than 500 neutrophils per mL of blood; - Have previously been diagnosed with tuberculosis; - Are breastfeeding or pregnant; - Are younger than 18 years old; - Are participating as an investigator in this clinical trial. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: HW will be randomized into the BCG vaccinated group or the BCG unvaccinated control group. The BCG vaccinated group will receive in the right arm, intradermally, a one off dose of 0.1 mL corresponding to approximately 2 x105 to 8 x105 CFU of live, freeze-dried, attenuated BCG Moscow 361-I, Bacillus Calmette Guerin vaccine (Serum Institute of India PVT. LTD.). The unvaccinated control group will not be vaccinated. The HW allocated in both groups will be followed up at specific times points until 180 days post inclusion. The vaccinated and control groups will be compared according to COVID-19 related outcomes. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcomes are the incidence coefficient of infection by SARS-CoV-2 determined by RT-PCR of naso-oropharyngeal swab specimen or rapid lateral flow IgG and IgM test, and presence of general COVID-19 symptoms, disease severity and admission to hospital during the 180 days of follow up. The secondary outcome is the innate immune response elicited 15-20 days after vaccination. RANDOMISATION: The vaccine vial contains approximately 10 doses. In order to optimize the vaccine use, the randomisation was performed in blocks of 20 participants using the platform randomization.com [ http://www.jerrydallal.com/random/permute.htm ]. The randomization was prepared before any HW inclusion. The results were printed and inserted in sealed envelopes that were numbered with BCG-001 to BCG-400. The printed results as well the envelopes had the same numbers. At the time of the randomisation, each participant that meets the inclusion criteria will receive a consecutive participant number [BCG-001-BCG-400]. The sealed envelope with the assigned number, blinded to the researchers, will be opened in front of the participant and the arm allocation will be known. BLINDING (MASKING): There is no masking for the participants or for the healthcare providers. The study will be blinded to the laboratory researchers and to those who will be evaluating the outcomes and performing the statistical analyses. In this case, only the participant identification number will be available. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): Four hundred heath workers will be randomised in two groups. Two hundred participants will be vaccinated, and 200 participants will not be vaccinated. TRIAL STATUS: The protocol approved by the Brazilian Ethical Committee is the seventh version, number CAAE: 31783720.0.0000.5078. The trial has been recruiting since September 20th, 2020. The clinical trial protocol was registered on August 5th, 2020. It is estimated that recruitment will finish by March 2021.

This paper introduces a novel Deep Fusion of Dynamic and Static Information model (DFDS) to effectively forecast the charging station occupation. We exploit static information, such as the mean occupation concerning the time of day, to learn the specific charging station patterns. We supplement such static data with dynamic information reflecting the preceding charging station occupation and temporal information such as daytime and weekday. Our model efficiently fuses dynamic and static information to facilitate accurate forecasting. We evaluate the proposed model on a real-world dataset containing 593 charging stations in Germany, covering August 2020 to December 2020. Our experiments demonstrate that DFDS outperforms the baselines by 3.45 percent points in F1-score on average.","Sao, Ashutosh; Tempelmeier, Nicolas; Demidova, Elena",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12352v1.pdf,404

Post coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms are more frequent than initially expected, with fatigue as an often-mentioned issue. CASE PRESENTATIONS: We describe a 32-year-old white male and a 55-year-old white female who suffered from post coronavirus disease 2019 fatigue syndrome. On polysomnography, rapid eye movement associated sleep apnea with an increased hypopnea index during rapid eye movement phases of 36.8 and 19.5 events per hour was found. Based on the patients' burdensome fatigue symptoms, we initiated automatic positive airway pressure therapy, which diminished sleep apnea (rapid eye movement index: 0.0 in both patients) and, consequently, also the fatigue symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Since sleep apnea and coronavirus disease 2019 are both associated with fatigue, a screening for sleep apnea might be considered in coronavirus disease 2019 patients with fatigue syndrome.","Koczulla, Andreas Rembert; Stegemann, Antje; Gloeckl, Rainer; Winterkamp, Sandra; Sczepanski, Bernd; Boeselt, Tobias; Storre, Jan; Dreher, Michael",J Med Case Rep,,404
234576,Neo-liberal reforms in higher education accelerated by the pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Avidity is defined as the strength of binding between immunoglobulin G (IgG) and its specific target epitope. IgG of high avidity is established during affinity maturation. Failure to achieve high avidity IgG may result in a lack of protective immunity towards infection and disease. It is known that the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its cellular receptor is driven by high affinity. Therefore, it is predictable that protective antibodies towards SARS-CoV-2 should show high affinity/avidity. AVIDITY AFTER SARS-COV-2 INFECTION: Recent findings by several groups demonstrate that the serological response towards infection with SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses is characterized by incomplete avidity maturation, followed by a decline of the serological response. This response might facilitate reinfection, prevent herd immunity and potentially allow repeated cycles of infection. CONSEQUENCES FOR VACCINATION TOWARDS SARS-COV-2: Therefore, the sole focus on antibody titers reached after vaccination towards SARS-CoV-2 might not be sufficient to evaluate the degree of achieved protection. Rather, it is suggested to include avidity determination to optimize vaccination protocols and achieve high avidity IgG directed towards SARS-CoV-2 through vaccination. Avidity determination might also be useful to control for truly protective immunity towards SARS-CoV-2 in individual cases.","Bauer, Georg",Int J Infect Dis,,404

As in other contexts, the debate has been the subject of several d/misinformation campaigns; in a quite unprecedented fashion, however, the presence of false information has seriously put at risk the public health. In this sense, detecting the presence of malicious narratives and identifying the kinds of users that are more prone to spread them represent the first step to limit the persistence of the former ones. In the present paper we analyse the semantic network observed on Twitter during the first Italian lockdown (induced by the hashtags contained in approximately 1.5 millions tweets published between the 23rd of March 2020 and the 23rd of April 2020) and study the extent to which various discursive communities are exposed to d/misinformation arguments. As observed in other studies, the recovered discursive communities largely overlap with traditional political parties, even if the debated topics concern different facets of the management of the pandemic. Although the themes directly related to d/misinformation are a minority of those discussed within our semantic networks, their popularity is unevenly distributed among the various discursive communities.","Mattei, Mattia; Caldarelli, Guido; Squartini, Tiziano; Saracco, Fabio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05815v1.pdf,404
236138,COVID-19 progression: Waiting for the eureka moment,2020,"Nucleoside modified mRNA combined with Acuitas Therapeutics lipid nanoparticles (LNP) have been shown to support robust humoral immune responses in many preclinical animal vaccine studies and later in humans with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. We recently showed that this platform is highly inflammatory due to the LNPs ionizable lipid component. The inflammatory property is key to support the development of potent humoral immune responses. However, the mechanism by which this platform drives T follicular helper cells (Tfh) and humoral immune responses remains unknown. Here we show that lack of Langerhans cells or cDC1s neither significantly affected the induction of PR8 HA and SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific Tfh cells and humoral immune responses, nor susceptibility towards the lethal challenge of influenza and SARS-CoV-2. However, the combined deletion of these two DC subsets led to a significant decrease in the induction of PR8 HA and SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific Tfh cell and humoral immune responses. Despite these observed defects, the still high antibody titers were sufficient to confer protection towards lethal viral challenges. We further found that IL-6, but not neutrophils, was required to generate Tfh cells and antibody responses. In summary, here we bring evidence that the mRNA-LNP platform can support protective adaptive immune responses in the absence of specific DC subsets through an IL-6 dependent and neutrophil independent mechanism.","Ndeupen, Sonia; Bouteau, Aurelie; Herbst, Christopher; Qin, Zhen; Hutchins, Zachary; Kurup, Drishya; Diba, Leila Zabihi; Igyarto, Botond",,,404

The detection of self-reported symptoms is of major importance for emergent diseases like the Covid-19. In this study, we aimed to (1) develop an algorithm based on fuzzy matching to detect symptoms in tweets, (2) establish a comprehensive list of Covid-19-related symptoms and (3) evaluate the fuzzy matching for Covid-19-related symptom detection in French tweets. The Covid-19-related symptom list was built based on the aggregation of different data sources. French Covid-19-related tweets were automatically extracted using a dedicated data broker during the first wave of the pandemic in France. The fuzzy matching parameters were finetuned using all symptoms from MedDRA and then evaluated on a subset of 5000 Covid-19-related tweets in French for the detection of symptoms from our Covid-19-related list. The fuzzy matching improved the detection by the addition of 42% more correct matches with an 81% precision.","Faviez, Carole; Foulquié, Pierre; Chen, Xiaoyi; Mebarki, Adel; Quennelle, Sophie; Texier, Nathalie; Katsahian, Sandrine; Schuck, Stéphane; Burgun, Anita",Stud Health Technol Inform,,404

Proper management and disposal of health care wastes (HCWs) are critical to win the fight. To achieve aforementioned tasks, prediction of their production is highly desired. In this study, primary data of production of three kinds of HCWs collected from Wuhan, the first epidemic epicenter worldwide and a mega city with more than 10 million population who has went through a lockdown period of 78 days, were reported for their first time. HCWs were classified into routine HCWs, infectious HCWs (IHCWs) and infectious municipal solid wastes. Among them, infectious HCWs from designated hospitals for COVID-19 were recognized as the most dangerous one. A multiple linear regression (MLR) model was built to predict the production of IHCWs with high significance. Numbers of patients were demonstrated high correlations with the production of IHCWs in an order of confirmed patients ï¼ out-patients ï¼ suspected patients. By the MLR model, production rates of IHCWs by confirmed, suspected and out patients were determined as 3.2, 1.8 and 0.1 kg/patient, respectively. In addition, constant production of IHCWs during the pandemic period was determined as 13 tons/d. This is the first study on quantitative evaluation of infectious HCWs during COVID-19 pandemic. The achievements in this study have potentials to shed light on global efforts to the prediction, management and disposal of vast HCWs generated in the war against COVID-19.","Wang, Jia; Chen, Zhuqi; Lang, Xiaojuan; Wang, Songlin; Yang, Lie; Wu, Xiaolong; Zhou, Xinquan; Chen, Zhulei",Waste Manag,,404

245257,"Asynchronous, digital teaching in times of COVID-19: a teaching example from general practice",2020,"Objective: In this study, we extend the impact of mindfulness to the concept of least-worst decision-making. Least-worst decisions involve high-uncertainty and require the individual to choose between a number of potentially negative courses of action. Research is increasingly exploring least-worst decisions, and real-world events (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) show the need for individuals to overcome uncertainty and commit to a least-worst course of action. From sports to business, researchers are increasingly showing that ""being mindful"" has a range of positive performance-related benefits. We hypothesized that mindfulness would improve least-worst decision-making because it would increase self-reflection and value identification. However, we also hypothesized that trait maximization (the tendency to attempt to choose the ""best"" course of action) would negatively interact with mindfulness. Methods: Three hundred and ninety-eight participants were recruited using Amazon MTurk and exposed to a brief mindfulness intervention or a control intervention (listening to an audiobook). After this intervention, participants completed the Least-Worst Uncertain Choice Inventory for Emergency Responders (LUCIFER). Results: As hypothesized, mindfulness increased decision-making speed and approach-tendencies. Conversely, for high-maximizers, increased mindfulness caused a slowing of the decision-making process and led to more avoidant choices. Conclusions: This study shows the potential positive and negative consequences of mindfulness for least-worst decision-making, emphasizing the critical importance of individual differences when considering both the effect of mindfulness and interventions aimed at improving decision-making.","Shortland, N.

However, most of the classical models fail to account for certain features of this disease and others like it, such as the ability of exposed individuals to recover without becoming infectious, or the possibility that asymptomatic individuals can indeed transmit the disease but at a lesser rate than the symptomatic. Furthermore, the rise of new disease variants and the imperfection of vaccines suggest that concept of endemic equilibrium is perhaps more pertinent than that of herd immunity. Here we propose a new compartmental epidemiological model and study its equilibria, characterizing the stability of both the endemic and disease-free equilibria in terms of the basic reproductive number. Moreover, we introduce a second compartmental model, generalizing our first, which accounts for vaccinated individuals, and begin an analysis of its equilibria.","Balisacan, Jonas; Chyba, Monique; Shanbrom, Corey",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.01738v1.pdf,404
245859,A review article on home remedies during covid-19 pandemic lockdown,2020,"Vision transformers have attracted much attention from computer vision researchers as they are not restricted to the spatial inductive bias of ConvNets. However, although Transformer-based backbones have achieved much progress on ImageNet classification, it is still unclear whether the learned representations are as transferable as or even more transferable than ConvNets' features. To address this point, we systematically investigate the transfer learning ability of ConvNets and vision transformers in 15 single-task and multi-task performance evaluations. Given the strong correlation between the performance of pre-trained models and transfer learning, we include 2 residual ConvNets (i.e., R-101x3 and R-152x4) and 3 Transformer-based visual backbones (i.e., ViT-B, ViT-L and Swin-B), which have close error rates on ImageNet, that indicate similar transfer learning performance on downstream datasets. We observe consistent advantages of Transformer-based backbones on 13 downstream tasks (out of 15), including but not limited to fine-grained classification, scene recognition (classification, segmentation and depth estimation), open-domain classification, face recognition, etc. More specifically, we find that two ViT models heavily rely on whole network fine-tuning to achieve performance gains while Swin Transformer does not have such a requirement. Moreover, vision transformers behave more robustly in multi-task learning, i.e., bringing more improvements when managing mutually beneficial tasks and reducing performance losses when tackling irrelevant tasks. We hope our discoveries can facilitate the exploration and exploitation of vision transformers in the future.","Zhou, Hong-Yu; Lu, Chixiang; Yang, Sibei; Yu, Yizhou",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05305v2.pdf,404

To overcome the lack of human resources during this crisis, some ICUs had to mobilise staff from a reinforcement pool, with no or outdated ICU experience. This study aimed to investigate and to compare the psychological impact of the pandemic on regular ICU staff members and reinforcement workers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Self-assessment questionnaires were completed by HCWs who worked from March 1 to April 30, 2020, in our 16-bed neurological ICU at La Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, France, which was converted to a COVID ICU. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5, McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire-Revised, and 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale were used to assess anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, quality of life, and resilience, respectively. RESULTS: Sixty-nine ICU HCWs completed the survey (37 from the team of regular staff members, i.e., from the public health service, and 32 from a reinforcement pool, either from non-ICU public health service or from private healthcare interim employment agencies). Prevalence of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms was high, at 19%, 9%, and 16%, respectively, with limited impairment in quality of life or resilience scores. Depression symptoms were observed more in regular staff members than in welcomed reinforcement workers, at 16% and 0%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results revealed that during the pandemic, HCWs from the team of regular staff members were at greater risk of developing psychological disorder compared with reinforcement workers, with higher levels of depressive symptoms.","Altmayer, Victor; Weiss, Nicolas; Cao, Albert; Marois, Clémence; Demeret, Sophie; Rohaut, Benjamin; Le Guennec, Loïc",Aust. crit. care,,404

Currently, there areno effective preventive or treatment strategies for COVID-19 and has been declared as a global health emergency by WHO. In silico molecular docking studies can be useful to predict the binding affinity between the phytocompound and the target protein and play a vital role in finding an inhibitor through structure-based drug design. OBJECTIVE: In this aspect, our objective was to screen essential flavonoids against possible protein targets such as SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain (RBD-S) and host Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 protease domain (PD-ACE-2) using in silico molecular docking studies. METHODS: Approximately 49 flavonoids were identified, evaluated for their drug likeness based on Lipinski rule, bioactivity scores, antiviral and toxicity profiles using SwissADME, Molinspiration, PASS and GUSAR online tools. The flavonoids that passed Lipinski rule were subjected to in silico analysis through molecular docking on RBD-S and PD-ACE-2 using Molegro Virtual Docker v6.0. RESULTS: The bioactive flavonoids that showed NIL violations and found in compliance with Lipinski rule were selected for docking studies. In silicoanalysis reported that biochanin A and silymarin bind significantly at the active sites of RBD-Sand PD-ACE-2 with a MolDock score of -78.41and -121.28 kcal/mol respectively. Bioactivity scores, antiviral potential and tox-icity profiles were predicted for the top interacting phytocompounds and substantial relevant data was reported. CONCLUSION: The current outcomes created a new paradigm in understanding biochanin A and silymarin bioflavonoids as potent inhibitors of RBD-Sand PD-ACE-2 targets respectively, further work can be extended to confirm their therapeutic potential in COVID-19.","Gorla, Uma Sankar; Rao, Gsn Koteswara; Kulandaivelu, Uma Sankar; Alavala, Rajasekhar Reddy; Panda, Siva Prasad",,,404

By analyzing plasma samples from 130 hemodialysis (HD) and 13 peritoneal dialysis patients after two doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines, we found that 35% of the patients had low-level or undetectable IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S). Neutralizing antibodies against the vaccine-matched SARS-CoV-2 and Delta variant were low or undetectable in 49% and 77% of patients, respectively, and were further reduced against other emerging variants. The fraction of non-responding patients was higher in SARS-CoV-2-naive HD patients immunized with BNT162b2 (66%) than those immunized with mRNA-1273 (23%). The reduced neutralizing activity correlated with low antibody avidity, consistent with a delayed affinity maturation of SARS-CoV-2 S-specific B cells. These data indicate that dialysis patients should be considered for an additional boost and other therapeutic strategies, including early immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies.","Bassi, Jessica; Giannini, Olivier; Silacci-Fregni, Chiara; Pertusini, Laura; Hitz, Paolo; Terrot, Tatiana; Franzosi, Yves; Muoio, Francesco; Saliba, Christian; Meury, Marcel; Dellota, Exequiel; Dillen, Josh; Hernandez, Patrick; Czudnochowski, Nadine; Cameroni, Elisabetta; Beria, Nicola; Ventresca, Mariangela; Badellino, Alberto; Lavorato-Hadjeres, Soraya; Lecchi, Elisabetta; Bonora, Tecla; Mattiolo, Matteo; Trinci, Guido; Garzoni, Daniela; Bonforte, Giuseppe; Forni-Ogna, Valentina; Giunzioni, Davide; Berwert, Lorenzo; Gupta, Ravindra K.; Ferrari, Paolo; Ceschi, Alessandro; Cippa', Pietro; Corti, Davide; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Piccoli, Luca",,,404

The main lecture and one clinical elective course were offered digitally in the summer term 2020. Digital methods: In the main lecture, an adapted inverted-classroom concept was used. Podcasts and audio annotated videos were provided. Teaching materials were reflected via a weekly, 1hr video consultation and in a forum. An asynchronous learning module was developed for the elective course ""Smart Decision-making in Clinical Practice"". Each module consisted of course preparation, podcasts and follow-ups as well as a supervised forum. Results: The main lecture (response rate n=115/170; 67.6%) was rated ""very good"" on average. The same applies to the commented videos. The forum, reflective video consultation and teaching materials were rated ""good"" on average. The predominantly desired forms of presence were ""Focus on virtual with in-depth presence phases"" (n=54) and ""Focus on presence phases, virtual support only"" (n=37). Discussion and implications: The digital restructuring enables students to work on the course contents independently.

249377,The impact of teaching culture online during COVID-19,2021,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), is one of the most infectious diseases which reshaped our everyday lives globally in the 21st century. Technology progressions have a rapid effect on every field of life, be it the medical domain or any other. More than 250 countries have been affected by COVID in no matter of time. The Indian government is making the necessary steps to control the spread of virus in the society. People all over the world are vulnerable to its consequences in the future. In a pandemic like this, people often worry whether they show a symptom of COVID-19 or not. Various AI methods have been applied successfully in epidemic studies. This paper presents the prediction and analysis of COVID-19 using various machine learning algorithms. In the present study, ML-based enhanced model is implemented to predict the possible threat of COVID-19 all over the world and the algorithms used in these models classifies the COVID patients based on several subsets of features and predicts their likeliness to get affected to this disease. This model uses 20 metrics including the patient's geographical location, travel history, health record statistics, etc., to predict the severity of the case and the feasible outcome. This research finds the patients exposed to Covid-19 and could be used as a reference, by the patients before consulting further with the doctor. The model developed using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is effective with a prediction accuracy of 98.34%, Recall of 97% and an F1-Score of 0.97.

250156,Social Work during the COVID-19 Crisis: Responding to Urgent Social Needs,2020,"OVID-19 is a world-wide disease that has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Computer Tomography (CT) imaging of the chest seems to be a valid diagnosis tool to detect COVID-19 promptly and to control the spread of the disease. Deep Learning has been extensively used in medical imaging and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been also used for classification of CT images. We propose a light CNN design based on the model of the SqueezeNet, for the efficient discrimination of COVID-19 CT images with other CT images (community-acquired pneumonia and/or healthy images). On the tested datasets, the proposed modified SqueezeNet CNN achieved 83.00\% of accuracy, 85.00\% of sensitivity, 81.00\% of specificity, 81.73\% of precision and 0.8333 of F1Score in a very efficient way (7.81 seconds medium-end laptot without GPU acceleration). Besides performance, the average classification time is very competitive with respect to more complex CNN designs, thus allowing its usability also on medium power computers. In the next future we aim at improving the performances of the method along two directions: 1) by increasing the training dataset (as soon as other CT images will be available); 2) by introducing an efficient pre-processing strategy.","Polsinelli, Matteo; Cinque, Luigi; Placidi, Giuseppe",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12837v1.pdf,404

252431,"Perniosis del confinamiento, una vieja conocida en el contexto del COVID-19./ [Chilblains in lockdown: An old acquaintance in the context of COVID-19]",2020,"BACKGROUND: Increased inflammation has been well defined in COVID-19, while definitive pathways driving severe forms of this disease remain uncertain. Neutrophils are known to contribute to immunopathology in infections, inflammatory diseases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Changes in neutrophil function in COVID-19 may give insight into disease pathogenesis and identify therapeutic targets. METHODS: Blood was obtained serially from critically ill COVID-19 patients for eleven days. Neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis), oxidative burst, phagocytosis and cytokine levels were assessed. Lung tissue was obtained immediately post-mortem for immunostaining. Pubmed searches for neutrophils, lung and COVID-19 yielded ten peer-reviewed research articles in English. RESULTS: Elevations in neutrophil-associated cytokines IL-8 and IL-6, and general inflammatory cytokines IP-10, GM-CSF, IL-1b, IL-10 and TNF, were identified both at first measurement and across hospitalization (p<0.0001). COVID neutrophils had exaggerated oxidative burst (p<0.0001), NETosis (p<0.0001) and phagocytosis (p<0.0001) relative to controls. Increased NETosis correlated with leukocytosis and neutrophilia, and neutrophils and NETs were identified within airways and alveoli in lung parenchyma of 40% of SARS-CoV-2 infected lungs available for examination (2 out of 5). While elevations in IL-8 and ANC correlated with disease severity, plasma IL-8 levels alone correlated with death. CONCLUSIONS: Literature to date demonstrates compelling evidence of increased neutrophils in the circulation and lungs of COVID-19 patients. importantly, neutrophil quantity and activation correlates with severity of disease. Similarly, our data shows that circulating neutrophils in COVID-19 exhibit an activated phenotype with enhanced NETosis and oxidative burst.","Masso-Silva, Jorge A; Moshensky, Alexander; Lam, Michael T Y; Odish, Mazen; Patel, Arjun; Xu, Le; Hansen, Emily; Trescott, Samantha; Nguyen, Celina; Kim, Roy; Perofsky, Katherine; Perera, Samantha; Ma, Lauren; Pham, Josephine; Rolfsen, Mark; Olay, Jarod; Shin, John; Dan, Jennifer M; Abbott, Robert; Ramirez, Sydney; Alexander, Thomas H; Lin, Grace Y; Fuentes, Ana Lucia; Advani, Ira; Gunge, Deepti; Pretorius, Victor; Malhotra, Atul; Sun, Xin; Duran, Jason; Hepokoski, Mark; Crotty, Shane; Coufal, Nicole G; Meier, Angela; Alexander, Laura E Crotty",Clin. infect. dis,,404

In many low- and middle-income countries, inadequate surveillance and incompleteness of death registration are important barriers. DESIGN: Here, we characterize how large an impact on mortality would have to be to be detectable using the uniquely detailed mortality notification data from the city of Antananarivo, Madagascar, with application to a recent measles outbreak. RESULTS: The weekly mortality rate of children during the 2018-2019 measles outbreak was 161% above the expected value at its peak, and the signal can be detected earlier in children than in the general population. This approach to detecting anomalies from expected baseline mortality allows us to delineate the prevalence of COVID-19 at which excess mortality would be detectable with the existing death notification system in Antananarivo. CONCLUSIONS: Given current age-specific estimates of the COVID-19 fatality ratio and the age structure of the population in Antananarivo, we estimate that as few as 11 deaths per week in the 60-70 years age group (corresponding to an infection rate of approximately 1%) would detectably exceed the baseline. Data from 2020 will undergo necessary processing and quality control in the coming months. Our results provide a baseline for interpreting this information.","Rasambainarivo, Fidisoa; Rasoanomenjanahary, Anjarasoa; Rabarison, Joelinotahiana Hasina; Ramiadantsoa, Tanjona; Ratovoson, Rila; Randremanana, Rindra; Randrianarisoa, Santatriniaina; Rajeev, Malavika; Masquelier, Bruno; Heraud, Jean Michel; Metcalf, C Jessica E; Rice, Benjamin L",Int. j. infect. dis,,404

Una perspectiva desde Perú,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a world-wide pandemic since its onset in December of 2019. Although, a primary respiratory pathogen, over the ensuing period, its extra-pulmonary effects have come to the forefront. The virus, having multi-organ tropism, has been shown to affect a host of other organs beyond the lung, including the pancreas. The data on pancreatic involvement by COVID-19, however, have been limited. Moreover, whether the effects on the pancreas are due to the direct effects of the virus or is just an epi-phenomenon is debatable. The prevalence of pancreatic injury and degree of injury are the other issues that need to be addressed. Pancreatic cancer has a dismal prognosis and the management of the same in the COVID era needs to be tailored assessing the risk-benefit ratio for the same. Additionally, pancreatic surgery increases not only the morbidity of the patient, but also the risk of the operator and burden on the health care system. Hence, the decision for such major procedures needs to be rationalized for optimum benefit during this pandemic. Similarly, for the endoscopist, pancreatic endoscopy needs to be carefully regulated to reduce risk to both the patient and the physician and yet deliver optimum patient care. This review gives a concise summary of various aspects of pancreatic involvement and pancreatic disease management during this pandemic.","Samanta, Jayanta; Gupta, Rohit; Singh, Mini P; Patnaik, Itish; Kumar, Ashok; Kochhar, Rakesh",Pancreatology,,404

256961,O raciocínio geográfico e as chaves de leitura da Covid-19 no território brasileiro,2020,"BACKGROUND: To accurately interpret COVID-19 seroprevalence surveys, knowledge of serum-IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 with a better understanding of patients who do not seroconvert, is imperative. This study aimed to describe serum-IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of patients with both severe and mild COVID-19, including extended studies of patients who remained seronegative more than 90 days post symptom onset. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody levels were quantified using two clinically validated and widely used commercial serological assays (Architect, Abbott Laboratories and iFlash 1800, YHLO), detecting antibodies against the spike and nucleocapsid proteins. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (mean age 49 years, 38% female) were included. All (15/15) patients with severe symptoms and 29/32 (90.6%) patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in serum. Time to seroconversion was significantly shorter (median 11 vs. 22 days, P = 0.04) in patients with severe compared to mild symptoms. Of the three patients without detectable IgG-responses after >90 days, all had detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies and in two, spike-protein receptor binding domain-specific IgG was detected with an in-house assay. Antibody titers were preserved during follow-up and all patients who seroconverted, irrespective of the severity of symptoms, still had detectable IgG levels >75 days post symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe COVID-19 both seroconvert earlier and develop higher concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG than patients with mild symptoms. Of those patients who not develop detectable IgG antibodies, all have detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies, suggesting immunity. Our results showing that not all COVID-19 patients develop detectable IgG using two validated commercial clinical methods, even over time, are vital for the interpretation of COVID-19 seroprevalence surveys.","Marklund, Emelie; Leach, Susannah; Axelsson, Hannes; Nyström, Kristina; Norder, Heléne; Bemark, Mats; Angeletti, Davide; Lundgren, Anna; Nilsson, Staffan; Andersson, Lars-Magnus; Yilmaz, Aylin; Lindh, Magnus; Liljeqvist, Jan-Åke; Gisslén, Magnus",PLoS One,,404

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This observational, descriptive, medical records review study was performed on patients with MIS-C admitted to the PICU between September 1 and November 1, 2020. Through medical records review, we confirmed that patients were positive for current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection or for COVID-19 exposure history within the 4 weeks before the onset of symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 33 patients with severe MIS-C were included (21 male) with a median age of 9 years. The most common signs and symptoms during disease course were fever (100%) and abdominal pain (75.5%). Clinical features of 63.6% patients were consistent with Kawasaki disease/Kawasaki disease shock syndrome, and 36.4% were consistent with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome. Myocardial dysfunction and/or coronary artery abnormalities were detected in 18 patients during the PICU stay. Intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids were given to 33 patients. Anakinra was administered to 23 patients (69.6%). There was a significant increase in lymphocyte and platelet counts and a significant decrease in ferritin, B-type natriuretic peptide, and troponin levels at the end of the first week of treatment in patients who were given biological therapy. Two patients were switched to tocilizumab because of an insufficient response to anakinra. The mortality rate of MIS-C patients admitted in PICU was 6.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Management of systemic inflammation and shock is important to decrease mortality and the development of persistent cardiac dysfunction in MIS-C. The aggressive treatment approach, including biological agents, may be required in patients with severe symptoms and cardiac dysfunction.","Çelikel, Elif; Tekin, Zahide Ekici; Aydin, Fatma; Emeksiz, Serhat; Uyar, Emel; Özcan, Serhan; Perk, Oktay; Sezer, Müge; Tekgöz, Nilüfer; Coskun, Serkan; Güngörer, Vildan; Gül, Ayse Esin Kibar; Bayhan, Gülsüm Iclal; Özbek, Namik; Azili, Müjdem Nur; Acar, Banu Çelikel",J. clin. rheumatol,,404

In this study, we explored the associations between admission fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 28-day mortality in COVID-19 patients. In this single centre retrospective study, 263 adult patients with COVID-19 were included. Demographic and clinical information were collected and compared between patients with and without diabetes. Cox regression analyses were used to investigate the risk factors of 28-day mortality in hospitals. Of 263 patients, 161 (61.2%) were male, 62 (25.6%) had a known history of diabetes, and 135 (51.3%) experienced elevated FPG (>7.0 mmol/L) at hospital admission. The median FPG in patients with diabetes was much higher than in patients without diabetes (12.79 vs. 6.47 mmol/L). Patients with diabetes had higher neutrophil count and D-dimer, less lymphocyte count, lower albumin level, and more fatal complications. Multivariable Cox regression analyses showed that age (per 10-year increase) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.74), admission FPG between 7.0 and 11.0 and &#8805;11.1 mmol/L (HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.11-3.25 and HR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.21-3.64, respectively), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.31-6.39), and cardiac injury (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.33-3.47) were independent predictors of 28-day mortality in COVID-19 patients.

Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the viral spike protein, and affinity ligands to this surface protein have the potential for applications as antivirals and diagnostic reagents. Here, we describe the affinity selection of cyclic peptide ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) from three distinct libraries (in excess of a trillion molecules each) by mRNA display. We identified six high affinity molecules with dissociation constants (KD) in the nanomolar range (15-550 nM) to the RBD. The highest affinity ligand could be used as an affinity reagent to detect the spike protein in solution by ELISA, and the cocrystal structure of this molecule bound to the RBD demonstrated that it binds to a cryptic binding site, displacing a β-strand near the C-terminus. Our findings provide key mechanistic insight into the binding of peptide ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, and the ligands discovered in this work may find future use as reagents for diagnostic applications. © 2021 The Authors.

260720,Applying Gerontological Social Work Perspectives to the Coronavirus Pandemic,2020,"Corona viruses are spherical nanoparticles with peripheral spike protein and diameters around 60 to 140 nm. In contrast to the elder versions, COVID-19 spread vastly and quickly all over the world. World Health Organization (WHO) insists on adequate social distancing in order to decrease the risk of contagion by air. In the present work, different parameters which affect the necessary social distance were investigated. Drag coefficient around a Corona-shaped nanoparticle with the geometry of COVID-19 was determined by modeling laminar flow in different Reynolds numbers. Accordingly, modified correlations for drag coefficient were derived which implied to be much higher in Corona-shaped particles in compare to spherical ones. Applying the new modified correlation, the behavior of 120 nm to 120 mu m droplets generated by sneezing or coughing were investigated considering the evaporation of the volatile portion of the virus (around 94%), in different ambient conditions, namely temperature, pressure and relative humidity. Studying COVID-19 falling behavior showed that terminal velocity in Corona-shaped particles was much lower than spherical particles of the same size. It was also proved that falling time in Corona-shaped particles was longer, i.e. lasted longer in air. Ambient temperature increase and decrease in ambient relative humidity resulted into decrease in falling speed of the Corona particles. Decrease in ambient pressure, i.e. increase in elevation from sea level, yielded an increase in molecular free mean path which consequently resulted into reduction in falling speed. Hot dry areas were recognized to be critical from the viewpoint of COVID-19 spread through air.","Javadi, M.",Eurasian Chemical Communications,,404

The lack of specific antiviral medicines and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines continues to aggravate the situation. Natural product-based antiviral drugs have been used in the two previous CoV outbreaks: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the first SARS-CoV. This review emphasizes the role of natural and semisynthetic candidate molecules for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prophylaxis and treatment. The experimental evidence suggests that nature could offer huge possibilities for treatment of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bita, Andrei; Scorei, Ion Romulus; Mogoanta, Laurentiu; Bejenaru, Cornelia; Mogosanu, George Dan; Bejenaru, Ludovic Everard",Rom J Morphol Embryol,,404

Although discussions have centered on policies to promote financial liquidity, we examine whether the state apparatus-not only state-owned enterprises but also development agencies and investment funds-can innovate and adjust production processes to improve infrastructure and capabilities to prevent and treat the disease. Potential actions include public-private effort addressing both discovery and coordination problems-such as a collaborative effort to develop prevention and treatment technologies, as well as state capital to stimulate retooling and expansion of strategic infrastructure. The state apparatus can also help access remote and critical areas with relatively lower private returns. In contrast, support to industries must be implemented with caution, especially for sectors whose demand may suffer permanently due to lifestyle changes. Exit strategies must be carefully crafted to avoid the risk of perpetuating unjustified and ineffective state support, establishing milestones and termination clauses based on clear performance indicators. We argue that, although using the state apparatus as a countermeasure entails a set of risks, not using it may increase the risk of extending the crisis and end with an overloaded state sector (e.g., due to massive bailouts), challenging the implementation of subsequent adjustments.","Lazzarini, Sérgio Giovanetti; Musacchio, Aldo",Rev. adm. pública (Online),,404

264110,"Risk factors associated with delay in diagnosis and mortality in patients with COVID-19 in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic likely exacerbated caregiving challenges for caregivers of parents diagnosed with a blood cancer. Providing care during a public health crisis presents a complex web of uncertainties regarding cancer care, personal health, and COVID-19 risk. Identifying caregivers' uncertainty experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic can be a first step in learning where to direct resources or alter policies to ensure that they can not only perform their caregiver role but also cope in health-promoting ways. Using uncertainty management theory, this study explored how the pandemic has impacted adult child caregivers' experiences caring for a parent diagnosed with a blood cancer, as well as their experiences of uncertainty and uncertainty management. As part of a larger study on blood cancer caregivers' needs, a survey was administered from March 30 to June 1, 2020, to recruit caregivers through the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. A qualitative and quantitative content analysis was conducted on open-ended responses from 84 caregivers. Caregivers described changes illustrating the complexity of providing care during a pandemic: (a) increased fears and uncertainty-related distress, b) reduced in-person care opportunities, (c) increased isolation, and (d) enhanced family communication. Caregivers with parents diagnosed with acute blood cancers used significantly more uncertainty management strategies and had more sources of uncertainty than caregivers with parents living with chronic blood cancer types. Findings highlight the need for supportive services to help caregivers manage uncertainty and improve their capacity to provide care in an unpredictable global health crisis. Such support may reduce poor psychosocial outcomes.","Fisher, Carla L; Wright, Kevin B; Hampton, Chelsea N; Vasquez, Taylor S; Kastrinos, Amanda; Applebaum, Allison J; Sae-Hau, Maria; Weiss, Elisa S; Lincoln, Greg; Bylund, Carma L",Transl Behav Med,,404

This pandemic represents a great work risk for all health professionals, it includes dental professionals who are in constant contact with saliva, which represents one of the main routes of transmission of the disease. This is due to the fact that a wide variety of oral tissues and cells are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and that they express the ACE2 receptor, which is the main route of entry of the virus into cells, as well as the proteins TMPRSS and furin that contributes to the binding of the virus to the host cells. According to recent studies, some of the oral cells most susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 are the epithelial cells of the salivary glands. This explains the presence of the virus in the saliva of infected patients and provides scientific evidence that supports the use of saliva as a biofluid that offers the opportunity to develop new detection and diagnostic techniques. This is because saliva is much easier to collect compared to nasopharyngeal swab. However, the presence of the virus in saliva, also represents a great source of transmission, since the main form of infection is through microscopic drops that are generated when infected people cough or sneeze. Likewise, health professionals, such as dentists are exposed to contagion through saliva. The objective of this review article is to provide a perspective on the main cells and tissues that can be affected by the virus, the risk of contagion that the presence of the virus in saliva represents for dentists;and the new techniques developed from saliva samples for the diagnosis and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review is expected to contribute to the knowledge of oral health professionals about the risk of saliva in the spread of SARS-CoV-2, but also its advantages as a diagnostic tool for pandemic control. In conclusion, the authors can mention that information that provides more scientific evidence of the mechanisms of infection of the coronavirus in oral cells and tissues is being published continually. This also explains the presence of the virus in the saliva of infected people and the risk of contagion that this means. It also provides scientific evidence of the use of saliva as a biofluid for the detection, diagnosis, monitoring, and control of the spread of the virus.","Casillas Santana, M. A.; Dipp Velazquez, F.

267981,More eyes on COVID-19: Perspectives from Religion Studies How Christian theology helps us make sense of the pandemic,2020,"Coronaviruses and influenza viruses are circulating in humans and animals all over the world. Co-infection with these two viruses may aggravate clinical signs. However, the molecular mechanisms of co-infections by these two viruses are incompletely understood. In this study, we applied air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures of well-differentiated porcine tracheal epithelial cells (PTECs) to analyze the co-infection by a swine influenza virus (SIV, H3N2 subtype) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV) at different time intervals. Our results revealed that in short-term intervals, prior infection by influenza virus caused complete inhibition of coronavirus infection, while in long-term intervals, some coronavirus replication was detectable. The influenza virus infection resulted in (i) an upregulation of porcine aminopeptidase N, the cellular receptor for PRCoV and (ii) in the induction of an innate immune response which was responsible for the inhibition of PRCoV replication. By contrast, prior infection by coronavirus only caused a slight inhibition of influenza virus replication. Taken together, the timing and the order of virus infection are important determinants in co-infections. This study is the first to show the impact of SIV and PRCoV co- and super-infection on the cellular level. Our results have implications also for human viruses, including potential co-infections by SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal influenza viruses.","Peng, Ju-Yi; Shin, Dai-Lun; Li, Guangxing; Wu, Nai-Huei; Herrler, Georg",Virulence,,404

As an arena that has historically been relatively insulated from national partisan cleavages, public schools provide a useful window into understanding the growing nationalization of local politics. Leveraging the fact that all school districts had to adopt a reopening plan in fall 2020, we assess the factors that influenced school district reopening decisions. We find that mass partisanship and vested interests best explain the degree to which schools reopened. Republican (Democratic) districts were far more (less) likely to reopen in person, while districts with stronger unions relied more on remote learning. Notably, we find little connection between reopening decisions and indicators measuring the severity of the virus. Finally, public schools were sensitive to the threat of student exit. Districts located in counties with more Catholic schools were somewhat more likely to reopen in person. We assess the implications of these findings for U.S. education policy and the study of local government more generally. © The Author(s), 2021.

Nonetheless, acute abdominal surgical emergencies are major causes for nontrauma-related hospital admissions and their incidences were expected to remain unchanged. Surprisingly, a significant decrease in volume and a higher proportion of complicated cases are being observed worldwide. METHODS: The present study assesses the local impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the emergency presentation of acute appendicitis in a Brazilian hospital. A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients undergoing emergency surgery for the clinically suspected diagnosis of acute appendicitis during the 2-month period of March and April 2020 and the same time interval in the previous year. Data on demographics, timing of symptom onset and hospital presentation, intraoperative details, postoperative complications, hospital length of stay, and histological examination of the specimen were retrieved from individual registries. RESULTS: The number of appendectomies during the pandemic was 36, which represents a 56% reduction compared to the 82 patients operated during the same period in 2019. The average time of symptom onset to hospital arrival was significantly higher in 2020 (40.6 vs. 28.2 hours, P = .02). The classification of appendicitis revealed a significant higher proportion of complicated cases than the previous year (33.3% vs. 15.2%, P = .04). The rate of postoperative complications and the average length of stay were not statistically different between the groups. CONCLUSION: Further assessment of patients' concerns and systematic monitoring of emergency presentations are expected to help us understand and adequately address this issue.","Kumaira Fonseca, Mariana; Trindade, Eduardo N; Costa Filho, Omero P; Nácul, Miguel P; Seabra, Artur P",Am Surg,,404

Design/methodology/approach: In this essay, I discuss some general observations about education during the pandemic and then provide a perspective to some issues related to educational inequalities and learning from home during the pandemic. The essay is informed by recent media articles and reports of national and international institutions. Findings: This essay makes three claims: Despite high hopes, there is only a little chance schools will change as a consequence of this pandemic without bold and brave shifts in mindset in how that change happens. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the effects of preexisting social and educational inequalities; fixing these would be an important consequence of the pandemic. During school closures, learning from home has been mostly based on the old logic of consuming information and knowledge rather than creating or cocreating new ideas and solutions to real-life problems. Research limitations/implications: This is an essay that offers evidence-informed perspectives to current development in education, and it should not be treated as a research-based article. Originality/value: This essay will contribute to the evolving public conversation and professional debate on the future of school education. It will be part of the series of essays that will support those who are seeking to not just adapt to meet the pandemic but also to step back and consider the medium to longer-term implications.","Sahlberg, Pasi",J.

The results of X-ray diffraction, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analyses, and scanning electron microscopy indicated that ß-CD excluded from the polymer chains and aggregated to form crystals during film formation, which drove HCS to interact with KGM more compactly. The thickness and transparency of the films increased after ß-CD was incorporated. More associations of HCS/KGM enhanced the mechanical properties and reduced the moisture content of the films. The water vapor permeability of the HCS/KGM composite film was also improved significantly with the incorporation of ß-CD. The enhanced association between biopolymers in the presence of ß-CD will advance the development of a degradable active composite packaging film.","Zou, Yiyuan; Yuan, Chao; Cui, Bo; Sha, Haojie; Liu, Pengfei; Lu, Lu; Wu, Zhengzong",J. agric.

The current mechanism of electrocatalysis of methanol oxidation on platinum and non-platinum-containing alloys is summarized for the systematic improvement of the rate of electro-oxidation of methanol are discussed. Policy realignment under the five-year plan is discussed in length to demonstrate how policy, markets, and engineering designs contribute towards the development of model direct methanol fuel cells operational enhancement, and factors that affect critical performance parameters for commercial exploitation are summarized for catalytic formulations and cell design within the context of why this investment in technology, education, and finances is required within the global context of sustainable energy and energy independence as exposed by thirteenth the five-year plan. The prolog focuses on the way, whereas the section on methanol fuel cells on the how and the post log on what is expected post-COVID-19 era in science and technology as China pivots to a post-fossil fuel economy. China's industrial growth has been through internal market reforms and supplies side economics from the Chinese markets for fossil fuels except for petroleum. The latest renewable portfolio standards adopted have common elements as adopted from North American and the United Kingdom in terms of adaptation of obligation in terms of renewable portfolio standards as well as a realization that the necessity for renewables standards for the thirteen five year plan (from 2016 to 2020) need to less rigorously implemented due to performance targets that were met during the eleventh (06-10) and twelfth five-year plans (11-15) in terms of utilization of small coal-ire power plants, development of newer standards, led to an improvement of energy efficiency of 15 %, reduction of SOx/NOx by an average of 90 % and PM2.5 by 96 % over the last two five-year plans. The current phase of the plan has a focus on energy generation from coal and a slowing down of renewables or Renewable energy curtailment of approximately 400 T Wh renewables including 300 T Wh of non-hydro power, principally from Guangdong, and Jiangsu for transfer of hydropower and Zhejiang, Tianjin, Henan for non-hydro power transfer with Beijing and Shanghai playing important roles in renewables energy curtailment and realignment using an integrated approach to optimize each provinces energy portfolio. The realignment of the renewable energy portfolio indicates that the newly installed capacity in Sichuan, Yunnan, Inner Mongolia, and Zhejiang will account for less than 20 % of the current renewable energy portfolio but with the NOx SOx and PM2.5 savings already accrued. The catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide to methanol (70 / 110 million metric tons from all sources in 2019 for China/world) is one technological approach to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions and suggests that catalytic methanol synthesis by CO2 hydrogenation may be a plausible approach, even if it is more expensive economically than methanol synthesis by the syngas approach. This is because the CO2 emissions of the synthesis are lower than other synthesis methodologies. The Chinese government has placed a premium on cleaner air and water and may view such an approach as solving the dual issues of fuel substitution and reduction of CO2. Thus, the coupling of hydrogen generation from sustainable energies sources (Solar 175 / 509 GW) or wind (211/591.5 GW in 2019) may be an attractive approach, as this requires slightly less water than coal gasification. Due to the thermodynamic requirement of lower operating pressure and higher operating pressure, currently, there is no single operational approach, although some practice approaches (220 °C at 48 atm using copper) and zinc oxide/alumina are suggested for optimal performance.","Yongjun, Gao; Liu, Jingbo; Bashir, Sajid",Catalysis today,,404

Telepharmacy,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, produced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly throughout the world. Latin American and the Caribbean countries have been harshly affected by the pandemic mainly due to less prepared healthcare systems and fragmented social safety nets. In the region, health status population-based indicators are worse than compared to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Recent evidence suggests that the progression and severity of COVID-19 are associated with the prior health status of individuals, and studies have shown that the case fatality rate is highly stratified among different populations. This narrative review aims to describe factors associated with adverse outcomes of COVID-19 in the context of social determinants of health in Latin American and Caribbean countries. In this review, we state that genetic and biological factors interact in a sophisticated way with social determinants of health, impacting the rapid spread of COVID-19 in Latin American and Caribbean countries. Behavioral factors, such as physical inactivity, smoking, and unhealthy diets, are related to chronic systemic inflammation. Also, air pollution can prolong inflammation and the hyper-activation of the immune system. Air pollutants could facilitate the spread of the virus. Finally, frailty and comorbidities can be associated with COVID-19 severity through increasing vulnerability to stressors and leading to more severe symptoms of COVID-19 disease, including a higher mortality risk. All these factors contribute to increasing the impact of COVID-19 in Latin American and Caribbean countries. We highlight the relevance of considering social determinants of health in Latin American and the Caribbean countries, not only in controlling the likelihood of getting the disease but also its progression and severity. All these social determinants can guide the design and implementation of tailored interventions promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors, which should lower the spread of the disease, its severity, and lethality.","Balboa-Castillo, Teresa; Andrade-Mayorga, Omar; Marzuca-Nassr, Gabriel Nasri; Morales Illanes, Gladys; Ortiz, Manuel; Schiferlli, Ingrid; Aguilar-Farias, Nicolas; Soto, Álvaro; Sapunar, Jorge",Medwave,,404

Telepharmacy,2020,"The pandemic period has generated major problems in the pharmacies of hospitals and local health care companies regarding the distribution of drugs to patients undergoing treatment with chronic drugs. This is because the patient, during the lockdown, was forced to leave the house and go several miles away to reach the place where the drug was dispensed. Moreover, very often, the place was placed in covid-19 hospitals, like the one in Perugia, and was also a risk for the patient himself. The logistical organization allows, in addition to the advantages of traceability, efficiency and savings, with the arrival of the drug at home, a very high patient compliance that also translates into greater security in a pandemic period. To the Usl Umbria 1 of Perugia (Italy) has been centralized the activity of warehouse for all the South area that includes three hospitals and four sanitary districts. Such warehouse, through computerized procedure, guarantees the direct distribution with sending of the medicines directly to the district of belonging of the patient. In this way the patient was not forced to make long and risky trips to continue their chronic therapies. Moreover, this logistic warehouse has also allowed to cope with the correct management of many medicinal specialties that have been used against the SARS-CoV-2 virus avoiding their temporary deficiency for patients already on therapy according to the normal therapeutic indications (anti-inflammatory, antiretroviral and immunomodulatory). This paper aims to demonstrate how logistical organization is of vital importance for a National Health System that has to face increasing costs, ensure the traceability of all processes and, last but not least, survive a worldwide pandemic period.","Ferrara, Francesco; Santilli, Priscilla; Bartolini, Lavinia; Vitiello, Antonio; Pennacchia, Andrea; Di Croce, Silvia; D039,; Aiuto, Vilma",Recenti Prog Med,,404

The C5a complement factor and its receptor C5aR1 (also known as CD88) have a key role in the initiation and maintenance of several inflammatory responses by recruiting and activating neutrophils and monocytes1. Here we provide a longitudinal analysis of immune responses, including phenotypic analyses of immune cells and assessments of the soluble factors that are present in the blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients at various stages of COVID-19 severity, including those who were paucisymptomatic or had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome. The levels of soluble C5a were increased in proportion to the severity of COVID-19 and high expression levels of C5aR1 receptors were found in blood and pulmonary myeloid cells, which supports a role for the C5a-C5aR1 axis in the pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Anti-C5aR1 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies prevented the C5a-mediated recruitment and activation of human myeloid cells, and inhibited acute lung injury in human C5aR1 knock-in mice. These results suggest that blockade of the C5a-C5aR1 axis could be used to limit the infiltration of myeloid cells in damaged organs and prevent the excessive lung inflammation and endothelialitis that are associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19.","Carvelli, Julien; Demaria, Olivier; Vély, Frédéric; Batista, Luciana; Chouaki Benmansour, Nassima; Fares, Joanna; Carpentier, Sabrina; Thibult, Marie-Laure; Morel, Ariane; Remark, Romain; André, Pascale; Represa, Agnès; Piperoglou, Christelle; Cordier, Pierre Yves; Le Dault, Erwan; Guervilly, Christophe; Simeone, Pierre; Gainnier, Marc; Morel, Yannis; Ebbo, Mikael; Schleinitz, Nicolas; Vivier, Eric",Nature (Lond.),,404

We explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cardiac operations and interventions undertaken in England. METHODS AND RESULTS : An administrative database covering hospital activity for England, the Health Episodes Statistics, was used to assess a total of 286 697 hospitalizations for cardiac operations and interventions, as well as 227 257 hospitalizations for myocardial infarction (MI) and 453 799 for heart failure (HF) from 7 January 2019 to 26 July 2020. Over the 3 months of 'lockdown', total numbers and mean reductions in weekly rates [n (-%)], compared with the same time period in 2019, were: coronary artery bypass grafting [-2507 (-64%)]; percutaneous coronary intervention [-5245 (-28%)]; surgical [-1324 (-41%)] and transcatheter [-284 (-21%)] aortic valve replacement; mitral valve replacement; implantation of pacemakers [-6450 (-44%)], cardiac resynchronization therapy with [-356 (-42%)] or without [-491 (-46%)] defibrillation devices, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators [-501 (-45%)]; atrial fibrillation ablation [-1902 (-83%)], and other ablations [-1712 (-64%)] (all P < 0.001). Over this period, there were 21 038 fewer procedures than in the reference period in 2019 (P < 0.001).

Although open surgical repair has been the standard approach to peripheral vascular injuries, endovascular treatment has become more refined and is now an alternative to open surgery, which potentially involves lower morbidity and mortality rates. However, management of arterial injuries, especially when they involve simple bleeding from small branches of the main artery, can be challenging, and the best treatment options for such injuries remains controversial. PATIENT CONCERNS: Three cases suffered blunt trauma that resulted in hemorrhage from branches of the SFA. DIAGNOSIS: All patients underwent selective angiography, which demonstrated active extravasation from branches of the SFA. INTERVENTIONS: All patients were treated using embolization with n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA). OUTCOMES: A post-embolization angiography demonstrated successful hemostasis, with no complications. CONCLUSION: Superselective catheterization using a coaxial technique with a 5-F curved catheter and the smallest caliber microcatheter, and using a permanent liquid embolic agent, such as NBCA, increases the success rate of embolization for cases of hemorrhage from SFA branches.","Oh, Chang Hoon; Kim, Yook; Lee, Jung Hwan; Kim, Hong Rye; Go, Seung Je",Medicine (Baltimore),,404

Hence, targeting the viral entry mechanisms remains a major strategy for COVID-19 treatment. Although recent efforts have focused on the direct inhibition of S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) interactions with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), allosteric targeting remains an unexplored possibility. Therefore, in this study, for the first time, we employed an integrative meta-analytical approach to investigate the allosteric inhibitory mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and its association with hACE2. Findings revealed two druggable sites (Sites 1 and 2) located at the N-terminal domain (NTD) and S2 regions of the protein. Two high-affinity binders; ZINC3939013 (Fosaprepitant - Site 1) and ZINC27990463 (Lomitapide - Site 2) were discovered via site-directed high-throughput screening against a library of â¼1500 FDA approved drugs. Interestingly, we observed that allosteric binding of both compounds perturbed the prefusion S-protein conformations, which in turn, resulted in unprecedented hACE2 displacement from the RBD. Estimated &#916;G binds for both compounds were highly favorable due to high-affinity interactions at the target sites. In addition, Site 1 residues; R190, H207, K206 and K187, I101, R102, I119, F192, L226, V126 and W104 were identified for their crucial involvement in the binding and stability of ZINC3939013. Likewise, energy contributions of Q957, N953, Q954, L303, Y313, Q314, L858, V952, N953, and A956 corroborated their importance to ZINC27990463 binding at the predicted Site 2.

Female BALB/cJ mice were infected with 6,000 PFU of MHV-A59 (group infected, n = 20) or infected and then immediately treated with a single dose of 500 µg/kg ivermectin (group infected + IVM, n = 20) or were not infected and treated with PBS (control group, n = 16). Five days after infection/treatment, the mice were euthanized and the tissues were sampled to assess their general health status and infection levels. Overall, the results demonstrated that viral infection induced typical MHV-caused disease, with the livers showing severe hepatocellular necrosis surrounded by a severe lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltration associated with a high hepatic viral load (52,158 AU), while mice treated with ivermectin showed a better health status with a lower viral load (23,192 AU; p < 0.05), with only a few having histopathological liver damage (p < 0.05). No significant differences were found between the group infected + IVM and control group mice (P = NS). Furthermore, serum transaminase levels (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) were significantly lower in the treated mice than in the infected animals. In conclusion, ivermectin diminished the MHV viral load and disease in the mice, being a useful model for further understanding this therapy against coronavirus diseases.","Arévalo, A P; Pagotto, R; Pórfido, J L; Daghero, H; Segovia, M; Yamasaki, K; Varela, B; Hill, M; Verdes, J M; Duhalde Vega, M; Bollati-Fogolín, M; Crispo, M",Sci Rep,,404

Severe thrombocytopenia is less common and is associated with severe forms of COVID-19. The pathogenesis of this thrombocytopenia appears to be complex, the immune mechanism being incriminated. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is one of the severe complications of COVID-19 and has an increased risk of mucosal or cutaneous bleeding. Case report We present the case of a 72-year-old woman admitted to the hospital with moderate COVID-19 who developed severe thrombocytopenia 13 days after the onset of COVID symptoms. Nine days after admission, her platelets decreased from 149X109/L to 3X109/L and numerous patches appeared on the skin and mucous membranes. She was responsive to corticosteroids and platelet transfusion, after five days, the platelet level returned to normal. Conclusions Close hematological monitoring of patients with COVID is necessary to prevent severe complications. Even if this patient did not receive immunoglobulins, corticosteroid therapy and platelet administration led to a favorable outcome.","Petcu, Andra Elena Dumitru Irina Magdalena Cernat Roxana Carmen Şerhan Carmen Ilie Hangan Aurelia Ghita Elena Vlad Nicoleta Dorina Dumitrascu Mirela Câmpeanu Adriana Teodora Rugină Sorin",Germs,,404

286172,Changes in the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) of University Schools of Medicine during COVID-19. Experience with a computer-based case simulation OSCE (CCS-OSCE),2021,"Abstract SARS-CoV-2 has high human-human transmission rate. The aerosols and saliva droplets are the main contamination source. Thus, it is crucial to point out that dental practitioners become a high-risk group of contagion by SARS-CoV-2. Based on this, protocols have been recommended to avoid cross-contamination during dental care; however, appropriate evidence has not yet been established. Objective Our study sought to make a screening, by in silico analysis, of the potential of mouth rinses used in dental practices to prevent the dental workers' contamination by SARS-CoV-2. Methodology Multiple sequence comparisons and construction of the phylogenetic tree were conducted using the FASTA code. Therefore, molecular docking investigation between SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Main Protease, Spike Glycoprotein, Non-structure Protein, and Papain-like Protease) and molecules used in dental practices (chlorhexidine digluconate, hydrogen peroxide, cetylpyridinium chloride, povidone-iodine, gallic acid, &#946;-cyclodextrin, catechin, and quercetin) was performed using AutoDock Vina. Moreover, 2D interactions of the complex protein-ligand structure were analyzed by Ligplot+. Results The obtained results showed a remarkable affinity between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and all tested compounds. The chlorhexidine digluconate, catechin, and quercetin presented a higher affinity with SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions The overall results allowed us to suggest that chlorhexidine is the most suitable active compound in reducing the SARS-CoV-2 salivary load due to its better binding energy. However, in vivo studies should be conducted to confirm their clinical use.","SETTE-DE-SOUZA, Pedro Henrique; COSTA, Moan Jéfter Fernandes; AMARAL-MACHADO, Lucas; ARAÚJO, Fábio Andrey da Costa; ALMEIDA FILHO, Adauto Trigueiro; LIMA, Luiza Rayanna Amorim de",J. appl. oral sci,,404

288774,Forced Disruption of Anatomy Education in Australia and New Zealand: An Acute Response to the Covid-19 Pandemic,2020,"Background: Conflicts pose new challenges for health systems, requiring rapid and practical approaches to meet emerging needs on the ground. Lebanon has been highly influenced by surrounding conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, especially the Syrian crisis. Strengthening research capacity to collect evidence on conflict in the MENA region and beyond is crucial to inform healthcare policy and practice. For targeted capacity strengthening interventions, the main objective of this paper is to present key findings of a needs assessment of conflict and health research in Lebanon. This will support recent efforts to scale up context-specific policies, interventions to strengthen the country's health system, and research capacity. Methods: The study is based on 30 semi-structured interviews with key informants such as specialist academics, humanitarian workers and public sector officials. Results: Despite being ranked third in the number of publications on biomedical and health research per capita in MENA and in hosting reputable universities which are considered central academic hubs in the region, lack of nationwide research culture, insufficient funding and limited access to data were reported to be major challenges for health researchers in Lebanon. Even with the ongoing efforts, poor impact of research on policy continues to be a persistent gap. Large disparities in research capacities and taught skills were reported between different universities in Lebanon, with a disproportionate emphasis on quantitative over qualitative skills. Most medical students are not trained to conduct research or to practice in conflict settings. Concerns were also expressed regarding the ethics of research conducted, specifically by local non-governmental organizations. Recommendations: To conduct contextualized trainings on research skills with a stronger focus on qualitative approaches, medical practice, and ethical research in conflict. To better involve policymakers in designing research agendas by organizing multiple stakeholder meetings. Conclusion: The study indicates that health research in Lebanon is characterized by considerable strengths in terms of human capital and research capacities of certain universities. However, the Lebanese research infrastructure needs further development in terms of ensuring sustainable funding, providing access to data, teaching qualitative research skills, conducting ethical and multidisciplinary research, and promoting cross-sectoral knowledge transfer.","El Achi, Nassim; Honein-Abouhaidar, Gladys; Rizk, Anthony; Kobeissi, Elsa; Papamichail, Andreas; Meagher, Kristen; Ekzayez, Abdulkarim; Abu-Sittah, Ghassan S; Patel, Preeti",Confl Health,,404

We propose FastGAT, a method to make attention based GNNs lightweight by using spectral sparsification to generate an optimal pruning of the input graph. This results in a per-epoch time that is almost linear in the number of graph nodes as opposed to quadratic. Further, we provide a re-formulation of a specific attention based GNN, Graph Attention Network (GAT) that interprets it as a graph convolution method using the random walk normalized graph Laplacian. Using this framework, we theoretically prove that spectral sparsification preserves the features computed by the GAT model, thereby justifying our FastGAT algorithm. We experimentally evaluate FastGAT on several large real world graph datasets for node classification tasks, FastGAT can dramatically reduce (up to 10x) the computational time and memory requirements, allowing the usage of attention based GNNs on large graphs.","Srinivasa, Rakshith S; Xiao, Cao; Glass, Lucas; Romberg, Justin; Sun, Jimeng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08796v2.pdf,404

CONCLUSION: Bedside blood purification treatment in the COVID-19 isolation ward, the occurrence and spread of healthcare associated infection can be effectively controlled through effective infection prevention and control management, including divisional isolation, patient behavior isolation and patient placement, operator personal protection and hand hygiene, dialysis waste fluid disposal, isolation room's air purification, object surfaces, medical devices and medical fabrics disinfection, which can provide experience for diagnosis, treatment and prevention and control of patients in the respiratory infectious disease ward.","Chen, M L; Gao, Y; Guo, W; Zuo, L; Wang, T B",Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,,404
292401,Paciente anciano y sus complicaciones por infección por COVID-19./ [Geriatric patient with covid-19 infection and common complications],2020,"Background Antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) offer new opportunities for the quick and laboratory-independent identification of infected individuals for control of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Despite the potential benefits, nasopharyngeal sample collection is frequently perceived as uncomfortable by patients and requires trained healthcare personnel with protective equipment. Therefore, anterior nasal self-sampling is increasingly recognized as a valuable alternative. Methods We performed a prospective, single-center, point of care validation of an Ag-RDT using a polypropylene absorbent collector for standardized self-collected anterior nasal swabs. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from combined oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swabs served as a comparator. Primary endpoint was sensitivity of the standardized Ag-RDT in symptomatic patients with medium or high viral concentration (≥1 million RNA copies on RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2). Results Between 12 February and 22 March 2021, 388 participants were enrolled. After exclusion of 9 patients for which no PCR result could be obtained, the novel Ag-RDT was evaluated based on 379 participants, of whom 273 were symptomatic and 106 asymptomatic. In 61 samples from symptomatic patients with medium or high viral load (≥1 million RNA copies), the sensitivity of the standardized Ag-RDT was 96.7% (59/61;95% confidence interval (CI): 88.7–99.6%) for the primary endpoint. In total, 62 positive Ag-RDT results were detected out of 70 RT-PCR positive individuals, yielding an overall sensitivity of 88.6% (95% CI: 78.7–94.9%). Specificity was 99.7% (95% CI: 98.2–100%) in 309 RT-PCR negative individuals. Conclusions Here, we present a validation of a novel Ag-RDT with a standardized sampling process for anterior nasal self-collection, which meets World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria of ≥80% sensitivity and ≥97% specificity. Although less sensitive than RT-PCR, this assay could be beneficial due to its rapid results, ease of use, and suitability for standardized self-testing.","Osmanodja, Bilgin Budde Klemens Zickler Daniel Naik Marcel G.; Hofmann, Jörg Gertler Maximilian Hülso Claudia Rössig Heike Horn Philipp Seybold Joachim Lunow Stephanie Bothmann Melanie Barrera-Pesek Astrid Mayrdorfer Manuel",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,404

At the beginning of the pandemic, all states showed a growing number of cases, first in the capitals and then in the interior. Following this wave, decreases are observed in all states and their capitals, but with many still reporting a large number of cases. In the middle of the 2nd semester of 2020 the number of cases begins to increase again simultaneously in states and their capitals&#8212;some at explosive speed&#8212;especially in late 2020 and early 2021. A similar pattern is observed in deaths, which exceed or approach the peak seen in the first wave. In the first wave, all capitals and northeastern states adopted intense isolation measures. Fortaleza, Recife and Teresina reached the highest isolation index of all capitals, close to 0.60. This index decreases, with a slight growth trend until the end of December. With the exception of Fortaleza and Salvador, the other capitals fell to less than 0.40. CONCLUSION The Brazilian NE and the country are in increasingly complicated health, social and economic situations. It is necessary to speed up vaccinations and maintain non-pharmacological measures: face masks, social distancing measures and hygiene care, in addition to policies to protect workers who have lost their incomes and to subsidize small business owners.","Kerr, Ligia Regina Franco Sansigolo; Kendall, Carl; Almeida, Rosa Lívia Freitas de; Ichihara, Maria Yury; Aquino, Estela Maria L; Silva, Antônio Augusto Moura da; Ximenes, Ricardo Arraes de Alencar; Albuquerque, Maria de Fatima Pessoa Militão de; Almeida-Filho, Naomar; Souza, Rafael Felipe; Brandão Filho, Sinval Pinto; Souza, Wayner Vieira de; Barreto, Maurício Lima",Rev. saúde pública (Online),,404
295362,Coinfeccion entre dengue y COVID-19: Necesidad de abordaje en zonas endemicas,2020,"Objective. Our objective was to analyze the evolution of the information in Spanish online about the prevention of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods. On 1 March and 13 July 2020, two searches were conducted on Google with the terms ""Prevencion COVID-19"" and ""Prevencion Coronavirus"". In each stage, a univariate analysis was performed to study the association of the authorship and country of origin with the basic recommendations to avoid COVID-19 provided by the World Health Organization (WHO). Results. A total of 120 weblinks were evaluated. The recommendation found most frequently in both stages was ""wash your hands frequently"" (93.3% in March vs. 90.0% in July). There was a significant increase in the detection of the following recommendations: ""avoid touching your face"" (56.7% vs. 80.0%) and ""stay at home if you feel unwell"" (28.3% vs. 63.3%). Weblinks of official public health organizations more frequently provided the advice to ""seek medical advice if you develop a fever/cough or have difficulty breathing"". Furthermore, in July, such weblinks provided recommendations to ""avoid touching your face"" and ""maintain a distance of one meter"" more frequently than the mass media (OR = 11.5 and 10.5, respectively). In March, the recommendation to ""maintain a distance of at least 1 m"" was associated with the weblinks from countries with local transmission/imported cases (OR = 8.1). Different/ambiguous information regarding the WHO recommendations was detected in four weblinks. Conclusion. The availability of information in Spanish online on basic prevention measures has improved over time, although there is still room for improvement. It is necessary to promote the use of the websites of official public health organizations among Spanish-speaking users.","Hernández-García, Ignacio; Giménez-Júlvez, Teresa",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,404

In this paper, we predict the epidemic risk of each province based on geographical proximity information, spatial inverse distance information, economic distance and Baidu migration index. A simulation study revealed that the information based on geographical economy matrix and migration index could well predict the spatial spread of the epidemic. The results reveal that the accuracy rate of the prediction is over 87.10% with a rank difference of 3.1. The results based on prior information will guide government agencies and medical and health institutions to implement responses to major public health emergencies when facing the epidemic situation.","Cheng, Xuewei; Han, Zhaozhou; Abba, Badamasi; Wang, Hong",PeerJ,,404

We performed a retrospective multicenter cohort analysis of PLWH with either laboratory-confirmed, radiologically diagnosed, or clinically suspected COVID-19 between February 15, 2020 and May 31, 2020. The primary endpoint was outcome of COVID-19. Secondary endpoints included rate of hospitalization and length of hospital stay and rate of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation. One hundred and one patients were included in this study. Patients were categorized as having either laboratory-confirmed (n = 65), radiologically-diagnosed (n = 3), or clinically suspected COVID-19 (n = 33). The median age was 51.3 years (interquartile range [IQR] 41.3-57.3) and 44% were female. Ninety-four percent of patients were virologically suppressed and 67% had a CD4+ cell count more than or equal to 500 cells/µl. Overall, 46% of patients required hospitalization and the median length of hospital stay was 6 days (IQR 3-15). Age more than or equal to 50 years, Black Sub-Saharan African patients, and being on an integrase strand transfer inhibitor-based regimen were associated with being hospitalized. ICU admission and mechanical ventilation was required for 15% and 10% of all patients respectively. Overall, 9% of patients died while 78 (77%) patients made a full recovery. HIV patients with COVID-19 experienced a high degree of hospitalization despite having elevated CD4+ cell counts and a high rate of virologic suppression.

The Task Force also provided recommendations for children with hyperinflammation during COVID-19, the acute, infectious phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: The Task Force was composed of 9 pediatric rheumatologists, 2 adult rheumatologists, 2 pediatric cardiologists, 2 pediatric infectious disease specialists, and 1 pediatric critical care physician. Preliminary statements addressing clinical questions related to MIS-C and hyperinflammation in COVID-19 were developed based on evidence reports. Consensus was built through a modified Delphi process that involved anonymous voting and discussion through webinars. A 9-point scale was used to determine the appropriateness of each statement (1-3, inappropriate; 4-6, uncertain; 7-9, appropriate), and consensus was rated as low (L), moderate (M), or high (H) based on dispersion of the votes along the numeric scale. Approved guidance statements had to be classified as appropriate with moderate or high levels of consensus, which were pre-specified prior to voting. RESULTS: The first version of the guidance was approved by the Task Force in June 2020 and consisted of 40 final guidance statements accompanied by a flow diagram depicting the diagnostic pathway for MIS-C. The document was revised in November 2020, and a new flow diagram with recommendations for initial immunomodulatory treatment of MIS-C was added. CONCLUSION: Our understanding of SARS-CoV-2-related syndromes in the pediatric population continues to evolve. This guidance document reflects currently available evidence coupled with expert opinion but is meant to be modified as additional data become available.","Henderson, Lauren A; Canna, Scott W; Friedman, Kevin G; Gorelik, Mark; Lapidus, Sivia K; Bassiri, Hamid; Behrens, Edward M; Ferris, Anne; Kernan, Kate F; Schulert, Grant S; Seo, Philip; Son, Mary Beth F; Tremoulet, Adriana H; Yeung, Rae S M; Mudano, Amy S; Turner, Amy S; Karp, David R; Mehta, Jay J",Arthritis rheumatol.

We studied the impact of COVID-19 on acute stroke care in our health system serving Southeast Michigan as we rolled out a policy to limit admissions and transfers. METHODS: in this retrospective study conducted at two stroke centers, we included consecutive patients presenting to the ED for whom a stroke alert was activated during the period extending from 3/20/20 to 5/20/20 and a similar period in 2019. We compared demographics, time metrics, and discharge outcomes between the two groups. RESULTS: of 385 patients presented to the ED during the two time periods, 58% were African American. There was a significant decrease in the number of stroke patients presenting to the ED and admitted to the hospital between the two periods (p <0.001). In 2020, patients had higher presenting NIHSS (median: 2 vs 5, p = 0.012), discharge NIHSS (median: 2 vs 3, p = 0.004), and longer times from LKW to ED arrival (4.8 vs 9.4 h, p = 0.031) and stroke team activation (median: 10 vs 15 min, p = 0.006). In 2020, stroke mimics rates were lower among African Americans. There were fewer hospitalizations (p <0.001), and transfers from outside facilities (p = 0.015). CONCLUSION: a trend toward faster stroke care in the ED was observed during the pandemic along with dramatically reduced numbers of ED visits, hospitalizations and stroke mimics. Delayed ED presentations and higher stroke severity characterized the African American population, highlighting deepening of racial disparities during the pandemic.","Aboul Nour, Hassan; Affan, Muhammad; Mohamed, Ghada; Mohamud, Ali; Schultz, Lonni; Latack, Katie; Brady, Megan; Scozzari, Dawn; Haddad, Yazeed; Katramados, Angelos; Bou Chebl, Alex; Ramadan, Ahmad Riad",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,404

Although a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is now available, effective antiviral drugs to treat coronavirus diseases are not available yet. Recently, EGCG, a green tea polyphenol, was reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL-protease, however the effect of EGCG on coronavirus replication is unknown. In this report, human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 (beta coronavirus) and HCoV-229E (alpha coronavirus) were used to examine the effect of EGCG on coronavirus. EGCG treatment decreases 3CL-protease activity of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E. Moreover, EGCG treatment decreased HCoV-OC43-induced cytotoxicity. Finally, we found that EGCG treatment decreased the levels of coronavirus RNA and protein in infected cell media. These results indicate that EGCG inhibits coronavirus replication.","Jang, Minsu; Park, Rackhyun; Park, Yea-In; Cha, Yeo-Eun; Yamamoto, Ayane; Lee, Jin I; Park, Junsoo",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,404

Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 among the health care workers. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from May till mid-July among 389 health care workers from government and private hospitals in Saudi Arabia. Data was collected using a pre-structured online questionnaire that measured adverse psychological outcomes, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scale and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale. The Pearson chi-square test was used to assess the distribution of depression and anxiety among health care workers. RESULTS: A high level of anxiety was recorded among the health care workers, and 69.3% of health care workers below the age of 40 were found to have depression. There was a significant increase in depression among staff with chronic health problems (72.1% vs. 61.9%; p = 0.048). High anxiety levels were detected among young staff compared to others (68.7% vs. 43.8%; p = 0.001). Moreover, 82.1% of the female staff were anxious, as compared to 55.6% of the males (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We found increased prevalence of adverse psychological outcomes among the health care workers in Saudi Arabia during the outbreak of COVID-19. Therefore, there is a need for proper screening and development of corresponding preventive measures to decrease the adverse psychological outcomes.","Alamri, Hasan S; Mousa, Wesam F; Algarni, Abdullah; Megahid, Shehata F; Al Bshabshe, Ali; Alshehri, Nada N; Alsamghan, Awad; Alsabaani, Abdullah; Mirdad, Rasha T; Alshahrani, Asrar M; Gadah, Alya A; Alshehri, Almah A",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,404

This commentary shares with the international community how an adaptive model of health system organization and responses helped Vietnam to break transmission of coronavirus. We find that an effective model is adaptive to time and context, and mobilizes and engages the wider society. We identify merging of different health system units into Center for Diseases Controls as a health system organization that saved massive resources. The early establishment of a formal committee responding to the pandemic helped unify every public health strategy. The mobilization of different stakeholders and communities added resources and facilitated a synchronous implementation of response strategies, even where those strategies involved significant personal or financial sacrifice. National training on Covid-19 treatment for healthcare professionals across the entire hospital system was useful to expand the health service availability. Quickly published response guidelines helped to activate every level of the health system and involve every sector of society.

Previous studies have suggested the potential use of olfactometry to identify infected individuals. We performed a sequential olfactometry using the odor stick identification test for Japanese (OSIT-J) in a COVID-19 patient without pneumonia. The test uses 12 odorants that are familiar to the Japanese population. Our patient was a 56-year-old man diagnosed with COVID-19 who was admitted to our hospital following the development of anosmia. He had no respiratory symptoms except pharyngeal pain. Chest CT findings did not reveal the presence of pneumonia. The patient underwent OSIT-J on the 1st hospital day, and his score was 1 out of 12. Following the olfactometry, ciclesonide was administered. The patient did not develop any new symptoms during hospitalization, and his anosmia was gradually improved. The OSIT-J scores were 9 and 11 on the 7th and 16th hospital day, respectively. The patient was discharged on the 25th hospital day after two negative PCR test results. In our case, OSIT-J could identify anosmia in a COVID-19 patient.

There is a need for psychometrically sound and feasible measures that assess emotional eating in children and adolescents. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the convergent and discriminant validity of the 10-item Emotional Eating Scale Adapted for Children and Adolescents (EES-C) Short-Form in a community sample of adolescents. We also sought to assess the reliability and structural validity of this measure. METHODS: Participants were 128 adolescents ages 13 to 19 years (mean age = 15.10 years; SD = 2.09; 53.9% female). Most participants fell within the healthy BMI range (58.6%). Participants completed the EES-C Short-Form, the loss of control eating section of the Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns-Adolescent Version 5, the Gratitude Questionnaire-Six-Item Form, and a demographic questionnaire. RESULTS: Convergent validity of the EES-C Short-Form was supported in that adolescents who endorsed loss of control eating reported significantly greater levels of emotional eating (mean = 24.37; SD = 8.94) compared to adolescents who did not endorse loss of control eating (mean = 19.42; SD = 7.33; p &#8804; .01; d = 0.61). The EES-C Short-Form was significantly correlated with a subjective measure of loss of control eating (rs = -0.255; p = .004), further demonstrating convergent validity. The EES-C Short-Form exhibited discriminant validity as demonstrated by a small, non-significant correlation with the Gratitude Questionnaire-Six-Item Form (rs = 0.086; p = .347). The EES-C Short-Form demonstrated acceptable reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.84; Ordinal alpha = 0.88; Coefficient omega = 0.85) and a unidimensional factor structure (CFI = 0.98; NNFI = 0.98; RMSEA = 0.08).

311314,School feeding in Covid-19 times: mapping of public policy execution strategies by state administration,2020,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is conventionally treated with chemotherapy in eligible patients. Potentially curative regimens are associated with significant toxicity, and the major cost drivers in AML historically have been hospitalization and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The past several years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of treatment options, including oral therapies and drugs targeted to biological pathways implicated in AML. Major current and future drivers of cost in AML include hospitalization and medical costs, stem cell transplantation for eligible patients, and medication costs. It is likely that hospitalization and medical costs will decline as more AML treatment moves to the outpatient setting. Stem cell transplantation costs may increase, if more patients are eligible for improved procedures, although the overall cost of transplantation could decrease if new procedures reduce the need for hospitalization. Medication costs are likely to increase, with various branded drugs available and in development. From a broader perspective, another driver of cost is the proportion of patients with AML who can undergo treatment. Patients who may previously have been unable to tolerate chemotherapy are more likely to be treated with the range of less intensive, more tolerable options now available. The effectiveness of newer AML treatment options also suggests that, overall, there may be more patients staying alive and on treatment longer than in the past. While certain advances, such as increased use of oral and outpatient therapies, could potentially reduce costs, the overall economic impact of AML is likely to increase as more patients are eligible for novel therapies across several phases from induction to maintenance to relapsed/refractory disease. While these novel therapies have the potential to deliver value in the form of improved efficacy, safety, and convenience, payers will need to determine how to cover a longer, more complex AML treatment pathway.","Forsythe, Anna Sandman Karen",Journal of Blood Medicine,,404

There is an urgent need to look for alternative strategies for COVID-19 treatment especially in the case of severe and/or critically ill patients with cytokine release syndrome (CRS). AIM: Convalescent plasma proved to increase survival rates in other severe viral infections. Therefore, convalescent plasma could be a promising treatment option for severe COVID-19 patients. METHOD: In our article, we present the first two critically ill Hungarian patients with COVID-19 infection treated with convalescent fresh frozen plasma. RESULTS: At the time of plasma therapy both patients were on mechanical ventilation and received antiviral agents and a full scale of supportive care. Each patient received 3 × 200 mL of convalescent plasma of recently recovered donors with sufficient novel anti-coronavirus IgG titers. Subsequent to convalescent plasma infusion, oxygenization improved and inflammatory markers decreased in both individuals. As compared to pretransfusion, lymphocyte counts increased and interleukin-6 level lessened. Both patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. No severe adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience indicates that convalescent plasma therapy is well tolerated and could potentially improve clinical outcomes.

This problem is of particular importance when the false positive test rate is close to the prevalence in the population being tested. An efficient Monte Carlo algorithm for approximating the posterior density is presented, and applied to estimating the Covid-19 infection rate in Santa Clara county, CA using the data reported in [Bendavid 2020]. We show that the true Bayesian posterior places considerably more mass near zero, resulting in a prevalence estimate of 5,000--70,000 infections (median: 42,000) (2.17% (95CI 0.27%--3.63%)), compared to the estimate of 48,000--81,000 infections derived in [Bendavid 2020] using the delta method.

This study examined the psychological impact of media use among people indirectly exposed to the disease during the initial phase of the outbreak. We conducted an internet-based survey on January 28, 2020 (one week after the official declaration of person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus). Media use (media forms, content of media exposure, and media engagement) related to the outbreak and psychological outcomes (positive and negative affect, anxiety, depression, and stress) of 917 Chinese adults was assessed. A series of multivariable regressions were conducted. The results showed that use of new media, rather than traditional media, was significantly associated with more negative affect, depression, anxiety, and stress. Viewing stressful content (i.e., severity of the outbreak, reports from hospital) was associated with more negative affect and depression. Media engagement was also associated with more negative affect, anxiety, and stress. However, viewing heroic acts, speeches from experts, and knowledge of the disease and prevention were associated with more positive affect and less depression. The study suggested new media use and more media engagement was associated with negative psychological outcomes, while certain media content was associated with positive psychological impact. The present study highlights the need for timely public health communication from official sources and suggests that reduced exposure to new media may be beneficial.","Chao, Miao; Xue, Dini; Liu, Tour; Yang, Haibo; Hall, Brian J",J Anxiety Disord,,404

However, currently these are largely unknown in food markets. To this end, we completed field investigations and on-site simulations in areas with relatively high infection rates of COVID-19 at Xinfadi Market. We found that if goods were tainted or personnel in market was infected, normal transaction behaviors between sellers and customers, daily physiological activities, and marketing activities could lead to viral contamination and spread to the surroundings via fomite, droplet or aerosol routes. Environmental factors such as low temperature and high humidity, poor ventilation, and insufficient hygiene facilities and disinfection practices may contribute to viral transmission in Xinfadi Market.

317944,Regulatory agencies in response to the COVID-19 crisis,2020,"Fighting infectious diseases, particularly viral infections, is a demanding task for human health. Targeting the pathogens or targeting the host are different strategies, but with an identical purpose, i.e., to curb the pathogen's spreading and cure the illness. It appears that targeting a host to increase tolerance against pathogens can be of substantial advantage and is a strategy used in evolution. Practically, it has a broader protective spectrum than that of only targeting the specific pathogens, which differ in terms of susceptibility. Methods for host targeting applied in one pandemic can even be effective for upcoming pandemics with different pathogens. This is even more urgent if we consider the possible concomitance of two respiratory diseases with potential multi-organ afflictions such as Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and seasonal flu. Melatonin is a molecule that can enhance the host's tolerance against pathogen invasions. Due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunoregulatory activities, melatonin has the capacity to reduce the severity and mortality of deadly virus infections including COVID-19. Melatonin is synthesized and functions in mitochondria, which play a critical role in viral infections. Not surprisingly, melatonin synthesis can become a target of viral strategies that manipulate the mitochondrial status. For example, a viral infection can switch energy metabolism from respiration to widely anaerobic glycolysis even if plenty of oxygen is available (the Warburg effect) when the host cell cannot generate acetyl-coenzyme A, a metabolite required for melatonin biosynthesis. Under some conditions, including aging, gender, predisposed health conditions, already compromised mitochondria, when exposed to further viral challenges, lose their capacity for producing sufficient amounts of melatonin. This leads to a reduced support of mitochondrial functions and makes these individuals more vulnerable to infectious diseases. Thus, the maintenance of mitochondrial function by melatonin supplementation can be expected to generate beneficial effects on the outcome of viral infectious diseases, particularly COVID-19.","Tan, Dun-Xian; Hardeland, Ruediger",Molecules (Basel),,404

This paper reflects on the differentiated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and responses to it. We unpack some of the effects of the crisis on populations already subject to harassment, persecution and deprivation due to their marginal position in society or their resistance to state power. We illuminate how the current crisis is much more than a health crisis;the ways it exacerbates already existing deprivations;and how it might reveal hitherto unrecognised opportunities through which to make the world a more, rather than less, just and equitable place. Focus is on the way the crisis calls forth amplified forms of repression and consonantly amplified forms of vulnerability as well as reconfigured spaces for the operation of civil society organisations. We forward one key proposition, namely that while securitised responses to the crisis reveal an inherent conservatism, civil society responses reveal an agility and a capacity to innovate. While the inherent conservatism of securitised responses gives cause for serious concern, there is some hope to be found in the potential for innovation of civil society organisations. The revelation of humankind's shared vulnerability that is a feature of the crisis may serve as a springboard for the propagation of progressive change if we keep in mind the fundamentally human, and thus relational, nature of human rights and anti-torture work.","Jefferson, A.

Although the situation is stable to some extent within the developed countries, approximately one million have already died as a consequence of the unique symptomatology that these people displayed. Thus, the need to develop an effective strategy for monitoring, restricting, but especially for predicting the evolution of COVID-19 is urgent, especially in middle-class countries such as Romania. Material and Methods: Therefore, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models have been created, aiming to predict the epidemiological course of COVID-19 in Romania by using two statistical software (STATGRAPHICS Centurion (v.18.1.13) and IBM SPSS (v.20.0.0)). To increase the accuracy, we collected data between the established interval (1 March, 31 August) from the official website of the Romanian Government and the World Health Organization. Results: Several ARIMA models were generated from which ARIMA (1,2,1), ARIMA (3,2,2), ARIMA (3,1,3), ARIMA (3,2,2), ARIMA (3,1,3), ARIMA (2,2,2) and ARIMA (1,2,1) were considered the best models.

In this study, we aimed to reveal the diagnostic value of chest computed tomography (CT) imaging with respect to symptom duration. METHODS: This retrospective study involved patients from five centers, who were admitted with typical COVID-19 symptoms and found to be positive for COVID-19 real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) test. RESULTS: One hundred and five patients with positive COVID-19 rtRT-PCR test were involved in the study. Sixty percent of these patients had chest CT imaging findings consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. The most common chest CT finding was bilateral and subpleural ground-glass opacity in middle-lower lobes of the lungs. Chest CT findings were detected in 85.1% of the patients with a symptom duration of more than 2 days. In receiver operating characteristic analysis of this parameter, area under the curve (AUC) was 0.869, while sensitivity and specificity were 90.5% and 76.2%, respectively. It was notable that chest CT findings were 7.17 times more common among the patients aged 60 years and older, with AUC, specificity, and positive predictive value of 0.768, 88.1%, and 84.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Chest CT imaging is a quite valuable tool in patients with longer than 2 days' duration of symptoms, in whom clinical and epidemiological data support the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. We suggest that the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia should be made with chest CT imaging when rtRT-PCR test cannot be performed or gives a negative result, which is important for public health and to prevent the spread of infection.","Kant, Aydin; Kostakoglu, Ugur; Atalar, Serhat; Erensoy, Sükrü; Sevimli, Tolgahan; Ertunç, Baris; Dalmanoglu, Enes; Yilmaz, Ismail; Ertürk, Ayse; Yilmaz, Gürdal",Ann Thorac Med,,404

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The Health in Prisons Programme (HIPP) of the WHO Regional Office for Europe worked with partner organizations to review regularly the evidence on best practices in prison health and use it to inform policy recommendations at the global level. HIPP issued overarching guidance and specific tools to support implementation of measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 in prisons and other custodial settings. Moreover, to monitor the emergence of outbreaks, the HIPP developed a minimum data set for countries voluntarily to report COVID-19 cases and identify situations in need of direct support. FINDINGS: Since May 2020, the WHO has periodically received data from Member States, leading to the development of country-specific bulletins to support countries and, whenever appropriate, to organize virtual missions to further support ministries and public health bodies responsible for managing COVID-19 in prisons. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The development of a specific set of indicators for prisons enables exploring data in a disaggregated manner. Monitoring response measures developed in prison enables judging their appropriateness to minimize the spread of SARS-CoV2 in prisons and alignment with guidance issued by the WHO.","Alves da Costa, Filipa; Neufeld, Maria; Hamad, Mohamed; Carlin, Eric; Ferreira-Borges, Carina",International journal of prisoner health (Online),,404

The present study investigates the longitudinal effects of subjective successful aging on middle-aged and older adults' emotional and coping responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, and explores an underlying mechanism through perceived time limitation during the pandemic. METHODS: A sample of 311 Hong Kong Chinese middle-aged and older adults (Mage = 64.58, SD = 10.14, Range = 45-90 years) were recruited from an Adult Development and Aging Project and participated in a questionnaire study via an online platform or phone interview. Their levels of subjective successful aging, perceived time limitation, and emotional and coping responses to the pandemic were measured. RESULTS: The respondents who perceived themselves as more successful in aging process reported more positive and fewer negative emotions compared with their counterparts with lower levels of subjective successful aging. The mediation analysis showed that perceived time limitation could partially account for the effects of subjective successful aging on emotional and coping responses. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this study unveil the beneficial effects of subjective views of successful aging on emotional and coping responses to the pandemic through alleviating their perception of time limitation.","Yeung, Dannii Y; Chung, Edwin K H; Lam, Alfred H K; Ho, Alvin K K",BMC Geriatr,,404

327263,Student Engagement in the Online Environment: Certified Public Accountant,2020,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus first discovered at the end of 2019. It has led to more than 50 million confirmed cases and more than 1 million deaths across 219 countries as of 11 November 2020, according to WHO statistics. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV are similar. They are highly pathogenic and threaten public health, impair the economy, and inflict long-term impacts on society. No drug or vaccine has been approved as a treatment for these viruses. Efforts to develop antiviral measures have been hampered by the insufficient understanding of how the human body responds to viral infections at the cellular and molecular levels. RESULTS: In this study, journal articles and transcriptomic and proteomic data surveying coronavirus infections were collected. Response genes and proteins were then identified by differential analyses comparing gene/protein levels between infected and control samples. Finally, the H2V database was created to contain the human genes and proteins that respond to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV infection. CONCLUSIONS: H2V provides molecular information about the human response to infection. It can be a powerful tool to discover cellular pathways and processes relevant for viral pathogenesis to identify potential drug targets. It is expected to accelerate the process of antiviral agent development and to inform preparations for potential future coronavirus-related emergencies.

The etiology of kidney injury appears to be tubular, mainly due to the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the key joint receptor for SARS-CoV-2; however, cases with glomerular implication have also been documented. The multifactorial origin of this renal involvement could include virus-mediated injury, cytokine storm, angiotensin II pathway activation, complement dysregulation, hyper-coagulation, and microangiopathy. We present the renal histological findings from a patient who developed acute kidney injury and de novo nephrotic syndrome, highly suggestive of acute IgA-dominant infection-associated glomerulonephritis (IgA-DIAGN) after SARS-CoV-2 infection, as evidenced by the presence of this virus detected in the renal tissue of the patient via immunohistochemistry assay. In summary, we document the first case of IgA-DIAGN associated to SARS-CoV-2. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 S may act as a super antigen driving the development of multisystem inflammatory syndrome as well as cytokine storm in patients affected by COVID-19, reaching the glomerulus and leading to the development of this novel IgA-DIAGN.","Pérez, Aurora; Torregrosa, Isidro; D039,; Marco, Luis; Juan, Isabel; Terradez, Liria; Solís, Miguel Ángel; Moncho, Francesc; Carda-Batalla, Carmen; Forner, María J; Gorriz, Jose Luis",Viruses,,404

The SIR (susceptible–infected–recovered) model of epidemiologic analysis predicts that there should have been more cases since late March 2020 in Pakistan. We therefore sought to investigate COVID-19's prevalence and epidemiologic trends in Pakistan. Research for COVID-19 is still in its early stages, so data were collected from official websites and research journals, then analyzed for the disease's prevalence, epidemiology, mortality and recoveries. The results indicated that a rapid increase had indeed occurred in the number of COVID-19 infections in Pakistan, with the first case reported on 25 February, 2020. From 25 February 25 to April, 2020, COVID-19 infected 11,155 people in Pakistan, with 237 deaths (2.12%) and 2527 recoveries (19.96%). We found a statistically significant positive correlation between the prevalence of COVID-19 and the mortality ratio (r = 0.983, r 2= 0.966; p ≤ 0.05). We concluded that proper management must be undertaken to improve the quarantine system, and the World Health Organization guidelines must be closely followed to cope with COVID-19. There is no vaccine for COVID-19, so antiviral drugs (interferon alfa, ribavirin) may be useful to prevent COVID-19; however, severe control measures implemented in China have significantly mitigated the spread of COVID-19. Suspected and confirmed cases must be treated in separate rooms. Staying home and social distancing are the safe way to proceed.","Kakakhel, M. A.; Wu, F.; Khan, T.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Switzerland had one of the highest second waves of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe in autumn 2020. Keeping schools open provided a moderate to high exposure environment to study SARS-CoV-2 infections. Children from randomly selected schools and classes, stratified by district, were invited for serological testing of SARS-CoV-2. Parents completed questionnaires on sociodemographic and health related questions. PARTICIPANTS: 275 classes in 55 schools; 2603 children participated in June-July 2020 and 2552 in October-November 2020 (age range 6-16 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serology of SARS-CoV-2 in June-July and October-November 2020, clustering of children who were seropositive within classes, and symptoms in children. RESULTS: In June-July, 74 of 2496 children with serological results were seropositive; in October-November, the number had increased to 173 of 2503. Overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 2.4% (95% credible interval 1.4% to 3.6%) in the summer and 4.5% (3.2% to 6.0%) in late autumn in children who were not previously seropositive, leading to an estimated 7.8% (6.2% to 9.5%) of children who were ever seropositive. Seroprevalence varied across districts (in the autumn, 1.7-15.0%). No significant differences were found among lower, middle, and upper school levels (children aged 6-9 years, 9-13 years, and 12-16 years, respectively). Among the 2223 children who had serology tests at both testing rounds, 28/70 (40%) who were previously seropositive became seronegative, and 109/2153 (5%) who were previously seronegative became seropositive. Symptoms were reported for 22% of children who were seronegative and 29% of children who were newly seropositive since the summer. Between July and November 2020, the ratio of children diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection to those who were seropositive was 1 to 8. At least one child who was newly seropositive was detected in 47 of 55 schools and in 90 of 275 classes. Among 130 classes with a high participation rate, no children who were seropositive were found in 73 (56%) classes, one or two children were seropositive in 50 (38%) classes, and at least three children were seropositive in 7 (5%) classes. Class level explained 24% and school level 8% of variance in seropositivity in the multilevel logistic regression models. CONCLUSIONS: With schools open since August 2020 and some preventive measures in place, clustering of children who were seropositive occurred in only a few classes despite an increase in overall seroprevalence during a period of moderate to high transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the community. Uncertainty remains as to whether these findings will change with the new variants of SARS-CoV-2 and dynamic levels of community transmission.

At the end of 2019, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spread throughout China and other countries around the world, resulting in a viral pandemic. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the correlation between ferritin and disease severity in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we obtained clinical and laboratory data regarding 39 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 from two hospitals in Israel. RESULTS: A significant increase in ferritin levels was demonstrated in patients with moderate and severe disease, compared to patients with mild disease (P = 0.006 and 0.005, respectively). Severe patients had significantly higher levels of ferritin (2817.6 ng/ml) than non-severe patients (708.6 ng/ml) P = 0.02. CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary cross-sectional study, elevated ferritin levels were shown to correlate with disease severity in 39 patients from Israel with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Our results further strengthen the hypothesis that severe COVID-19 disease might be due to an underlying dysregulated hyperimmune response. In order to identify these patients early and prioritized resources, we believe that all patients with COVID-19 should be screened for hyperferritinemia.","Dahan, Shani; Segal, Gad; Katz, Itai; Hellou, Tamar; Tietel, Michal; Bryk, Gabriel; Amital, Howard; Shoenfeld, Yehuda; Dagan, Amir",Isr Med Assoc J,,404

This study examined COVID-19-related knowledge, practices, perceptions and associated factors amongst undergraduate veterinary medical students in Nigeria. A cross-sectional web survey was employed to collect data from 437 consenting respondents using pre-tested self-administered questionnaire (August 2020). Demographic factors associated with the knowledge and adoption of recommended preventive practices towards COVID-19 were explored using multivariate logistic regression at P &#8804; 0.05. The respondents' mean knowledge and practice scores were 22.7 (SD ± 3.0) and 24.1 (SD ± 2.9), respectively with overall 63.4% and 88.8% displaying good knowledge and satisfactory practice levels.

While only 30% of the respondents perceived the pandemic as a scam or a disease of the elites (24.0%), the respondents were worried about their academics being affected negatively (55.6%). Veterinary Medical Students in Nigeria had good knowledge and satisfactory preventive practices towards COVID-19; albeit with essential gaps in the key non-pharmaceutical preventive measures recommended by the WHO.

A rápida propagação da doença e o uso do distanciamento como forma de prevenção expuseram as desigualdades sociais e urbanas das cidades capitalistas. No Brasil, como em outros países, o isolamento social promoveu rápidas mudanças no mercado de trabalho, com impactos mais severos para 37,3 milhões de pessoas que vivem na informalidade, já que elas não têm direitos como Fundo de Garantia por Tempo de Serviço (FGTS) e seguro-desemprego. Para a Organização Internacional do Trabalho (OIT), as primeiras demissões estão ocorrendo entre aqueles que vivem do trabalho precário, como terceirizados, balconistas, garçons, funcionários de cozinha, diaristas, manipuladores de bagagem e produtos de limpeza. Assim, faremos uma breve síntese das consequências que a crise sanitária vem promovendo para os trabalhadores brasileiros, bem como proporemos medidas de enfrentamento que não se limitem aos auxílios emergenciais. A recuperação e a criação de ocupações dependerão, entre outros fatores, da retomada dos gastos com programas sociais e econômicos que reduziram as desigualdades sociais no início deste século, como o Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento em Favelas (PAC-Favelas); o Programa Minha Casa, Minha Vida; o Programa Bolsa Família (PBF); e o Programa de Geração de Emprego e Renda (Proger) com recursos do Fundo de Amparo ao Trabalhador (FAT).

Intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) is the most common form of image guidance during liver surgery. However, during laparoscopic hepatectomies (LH), IOUS has several limitations and its reliability has been poorly evaluated. The objective of this work is to evaluate VRCT (virtual real-time CT-guided volume navigation) during LH. This system aims to provide accurate anatomical orientation for surgeons enhancing the safety of LH. METHODS: Twenty-seven hepatic neoplasms were resected laparoscopically at our institution under reference guidance of VRCT. During operation, electromagnetic tracking of the surgical instrument was used for navigating the direction of accurate liver transection. RESULTS: Twenty-six (96.3%) of the 27 lesions (mean diameter 11 mm) were successfully performed under VRCT guidance. Average registration time was < 2 min. Average setup time was approximately 7 min per procedure. VRCT allows the surgeon to navigate liver transection with acceptable accuracy. The mean error was 12 mm. All surgical margins were negative and the mean histologic resection margin was 9 mm. CONCLUSIONS: VRCT-guided LH is feasible and provides valuable real-time anatomical feedback during hepatic resections. Advancement of such systems to improve accuracy might greatly compensate for the limitation of laparoscopic IOUS.","Aoki, Takeshi; Mansour, Doaa A; Koizumi, Tomotake; Wada, Yusuke; Enami, Yuta; Fujimori, Akira; Kusano, Tomokazu; Matsuda, Kazuhiro; Nogaki, Koji; Tashiro, Yoshihiko; Hakozaki, Tomoki; Shibata, Hideki; Tomioka, Kodai; Hirai, Takahito; Yamazaki, Tatsuya; Saito, Kazuhiko; Goto, Satoru; Watanabe, Makoto; Otsuka, Koji; Murakami, Masahiko",J. gastrointest. surg,,404

338096,COVID-19 and the gendered markets of people and products: explaining inequalities in infections and deaths,2020,"In response to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, each country has adopted different measures for its control, for instance, complete lockdown, smart lockdown based on hotspot analysis, and/or strict movement control on their residents. The effectiveness of such controls depends largely on public knowledge, attitude, and practices towards this novel virus. The prime objective of this study is to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of university students and graduates in Pakistan regarding COVID-19. For this purpose, cross-sectional data is collected from 1789 participants through an online survey conducted between July 12 and August 10. The survey instrument consists of demographic characteristics, 13 items on knowledge, 6 items on attitudes, and 3 items on practices, modified from a previously published questionnaire on COVID-19. Our statistical analyses are based on descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The overall correct response rate of the knowledge section is 73%, which is comparatively lower than similar studies in the region. The majority of participants are optimistic about the successful control of COVID-19 in Pakistan, and following the instructions issued by the government of Pakistan. However, a bulk of participants showed skepticism and no trust in the health facilities of hospitals in Pakistan, which could be the potential explanation of falling confirmed cases in Pakistan. In addition, a low knowledge score is found to be significantly associated with low confidence in successful control of COVID-19, and socially undesirable practices. The results suggest an urgent need for health education programs to hold optimistic attitudes and rebuilding of trust of the general public in health facilities in local hospitals to avoid the possible next wave of COVID-19 in Pakistan.","Arslan Iqbal, Muhammad; Zeeshan Younas, Muhammad",Child Youth Serv Rev,,404
339867,Digital surveillance systems to combat COVID-19 may do more harm than good,2020,"Many studies in the literature have highlighted the utility of virtual 3D databanks as a substitute for real skeletal collections and the important application of radiological records in personal identification. However, none have investigated the accuracy of virtual material compared to skeletal remains in nonmetric variant analysis using 3D models. The present study investigates the accuracy of 20 computed tomography (CT) 3D reconstruction models compared to the real crania, focusing on the quality of the reproduction of the real crania and the possibility to detect 29 dental/cranial morphological variations in 3D images. An interobserver analysis was performed to evaluate trait identification, number, position, and shape. Results demonstrate a false bone loss in 3D models in some cranial regions, specifically the maxillary and occipital bones in 85% and 20% of the samples. Additional analyses revealed several difficulties in the detection of cranial nonmetric traits in 3D models, resulting in incorrect identification in circa 70% of the traits. In particular, pitfalls included the detection of erroneous position, error in presence/absence rates, in number, and in shape. The lowest percentages of correct evaluations were found in traits localized in the lateral side of the cranium and for the infraorbital suture, mastoid foramen, and crenulation. The present study highlights important pitfalls in CT scan when compared with the real crania for nonmetric analysis. This may have crucial consequences in cases where 3D databanks are used as a source of reference population data for nonmetric traits and pathologies and during bone-CT comparisons for identification purposes.","Bertoglio, Barbara; Corradin, Sofia; Cappella, Annalisa; Mazzarelli, Debora; Biehler-Gomez, Lucie; Messina, Carmelo; Pozzi, Grazia; Sconfienza, Luca Maria; Sardanelli, Francesco; Sforza, Chiarella; De Angelis, Danilo; Cattaneo, Cristina",J. forensic sci,,404

The aim of this study is to report on the clinical characteristics and the predictors of mortality in hospitalized AA patients with COVID-19 infection. In this retrospective cohort review, we included all AA patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to an inner-city teaching community hospital in New York city. Demographics, clinical presentation, baseline co-morbidities, and laboratory data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The predictors of mortality were assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Of the 408 (median age, 67 years) patients included, 276 (66.65%, median age 63 years) survived while 132 (33.35%, median age 71 years) died. The most common presenting symptoms were cough, myalgia, fever/chills, shortness of breath, and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain), with a prevalence of 62.50%, 43.87%, 53.68%, and 27.21%, respectively.

In this scenario, managing acute medical conditions, such as stroke, requires a timely treatment together with proper strategies that minimize the risk of infection spreading to health care workers and other patients. We report the case of a 79-year-old woman, who was admitted for a wake-up stroke due to occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery. She was treated outside the COVID-19-dedicated track of the hospital because she had no concomitant signs or symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection nor recent contact with other infected individuals. Post-mortem nasal and pharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We propose that hyperacute stroke patients should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection at admission and then managed as having COVID-19 until cleared by a negative result. We are aware that such measure results in some delay of the acute treatment of stroke, which could be minimal using well-exercised containment protocols.","Papi, Claudia; Spagni, Gregorio; Alexandre, Andrea; Calabresi, Paolo; Della Marca, Giacomo; Broccolini, Aldobrando",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,404

However, social isolation leads to significant psycho-emotional changes. This study aimed to assess the effect of distance education (DE) activities implemented due to social isolation, on the quality of life of undergraduate dentistry students. METHOD: An e-questionnaire (Google Forms® ) was administered to identify specific DE activities after social isolation and included the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL)-Bref questionnaire. The e-questionnaire was sent 14 days after the initiation of social isolation, remaining available for 48 hours. Cronbach's alpha and the means of the quality-of-life domains were calculated and analysed using the Friedman/Dunn and Spearman's correlation tests. After ranking, chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests plus multinomial logistic regression were performed (SPSS, P < .05). RESULT: There was an excellent internal consistency of WHOQOL-Bref (&#945; = 0.916), and the mean quality of life (0-100) was 70.66 ± 12.61. The psychological domain was the most affected (P < .001). The social domain exhibited the weakest correlation with overall quality of life (P < .001, r = 0.688). The use of the Internet, cell phones and streaming media increased, although all students had DE activities. In the multivariate analysis, attending virtual meetings (P = .028) and performing DE activities in an office/study room (P = .034) were significantly associated with good quality of life. CONCLUSION: Facing social isolation never previously experienced by this generation, undergraduate dentistry students are at risk of reduced quality of life.

347651,Resuming cadaver dissection during a pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Contact tracing is a crucial part of the public health surveillance toolkit. However, it is labor-intensive and costly to carry it out. Some countries have faced challenges implementing contact tracing, and no impact evaluations using empirical data have assessed its impact on COVID-19 mortality. This study assesses the impact of contact tracing in a middle-income country, providing data to support the expansion and optimization of contact tracing strategies to improve infection control. METHODS: We obtained publicly available data on all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Colombia between March 2 and June 16, 2020. (N = 54,931 cases over 135 days of observation). As suggested by WHO guidelines, we proxied contact tracing performance as the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing out of all cases identified. We calculated the daily proportion of cases identified through contact tracing across 37 geographical units (32 departments and five districts). Further, we used a sequential log-log fixed-effects model to estimate the 21-days, 28-days, 42-days, and 56-days lagged impact of the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing on daily COVID-19 mortality. Both the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing and the daily number of COVID-19 deaths are smoothed using 7-day moving averages. Models control for the prevalence of active cases, second-degree polynomials, and mobility indices. Robustness checks to include supply-side variables were performed. RESULTS: We found that a 10 percent increase in the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing is related to COVID-19 mortality reductions between 0.8% and 3.4%. Our models explain between 47%-70% of the variance in mortality. Results are robust to changes of specification and inclusion of supply-side variables. CONCLUSION: Contact tracing is instrumental in containing infectious diseases. Its prioritization as a surveillance strategy will substantially impact reducing deaths while minimizing the impact on the fragile economic systems of lower and middle-income countries. This study provides lessons for other LMIC.","Vecino-Ortiz, Andres I; Villanueva Congote, Juliana; Zapata Bedoya, Silvana; Cucunuba, Zulma M",PLoS One,,404

We evaluated for differences in demographic and clinical characteristics, levels of social isolation and loneliness, and the occurrence and severity of common symptoms between oncology patients with low versus high levels of COVID-19 and cancer-related stress. In addition, we determined which of these characteristics were associated with membership in the high stressed group. METHODS: - Patients were >18 years of age; had a diagnosis of cancer; and were able to complete an online survey. RESULTS: Of the 187 patients in this study, 31.6% were categorized in the stressed group (Impact of Event Scale -Revised (IES-R score of >24)). Stressed group's IES-R score exceeds previous benchmarks in oncology patients and equates with probable PTSD. In this stressed group, patients reported occurrence rates for depression (71.2%), anxiety (78.0%), sleep disturbance (78.0%), evening fatigue (55.9%), cognitive impairment (91.5%), and pain (75.9%). Symptom severity scores equate with clinically meaningful levels for each symptom. CONCLUSIONS: - We identified alarmingly high rates of stress and an extraordinarily high symptom burden among cancer patients, exceeding those previously benchmarked in this population and on par with non-cancer patients with PTSD. Given that the COVID19 pandemic will likely impact cancer care for an indefinite period of time, clinicians must exhibit increased vigilance in their assessments of patients' level of stress and symptom burden. Moreover, an increase in referrals to appropriate supportive care resources must be prioritized for high risk patients.","Miaskowski, Christine; Paul, Steven M; Snowberg, Karin; Abbott, Maura; Borno, Hala; Chang, Susan; Chen, Lee May; Cohen, Bevin; Hammer, Marilyn J; Kenfield, Stacey A; Kober, Kord M; Levine, Jon D; Pozzar, Rachel; Rhoads, Kim F; Van Blarigan, Erin L; Van Loon, Katherine",J. pain symptom manage,,404
348052,Vulnerabilidade socioeconômica à COVID-19 em municípios do Ceará/ Vulnerabilidad socioeconómica a la COVID-19 en municipios de Ceará/ Socioeconomic vulnerability in the face of COVID-19 in municipalities of Ceará,2020,"Cardiovascular disease is a frequent complication and the most common cause of death in patients with CKD. Despite landmark medical advancements, mortality due to cardiovascular disease is still 20 times higher in CKD patients than in the general population, which is mainly due to the high prevalence of risk factors in this group. Indeed, in addition to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, CKD patients are exposed to nontraditional ones, which include metabolic, hormonal, and inflammatory alterations. The global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has brought novel challenges for both cardiologists and nephrologists alike. Emerging evidence indicates that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increases the risk of cardiovascular events and that several aspects of the disease may synergize with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors in CKD patients. A better understanding of these mechanisms is pivotal for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular events in this context, and we believe that additional clinical and experimental studies are needed to improve cardiovascular outcomes in CKD patients with COVID-19. In this review, we provide a summary of traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors in CKD patients, discussing their interaction with SARS-CoV-2 infection and focusing on CO-VID-19-related cardiovascular complications that may severely affect short- and long-term outcomes in this high-risk population.","Podestà, Manuel Alfredo; Valli, Federica; Galassi, Andrea; Cassia, Matthias A; Ciceri, Paola; Barbieri, Lucia; Carugo, Stefano; Cozzolino, Mario",Blood Purif,,404

Treatment of COVID-19 especially in solid organ transplant recipients is empirical and controversial, especially the adjustment of the immunosuppressants. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 29-year-old kidney transplant recipient with the symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia. DIAGNOSES: COVID-19 pneumonia after kidney transplantation. INTERVENTIONS: He was treated with modified immunosuppressants (unchanged dose of tacrolimus and oral corticosteroids while discontinuing mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)), antibiotics, interferon &#945;-2b inhalation and traditional Chinese medicine. OUTCOMES: He recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia after 29 days of hospitalization. And the renal function (measured as blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and urine protein) returned to normal. LESSONS: In certain group of COVID-19 (e.g., mild to moderate cases, young patients without comorbidities), a reduction instead of an overall withdrawal of immunosuppressant in kidney transplant recipients is feasible.","Chen, Dong; Yang, Bo; Zhang, Yan; Chen, Liang; Wei, Lai; Zhang, Weijie; Wang, Xinqiang; Tong, Xiaolin; Chen, Zhishui",Medicine (Baltimore),,404

349654,Legal exploration of right to health,2021,"Smart home security and safety systems have gained more importance in recent years. This is attributable to their significant impact in reducing and preventing loss of assets and human life. The COVID-19 pandemic adds a new dimension to home security as potentially infected people or those not taking necessary precautions such as sanitization or wearing masks may enter homes and cause further transmission. The traditional security systems are effective in conventional scenarios but require human intervention and contact which can lead to the spread of the virus. This necessitates the development of smart security systems that are autonomous and contactless. This paper presents a novel IoT enabled home security system that restricts unauthorized access and at the same time ensures that permitted users are normothermic and are following proper COVID hygiene. The proposed system is a smart edge device that does not require a cloud platform for its computational needs. Facial recognition is used to authenticate and allow approved users to get access. If an unfamiliar person tries to enter the premises, the system takes a photo, computes mask detection on the image, measures temperature and sends these three data points as a WhatsApp notification to the administrative user. The door lock can then be controlled automatically or remotely using a WhatsApp bot. © 2021 IEEE.","Sethi, K.; Kaul, S.; Patel, I.; Sujatha, R.","6th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Signal Processing and Networking, WiSPNET 2021",,404

The objective of our study was to conduct a living systematic review and meta-analyses of studies reporting pregnancy and neonatal outcomes by comparing the pandemic and pre-pandemic periods. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase databases, reference lists of articles published up until 14 May 2021 and included English language studies that compared outcomes between the COVID-19 pandemic time period and pre-pandemic time periods. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis using the inverse variance method. RESULTS: Thirty-seven studies with low-to-moderate risk of bias, reporting on 1 677 858 pregnancies during the pandemic period and 21 028 650 pregnancies during the pre-pandemic period, were included. There was a significant reduction in unadjusted estimates of PTB (28 studies, unadjusted odds ratio [uaOR] 0.94, 95% confidence [CI] 0.91-0.98) but not in adjusted estimates (six studies, adjusted OR [aOR] 0.95, 95% CI 0.80-1.13). The reduction was noted in studies from single centers/health areas (uaOR 0.90, 95% CI 0.86-0.94) but not in regional/national studies (uaOR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95-1.03). There was reduction in spontaneous PTB (five studies, uaOR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.98) and induced PTB (four studies, uaOR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81-1.00). There was no reduction in PTB when stratified by gestational age <34, <32 or <28 weeks. There was no difference in stillbirths between the pandemic and pre-pandemic time periods (21 studies, uaOR 1.08, 95% CI 0.94-1.23; four studies, aOR 1.06, 95% CI 0.81-1.38). There was an increase in birthweight (six studies, mean difference 17 g, 95% CI 7-28 g) during the pandemic period. There was an increase in maternal mortality (four studies, uaOR 1.15, 95% CI 1.05-1.26), which was mostly influenced by one study from Mexico. There was significant publication bias for the outcome of PTB. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic time period may be associated with a reduction in PTB; however, referral bias cannot be excluded. There was no difference in stillbirth between the pandemic and pre-pandemic period.","Yang, Jie; D039,; Souza, Rohan; Kharrat, Ashraf; Fell, Deshayne B; Snelgrove, John W; Murphy, Kellie E; Shah, Prakesh S",Acta obstet. gynecol. scand,,404

Two pairs of primers were specifically designed to recognize the six different sequences of open reading frame1 (ORF1) gene. The optimized LAMP program was as follows: 50â¯min at 59â¯°C followed by 3â¯min at 80â¯°C.The amplified products were analyzed both by visual inspection after staining with SYBR Green I dye and by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. Both methods showed the same sensitivity. The limit of detection (LOD) for PPV by LAMP was 10 copies, which is 100-fold lower than conventional PCR. Our LAMP assay did not cross-react with other viruses. We used the established LAMP system to test 1100 field samples and detected 660 positives. The LAMP detection method for PPV represents a visual, sensitive and rapid assay which can detect the virus in the field, offering an attractive alternative for the PPV detection methods currently in use.","Zhao, Kai; Hu, Ruili; Ni, Jianping; Liang, Jieling; He, Xizhong; Du, Yanan; Xu, Yan; Zhao, Binan; Zhang, Qi; Li, Chunhua",J Virol Methods,,404

Presentation of case: Male patient, 69 years old, asthmatic, ex-smoker and bearer of systemic arterial hypertension, has been admitted to the emergency department with sudden onset of pain in the right lower limb (RLL), associated with cyanosis and reduced temperature of the limb. He has been tested for COVID-19 in the OR with positive result for IGG and IGM. Computed tomography angiography (AngioCT) was performed, showing signs of arterial embolization to both limbs, right internal iliac artery, and superior mesenteric artery. Faced with the threat of limb loss and the absence of signs and symptoms of visceral ischemia, the patient underwent full anticoagulation and RLL thromboembolectomy and tricompartmental fasciotomy. He was discharged after 7 days of hospitalization and demonstrated no other signs and symptoms of COVID-19, following outpatient follow-up. Discussion: COVID-19 is associated with high risk of thrombotic complications being related to the clinical severity of the patient, with few studies that show symptoms of sudden pain in the lower limb without other complaints. Conclusion: Individuals infected with COVID-19 are at risk for arterial thromboembolic events, and knowledge of such cases is essential in order to create specific protocols for prophylaxis of thrombotic events in these patients, in addition to increasing the suspicion of infection in individuals with acute arterial occlusion, mostly during pandemic times.","Costa, Víctor de Oliveira; de Almeida, Guilherme Bicalho Civinelli; Nicolini, Eveline Montessi; Rodrigues, Guilherme de Abreu; da Costa, Bruna Malaquias Arguelles; Carvalho, Guilherme Heluey; Dos Reis, Álvaro Luiz Segregio; Colen, Davi Pinto",Int J Surg Case Rep,,404

Stay-at-home order status and personal distancing were independently associated with higher symptoms, beyond protective effects of available social resources (social support and social network size). A subsample of 118 participants who had completed symptom measures earlier in the outbreak (February 2020) showed increases in depression and GAD between February and March, and personal distancing behavior was associated with these increases.

In this study, we used a cell-based infection assay to screen more than 3,000 agents used in humans and animals, including 2,855 small molecules and 190 traditional herbal medicines, and identified 15 active small molecules in concentrations ranging from 0.1 nM to 50 µM. Two enzymatic assays, along with molecular modeling, were then developed to confirm those targeting the virus 3CL protease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Several water extracts of herbal medicines were active in the cell-based assay and could be further developed as plant-derived anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. Some of the active compounds identified in the screen were further tested in vivo, and it was found that mefloquine, nelfinavir, and extracts of Ganoderma lucidum (RF3), Perilla frutescens, and Mentha haplocalyx were effective in a challenge study using hamsters as disease model.","Jan, Jia-Tsrong; Cheng, Ting-Jen Rachel; Juang, Yu-Pu; Ma, Hsiu-Hua; Wu, Ying-Ta; Yang, Wen-Bin; Cheng, Cheng-Wei; Chen, Xiaorui; Chou, Ting-Hung; Shie, Jiun-Jie; Cheng, Wei-Chieh; Chein, Rong-Jie; Mao, Shi-Shan; Liang, Pi-Hui; Ma, Che; Hung, Shang-Cheng; Wong, Chi-Huey",Proc.

Therefore, based on the time-series data from China, spanning from the time period of 01-Jan-2020 to 15-Mar-2021, the quantile autoregressive distributed lag method (QARDL) method has been applied, as the preferred statistical technique for this study. The results have reported that there happens to be a negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, on the industry across all the considered quantiles, representing the bearish, normal, and bullish market conditions. Therefore, based on these findings, the government regulations' full compliance regarding social distancing and health assurance has been recommended. © 2021 The Author(s).

In May, the infection numbers registered a fall followed by a second new rise, not proportionally reflected by an increase in the number of deaths. We aimed to investigate the relationship between disease prevalence and infection fatality rate (IFR), and the number of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital admissions over time, to develop a predictive model, as well as appraising the potential contributing factors underpinning this complex relationship. METHODS: A prospective epidemiological study using data from six countries collected between 10 March and 4 September 2020. Data on the number of daily hospital and ICU admissions with COVID-19 were gathered, and the IFR and the prevalence were calculated. Trends over time were analysed. A linear regression model was used to determine the association between the fatality rates and the number of admissions. FINDINGS: The prediction model confirmed the linear association between the fatality rates and the numbers of ICU and hospital admissions. The exception was during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic when the model underestimated the fatalities indicating that a substantial number of deaths occurred outside of the hospitals. The fatality rates decreased in all countries from May until September regardless of the trends in prevalence, differences in healthcare systems or strategic variations in handling the pandemic. INTERPRETATION: The observed gradual reduction in COVID-19 fatality rates over time despite varying disease prevalence and public health measures across multiple countries warrants search for a biological explanation. While our understanding of this novel virus grows, hospital and ICU admission rates remain effective predictors of patient outcomes which can be used as early warning signs for escalation of public health measures.","Velicu, Maria Alexandra; Furlanetti, Luciano; Jung, Josephine; Ashkan, Keyoumars",BMJ Open,,404
360919,Interfaces of domestic violence and organization: Gendered violence and inequality,2020,"Adaptation of new habits in many aspects of life, including education, is required amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Many countries, including Indonesia, suddenly implement online learning as a realization of social distancing policies. This sudden change in the learning system has become a challenge for teachers. They must be able to integrate technology, pedagogy, and content knowledge to conduct online learning well. Therefore, this study investigates the readiness of biology teachers to face online learning based on their Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). The purposive survey method was used by distributing questionnaires and conducting online interviews. The questionnaire consists of 30 statements about the TPACK readiness of biology teachers and ten questions about the online learning process during the COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 121 biology teachers in West Java, Indonesia, participated in this study. The findings indicate that biology teachers have sufficient TPACK skills in implementing online learning. However, their technological capabilities still need to be improved. The flexibility of place and time, availability of learning resources, and increased independence of teachers and students in using technology are the advantages of online biology learning during the COVID-19 outbreak. Meanwhile, the problems faced by teachers include technical connectivity and student honesty in tak-ing exams in the implementation of online learning. The uncertainty of when the pandemic will end makes this study important to carry out for evaluation and potential improvement of online biology learning systems. © 2021 Science Education Study Program FMIPA UNNES Semarang.","Juanda, A.; Shidiq, A.

361845,Epidemiological update of COVID-19 in Pediatrics. Epidemiological week 32,2020,"The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is an attractive target towards discovery of drugs to treat COVID-19 because of its key role in virus replication. The atomic structure of Mpro in complex with an &#945;-ketoamide inhibitor (Lig13b) is available (PDB ID:6Y2G). Using 6Y2G and the prior knowledge that protease inhibitors could eradicate COVID-19, we designed a computational study aimed at identifying FDA-approved drugs that could interact with Mpro. We searched the DrugBank and PubChem for analogs and built a virtual library containing â¼33,000 conformers. Using high-throughput virtual screening and ligand docking, we identified Isavuconazonium, a ketoamide inhibitor (&#945;-KI) and Pentagastrin as the top three molecules (Lig13b as the benchmark) based on docking energy. The &#916;Gbind of Lig13b, Isavuconazonium, &#945;-KI, Pentagastrin was -28.1, -45.7, -44.7, -34.8 kcal/mol, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed that these ligands are stable within the Mpro active site. Binding of these ligands is driven by a variety of non-bonded interaction, including polar bonds, H-bonds, van der Waals and salt bridges. The overall conformational dynamics of the complexed-Mpro was slightly altered relative to apo-Mpro. This study demonstrates that three distinct classes molecules, Isavuconazonium (triazole), &#945;-KI (ketoamide) and Pentagastrin (peptide) could serve as potential drugs to treat patients with COVID-19.","Achilonu, Ikechukwu; Iwuchukwu, Emmanuel Amarachi; Achilonu, Okechinyere Juliet; Fernandes, Manuel Antonio; Sayed, Yasien",J Mol Graph Model,,404

Methods: A prospective cohort study was undertaken between 17 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 and compared with retrospective data from same time period in 2019. We compared the number of patients requiring acute hospital admission or orthopaedic referrals and indications of referrals from our admission sheets and obtained operative data from our theatre software. Results: Between 17 March to 30 April 2020, there were 48 acute spine referrals as compared to 68 acute referrals during the same time period last year. In the 2019 period, 69% (47/68) of cases referred to the on-call team presented with back pain, radiculopathy or myelopathy compared to 43% (21/48) in the 2020 period. Almost 20% (14/68) of spine referrals consisted of spine trauma as compared to 35% (17/48) this year. There were no confirmed cases of cauda equine last year during this time. Overall, 150 spine cases were carried out during this time period last year, and 261 spine elective cases were cancelled since 17 March 2020. Recommendations: We recommend following steps can be helpful to deal with similar situations or new pandemics in future:24 hours on-call spine service during the pandemic.Clinical criteria in place to prioritize urgent spinal cases.Pre-screening spine patients before elective operating.Start of separate specialist trauma list for patients needing urgent surgeries.

We aimed to quantitatively assess the global change in surgical and oncological clinical practice in the early COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this cross-sectional observational study, we designed a 12-item online survey on the global effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical practice in urology. Demographic survey data, change of clinical practice, current performance of procedures, and current commencement of treatment for 5 conditions in medical urological oncology were evaluated. RESULTS: 235 urologists from 44 countries responded. Out of them, 93% indicated a change of clinical practice due to COVID-19. In a 4-tiered surgery down-escalation scheme, 44% reported to make first cancellations, 23% secondary cancellations, 20% last cancellations and 13% emergency cases only. Oncological surgeries had low cancellation rates (%): transurethral resection of bladder tumor (27%), radical cystectomy (21-24%), nephroureterectomy (21%), radical nephrectomy (18%), and radical orchiectomy (8%). (Neo)adjuvant/palliative treatment is currently not started by more than half of the urologists.

365588,Future-oriented function of meaning in life: Promoting hope via future temporal focus,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Many patients with mild or severe COVID-19 do not make a full recovery and have a wide range of chronic symptoms for weeks or months after infection, often of a neurological, cognitive or psychiatric nature. The epidemiological evidence, diagnostic criteria and pathogenesis of post-COVID-19 syndrome are reviewed. DEVELOPMENT: Post-COVID-19 syndrome is defined by persistent clinical signs and symptoms that appear while or after suffering COVID-19, persist for more than 12 weeks and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. The symptoms can fluctuate or cause relapses. It is a heterogeneous condition that includes post-viral chronic fatigue syndrome, sequelae in multiple organs and the effects of severe hospitalisation/post-intensive care syndrome. It has been reported in patients with mild or severe COVID-19 and irrespective of the severity of the symptoms in the acute phase. Between 10% and 65% of survivors who had mild/moderate COVID-19 present symptoms of post-COVID-19 syndrome for 12 weeks or more. At six months, subjects report an average of 14 persistent symptoms. The most common symptoms are fatigue, dyspnoea, anxiety, depression, and impaired attention, concentration, memory and sleep. The underlying biological mechanisms are unknown, although an abnormal or excessive autoimmune and inflammatory response may play an important role. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical manifestations are diverse, fluctuating and variable, although fatigue and neurocognitive complaints predominate. There is no defined consensus on post-COVID-19 syndrome and its diagnostic criteria have not been subjected to adequate psychometric evaluation.","Carod-Artal, F J",Rev Neurol,,404

STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study in a single-center NICU from January 2012 to December 2017 (n = 1464). We assessed the impact of clinical practice changes including neonatal-nephrology rounds on the incidence of AKI. RESULTS: AKI occurred in 318 neonates (22%). AKI occurred less frequently in those admitted after clinical practice changes (P < 0.001). After multivariable adjustment, clinical practice changes were associated with reduced odds of AKI (adjusted odds ratio, 0.31; 95% CI 0.22-0.44, P < 0.001). Provider reporting of AKI improved (P < 0.001) and more neonates were referred for nephrology follow-up (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Increased nephrology integration in the NICU was associated with decreased AKI incidence. While recognition of AKI improved, AKI remained poorly reported and nephrology AKI follow-up did not routinely occur.

The conductivity, diffusivity and mobility are greater in the composite membrane poly(2,2'-(p-hexafluoroisopropylidene)-5,5'-bibenzimidazole) containing fluorinated groups, reaching a maximum when the amount of H[COSANE] was 15%. In general, all the prepared membranes displayed excellent and tunable properties as conducting materials, with conductivities higher than 0.03 S cm-1 above 140 °C. From an analysis of electrode polarization (EP) the proton diffusion coefficients and mobility have been calculated.","Olvera-Mancilla, Jessica; Escorihuela, Jorge; Alexandrova, Larissa; Andrio, Andreu; García-Bernabé, Abel; Del Castillo, Luis Felipe; Compañ, Vicente",,,404

Materials and Methods: 3T DW and T1- and T2-weighted imaging sequences were done in 34 patients with biopsy-proven primary HNC of 100 cervical LNs &#8805;1 cm in diameter. The mean ADC values were compared with histopathologically proven LNs using the independent t-test. ADC cutoff value was evaluated with sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results: The mean ADC value of reactive LN was 1.2933 × 10-3 mm2/s and metastatic LN was 0.908 × 10-3 mm2/s. An ADC cutoff value was 0.868 × 10-3 mm2/s with 84% sensitivity, 96% specificity, 93% accuracy, 87.5% positive predictive value, and 94.7% negative predictive value. A significant difference in mean ADC value between reactive and metastatic LNs was noted (P< 0.001). Conclusion: 3T DW-MRI is useful in differentiating reactive and metastatic cervical LNs in HNC patients. However, studies with larger sample size have to be performed to validate ADC threshold value with 3T DW-MRI in differentiating between reactive and metastatic LNs for clinical practice.","Vijayalakshmi, K; Raghuram, P H; Saravanan, K; Krithika, C L; Kannan, A",J Cancer Res Ther,,404
371555,Fiscal and monetary response to the COVID-19 pandemic in India,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since, December 2019 a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has caused global public health issue after being reported for the first time in Wuhan province of China. So far, there have been approximately 14.8 million confirmed cases and 0.614 million deaths due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection globally, and still numbers are increasing. Although, the virus has caused a global public health concern, no effective treatment has been developed. OBJECTIVE: One of the strategies to combat the COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is development of vaccines that can make humans immune to these infections. Considering this approach, in this study an attempt has been made to design epitope based vaccine for combatting COVID-19 disease by analyzing the complete proteome of the virus by using immuno-informatics tools. METHODS: The protein sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 was retrieved and the individual proteins were checked for their allergic potential. Then, from non-allergen proteins antigenic epitopes were identified that could bind with MHCII molecules. The epitopes were modeled and docked to predict the interaction with MHCII molecules. The stability of the epitopeMHCII complex was further analyzed by performing molecular dynamic simulation study. The selected vaccine candidates were also analyzed for their global population coverage and conservancy among SARS related coronavirus species. RESULTS: The study has predicted 5 peptide molecules that can act as potential candidate for epitope based vaccine development. Among the 5 selected epitopes, the peptide LRARSVSPK can be the most potent epitope because of its high geometric shape complementarity score, low ACE and very high response to it by the world population (81.81% global population coverage). Further, molecular dynamic simulation analysis indicated the formation of stable epitope-MHCII complex. The epitope LRARSVSPK was also found to be highly conserved among the SARS-CoV-2 isolated from different countries. CONCLUSION: The study has predicted T-cell epitopes that can elicit robust immune response in global human population and act as potential vaccine candidates. However, the ability of these epitopes to act as vaccine candidate needs to be validated in wet lab studies.","Akhtar, Nahid; Joshi, Amit; Singh, Bhupender; Kaushik, Vikas",Infectious disorders.

In Italy, these effects have been particularly pronounced. While research on the COVID-19 outbreak has mainly focused on the clinical features of infected patients and the psychological impact on the general population and health professionals, no investigation has yet assessed the psychological impact of the pandemic on parents. In the present research, we conducted a web-based survey of Italian parents to examine the prevalence of parenting-related exhaustion-and to identify its associated risk and protective factors-4 weeks into the lockdown. METHODS: A total of 1,226 parents provided their consent to participate in the study and completed a demographic questionnaire, information relating to particular COVID-19 experiences, and measures of emotional exhaustion, parental resilience, social connections, and psychological distress during the lockdown. RESULTS: Seventeen percent of our sample experienced significant parenting-related exhaustion, with mothers more severely affected. Multiple regression analyses showed that greater parenting-related exhaustion was predicted by psychological distress, lower parental resilience, motherhood, fewer perceived social connections, and being single, as well as having a child with special needs, having a large number of children, and having younger children. CONCLUSION: The findings add further support to the call for preventive programs to support parents throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health professionals and social workers should be warned of the effects of lockdown and social distancing on parenting and, consequently, the well-being of children.","Marchetti, Daniela; Fontanesi, Lilybeth; Mazza, Cristina; Di Giandomenico, Serena; Roma, Paolo; Verrocchio, Maria Cristina",J Pediatr Psychol,,404

Mature mRNA requires a 5'-cap for gene expression and mRNA stability. There are two methods to add a cap in vitro: via a two-step multi-enzymatic reaction or co-transcriptionally. Co-transcriptional methods minimize reaction steps and enzymes needed to make mRNA when compared to enzymatic capping. CleanCap® AG co-transcriptional capping results in 5 mg/ml of IVT with 94% 5'-cap 1 structure.

373114,Contemplating COVID in Japan,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the risk factors of death in patients with severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and their predictive value. METHODS: Using the clinical and epidemiological database of Yangtze River Shipping General Hospital in Wuhan, the clinical and epidemiological data of 105 patients with severe and critical COVID-19 from January to March in 2020 were collected. Multivariate unconditional Logistic regression method was used to analyze the death risk factors of patients during hospitalization. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn according to the multivariate analysis results to construct a death prediction model; the prediction value of the model was analyzed. RESULTS: The 105 patients with severe and critical COVID-19 were enrolled with 66 males (62.9%) and 39 females (37.1%). The age was (58.2±14.4) years old. Forty-two patients died in hospital and 63 survived. Among the dead patients, 69.0% (29/42) were male, and 78.6% (33/42) were over 60 years old. Compared with survival patients, the non-survival patients were older (years old: 59.2±12.5 vs. 51.2±11.4), and had more comorbidities, including coronary heart disease, hypertension, myocardial damage and thrombocytopenia (coronary heart disease: 33.3% vs. 11.1%, hypertension: 28.6% vs. 9.5%, myocardial damage: 73.8% vs. 11.1%, thrombocytopenia: 61.9% vs. 14.3%), and received more mechanical ventilation (92.9% vs. 44.4%), with significant differences (all P < 0.01). The variables of gender, age, basic diseases, mechanical ventilation and complications were included in the unconditional Logistic regression analysis, which showed that gender [odds ratio (OR) = 2.852, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.122-66.694], age (OR = 3.257, 95%CI was 0.466-18.584), coronary heart disease (OR = 7.337, 95%CI was 0.227-87.021), hypertension (OR = 5.517, 95%CI was 0.258-65.024) and concurrent myocardial damage (OR = 7.322, 95%CI was 0.278-95.020) and thrombocytopenia (OR = 3.968, 95%CI was 0.325-35.549) were independent risk factors for death in patients with severe and critical COVID-19 during hospitalization. According to the risk factors, the death prediction model was constructed and ROC curve was analyzed, which showed that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of death prediction model for predicting the mortality of patients with severe and critical COVID-19 during hospitalization was 0.804, the sensitivity was 83.8%, and the specificity was 82.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Various risk factors are associated with the death of severe or critical COVID-19 patients, such as gender, age, basic diseases and complications. The death prediction model is constructed by gender, age, basic diseases with coronary heart disease and hypertension, concurrent myocardial damage and thrombocytopenia, which has certain predictive value for the death of patients with severe or critical COVID-19.","Hu, Kai; Li, Bojun",Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue,,404
374496,"Pandemic, informality, and vulnerability: impact of COVID-19 on livelihoods in India",2021,"BACKGROUND: The effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women and newborns is incompletely understood. Preliminary data shows a rather fluctuating course of the disease from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to maternal death. However, it is not clear whether the disease increases the risk of pregnancy-related complications. The aim of the study is to describe the maternal and neonatal clinical characteristics and outcome of pregnancies with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: In this retrospective national-based study, we analyzed the medical records of all pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 and their neonates who were admitted to New-Jahra Hospital (NJH), Kuwait, between March 15th 2020 and May 31st 2020. During the study period and as part of the public health measures, a total of 185 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2, regardless of symptoms, were hospitalized at NJH, and were included. Maternal and neonatal clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and treatments were collected. The outcomes of pregnancies included miscarriage, intrauterine fetal death (IUFD), preterm birth and live birth were assessed until the end date of the outcomes follow-up (November 10th 2020). RESULTS: A total of 185 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled with a median age of 31 years (interquartile range, IQR: 27.5-34), and median gestational age at diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 infection was 29 weeks (IQR: 18-34). The majority (88%) of these women had mild symptoms, with fever (58%) being the most common presenting symptom followed by cough (50.6%). At the time of the analysis, out of the 185, 3 (1.6%) of the pregnant women had a miscarriage, 1 (0.54%) had IUFD which was not related to COVID-19, 16 (8.6%) had ongoing pregnancies and 165 (89%) had a live birth. Only 2 (1.1%) of these women developed severe pneumonia and required intensive care. A total of 167 neonates with two sets of twins were born with median gestational age at birth was 38 (IQR: 36-39) weeks. Most of the neonates were asymptomatic, and only 2 of them tested positive on day 5 by nasopharyngeal swab testing. CONCLUSIONS: In this national-based study, most of the pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed mild symptoms. Although mother-to-child vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible, COVID-19 infection during pregnancy may not lead to unfavorable maternal and neonatal outcomes.","Ayed, Amal; Embaireeg, Alia; Benawadh, Asmaa; Al-Fouzan, Wadha; Hammoud, Majdeda; Al-Hathal, Monif; Alzaydai, Abeer; Ahmad, Ashraf; Ayed, Mariam",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,404

This study aimed to determine the ongoing trend and upcoming infection status of COVID-19 in county levels of Texas. METHODS: Data were extracted from the following sources: published literature, surveillance, unpublished reports, and websites of Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), Natality report of Texas, and WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard. The 4-compartment Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removal (SEIR) mathematical model was used to estimate the current trend and future prediction of basic reproduction number and infection cases in Texas. Because the basic reproduction number is not sufficient to predict the outbreak, we applied the Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model to calculate the probability of the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: The estimated mean basic reproduction number of COVID-19 in Texas is predicted to be 2.65 by January 31, 2021. Our model indicated that the third wave might occur at the beginning of May 2021, which will peak at the end of June 2021. This prediction may come true if the current spreading situation/level persists, i.e., no clinically effective vaccine is available, or this vaccination program fails for some reason in this area. CONCLUSION: Our analysis indicates an alarming ongoing and upcoming infection rate of COVID-19 at county levels in Texas, thereby emphasizing the promotion of more coordinated and disciplined actions by policy-makers and the population to contain its devastating impact.","Hassan, Md Nazmul; Mahmud, Md Shahriar; Nipa, Kaniz Fatema; Kamrujjaman, Md",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,404
376391,The COVID-19 Pandemic and Relationship Banking in Germany: Will Regional Banks Cushion an Economic Decline or is A Banking Crisis Looming?,2020,"Persons with disabilities (PwDs) are less likely to access health care facilities, education, and employment in their dayto-day life. They are more likely to experience higher rates of neglect and abuse. The present COVID-19 pandemic situation has further affected the PwDs in terms of physical and social neglect. Moreover, the concept of social distancing, using a face mask, and following cough hygiene, which is fundamental in controlling the spread of COVID 19, is likely to be followed by the person with an intellectual impairment since they are highly dependent on their caretakers for their day to day activities. This scenario is even worse with PwDs who are living in congregate settings like residential camps, nursing facilities, and psychiatric institutions where infectivity is very higher. Thus a pronged approach is needed to assure that PwDs are not left behind during the times of pandemic. This paper argues that PwDs, because of their increased risk for exposure to COVID-19 and its consequences of developing morbidity and even possible deaths, should be prioritized in vaccination strategies. Otherwise, they will be left behind, experiencing disproportionate loss of lives and livelihoods, inaccessible health care services, and disconnection from society.","Boratne, A.

METHODS: The currently available literature was reviewed for microbiologically confirmed infections by 2019-nCoV or COVID-19 at the time of writing (13 February 2020). A literature search was performed using the PubMed database and Cochrane Library. Search terms included 'novel coronavirus' or '2019-nCoV' or 'COVID-19'. RESULTS: Published cases occurred mostly in males (age range, 8-92 years). Cardiovascular, digestive and endocrine system diseases were commonly reported, except previous chronic pulmonary diseases [e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiectasis] that were surprisingly underreported. Fever was present in all of the case series available, flanked by cough, dyspnoea, myalgia and fatigue. Multiple bilateral lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral ground-glass opacities were the main reported radiological features of 2019-nCoV infection, at least in the early phases of the disease. CONCLUSION: The new 2019-nCoV epidemic is mainly associated with respiratory disease and few extrapulmonary signs.

As of 30th June 2020, over 6,190 cases had been reported with a case fatality of 3.2%. Previous Coronavirus outbreaks have been associated with a significant burden of Cardiovascular disease. For COVID-19, however, there has been no direct reference to potential long-term cardiovascular effects, especially in Africa where atherosclerotic diseases are an emerging challenge. This article, therefore, aims at describing possible long-term effects on the burden of atherosclerotic disease among Kenyans. Available data indicate that COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease share pathomechanisms and risk factors which include ACE2 receptor invasion and renin-angiotensin system signaling, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. Further, SAR-COV-2 infection causes dyslipidemia, dysglycemia, kidney, and liver disease. These mechanisms and diseases constitute risk factors for the initiation, progression, and complications of atherosclerosis. In Kenya, the common risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and COVID-19 comprising Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, Obesity, Cigarette Smoking, Respiratory Tract Infections, Pulmonary Thromboembolism, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, and Renal disease are not uncommon and continue to increase. In essence, the prevalence of the common risk factors/comorbidities, between COVID-19 and CVD occurrence of ACE2 receptors on the endothelium, and hence pathomechanisms of SARS-COV-2 infection imply that COVID-19 may increase the burden of atherosclerotic disease in Kenya. All due care should be taken, to prevent and effectively manage the disease, to avert an imminent epidemic of atherosclerotic disease.","Ogeng039,; o, Julius; Karau, Paul Bundi; Misiani, Musa; Cheruiyot, Isaac; Olabu, Beda; Kariuki, Brian Ngure",Pan Afr Med J,,404

385600,Resolviendo Una De Las Piezas Del Puzle: Covid-19 Y Diabetes Tipo 2./ [solving One of the Pieces of the Puzzle: Covid-19 and Type 2 Diabetes],2020,"Aim: To assess the hypothesis that coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and S. aureus exacerbates morbidity and mortality among patients, the study aims to report the pooled burden of S. aureus co-infections in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods: We searched electronic databases and the bibliographies of pertinent papers for articles. We considered studies in which the core result was the number of patients with bacterial (S. aureus) co-infection. We performed random effects meta-analysis (REM) because the studies included were sampled from a universe of different populations and high heterogeneity was anticipated. Using the Cochran's Q statistic, the observed dispersion (heterogeneity) among effect sizes was assessed. The percentage of total variability in the estimates of the effect size was calculated with the I2 index. To check for publication bias, the Egger weighted regression, Begg rank correlation and meta-funnel plot were used. We conducted meta-regression analysis to evaluate the variability between our outcomes and the covariates using computational options such as ""methods of moments"" and then ""maximum likelihood"" ratio. Results: We included 18 studies and retrieved data for 63,370 patients hospitalized with influenza-like illness, of which about 14,369 (22.67%) tested positive for COVID-19 by rRT-PCR. Of this number, 8,249 (57.4%) patient samples were analyzed. Bacterial, fungal and viral agents were detected in 3,038 (36.8%); S. aureus in 1,192 (39.2%). Five studies reported MRSA co-infection. Study quality ranged from 6 to 9 (median 7.1) on a JBI scale. From the meta-analysis, 33.1% patients were found to be coinfected (95%, CI 18.0 to 52.6%, Q=3473: df=17, I2=99·48%, p=0.00). The rate of S. aureus /COVID-19 co-infection was 25.6% (95% CI: 15.6 to 39.0, Q=783.4, df=17, I2=97.702%, p=0.003).The proportion of COVID-19/S. aureus co-infected patients with MRSA was 53.9% (95% CI, 24.5 to 80.9, n=66, 5 studies, Q=29.32, df=4, I2=86.369%, p=0.000). With the multivariate meta-regression model, study type (p=0.029), quality (p=0.000) and country (p=0.000) were significantly associated with heterogeneity. Conclusions: The pooled rates of S. aureus among COVID-19 patients documented in this study support the concern of clinicians about the presence of S. aureus in co-infections. Improved antibiotic stewardship can be accomplished through rapid diagnosis by longitudinal sampling of patients.","Adeiza, Suleiman Shuaibu; Shuaibu, Abdulmalik Bello; Shuaibu, Gazali Mohammed",GMS Hyg Infect Control,,404
385685,From Bad to Worse: The Impact of COVID-19 on Commercial Fisheries Workers,2020,"Many people in developing and impoverished countries are not aware of diseases. They are not concerned about diseases as well as the treatment also. If a person does not treat his/her disease in the early period of time, the disease may turn into a worse scenario. Hence, this is very important to make them conscious. For this reason, an android application is developed and this application can be used to make them aware since android mobile phone has become very popular, affordable, and available nowadays. In the newly developed android application, some of the most common diseases in the developing countries are selected. The developed android app was automated and a person could easily find out if he/she has any of these disease probability. From the results, it is found that cholera, diarrhea, chikungunya, tuberculosis (TB), dengue, and lastly COVID-19 are the most frequent diseases in poor countries and therefore it has been included in the developed android application. Furthermore, the developed android applications has the ability to find out the probability to get affected by a disease. Checking out the disease probability, people would increase the concern about that disease and consult with a doctor at the early stage of that disease. © 2021 IEEE.","Mahmud, T.; Monirujjaman Khan, M.","5th International Conference on Computing Methodologies and Communication, ICCMC 2021",,404

Understanding the underlying mechanisms and developing innovative treatments are extremely urgent. G-quadruplexes (G4s) are important noncanonical nucleic acid structures with distinct biofunctions. Four putative G4-forming sequences (PQSs) in the SARS-CoV-2 genome were studied. One of them (RG-1), which locates in the coding sequence region of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), has been verified to form a stable RNA G4 structure in live cells. G4-specific compounds, such as PDP (pyridostatin derivative), can stabilize RG-1 G4 and significantly reduce the protein levels of SARS-CoV-2 N by inhibiting its translation both in vitro and in vivo. This result is the first evidence that PQSs in SARS-CoV-2 can form G4 structures in live cells, and that their biofunctions can be regulated by a G4-specific stabilizer. This finding will provide new insights into developing novel antiviral drugs against COVID-19.","Zhao, Chuanqi; Qin, Geng; Niu, Jingsheng; Wang, Zhao; Wang, Chunyu; Ren, Jinsong; Qu, Xiaogang",Angew. chem; int. ed. engl,,404
388612,Gender and medical education authorship: Moving forward comfortably with necessary conversations,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic agent capable of infecting humans and a wide range of animal species. Over the duration of the pandemic, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S) have arisen in circulating viral populations, culminating in the spread of several variants of concern (VOC) with varying degrees of altered virulence, transmissibility, and neutralizing antibody escape. In this study, we employed lentivirus-based pseudotyped viruses that express specific SARS-CoV-2 S protein substitutions and cell lines that stably express ACE2 from nine different animal species to gain insights into the effects of VOC mutations on viral entry and antibody neutralization capability. All animal ACE2 receptors tested, except mink, support viral cell entry for pseudoviruses expressing the parental (prototype Wuhan-1) S at levels comparable to human ACE2. Most single S substitutions (e.g., 452R, 478K, 501Y) did not significantly change virus entry, although 614G and 484K resulted in a decreased efficiency in viral entry. Conversely, combinatorial VOC substitutions in the S protein were associated with significantly increased entry capacity of pseudotyped viruses compared to that of the parental Wuhan-1 pseudotyped virus. Similarly, infection studies using live ancestral (USA-WA1/2020), Alpha, and Beta SARS-CoV-2 viruses in hamsters revealed a higher replication potential for the Beta variant compared to the ancestral prototype virus. Moreover, neutralizing titers in sera from various animal species, including humans, were significantly reduced by single substitutions of 484K or 452R, double substitutions of 501Y-484K, 452R-484K and 452R-478K and the triple substitution of 501Y-484K-417N, suggesting that 484K and 452R are particularly important for evading neutralizing antibodies in human, cat, and rabbit sera. Cumulatively, this study reveals important insights into the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and the effect of recently emergent S protein substitutions on viral entry, virus replication and antibody-mediated viral neutralization. Author summaryCells stably expressing ACE2 from various animals and a lentivirus-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus assay were established to study SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. The results demonstrated that ACE2 from a wide range of animal species facilitate S-mediated virus entry into cells, which is supported by in silico data as well as natural and experimental infection studies. Pseudotyped viruses containing mutations in the RBD of S representative of the Alpha, Gamma, and especially Beta, variants of concern demonstrated that certain mutations are associated with increased viral entry compared to the parental S. The Beta variant was also observed to have a replicative advantage in vitro and in vivo compared to the prototype virus. Pseudotyped viruses containing combinatorial substitutions of 501Y-484K-417K, 614G-501Y-484K and 614G-501Y-484K-417N increased viral entry via ACE2 across multiple species. The 501Y or 478K single substitution did not significantly affect neutralizing capacity of immune sera compared to the prototype strain, but the addition of 484K or 452R substitutions significantly reduced the neutralizing titers.","Kim, Yunjeong; Gaudreault, Natasha N; Meekins, David A; Perera, Krishani D; Bold, Dashzeveg; Trujillo, Jessie D; Morozov, Igor; McDowell, Chester D; Chang, Kyeong-Ok; Richt, Juergen A.",,,404
388613,Gender and medical education authorship: Moving forward comfortably with necessary conversations,2021,"BACKGROUND: Neurological manifestations are common in patients with COVID-19, but little is known about pathophysiological mechanisms. In this single-center study, we describe neurological manifestations of 58 patients, regarding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and neuroimaging findings. METHODS: 58 COVID-19 patients with neurologic manifestations and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR screening on CSF analysis were included. Clinical, laboratory, and brain MRI data were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Patients were mostly men (66%) with a median age of 62 years. Encephalopathy was frequent (81%), followed by a pyramidal dysfunction (16%), seizures (10%), and headaches (5%). Protein and albumin levels in CSF were increased in 38% and 23%, respectively. A total of 40% of patients displayed an elevated albumin quotient suggesting impaired blood-brain barrier integrity. CSF-specific IgG oligoclonal band was found in five (11%) cases, suggesting an intrathecal synthesis of IgG, and 26 (55%) patients presented identical oligoclonal bands in serum and CSF. Four (7%) patients harbored a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in CSF. Regarding brain MRI, 20 (38%) patients presented leptomeningeal enhancement. CONCLUSIONS: Brain MRI abnormalities, especially leptomeningeal enhancement, and increased inflammatory markers in CSF are frequent in patients with neurological manifestations related to COVID-19, whereas SARS-CoV 2 detection in CSF remained scanty.","Lersy, François; Benotmane, Ilies; Helms, Julie; Collange, Olivier; Schenck, Maleka; Brisset, Jean-Christophe; Chammas, Agathe; Willaume, Thibault; Lefebvre, Nicolas; Solis, Morgane; Hansmann, Yves; Fabacher, Thibaut; Caillard, Sophie; Mertes, Paul Michel; Pottecher, Julien; Schneider, Francis; Meziani, Ferhat; Fafi-Kremer, Samira; Kremer, Stéphane",J. infect. dis,,404

Authors' reply,2020,"It is important to think about the eventual application of a COVID-19 vaccination certificate as an eligibility criterion to carry out certain activities and to discuss in advance the problems that the use of this tool may pose in legal terms. To this end, we must begin by stating the assumptions that would be necessary to justify its implantation, including scientific consensus on the scope of the immunity granted by COVID-19 vaccines, especially in blocking transmission in the community. Likewise, it emphasizes the importance of broadening the view in the sense of internalizing that the passport or vaccination pass constitutes only one of the many options within a rich catalog of possibilities when it comes to reinforcing the recommended vaccination model through incentives adopted in the Vaccination Strategy against COVID-19, including the use of nudging. In any case, if conditionality is installed and expanded to the extent of significantly influencing daily life, it could lead to a kind of indirect obligation, with the risk of dysfunctions in terms of equality and systemic coherence if the public powers do not contribute to clearly define the legal limits beforehand and to drive a process that in itself could be dispersed and disorderly.","Seira, César Cierco",Vacunas (Madrid),,404

Quantum Odyssey is a new piece of computer software that promises to be a medium where people can learn quantum computing without any previous requirements. It aims to achieve this through visual cues and puzzle play, without requiring the user to possess a background in computer coding or even linear algebra, which are traditionally a must to work on quantum algorithms. In this paper we report our findings on an UKRI Citizen Science grant that involves using Quantum Odyssey to teach how to construct quantum computing algorithms. Sessions involved 30 minutes of play, with 10 groups of 5 students, ranging between 11 to 18 years old, in two schools in the UK. Results show the Quantum Odyssey visual methods are efficient in portraying counterintuitive quantum computational logic in a visual and interactive form. This enabled untrained participants to quickly grasp difficult concepts in an intuitive way and solve problems that are traditionally given today in Masters level courses in a mathematical form. The results also show an increased interest in quantum physics after play, a higher openness and curiosity to learn the mathematics behind computing on quantum systems. Participants developed a visual, rather than mathematical intuition, that enabled them to understand and correctly answer entry level technical quantum information science.","Nita, Laurentiu; Chancellor, Nicholas; Smith, Laura Mazzoli; Cramman, Helen; Dost, Gulsah",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07077v1.pdf,404

Despite new guidelines being published recently, a number of important questions remained unanswered including the role of taxis, as initial non-operative management. This is particularly relevant now due to the possibility of a lack of immediate surgical care as a result of COVID-19. The aim of this review is to assess the role of taxis in the management of emergency inguinal hernias. METHODS: A review of the literature was undertaken. Available literature published until March 2019 was obtained and reviewed. 32,021 papers were identified, only 9 were of sufficient value to be used. RESULTS: There was a large discrepancy in the terminology of incarcerated/strangulated used. Taxis can be safely attempted early after the onset of symptoms and is effective in about 70% of patients. The possibility of reduction en-mass should be kept in mind. Definitive surgery to repair the hernia can be delayed by weeks until such time as surgery can be safely arranged. CONCLUSIONS: The use of taxis in emergency inguinal hernia is a useful first line of treatment in areas or situations where surgical care is not immediately available, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Emergency surgery remains the mainstay of management in the strangulated hernia setting.","East, B; Pawlak, M; de Beaux, A C",Hernia,,404

PICO™, a no canister single-use system offers a lightweight, portable alternative to traditional negative pressure wound therapy, with improved clinical performance. The aim of this study was to determine the potential mechanism(s) of action of single-use negative pressure wound therapy versus traditional negative pressure wound therapy. Approach: Single-use negative pressure wound therapy and traditional negative pressure wound therapy were applied to an in vivo porcine excisional wound model, following product use guidelines. Macroscopic, histological and biochemical analyses were performed at defined healing time-points to assess multiple aspects of the healing response. Results: Wounds treated with single-use negative pressure displayed greater wound closure and increased re-epithelialisation versus those treated with traditional negative pressure. The resulting granulation tissue was more advanced with fewer neutrophils, reduced inflammatory markers, more mature collagen and no wound filler-associated foreign body reactions. Of note, single-use negative pressure therapy failed to induce wound edge epithelial hyperproliferation, while traditional negative pressure therapy compromised peri-wound skin, which remained inflamed with high transepidermal water loss; features not observed following single-use treatment. Innovation: Single-use negative pressure was identified to improve multiple aspects of healing versus traditional negative pressure treatment. Conclusion: This study provides important new insight into the differing mode of action of single-use versus traditional negative pressure and may go some way to explaining the improved clinical outcomes observed with single use negative pressure therapy.","Brownhill, Varuni R; Huddleston, Elizabeth; Bell, Andrea; Hart, Jeffrey; Webster, Iain; Hardman, Matthew; Wilkinson, Holly Nicola",,,404

This prospective follow-up cohort study included 94 patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a medical ward at the Montichiari Hospital, Brescia, Italy from February 28th to April 30th, 2020. Patients had COVID-19 related pneumonia with respiratory failure. Ninety-four patients out of 193 survivors accepted to be re-evaluated after discharge, on average after 4 months. In » of the patients an evidence of pulmonary fibrosis was detected, as indicated by an altered diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO); in 6-7% of patients the alteration was classified as of moderate/severe degree. We also evaluated quality of life thorough a structured questionnaire: 52% of the patients still lamented fatigue, 36% effort dyspnea, 10% anorexia, 14% dysgeusia or anosmia, 31% insomnia and 21% anxiety. Finally, we evaluated three prognostic indices (the Brixia radiologic score, the Charlson Comorbidity Index and the 4C mortality score) in terms of prediction of the clinical consequences of the disease. All of them significantly predicted the extent of short-term lung involvement. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia is associated to relevant short-term clinical consequences, both in terms of persistence of symptoms and in terms of impairment of DLCO (indicator of a possible development of pulmonary fibrosis); some severity indices of the disease may predict short-term clinical outcome. Further studies are needed to ascertain whether such manifestations may persist long-term.","Boari, Gianluca E M; Bonetti, Silvia; Braglia-Orlandini, Federico; Chiarini, Giulia; Faustini, Cristina; Bianco, Gianluca; Santagiuliana, Marzia; Guarinoni, Vittoria; Saottini, Michele; Viola, Sara; Ferrari-Toninelli, Giulia; Pasini, Giancarlo; Bonzi, Bianca; Desenzani, Paolo; Tusi, Claudia; Malerba, Paolo; Zanotti, Eros; Turini, Daniele; Rizzoni, Damiano",High blood pressure &amp; cardiovascular prevention (Online),,404

Internet-based interventions may however exclude some individuals and be a threat to the therapeutic relationship between patient and practitioner. (3) Successful roll-out of Internet-based interventions would be facilitated by a strong empirical- or practice-based evidence, a national coordinated approach and timely training and supervision. Barriers to the roll-out include digital intervention set-up costs and delays due to NHS inflexibility. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights factors influencing access to Internet-based therapies, important given the rapid evolution of e-therapies, and particularly timely given increasing use of remote therapies due to COVID-19 restrictions. Interviewees were open to Internet-based approaches, particularly GSH interventions, so long as they do not compromise on therapy quality. Interviewees acknowledged implementation may be challenging, and recommendations were offered. PRACTITIONER POINTS: There is a shift in practice and increasingly positive views from NHS staff around remote psychological therapies and different ways of connecting with patients, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a strong preference for Internet-based psychological interventions that are guided and that include built-in outcome measures co-produced with service users. There is a need to raise awareness of the growing evidence base for Internet-based psychological therapies, including research examining therapeutic alliance across Internet-based and face-to-face therapies. Challenges implementing Internet-based psychological therapies include therapist resistance to changing working practices in general, and inflexibility of the NHS, and national, coordinated implementation efforts are encouraged.","Simon, Natalie; Ploszajski, Matt; Lewis, Catrin; Smallman, Kim; Roberts, Neil P; Kitchiner, Neil J; Brookes-Howell, Lucy; Bisson, Jonathan I",Psychol. psychother,,404
406344,Gastroenterological considerations in the framework of the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The initial response to COVID-19 in the UK involved a rapid contraction of face-to-face sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services and widespread use of remote workarounds. This study sought to illuminate young people's experiences of accessing and using condoms and contraception in the early months of the pandemic. METHODS: We analysed data, including open-text responses, from an online survey conducted in June-July 2020 with a convenience sample of 2005 16-24-year-olds living in Scotland. RESULTS: Among those who used condoms and contraception, one quarter reported that COVID-19 mitigation measures had made a difference to their access or use. Open-text responses revealed a landscape of disrupted prevention, including changes to sexual risk-taking and preventive practices, unwanted contraceptive pathways, unmet need for sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing, and switches from freely provided to commercially sold condoms and contraception. Pandemic-related barriers to accessing free condoms and contraception included: (1) uncertainty about the legitimacy of accessing SRH care and self-censorship of need; (2) confusion about differences between SRH care and advice received from healthcare professionals during the pandemic compared with routine practice; and (3) exacerbation of existing access barriers, alongside reduced social support and resources to navigate SRH care. CONCLUSIONS: Emerging barriers to STI and pregnancy prevention within the context of COVID-19 have the potential to undermine positive SRH practices, and widen inequalities, among young people. As SRH services are restored amid evolving pandemic restrictions, messaging to support navigation of condom and contraception services should be co-created with young people.","Lewis, Ruth; Blake, Carolyn; Shimonovich, Michal; Coia, Nicky; Duffy, Johann; Kerr, Yvonne; Wilson, Jill; Graham, Cynthia Ann; Mitchell, Kirstin R",BMJ sex. reprod. health (Online),,404
407674,From top scientist to science media star during COVID-19 – South Africa's Salim Abdool Karim,2020,"INTRODUCTION: There is a need to identify effective, safe treatments for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) rapidly, given the current, ongoing pandemic. A systematic benefit-risk assessment was designed and conducted to examine the benefit-risk profile of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients compared with standard of care, placebo or other treatments. A key objective of this study was to provide a platform for a dynamic systematic benefit-risk evaluation, which starts with inevitably limited information (to meet the urgent unmet public health need worldwide), then update the benefit-risk evaluation as more data become available. METHODS: The Benefit-Risk Action Team (BRAT) framework was used to assess the overall benefit-risk of the use of remdesivir as a treatment for COVID-19 compared with standard of care, placebo or other treatments. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar and government agency websites to identify literature reporting clinical outcomes in patients taking remdesivir for COVID-19. A value tree was constructed and key benefits and risks were ranked by two clinicians in order of considered importance. RESULTS: Using the BRAT method, several key benefits and risks for use of remdesivir in COVID-19 compared with placebo have been identified. In one trial, the benefit of time to clinical improvement was not statistically significant (21 vs 23 days, HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.87-1.75), although the study was underpowered. In another trial, a shorter time to recovery in patients treated with remdesivir was observed (11 vs 15 days), with non-significant reduced mortality risk (8% vs 12%). Risk data were only available from one trial. This trial reported fewer serious adverse events in patients taking remdesivir (18%) compared with the placebo group (26%); however, more patients in the remdesivir group discontinued treatment as a result of an adverse event compared with those patients receiving placebo (12% vs 5%). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary clinical trial results suggest that there may be a favourable benefit-risk profile for remdesivir compared with placebo in severe COVID-19 infection and further data on benefits would strengthen this evaluation. There is limited safety data for remdesivir, which should be obtained in further studies. The current framework summarises the key anticipated benefits and risks for which further data are needed. Ongoing clinical trial data can be incorporated into the framework when available to provide an updated benefit-risk assessment.","Davies, Miranda; Osborne, Vicki; Lane, Samantha; Roy, Debabrata; Dhanda, Sandeep; Evans, Alison; Shakir, Saad",Drug Saf,,404
408290,COVID-19 and vitamin D. Position paper of the Spanish Society for Bone Research and Mineral Metabolism (SEIOMM),2020,"Effective delivery of cancer care via telehealth requires a planned care system that accounts for myriad patient, provider, and practice/cancer center resources before, during, and after the care episode. Telehealth is broadly defined as a method to have virtual, bidirectional communication between patients and providers. Telehealth can include methods such as audio-only, video-consultation, and tele-monitoring, which can occur in a synchronous, asynchronous, or blended format. The purpose of this review is to present common foundational principles for providing clinical cancer care via telehealth, followed by an overview of three distinct examples of comprehensive telehealth programs that have been developed to meet the needs of patients and families across the cancer trajectory, including survivorship, rehabilitation, and palliative care phases. The programs described are exemplars that were developed and implemented prior to the coronavirus pandemic, so they reflect many years of planning and evidence. Lessons learned include the need for ongoing patient support, clinician training, and cancer health system/practice programmatic considerations such as billing, scheduling, reimbursement, software, and hardware/platform security. Although the COVID-19 pandemic produced an explosive shift in regulations and implementation, sustainability of these changes may not be long-term. Nevertheless, a permanent shift in cancer care to include telehealth is likely here to stay.","Bakitas, Marie; Cheville, Andrea L; Mulvey, Therese Marie; Peppercorn, Jeffrey; Watts, Kristen; Dionne-Odom, J Nicholas",Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,,404

However, since March 2020, it has been most common to see drawn, designed, or interpreted images in three dimensions, sometimes even representing different or directly invented viruses. This analysis studies a sample of images supposedly of SARS-CoV-2 that appeared at the beginning of this pandemic on the internet. Fake images or imaginary illustrations of the Covid-19 coronavirus predominate in all sources of information examined, except for those documented in encyclopedias or scientific articles. Rather than real images, the media have used more fake images of the coronavirus, often from repositories or paid stocks, usually freely available. When presenting SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus content, the use of fake, unrealistic, esthetically retouched illustrations is more common than actual or scientific photographs of the virus. The reference image used in the media and other information sources of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 is a retouched three-dimensional, color design image for illustration rather than an actual image. The original, real images of the coronavirus did not have the expected informative presence in an emergency situation. The use of unrealistic images of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus seems to be a manifestation of a low-intensity infodemic. However, information professionals must use rigorous images to support their information, also in the case of the Covid-19.","Andreu-Sánchez, Celia; Martín-Pascual, Miguel-Ángel",Prof. Inf.,,404
417244,Does COVID-19 cause axonal GBS?,2020,"ABSTRACT: The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is impacting post-acute inpatient rehabilitation nursing practice from preadmission assessment to inpatient care delivery and transition planning. Patients with disability following COVID-19 require interventions to address respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, musculoskeletal, and psychosocial issues. The pandemic has resulted in changes to program structures and how inpatient rehabilitation facilities approach family caregiver engagement amidst visitation restrictions. Technology solutions can be utilized to reduce the patient and their family's feelings of isolation and support caregiver preparation for discharge. Nurse leaders are essential in supporting staff during this crisis through authentic presence and providing resources and training. Rehabilitation nurses are key in helping patients and families manage rehabilitation and the aftermath of COVID-19 to restore optimal functioning. In this clinical consultation, we synthesize insights learned from the COVID-19 responses at three inpatient rehabilitation facilities. We describe the impact of rehabilitation nursing interventions to improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19 and their caregivers.","Camicia, Michelle E; Cournan, Michele C; Rye, Jill",Rehabil. nurs,,404

417421,Health and nutrition of India's labour force and COVID-19 challenges,2020,"The SARS-Cov-2 pandemic in 2020 has caused oncology teams around the world to adapt their practice in the aim of protecting patients. Early evidence from China indicated that patients with cancer, and particularly those who had recently received chemotherapy or surgery, were at increased risk of adverse outcomes following SARS-Cov-2 infection. Many registries of cancer patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 emerged during the first wave. We collate the evidence from these national and international studies and focus on the risk factors for patients with solid cancers and the contribution of systemic anti-cancer treatments (SACT-chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted and hormone therapy) to outcomes following SARS-Cov-2 infection. Patients with cancer infected with SARS-Cov-2 have a higher probability of death compared with patients without cancer. Common risk factors for mortality following COVID-19 include age, male sex, smoking history, number of comorbidities and poor performance status. Oncological features that may predict for worse outcomes include tumour stage, disease trajectory and lung cancer. Most studies did not identify an association between SACT and adverse outcomes. Recent data suggest that the timing of receipt of SACT may be associated with risk of mortality. Ongoing recruitment to these registries will enable us to provide evidence-based care.","Lee, Alvin J X; Purshouse, Karin",Br J Cancer,,404

Nearly half of all submissions in 2019 were rejected before peer-review or transferred to other Springer Nature journals. The published articles were contributed from 34 different countries, with authors from China, the USA, and Brazil among the top three contributors. An enhanced editorial oversight allowed peer-reviewers to focus on fewer articles that were well-matched to their expertise, which led to lower rejection rates post-peer-review.

419288,An alternate to survey methods to measure work from home,2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes pulmonary injury or multiple-organ injury by various pathological pathways. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-ß) is a key factor that is released during SARS-CoV-2 infection. TGF-ß, by internalization of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), suppresses the anti-oxidant system, downregulates the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and activates the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and nuclear factor-kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB). These changes cause inflammation and lung injury along with coagulopathy. Moreover, reactive oxygen species play a significant role in lung injury, which levels up during SARS-CoV-2 infection. DRUG SUGGESTION: Pirfenidone is an anti-fibrotic drug with an anti-oxidant activity that can prevent lung injury during SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking the maturation process of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-ß) and enhancing the protective role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Pirfenidone is a safe drug for patients with hypertension or diabetes and its side effect tolerated well. CONCLUSION: The drug as a theoretical perspective may be an effective and safe choice for suppressing the inflammatory response during COVID-19. The recommendation would be a combination of pirfenidone and N-acetylcysteine to achieve maximum benefit during SARS-CoV-2 treatment.","Hamidi, Seyed Hootan; Kadamboor Veethil, Sandhya; Hamidi, Seyedeh Harir",Pharmacol Rep,,404

These optimal interventions allow policymakers to manage NPIs to minimize the epidemiological and human health impacts of both COVID-19 and the intervention itself. Here, we use a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) mathematical model to explore the feasibility of optimizing the duration, magnitude and trigger point of five different NPI scenarios to minimize the peak prevalence or the attack rate of a simulated UK COVID-19 outbreak. An optimal parameter space to minimize the peak prevalence or the attack rate was identified for each intervention scenario, with each scenario differing with regard to how reductions to transmission were modelled. However, we show that these optimal interventions are fragile, sensitive to epidemiological uncertainty and prone to implementation error. We highlight the use of robust, but suboptimal interventions as an alternative, with these interventions capable of mitigating the peak prevalence or the attack rate over a broader, more achievable parameter space, but being less efficacious than theoretically optimal interventions. This work provides an illustrative example of the concept of intervention optimization across a range of different NPI strategies.

427698,French Sarcoma Group proposals for management of sarcoma patients during the COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"BACKGROUND: Due to COVID-19 and high demand for respirators, some healthcare professionals have been using the Halyard H600 fabric as an alternative to N95 respirators without testing the filtration efficiency of the fabric with established scientific methods. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficiency of the Halyard H600 as a respirator filtering material as compared to the NIOSH-certified N95 and P100 filters, and determine if H600 is a good alternative for respiratory protection for healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Three filter types (Halyard H600, N95, and P100) were challenged with salt particles inside an exposure chamber at a flow rate of 43 LPM and relative humidity of 40 ± 2%. N95 and P100 respirator filters were tested initially to establish the validity of the chamber, followed by the Halyard H600 fabric. Particle penetration was measured using an aerosol spectrometer. The filtration efficiency was calculated for different particle sizes by measuring the particle number concentration upstream and downstream of the filter. The pressure drop across the filter materials was measured using a manometer. RESULTS: The efficiency of the P100 for particles &#8805;250 nm was 100%. The N95 efficiency was 97 ± 1% at 275 nm, 99 ± 0% at 324 nm, and 100% for larger particles. The Halyard H600 fabric had a variable efficiency with an average of 62 ± 28% at 275 nm, 89 ± 8% at 324 nm, and 100% efficiency for particles >450 nm. The pressure drop values for P100 and N95 were 32 and 8 mmH2O, respectively. The Halyard H600 fabric resistance increased dramatically from 30 mmH2O at the start of the exposure to 65 mmH2O after 16-minutes of exposure. CONCLUSION: The high variability in filter efficiency for particles &#8804;324 nm and the increased fabric breathing resistance demonstrate that the Halyard H600 has an inferior performance and is not a good substitute for N95 and P100. Thus, the use of the Halyard H600 fabric for respiratory protection is not recommended.","Sousan, Sinan; Garcia, Nicole; White, Avian; Balanay, Jo Anne",Am J Infect Control,,404

At least now they have a reason: Work, control and values in teachers' work",2021,"Device-related pressure injury (DRPI) is a serious problem that is affecting professionals working on the front lines against COVID-19 due to the prolonged use of personal protective equipment (PPE). In addition to the physical and psychological integrity of professionals, these injuries can compromise the quality of care. Therefore, using technologies to prevent this adverse effect is an urgent matter. This is a parallel two-arm randomized clinical trial without the use of a control group to compare the use of foam and extra-thin hydrocolloid in preventing DRPI associated with the use of PPE by health professionals working on the front lines against coronavirus. In total, 88 professionals were divided into two groups: foam and hydrocolloid. Data were collected using two instruments and related to demographic and professional characteristics and skin evaluation. Each volunteer received one of the dressings, both with the same dimensions and arranged over similar regions, and data were gathered at baseline and after 6 or 12 hours. Descriptive and inferential analytic statistical methods were used; the significance level adopted was 5%. No participant developed DRPI, but four areas with hyperemia were observed in the foam group (two in the forehead, one in the cheeks, and one in the nose bridge), as well as four areas with hyperemia in the hydrocolloid group (two in the nose bridge, one in the right ear, and one in the left ear). There was no difference between the groups regarding skin conditions and discomfort (P > .05). The average cost obtained was $ 5.8/person and $ 4.4/person in the foam group and the hydrocolloid group, respectively, considering the dressing measurements. The results show that foam and extra-thin hydrocolloid were effective in preventing DRPI associated with the use of PPE.","Gasparino, Renata Cristina; Lima, Maria Helena Melo; de Souza Oliveira-Kumakura, Ana Railka; da Silva, Vanessa Abreu; de Jesus Meszaros, Mariana; Antunes, Ivan Rogério",Wound repair regen,,404

Patterns of COVID-19-related preventive behaviors practiced by cancer survivors are unknown, including practices related to canceling doctor's appointments. We evaluated COVID-19-related preventive behaviors among cancer survivors in the United States. METHODS: We used nationally representative data of 10,760 U.S. adults from the COVID-19 Impact Survey. We defined cancer survivors as those with a self-reported diagnosis of cancer (n = 854, 7.6%). We present frequencies and &#967;2 tests to evaluate COVID-19-related preventive behaviors among cancer survivors. We estimated determinants of canceling doctor's appointments among cancer survivors using Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Cancer survivors were more likely to practice preventive behaviors, including social distancing (93%, &#967;2 P < 0.001), wearing a face mask (93%, &#967;2 P < 0.001), and avoiding crowded areas (84%, &#967;2 P < 0.001) compared with adults without cancer. Cancer survivors were more likely to cancel doctor's appointments (41%, &#967;2 P < 0.001), whereas they were less likely to cancel other social activities such as work (19%, &#967;2 P < 0.001) and school-related (13%, &#967;2 P < 0.001) activities. After adjustment for covariates, while non-Hispanic (NH)-Black cancer survivors were less likely to cancel a doctor's appointment compared with NH-White cancer survivors, cancer survivors aged 18 to 29, who were female, and who had least one comorbid condition were more likely. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer survivors are adhering to recommended preventive behaviors. Cancer survivor's continuity of care may be impacted by COVID-19, specifically young adults, females, and those with existing comorbid conditions. IMPACT: Insights into cancer survivors whose care may be most impacted by COVID-19 will be valuable toward surveillance and survivorship of U.S. cancer survivors.","Islam, Jessica Y; Camacho-Rivera, Marlene; Vidot, Denise C",Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,,404
438298,Reaching out to migrant households during COVID-19 outbreak: the increasing need of social workers in Cambodia,2020,"Vitamin D is associated with various diseases such as obesity, digestive problems, osteoporosis, depression, and infections, which has emerged as an interest in public healthcare. Recently, vitamin D has received more attention because of the potential implication with coronavirus disease 2019. In this study, we developed a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) aptasensor based on polyethylene-glycol(PEG)-free gold nanorods (AuNRs) for the wide-range and direct detection of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. The surfactant on AuNRs was removed by exchanging with polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) instead of PEG then the PSS was exchanged with citrate. By exchanging the stabilizer of AuNRs from PEG to PEG-free (i.e., citrate), the sensing efficiency of LSPR aptasensor was significantly improved. Additionally, LSPR aptasensor was functionalized with aptamer and blocking agent to enhance the sensing performance. The LSPR aptasensor achieved the direct, highly sensitive, and selective detection of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 over a wide concentration range (0.1-105 ng/mL), with a limit of detection of 0.1 ng/mL. This detection range included the concentration of vitamin D from deficiency to excess. The PEG-free AuNR-based LSPR aptasensor affords a new avenue for the development of robust sensing technology for vitamins.","Jo, Seongjae; Lee, Wonseok; Park, Joohyung; Park, Hyunjun; Kim, Minwoo; Kim, Woochang; Hong, Junghwa; Park, Jinsung",Biosens Bioelectron,,404
439387,New Settings in Anatomy and Surgery Teaching During the Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is higher than most other hospitalized patients. Nonadministration of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis is common and is associated with VTE events. Our objective was to determine whether nonadministration of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis is more common in patients with COVID-19 versus other hospitalized patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort analysis of all adult patients discharged from the Johns hopkins hospital between Mar 1 and May 12, 2020, we compared demographic, clinical characteristics, VTE outcomes, prescription and administration of VTE prophylaxis between COVID-19 positive, negative, and not tested groups. RESULTS: Patients tested positive for COVID-19 were significantly older, and more likely to be Hispanic, have a higher median body mass index, have longer hospital length of stay, require mechanical ventilation, develop pulmonary embolism and die (all p < 0.001). COVID-19 patients were more likely to be prescribed (aOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.38-1.66) and receive all doses of prescribed pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis (aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.36-1.62). The number of patients who missed at least one dose of VTE prophylaxis and developed VTE was similar between the three groups (p = 0.31). CONCLUSIONS: It is unlikely that high rates of VTE in COVID-19 are due to nonadministration of doses of pharmacologic prophylaxis. Hence, we should prioritize research into alternative approaches to optimizing VTE prevention in patients with COVID-19.","Varasteh Kia, Mujan; Lau, Brandyn D; Owodunni, Oluwafemi P; Kraus, Peggy S; Holzmueller, Christine G; Hobson, Deborah B; Shaffer, Dauryne L; Streiff, Michael B; Haut, Elliott R",J. thromb. thrombolysis,,404
439388,New Settings in Anatomy and Surgery Teaching During the Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"It is necessary to disinfect treated wastewater prior to discharge to reduce exposure risks to humans and the environment. The currently practiced wastewater disinfection technologies are challenged by toxic by-products, chemicals and energy demand, a range of effectiveness limitations, among other concerns. An effective, eco-friendly, and energy-efficient alternative disinfection technique is desirable to modernize and enhance wastewater treatment operations. Copper and nickel micro-structured metal foams, and a conventional copper mesh, were evaluated as disinfecting surfaces for treating secondary-treated wastewater contaminated with coliform bacteria. The micro-structured copper foam was adopted for scale-up study, due to its stable and satisfactory bactericidal performance obtained over a wide range of bacterial concentrations and metal-to-liquid ratios. Three scales of experiments, using two types of reactor designs, were performed using municipal wastewater to determine the optimal scale-up factors: small lab-scale batch reactor, intermediate lab-scale batch reactor, and pilot-scale continuous tubular reactor experiments. The performance was evaluated with the aim of minimizing metal material requirement with respect to bactericidal efficiency and leaching risks at all scales. Copper foam, at or above optimal conditions, consistently inactivated over 95 % of total coliforms, fecal coliforms and E.coli in wastewater at various scales, and leachate copper concentrations were determined to be below Canadian guideline values for outfall. This study successfully implemented the “structure” strategy of process intensification, and opens up the possibility to apply micro-structured copper foam in a range of other water disinfection systems, from pre-treatment to point-of-use, and should thus become a topic of further research.","Zhao, Jinghan; Yan, Peihua; Snow, Benjamin; Santos, Rafael M.; Chiang, Yi Wai",Process Saf.

Globally, it has been observed that according to the statistics, India has the second largest number of people with diabetes. Literature review has been implemented within the databases using suitable keywords. For persons suffering from diabetic disorder, the COVID-19 infection becomes a dual challenge. Diabetes is a severe metabolic situation which causes the sugar levels in the blood to increase than the normal level. Normally, communicable disease like COVID-19 is more prevailing in patients with diabetes. Diabetic patient has poor immune response to infections. The different bacterial, viral, parasitic, and mycotic infections showed increased probability in diabetic patients as compared to non-diabetic patient. All these conclusions clear out the intention that the diabetic patients are more susceptible to enhanced inflammatory response that may lead to rapid spreading of COVID-19 infection with high rate of mortality. In the present situation of pandemic, managing diabetes seems to be quite challenging and diabetic patient having COVID-19 infection should follow normal course of antihypertensive and antidiabetic drugs prescribed with the exception of sodium glucose co-transpoters-2 inhibitors which would increase the risk of dehydration and ketoacidosis.

However, to our knowledge, the consequences of mask wearing on communication between surgeons and patients have not been studied. Objective: To evaluate the effects of clear vs standard covered masks on communication during surgical clinic encounters. Design: This randomized clinical trial examined communication between surgeons and their patients when surgeons wore clear vs covered masks in surgical outpatient clinics at a single academic medical center. New patients were recruited from participating surgeons' clinic schedules. Interventions: Surgeons wore either clear masks or covered masks for each clinic visit with a new patient, based on a per-visit randomization plan. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measures included patient perceptions of (1) surgeon communication and (2) trust in surgeons, as well as (3) quantitative assessments and (4) qualitative assessments regarding patient impressions of the surgeon's mask. After the clinic encounter, patients completed a verbal survey including validated Clinician and Group Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems questions. Additional questions involved surgeon empathy, trust, and the patient's impression of the surgeon's mask. Data were analyzed by comparing patient data in the clear vs covered groups using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests, and comments were analyzed for themes. Results: Two hundred patients were enrolled from 15 surgeons' clinics spanning 7 subspecialties. When surgeons wore a clear mask, patients rated their surgeons higher for providing understandable explanations (clear, 95 of 100 [95%] vs covered, 78 of 100 [78%]; P < .001), demonstrating empathy (clear, 99 [99%] vs covered, 85 [85%]; P < .001), and building trust (clear, 94 [94%] vs covered, 72 [72%]; P < .001). Patients preferred clear masks (clear, 100 [100%] vs covered, 72 [72%]; P < .001), citing improved surgeon communication and appreciation for visualization of the face. Conversely, 8 of 15 surgeons (53%) were unlikely to choose the clear mask over their standard covered mask. Conclusions and Relevance: This randomized clinical trial demonstrates that patients prefer to see their surgeon's face. Surgeons who wore clear masks were perceived by patients to be better communicators, have more empathy, and elicit greater trust. Because masks will remain part of the health care landscape for some time, deliberate attention to preserving communication within the surgeon-patient relationship is warranted.

445197,COVID deaths in South Africa: 99 days since South Africa's first death,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is leading to social (physical) distancing policies worldwide, including in the USA. Some of the first actions taken by governments are the closing of schools. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce the number of cases and, ultimately, mortality comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the effect of school closure on the health-care labour force. The potential benefits from school closures need to be weighed against costs of health-care worker absenteeism associated with additional child-care obligations. In this study, we aimed to measure child-care obligations for US health-care workers arising from school closures when these are used as a social distancing measure. We then assessed how important the contribution of health-care workers would have to be in reducing mortality for their absenteeism due to child-care obligations to undo the benefits of school closures in reducing the number of cases. METHODS: For this modelling analysis, we used data from the monthly releases of the US Current Population Survey to characterise the family structure and probable within-household child-care options of US health-care workers. We accounted for the occupation within the health-care sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the health-care workforce that are most exposed to child-care obligations from school closures. We used these estimates to identify the critical level at which the importance of health-care labour supply in increasing the survival probability of a patient with COVID-19 would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. FINDINGS: Between January, 2018, and January, 2020, the US Current Population Survey included information on more than 3·1 million individuals across 1·3 million households. We found that the US health-care sector has some of the highest child-care obligations in the USA, with 28·8% (95% CI 28·5-29·1) of the health-care workforce needing to provide care for children aged 3-12 years. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling aged 13 years or older can provide child care, 15·0% (14·8-15·2) of the health-care workforce would still be in need of child care during a school closure. We observed substantial variation within the health-care system. We estimated that, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15·0% case reduction from school closings and 2·0% baseline mortality rate, a 15·0% decrease in the health-care labour force would need to decrease the survival probability per percent health-care worker lost by 17·6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. Our model estimates that if the infection mortality rate of COVID-19 increases from 2·00% to 2·35% when the health-care workforce declines by 15·0%, school closures could lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. INTERPRETATION: School closures come with many trade-offs, and can create unintended child-care obligations. Our results suggest that the potential contagion prevention from school closures needs to be carefully weighted with the potential loss of health-care workers from the standpoint of reducing cumulative mortality due to COVID-19, in the absence of mitigating measures.

446979,Finding the Calm in the Chaos: An Institutional Protocol for Anesthetic Management of a Patient for Neurosurgery during Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: In 2019, SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 emerged. Severe COVID-19 symptoms may evolve by virtue of hyperactivation of the immune system. Equally, immunocompromised patients may be at increased risk to develop COVID-19. However, treatment guidelines for children following liver transplantation are elusive. METHODS: As a liver transplantation center, we diagnosed and followed up 10 children (male/female: 8/2) with a median age of 8.5 years (IQR: 5.2-11.0), with COVID-19 post-liver transplant between March 2019 and December 2020. COVID-19 diagnosis was based on PCR test and or florid X-ray findings compatible with COVID-19 in the absence of other cause. We retrospectively collected clinical and laboratory data from electronic patient records following written consent from patients/parents. RESULTS: Nine patients were diagnosed as definitive (PCR positive) with one patient being diagnosed as probable COVID-19. Seven patients recovered without any support whereas three were admitted for non-invasive oxygenation. Lymphopenia and/or high levels of serum IL-6 were detected in four patients. Six patients mounted anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at median 30 days (IQR: 26.5-119.0) following COVID-19 diagnosis. Antibiotic therapy, favipiravir, anakinra, and IVIG were used as treatment in 4,1,1 and 2 patients, respectively. Furthermore, we kept the tacrolimus with or without everolimus but stopped MMF in 2 patients. Importantly, liver allograft function was retained in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: We found that being immunocompromised did not affect disease severity nor survival. Stopping MMF yet continuing with tacrolimus was an apt treatment modality in these patients.","Yuksel, Muhammed; Akturk, Hacer; Mizikoglu, Ozlem; Toroslu, Ertug; Arikan, Cigdem",Pediatr Transplant,,404

449197,Suicide prevention and COVID-19,2021,"AIM: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted Emergency Medical Services (EMS) operations throughout the country. Some studies described variation in total volume of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) during the pandemic. We aimed to describe the changes in volume and characteristics of OHCA patients and resuscitations in one urban EMS system. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of all recorded atraumatic OHCA in Marion County, Indiana, from January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2019 and from January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020. We described patient, arrest, EMS response, and survival characteristics. We performed paired and unpaired t-tests to evaluate the changes in those characteristics during COVID-19 as compared to the prior year. Data were matched by month to control for seasonal variation. RESULTS: The total number of arrests increased from 884 in 2019 to 1034 in 2020 (p = 0.016). Comparing 2019 to 2020, there was little difference in age [median 62 (IQR 59-73) and 60 (IQR 47-72), p = 0.086], gender (38.5% and 39.8% female, p = 0.7466, witness to arrest (44.3% and 39.6%, p = 0.092), bystander AED use (10.1% and 11.4% p = 0.379), bystander CPR (48.7% and 51.4%, p = 0.242). Patients with a shockable initial rhythm (19.2% and 15.4%, p = 0.044) both decreased in 2020, and response time increased by 18 s [6.0 min (IQR 4.5-7.7) and 6.3 min (IQR 4.7-8.0), p = 0.008]. 47.7% and 54.8% (p = 0.001) of OHCA patients died in the field, 19.7% and 19.3% (p = 0.809) died in the Emergency Department, 21.8% and 18.5% (p = 0.044) died in the hospital, 10.8% and 7.4% (p = 0.012) were discharged from the hospital, and 9.3% and 5.9% (p = 0.005) were discharged with Cerebral Performance Category score &#8804; 2. CONCLUSION: Total OHCA increased during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with the prior year. Although patient characteristics were similar, initial shockable rhythm, and proportion of patients who died in the hospital decreased during the pandemic.

450108,More eyes on COVID-19: Perspectives from Economics - The economic costs of the pandemic – and its response,2020,"As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to rise and second waves are reported in some countries, serological test kits and strips are being considered to scale up an adequate laboratory response. This study provides an update on the kinetics of humoral immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and performance characteristics of serological protocols (lateral flow assay [LFA], chemiluminescence immunoassay [CLIA] and ELISA) used for evaluations of recent and past SARS-CoV-2 infection. A thorough and comprehensive review of suitable and eligible full-text articles was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Wordometer and medRxiv from 10 January to 16 July 2020. These articles were searched using the Medical Subject Headings terms 'COVID-19', 'Serological assay', 'Laboratory Diagnosis', 'Performance characteristics', 'POCT', 'LFA', 'CLIA', 'ELISA' and 'SARS-CoV-2'. Data from original research articles on SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection &#8805;second day postinfection were included in this study. In total, there were 7938 published articles on humoral immune response and laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19. Of these, 74 were included in this study. The detection, peak and decline period of blood anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG and total antibodies for point-of-care testing (POCT), ELISA and CLIA vary widely. The most promising of these assays for POCT detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 at day 3 postinfection and peaked on the 15th day; ELISA products detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG at days 2 and 6 then peaked on the eighth day; and the most promising CLIA product detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 at day 1 and peaked on the 30th day. The most promising LFA, ELISA and CLIA that had the best performance characteristics were those targeting total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies followed by those targeting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG then IgM. Essentially, the CLIA-based SARS-CoV-2 tests had the best performance characteristics, followed by ELISA then POCT. Given the varied performance characteristics of all the serological assays, there is a need to continuously improve their detection thresholds, as well as to monitor and re-evaluate their performances to assure their significance and applicability for COVID-19 clinical and epidemiological purposes.","Emeribe, Anthony Uchenna; Abdullahi, Idris Nasir; Shuwa, Halima Ali; Uzairue, Leonard; Musa, Sanusi; Anka, Abubakar Umar; Adekola, Hafeez Aderinsayo; Bello, Zakariyya Muhammad; Rogo, Lawal Dahiru; Aliyu, Dorcas; Haruna, Shamsuddeen; Usman, Yahaya; Muhammad, Habiba Yahaya; Gwarzo, Abubakar Muhammad; Nwofe, Justin Onyebuchi; Chiwar, Hassan Musa; Okwume, Chukwudi Crescent; Animasaun, Olawale Sunday; Fasogbon, Samuel Ayobami; Olayemi, Lawal; Ogar, Christopher; Emeribe, Chinenye Helen; Ghamba, Peter Elisha; Awoniyi, Luqman O; Musa, Bolanle O P",International health (Online),,404

452764,The Whole Block Goes Down: Refugees in Japan's detention centers during the pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal blood purification has been proposed as one of the therapeutic approaches in patients with coronavirus infection, because of its beneficial impact on elimination of inflammatory cytokines. METHODS: This controlled trial has been conducted on critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted in the state hospital affiliated to Babol University of Medical Sciences, Iran who received different antiviral and antibacterial drugs, and different modalities of respiratory treatments and did not have positive clinical improvement. No randomization and blindness was considered. All of the participants underwent three sessions of resin-directed hemoperfusion using continuous renal replacement therapy with a mode of continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). RESULTS: Five men and five women with a mean age of 57.30 ± 18.07 years have been enrolled in the study; and six of them have improved after the intervention. Peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) changed after each session. Mean SpO2 before the three sessions of hemoperfusion was 89.60% ± 3.94% and increased to 92.13% ± 3.28% after them (p < 0.001). Serum IL-6 showed a reduction from 139.70 ± 105.62 to 72.06 ± 65.87 pg/mL (p = 0.073); and c-reactive protein decreased from 136.25 ± 84.39 to 78.25 ± 38.67 mg/L (P = 0.016).

453657,Healthy lifestyles in times of pandemic,2020,"BackgroundNovel variants of concern (VOCs) have been associated with both increased infectivity and virulence of SARS-CoV-2. The virulence of SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to age. Whether relative increases in virulence of novel VOCs is similar across the age spectrum, or is limited to some age groups, is unknown. MethodsWe created a retrospective cohort of people in Ontario, Canada testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and screened for VOCs, with dates of test report between February 7 and August 30, 2021 (n=233,799). Cases were classified as N501Y-positive VOC, probable Delta VOC, or VOC undetected. We constructed age-specific logistic regression models to evaluate the effects of N501Y-postive or Delta VOC infections on infection severity, using hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death as outcome variables. Models were adjusted for sex, time, health unit, vaccination status, comorbidities, immune compromise, long-term care residence, healthcare worker status, and pregnancy. ResultsInfection with either N501Y-positive or Delta VOCs was associated with significant elevations in risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, and death in younger and older adults, compared to infections where a VOC was not detected. Delta VOC increased hospitalization risk in children under 10 by a factor of 2.5 (adjusted odds ratio, 95% confidence interval: 1.2 to 5.1) compared to non-VOC. For most VOC-outcome combinations there was no heterogeneity in adverse outcomes by age. However, there was an inverse relationship between age and relative increase in risk of death with delta VOC, with younger age groups showing a greater relative increase in risk of death than older individuals. InterpretationSARS-CoV-2 VOCs appear to be associated with increased relative virulence of infection in all age groups, though low absolute numbers of outcomes in younger individuals make estimates in these groups imprecise.","Fisman, David; Tuite, Ashleigh",,,404
454475,Crise e oportunidades para a preservação digital da informação em saúde,2020,"Despite vaccination and antivirals, influenza remains a communicable disease of high burden, with limited therapeutic options available to patients that develop complications. Here, we report the development and preclinical characterization of Adipose Stromal Cell (ASC) concentrated secretome (CS), generated by process adaptable to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) standards. We demonstrate that ASC-CS limits pulmonary histopathological changes, infiltration of inflammatory cells, protein leak, water accumulation, and arterial oxygen saturation (spO2) reduction in murine model of lung infection with influenza A virus (IAV) when first administered six days post-infection. The ability to limit lung injury is sustained in ASC-CS preparations stored at -80 °C for three years. Priming of the ASC with inflammatory factors TNF&#945; and IFNÎ³ enhances ASC-CS ability to suppress lung injury. IAV infection is associated with dramatic increases in programmed cell death ligand (PDL1) and angiopoietin 2 (Angpt2) levels. ASC-CS application significantly reduces both PDL1 and Angpt2 levels. Neutralization of PDL1 with anti-mouse PDL1 antibody starting Day6 onward effectively ablates lung PDL1, but only non-significantly reduces Angpt2 release. Most importantly, late-phase PDL1 neutralization results in negligible suppression of protein leakage and inflammatory cell infiltration, suggesting that suppression of PDL1 does not play a critical role in ASC-CS therapeutic effects.","Bogatcheva, Natalia V; Coleman, Michael E",,,404

455831,2020: Pandemia por covid-19 y mundo del trabajo: una mirada desde los sectores subalternos,2020,"PURPOSE: A simple, patient-specific biomechanical model (PSBM) is proposed in which the main surgical tools and actions can be simulated, which enables clinicians to evaluate different strategies for an optimal surgical planning. A prospective and comparative clinical study was performed to assess early clinical and radiological results. METHODS: From January 2019 to July 2019, a PSBM was created for every operated acetabular fracture (simulation group). DICOM data were extracted from the pre-operative high-resolution CT scans to build a 3D model of the fracture using segmentation methods. A PSBM was implemented in a custom software allowing a biomechanical simulation of the surgery in terms of reduction sequences. From July 2019 to December 2019, every patient with an operated for acetabular fracture without PSBM was included in the standard group. Surgery duration, blood loss, radiological results and per-operative complications were recorded and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were included, 10 in the simulation group and 12 in the standard group. The two groups were comparable regarding age, time to surgery, fracture pattern distribution and surgical approaches. The mean operative time was significantly lower in the simulation group: 113 min ± 33 (60-180) versus 184 ± 58 (90-260), p = 0.04. The mean blood loss was significantly lower in the simulation group, p = 0.01. No statistical significant differences were found regarding radiological results (p = 0.16). No per-operative complications were recorded. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that pre-operative planning in acetabular surgery based on a PSBM results in a shorter operative time and a reduction of blood loss during surgery. This study also confirms the feasibility of PSBM planning in daily clinical routine. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II: prospective study.","Boudissa, Mehdi; Noblet, Baptiste; Bahl, Gaétan; Oliveri, Hadrien; Herteleer, Michiel; Tonetti, Jérôme; Chabanas, Matthieu",Int. j. comput. assist. radiol. surg.

456999,Short-Term Health Policy Responses to Crisis and Uncertainty,2021,"Objective: ACE2 in addition to be the counterregulatory enzyme in RAS system is the entry point of SARS-CoV-2. Several studies have reported its protective role in SARS-CoV-2-induced Acute Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and a relationship between Rho kinase (ROCK), ARDS and increased ACE2 levels induced by ROCK inhibitors. Cells' ACE2 expression is in two different immunoreactive forms, glycosylated and unglycosylated, but only the glycosylated is associated with viral binding. ACE2-glycosylation is driven by the acidic pH of intracellular endosomes/lysosomes/Golgi vesicles and this represents the rational to the prophylactic/therapeutic use of antimalarial drugs as hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine weak bases that increase the pH of vesicles, which leads to the production of unglycosylated ACE2 and therefore reduction/inhibition of viral binding. Gitelman's and Bartter's syndrome patients (GS/BS) (rare genetic tubulopathies) have activated RAS, high Ang II yet normotension/hypotension, metabolic alkalosis increased and related ACE2 and its product Ang 1-7 levels, reduced ROCK activity therefore may provide information on the protective role of increased ACE2 levels and ROCK inhibition. This study has assessesed the impact of COVID-19 on GS/BS Design and method: We performed a telephone survey on more than 100 GS/ BS from the hotspots of COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Italy (Veneto, Lombardia Emilia Romagna). COVID-19 prevalence in the general population was obtained from Civil Protection's official data and the estimated prevalence from published data. 95% CI values processed with Clopper-Pearson method using Rsoftware Results: None of GS/BS reported infection/symptoms of COVID-19, which was statistically not signi ficant vs the prevalence of COVID-19 in the general population in the Italian hotspots due to the low prevalence of GS/ BS (rare diseases) (95% CI 0.0-3.0% vs 0.65%, 95% CI 0.6-0.7%). It becomes signi ficant vs the estimated prevalence in the general population in the hotspot regions (8.7%, 95% CI 8.7-8.8%, (C2), p=0.004) Conclusions: GS/BS might serve as a human model of increased ACE2 for exvivo mechanistic investigation on viral binding;provide additional evidence on the absence of high ACE2 levels-increased risk of COVID-19;demonstrate that suspension of treatments with ACE inhibitors/ARBs, which increase ACE2 expression to reduce the risk of infection is not rationale.","Bertoldi, G.; Gianesello, L.; Rigato, M.; Sgarabotto, L.; Calò, L.",Journal of Hypertension,,404

459338,The Possible Effects of the Extended Lockdown Period on the South African Economy: A CGE Analysis,2020,"BACKGROUND: Culex (Culex) tritaeniorhynchus is an important vector of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) affecting feral pigs, native mammals and humans. The mosquito species is widely distributed throughout Southeast Asia, Africa and Europe, and thought to be absent in Australia. METHODS: In February and May, 2020 the Medical Entomology unit of the Northern Territory (NT) Top End Health Service collected Cx. tritaeniorhynchus female specimens (n = 19) from the Darwin and Katherine regions. Specimens were preliminarily identified morphologically as the Vishnui subgroup in subgenus Culex. Molecular identification was performed using cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) barcoding, including sequence percentage identity using BLAST and tree-based identification using maximum likelihood analysis in the IQ-TREE software package. Once identified using COI, specimens were reanalysed for diagnostic morphological characters to inform a new taxonomic key to related species from the NT. RESULTS: Sequence percentage analysis of COI revealed that specimens from the NT shared 99.7% nucleotide identity to a haplotype of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus from Dili, Timor-Leste. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the NT specimens formed a monophyletic clade with other Cx. tritaeniorhynchus from Southeast Asia and the Middle East. We provide COI barcodes for most NT species from the Vishnui subgroup to aid future identifications, including the first genetic sequences for Culex (Culex) crinicauda and the undescribed species Culex (Culex) sp. No. 32 of Marks. Useful diagnostic morphological characters were identified and are presented in a taxonomic key to adult females to separate Cx. tritaeniorhynchus from other members of the Vishnui subgroup from the NT. CONCLUSIONS: We report the detection of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus in Australia from the Darwin and Katherine regions of the NT. The vector is likely to be already established in northern Australia, given the wide geographical spread throughout the Top End of the NT. The establishment of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus in Australia is a concern to health officials as the species is an important vector of JEV and is now the sixth species from the subgenus Culex capable of vectoring JEV in Australia. We suggest that the species must now be continuously monitored during routine mosquito surveillance programmes to determine its current geographical spread and prevent the potential transmission of exotic JEV throughout Australia.","Lessard, Bryan D; Kurucz, Nina; Rodriguez, Juanita; Carter, Jane; Hardy, Christopher M",Parasit Vectors,,404
459554,"Book Review: Tanja Kleibl, Ronald Lutz, Ndangwa Noyoo, Benjamin Bunk, Annika Dittmann, Boitumelo Seepamore (eds) The Routledge Handbook of Postcolonial Social Work",2021,"OBJECTIVE: To identify and critically evaluate methods for proning patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU). BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is common in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Proning improves blood oxygenation and survival rates in these patients but is not commonly performed due to the difficulty of the procedure. METHODS: An academic literature review, internet video search, and consultation with five subject-matter experts was performed to identify known methods for proning. Evaluation of each method considered the number of healthcare workers required, physical stresses on staff, risk of adverse events to patients, and equipment cost and availability. RESULTS: Several variations of manual techniques and-lift assisted techniques were identified in addition to a specialized proning bed. Manual methods require more healthcare workers, higher physical stresses, and greater risk of adverse events than lift-assisted methods or the proning bed. CONCLUSION: Both the specialized proning bed and a lift-assisted method using straps largely eliminated manual forces required for proning while allowing for a controlled lowering and positioning of the patient. APPLICATION: This review will guide practitioners to the most suitable methods for proning patients in the ICU.","Wiggermann, Neal; Zhou, Jie; Kumpar, Dee",Hum Factors,,404
459594,Do the ends justify the means? Disability research in social isolation,2021,"Current approaches to fair valuation in insurance often follow a two-step approach, combining quadratic hedging with application of a risk measure on the residual liability, to obtain a cost-of-capital margin. In such approaches, the preferences represented by the regulatory risk measure are not reflected in the hedging process. We address this issue by an alternative two-step hedging procedure, based on generalised regression arguments, which leads to portfolios that are neutral with respect to a risk measure, such as Value-at-Risk or the expectile. First, a portfolio of traded assets aimed at replicating the liability is determined by local quadratic hedging. Second, the residual liability is hedged using an alternative objective function. The risk margin is then defined as the cost of the capital required to hedge the residual liability. In the case quantile regression is used in the second step, yearly solvency constraints are naturally satisfied; furthermore, the portfolio is a risk minimiser among all hedging portfolios that satisfy such constraints. We present a neural network algorithm for the valuation and hedging of insurance liabilities based on a backward iterations scheme. The algorithm is fairly general and easily applicable, as it only requires simulated paths of risk drivers.","Barigou, Karim; Bignozzi, Valeria; Tsanakas, Andreas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04364v1.pdf,404
459661,Social Distancing from the Problem of Japanese Homelessness under Covid-19,2020,"On March 19, 2020, the governor of California issued a statewide stay-at-home order to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).* The order reduced accessibility to and patient attendance at outpatient medical visits, including preventive services such as cervical cancer screening. In-person clinic visits increased when California reopened essential businesses on June 12, 2020.§ Electronic medical records of approximately 1.5 million women served by Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), a large integrated health care system, were examined to assess cervical cancer screening rates before, during, and after the stay-at-home order. KPSC policy is to screen women aged 21-29 years every 3 years with cervical cytology alone (Papanicolaou [Pap] test); those aged 30-65 years were screened every 5 years with human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and cytology (cotesting) through July 15, 2020, and after July 15, 2020, with HPV testing alone, consistent with the latest recommendations from U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.¶ Compared with the 2019 baseline, cervical cancer screening rates decreased substantially during the stay-at-home order. Among women aged 21-29 years, cervical cytology screening rates per 100 person-months declined 78%. Among women aged 30-65 years, HPV test screening rates per 100 person-months decreased 82%. After the stay-at-home order was lifted, screening rates returned to near baseline, which might have been aided by aspects of KPSC's integrated, organized screening program (e.g., reminder systems and tracking persons lost to follow-up). As the pandemic continues, groups at higher risk for developing cervical cancers and precancers should be evaluated first. Ensuring that women receive preventive services, including cancer screening and appropriate follow-up in a safe and timely manner, remains important.","Miller, Maureen J; Xu, Lanfang; Qin, Jin; Hahn, Erin E; Ngo-Metzger, Quyen; Mittman, Brian; Tewari, Devansu; Hodeib, Melissa; Wride, Patricia; Saraiya, Mona; Chao, Chun R",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,404

461128,Testing partnership and preparedness in Northern Ireland during COVID-19,2020,"Sepsis and septic shock are life-threatening conditions and remain an important medical problem, emphasizing the need to identify novel therapeutic approaches. Coagulation dysfunction, hypotension, disturbed microcirculation and multiorgan failure occur frequently. These severe conditions result from an overwhelming inflammatory response, induced by pathogen and damage associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs) released into the bloodstream. In the present study, we demonstrated that the synthetic Lipopolysaccharid (LPS)-binding peptide 19-2.5 interferes with the activation of the coagulation and contact system. Moreover, binding of LPS to high molecular weight kininogen (HK), one of the major LPS carrier in blood, could be prevented by the peptide. Thus, peptide 19-2.5 might represent a promising target in the treatment of endotoxemia and sepsis, not only by its anti-inflammatory potential, but also by the anticoagulant effect, together with its ability to prevent degradation of HK.","Köhler, Juliane; Ehler, Johannes; Kreikemeyer, Bernd; Bajorath, Rika; Schürholz, Tobias; Oehmcke-Hecht, Sonja",Sci Rep,,404
461492,Empathy in medical education: An opportunity after the COVID-19 crisis,2020,"BACKGROUND: The current Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a highly stressful event that may lead to significant psychological symptoms, particularly in cancer patients who are at a greater risk of contracting viruses. This study examined the frequency of stressors experienced in relation to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and its relationship with psychological symptoms (i.e., anxiety, depression, insomnia, fear of cancer recurrence) in breast cancer patients. METHODS: Thirty-six women diagnosed with a non-metastatic breast cancer completed the Insomnia Severity Index, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the severity subscale of the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory, and the COVID-19 Stressors Questionnaire developed by our research team. Participants either completed the questionnaires during (30.6%) or after (69.4%) their chemotherapy treatment. RESULTS: Results revealed that most of the participants (63.9%) have experienced at least one stressor related to the COVID-19 pandemic (one: 27.8%, two: 22.2%, three: 11.1%). The most frequently reported stressor was increased responsibilities at home (33.3%). Higher levels of concerns related to the experienced stressors were significantly correlated with higher levels of anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia, and fear of cancer recurrence, rs(32) = 0.36 to 0.59, all ps < 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients experience a significant number of stressors related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which are associated with increased psychological symptoms. These results contribute to a better understanding of the psychological consequences of a global pandemic in the context of cancer and they highlight the need to better support patients during such a challenging time.","Massicotte, Véronique; Ivers, Hans; Savard, Josée",Curr Oncol,,404

We report the case of a 42-year old COVID-19 positive patient with a fatal intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The patient presented with fever and dyspnea, requiring intubation due to medical complications. After prolonged sedation and anticoagulation, the patient suddenly developed bilaterally fixed and dilated pupils, caused by a right-sided intracranial hemorrhage with uncal herniation. The course of this case illustrates the delicate balance between hypercoagulability and coagulation factor depletion; especially in the intubated and sedated patient, in whom regular neurological assessments are impeded. As we expand our understanding of the neurological ramifications of COVID-19, clinicians need to be increasingly aware of the precarious coagulation balance.","Khattar, Nicolas K; Sharma, Mayur; McCallum, Abigail P; Oxford, Brent G; Zeb, Hassan; Suliman, Sally A; Sieg, Emily P; Mocco, J; Neimat, Joseph S; Zemmar, Ajmal",Interdiscip Neurosurg,,404

Methods: We conducted an exploratory, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of hospitalised subjects with severe COVID-19 (pulmonary infiltrates and oxygen saturation.94% on room air) conducted at four tertiary care centres in India. Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either 0.3 mL.day(-1) of Mw intradermally or a matching placebo for three consecutive days. The primary outcome of the study was the distribution of clinical status assessed on a seven-point ordinal scale ranging from discharged (category 1) to death (category 7) on study days 14, 21, and 28. The co-primary outcome was a change in SOFA (sequential organ failure assessment) score on days 7 and 14 compared to the baseline. The secondary outcomes were 28-day mortality, time to clinical recovery, time to reverse transcription PCR negativity, adverse events, and others. Results: We included 42 subjects (22 Mw, 20 placebo). On days 14 (OR 30.4 (95% CI 3.3-276.4)) and 21 (OR 14.9 (95% CI 1.8-128.4)), subjects in the M-w arm had a better clinical status distribution than placebo. There was no difference in the SOFA score change on days 7 and 14 between the two groups. We did not find any difference in the mortality, or other secondary outcomes. We observed no adverse events related to the use of M-w. Conclusions: The use of Mw results in better clinical status distribution on days 14 and 21 compared to placebo in critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Sehgal, I.

464084,Studying during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Nursing Student’s Perspectives and Experiences in Saudi Arabia,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging viral infection without any approved treatment. Investigational therapies for COVID-19 may cause clinically important drug-drug interactions (DDIs). We aimed to study potential DDIs (pDDIs) and their risk factors in COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a tertiary respiratory hospital dedicated to COVID-19 patients. The Lexi-Interact database was used to investigate clinically important pDDIs. The database output including interacting drug pairs, risk rating, reliability rating, mechanism, and management was evaluated. Associations between the occurrence of pDDIs and probable risk factors were assessed by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Medical charts of 227 patients were reviewed. About 38% of the patients had at least one clinically important pDDI. More than half of the interactions were between protease inhibitors (lopinavir/ritonavir) and regularly prescribed medications for the management of comorbidities or COVID-19 symptoms (e.g., atorvastatin, alprazolam, salmeterol, and tamsulosin). Ischemic heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, and ICU admission were significantly associated with the occurrence of pDDIs. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend considering the risk factors for the emergence of clinically important DDIs in the pharmacotherapy of COVID-19 patients. Using an alternative medication or dose adjustments may be required in high-risk patients.","Mahboobipour, Amir Ali; Baniasadi, Shadi",Drug Metab. Pers. Ther,,404

Against this background student tutors of the Medical Faculty Erlangen have developed a training concept. The aim was to familiarize students in the clinical section quickly and effectively with skills that are particularly important in a clinical assignment as (student) assistant in the care of corona patients (e.g.: personal protective equipment, intubation assistance, arterial blood collection, assessment of blood gas values and ventilation parameters). In a blended learning concept, learning materials were prepared in advance and then implemented and deepened in a presence phase. The selection of learning materials and the low supervision ratio (1:2) made it possible to realize an internally differentiated approach. The offer met with great interest among students of all clinical semesters and was evaluated very positively.

Social behaviors and spatial transitions during and after the lockdown",2021,"Throughout the world, laws play an important role in shaping population health. Law making is an intervention with measurable effects yet often unfolds without evaluation or monitoring. Policy surveillance-the systematic, scientific collection and analysis of laws of public health significance-can help bridge this gap by capturing important features of law in numeric form in structured longitudinal data sets.Currently deployed primarily in high-income countries, methods for cross-national policy surveillance hold significant promise, particularly given the growing quality and accessibility of global health data. Global policy surveillance can enable comparative research on the implementation and health impact of laws, their spread, and their political determinants. Greater transparency of status and trends in law supports health policy advocacy and promotes public accountability. Collecting, coding, and analyzing laws across countries presents numerous challenges-especially in low-resource settings.With insights from comparative politics and law, we suggest methods to address those challenges. We describe how longitudinal legal data have been used in limited, but important, ways for cross-national analysis and propose incorporating global policy surveillance into core global public health practice.","Kavanagh, Matthew M; Meier, Benjamin Mason; Pillinger, Mara; Huffstetler, Hanna; Burris, Scott",Am J Public Health,,404
466875,Medical ethics and COVID-19. Society of Physicians Ethics Committee of the Caracas Hospital,2020,"A study by Saraiva et al. (2011) demonstrated the presence of Angiotensin II receptors on the erythrocyte membrane. This little-known information should be deemed as crucial as the SARS-CoV-2 relationships with oxygen saturation and the Renine Angiotensin System but it currently remains unexploited. The pulmonary and cardiovascular systems are involved in any typical complications of COVID-19 but numerous other unrelated symptoms may occur. To fill the gap, we shall first emphasize some similarities between the complications of this infectious disease and Decompression Illness (DCI), which involves bubble formation. We theorized that the Angiotensin II clearance by the red blood cells could trigger the release of its oxygen content in the bloodstream. The resulting foam would worsen the widespread endotheliitis, worsen the gas exchange, trigger the coagulation process, the inflammation process and the complement pathway as typically occurs in DCI. At the end, we propose a plausible mechanism.","Denis, Pierre A",Med Hypotheses,,404

These factors amplify the threats to our health from infectious hazards, natural disasters, armed conflicts and other emergencies wherever they may occur. The current CoVID-19 pandemic has provided a clear demonstration of the fact that our ability to detect and predict the initial emergence of a novel human pathogen (for example, the spill-over of a virus from its animal reservoir to a human host), and our capacity to forecast the spread and transmission the pathogen in human society remains limited. Improving ways in which we prepare will enable a more rapid and effective response and enable proactive preparations (including exercising) to respond to any novel emerging infectious disease outbreaks. This study aims to explore the current state of pandemic preparedness exercising and provides an assessment of a number of case study exercises for health hazards against the key components of the WHO's Exercises for Pandemic Prepared Plans (EPPP) framework in order to gauge their usefulness in preparation for pandemics. The paper also examines past crises involving large-scale epidemics and pandemics and whether simulations took place to test health security capacities either in advance of the crisis based on risk assessments, strategy and plans or after the crisis in order to be better prepared should a similar scenario arise in the future. Exercises for animal and human diseases have been included to provide a ""one health"" perspective [1,2]. This article then goes on to examine approaches to simulation exercises relevant to prepare for health crisis involving a novel emergent pathogen like CoVID-19. This article demonstrates that while simulations are useful as part of a preparedness strategy, the key is to ensure that lessons from these simulations are learned and the associated changes made as soon as possible following any simulation in order to ensure that simulations are effective in bringing about changes in practice that will improve pandemic preparedness. Furthermore, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies could also be applied in preparing communities for outbreak detection, surveillance and containment, and be a useful tool for providing immersive environments for simulation exercises for pandemic preparedness and associated interventions which may be particularly useful at the strategic level. This article contributes to the limited literature in pandemic preparedness simulation exercising to deal with novel health crises, like CoVID-19. The analysis has also identified potential areas for further research or work on pandemic preparedness exercising.","Reddin, Karen; Bang, Henry; Miles, Lee",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,,404

471214,COVID-19 contact tracing apps: UK public perceptions,2021,"Correctional and detention facilities face unique challenges in the control of infectious diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1-3). Among >10 million annual admissions to U.S. jails, approximately 55% of detainees are released back into their communities each week (4); in addition, staff members at correctional and detention facilities are members of their local communities. Thus, high rates of COVID-19 in correctional and detention facilities also have the potential to influence broader community transmission. In March 2020, the Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) began implementing surveillance for COVID-19 among correctional and detention facilities in Louisiana and identified cases and outbreaks in many facilities. In response, LDH and CDC developed and deployed the COVID-19 Management Assessment and Response (CMAR) tool to guide technical assistance focused on infection prevention and control policies and case management with correctional and detention facilities. This report describes COVID-19 prevalence in correctional and detention facilities detected through surveillance and findings of the CMAR assessment. During March 25-April 22, 489 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 37 (7.6%) hospitalizations and 10 (2.0%) deaths among incarcerated or detained persons, and 253 cases, including 19 (7.5%) hospitalizations and four (1.6%) deaths among staff members were reported. During April 8-22, CMAR telephone-based assessments were conducted with 13 of 31 (42%) facilities with laboratory-confirmed cases and 11 of 113 (10%) facilities without known cases. Administrators had awareness and overall understanding of CDC guidance for prevention of transmission in these facilities but reported challenges in implementation, related to limited space to quarantine close contacts of COVID-19 patients and inability of incarcerated and detained persons to engage in social distancing, particularly in dormitory-style housing. CMAR was a useful tool that helped state and federal public health officials assist multiple correctional and detention facilities to better manage COVID-19 patients and guide control activities to prevent or mitigate transmission.","Wallace, Megan; Marlow, Mariel; Simonson, Sean; Walker, Marceia; Christophe, Natalie; Dominguez, Olivia; Kleamenakis, Lauren; Orellana, Angie; Pagan-Pena, Doriselys; Singh, Calandre; Pogue, Michele; Saucier, Leslie; Lo, Terrence; Benson, Kelsey; Sokol, Theresa",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,404

473605,"Supporting Black, Indigenous, and Students of Color in Learning Environments Transformed by COVID-19",2021,"Human interleukin-6 (hIL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine that regulates immune and inflammatory responses in addition to metabolic and regenerative processes and cancer. hIL-6 binding to the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R&#945;) induces homodimerization and recruitment of the glycoprotein (gp130) to form a hexameric signaling complex. Anti-IL-6 and IL-6R antibodies are clinically approved inhibitors of IL-6 signaling pathway for treating rheumatoid arthritis and Castleman's disease, respectively. There is a potential to develop novel small molecule IL-6 antagonists derived from understanding the structural basis for IL-6/IL-6R&#945; interactions. Here, we combine homology modeling with extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine the association of hIL-6 with IL-6R&#945;. A comparison with MD of apo hIL-6 reveals that the binding of hIL-6 to IL-6R&#945; induces structural and dynamic rearrangements in the AB loop region of hIL-6, disrupting intraprotein contacts and increasing the flexibility of residues 48 to 58 of the AB loop. In contrast, due to the involvement of residues 59 to 78 in forming contacts with the receptor, these residues of the AB loop are observed to rigidify in the presence of the receptor. The binary complex is primarily stabilized by two pairs of salt bridges, Arg181 (hIL-6)- Glu182 (IL-6R&#945;) and Arg184 (hIL-6)- Glu183 (IL-6R&#945;) as well as hydrophobic and aromatic stacking interactions mediated essentially by Phe residues in both proteins. An interplay of electrostatic, hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, and aromatic stacking interactions facilitates the formation of the hIL-6/IL-6R&#945; complex.","Gupta, Madhulika; Ha, Khanh; Agarwal, Rupesh; Quarles, Leigh Darryl; Smith, Jeremy C",Proteins,,404

This study aimed to identify risk factors associated with mortality and outcomes among hospitalized Mexican patients with COVID-19. Methods: We prospectively assessed patients admitted to a COVID-19 reference center in the southeast of Mexico between March 28th and June 30th, 2020. Mortality was defined as survivor or non-survivor and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to explore the association of clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters with mortality. Results: We included 200 patients with a mean age of 55 years, 69% were men, 72% had at least one chronic comorbidity. Eighty-six patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with an overall mortality rate of 82.5%. Only 51% of patients with IMV had Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, with a survival rate of 27.3%, but only 7.2% for Non-ICU admission (p<0.014). The multivariate analysis found that Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio &#8805; 9 (OR 4.64, 95% CI 2.05-10.53) albumin < 3.5gr/dL (OR 3.76, 95% CI 1.56-9.07), LDH &#8805; 725 U/L (OR 5.45, 95% CI 2.36-12.57) and IMV (OR 64.7; 95% CI 15.20-275.39) were independent risk factors associated with mortality. Conclusion: NLR, LDH, albumin and IMV are independent risk factors for mortality in Mexican patients with COVID-19. Also, availability of ICU resources is invaluable for better outcomes of critically ill patients. Our results could provide clinical information for timely decision-making in low and middle-income countries to overcome the pandemic.","Cortés-Tellés, Arturo; López-Romero, Stephanie; Mancilla-Ceballos, Roberto; Ortíz-Farías, Diana Lizbeth; Núñez-Caamal, Nelda; Figueroa-Hurtado, Esperanza",,,404

In this context, some associated skin diseases have been described. Cutaneous lesions referred to as acute acro-ischemia have been reported as a possible sign of COVID-19 in adolescents and children. Objective: To evaluate the pathogenesis of these newly described acute acral lesions. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective case series was conducted at La Fe University Hospital, a tertiary referral hospital in Valencia, Spain, between April 9 and April 15, 2020. Among 32 referred patients, 20 children and adolescents with new-onset inflammatory lesions did not have a diagnosis. Exposures: Patients were not exposed to any drug or other intervention. Main Outcomes and Measures: We performed reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 and a range of blood tests for possible origins of the lesions. Skin biopsies were performed in 6 patients. Results: Of the 20 patients enrolled, 7 were female and 13 were male, with an age range of 1 to 18 years. Clinical findings fit into the following patterns: acral erythema (6 patients), dactylitis (4 patients), purpuric maculopapules (7 patients), and a mixed pattern (3 patients). None of the patients had remarkable hematologic or serologic abnormalities, including negative antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Biopsies performed in 6 patients showed histologic findings characteristic of perniosis.

To date, there is a paucity of patient selection criteria and prognosticators to facilitate decision making and enhance precious ICU capacity. METHODS: Prospective study of COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheotomy (n = 12) over a 4-week period (March-April 2020). Association between preoperative and postoperative ventilation requirements and outcomes (ICU stay, time to decannulation, and death) were examined. RESULTS: Patients who sustained FiO2 &#8804; 50% and PEEP &#8804; 8 cm H2 O in the 24 hours pretracheotomy exhibited a favorable outcome. Those whose requirements remained below these thresholds post-tracheotomy could be safely stepped down after 48 hours. CONCLUSION: Sustained FiO2 &#8804; 50% and PEEP &#8804; 8 cm H2 O in the 48 hours post-tracheotomy are strong predictive factors for a good outcome, raising the potential for these patients to be stepped down early, thus increasing ICU capacity.","Stubington, Thomas J; Mallick, Ali S; Garas, Georgios; Stubington, Emma; Reddy, Chetan; Mansuri, Mohammed S",Head Neck,,404

We show that oral application of broad-spectrum antibiotics in mice changed not only diversity, but composition and sharing of gut and vaginal microbiomes in mice and influenced cervical cancer development in an orthotopic tumor model. Antibiotics decreased richness and diversity indexes in the gut but increased them in the vagina. Some beneficial taxa, such as Bacteroides, Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae increased their abundance in the vagina while other pathogenic species, such as Proteobacteria, were decreased. As a result of the changes, mice with greater richness and diversity of the vaginal microbiome after antibiotics exposure were less likely developed tumors.

When exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the immune system responds by expressing antibodies at levels that can be detected and monitored to identify the fraction of the population potentially immunized against SARS-CoV-2 and support efforts to deploy a vaccine strategically. A SPR sensor coated with a peptide monolayer and functionalized with various sources of SARS-CoV-2 recombinant proteins expressed in different cell lines detected human anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in the nanomolar range. Nucleocapsid expressed in different cell lines did not significantly change the sensitivity of the assays, whereas the use of a CHO cell line to express spike ectodomain led to excellent performance. This bioassay was performed on a portable SPR instrument capable of measuring 4 biological samples within 30 minutes of sample/sensor contact and the chip could be regenerated at least 9 times. Multi-site validation was then performed with in-house and commercial ELISA, which revealed excellent cross-correlations with Pearson’s coefficients exceeding 0.85 in all cases, for measurements in DBS and plasma.

485855,8-7 Online Clinical for 5th-year Medical Students Using Zoom,2020,"Insulator proteins orchestrate the three-dimensional organization of the genome. Insulators function by facilitating communications between regulatory sequences and gene promoters, allowing accurate gene transcription regulation during embryo development and cell differentiation. However, the role of insulator proteins beyond genome organization and transcription regulation remains unclear. Suppressor of Hairy wing [Su(Hw)] is a Drosophila insulator protein that plays an important function in female oogenesis. Here we find that su(Hw) has an unsuspected role in genome stability during cell differentiation. We show that su(Hw) mutant developing egg chambers have poorly formed microtubule organization centers (MTOCs) in the germarium and display mislocalization of the anterior/posterior axis specification factor gurken in later oogenesis stages. Additionally, eggshells from partially rescued su(Hw) mutant female germline exhibit dorsoventral patterning defects. These phenotypes are very similar to phenotypes found in the important class of spindle mutants or in piRNA pathway mutants in Drosophila, in which defects generally result from the failure of germ cells to repair DNA damage. Similarities between mutations in su(Hw) and spindle and piRNA mutants are further supported by an excess of DNA damage in nurse cells, and because Gurken localization defects are partially rescued by mutations in the ATR (mei-41) and Chk1 (grapes) DNA damage response genes. Finally, we also show that su(Hw) mutants produce an elevated number of chromosome breaks in dividing neuroblasts from larval brains. Together, these findings suggest that Su(Hw) is necessary for the maintenance of genome integrity during Drosophila development, in both germline and dividing somatic cells.","Hsu, Shih-Jui; Stow, Emily C; Simmons, James R; Wallace, Heather A; Lopez, Andrea Mancheno; Stroud, Shannon; Labrador, Mariano",Chromosoma,,404

Although the exact pathophysiological mechanisms are not yet fully understood, thrombosis is clearly a highly important in the prognosis and outcome of COVID-19. As such, there is a need for diagnostic analysis and quantification of the coagulation potential in these patients, both at diagnosis and follow-up. Global coagulation assays like thrombin generation (TG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) might be suitable in estimating COVID-19 associated coagulopathy and thrombosis risk. Therefore, we aimed at validating both assays for samples with high levels of fibrinogen and in the presence of anticoagulant heparins, such as commonly observed for COVID-19 ICU patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Calibrated Automated Thrombography (CAT) was optimized to assess plasma thrombin generation in the presence of heparins. The final conditions with either 10 µg/mL Ellagic acid (EA) or PPP Reagent HIGH (high tissue factor; HPPH) were validated according to the EP5 protocol for within-run and between-run variability. Overall variability was well below 10%. To estimate the influences of heparins and high fibrinogen levels, CAT was performed on spiked plasma aliquots from 13 healthy volunteers. Comparable to the CAT method, tPA-ROTEM was used to validate the effect of high fibrinogen and heparins on clotting time, clot firmness and clot lysis parameters. RESULTS: Our adjusted COVID-19 assay showed a heparin dose dependent decrease in peak height and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) for both EA and HPPH triggered variants. High fibrinogen did not alter the inhibitory effect of either LMWH or UFH, nor did it influence the peak height or ETP in any of the conditions. The tPA-ROTEM showed a significant prolongation in clotting time with the additions of heparin, which normalized with the addition of high fibrinogen. MCF was markedly increased in all hyperfibrinogenemic conditions. A trend towards increased lysis time and, thus, decreased fibrinolysis was observed. CONCLUSION: Thrombin generation and tPA-ROTEM protocols for measurements in the COVID-19 populations were adjusted and validated. The adjusted thrombin generation assay shows good sensitivity for measurements in heparin spiked plasma. High levels of fibrinogen did not alter the assay or the effectiveness of heparins as measured in this assay. t-PA ROTEM was effective in measurement of both high fibrinogen and heparins spiked samples and was sensitive to the expected relevant coagulant changes by these conditions.

486366,Social stigma in time of COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from India,2021,"Here, we report on a quasi-experimental study to explore the applicability and perceived benefits of the CRAFT program, which is based on mindfulness, yoga, positive psychology, and emotional intelligence, to improve higher education student musicians' health and well-being during the lockdown. A subset of student musicians at a Higher Conservatory of Music in Spain followed the CRAFT program during the academic year 2019/2020, 1 h per week as part of their curriculum. Students enrolled in CRAFT-based elective subjects formed the CRAFT program group (n = 40), while other students represented the control group (n = 53). The onset of the national lockdown elicited by the COVID-19 pandemic occurred halfway through the program, which was subsequently delivered in an online format. We administered an online survey to explore the effect that the exposure to the CRAFT program had in terms of how participants dealt with various health and well-being concerns arising from the COVID-19 lockdown. There was a significantly higher proportion of proactive participants in the CRAFT program group, 92%, than in the control group, 58%, in terms of implementing practices to improve their health and well-being during the lockdown. Additionally, significantly more participants acknowledged perceived benefits from their practices in the CRAFT program group, 78%, than in the control group, 52%. Among proactive participants, yoga/meditation was the most implemented in the CRAFT program group, followed by exercise, and other yoga/meditation practices, whereas in the control group, exercise and Alexander technique-based practices were the most applied. In the CRAFT program group, the highest rate of perceived benefits was from yoga/meditation CRAFT-based practices, 51%, followed by exercise, 32%, and other yoga/meditation practices, 27%, whereas in the control group, benefits were reported by 29% of exercising participants and 16% for those having practiced the Alexander technique. A similar pattern was observed when excluding participants with previous yoga/meditation experience. This study revealed how participants can independently apply learned skills from the CRAFT program in response to a naturally occurring life event of unprecedented global impact, suggesting that previous exposure to mindfulness and yoga is likely to have a beneficial effect on how young adults react towards exceptionally stressful conditions.","Bartos, L.

486404,Recomendações sobre o suo de máscaras no contexto do covid-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether the combination of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine leads to interactions in pharmacokinetics (PKs) and pharmacodynamics (PDs). In this study, the influence of salvianolate and aspirin on metabolic enzymes, and the relationship between the blood concentration and pharmacodynamic indexes, were determined. METHOD: In this, randomized, parallel-grouped, single-center clinical trial, 18 patients with coronary heart disease were randomly allocated into three groups: aspirin (AP) group, salvianolate (SV) group, and combination (A + S) group. All treatment courses lasted for 10 days, and blood samples were acquired before and after administration at different timepoints. The expression of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), CD62p, procaspase-activating compound 1 (PAC-1), P2Y12, phosphodiesterase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MAPK8) were compared with variance analysis The blood concentrations were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Sixteen subjects completed the study. No significant difference in COMT was found among groups, although there was a decrease in the SV group. The PK results indicated that the absorption time of salicylic acid was shortened and the AUC0-&#8734; decreased and the elimination time of salvianolic acid B was prolonged and the AUC0-&#8734; decreased. The PD results declined after administration. A significant difference was found in MAPK8, CD62p, and P2Y12 expression. Compared with the SV group, a significant difference in P2Y12 in the A + S group was found. CONCLUSION: A pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction was found in the aspirin and salvianolate combination. Pharmacodynamically, there was no difference between the A + S and AP groups. However, P2Y12 expression in the combination group was superior to that in the SV group.

The primary outcome was death four weeks after hospital admission. Data on demographics, clinical features, laboratory tests, CT-scan findings, therapeutic management and complications were collected. RESULTS: All in all, 100 patients were analyzed, including 49 patients &#8805;80 years. Seventy percent had &#8805;2 comorbidities. Respiratory features were often severe as 48% needed oxygen support upon admission. Twenty-eight out of 43 patients (65%) with a CT-scan had mild to severe parenchymal impairment, and 38/43 (88%) had bilateral impairment. Thirty-two patients presented respiratory distress requiring oxygen support &#8805;6 liters/minute. Twenty-four deaths occurred, including 21 during hospitalization in our unit, 2 among the 8 patients transferred to ICU, and one at home after discharge from hospital, leading to a global mortality rate of 24% at W4. Age, acute renal failure and respiratory distress were associated with mortality at W4. CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of elderly COVID-19 patients with several comorbidities and severe clinical features survived, a finding that could provide arguments against transferring the most fragile patients to ICU.","Palich, R; Wakim, Y; Itani, O; Paccoud, O; Boussouar, S; Lévy-Soussan, M; Soulie, C; Godefroy, N; Bleibtreu, A",,,404

489095,Flattening the covid-19 curve: A myth or reality-a questionnaire based study,2020,"The pandemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome disease caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), had profound impact in many countries and their health care systems. Regarding Portugal, a suppression strategy with social distancing was adopted, attempting to break the transmission chains, bending the epidemy curve and reducing mortality. These measures seek to prevent an eventual National Health Service over-running, enforcing the suspension of all elective and non-urgent health care. Despite the success in so far, there is a consensus on the need to recover the previous level of health care provision and further enhance it. The Portuguese National Health Service, as a public, universal access, health care system funded by the State proved, in this context, its importance and relevance to the Portuguese population. However, long standing issues, such as the pre pandemic over long waiting lists for hospital ophthalmology attendance, whose determinants are fully identified but still unmet, emerge amplified from this pandemic. The lack of primary eye care in the National Health Service is a significant bottleneck, placing a huge stress on hospital-based care. An exclusive ophthalmologist's center care was over-runned before pandemic and will be even more so. The optometrist's exclusion from differentiated, multisectoral and multidisciplinary eye care teams remains the main hurdle to overcome and insure universal eye care in Portugal. National Health Service highlights the consequences of an overcome model. Universal eye care more than ever demands an evidence-based, integrated approach with primary eye care, in the community, on time and of proximity.","Carneiro, Vera Lúcia Alves; Andrade, Helena; Matias, Luísa; de Sousa, Raul Alberto Ribeiro Correia",J Optom,,404

491354,Clinical Characteristics of Covid-19 in China,2020,"IL-1 induces a significant number of metabolic and hematological changes. In experimental animals, IL-1 treatments cause hypotension due to rapid reduction of systemic blood pressure, reduced vascular resistance, increased heart rate and leukocyte aggregations. IL-1 causes endothelial dysfunction, the triggering factor of which may be of a different nature including pathogen infection. This dysfunction, which includes macrophage intervention and increased protein permeability, can be mediated by several factors including cytokines and arachidonic acid products. These effects are caused by the induction of IL-1 in various pathologies, including those caused by pathogenic viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2 which provokes COVID-19. Activation of macrophages by coronavirus-19 leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, metalloproteinases and other proteolytic enzymes that can cause thrombi formation and severe respiratory dysfunction. Patients with COVID-19, seriously ill and hospitalized in intensive care, present systemic inflammation, intravascular coagulopathy with high risk of thrombotic complications, and venous thromboembolism, effects mostly mediated by IL-1. In these patients the lungs are the most critical target organ as it can present an increase in the degradation products of fibrin, fibrinogen and D-dimer, with organ lesions and respiratory failure. It is well known that IL-1 induces itself and another very important pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF, which also participates in hemodynamic states, including shock syndrome in COVID-19. Both IL-1 and TNF cause pulmonary edema, thrombosis and bleeding. In addition to hypotension and resistance of systemic blood pressure, IL-1 causes leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. The formation of thrombi is the main complication of the circulatory system and functionality of the organ, and represents an important cause of morbidity and mortality. IL-1 causes platelet vascular thrombogenicity also on non-endothelial cells by stimulating the formation of thromboxane A2 which is released into the inflamed environment. IL-1 is the most important immune molecule in inducing fever, since it is involved in the metabolism of arachidonic acid which increases from vascular endothelial organs of the hypothalamus. The pathogenesis of thrombosis, vascular inflammation and angigenesis involves the mediation of the activation of the prostanoid thromboxane A2 receptor. In 1986, in an interesting article (Conti P, Reale M, Fiore S, Cancelli A, Angeletti PU, Dinarello CA. In vitro enhanced thromboxane B2 release by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages after treatment with human recombinant interleukin 1. Prostaglandins. 1986 Jul;32(1):111-5), we reported for the first time that IL-1 induces thromboxane B2 (TxB2) releases in activated neutrophils and macrophages. An increase in thromboxane can induce leukocyte aggregation and systemic inflammation, which would account for the dramatic thrombi formation and organ dysfunction. Hence, IL-1 stimulates endothelial cell-leukocyte adhesion, and TxB2 production. All these events are supported by the large increase in neutrophils that adhere to the lung and the decrease in lymphocytes. Therefore, ecosanoids such as TxA2 (detected as TxB2) have a powerful action on vascular inflammation and platelet aggregation, mediating the formation of thrombi. The thrombogenesis that occurs in COVID-19 includes platelet and cell aggregation with clotting abnormalities, and anti-clotting inhibitor agents are used in the prevention and therapy of thrombotic diseases. Prevention of or induction of TxA2 avoids thrombi formation induced by IL-1. However, in some serious vascular events where TxA2 increases significantly, it is difficult to inhibit, therefore, it would be much better to prevent its induction and generation by blocking its inductors including IL-1. The inhibition or lack of formation of IL-1 avoids all the above pathological events which can lead to death of the patient. The treatment of innate immune cells producing IL-1 with IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) can avoid hemodynamic changes, septic shock and organ inflammation by carrying out a new therapeutic efficacy on COVID-19 induced by SARS-CoV-2.","Conti, P; Caraffa, Al; Gallenga, C E; Ross, R; Kritas, S K; Frydas, I; Younes, A; Di Emidio, P; Ronconi, G; Toniato, E",J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,,404

We report diverse virological characteristics of UK intensive care patients enrolled in the Immunoglobulin Domain of the REMAP-CAP randomised controlled trial that potentially influence treatment outcomes. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs collected pre-treatment was quantified by PCR. Antibody status was determined by spike-protein ELISA. B.1.1.7 was differentiated from other SARS-CoV-2 strains using allele-specific probes or restriction site polymorphism (SfcI) targeting D1118H. RESULTS: Of 1274 subjects, 90% were PCR-positive with viral loads 118-1.7x10 11 IU/ml. Median viral loads were 40-fold higher in those seronegative for IgG antibodies (n=354; 28%) compared to seropositives (n=939; 72%). Frequencies of B.1.1.7 increased from <1% in early November, 2020 to 82% of subjects in January 2021. Seronegative individuals with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 had significantly higher viral loads than seropositives (medians 5.8x10 6 and 2.0 x10 5 IU/ml respectively; p=2x10 -15). However, viral load distributions were elevated in both seronegative and seropositive subjects infected with B.1.1.7 (4.0x10 6 and 1.6x10 6 IU/ml respectively). CONCLUSIONS: High viral loads in seropositive B.1.1.7-infected subjects and resistance to seroconversion indicate less effective clearance by innate and adaptive immune responses.

493915,"Modern Pandemics and Old Methods: What AIDS, SARS, Ebola and the Long History of Quarantine Tell Us about Covid-19",2020,"OBJECTIVE: To identify how best to provide smoking cessation advice and support during the Covid-19 pandemic. Preferences were assessed in relation to: (i) specific forms of tobacco cessation support (eg, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and various counseling formats); (ii) information sources (eg, government officials, doctors); and (iii) channels via which to receive relevant information (eg, television, social media). METHODS: An online survey was administered to adults who smoke tobacco in Australia (nâ=â604) and the UK (nâ=â600). Descriptive analyses were conducted to identify levels of interest in cessation support and information provision. Differences in responses according to demographic characteristics and smoking history were assessed. RESULTS: Around half of the respondents were interested in receiving personal counseling and/or participating in a text support program over the next month. By far the most popular delivery mechanism for personal counseling was email. Three-quarters of the sample expressed an interest in receiving free, home-delivered NRT. The most popular information sources nominated by respondents seeking more information about smokers' Covid-related risks were government departments and their doctor/general practitioner. Television and online news sources were the most preferred information dissemination channels. CONCLUSIONS: The substantial levels of interest expressed in accessing various forms of cessation assistance within the next month suggest that Covid-19 may be increasing receptiveness to quitting. The strong interest in free, home-delivered NRT indicates that this may be a useful mechanism for facilitating quit attempts during the pandemic.","Pettigrew, Simone; Jun, Min; Roberts, Ian; Bullen, Chris; Nallaiah, Kellie; Rodgers, Anthony",J Addict Med,,404
494266,Cuidados com a transmissão: o que levou o Ceará ao epicentro da COVID-19?,2020,"As stated in the framework provided by the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model (Bakker and Demerouti, 2008), the demand dimension corresponds to the constraints imposed by the organization such as work pressure and the resource dimension corresponds to the advantages offered by the organization such as autonomy or social support. These two dimensions of demands and resources thus counterbalance each other and define the level of work commitment and finally its consequences in terms of performance. In the context of telework, which was the rule during the period of containment due to the COVID crisis, our qualitative field survey (involving more than 80 people) revealed numerous human risks such as demotivation, difficulties in resting on clear work instructions or a loss of meaning at middle management level had a direct effect on human reliability (Dhillon, 2013) and generally on work engagement. The problem is that the risk of a decline in work commitment is not something visible to the organization. We therefore propose to combine the JD-R model with the Bow-Tie method (Khakzad et al., 2012). Thus, the event becomes the work engagement, the threats, the demands (here we add the confinement) and the resources and the consequences correspond to the performance.

The present study utilized the two-bottle choice and operant self-administration procedures to investigate neuroanatomical substrates that mediate the effects of PPARÎ³ agonism on alcohol drinking and seeking in msP rats. Bilateral infusions of pioglitazone (0, 5, and 10 µg/µl) in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) decreased voluntary alcohol drinking and alcohol self-administration. Microinjections of pioglitazone in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), central amygdala (CeA), and nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell had no such effect. Notably, water, food, and saccharin consumption was unaltered by either treatment. The yohimbine-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking was prevented by infusions of pioglitazone (0, 2.5, 5, and 10 µg/µl) in the CeA, VTA, and RMTg but not in the NAc shell. These results emphasize the involvement of mesocorticolimbic circuitries in mediating the effects of PPARÎ³ agonists on alcohol drinking and seeking. These results will facilitate future studies that investigate the pathophysiological role of PPARÎ³ in alcohol use disorder and help clarify the mechanisms by which the activation of this receptor decreases the motivation for drinking.","Fotio, Yannick; Borruto, Anna Maria; Benvenuti, Federica; Demopulos, Gregory; Gaitanaris, George; Roberto, Marisa; Ciccocioppo, Roberto",Neuropsychopharmacol,,404

Research conducted during past epidemics found that pregnant women are more vulnerable psychologically. The aim of this study was to investigate antenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms during this pandemic in Greece. METHODS: All women receiving routine antenatal care, during a three-month period, starting one week after the total lockdown in Greece, in a University department, were asked to fill in two questionnaires, the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). RESULTS: Overall, 505 women (93.3% of the eligible population) agreed to participate. The prevalence of antenatal depression (EPDS score&#8805;13) in the population of the study was 13.5%. Unplanned pregnancy (OR: 2.447; 95% CI: 1.235-4.846), smoking (OR: 2.268; 95% CI: 1.166-4.411) and antenatal anxiety (OR: 5.074; 95% CI: 2.898-8.883) increased the risk of antenatal depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. State (current)-anxiety affected 34.1% of the participants, whereas Trait (lifetime)-anxiety affected 15.8%. The State-anxiety score (median) was significantly higher than the Trait-anxiety (median) (41 vs. 36; p<0.001), revealing an increase in the levels of anxiety in the pandemic, while there was also a positive linear correlation between the two scales (rho=0.592; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The unprecedented situation of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased anxiety, but not depression levels of pregnant women in Greece. Population level interventions to address adverse effects on anxiety status in the initial phases of similar situations may be helpful in the future.","Tsakiridis, Ioannis; Dagklis, Themistoklis; Mamopoulos, Apostolos; Athanasiadis, Apostolos; Pearson, Rebecca; Papazisis, Georgios",J Perinat Med,,404
499477,Medical Education Adaptations: Really Good Stuff for educational transition during a pandemic,2020,"Viruses need to hijack the translational machinery of the host cell for a productive infection to happen. However, given the dynamic landscape of tRNA pools among tissues, it is unclear whether different viruses infecting different tissues have adapted their codon usage toward their tropism. Here, we collect the coding sequences of 502 human-infecting viruses and determine that tropism explains changes in codon usage. Using the tRNA abundances across 23 human tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we build an in silico model of translational efficiency that validates the correspondence of the viral codon usage with the translational machinery of their tropism. For instance, we detect that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is specifically adapted to the upper respiratory tract and alveoli. Furthermore, this correspondence is specifically defined in early viral proteins. The observed tissue-specific translational efficiency could be useful for the development of antiviral therapies and vaccines.","Hernandez-Alias, Xavier; Benisty, Hannah; Schaefer, Martin H; Serrano, Luis",Cell Rep,,404

502112,Peer teaching medical students during a pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a major concern when starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) in patients with advanced HIV infection. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and risk factors of IRIS in HIV-infected Koreans initiating ART, and whether integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) treatment increases the risk of IRIS. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included adults living with HIV, seen at four university-affiliated hospitals in South Korea, who were naïve to ART and had a CD4 T-cell count < 200 cells/µL between January 2004 and May 2019. IRIS was determined through a medical record review within 6 months of ART initiation. Propensity score-matched case-control study between the non-INSTI and INSTI groups was performed. RESULTS: The study included 501 patients; 192 were assigned to the INSTI group, who started ART based on INSTIs as the initial treatment. There were opportunistic infections (OIs) in 253 (50.5%) cases before ART initiation. The three most common OIs were Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, candidiasis and tuberculosis (TB). We identified 47 cases of IRIS; TB-IRIS was the most common type. The incidence of IRIS within 6 months of ART initiation was 9.4%, and there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics and incidence of IRIS between the matched groups. The risk factors for IRIS were pre-ART CD4 T-cell count (< 30 cells/µL), higher pre-ART viral load (&#8805; 75 000 copies/mL), and TB-OI. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of IRIS was 9.4% in Korean HIV patients. The INSTI regimen was not related to IRIS occurrence.","Kim, J; Nam, H-J; Kang, S-J; Jung, S-I; Hwang, C H; Kim, Y-S; Chang, H-H; Kim, S-W; Park, K-Hwa",HIV med,,404

In this study, we aimed to determine the role of environmental factors, such as climate and air pollutants, in the transmission of COVID-19 in the Republic of Korea. We collected epidemiological and environmental data from two regions of the Republic of Korea, namely Seoul metropolitan region (SMR) and Daegu-Gyeongbuk region (DGR) from February 2020 to July 2020. The data was then analyzed to identify correlations between each environmental factor with confirmed daily COVID-19 cases. Among the various environmental parameters, the duration of sunshine and ozone level were found to positively correlate with COVID-19 cases in both regions. However, the association of temperature variables with COVID-19 transmission revealed contradictory results when comparing the data from SMR and DGR. Moreover, statistical bias may have arisen due to an extensive epidemiological investigation and altered socio-behaviors that occurred in response to a COVID-19 outbreak. Nevertheless, our results suggest that various environmental factors may play a role in COVID-19 transmission.","Lim, Yong Kwan; Kweon, Oh Joo; Kim, Hye Ryoun; Kim, Tae-Hyoung; Lee, Mi-Kyung",Sci Rep,,404

Hereby, the most profitable medicines can be suggested. METHODS: The mesh terms of ""COVID-19 drug treatment"" (Supplementary Concept) and ""COVID-19 drug treatment"" were sequentially utilized as search strategies in Medline and Science direct on October 18, 2020. Searches were confined to systematic reviews/meta-analyses. The Cochrane database was searched on November 1, 2020 with ""COVID."" With adding up four articles from other resources, 84 systematic reviews were considered for initial screening. Finally, 22 articles fulfilled the criteria and were assessed using PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: Increasing number of clinical trials from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are not only profitable but also deleterious. Lopinavir/ritonavir failed to maintain their initial efficacy in improving clinical symptoms and mortality rate. Steroids and tocilizumab were suggested in patients with intensely severe symptoms. Steroids reduced mechanical ventilation and death in severely ill patients. Plasma or immunoglobulins effects are absolutely controversial. Favorable impressions of remdesivir have been relied on for the early onset of this drug. Hypotension and abnormal liver function tests were realized as its side effects. Favipiravir has resulted in a higher viral clearance than remdesivir. However, this claim needs to be proved with subsequent clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, remdesivir and favipiravir are advantageous drugs that should be administered in the early phases. Their side effects are not well known and need to be found in the following research projects. Steroids and tocilizumab have been considered beneficial in the cytokine storm phase.","Kheirabadi, Dorna; Haddad, Fatemeh; Mousavi-Roknabadi, Razieh S; Rezaeisadrabadi, Mohammad; Dehghan, Hamidreza; Fazlzadeh, Aylar",J Med Virol,,404

506225,Government actions against the new coronavirus: evidence from the Brazilian states,2020,"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the recognized host cell receptor responsible for mediating infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). ACE2 bound to tissue facilitates infectivity of SARS-CoV-2; thus, one could argue that decreasing ACE2 tissue expression would be beneficial. However, ACE2 catalytic activity towards angiotensin I (Ang I) and II (Ang II) mitigates deleterious effects associated with activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) on several organs, including a pro-inflammatory status. At the tissue level, SARS-CoV-2 (a) binds to ACE2, leading to its internalization, and (b) favors ACE2 cleavage to form soluble ACE2: these actions result in decreased ACE2 tissue levels. Preserving tissue ACE2 activity while preventing ACE2 shredding is expected to circumvent unrestrained inflammatory response. Concerns have been raised around RAAS modulators and their effects on ACE2 expression or catalytic activity. Various cellular and animal models report conflicting results in various tissues. However, recent data from observational and meta-analysis studies in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients have concluded that RAAS modulators do not increase plasma ACE2 levels or susceptibility to infection and are not associated with more severe diseases. This review presents our current but evolving knowledge of the complex interplay between SARS-CoV-2 infection, ACE2 levels, modulators of RAAS activity and the effects of RAAS modulators on ACE2 expression.","Michaud, Veronique; Deodhar, Malavika; Arwood, Meghan; Al Rihani, Sweilem B.; Dow, Pamela; Turgeon, Jacques",J.

Here, we review the literature on these complications, ranging from nonspecific symptoms to necrotizing encephalopathies, encephalitis, myelitis, encephalomyelitis, endotheliitis, and stroke. We postulate that there are several different mechanisms involved in COVID-19-associated CNS dysfunction, particularly activation of inflammatory and thrombotic pathways and, in a few patients, a direct viral effect on the endothelium and the parenchyma. Last, critically ill patients frequently present with protracted cognitive dysfunction in the setting of septic encephalopathy likely due to multifactorial mechanisms. Further studies are needed to clarify the relative contribution of each of these mechanisms, but available data suggest that CNS complications in COVID-19 are rare and probably not directly caused by the virus.","Bodro, Marta; Compta, Yaroslau; Sánchez-Valle, Raquel",,,404

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the course of experiments, the cytotoxic properties of enisamium iodide were studied against the cell lines Vero, MA-104, A549, L-41 and HEp-2. The antiviral activity of enisamium iodide was studied using virus yield reduction assay against influenza viruses, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, Coxsackie B3 and Coxsackie B4 viruses, as well as adenoviruses types 5 and 6. RESULTS: The most sensitive to the action of enisamium iodide was the human parainfluenza virus, whose activity decreased by 2.3 orders of magnitude under the action of the drug in A549 cells. Of the cell cultures used, enisamium iodide exhibited the maximum antiviral effect in human lung carcinoma cells A549, where, in its presence, the level of reproduction of adenoviruses of types 5 and 6, Coxsackie viruses B3 and B4, and human parainfluenza virus decreased by an order of magnitude or more. The antiviral activity of enisamium iodide was least manifested in Vero cells. CONCLUSION: According to the results of in vitro experiments, enisamium iodide can be considered as an antiviral drug with a wide spectrum of activity against human respiratory viruses.","Zarubaev, V V; Slita, A V; Sinegubova, E O; Muryleva, A A; Lavrentieva, I N",Ter Arkh,,404

Fortunately, there has been significant progress in the production of vaccines to stem the infection. However, with controversies and myths surrounding vaccinations, it is timely to examine individuals' willingness to vaccinate. The present study adapted the Motors of Influenza Vaccination Acceptance Scale (MoVac-Flu Scale) into the Motors of COVID-19 Vaccination Acceptance Scale (MoVac-COVID19S) for validation and assessed the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination utilizing the cognitive model of empowerment (CME). METHODS: A total of 3145 university students (mean age = 20.80 years; SD = 2.09) were recruited for the present study between January 5 and 16, 2021. Two MoVac-COVID19S scales (9-item and 12-item) were adapted from the MoVac-Flu Scale, an instrument developed using CME. Psychometric tests were conducted to ascertain reliability and validity properties. RESULTS: The findings indicated that the MoVac-COVID19S had high internal consistency in both the 9-item version (&#969; = 0.921) and 12-item version (&#969; = 0.898). The factor structure of the MoVac-COVID19S (9-item and 12-item versions) corresponded well with CME theory. All the fit indices were satisfactory (comparative fit index = 0.984, Tucker-Lewis index = 0.971, root mean square error of approximation = 0.088, standardized root mean square residual = 0.058) but the 9-item MoVac-COVID had better fit indices than the 12-item MoVac-COVID due to the negative wording effects existing in the 12-item MoVac-COVID19S. The scale had satisfactory known-group validity in both 9-item and 12-item versions. CONCLUSIONS: The MoVac-COVID19S has promising psychometric properties based on internal consistency, factor structure, and known-group validity.","Chen, I-Hua; Ahorsu, Daniel Kwasi; Ko, Nai-Ying; Yen, Cheng-Fang; Lin, Chung-Ying; Griffiths, Mark D; Pakpour, Amir H",Vaccine,,404

However, due to the smallness and variety of lung nodules and the lack of high-quality labeling, accurate lung nodule segmentation is still a challenging problem. To address these issues, we propose a complete paradigm for accurate lung nodules segmentation. First, we introduce a new segmentation mask named Soft Mask which has richer and more accurate edge details description and better visualization. Correspondingly, we develop a universal semi-automatic Soft Mask annotation pipeline to deal with different datasets. Second, a novel Network with Detailed representation transfer and Soft Mask supervision (DSNet) is proposed to process the input low-resolution images of lung nodules into high-quality segmentation results. In our DSNet, we design a novel Selective Detailed Representation Fusion Module to reconstruct the detailed representation to alleviate the small size of lung nodules images. In addition, the adversarial training framework with Soft Mask is proposed to further improve the accuracy of segmentation. Extensive experiments validate that our DSNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for accurate lung nodules segmentation.

Recent studies revealed that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to that of SARS-CoV. Therefore, herein, we analysed the 3CLpro sequence, constructed its 3D homology model, and screened it against a medicinal plant library containing 32,297 potential anti-viral phytochemicals/traditional Chinese medicinal compounds.

516078,India’s response to covid-19 pandemic and its impact on migrant workers – a public health perspective,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Youth with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) experience high rates of psychiatric comorbidities, which may affect medication adherence. We examined the association between psychiatric disorders and hydroxychloroquine adherence and determined whether psychiatric treatment modifies this association. METHODS: We identified incident hydroxychloroquine users among youth with SLE (ages 10-24 years) using de-identified U.S. commercial insurance claims in Optum Clinformatics® Data Mart (2000-2016). Adherence was estimated using medication possession ratios (MPR) over a 365-day interval. Multivariable linear regression models were used to estimate the effect of having any psychiatric disorder on MPR, as well as the independent effects of depression, anxiety, adjustment and other psychiatric disorders. We tested for interactions between psychiatric diagnoses and treatment with psychotropic medications or psychotherapy. RESULTS: Among 873 subjects, 20% had a psychiatric diagnosis, most commonly depression. Only adjustment disorders were independently associated with decreased MPRs (ß -0.12, p=0.05). We observed significant crossover interactions, in which psychiatric disorders had opposite effects on adherence depending on the receipt of psychiatric treatment. Among youth with any psychiatric diagnosis, psychotropic medication use was associated with a 0.15 increase in MPR compared with no psychotropic medication (p=0.02 for interaction). Among youth with depression or anxiety, psychotherapy was also associated with a higher MPR compared with no psychotherapy (p=0.05 and p<0.01 for interaction, respectively). CONCLUSION: The impact of psychiatric disorders on medication adherence differed by whether youth had received psychiatric treatment. Improving recognition and treatment of psychiatric conditions may increase adherence in youth with SLE.","Chang, Joyce C; Davis, Alaina M; Klein-Gitelman, Marisa S; Cidav, Zuleyha; Mandell, David S; Knight, Andrea M",Arthritis care &amp; research (2010 : Online),,404

We sought to investigate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cardiac injury and hypertension during the current coronavirus pandemic. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The clinical data of 366 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients were analyzed. The clinical signs and laboratory findings were extracted from electronic medical records. Two independent, experienced clinicians reviewed and analyzed the data. RESULTS: Cardiac injury was found in 11.19% (30/268) of enrolled patients. 93.33% (28/30) of cardiac injury cases were in the severe group. The laboratory findings indicated that white blood cells, neutrophils, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, lactate, and lactic dehydrogenase were positively associated with cardiac injury marker. Compared with healthy controls, the 190 patients without prior hypertension have higher Angâ ¡ level, of which 16 (8.42%) patients had a rise in blood pressure to the diagnostic criteria of hypertension during hospitalization, with a significantly increased level of the cTnI, procalcitonin, angiotensin-II (Angâ ¡) than those normal blood pressure ones. Multivariate analysis indicated that elevated age, cTnI, the history of hypertension, and diabetes were independent predictors for illness severity. The predictive model, based on the four parameters and gender, has a good ability to identify the clinical severity of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients (area under the curve: 0.932, sensitivity: 98.67%, specificity: 75.68%). CONCLUSION: Hypertension, sometimes accompanied by elevated cTnI, may occur in COVID-19 patients and become a sequela. Enhancing Ang II signaling, driven by SARS-CoV-2 infection, might play an important role in the renin-angiotensin system, and consequently lead to the development of hypertension in COVID-19.","Chen, Ganxiao; Li, Xun; Gong, Zuojiong; Xia, Hao; Wang, Yao; Wang, Xuefen; Huang, Yan; Barajas-Martinez, Hector; Hu, Dan",PLoS One,,404

Large scale lockdown of human movements are effective in reducing the spread, but they come at a cost of significantly limited societal functions. We show that natural human movements are statistically diverse, and the spread of the disease is significantly influenced by a small group of active individuals and gathering venues. We find that interventions focused on these most mobile individuals and popular venues reduce both the peak infection rate and the total infected population while retaining high social activity levels. These trends are seen consistently in simulations with real human mobility data of different scales, resolutions, and modalities from multiple cities across the world. The observation implies that compared to broad sweeping interventions, more heterogeneous strategies that are targeted based on the network effects in human mobility provide a better balance between pandemic control and regular social activities.","Wang, Haotian; Ghosh, Abhirup; Ding, Jiaxin; Sarkar, Rik; Gao, Jie",Sci Rep,,404

In the last 6 months, SARS-CoV-2 has caused millions of reported cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths. As other world regions, South America has not contained the pandemic's advance since it lacks the hospital and economic capacities. Public health implications of transmission, while the asymptomatic/presymptomatic infection is a critical concern at the current pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Describe the socio-demographic, clinical, and viral features of a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals from the Colombian Caribbean. METHODS: Six hundred eighty-six clinical samples of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection cases and contacts individuals from several hospital centers in the department of Córdoba, Colombia, were received at our laboratory between April 9th and May 16th, 2020. RNA was extracted using lysis buffers and spin columns. The samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) using commercially available multiplex real-time PCR assay for simultaneous detection of 3 target genes of SARS-CoV-2 (Allplex&#8482;, 2019-nCoV assay, Korea). Viral copies quantification was done using a standard curve constructed from seriated dilutions of a SARS-CoV-2 positive control. Statics descriptive methods were used. RESULTS: Thirty-five nasopharyngeal samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection; the average age was 43 (range, 1-95 years). Seventeen of 35 (49%) of the patients showed symptoms. Most of them had a cough, fever, and odynophagia; three of the patients reported having arthralgia. Only two patients required hospitalization. None of the patients had known co-morbidities. RT-qPCR results show that two of the symptomatic patients had significantly higher RNA copies than the rest. Eighteen of 35 (51%) individuals were asymptomatic, and the average age was 30 (range, 6-61 years). Four asymptomatic individuals showed a higher copy than some symptomatic patients; nonetheless, the average of RNA copies 8.26 × 1010 was lower than the symptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that asymptomatic patients may develop infections with a high number of RNA copies. Since a considerable percentage of infections may be asymptomatic/presymptomatic, enhanced testing approaches may be needed to detect these persons. Due the occurrence of a large proportion of infections being a result from transmission originated in asymptomatic/presymptomatic individuals, public health interventions in Colombia should be based on two steps: a massive molecular screening, and viral load quantification. Finally, a remarkable issue in our study is the average age of symptomatic and asymptomatic groups (43 and 30 respectively) which may be important because of the economic impact that has been caused by the coronavirus pandemic and may be probably the cause of the reduced lethality observed in the country and the department at the time of this study.","Mattar, Salim; Martinez-Bravo, Caty; Rivero, Ricardo; Contreras, Héctor; Faccini-Martínez, Álvaro A; Guzman-Teran, Camilo; Galeano, Ketty; Alvis-Guzman, Nelson; Contreras, Verónica; Arrieta, German; Gonzalez-Tous, Marco; Miranda, Jorge; Ospina, Martha; Camargo-Assis, Francisco; Mercado-Reyes, Marcela; Garay, Evelyn; Garcia-Perez, Alejandra; Lopez, Yesica; Tique, Vaneza",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,,404

Our aim is to investigate the prevalence of anxiety in medical students during this pandemic. This systematic review and mini meta-analysis has been conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Two researchers independently searched PubMed on 26 August 2020 for cross-sectional studies on medical students during the COVID-19 outbreak, with no language restrictions applied. We then performed a manual search to detect other potentially eligible investigations. To the 1361 records retrieved in the initial search, 4 more were added by manual search on medRxiv. Finally, eight studies were finally included for qualitative and quantitative analysis, which yielded an estimated prevalence of anxiety of 28% (95% CI: 22–34%), with significant heterogeneity between studies. The prevalence of anxiety in medical students is similar to that prior to the pandemic but correlates with several specific COVID-related stressors. While some preventive and risk factors have been previously identified in a non-pandemic context, knowledge and cognitions on COVID-19 transmission, treatment, prognosis and prevention negatively correlate with anxiety, emerging as a key preventive factor that may provide a rationale for why the levels of anxiety have remained stable in medical students during the pandemic while increasing in their non-medical peers and the general population.

596546,Optimizing Remote Learning: Leveraging Zoom to Develop and Implement Successful Education Sessions,2021-06-28,"BACKGROUND: Chronic lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are linked to several mitochondrial alterations. Cigarette smoke (CS) alters the structure and function of mitochondria. OPA1 is the main inner mitochondrial GTPase responsible for the fusion events. OPA1 undergoes proteolytic cleavage from long to short forms during acute stress and mitophagy. However, the exact role of OPA1 isoforms and related proteins during CS-induced mitophagy and COPD is not clear. METHODS: Lung tissues from non-smokers, smokers, COPD and IPF were used to determine the relative expression of OPA1 and related proteins. Additionally, we used mouse lungs from chronic (6 months) CS exposure to evaluate the status of OPA1. Primary lung fibroblasts from normal and COPD patients and naked mole rat (NMR) lung fibroblasts, human fetal lung fibroblast (HFL1), mouse embryonic fibroblast from wild type (WT), OPA1(−/−), MFN1 and MFN2(−/−) were used to determine the effect of CS on OPA1 isoforms. Various mitochondrial fusion promoters/activators (BGP-15, leflunomide, M1) and fission inhibitor (DRP1) were used to determine their effect on OPA1 status and cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced lung epithelial (BEAS2B) cell damage, respectively. Seahorse flux analyzer was used to determine the effect of these compounds in BEAS2B cells with and without CSE exposure. FINDINGS: Short OPA1 isoforms were predominantly detected and significantly increased in COPD subjects. Acute CSE treatment in various cell lines except NMR was found to increase the conversion of long to short OPA1 isoforms. CSE treatment significantly increased mitochondrial stress-related protein SLP2 in all the cells used. OPA1 interacting partners like prohibitins (PHB1 and 2) were also altered depending on the CS exposure. Finally, BGP-15 and leflunomide treatment were able to preserve the long OPA1 isoform in cells treated with CSE. INTERPRETATION/CONCLUSION: The long OPA1 isoform along with SLP2 and prohibitins play a crucial role in CS-induced lung damage, causing mitophagy/mitochondrial dysfunction in COPD, which may be used as a novel therapeutic target in COPD.","Maremanda, Krishna Prahlad; Sundar, Isaac Kirubakaran; Rahman, Irfan",Redox Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34214709/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2021.102055,404

We present a consecutive retrospective COVID-19 cohort with findings of frequent pulmonary thromboembolism (17%), high pulmonary artery pressure (60%) and lung MRI perfusion disturbances. We demonstrate, in swine, that infusing angiotensin II or blocking ACE2 induces increased pulmonary artery pressure, reduces blood oxygenation, increases coagulation, disturbs lung perfusion, induces diffuse alveolar damage, and acute tubular necrosis compared to control animals. We further demonstrate that this imbalanced state can be ameliorated by infusion of an angiotensin receptor blocker and low-molecular-weight heparin. In this work, we show that a pathophysiological state in swine induced by RAAS imbalance shares several features with the clinical COVID-19 presentation.

We performed a retrospective analysis of this visual score to determine its sensitivity and specificity. The study included all cases from 2014 to 2017 in a MERS-CoV referral centre in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. During the study period there were a total of 2435 suspected MERS cases. Of these, 1823 (75%) tested negative and the remaining 25% tested positive for MERS-CoV by PCR assay. The application of the visual triage score found a similar percentage of MERS-CoV and non–MERS-CoV patients, with each score from 0 to 11. The percentage of patients with a cutoff score of ≥4 was 75% in patients with MERS-CoV infection and 85% in patients without MERS-CoV infection (p 0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity of this cutoff score for MERS-CoV infection were 74.1% and 18.6%, respectively.

The COVID− 19 taskforce within the Ghent University hospital made use of ten-day forecasts on the required number of beds for COVID− 19 patients across different wards. METHODS: The planning tool combined a Poisson model for the number of newly admitted patients on each day with a multistate model for the transitions of admitted patients to the different wards, discharge or death. These models were used to simulate the required capacity of beds by ward type over the next 10 days, along with worst-case and best-case bounds. RESULTS: Overall, the models resulted in good predictions of the required number of beds across different hospital wards. Short-term predictions were especially accurate as these are less sensitive to sudden changes in number of beds on a given ward (e.g. due to referrals). Code snippets and details on the set-up are provided to guide the reader to apply the planning tool on one’s own hospital data.

In this study, we report an unusual case of primary CMV infection wherein the patient, an immunocompetent 21-year-old woman, presented severe encephalopathy, acute hepatitis, retinitis, and reactivation of latent Epstein–Barr virus. She developed confusion, high fever, headache, and tonic-clonic seizures. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed high-intensity lesions in the medial temporal lobe and basal ganglia. Liver dysfunction was observed, and abdominal computed tomography revealed splenohepatomegaly. After fundus findings, the patient was diagnosed with CMV retinitis. Upon admission, she was treated with intravenous acyclovir and steroid pulse therapy. Considering both her serious clinical condition and elevated serum levels of interleukin-6, we speculated that her condition was similar to cytokine-storm-induced encephalopathy. On day 2 after admission, she showed prompt recovery from these clinical manifestations. Since blood CMV pp65 antigenemia was found to be positive, we administered ganciclovir for 2 weeks. On the basis of her clinical manifestations and the presence of blood CMV DNA and CMV pp65 antigenemia along with IgM kinetics, we finally diagnosed this patient with severe primary CMV infection. She left our hospital without sequelae 20 days after admission. The incidence of severe CMV disease in immunocompetent young adults might be higher than previously recognized. Noninvasive testing for CMV (such as CMV pp65 antigenemia and CMV DNAemia) is widely available and can help early diagnosis. Short-term glucocorticoid therapy might be beneficial in the treatment of encephalopathy in the early stages of primary CMV infection. Considering such a background, clinicians should keep severe primary CMV infection in mind as a differential diagnosis in the clinical setting.","Tetsuka, Syuichi; Suzuki, Tomohiro; Ogawa, Tomoko; Hashimoto, Ritsuo; Kato, Hiroyuki",Case Rep Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5589739; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34188964/,404

In older western populations the high prevalence and impact of micronutrient malnutrition is less well recognised. Low- and middle-income countries are experiencing the 'double burden of disease' where malnutrition coexists alongside the non-communicable diseases of aging, obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Held in December 2020, the Winter Conference of the Nutrition Society was designed to cover new areas of research and concern in micronutrient malnutrition across the life course. Common themes arising from the conference were: 1) The continuing high prevalence of micronutrient malnutrition across the life-course, in diverse populations, in high, middle and low-income countries. 2) That multiple deficiencies of micronutrients frequently exist. 3) The primary cause of deficiency is poor quality diets, of low diversity, low in micronutrient dense foods. 4) Clinical conditions, medications for common non-communicable diseases, and environmental conditions, interact with and exacerbate the effects of poor diet quality. 5) Understanding of the mechanistic effects of micronutrients is still emerging. 6) Micronutrients are necessary for maintaining immune function, which has importance for the COVID-19 epidemic. 7) Better biomarkers are needed detect and understand the effects of deficiency. 7) Dietary recommendations need to be updated regularly. Further research is needed in all these areas.

Objective We sought to demonstrate the utility of e-consults in allergy/immunology (A/I) inpatient consultations. Methods Inpatients ≥ 18 years of age for whom an A/I consultation was requested were eligible for an e-consult. An e-consult was completed if considered appropriate by the A/I physician with recommendations made in the EHR. In-person consultation was performed for inpatients if deemed necessary. Likert scale satisfaction data was collected from requesting providers after the e-consultation. Cost was calculated using time-based billing codes plus the cost of penicillin allergy evaluation, if appropriate. Results Of the 109 inpatient consults, 78 (71.6%) were completed through an e-consult, and 31 (28.4%) were completed by an in-person consult. The most common indication for inpatient consult was evaluation of penicillin allergy in 73 (67%) patients. The most common reason to complete an in-person consult was the need to complete penicillin skin testing in 17 of the 31 (55%) patients. E-consults were completed in less time than in-person consults (15 minutes [IQR: 10 to 15], versus 60 minutes [IQR: 45 to 60], p < 0.001 and had a shorter turnaround time (1 hour [IQR: 0.5 to 2], versus 7 hours [IQR: 3 to 19], p < 0.001. Management recommendations were followed at a similar rate regardless of type of consult (88% of e-consults versus 96% of in-person consults, p=0.162). 97% of requesting providers reported an “excellent” or “good” impression of e-consults. E-consults were less costly than in-person consults. Conclusions E-consults have utility in providing inpatient allergy/immunology consultation, and may have advantages over in-person evaluation, while adequately maintaining provider satisfaction.","Mustafa, S.

METHODS: A survey was emailed to all ESNR members and associates as well as distributed via professional social media channels. The survey was held in the summer of 2020 when the first wave had subsided in most of Europe, while the second wave was not yet widespread. The questionnaire featured a total of 46 questions on general demographics, the various phases of the healthcare crisis, and the numbers of Covid-19 patients. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-seven responses were received from 48 countries mostly from neuroradiologists (72%). Most commonly taken measures during the crisis phase were reduction of outpatient exams (87%), reduction of number of staff present in the department (83%), reporting from home (62%), and shift work (54%). In the exit phase, these measures were less frequently applied, but reporting from home was still frequent (33%). However, only 22% had access to a fully equipped work station at home. While 81% felt safe at work during the crisis, fewer than 50% had sufficient personal protection equipment for the duration of the entire crisis. Mental wellbeing is an area of concern, with 61% feeling (much) worse than usual. Many followed online courses/congresses and considered these a viable alternative for the future.

The test-negative design (TND) case-control study is commonly used to obtain IVE estimates. However, the definition of the control patients may influence IVE estimates. We have conducted a TND study using the Dutch Sentinel Practices of NIVEL Primary Care Database which includes data from patients who consulted the General Practitioner (GP) for an episode of acute influenza-like illness (ILI) or acute respiratory infection (ARI) with known influenza vaccination status. Cases were patients tested positive for influenza virus. Controls were grouped into those who tested (1) negative for influenza virus (all influenza negative), (2) negative for influenza virus, but positive for respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus or enterovirus (non-influenza virus positive), and (3) negative for these four viruses (pan-negative). We estimated the IVE over all epidemic seasons from 2003/2004 through 2013/2014, pooled IVE for influenza vaccine partial/full matched and mismatched seasons and the individual seasons using generalized linear mixed-effect and multiple logistic regression models. The overall IVE adjusted for age, GP ILI/ARI diagnosis, chronic disease and respiratory allergy was 35% (95% CI: 15–48), 64% (95% CI: 49–75) and 21% (95% CI: −1 to 39) for all influenza negative, non-influenza virus positive and pan-negative controls, respectively. In both the main and subgroup analyses IVE estimates were the highest using non-influenza virus positive controls, likely due to limiting inclusion of controls without laboratory-confirmation of a virus causing the respiratory disease.","van Doorn, Eva; Darvishian, Maryam; Dijkstra, Frederika; Donker, Gé A.; Overduin, Pieter; Meijer, Adam; Hak, Eelko",Vaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28412077/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X17304760; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X17304760; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.04.012,404

While IgG responses against SARS-CoV-2 have been characterized quite well, less is known about IgA. IgA2 activates immune cells and induces inflammation and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation which may contribute to organ injury and fatal outcome in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein specific antibody levels were measured in plasma samples of 15 noninfected controls and 82 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with no or mild symptoms, moderate symptoms (hospitalization) or severe disease (intensive care unit, ICU). Antibody levels were compared to levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and circulating extracellular DNA (ecDNA) as markers for general inflammation and NET formation, respectively. While levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG were similar in all patient groups, IgA2 antibodies were restricted to severe disease and showed the strongest discrimination between nonfatal and fatal outcome in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. While anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA2 levels correlated with CRP levels in severely diseased patients, only anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA2 correlated with ecDNA. These data suggest that the formation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA2 during SARS-CoV-2 infection is a marker for more severe disease related to NET formation and poor outcome.","Staats, Léonie A.

In addition to the direct risk, obesity triggers other diseases such as diabetes and hypertension, increasing the risk of severe COVID-19. The present review explains the diets that induce obesity and the importance of different foods in this process. We also review tissue disruption in obesity, leading to impaired immune responses and the possible mechanisms by which obesity and its co-morbidities increase COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

This study assesses the availability and self-reported use of PPE amongst HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. A mixed-method study was conducted through a cross-sectional survey and in-depth interviews amongst HCW. Quantitative data analysis was done using SPSS version 26 and thematic analysis was done for the in-depth interview. A total of 258 HCW completed the survey while 15 HCW took part in the in-depth interview. The mean age was 40 (±8.6) years, 67.4% were female and 83.3% were married. 49% were Doctors, 21.1% were Nurses, 28.7% were other allied HCW and 62.2% had at least 10 years of practice experience.

Male HCWs and those working at secondary or tertiary facilities had access to N-95 facemask (p-value 0.025 and 0.010 respectively). The facilitator of PPE use is leadership quality of hospital head and donation of PPE to the facilities while the barriers to PPE use include a limited supply of PPE, as well as facility’s infrastructural and operational challenges. The study reported limited access to essential PPE with varying perspectives on its use. Therefore, access, knowledge, and appropriate use of PPE need urgent attention with improved implementation of infection control policy at the facility level.","Oladele, David Ayoola; Idigbe, Ifeoma Eugenia; Musa, Adesola Zaidat; Gbajabiamila, Titilola; Bamidele, Tajudeen; Ohihoin, Aigbe Gregory; Salako, Abideen; Odubela, Tosin; Aina, Oluwagbemiga; Ohihoin, Esther; David, Agatha; Ezechi, Oliver; Odunukwe, Nkiruka; Salako, Babatunde Lawal",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34031646/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844021012032?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405844021012032; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07100,404

Possible evolutionary processes for such relationships include mutant lineages escaping host control or diversity, per se, creating too many immune system targets. Another possibility is social heterosis where mutations and replicative errors create clonal lineages varying in intrinsic capability for successful dispersal; improved environmental buffering; resource extraction or effective defence against immune systems. Rather than these capabilities existing in one genome, social heterosis proposes complementary synergies occur across lineages in close proximity. Diverse groups overcome host defences as interacting ‘social genomes’ with group genetic tool kits exceeding limited individual plasticity. To assess the possibility of social heterosis in viral infections and cancer progression, we conducted extensive literature searches for examples consistent with general and specific predictions from the social heterosis hypothesis. Numerous studies found supportive patterns in cancers across multiple tissues and in several families of RNA viruses. In viruses, social heterosis mechanisms probably result from long coevolutionary histories of competition between pathogen and host. Conversely, in cancers, social heterosis is a by-product of recent mutations. Investigating how social genomes arise and function in viral quasi-species swarms and cancer tumours may lead to new therapeutic approaches.","Ebrahimi, Saba; Nonacs, Peter",Royal Society open science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34035948/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.202219,404

Analytical studies reported high specificity yet with lower sensitivity for detecting SARS-CoV-2 compared to qRT-PCR. Here, we present the use of these tests as a decision support tool in several settings. Methods: Samples were collected for both Ag-RDT and qRT-PCR in three different clinical settings; 1. Symptomatic patients presenting at the Emergency Departments 2. Asymptomatic patients screened upon hospitalization and 3. Health-care workers (HCW) following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. To estimate the association between Ct value, Ag-RDT and the number of days since SARS-CoV-2 exposure or symptomatic COVID-19, a mixed model was applied. Results: A total of 5172 samples were obtained from 4595 individuals, with Ag-RDT and qRT-PCR results. Of these, 485 samples were positive by qRT-PCR. The PPA of Ag-RDT was greater for lower Ct values, reaching 93% in cases where Ct value was lower than 25 and 85% where Ct value was lower than 30. PPA was similar between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The NPV and PPV were 96.8% and 99.1%, respectively. We observed a significant correlation between Ct value and time from infection onset (p<0.001). Lower Ct values were significantly associated with a positive Ag-RDT (p=0.01). Conclusions: Ag-RDT can be used as a decision support tool in various clinical settings and play a major role in early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, highly specific and with high sensitivity to the infectious stage of disease, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic.","Regev-Yochay, G.; Kriger, O.; Beni, S.; Rubin, C.; Mina, M.

In this short report, we estimate mortality rates among street-connected young people in an urban setting in Kenya and calculate standardized mortality ratios to assess excess mortality among street-connected young people compared to the general population of Kenyan adolescents. We collected data on deaths among street-connected young people aged 0–29 between 2010 and 2015. We calculated sex-stratified standardized mortality ratios for street-connected young people aged 0–19 and 20–29 from 2010 to 2015, using publicly available Kenya population data as reference. We found that between 2010 and 2015, there were 69 deaths among street-connected young people aged 0 to 29 years in 2013 was 1,248: 341 females (27%) and 907 males (73%). The standardized mortality ratios among street-connected females aged 0–19 and 20–29 years were 2.79 (95% CI 1.44–4.88) and 7.55 (95% CI 3.77–13.51), respectively; standardized mortality ratios among street-connected males aged 0–19 and 20–29 years were 0.71 (95% CI 0.32–1.35) and 5.48 (95% CI 3.86–7.55), respectively. In conclusion, we found that mortality among street-connected young people in an urban setting in Kenya is elevated compared to the general population of Kenyan young people. States should act urgently and take responsibility for protecting street-connected young people’s human rights by scaling up programs to prevent morbidity and death associated with youth street involvement.","Kibel, Mia; Pierzchalski, James; Gorfinkel, Lauren; Embleton, Lonnie; Ayuku, David; Hogg, Robert; Braitstein, Paula",Global health action,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32819217/; https://doi.org/10.1080/16549716.2020.1802097,404

The use of 3D files in medical education is promoted, but only few methodologies were reported due to the lack of ease to use and accessible protocols for educators. The aim of this work was to present innovative and accessible methodologies to create 3D files in dental education. The first step requires the definition of the educational outcomes and the situations of interest. The second step relies on the use of IOS and CBCT to digitize the content. The last “post-treatment” steps involve free software for analysis of quality, re-meshing and simplifying the file in accordance with the desired educational activity. Several examples of educational activities using 3D files are illustrated in dental education and discussed. Three-dimensional files open up many accessible applications for a dental educator, but further investigations are required to develop collaborative tools and prevent educational inequalities between establishments.","Barour, Sabira; Richert, Raphaël; Virard, François; Wulfman, Claudine; Iozzino, Régis; Elbashti, Mahmoud; Naveau, Adrien; Ducret, Maxime",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33562418/; https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9020178,404

642125,Tonic pupil after COVID 19 infection,2021-05-12,"BACKGROUND: Quantifying occupational risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers can inform efforts to improve healthcare worker and patient safety and reduce transmission. This study aimed to quantify demographic, occupational, and community risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among healthcare workers in a large metropolitan healthcare system. METHODS: We analyzed data from a cross-sectional survey conducted from April through June of 2020 linking risk factors for occupational and community exposure to COVID-19 with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. A multivariable logistic regression model was fit to quantify risk factors for infection. Participants were employees and medical staff members who elected to participate in SARS-CoV-2 serology testing offered to all healthcare workers as part of a quality initiative, and who completed a survey on exposure to COVID-19 and use of personal protective equipment. Exposures of interest included known demographic risk factors for COVID-19, residential zip code incidence of COVID-19, occupational exposure to PCR test-positive healthcare workers or patients, and use of personal protective equipment. The primary outcome of interest was SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was estimated to be 5.7% (95% CI: 5.2%−6.1%) among 10,275 healthcare workers. Community contact with a person known or suspected to have COVID-19 (aOR=1.9, 95% CI:1.4–2.5) and zip code level COVID-19 incidence (aOR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0–2.0) increased the odds of infection. Black individuals were at high risk (aOR=2.0, 95% CI:1.6–2.4). Overall, occupational risk factors accounted for 27% (95% CI: 25%−30%) of the risk among healthcare workers and included contact with a PCR test-positive healthcare worker (aOR=1.2, 95% CI:1.0–1.6). CONCLUSIONS: Community risk factors, including contact with a COVID-19 positive individual and residential COVID-19 incidence, are more strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among healthcare workers than exposure in the workplace.","Baker, Julia M.; Nelson, Kristin N.; Overton, Elizabeth; Lopman, Benjamin A.; Lash, Timothy L.; Photakis, Mark; Jacob, Jesse T.; Roback, John; Fridkin, Scott K.; Steinberg, James P.",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.30.20222877v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.30.20222877; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33173904/,404

METHODS: Observational cohort study of hospital workers who received their first SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccination between December 14, 2020 and January 8, 2021, including cases reporting onset of an injection site reaction > 48 hours after administration of their first or second dose to an employee hotline. RESULTS: Thirteen female employees, who received mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV2 vaccine (Moderna) during the first three weeks of SARS-CoV2 vaccine rollout at San Francisco General Hospital, reported a pruritic rash at the injection site appearing 3-9 days after receiving their initial dose. Five had milder or similar reactions with earlier onset after the second dose. One additional female employee reported this delayed reaction only after the second dose. None of these 14 employees reported serious adverse events, such as anaphylaxis, or had symptoms severe enough to seek medical attention. These cases represented 1.1% of the 1,275 female employees who received their first mRNA-1273 dose, and 2.0% of the 557 who were 31-45 years old, during this initial vaccine rollout. None of 675 males initiating mRNA-1273 or 3,612 employees of either sex initiating BNT162b (Pfizer) vaccination during this period reported this delayed onset reaction. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that delayed-onset, injection-site pruritic rashes after mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV2 vaccine administration, lasting up to a week, occur commonly in females, do not lead to serious sequela, and should not deter receipt of the second vaccine dose.","Jacobson, Mark A; Zakaria, Adam; Maung, Zaw; Hart, Colin; McCalmont, Tim; Fassett, Marlys; Amerson, Erin",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34086881/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab518,404

Based on World Health Organization reports, the main source of SARS-CoV-2 infection is transmission of droplets released when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. Viral particles can remain in the air and on the surfaces for a long time. These droplets are too heavy to float in air and rapidly fall down onto the surfaces. To minimize the risk of the infection, entire surrounding environment should be disinfected or neutralized regularly. Development of the antiviral coating for the surface of objects that are frequently used by the public could be a practical route to prevent the spread of the viral particles and inactivation of the transmission of the viruses. In this short review, the design of the antiviral coating to combat the spread of different viruses has been discussed and the technological attempts for minimizing the coronavirus outbreak have been highlighted.","Shirvanimoghaddam, Kamyar; Akbari, Mohammad Karbalaei; Yadav, Ram; Al-Tamimi, Adil K.; Naebe, Minoo",APL Mater,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33842101/; https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0043009,404

Recently, the first COVID-19 vaccines have been authorised, starting a massive vaccination campaign worldwide. The COVID-19 vaccines authorized or under testing use different methods of action such as mRNA, DNA vaccine, viral vector, protein subunit, and virus inactivated immunization strategies. The mRNA vaccines are the first authorised vaccines with this new method of action, initiating a new era of preventive medicine. To date, data indicate that they may be effective against the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 variants.

In this study, we examine the acceptability of DATs to improve adherence to ART. METHODS: This study was part of a three-arm randomized controlled trial (REMIND) which investigated the effect of two different DAT’s: SMS text messages (SMS) or real-time medication monitoring (RTMM) on treatment adherence; compared to standard of care. Exit interviews and in-depth interviews were conducted at 48 weeks follow-up, to collect data on their experiences (successes, challenges, and barriers) and behaviours regarding the implementation of the interventions. Translated transcripts, memos and field notes were imported to NVivo software version 12. We used a thematic framework analysis which drew from Sekhon’s theoretical framework of acceptability (TFA), which comprises of seven constructs (affective attitude, perceived burden, perceived effectiveness, ethicality, self-efficacy, intervention coherence and opportunity costs). RESULTS: Of the 166 participants enrolled, 143 (86%) were interviewed (68 in the SMS arm and 75 in the RTMM arm). Participants were highly satisfied (98%) with the DAT system and the majority of them reported it motivated them to take their medication (99%). The majority of participants reported they were confident in their ability to comply with the intervention and understood how the intervention worked (97%). Very few reported negatively about the devices (carrying the device), with only 6% reporting that they did not feel comfortable and 8% had ethical concerns with the SMS-content A few participants reported challenges with their connectivity/network and that the visits were too time-consuming. A few participants reported that they incurred extra cost for the sake of the study. CONCLUSION: Overall, the acceptability of these DATs was high. However, several factors may hamper their acceptability including the content and number of SMS, carrying the devices and the network availability.","Ngowi, Kennedy; Pima, Francis; Mmbaga, Blandina Theophil; Aarnoutse, Rob E; Reiss, Peter; Nieuwkerk, Pythia T; Sprangers, Mirjam; Sumari-de Boer, Marion",Patient Prefer Adherence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33727801/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ppa.s290079,404

TurboFold II is a state-of-the-art software that can predict conserved structures and alignments given homologous sequences, but its cubic runtime and quadratic memory usage with sequence length prevent it from being applied to most full-length viral genomes. As the COVID-19 outbreak spreads, there is a growing need to have a fast and accurate tool to identify conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2. To address this issue, we present LinearTurboFold, which successfully accelerates TurboFold II without sacrificing accuracy on secondary structure and multiple sequence alignment prediction. LinearTurboFold is orders of magnitude faster than Turbo-Fold II, e.g., 372x faster (12 minutes vs. 3.1 days) on a group of five HIV-1 homologs with average length 9,686 nt. LinearTurboFold is able to scale up to the full sequence of SARS-CoV-2, and identifies conserved structures that have been supported by previous studies. Additionally, LinearTurboFold finds a list of novel conserved regions, including long-range base pairs, which may be useful for better understanding the virus.","Li, Sizhen; Zhang, He; Zhang, Liang; Liu, Kaibo; Liu, Boxiang; Mathews, David H.; Huang, Liang",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.23.393488,404

There is a paucity of information on the predictors and magnitude of response to this treatment. METHODS: In a prospective study, treatment-naive patients with IgAN with urinary protein ≥ 1 g/d and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) received supportive treatment including ACEi (ramipril) or ARB (losartan) in patients intolerant to ACEi, and optimal blood pressure (BP) control to ≤130/80 mm Hg, with a follow-up of 6 months. The primary outcome was remission of proteinuria. Complete remission (CR) was defined as proteinuria < 0.5 g/d and partial remission (PR) as proteinuria < 1g/d with at least a 50% decline from the baseline with stable renal function (≤ 25% reduction in eGFR). RESULTS: A total of 96 patients were analyzed, with a mean age of 33.3 ± 10.2 years, baseline eGFR 74.0 ± 30.9 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), and urinary protein 2.6 ± 1.2 g/d. In all, 71.9% patients received ≥ 75% of the maximum approved dose of ACEi/ARB. Remission was observed in 36.5% (CR, 6.3%) patients at 3 months and in 55.2% (CR, 31.3%) at 6 months. Patients who failed to achieve remission had lower baseline eGFR (P = 0.002) and serum albumin levels (P< 0.001), asymptomatic hyperuricemia (P < 0.001), and higher proteinuria (P = 0.076). E1 (P= 0.053) and T1/T2 (P = 0.009) lesions were more frequent on histology. The ACEi/ARB had to be discontinued in 17 (17.7%) patients. These patients were older (P= 0.085) with lower eGFR (P < 0.002) and serum albumin levels (P = 0.001) and more E1 (P = 0.012) and T1/T2 (P = 0.001) lesions on histology. CONCLUSION: Meticulous supportive therapy with optimal use of ACEi/ARB achieved remission in half of IgAN patients in this study. Increasing the treatment duration to 6 months improved remission rates. Patients with severe clinical and histological disease were less likely to tolerate and respond to treatment with RAS blockade.","Bagchi, Soumita; Mani, Kalaivani; Swamy, Anitha; Barwad, Adarsh; Singh, Geetika; Bhowmik, Dipankar; Agarwal, Sanjay Kumar",Kidney Int Rep,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ekir.2021.02.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34169207/,404

The conserved target sequences directed to classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) were selected based on alignments of genomic sequences and then specific primers were designed. The mRT-PCR assay was developed and evaluated for its specificity and sensitivity. The expected product from the single viral template was amplified by mRT-PCR and no spurious PCR amplification occurred from the genomic RNA or DNA of other pathogens. For single virus or different combinations of two viruses the detection limit of mRT-PCR was consistent with a single RT-PCR wtith 1 × 10(3) copies. For different combinations of the three viruses or four viruses, sensitivity of PEDV detection partially decreased. All of positive clinical specimens by the mRT-PCR were identically confirmed using Taqman RT-qPCR. Therefore, the mRT-PCR is a useful tool for epidemiological studies and laboratory diagnosis of single virus and/or mixed infections in swine.","Zhao, Yan; Liu, Feifei; Li, Qingmei; Wu, Mengfan; Lei, Lei; Pan, Zishu",J Virol Methods,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093419300242; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093419300242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30951787/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2019.04.001,404

Government and school officials are facing challenging decisions on how to start the new 2020/2021 school year. Almost every school system has chosen a remote learning model for the Fall of 2020 while many are facing financial and logistical challenges. In this study, we explore the efficacy of an Active Surveillance testing model where a random number of students are tested daily for early detection of asymptomatic patients and for prevention of the infection among the student population. In addition to health impacts, we also analyze the financial impact of deploying the Active Surveillance system in schools while taking into consideration lost workdays of parents, hospitalization costs, and testing costs. Under the given assumptions, initial modeling results indicate that low Active Surveillance testing rates (between 6-10% daily testing of student population) can help achieve low infection rates ([≤]10%) among students along with enforcing mitigation procedures, such as wearing masks and social distancing. Without enforcing mitigation procedures, the optimal Active Surveillance rate of 8-10% can also achieve ([≤]10%) infection rates among student population. The results also demonstrate that Active Surveillance can lower the financial burden of the pandemic by proactively lowering the infection rates among student populations.","Saad, A.

669809,Construction of 5G all-wireless network and information system for cabin hospitals,2020-05-24,"Tocilizumab is used for treating moderate-severe Covid-19 pneumonia by targeting IL-6 receptors (IL-6R) and reducing cytokine release, but the pooled rate ratio among diabetic patients with adverse vs those with the more favorable course was 2.26. To date, the hyperglycemia has been shown to increase IL-6 and IL-6R, which has been suggested as a severity predictor in lung diseases of Covid-19 patients. However, there are no data about the effects of tocilizumab therapy on outcomes of hyperglycemic Covid-19 patients with pneumonia. To investigate this unsolved need, 475 Covid-19 positive patients were retrospectively studied since March 1st, 2020. Among them, 78 patients with pneumonia disease and treated with tocilizumab were further evaluated for a severe outcome (encompassing both the use of mechanical ventilation and/or death). Thirty-one (39.7%) hyperglycemic and 47 (60.3%) normoglycemic Covid-19 positive patients (blood glucose levels >140 mg/dl, at admission and/or during hospital stay) were evaluated. Noteworthy, 20 (64%) of hyperglycemic and 11 (23.4%) of normoglycemic patients were also diabetics (P<0.01). At admission, more elevated IL-6 levels in hyperglycemic patients were found and persists even after Tocilizumab administration. In a risk adjusted Cox-regression analysis, Tocilizumab in hyperglycemic did not attenuate the risks of severe outcome as did in normoglycemic patients (p<0.009). Therefore, we could conclude that reduced effects of Tocilizumab in hyperglycemic patients may due to the higher plasma IL-6 levels. Interestingly, when we added IL-6 levels in a Cox regression model the significance for the tocilizumab effect was lost (p<0.07). In this context, our observations evidence that optimal Covid-19 infection management with tocilizumab is not achieved during hyperglycemia both in diabetic and non-diabetic patients.","Marfella, R.; Paolisso, P.; Sardu, C.; Bergamaschi, L.; D' Angelo, E.

670418,Terapia vocal no contexto da pandemia do covid-19; orientações para a prática clínica,2020-08-20,"The number of surveillance networks for infectious disease diagnosis and response has been growing. In 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) established the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, which has been endorsed by each of the 46 WHO African members since then. Yet, taming the dynamics and plague of the vicious Ebola virus disease (EVD) in African countries has been patchy and erratic due to inadequate surveillance and contact tracing, community defiance and resistance, a lack of detection and response systems, meager/weak knowledge and information on the disease, inadequacies in protective materials protocols, contact tracing nightmare and differing priorities at various levels of the public health system. Despite the widespread acceptance of syndromic surveillance (SS) systems, their ability to provide early warning alerts and notifications of outbreaks is still unverified. Information is often too limited for any outbreak, or emerging or otherwise unexpected disease, to be recognized at either the community or the national level. Indeed, little is known about the role and the interactions between the Ebola infection and exposure to other syndemics and the development of acquired immunity, asymptomatic reservoir, and Ebola seroconversion. Can lessons be learnt from smallpox, polio, and influenza immunity, and can immunization against these serve as a guide? In most endemic countries, community health centers and disease control and prevention at airports solely relies on passive routine immunization control and reactive syndromic response. The frontline and airport Ebola SS systems in West Africa have shown deficiencies in terms of responding with an alarming number of case fatalities, and suggest that more detailed insights into Ebola, and proactive actions, are needed. The quest for effective early indicators (EEE) in shifting the public and global health paradigm requires the development and implementation of a comprehensive and effective community or regional integrated pandemic preparedness and surveillance response systems tailored to local contexts. These systems must have mechanisms for early identification, rapid contact tracing and tracking, confirmation, and communication with the local population and the global community, and must endeavor to respond in a timely manner.

Given the current lack of an effective vaccine, several drugs have been repurposed for treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19 in an attempt to find an effective cure. AREAS COVERED: The antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) initially garnered widespread attention following the publication of preliminary results showing that this drug exerts an anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro. EXPERT OPINION: To date, clinical evidence suggests lack of benefit from HCQ use for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In such patients, HCQ also appears to be associated with an increased risk of QT interval prolongation and potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, FDA has recently revoked the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for emergency use of HCQ and chloroquine to treat COVID-19. Conversely, whether HCQ use may represent an effective prophylactic strategy against COVID-19 is a separate question that still remains to be answered. In addition, relevant aspects regarding the potential risks and benefits of HCQ need to be clarified, in pursuit of a rational use of this drug in the COVID-19 pandemic era.","Infante, Marco; Ricordi, Camillo; Alejandro, Rodolfo; Caprio, Massimiliano; Fabbri, Andrea",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32693652/; https://doi.org/10.1080/14787210.2020.1799785,404
672141,Curriculum Development with the Implementation of an Open-Source Learning Management System for Training Early Clinical Students: An Educational Design Research Study,2021-01-13,"The severe respiratory distress syndrome linked to the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) includes unbearable dyspneic suffering which contributes to the deterioration of the prognosis of patients in intensive care unit (ICU). Patients are put on mechanical ventilation to reduce respiratory suffering and preserve life. Despite this mechanical ventilation, most patients continue to suffer from dyspnea. Dyspnea is a major source of suffering in intensive care and one of the main factors that affect the prognosis of patients. The development of innovative methods for its management, especially non-drug management is more than necessary. In recent years, numerous studies have shown that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) could modulate the perception of acute or chronic pain. In the other hand, it has been shown that the brain zones activated during pain and dyspnea are close and/or superimposed, suggesting that brain structures involved in the integration of aversive emotional component are shared by these two complex sensory experiences. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that stimulation by tDCS with regard to the areas which, in the case of pain have activated one or more of these brain structures, may also have an effect on dyspnea. In addition, our team recently demonstrated that the application of tDCS on the primary cortical motor area can modulate the excitability of the respiratory neurological pathways. Indeed, tDCS in anodal or cathodal modality reduced the excitability of the diaphragmatic cortico-spinal pathways in healthy subjects. We therefore hypothesized that tDCS could relieve dyspnea in COVID-19 patients under mechanical ventilation in ICU. This study was designed to evaluate effects of two modalities of tDCS (anodal and cathodal) vs. placebo, on the relief of dyspnea in COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation in ICU.

For CRSwNP treatment with T2-addressing biologics is possible. On October 24, 2019, the European Commission granted extended approval for dupilumab as the first biological agent for treatment of insufficiently controlled severe CRSwNP. The Federal Joint Committee (G‑BA) evaluates the benefits of reimbursable drugs with new active ingredients. This includes assessment of the additional benefit and its therapeutic relevance. METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed using individual patient data based on two phase III studies. Both studies examined the safety and efficacy of dupilumab as an add-on therapy to INCS for treatment of CRSwNP in adults inadequately controlled with systemic corticosteroids and/or surgery compared to INCS alone. RESULTS: Based on the present data, the G‑BA decided that there is an indication of a considerable additional benefit of dupilumab compared to mometasone furoate. CONCLUSION: For patients with severe CRSwNP inadequately controlled with INCS and systemic corticosteroids and/or surgery, there is an indication of a considerable additional benefit for the administration of dupilumab as an add-on therapy to INCS compared to mometasone furoate alone.","Klimek, L.; Chaker, A.; Deitmer, T.; Plontke, S.

We sought to understand whether these methods could achieve a diverse sample of participants. With more researchers turning to approaches that maintain social distancing in the context of COVID-19, it has become more pressing to refine these remote research methods. METHODS: We used several online sites to recruit for and conduct cognitive testing of survey items. To recruit potential participants we advertised the study on the free online bulletin board, Craigslist, and the free online social network, Reddit. Interested participants completed an online Qualtrics screening form. To maximize diversity, we purposefully selected individuals to invite for participation. We used the video meeting platform, Zoom, to conduct the cognitive interviews. The interviewer opened a document with the items to be tested, shared the screen with the participant, and gave them control of the mouse and keyboard. After the participant self-administered the survey, the interviewer asked about interpretation and comprehension. After completion of the interviews we sent participants a follow-up survey about their impressions of the research methods and technologies used. We describe the processes, the advantages and disadvantages, and offer recommendations for researchers. RESULTS: We recruited and interviewed 30 young people from a range of regions, gender identities, sexual orientations, ages, education, and experiences with sexual activity. These methods allowed us to recruit a purposefully selected diverse sample in terms of race/ethnicity and region. It also may have offered potential participants a feeling of safety and anonymity leading to greater participation from gay, lesbian, and transgender people who would not have agreed to participate in-person. Conducting the interviews using video chat may also have facilitated the inclusion of individuals who would not volunteer for in-person meetings.

680633,Promoting Functional Communication Within the Home,2020-05-12,"Genetic perturbation screens using RNA interference (RNAi) have been conducted successfully to identify host factors that are essential for the life cycle of bacteria or viruses. So far, most published studies identified host factors primarily for single pathogens. Furthermore, often only a small subset of genes, e.g., genes encoding kinases, have been targeted. Identification of host factors on a pan-pathogen level, i.e., genes that are crucial for the replication of a diverse group of pathogens has received relatively little attention, despite the fact that such common host factors would be highly relevant, for instance, for devising broad-spectrum anti-pathogenic drugs. Here, we present a novel two-stage procedure for the identification of host factors involved in the replication of different viruses using a combination of random effects models and Markov random walks on a functional interaction network. We first infer candidate genes by jointly analyzing multiple perturbations screens while at the same time adjusting for high variance inherent in these screens. Subsequently the inferred estimates are spread across a network of functional interactions thereby allowing for the analysis of missing genes in the biological studies, smoothing the effect sizes of previously found host factors, and considering a priori pathway information defined over edges of the network. We applied the procedure to RNAi screening data of four different positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, Hepatitis C virus, Chikungunya virus, Dengue virus and Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and detected novel host factors, including UBC, PLCG1, and DYRK1B, which are predicted to significantly impact the replication cycles of these viruses. We validated the detected host factors experimentally using pharmacological inhibition and an additional siRNA screen and found that some of the predicted host factors indeed influence the replication of these pathogens.","Dirmeier, Simon; Dächert, Christopher; van Hemert, Martijn; Tas, Ali; Ogando, Natacha S.; van Kuppeveld, Frank; Bartenschlager, Ralf; Kaderali, Lars; Binder, Marco; Beerenwinkel, Niko",PLoS Comput Biol,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007587; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32040506/,404

Despite the fact that the mgc2 gene has been widely used for diagnostic and molecular characterization purposes, there is a lack of evidence supporting the reliability of this gene as a marker for molecular epidemiology approaches. Therefore, the current study aimed to assess the accuracy of the mgc2 gene for phylogenetic, phylodynamic, and phylogeographic evaluations. Furthermore, the global phylodynamic expansion of MG is described, and the origin and extension of the outbreak caused by MG in Ecuador were tracked and characterized. The results obtained strongly supported the use of the mgc2 gene as a reliable phylogenetic marker and accurate estimator for the temporal and phylogeographic structure reconstruction of MG. The phylodynamic analysis denoted the failures in the current policies to control MG and highlighted the imperative need to implement more sensitive methodologies of diagnosis and more efficient vaccines.

And yet, there is significant variation in people’s compliance with the lockdown measures introduced by governments in order to curb the spread of the virus. In this paper, we show that much of this variation can be explained by different cultural traits. Specifically, we advance the hypothesis that individualism, which puts greater value on personal freedom, makes government intervention harder, whereas collectivism, which emphasises the wellbeing of the group, makes collective action easier. We find support for these ideas across 111 countries, but also when exploiting within country variation in the two largest economies in the world: China and the United States. Across a host of specifications, people were less abiding by the lockdown rules in places with greater prevalence of individualistic cultural traits. We conclude that cultural factors play a critical role in successful policy implementation.","Chen, Chinchih; Frey, Carl Benedikt; Presidente, Giorgio",J Econ Behav Organ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268121003140; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167268121003140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34566218/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2021.07.026,404

686079,Bacteremia during COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary hospital in Spain,2021-02-11,"BACKGROUND: understanding care-home outbreaks of COVID-19 is a key public health priority in the ongoing pandemic to help protect vulnerable residents. OBJECTIVE: to describe all outbreaks of COVID-19 infection in Scottish care-homes for older people between 01/03/2020 to 31/03/2020, with follow-up to 30/06/2020. DESIGN AND SETTING: national linked data cohort analysis of Scottish care-homes for older people. METHODS: data linkage was used to identify outbreaks of COVID-19 in care-homes. Care-home characteristics associated with the presence of an outbreak were examined using logistic regression. Size of outbreaks was modelled using negative binomial regression. RESULTS: 334 (41%) Scottish care-homes for older people experienced an outbreak, with heterogeneity in outbreak size (1–63 cases; median = 6) and duration (1–94 days; median = 31.5 days). Four distinct patterns of outbreak were identified: ‘Typical’ (38% of outbreaks, mean 11.2 cases and 48 days duration), Severe (11%, mean 29.7 cases and 60 days), Contained (37%, mean 3.5 cases and 13 days), and Late-onset (14%, mean 5.4 cases and 17 days). Risk of a COVID-19 outbreak increased with increasing care-home size (for ≥90 beds vs <20, adjusted OR = 55.4, 95%CI 15.0–251.7) and rising community prevalence (OR = 1.2 [1.0–1.4] per 100 cases/100,000 population increase). No routinely available care-home characteristic was associated with outbreak size. CONCLUSIONS: reducing community prevalence of COVID-19 infection is essential to protect those living in care-homes. More systematic national data collection to understand care-home residents and the homes in which they live is a priority in ensuring we can respond more effectively in future.","Burton, Jennifer Kirsty; McMinn, Megan; Vaughan, James E; Fleuriot, Jacques; Guthrie, Bruce",Age Ageing,https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afab099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33963849/,404

We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of the Xpert Xpress and the ID NOW assays for rapid detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 using a systemic review and meta‐analysis approach. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register. The sensitivity and specificity of these tests for detecting viruses in patients with suspected SARS‐CoV‐2 infection were pooled. We used commercial and laboratory‐developed reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reactions as reference standards. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies‐2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias. We identified 11 studies involving 1734 subjects for the Xpert Xpress assay and 10 studies involving 1778 subjects for the ID NOW assay. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert Xpress assay for detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 were 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97 to 0.99) and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95 to 0.98), respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the ID NOW assay were 0.79 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.86) and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.98 to 1.00), respectively. The studies included in our analysis seemed to have low methodological quality. The Xpert Xpress assay showed excellent diagnostic accuracy for rapid detection of SARS‐CoV‐2. However, as the ID NOW assay showed relatively low sensitivity, this test might miss several positive samples.","Lee, Jonghoo; Song, Jae‐Uk",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33913533/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26994,404
