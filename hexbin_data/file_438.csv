4327,Continuous Vital Sign Analysis for Predicting and Preventing Neonatal Diseases in the 21(st) Century - Big Data to the Forefront,2019-08-04,"In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation are vital signs (VS) that are continuously monitored in infants, while blood pressure is often monitored continuously immediately after birth, or during critical illness. Although changes in VS can reflect infant physiology or circadian rhythms, persistent deviations in absolute values or complex changes in variability, can indicate acute or chronic pathology. Recent studies demonstrate that analysis of continuous VS trends can predict sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, brain injury, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cardiorespiratory decompensation, and mortality. Subtle changes in continuous VS patterns may not be discerned even by experienced clinicians reviewing spot VS data or VS trends captured in the monitor. In contrast, objective analysis of continuous VS data can improve neonatal outcomes by allowing heightened vigilance or preemptive interventions. In this review, we provide an overview of the studies that have used continuous analysis of single or multiple VS, their interactions, and combined VS and clinical analytic tools, to predict or detect neonatal pathophysiology. We make the case that big-data analytics are promising, and with continued improvements, can become a powerful tool to mitigate neonatal diseases in the 21(st) century.","Kumar, Navin; Akangire, Gangaram; Sullivan, Brynne; Fairchild, Karen; Sampath, Venkatesh",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6962536/,438
7307,Understanding the effect of vector dynamics in epidemic models using center manifold analysis,2012-09-26,"Human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is pandemic. It has affected nearly 60 million people since the detection of the disease in 1981 to date. In this paper basic deterministic HIV/AIDS model with mass action incidence function are developed. Stability analysis is carried out. And the disease free equilibrium of the basic model was found to be locally asymptotically stable whenever the threshold parameter (RO) value is less than one, and unstable otherwise. The model is extended by introducing two optimal control strategies namely, CD4 counts and treatment for the infective using optimal control theory. Numerical simulation was carried out in order to illustrate the analytic results.","Sule, Amiru; Abdullah, Farah Aini",AIP Conf Proc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108779/,438

In the present paper, we develop a shorter, psychometrically improved measure of numeracy—the ability to understand, manipulate, and use numerical information, including probabilities. Across two large independent samples that varied widely in age and educational level, participants completed 18 items from existing numeracy measures. In Study 1, we conducted a Rasch analysis on the item pool and created an eight‐item numeracy scale that assesses a broader range of difficulty than previous scales. In Study 2, we replicated this eight‐item scale in a separate Rasch analysis using data from an independent sample. We also found that the new Rasch‐based numeracy scale, compared with previous measures, could predict decision‐making preferences obtained in past studies, supporting its predictive validity. In Study, 3, we further established the predictive validity of the Rasch‐based numeracy scale. Specifically, we examined the associations between numeracy and risk judgments, compared with previous scales. Overall, we found that the Rasch‐based scale was a better linear predictor of risk judgments than prior measures. Moreover, this study is the first to present the psychometric properties of several popular numeracy measures across a diverse sample of ages and educational level. We discuss the usefulness and the advantages of the new scale, which we feel can be used in a wide range of subject populations, allowing for a more clear understanding of how numeracy is associated with decision processes.

Asthmaticchildren experienced a significantly greater frequency of viral respiratory infections than did nonasthmatic ones (5.1 vs. 3.8 per subject). This increased incidence appeared to be largely the result of a greater number of rhinovirus infections. While respiratory infections of identical etiology that occurred concurrently in an asthmatic and his sibling were equivalent in severity, illnesses were longer (but not significantly so) in asthmatic children.","Minor, Theodore E.; Baker, James W.; Dick, Elliot C.; DeMeo, Anthony N.; Ouellette, John J.; Cohen, Marcus; Reed, Charles E.",J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172930/,438

The aim of this study was to get a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology of AMDV in northeast China to control and prevent AMD from further spreading. This study for the first time isolated AMDV from fecal swab samples of mink in China. RESULTS: A total of 157/291 (54.0%) of the fecal swab samples were positive for AMDV. Of these, 23 AMDV positive samples were randomly selected for sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis based on the acquired partial fragments of VP2 gene with the hypervariable region. Comparative DNA sequence analysis of 23 AMDV isolates with a reference nonpathogenic (AMDV-G) strain revealed 8.3% difference in partial VP2 nucleotide sequences. Amino acid alignment indicated the presence of several genetic variants, as well as one single amino acid residue deletion. The most concentrated area of variation was located in the hypervariable region of VP2 protein. According to phylogenetic analysis, the Chinese AMDV strains and the other reference AMDV strains from different countries clustered into three groups (clades A, B and C). Most of the newly sequenced strains were found to form a Chinese-specific group, which solely consisted of Chinese AMDV strains. CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that a high genetic diversity was found in Chinese AMDV strains and the virus distribution were not dependent on geographical origin. Both local and imported AMDV positive species were prevalent in the Chinese mink farming population. The genetic evidence of AMDV variety and epidemic isolates have importance in mink farming practice.","Tong, Mingwei; Sun, Na; Cao, Zhigang; Cheng, Yuening; Zhang, Miao; Cheng, Shipeng; Yi, Li",BMC Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7395569/,438

Forty Japanese patients (once-weekly arm, n = 26; twice-weekly arm, n = 14) were randomized in A.R.R.O.W. In the Japanese subgroup of A.R.R.O.W., median PFS was 14.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.5–not evaluable [NE]) and 9.7 months (95% CI, 3.8–NE) in the once- and twice-weekly arms, respectively. The overall response rate (ORR) was 73.1% (19/26; 95% CI, 52.2–88.4) and 57.1% (8/14; 95% CI, 28.9–82.3) in each arm. The adverse events (AEs) incidence was 100% in both arms. Grade ≥ 3 AE incidence was 80.8% (21/26) and 78.6% (11/14) in each arm. Two fatal treatment-related AEs (acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome) occurred in the once-weekly arm. In exploratory unadjusted analyses of A.R.R.O.W.

METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated records of consecutive patients with severe cholangitis who were admitted in the ICU. Bedside PTBD was performed using ultrasound guidance. The level and cause of biliary obstruction were recorded. The technical success of the procedure and complications were recorded. RESULTS: Ten patients (six males, mean age 53.8 years) underwent bedside PTBD. Six patients had distal common bile duct blockade [periampullary carcinoma (n = 2), carcinoma pancreas (n = 2), choledocholithiasis (n = 1), and benign stricture (n = 1)]. Four patients had malignant hilar stricture [cholangiocarcinoma (n = 3) and carcinoma gallbladder (n = 1)]. Technical success was achieved in all. One patient underwent bilateral PTBD. Left and right PTBD were performed in 5 and 4 patients, respectively. There were no major complications. Transient hemobilia occurred in two patients. CONCLUSION: Bedside PTBD is safe and technically feasible.

14521,"Sustainability in the Aerospace, Naval, and Automotive Supply Chain 4.0: Descriptive Review",2020-12-10,"Glycoprotein G (gG) from herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively) functions as a viral chemokine binding protein (vCKBP). Soluble recombinant forms of gG of HSV-1 and HSV-2 (SgG1 and SgG2, respectively) enhance chemokine-mediated leukocyte migration, in contrast to most known vCKBPs, including those from animal alpha-herpesviruses. Furthermore, both proteins bind to nerve growth factor (NGF), but only SgG2 enhances NGF-dependent neurite outgrowth. The basis and implications of this functional difference between the two proteins are still unknown. While gG1 and gG2 are positional homologues in the genome, they share very limited sequence homology. In fact, US4, the open reading frame encoding gG is the most divergent genetic locus between these viruses. Full-length gG1 and gG2 are type I transmembrane proteins located on the plasma membrane of infected cells and at the viral envelope. However, gG2 is larger than gG1 and is cleaved during protein maturation, secreting the N-terminal domain to the supernatant of infected cells, whereas gG1 is not. The enzyme involved in gG2 cleavage and the functional relevance of gG2 cleavage and secretion are unknown. We aim to identify the gG2 sequence required for cleavage to determine its functional role in future experiments. Our results prove the existence of at least two cleavage motifs in gG2 within the amino acid region 314-343. Transfer of this sequence to a fusion protein results in cleavage. Finally, we show that propeptide convertases like furin are responsible for gG2 cleavage.","Kropp, Kai A.; Srivaratharajan, Sangar; Ritter, Birgit; Yu, Pengfei; Krooss, Simon; Polten, Felix; Pich, Andreas; Alcami, Antonio; Viejo-Borbolla, Abel",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7763493/,438

As part of a healthy campus initiative, generated to address these and other food production and consumption dilemmas, a student-run “local and sustainable” food establishment called Food Next Door (FND) was created. This intrinsic case study evaluated food literacy in health science students, faculty, and staff first as a pilot to build the case for FND and further explicated customers’, volunteers’, and leads’ experiences with FND, identifying potential pathways from food literacy to citizenship. Ten returning customers, eight recurring nutrition student volunteers, and three graduate student leads participated in interviews that were analyzed for themes and subthemes. The findings show a progression in themes. Customers’ experiences highlight FND’s fresh, flavorful food, smiling and supportive staff, and personal transformation. Volunteers’ themes identified greater awareness of new foods and plant-based eating, acquiring new knowledge and skills in commercial kitchens, and deepening their connection to food, each other, and to where food comes from. Leads’ themes show opportunities to gain managerial skills, a deeper understanding of food and skills from being immersed in value-based food systems, and confidence in peer teaching. Experiencing and becoming part of the food value chain through FND built food literacy, shifted values, and transformed students into food citizens.","Meyer, Nanna; Kluge, Mary Ann; Svette, Sean; Shrader, Alyssa; Vanderwoude, Andrea; Frieler, Bethany",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7827084/,438

For working electrodes preparation, drop casting proved to be the most convenient and thus most widely applied method. However, appropriate interpretation of obtained electrochemical signal requires in-depth knowledge of limitations related to this technique. In this study, we prepared solutions based on commonly reported polymers for nanostructures immobilization and investigated their influence on copper sulfides distribution on the electrode. Characterization of suspensions properties and behavior of particles during droplet drying revealed that nonionic polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was favorable for electrodes modification with copper sulfides in comparison with Nafion and chitosan. It ensured homogeneity of the suspension as well as the uniform coverage of the electrode surface with particles, what resulted in increased active surface area and, therefore, higher signal from glucose addition. On the other hand, when cationic chitosan was used as a binder, suspensions were agglomerated and, within dry deposits, a coffee-ring effect was observed. Appropriate adjustment of material and polymer interactions led to enhanced electrode electrochemical performance.","Mazurków, Julia; Kusior, Anna; Radecka, Marta",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7865286/,438
20153,"Proceedings of ‘FETP-ICON 2020’ Conference: Chennai, India. 3-5 March 2020",2021-08-19,"OBJECTIVES: Identifying whether the demand for medical services is catered to is an important issue. Given that depression is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease, it could affect the use of healthcare. This study aims to examine the association between the severity of new-onset depression and unmet healthcare needs among South Korean adults. METHODS: Data from 15,588 participants, derived from the 2014, 2016, and 2018 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, were examined. Only individuals who were not diagnosed with depression was included to exclude those who visited hospitals to treat depression or were experiencing unmet healthcare needs due to depression. Depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and unmet healthcare needs acted as the dependent variable. A multiple/multinomial logistic regression analysis was built to analyze the association between the variables. RESULTS: Individuals with severe depression had a higher risk of having unmet healthcare needs compared to those without (men: adjusted OR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.40–3.00; women: adjusted OR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.72–2.82). White-collar men with severe depression also had a higher risk of having unmet healthcare needs (adjusted OR = 9.72, 95% CI = 4.73–20.00). Individuals with severe depression had a higher risk of having unmet healthcare needs due to economic hardship than those without depression (men: adjusted OR = 3.01, 95% CI = 1.76–5.14, women: adjusted OR = 2.93, 95% CI = 1.96–4.38). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a significant relationship between the severity of new-onset depression and the risk of having unmet healthcare needs among South Korean adults. Our study suggests that having severe depression contributed to a higher risk of unmet healthcare needs. Proper care to manage depression can be promoted through future intervention programs that alleviate the risk of having unmet healthcare needs.","Kim, Su Yeon; Jeong, Wonjeong; Park, Eun-Cheol; Park, Sohee; Jang, Sung-In",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8375986/,438

This conceptual and empirically driven model provides promising new directions to investigate mechanisms linking individuals' relationships behaviors to their own and their partners' health, with particular emphasis on biological pathways. These mechanisms may impact each partner's physical health outcomes, such as disease development, illness severity, and accelerated biological aging. Risk and protective factors across developmental stages and diverse contexts are also discussed to help explain how, and under what conditions, partners influence each other's health.

24895,Online Social Networks Flu Trend Tracker: A Novel Sensory Approach to Predict Flu Trends,2013,"Acute chest diseases include clinical situations with infectious and traumatic etiology. Pulmonary infection is the most common indication for performing chest radiography. Radiological imaging often confirms the diagnosis and allows the evaluation of the location and extent of infection. Chest radiography is the primary imaging procedure and the starting point for the evaluation of all children with acute chest disease. Accurate interpretation of pediatric chest films also requires a basic understanding of the physiologic and anatomic differences among adults, neonates, and infants and their most important differences will be referred. Characterization of pulmonary infiltrates is important, because patterns of abnormality suggest specific organisms and aetiologies. Although providing evidence suggestive of the causative agent, the chest radiograph cannot confirm viral infection, confirm or exclude bacterial etiology. In fact, in infancy, pneumonia usually produces a combination of alterations of the airspace and interstitium. However, some aspects may be useful in distinguishing between viral and bacterial pneumonia. Close attention to CT technique is crucial for imaging evaluation of pneumonia in pediatric patients, namely those with persistent symptoms and/or progressive symptoms despite medical or surgical therapy, or in immunocompromised patients. CT with low radiation dose technique should be carefully performed in these cases. CT examination with IV contrast is very useful for the evaluation of complications of chest infection. Thoracic trauma in children is rare, only 4–6 % of children are hospitalized following severe trauma. Only a small number of children with trauma have thoracic injury (14 %), but the injuries tend to be of serious nature. About 25–50 % of thoracic trauma cases occur in combination with other trauma locations. Pulmonary contusion and lacerations, tracheobronchial injuries, pneumothorax, and esophageal rupture are referred as the main consequences of trauma. The decision for the appropriate use of imaging techniques must consider the specific case under review. Chest radiography should be the initial screening method. The decision to use CT is determined by the nature of the trauma, the clinical circumstances, and the prediction of future revaluation, always taking into account the radiation dose applied to the child.","Santos, José Fonseca",Pediatric Chest Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121356/,438

34248,"Conclusions: Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality",2020-06-11,"Nowadays, the implementation of cloud manufacturing technologies epitomizes the avant-garde in production systems. This affects several aspects of the management of these production systems, in particular scheduling activities, due to the possibility provided by cloud manufacturing of having real-time information about the stages of a product life cycle and about the status of all services. However, so far, cloud manufacturing has mainly focused on machines, with limited interest in material handling systems. This shortfall has been addressed in this study, where a new material-handling paradigm, called Cloud Material Handling System (CMHS) and developed in the Logistics 4.0 Lab at NTNU (Norway), has been introduced. With CMHS, the scheduling of the Material Handling Modules (MHMs) can be optimized, increasing the flexibility and productivity of the overall manufacturing system. To achieve this, the integration of advanced industry 4.0 technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), and in particular Indoor Positioning Technologies (IPT), Cloud Computing, Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI), is required. In fact, based on the relevant information provided on the cloud platform by IPT and IoT for each product, called Smart Object (SO) (position, physical characteristics and so on), an Intelligent Cognitive Engine (ICE) can use ML and AI to decide, in real time, which MHM is most suitable for carrying out the tasks required by these products based on a compatibility matrix, on their attributes, and on the defined scheduling procedure.","Sgarbossa, Fabio; Peron, Mirco; Fragapane, Giuseppe",Scheduling in Industry 4.0 and Cloud Manufacturing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7279427/,438

Similarly, notwithstanding the gaining popularity of non-invasive modalities like high-flow nasal therapy, the practices of weaning and escalating support are largely individualized and based on point of care observations. These are often erroneous and lack objectivity. Histogram analysis from patient monitors is an easy and objective way of quantifying vital parameters and their trends. We review the technology and evidence available behind this practice. Conclusions: Though there are no randomized controlled trials on this practice solely, we identify several quality improvement studies implementing this into practice with benefit. We also cite studies which have implemented histogram analysis in methodology, thus concluding that this is a useful clinical tool worth incorporating into clinical practice to reduce manual errors and bring more objectivity into decisions.","Sur, Amitava; Paria, Anshuman",Eur J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7340773/,438

To support assurance that the system satisfies its requirements, it is desirable that continuous verification can be performed after each refinement or revision step. To achieve practical adoption, formal verification must accommodate continuous verification efficiently and effectively. Model checking provides developers with information useful to improve their models only when a property is not satisfied, i.e., when a counterexample is returned. However, it is desirable to have some useful information also when a property is instead satisfied. To address this problem we propose TOrPEDO, an approach that supports verification in two complementary forms: model checking and proofs. While model checking is typically used to pinpoint model behaviors that violate requirements, proofs can instead explain why requirements are satisfied. In our work, we introduce a specific notion of proof, called Topological Proof. A topological proof produces a slice of the original model that justifies the property satisfaction. Because models can be incomplete, TOrPEDO supports reasoning on requirements satisfaction, violation, and possible satisfaction (in the case where satisfaction depends on unknown parts of the model). Evaluation is performed by checking how topological proofs support software development on 12 modeling scenarios and 15 different properties obtained from 3 examples from literature. Results show that: (i) topological proofs are [Formula: see text]60% smaller than the original models; (ii) after a revision, in [Formula: see text]78% of cases, the property can be re-verified by relying on a simple syntactic check.","Menghi, Claudio; Rizzi, Alessandro Maria; Bernasconi, Anna",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7418138/,438

Being understood as mutually integrated, both activities have been re-united under one single label. In contrast to traditional software development activities, DevOps promotes numerous fundamental changes, and the area of software testing is not an exception. Yet, the exact appearance of software testing within DevOps is poorly understood, so is the notion of TestOps. Objective: This paper explores TestOps as a concept rooted in industrial practice. Method: To provide a pluralist outline of practitioners’ views on What is TestOps, the YouTube platform was searched for digital content containing either “TestOps” or “DevTestOps” in the content title. Through a qualitative lens, the resulting set was systematically annotated and thematically analyzed in an inductive manner. Results: Referring to DevOps, practitioners use the notion of TestOps when characterizing a conceptual shift that occurs within the area of software testing. As a matter of fact, two dominant categories were found in the data: (i) TestOps as a new organizational philosophy; (ii) TestOps as an innovative software technique (i.e. process supported by technology). A set of high-level themes within each of these categories was identified and described. Conclusion: The study outlines an inconsistency in practitioner perspectives on the nature of TestOps. To decrease the identified conceptual ambiguity, the proposed model posits two complementary meanings of TestOps.","Doležel, Michal",Agile Processes in Software Engineering and Extreme Programming - Workshops,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7510783/,438

We hypothesize that PICCs with larger lumen size may be reliable for the cardiac index assessment using the TPTD. METHODS: This is a single-centre, prospective method–comparison study that included adult patients admitted in ICU who required a calibrated Pulse Contour hemodynamic monitoring system (VolumeView/EV1000™) for circulatory shock and had both PICC and CICC in place. We compared TPTD measurements via single-lumen 5Fr or triple-lumen 6Fr polyurethane power injectable PICCs with triple-lumen 7Fr CICC (reference standard). To rule out biases related to manual injection, measurements were repeated using an automated rapid injection system. We performed Bland–Altman analysis accounting for multiple observations per patient. RESULTS: A total of 320 measurements were performed in 15 patients. During the manual phase, the cardiac index measured with either single-lumen 5Fr or triple-lumen 6Fr PICCs were comparable with cardiac index measured with triple-lumen 7Fr CICC (3.2 ± 1.04 vs. 3.2 ± 1.06 L/min/m(2), bias 2.2% and 3.3 ± 0.8 vs. 3.0 ± 0.7 L/min/m(2), bias 8.5%, respectively). During the automated phase, triple-lumen 6Fr PICC slightly overestimated the cardiac index when compared to triple-lumen 7Fr CICC (CI 3.4 ± 0.7 vs. 3.0 ± 0.7 L/min/m(2), bias 12.5%; p = 0.012). For both single-lumen 5Fr and triple-lumen 6Fr PICCs, percentage error vs. triple-lumen 7Fr CICC was below 20% (14.7% and 19% during the manual phase and 14.4% and 13.8% during the automated phase, respectively). Similar results were observed for TPTD-derived parameters. CONCLUSIONS: During hemodynamic monitoring with TPTD, both single-lumen 5Fr PICCs and triple-lumen 6Fr PICCs can be used for cold fluid bolus injection as an alternative to CICC (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04241926).","D’Arrigo, Sonia; Sandroni, Claudio; Cacciola, Sofia; Dell’Anna, Antonio Maria; Pittiruti, Mauro; Annetta, Maria Giuseppina; Colosimo, Cesare; Antonelli, Massimo",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7720030/,438

However, there is uncertainty regarding whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was acquired at work versus in the community. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study to examine exposure history of personnel with COVID-19 infection or asymptomatic carriage in a VA healthcare system. High-risk exposures were classified based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. RESULTS: Of 578 personnel tested, 49 (8%) had nasopharyngeal swabs with positive PCR results, including 45 (92%) with and 4 (8%) without COVID-19 symptoms. Of the 49 cases, 21 (43%) had a documented high-risk exposure at work, including 14 exposures to COVID-19 patients and 7 exposures to colonized or infected personnel. Exposures to infected patients most often were a result of delays in recognition of COVID-19 due to atypical presentations. Exposures to personnel with COVID-19 most often involved activities such as meals when facemasks were not worn. Most cases occurred among nurses (26, 53%) and administrative personnel (10, 20%); only 3 physicians developed COVID-19. No cases occurred in personnel working on COVID-19 wards. All personnel had mild or moderate disease. CONCLUSION: Forty-three percent of healthcare personnel with COVID-19 had prior high-risk exposures at work. Improved detection of patients with atypical presentations and efforts to reduce high-risk contacts among personnel may reduce the risk for acquisition of SARS-CoV-2.

Built on several well-established theories, this conceptual study intends to develop a new and holistic framework to examine destination sustainability, focusing on the change of resident-tourist relationships. The framework is first guided by the stakeholder theory to identify the four key stakeholders in the new sharing economy context: residents, tourists, governments, and the sharing economy platform. With the collaboration theory and resource theory as a foundation, the framework then describes each stakeholder’s specific needs and resources. The service-dominant logic further supports service exchanges and value co-creation among stakeholders. The framework then adopts the capital theory approach to conceptualize destination sustainability in terms of human, social, natural and manufactured capital. Finally, three propositions are developed to justify the new peer-to-peer collaboration paradigm that leads to destination sustainability.

It is characterised by massive proteinuria and severe edoema. Progression to end-stage kidney failure occurs during early childhood and the only curative treatment is kidney transplantation. Nowadays, patients need aggressive medical treatment, which includes daily albumin infusions (for months) until they get clinical stability to receive transplant. Objective: In our paediatric hospital, we implemented a multidisciplinary program for the home infusion of albumin with outpatient follow-up. The aim of the study was to assess the safety and efficacy of this program for the first four years of its implementation. Material and Methods: Retrospective observational study of CNF paediatric patients treated with home albumin infusion therapy from March 2014 to July 2018 at a tertiary care paediatric hospital. Information on albumin administration was obtained from the electronic prescription assistance program and details on clinical and care-related variables from the hospital's electronic information systems. Results: Four patients with CNF received albumin infusions for 18, 21, 22 months, and 3 years. The treatment was safe, and the complication rates were to be expected considering the severity of disease. Patients required a median of two hospital admissions a year (19 in total); 47% due to catheter-related complications, but there were just three catheter infections. Conclusions: In our experience, home albumin infusion therapy is safe and effective and helps to improve children health and quality of life.","Serramontmany, Eugènia; Muñoz, Marina; Fernández-Polo, Aurora; Morillo, María; Gómez-Ganda, Laura; Cañete-Ramírez, Carme; Ariceta, Gema",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7841340/,438

This is due to the model allowing for the lowering of costs and widespread distribution of manufacturing. On the other hand, low adherence to its best practices and insufficient development may jeopardize OSH as a viable aid against the pandemic. In this work, we sought to clarify to what extent publicly available designs of ventilator and PPE are developed and abide by OSH standards as measure of the true openness of the solutions. METHODS: We searched the Internet and the literature to compile a comprehensive list of ventilators and PPE, while assessing available documentation in order to objectively evaluate key development landmarks (e.g., testing and governmental clearance) and indicators of adherence by OSH standards, as described by the Open Source Hardware Association. RESULTS: Only a few peer-reviewed articles have been found, while a good number of Internet entries of open ventilator and PPE designs were found. Available documentation varied a lot in quantity and quality. Overall, adherence to OSH best practices and level of development were only partially fulfilled. CONCLUSIONS: Although this suboptimal performance regarding openness of designs may limit the benefits of the model, data suggests that present open-source efforts are highly beneficial and that they will be able to completely fulfill their mission given more and better OSH is carried out.","Santos, Maikon Lorran; Zacharias, Leonardo Rakauskas; Cota, Vinícius Rosa",Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7854879/,438

To give insight into the consequences of the pandemic on the longer term and to discuss these consequences in a systematic way, this article develops four potential maritime futures. These potential maritime futures are based on two key choices, the development of the EU and state-aid to maritime sectors. The first choice concerns a connected and solidary Europe versus a fragmented and differentiated EU. The second choice concerns the development of active maritime industry policies by the EU and Member States versus a neo-liberal free market model. Combining these two choices results in four potential maritime futures: “on board”, “single-handed sailing”, “all hands on deck”, and “to give a wide berth”. These maritime futures differ from each other in (marine) governance structures and processes and the support given to maritime sectors. The maritime futures give insight into the enabling and constraining conditions to deal with the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic in specific, and how the maritime futures will affect the sustainable development of maritime sectors in general.

CF is associated with abnormalities in fatty acids, ceramides, and cholesterol, their relationship with CF lung pathology is not completely understood. Therefore, we examined the impact of CFTR deficiency on lipid metabolism and pro-inflammatory signaling in airway epithelium using mass spectrometric, protein array. We observed a striking imbalance in fatty acid and ceramide metabolism, associated with chronic oxidative stress under basal conditions in CF mouse lung and well-differentiated bronchial epithelial cell cultures of CFTR knock out pig and CF patients. Cell-autonomous features of all three CF models included high ratios of ω-6- to ω-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids and of long- to very long-chain ceramide species (LCC/VLCC), reduced levels of total ceramides and ceramide precursors. In addition to the retinoic acid analog fenretinide, the anti-oxidants glutathione (GSH) and deferoxamine partially corrected the lipid profile indicating that oxidative stress may promote the lipid abnormalities. CFTR-targeted modulators reduced the lipid imbalance and oxidative stress, confirming the CFTR dependence of lipid ratios. However, despite functional correction of CF cells up to 60% of non-CF in Ussing chamber experiments, a 72-h triple compound treatment (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor surrogate) did not completely normalize lipid imbalance or oxidative stress. Protein array analysis revealed differential expression and shedding of cytokines and growth factors from CF epithelial cells compared to non-CF cells, consistent with sterile inflammation and tissue remodeling under basal conditions, including enhanced secretion of the neutrophil activator CXCL5, and the T-cell activator CCL17. However, treatment with antioxidants or CFTR modulators that mimic the approved combination therapies, ivacaftor/lumacaftor and ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, did not effectively suppress the inflammatory phenotype. We propose that CFTR deficiency causes oxidative stress in CF airway epithelium, affecting multiple bioactive lipid metabolic pathways, which likely play a role in CF lung disease progression. A combination of anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and CFTR targeted therapeutics may be required for full correction of the CF phenotype.","Veltman, Mieke; De Sanctis, Juan B.; Stolarczyk, Marta; Klymiuk, Nikolai; Bähr, Andrea; Brouwer, Rutger W.; Oole, Edwin; Shah, Juhi; Ozdian, Tomas; Liao, Jie; Martini, Carolina; Radzioch, Danuta; Hanrahan, John W.; Scholte, Bob J.",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7891400/,438

Design and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using a structured questionnaire. Data was collected from 21 to 30 August 2020, via both online survey and personal interviews using a non-probability self-nominated sample. Results: A total of 731 participants completed the questionnaire. The mean age was 32.1± 2.1 and 64.3% were females. The main sources of knowledge were, Internet and Social Media followed by TV then family and friends. More than 96% of the respondents knew the origin, nature, the main symptoms, and the modes of transmission of COVID-19, however, 37.6% of them thought that COVID-19 patients must develop symptoms. 75.8% and 73.6% of the participants respectively covered their nose and mouth during sneezing and washed their hands regularly, 65.4% wore masks in crowded places, while only 31.1% and 30% of them respectively avoided touching their faces or shaking hands with friends. Knowledge and practice were positively correlated and both were linked to younger age and higher education and the female gender was also a predictor of better practice. The most common perceived barriers to adherence to preventive measures were feeling uncomfortable, forgetfulness then financial causes. Conclusions: the study subjects were aware of COVID-19 and its preventive measures however adherence to some of these measures was not prevalent amongst them, indicating an urgent need of addressing and targeting barriers that hinder adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures in the future policies to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Egypt.","Abd Elhameed Ali, Rasha; Ahmed Ghaleb, Alaa; Abokresha, Seham Ahmed",J Public Health Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7967493/,438

In the liver, vitamin D is converted to 25(OH)-vitamin D and finally in the kidney to 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D, which is a hormone regulating bone and mineral metabolism. Besides the kidneys, other organs are also capable of making 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D, which exerts autocrine and paracrine effects. For these pleiotropic effects, a continuous vitamin D supply (daily supplements) with moderate doses is more effective than high-dose bolus applications. Beside the classical effects of 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D on the musculoskeletal system, there is good evidence for extraskeletal effects on the immune system. A good vitamin D supply can reduce the risk of respiratory infections. At the present time, the preventive and therapeutic use of vitamin D regarding COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19) is of great interest.","Scharla, Stephan H.",J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7968561/,438

In these methodologies, software is developed iteratively and delivered to the client in increments called releases. In the releases, the goal is to develop system functionality that quickly adds value to the client’s business. At the beginning of the project, one or more releases are planned. For solving the problem of replanning in the context of releases, a model is proposed considering the characteristics of agile development using Scrum. The results obtained show that the algorithm takes a little less than 7 min for solutions that propose replanning composed by 16 sprints, which is equivalent to 240 days of project.

In recent years, the use of deep learning for MOT in the videos recorded by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has introduced more challenges and hence has a lot of room for extensive research. For the tracking-by-detection method, the three main components, object detector, tracker and data associator, play an equally important role and each part should be tuned to the highest efficiency to increase the overall performance. In this paper, the parameter selection of the Kalman filter and Hungarian algorithm for sheep tracking in paddock videos is discussed. An experimental comparison is presented to show that if the detector is already providing good results, a small change in the system can degrade or improve the tracking capabilities of remaining components. The encouraging results provide an important step in an automated UAV-based sheep tracking system.","Sarwar, Farah; Griffin, Anthony; Pasang, Timotius",Geometry and Vision,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971817/,438

A newly proposed adversarial discriminator is piggybacked to the segmentation network, which is used to improve the spatial continuity and label consistency in a scene without explicitly specifying the contextual relationships. The segmentation network itself serves as a generator to produce an initial segmentation map (pixel-wise labels). The discriminator then takes the labels and compare them with the ground truth data to further update the generator in order to enhance the accuracy of the labeling result. Quantitative evaluations were conducted which show significant improvement on spatial continuity.","Liu, Jheng-Lun; Tsai, Augustine; Fuh, Chiou-Shann; Huang, Fay",Geometry and Vision,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971839/,438

To avoid costly sacrifices to mitigate global warming, there is faith that just-in-time technological fixes will enable societies to ride climate changes. Technological improvements of efficiency, robustness, adaptation, and resilience will give humanity capacities to manage whatever nature hurls at society.

Broadly speaking, an IM consists of the use of a mixture of dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques within an interactive data visualization framework. The rationale of creating an IM is the need for simultaneously harnessing the benefit of several DR approaches to reach a data representation being intelligible and/or fitted to any user’s criterion. As a remarkable advantage, an IM naturally provides a generalized framework for designing both interactive DR approaches as well as readily-to-use data visualization interfaces. In addition to a comprehensive overview on basics of data representation and dimensionality reduction, the main contribution of this manuscript is the elegant definition of the concept of IM in mathematical terms.","Ortega-Bustamante, M.

48677,Primary Atrophic Rhinitis: Ozaena and Other Infective Forms,2020-06-10,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease that affects one’s central nervous system. The disease has a number lesion states. One of them is known as active, or enhancing, and indicates that a lesion is under an inflammatory condition. This specific case is of interest to radiologists since it is commonly associated with the period of time a patient suffers most from the effects of MS. To identify which lesions are active, a Gadolinium-based contrast is injected in the patient prior to a magnetic resonance imaging procedure. The properties of the contrast medium allow it to enhance active lesions, making them distinguishable from nonactive ones in T1-w images. However, studies from various research groups in recent years indicate that Gadolinium-based contrasts tend to accumulate in the body after a number of injections. Since a comprehensive understanding of this accumulation is not yet available, medical agencies around the world have been restricting its usage to cases only where it is absolutely necessary. In this work we propose a supervised algorithm to distinguish active from nonactive lesions in FLAIR images, thus eliminating the need for contrast injections altogether. The classification task was performed using textural and enhanced features as input to the XGBoost classifier on a voxel level. Our database comprised 54 MS patients (33 with active lesions and 21 with nonactive ones) with a total of 22 textural and enhanced features obtained from Run Length and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrices. The average precision, recall and F1-score results in a 6-fold cross-validation for active and nonactive classes were 0.892, 0.968, 0.924 and 0.994, 0.987, 0.991, respectively. Moreover, from a lesion perspective, the algorithm misclassified only 3 active lesions out of 157. These results indicate our tool can be used by physicians to get information about active MS lesions in FLAIR images without using any kind of contrast, thus improving one’s health and also reducing the cost of MRI procedures for MS patients.","Freire, Paulo G.

In detail, we analyze the investment decision of a household, who has already invested in a PV plant and has to decide whether and when to invest in the adoption of battery storage systems (BSS). We provide a Real Option Model to determine the value of the opportunity to invest and its optimal timing. The existing PV plant gives the household the opportunity to invest in BSS adoption, and this opportunity is analogous to a call option. Our findings show that negative NPV investments may turn to be profitable if the household optimally exercises the option to defer. The greater the volatility of energy prices, the greater the option value to defer, and the greater the opportunity cost of waiting (i.e., the greater the energy prices drift), the smaller the option value to defer.","D’Alpaos, Chiara; Andreolli, Francesca",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978581/,438

Given the complexity of their work, in particular its constant proximity to patients encountering life-altering events, HWs are at high risk for traumatic, stressful workplace experiences, including the phenomena known in tandem as moral distress/moral anguish (MDA). This chapter offers guidance on therapeutic practice skills needed by social workers (SWs) to help HWs identify and address their experiences of MDA. Case-based vignettes demonstrate how situations encountered within acute care settings challenge personal values and trigger personal memories, heightening the experience of MDA. The vignettes illustrate how two therapeutic approaches can be used to address MDA: reflective cycle (Gibbs, Learning by Doing: A Guide to Teaching and Learning Methods. Further Educational Unit, Oxford Polytechnic, Oxford, 1988) and transformative learning (Mezirow, Fostering Critical Reflection in Adulthood. Jossey-Bass, San Francisco, 1990). Given a medical culture that prioritizes efficiency and often imposes strict time restraints on workers, it is challenging for HWs to reflect on and treat symptoms that indicate MDA. The opportunity for HWs to voice their distress and build self-care strategies represents their path toward healing from the extraordinary pressure and hardship the COVID-19 crisis has brought and toward strengthening their resilience in order to continue their profoundly benevolent work.","Cerone, Victoria L.","Shared Trauma, Shared Resilience During a Pandemic",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978604/,438

Some of these shifts have called into question the role of physical places for face-to-face gatherings, including those used by LGBTQ+ people. Such open questions are a key concern for a book on gayborhoods, so this chapter engages in three analytic tasks to provide preliminary reflections on how pandemics problematize places. While acknowledging a range of threats and challenges that the pandemic poses to the future of LGBTQ+ spaces, this chapter focuses on the potential opportunities and unexpected benefits that COVID-19 can create, running counter to more pessimistic predictions that abound in popular discourse. First, the chapter contextualizes how the COVID-19 pandemic is reminiscent of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, allowing the gayborhood to be well-equipped to respond with grassroots activism, particularly in the face of government inaction or apathy. Second, the chapter explores trends that can ensure the future vitality of LGBTQ+ spaces, including (i) the potential of mutual aid networks, (ii) the power of institutional anchors in LGBTQ+ placemaking efforts, (iii) urban changes related to homesteading and population shifts, (iv) innovations in the interior design of physical spaces, and (v) opportunities to enhance social connections through augmented virtual engagements. Far from signaling the death knell of LGBTQ+ spaces, these trends demonstrate the enduring appeal provided by neighborhoods and communities. Third, the cognitive schemas of lockdowns, re-closeting, and digitalscapes are identified as unique expressions of the shifting spatialities of sexuality in post-pandemic urban space. The chapter concludes by arguing that place will still matter for LGBTQ+ people in a post-COVID-19 era, albeit with altered meanings and material expressions. The socio-spatial consequences of the novel coronavirus will be a confluence of positive and negative developments, and while some will be reversed as soon as an effective vaccine is found, others will linger indelibly in bodies and the built environment for years to come.","Miles, Sam; Coffin, Jack; Ghaziani, Amin; Hess, Daniel Baldwin; Bitterman, Alex",The Life and Afterlife of Gay Neighborhoods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978661/,438

The idea is that literature opens a window to the real world, that, in imagination, we can find a representation of factual events. Various historical and contemporary works of fiction describe societies infected with all sorts of contagious diseases from the bubonic plague in London to AIDS in Africa. Most of these novels can be read as allegories; they demonstrate how people react to illness, social panic, and isolation. They confirm that, although times are changing, the impact of pandemics on individuals does not differ that much. All these works underline that communities can only be based on a humanist approach and solidarity. But they also describe individuals that do not always strive for the common good.

The salience of these orders of worth is roughly homologous with the political economy of each region. In Scotland, ecological and industrial worth are nearly equally common, reflecting the perceived compatibility between tourism and oil development.

This sensitivity incorporates the dialectical and postmodern notion of post-truth as including truths and lies rather than an admission that the quest for truth, however problematic, is altogether relinquished. To think of degrees of hypocrisy in light of degrees of truth refuses the simple and perhaps simple-minded rush to label trivial manifestation of hypocrisy and demands a more nuanced approach to the conditions that may or may not warrant the label of hypocrisy.","Sassower, Raphael",The Specter of Hypocrisy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979898/,438
49382,Data Protection Around the World: Future Challenges,2020-11-21,"Globally, in most countries the deployment and integration of national eHealth programmes is at an advanced stage. Digital progression in society is recognised as inevitable. Consequently, there is a growing awareness amongst nurse leaders for prioritisation of strategies relating to digital leadership and use of informatics competencies within the profession. As artificial intelligence, machine learning and robotics progress at an accelerated rate in society, thought leaders and policy makers turn their attention to consider how such technology can support healthy behaviors and health care delivery. Considerable efficiencies have been realised by deployment of digital in specific business domains such as fast food outlets, the hospitality and transport industries. Automation of passenger check in for example through air travel security has realised better use of staff time in processing of routine tasks and functions. The natural question is can such efficiencies be realised in the domain of healthcare? Large-scale deployment of digital within the health care domain lags somewhat behind other industries. Health administrations engaged with strategic business cases are deliberating on how the digital transformation can assist with planned service improvements from a macro, meso, and micro systems perspective. A key enabler in targeted service planning is the need to advance shared patient centric integrated care through interdisciplinary care service delivery. In this chapter we consider from a practical perspective the seismic impact of digital health, and how it will influence contemporary nursing practice.

49405,Deep Learning for COVID-19 Prognosis: A Systematic Review,2021-01-05,"Social work, and social work education, is increasingly challenged by the changing nature of the globalized environments that it works within. The local and the global are deeply intertwined, leading to complex transnational problems and shared risks that continue to impact heavily on communities. Cultural diversity plays a key role in this, providing a number of opportunities as well as threats to the ways in which people and communities interact. This chapter explores some of the responses of the social work profession in India and Australia to the challenges experienced in the globalized world and discusses these responses in relation to human rights and social justice. The role of community development in this context is then examined, and its relevance to social work education is discussed. We argue that traditional forms of community development have not been very effective at working with diversity and look towards new ways in which professionals can engage with this realm of activity. The chapter closes with an exploration of possible future directions for social work educators to consider.","Gopalkrishnan, Narayan","Social Work Education, Research and Practice",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979975/,438
49448,An Analysis and Evaluation of Open Source Capture the Flag Platforms as Cybersecurity e-Learning Tools,2020-08-16,"The cruise ship industry is one of the fastest-growing segments of the tourism sector. In 2019, the industry transported over 30 million passengers across the world, creating over 1.11 million jobs. In as much as the industry plays such a significant role to global and regional economies, it remains vulnerable to a cocktail of challenges, including disease outbreaks. The chapter documents the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global cruise ship industry. Secondary data and document analyses were the main forms of data collection used, while content and thematic analyses were used to analyse the data. The results showed that the COVID-19 outbreak imposed both economic and human costs to the industry. The outbreak decimated the industry, which saw the value of shipping companies’ stock falling by up to 80% in March 2020, with major sources of revenue shut due to the suspension of cruises. With no bailout packages in many instances, the industry faced bankruptcy and imminent collapse. COVID-19 also left the industry facing several criminal investigations and lawsuits due to passenger infections on board. Some ships were denied access to ports and medical facilities on land due to fear of spreading the virus. Those that got access were not allowed disembarkations, with passengers often quarantined for days or weeks. This resulted in additional infections, trauma and psychological stress of the passengers. Probably the biggest loss the industry has incurred is reputational damage, and this has had the potential to impact negatively on its ability to recover after the COVID-19 shock. Through improved public health standards, aggressive marketing and the offering of massive discounts, the industry has the potential to rebound from the COVID-19 disaster. These stand out as the chapter’s key recommendations.","Nhamo, Godwell; Dube, Kaitano; Chikodzi, David",Counting the Cost of COVID-19 on the Global Tourism Industry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980025/,438

A Case Study on COVID-19 Chest X-Ray Images,2020-07-29,"In late 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was determined in Wuhan, China. The newly emerged epidemic has spread rapidly, with an increasing number of confirmed cases worldwide. While intelligent systems have been immensely tested and implemented across a wide range of health problems, the emergence of COVID-19 requires the need to use these systems in detecting, identifying, and preventing its outbreak. By using the bibliometric analysis approach, this research aims to provide a holistic view on the state-of-the-art research concerning intelligent systems and COVID-19 by analyzing the most used keywords, most cited articles and journals, most productive countries and institutions, most cited authors, and the role of intelligent systems during the COVID-19 outbreak. The results indicated that the existing research studies on intelligent systems during the COVID-19 outbreak have mainly concentrated on the use of machine learning algorithms in identifying and diagnosing the potential COVID-19 cases and predicting its extinction time. However, the number of articles published on the role of intelligent systems during COVID-19 pandemic is relatively few, suggesting that research in this field is still in its early stages, and more intensive research is required.","Al-Emran, Mostafa; Arpaci, Ibrahim",Emerging Technologies During the Era of COVID-19 Pandemic,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980157/,438

Studies involving older adults using these devices are also increasing, but very few have been reported with persons with dementia (PwDs). This is understandable, since there are many barriers for the adoption of this technology by PwDs. Yet, monitoring PwDs activities and behaviors is essential for tracking disease progression and assessing the efficacy of interventions and for safety reasons. This is particularly relevant in nursing homes that are facing severe challenges with the current health crisis due to COVID-19, as one of the means to deal with this is by remote monitoring and tracking, and in general instrumenting them as Ambient Assisted Living spaces. We report on a study in which we conducted a non-pharmacological intervention guided by a social robot in a nursing home with the participation of ten PwDs and six caregivers. The cognitive stimulation therapy lasted for nine weeks, in which participants used a wearable device throughout the day. The data gathered from the devices were useful in obtaining a better understanding of how behaviors changed during the intervention. In particular, we report on the adoption of the wearables by PwDs, the efficacy of the strategies we implemented, and lessons learned.

The current situation with the global pandemic of 2020 has become an objective necessity for the development of levers of digital technologies in medicine. The purpose of this work is to conduct a comprehensive analysis and assessment of the main trends of digital technologies’ implementation in the healthcare system in two main areas—global (most innovative world achievements) and local (national trends). The methods of research are the following: institutional analysis and comparative analysis. The results indicate that digital technologies make it possible to protect doctors and patients from forced contacts and avoid infection with dangerous infectious diseases. The traditional “patient–doctor” model is losing its relevance, and today’s reality forces it to change significantly. Digital technology, together with medical devices, is ushering in a new era in digital health care, and the digitalization of the healthcare system itself is leading to improved delivery of health services, better quality control, and lower costs. The main conclusions are given on the results of implementation of digital technologies in the sphere of health care. Currently, the trends and innovations are evident, which in just a few years will pass from the category of innovative experiments to the rank of attributes necessary for normal functioning in the period of digital transformation. Moreover, the proposed three-level system of decision making, based on the achievements of this period, will allow creating a theoretical basis for a specific situation and minimize the risks of non-optimal outcome.","Osipov, Vladimir S.; Skryl, Tatiana V.",IoT in Healthcare and Ambient Assisted Living,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980852/,438

This evolution has led to multinational enterprises being pivotal in solving a selection of pressing societal issues in health, agriculture and the creation of sustainable livelihoods. Despite the rapid expansion in the number of businesses publishing their CSR and Sustainability reports, progress has been slow and sporadic in businesses across several industries. However, businesses that integrate the three key pillars of sustainable development—social, environmental and economic —provide a foundation on which to build a strategic approach to CSR . Taking an approach informed by sustainability helps businesses have clarity about their purpose . This enables the core business to be in sync with values of the company, internal stakeholders as well as align with expectations of the wider society in which those businesses operate. This shift albeit a gradual one for at least a decade demonstrates how businesses and their stakeholders can drive innovation , future-proof investments and create an enabling environment for enhanced benefits to shareholders as well as other stakeholders. Drawing on examples from the extractive industry, manufacturing and supply chains for consumer goods, this chapter highlights how strategic approaches to CSR and sustainable development can be effective tools in solving pressing issues in society as well as serve as a catalyst to achieve specific Sustainable Development Goals.

49720,How to Argue Well?,2020-09-29,"Analyses of living foraminiferal and environmental parameters near an outfall at Mar Grosso Beach (Laguna, SC, Brazil) demonstrate its usefulness as indicators of domestic sewage pollution. The low species diversity may be due to sand accumulation in the surf zone of the central part that prevents settlement on or in the substrate. Silt and clay content correlates well with the total coliforms higher diversity of foraminiferal species, reduced salinity, and higher temperatures closer to the mouth of Laguna estuarine system indicate freshwater influence, suggesting relationship between increased diversity and greater availability of terrestrial food, even if the salinity decreases. Higher Forams diversity and average coliform values are closer to the mouth of the estuarine system and under the influence of the outfall. The estuary mouth is under the influence of the outfall and exhibits higher foraminiferal diversity and higher mean values of total coliforms and silt-clay content. Due to the effect of local hydrodynamics, the particulate organic waste derived from the outfall settle down locally, accumulating nearby on the southwestern and northwestern parts of the beach. We confirm our hypothesis that the fine material derived from the outfall is accumulating in shallow parts of the beach. In general, the characteristics of the foraminiferal assemblages show that the environment is in the initial stages of eutrophication. Apparently, the nutrient enrichment of the water by the organic waste has induced changes in the benthic foraminiferal community through an increase in species richness. Due to the high energy of the marine environment, however, the particulate organic waste derived from the outfall does not settle down on the seabed; but it supports the hypothesis that the fine material derived from the 12-m deep outfall is accumulated on the southwest part of the beach. The fluctuations in salinity and temperature in Todos os Santos Bay established different tolerance limits for certain species, which indicates that species distribution was subject to natural environmental seasonal changes and excellent water renovation. In the present study, many marine species were observed, indicating a strong influence due to intrusion of marine waters from the adjacent continental shelf. Given that, opportunistic-tolerant species directly benefit from certain kinds of contamination of organic substances, or indirectly, through the reduction of competition and predation, increasing their local occurrence; this chapter reveals this bay as an environment where organic matter is easily deposited, the excess of nutrients results in a low diverse fauna dominated by Ammonia spp. closer to freshwater sources. The occurrence of Elphidium spp. and Quinqueloculina spp. is limited to the eastern part of the TSB. Pseudononion atlanticum and Bolivina spp. presented their occurrence limit in the area under continental runoff influence. A decrease in diversity indicates less stability close to Mataripe River and RLAM area, and an increase in diversity in central and east parts of Todos os Santos Bay. Some areas present aliphatic accumulation, and silt and clay accumulation. Ammonia tepida, Bolivina spp., and Fursenkoina pontoni tolerate sediment with aliphatic and unresolved complex mixture, while Elphidium spp. decreases in areas under the influence of pollutants. Ammonia spp., Bolivina spp., and Fursenkoina pontoni are known organic matter and low oxygen-tolerant foraminifers, and in the bay, they are tolerant to petroleum derived pollutants.","Beck Eichler, Patrícia Pinheiro; Barker, Christofer Paul",Benthic Foraminiferal Ecology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981058/,438

Although these commands may be interpreted as games by participants, it is reasoned that they are situated within sociosexual discourses where sexuality is quantifiable, consent is dependent upon opting out, and sexual agency is dependent upon only one participant in a dyadic encounter activating their sexual agency over the encounter, however mutual the scenario may appear.","Myketiak, Chrystie",Online Sex Talk and the Social World,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981420/,438

Helmholtz is designed on top of our extension of Michelson’s type system with refinement types. Helmholtz takes a Michelson program annotated with a user-defined specification written in the form of a refinement type as input; it then typechecks the program against the specification based on the refinement type system, discharging the generated verification conditions with the SMT solver Z3. We briefly introduce our refinement type system for the core calculus Mini-Michelson of Michelson, which incorporates the characteristic features such as compound datatypes (e.g., lists and pairs), higher-order functions, and invocation of another contract. Helmholtz successfully verifies several practical Michelson programs, including one that transfers money to an account and that checks a digital signature.","Nishida, Yuki; Saito, Hiromasa; Chen, Ran; Kawata, Akira; Furuse, Jun; Suenaga, Kohei; Igarashi, Atsushi",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7984548/,438

An inappropriately activated immune system results in severe myocardial inflammation. Acute immunosuppressive therapy for FVM therefore gained in popularity and was described in numerous retrospective studies. METHODS: We conducted an extensive review of the literature and compared it with our single-centre retrospective review of all cases of FVM from 2009-2019 to evaluate the possible effect of acute immunosuppression with intravenous immunoglobulins and/or high dose corticosteroids in patients with FVM. RESULTS: We report on 17 patients with a mean age of 46 ± 15 years with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15 ± 9% at admission. Fourteen (82%) of our patients had acute LVEF recovery to ≥ 45% after a mean time from immunosuppression of 74 ± 49 hours (3.1 days). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was required in 35% (6/17) of our patients for an average support of 126 ± 37 hours. Overall mortality was 12% (2/17). No patient needed a long-term left ventricular assist device or heart transplant. All surviving patients achieved complete long-term LVEF recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Our cohort of 17 severely ill patients received acute immunosuppressive therapy and showed a rapid LVEF recovery, short duration of ECMO support, and low mortality rate. Our suggested scheme of investigation and treatment is presented. These results bring more cases of successfully treated FVM with immunosuppression and ECMO to the literature, which might stimulate further prospective trials or a registry.","Turgeon, Pierre Yves; Massot, Montse; Beaupré, Frédéric; Belzile, David; Beaudoin, Jonathan; Bernier, Mathieu; Bourgault, Christine; Germain, Valérie; Laliberté, Claudine; Morin, Joëlle; Gervais, Philippe; Trahan, Sylvain; Charbonneau, Éric; Dagenais, François; Sénéchal, Mario",CJC Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7985012/,438

50218,IoT Applications in Manufacturing,2020-09-08,"[Image: see text] The current scenario, an ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, places a dreadful burden on the healthcare system worldwide. Subsequently, there is a need for a rapid, user-friendly, and inexpensive on-site monitoring system for diagnosis. The early and rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in combating the outbreak. Although conventional methods such as PCR, RT-PCR, and ELISA, etc., offer a gold-standard solution to manage the pandemic, they cannot be implemented as a point-of-care (POC) testing arrangement. Moreover, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) having a high enhancement factor provides quantitative results with high specificity, sensitivity, and multiplex detection ability but lacks in POC setup. In contrast, POC devices such as lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) offer rapid, simple-to-use, cost-effective, reliable platform. However, LFIA has limitations in quantitative and sensitive analyses of SARS-CoV-2 detection. To resolve these concerns, herein we discuss a unique modality that is an integration of SERS with LFIA for quantitative analyses of SARS-CoV-2. The miniaturization ability of SERS-based devices makes them promising in biosensor application and has the potential to make a better alternative of conventional diagnostic methods. This review also demonstrates the commercially available and FDA/ICMR approved LFIA kits for on-site diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.","Yadav, Shalu; Sadique, Mohd.

50986,Multi-layered market forecast framework for hotel revenue management by continuously learning market dynamics,2021-03-30,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The objective of this study was to investigate the role of two microenvironmental factors, namely, tumor-intrinsic hypoxia and secretome in inducing collective migration. We utilized three-dimensional (3D) discrete-sized microtumor models, which recapitulate hallmarks of transition of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Tumor-intrinsic hypoxia induced directional migration in large hypoxic microtumors while secretome from large microtumors induced radial migration in non-hypoxic microtumors. This highlights the emergence phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity in cancer cells in response to different microenvironmental stimuli. To unravel mechanisms underlying these two distinct modes of migration, we performed differential gene expression analysis of hypoxia- and secretome-induced migratory phenotypes using non-migratory, non-hypoxic microtumors as controls. We proposed unique gene signature sets related to tumor-intrinsic hypoxia, hypoxia-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as well as hypoxia-induced directional migration and secretome-induced radial migration. ABSTRACT: Collective cell migration is a key feature of transition of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) among many other cancers, yet the microenvironmental factors and underlying mechanisms that trigger collective migration remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated two microenvironmental factors, tumor-intrinsic hypoxia and tumor-secreted factors (secretome), as triggers of collective migration using three-dimensional (3D) discrete-sized microtumor models that recapitulate hallmarks of DCIS-IDC transition. Interestingly, the two factors induced two distinct modes of collective migration: directional and radial migration in the 3D microtumors generated from the same breast cancer cell line model, T47D. Without external stimulus, large (600 µm) T47D microtumors exhibited tumor-intrinsic hypoxia and directional migration, while small (150 µm), non-hypoxic microtumors exhibited radial migration only when exposed to the secretome of large microtumors. To investigate the mechanisms underlying hypoxia- and secretome-induced directional vs. radial migration modes, we performed differential gene expression analysis of hypoxia- and secretome-induced migratory microtumors compared with non-hypoxic, non-migratory small microtumors as controls. We propose unique gene signature sets related to tumor-intrinsic hypoxia, hypoxia-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as well as hypoxia-induced directional migration and secretome-induced radial migration. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis revealed enrichment and potential interaction between hypoxia, EMT, and migration gene signatures for the hypoxia-induced directional migration. In contrast, hypoxia and EMT were not enriched in the secretome-induced radial migration, suggesting that complete EMT may not be required for radial migration. Survival analysis identified unique genes associated with low survival rate and poor prognosis in TCGA-breast invasive carcinoma dataset from our tumor-intrinsic hypoxia gene signature (CXCR4, FOXO3, LDH, NDRG1), hypoxia-induced EMT gene signature (EFEMP2, MGP), and directional migration gene signature (MAP3K3, PI3K3R3). NOS3 was common between hypoxia and migration gene signature. Survival analysis from secretome-induced radial migration identified ATM, KCNMA1 (hypoxia gene signature), and KLF4, IFITM1, EFNA1, TGFBR1 (migration gene signature) to be associated with poor survival rate. In conclusion, our unique 3D cultures with controlled microenvironments respond to different microenvironmental factors, tumor-intrinsic hypoxia, and secretome by adopting distinct collective migration modes and their gene expression analysis highlights the phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity of epithelial cancer cells.","Ardila, Diana Catalina; Aggarwal, Vaishali; Singh, Manjulata; Chattopadhyay, Ansuman; Chaparala, Srilakshmi; Sant, Shilpa",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8004051/,438

Awareness of atypical presentations is critical to facilitate early disease identification. This study aimed to assess how frailty affects presenting symptoms of COVID-19 in older adults. METHODS: Observational study of two distinct cohorts: (i) Hospitalised patients aged 65 and over; unscheduled admission to a large London teaching hospital between March 1st, 2020-May 5th, 2020; COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swab (n = 322); (ii) Community-based adults aged 65 and over enrolled in the COVID Symptom Study mobile application between March 24th (application launch)-May 8th, 2020; self-report or report-by-proxy data; reported test-positive for COVID-19 (n = 535). Multivariable logistic regression analysis performed on age-matched samples of both cohorts to determine associations between frailty and symptoms of COVID-19 including delirium, fever and cough. RESULTS: Hospital cohort: there was a significantly higher prevalence of delirium amongst the frail sample, with no difference in fever or cough. Of those presenting with delirium, 10/53 (18.9%) presented with delirium as the only documented symptom. Community-based cohort: there was a significantly higher prevalence of probable delirium in the frail sample, and also of fatigue and shortness of breath. Of those reporting probable delirium, 28/84 (33%) did not report fever or cough. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a higher prevalence of delirium as a presenting symptom of COVID-19 infection in older adults with frailty compared to their age-matched non-frail counterparts. Clinicians should suspect COVID-19 in frail older adults presenting with delirium. Early detection facilitates infection control measures to mitigate against catastrophic spread and preventable hospitalisations and deaths amongst this population. Our findings emphasise the need for systematic frailty assessment for all acutely ill older patients in both hospital and community settings, as well as systematic evaluation of any change in mental status.","Penfold, R S; Zazzara, M B; Roberts, A L; Lee, K A; Dooley, H; Sudre, C H; Welch, C; Bowyer, R C E; Visconti, A; Mangino, M; Freidin, M B; El-Sayed Moustafa, J S; Small, K; Murray, B; Modat, M; Wolf, J; Ourselin, S; Martin, F C; Steves, C J; Ni Lochlainn, M",Age Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989598/,438

Event study methodology applied to data derived from the 21 industry groups that constitute the Saudi stock market to calculate abnormal returns for the trading days after the announcement of the COVID‐19 in both China and Saudi Arabia. The results indicate that the estimated CARs for the industry groups and their sum on the event day were not statistically significant. Furthermore, the formal announcement of the first case of the COVID‐19 in China had a negative but not significant impact on the Saudi stock market. In contrast, in the first 9‐days event window, the announcement of the first confirmed case in Saudi Arabia had a negative and significant effect. Moreover, the most negatively affected industry groups were banks, consumer services, capital goods, transportation and commercial services, whereas telecommunication services and food and beverage were positively affected at the event window (+1, +9). In general, the Saudi stock market's response had become weaker in the event windows come after (+1, +9), and different industry groups were found to have different responses to the COVID‐19 outbreak.","Sayed, Omer Ahmed; Eledum, Hussein",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8014790/,438

Gastroenterologists can play an important role in IBD care by better understanding trends in patients’ perception of their disease. This study aimed to identify trending topics and misconceptions of disease for early targeted education based off patients’ interactions and activity on social media. METHODS: Utilising an established social media analytics program, we extracted social media posts relating to IBD over a 30-day period between 11/05/2020 and 10/06/2020. The most common hashtags and frequently used words were retrieved from these posts, analysed and qualitatively coded. Additional analysis was performed to evaluate user mentions for specific key words identified from the ECCO consensus for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) and psychotherapy. RESULTS: 22,375 social media posts were reviewed. Twitter was the most common platform with 12,977 posts (58%). Most posts originated from North America and Europe (81%). Amongst common hashtags and words, patients most frequently referenced community groups (n=8094) for example “#crohnswarrior”, followed by terms related to treatment (n=3256), and lifestyle (n=2446). Symptom-related terms were less frequently referenced (n=2031). Of mentions relating to diet and nutrition, ‘gluten free’ was mentioned most frequently (466/2911, 16.0%), followed by ‘vegan’ (374/2911, 12.8%), and ‘plant based’ (342/2911, 11.7%). There was a temporal association with these posts which was demonstrated by hashtags (n=1397) and mentions (n=485) referencing ‘World IBD Day’ which occurred on the 19th of May as well as hashtags (n=391) and mentions (n=1475) referencing the COVID 19 pandemic. Analysis of CAM mentions highlighted patients’ interest in “exercise” as a manipulative and body-based intervention (2015/2088, 96.5%), “cannabinoids” as a herbal and dietary intervention (816/2144, 38.1%) and “yoga” as a mind-body intervention (175/415, 42.2%). 3435 mentions were generated from our psychological key word search. These included terms such as fatigue (28.2%), anxiety (20.1%), depression (13.8%) and suicide (2.2%). CONCLUSION: Our study identified areas where patients’ needs, concerns and queries may be unmet by current clinical practices. Further development of our analytical model can aid gastroenterologists in bridging this gap and providing more holistic patient care.","Kumar, L; Kiely, L; O’Riordan, A; Barry, P",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194665/,438

The aim was to compare how fear of COVID-19 is manifested in people living with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) compared to other GI conditions; and, how fear of COVID-19 is manifested across different demographic backgrounds (employment status, education level and country of residence) among IBD respondents using a large international sample. METHODS: Participants with a GI condition (≥18years of age) were recruited from 22 countries through a web-based questionnaire. Demographic, clinical, and psychosocial information was collected in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. An adaptation of the scale developed for IBD by Trindade & Ferreira (2020) measuring fear of COVID-19 (FoC; original items 1–9) and GI specific fear of COVID-19 (GI-FoC; new items 10–14) was used. RESULTS: In 831 participants (312 IBD), there were no significant differences in FoC between IBD and other GI conditions; whilst significant increases in GI-FoC were found in IBD respondents (mean [SD]: 13.5 [5.5] vs. 10.9 [5.0], p<0.01). The greatest fears of IBD respondents were: their condition would get worse; impact on access to medical support; being at increased risk of getting COVID-19; and being at increased risk of death if they got COVID-19. Among IBD respondents, persons on sick leave had significantly more general FoC than those who were employed, and significantly more GI-FoC compared to the employed or respondents outside of the labour market (Figures 1a and 1b). Persons living in a rural setting had significantly more general FoC and GI-FoC (Figures 2a and 2b). These persons were fearful of contracting COVID-19, having contact with someone with respiratory symptoms, having contact with healthcare professionals, going outside, meeting people, having contact with someone who was in contact with an infected person, having contact with someone infected with COVID-19, and that their IBD means being at increased risk of death if they got COVID-19. There were no differences in general FoC and GI-FoC according to educational background. However, respondents with higher education were less afraid of dying from COVID-19. [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Respondents with IBD are more afraid of the consequences of COVID-19 due to their disease compared to other GI diseases; especially, persons on sick leave or persons living in a rural setting. Persons with higher education were less afraid of dying from COVID-19.

54981,Circular Materials and Circular Design—Review on Challenges Towards Sustainable Manufacturing and Recycling,2021-06-26,"The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective cellular monolayer unique to the microvasculature of the central nervous system (CNS), and it mediates the communication of the CNS with the rest of the body by regulating the passage of molecules into the CNS microenvironment. Limitation of passage of substances through the BBB is mainly due to tight junctions (TJ) and adherens junctions (AJ) between brain microvascular endothelial cells. The importance of actin filaments and microtubules in establishing and maintaining TJs and AJs has been indicated; however, recent studies have shown that intermediate filaments are also important in the formation and function of cell–cell junctions. The most common intermediate filament protein in endothelial cells is vimentin. Vimentin plays a role in blood–brain barrier permeability in both cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions by affecting the actin and microtubule reorganization and by binding directly to VE-cadherin or integrin proteins. The BBB permeability increases due to the formation of stress fibers and the disruption of VE–cadherin interactions between two neighboring cells in various diseases, disrupting the fiber network of intermediate filament vimentin in different ways. Intermediate filaments may be long ignored key targets in regulation of BBB permeability in health and disease.","Bayir, Ece; Sendemir, Aylin",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8226756/,438

In addition to the investigations associated with further broadening of their potential properties, researchers are looking for new raw materials, beneficially originated from renewable resources or recycling. A great example of such a material is ground tire rubber (GTR)—the product of the material recycling of post-consumer car tires. To fully exploit the benefits of this material, it should be modified to enhance the interfacial interactions between PU and GTR. In the presented work, GTR particles were thermo-mechanically modified with the addition of fresh and waste rapeseed oil in the reactive extrusion process. The introduction of modified GTR particles into a flexible PU matrix caused a beneficial 17–28% decrease in average cell diameters. Such an effect caused an even 5% drop in thermal conductivity coefficient values, enhancing thermal insulation performance. The application of waste oil resulted in the superior mechanical performance of composites compared to the fresh one and thermo-mechanical modification without oils. The compressive and tensile performance of composites filled with waste oil-modified GTR was almost the same as for the unfilled foam. Moreover, the introduction of ground tire rubber particles enhanced the thermal stability of neat polyurethane foam.","Kosmela, Paulina; Olszewski, Adam; Zedler, Łukasz; Burger, Paulina; Piasecki, Adam; Formela, Krzysztof; Hejna, Aleksander",Materials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8304020/,438

56461,We Tell These Stories to Survive: Towards Abolition in Computer Science Education,2021-08-05,"Sepsis and meningitis due to invasive group B Streptococcus (iGBS) disease during early infancy is a leading cause of child mortality. Recent systematic estimates of the worldwide burden of GBS suggested that there are 319,000 cases of infant iGBS disease each year, and an estimated 147,000 stillbirths and young-infant deaths, with the highest burden occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa. The following priority data gaps were highlighted: (1) long-term outcome data after infant iGBS, including mild disability, to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) or disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and (2) economic burden for iGBS survivors and their families. Geographic data gaps were also noted with few studies from low- and middle- income countries (LMIC), where the GBS burden is estimated to be the highest. In this paper we present the protocol for a multi-country matched cohort study designed to estimate the risk of long-term neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI), socioemotional behaviors, and economic outcomes for children who survive invasive GBS disease in Argentina, India, Kenya, Mozambique, and South Africa. Children will be identified from health demographic surveillance systems, hospital records, and among participants of previous epidemiological studies. The children will be aged between 18 months to 17 years. A tablet-based custom-designed application will be used to capture data from direct assessment of the child and interviews with the main caregiver. In addition, a parallel sub-study will prospectively measure the acute costs of hospitalization due to neonatal sepsis or meningitis, irrespective of underlying etiology. In summary, these data are necessary to characterize the consequences of iGBS disease and enable the advancement of effective strategies for survivors to reach their developmental and economic potential. In particular, our study will inform the development of a full public health value proposition on maternal GBS immunization that is being coordinated by the World Health Organization.","Paul, Proma; Procter, Simon R.; Dangor, Ziyaad; Bassat, Quique; Abubakar, Amina; Santhanam, Sridhar; Libster, Romina; Gonçalves, Bronner P.; Madhi, Shabir A.; Bardají, Azucena; Mwangome, Eva; Mabrouk, Adam; John, Hima B.; Sánchez Yanotti, Clara; Chandna, Jaya; Sithole, Pamela; Mucasse, Humberto; Katana, Patrick V.; Koukounari, Artemis; Harden, Lois M.; Aerts, Celine; Ghoor, Azra; Leahy, Shannon; Mbatha, Sibongile; Lowick, Sarah; Lala, Sanjay G.; Bramugy, Justina; Newton, Charles; Hossain, A.

Sputum-based diagnosis of TB in patients with low CD4 counts is hampered by paucibacillary disease and consequent sputum scarcity or negative sputum results. Urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) has shown promise in the point-of-care detection of TB in this patient subset but lacks sensitivity, and its exact role in a diagnostic algorithm for TB in South Africa remains to be clarified. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to better define the patient profile and the TB characteristics associated with a positive urine LAM (LAM+ve) test. METHOD: This multicentre retrospective record review examined the clinical, radiological, and laboratory characteristics of hospitalised PLWH receiving urine LAM testing with sputum-scarce and/or negative sputum GeneXpert (®) (mycobacterium tuberculosis/resistance to rifampicin [MTB/RIF]) results. RESULTS: More than a third of patients, 121/342 (35%), were LAM+ve. The positive yield was greater in the sputum-scarce than the sputum-negative group, 66/156 (42%) versus 55/186 (30%), P = 0.0141, respectively. Patients who were LAM+ve were more likely to be confused (odds ratio [OR] = 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2–3.7, P = 0.0045), have a higher median heart rate (P = 0.0135) and an elevated quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment score (≥ 2), OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.6–7.6, P = 0.0014. A LAM+ve test was significantly associated with disseminated TB (dTB), P < 0.0001, TB-related immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), P = 0.0035, and abdominal TB, P < 0.0001. Laboratory predictors of a LAM+ve status included renal dysfunction, P = 0.044, severe anaemia, P = 0.0116, and an elevated C-reactive protein, P = 0.0131. Of the 12 PLWH with disseminated non-TB mycobacteria cultured from the blood and/or bone marrow, n = 9 (75%) had a LAM+ve result (OR = 5.8, 95% CI = 1.6–20.8, P = 0.0053). CONCLUSION: Urine LAM testing of hospitalised PLWH with suspected active TB had significant diagnostic utility in those that were sputum-scarce or sputum-negative. A LAM+ve result was associated with dTB, clinical and laboratory markers of severe illness, and TB-IRIS.

Inspired by marine organism mussels, we designed and manufactured a bio-inspired hydrogel-based bandage with tough wet tissue adhesion to substitute traditional surgical suture, accelerate wound healing and avoid infection. Poly(γ-glutamic acid) was modified with 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and glycidyl methacylate, then introduced into the acrylic acid-co-acrylamide hydrogel matrix with robust mechanical properties. The hydrogel bandage showed strong chemical linkage adhesion (70 ± 2.1 kPa), which is 2.8 times that of commercial tissue adhesive fibrin glue (25 ± 2.2 kPa). The hydrogel bandage can not only maintain the self-stability, but is also capable of self-tuning adhesive strength in the range of 14–70 kPa to achieve different adhesion effects by tuning constituent ratio. The bandage has desirable compression properties (0.7 ± 0.11 MPa) and tensile elongation (about 25 times), which ensures its resistance to damages, especially in joint spaces. Secondly, the bandage was endowed with antioxidant and endogenous broad-spectrum antibacterial properties with its catechol structure. Results also demonstrated excellent cell compatibility and blood compatibility, certifying its eligible biological safety profile. In a rat full-thickness cutaneous deficiency model, we can clearly observe that the bandage possesses the ability to promote wound healing (only need 6 days). Above all, this research provides a new strategy for the emergency treatment of liver hemostasis and myocardial repair during disaster rescue.

Fear of an unknown virus and danger has turned into a feeling of war, which was so familiar and constant in the immediate past of Georgian history: the Soviet‐Union, the 1991–1993 Civil War, the contant threat of Russia which occupied two regions of Georgia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In this paper, I try to explain how the current traumatic situation in Georgia related to Covid‐19 gave après‐coup a new meaning to the transgenerational trauma. I presented the material of two of my patients, whose childhood was affected by the war in Abkhazia (1992–1993), the conflict that followed the declaration of independence of Georgia and led to the Russian occupation of its territories. Because of my contamination with Covid‐19 in transference–countertransference, the Covid turned into an inner conflict. The need and inevitability of informing patients about my infection caused a counter‐transference acting out with paranoid‐schizoïd splitting, projective identifications, unbearable pain and guilt, fear of starvation, and reparation.","Ivanishvili, Khatuna",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8426964/,438

58609,"Special section of business process modeling, development and support (BPMDS) 2019: transformative BPMDS",2021-10-05,"OBJECTIVES: Bisphenol is one of the commercial chemical compounds which finds application in the manufacture of phenol, polyesters, polycarbonates, epoxy resins, etc. Bisphenol A is the most commonly found bisphenol derivative, although there are various analogues such as Bisphenol S, Bisphenol B, Bisphenol C, Bisphenol E, Bisphenol AF, which vary with their structures. Bisphenols majorly get into us by means of food as they are found in food packaging and beverage containers and can be easily absorbed by the body. They can make way into the body systems either by direct means like skin contact or by indirect means through food that is stored in a bisphenol-coated containers. Exposure of the human system to this compound may bring about mild to adverse ailments ranging from skin irritations to infertility. Pigmentation disorder is one such health condition that occurs due to melanocyte destruction and is caused by bisphenol exposures. They interact with various proteins and enzymes that have been involved in the melanocyte synthesis pathway, thereby disrupting their normal functions. METHODS: In silico analysis has been done to predict the interaction and other descriptive binding parameters when the bisphenol derivatives BPA. BPB, BPC, BPE, BPS and BPAF have been docked with some of the essential proteins for melanin synthesis such as tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein 1(TRP-1), dopachrome tautomerase/tyrosinase-related protein-2(TRP-2). RESULTS: The interaction has been quantified with the binding energies, and the interacting amino acid residues have also been identified. The results showed strong interactions for both the proteins TRP-1 and TRP-2 with BPA. BPB, BPC, BPE, BPS and BPAF. CONCLUSIONS: The risk and threats caused by the commercial products made of bisphenol are at higher levels, and thereby, the need for a safe and desirable alternative has been insisted.","Venkatesan, Harinishree; Soundhararajan, Ranjani; Srinivasan, Hemalatha",Toxicol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8493046/,438

In this review, we want to exemplarily illustrate what is known about the interactions of sphingolipids with various viruses at different steps of their replication cycles. This includes structural interactions during entry at the plasma membrane or endosomal membranes, early interactions leading to sphingolipid-mediated signal transduction, interactions with internal membranes and lipids during replication, and interactions during virus assembly and budding. Targeted interventions in sphingolipid metabolism – as far as they can be tolerated by cells and organisms – may open novel possibilities to support antiviral therapies.

As many inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolism are already in clinical use against other diseases, repurposing studies for applications in some viral infections appear to be a promising approach.","Avota, Elita; Bodem, Jochen; Chithelen, Janice; Mandasari, Putri; Beyersdorf, Niklas; Schneider-Schaulies, Jürgen",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8511394/,438
59498,State of Science: The future of work - Ergonomics and Human Factors contributions to the field.,2020-10-23,"Acer monspessulanum L. is an important tree species found in the temperate Zagros forests of Iran. Despite its importance, the long-term persistence of its small and fragmented populations is jeopardised by genetic erosion and hence, monitoring its genetic resource and variability is practically required for providing conservation measures of the species germplasm in Zagros woodland ecosystem. The present study aimed to provide the first data on genetic diversity and genetic differentiation pattern of 19 natural populations comprising 240 individuals of A. monspessulanum across its growing area in Zagros forests using three molecular tools including inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR), start codon targeted (SCoT), and simple sequence repeat (SSR). In total, ISSR and SCoT primers generated a total of 141 and 121 clear and scorable bands for analysis with the polymorphism rate of 90.50 and 90.02% and a mean of 10.85 and 11 fragments per marker, respectively. In addition, 73 alleles were achieved using 10 polymorphic SSR loci from the studied accessions with 100% polymorphism, ranging between 5 and 10 alleles per locus. Average percentage of polymorphic alleles per population for ISSR, SCoT, and SSR data was 84.02%, 83%, and 100%, respectively, and generally, Nei's gene diversity (H) and Shannon's index of diversity (I) values for all populations demonstrated moderate to high levels of genetic diversity (H = 0.267-0.707; I = 0.38-1.38). The AMOVA results of the three marker systems attributed higher genetic variation to individuals within in each population than among populations. Furthermore, overall GST value for all populations detected the moderate to high levels of genetic differentiation, indicating a limited gene flow occurrence among the populations. STRUCTURE analysis (K = 5) clustered the populations into four to five distinct groups, in accordance with geographical distances. These results could represent an important contribution for effective germplasm characterization and could be eventually used in in situ or ex situ conservation of A. monspessulanum genetic resources.","Motahari, Behnaz; Shabanian, Naghi; Rahmani, Mohammad-Shafie; Mohammad-Hasani, Farshad",Gene,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2020.145245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069803/,438
63052,M3Lung-Sys: A Deep Learning System for Multi-Class Lung Pneumonia Screening from CT Imaging.,2020-10-13,"BACKGROUND Providing supplemental oxygen with a blow-by method is used to provide additional oxygen to patients who will not tolerate an oxygen delivery device in direct contact with their face. Blow-by methods are often improvised from parts of standard equipment. The performance is very dependent on the distance to the face and the direction of the gas flow. Blow-by methods are used by anesthetists during transport but their performance in delivering supplemental oxygen has only been tested in static situations. The aim of this nonclinical study was to determine the performance of different blow-by methods in the delivery of additional oxygen to pediatric patients during transport. METHODS A manikin of a child with a facemask of appropriate size was transported along a 60 m corridor from the operating theater to the PACU. Oxygen delivery to the face of the manikin was measured during transport. Six blow-by methods were tested with oxygen flows of 3, 6, and 10 L/min and with the facemask at 0 cm from the face and at 5 cm from the face. The outcome parameter was: blow-by method reaching and maintaining an FiO2 >50% during transport from the pediatric operating theater to the PACU. RESULTS At 0 cm from the face, five out of six blow-by methods maintained a FiO2 >50% with all three flow rates. At 5 cm only two of the blow-by methods were able to maintain an FiO2 >50% and this only at flow rates of 10 L/min. All other blow-by methods provided lower FiO2 s; in three, the FiO2 decreased to values only marginally above 21%. The decrease in FiO2 typically started within 6-12 m from the start of the transport. CONCLUSION It is concluded that the ability of blow-by methods to deliver a FiO2 >50% depends on the method used and distance from the face.","Barends, Clemens R M; Yavuz, Pembegul; Molenbuur, Bouwe; Absalom, Anthony R",Paediatric anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/pan.13515; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30375103/,438
64723,Are People With Chronic Diseases Satisfied With the Online Health Information Related to COVID-19 During the Pandemic?,2020-12-14,"BACKGROUND The indications for conservative ""best medical treatment"" (BMT) versus additional renal artery stenting are a matter of ongoing debate. The RADAR study aimed to evaluate the impact of percutaneous renal artery stenting on the impaired renal function in patients with hemodynamically significant atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS). METHODS RADAR is an international, prospective, randomized (1:1) controlled study comparing BMT alone versus BMT plus renal artery stenting in patients with duplex sonographic hemodynamically relevant RAS. Follow-up assessments were at 2, 6, and 12 months and at 3 years. The primary endpoint was change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 12 months. RESULTS Due to slow enrollment, RADAR was terminated early after inclusion of 86 of the scheduled 300 patients (28.7%). Change in eGFR between baseline and 12 months was 4.3 ± 15.4 ml/min/1.73 m2 (stent group) and 3.0 ± 14.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 (BMT group), p > 0.999. Clinical event rates were low with a 12-month composite of cardiac death, stroke, myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for congestive heart failure of 2.9% in the stent and 5.3% in the BMT group, p = 0.526, and a 3-year composite of 14.8% and 12.0%, p = 0.982. At 3 years, target vessel (re-)vascularization occurred in one patient (3.0%) in the stent group and in 8 patients (29.4%) in the BMT group. CONCLUSION In RADAR, outcomes of renal artery stenting were similar to BMT. These results have to be interpreted with the caveat that the study did not reach its statistically based sample size.

66797,Selecting fermentation products for food waste valorisation with HRT and OLR as the key operational parameters.,2021-04-28,"Protected areas (PAs) are the cornerstone of global conservation policy and have expanded dramatically over the last century. Though unequivocally beneficial for biodiversity, gazetting land for protecting nature can also be seen as an 'opportunity cost' that some politicians are unwilling to pay. One of the most effective strategies to increase the political resilience of PAs in the face of such threats is to demonstrate their broader value to society. This is one of the objectives of the recently proposed 'PA asset framework'. The framework conceptualizes PAs as being composed of suites of biophysical, human, infrastructure, institutional and cultural assets that interact with individuals and institutions to generate different forms of tangible and intangible value. Here, we test the utility of the framework by conducting an asset-based analysis of Brazilian National Parks (NPs) at two different scales (NP system and NP unit). Assets were identified at the system level through a systematic review of 49 Management Plans (MPs) using a typology of PA asset classes as a tool for characterising the presence and state of assets in or associated with NPs. At the NP unit level, assets were identified through semi-structured interviews with local managers of the Chapada Diamantina National Park. Biophysical and infrastructure assets were the most represented asset classes at both scales. Our analysis successfully revealed: (i) which assets can be managed to generate wider forms of values at local scale (e.g. natural spectacles, iconic species, park volunteers) (ii) relational values between assets (e.g. trails and outdoor recreational features), and (iii) value generating practices (VGPs) to capture values from the interaction between different assets (i.e. restoration of degraded areas through voluntary programmes, etc.). We conclude by discussing how the PA asset framework can be operatively integrated into NP management to improve the future allocation of limited financial resources.","Bragagnolo, Chiara; Correia, Ricardo A; Gamarra, Norah Costa; Lessa, Thainá; Jepson, Paul; Malhado, Ana C M; Ladle, Richard J",Journal of environmental management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740748/,438

Zimbabwe has a rich plant biodiversity with only a limited number reported for the treatment of cancer. The leaf extracts of Dolichos kilimandscharicus were selected for the screening of their antiproliferative efficacy and cytotoxicity effects. This plant has increasingly been used by local folk as a treatment for cancer or cancer-related symptoms though its bioactivity has not been scientifically determined. This investigation also sought to identify constituent compounds in the crude extract preparations responsible for their antiproliferative efficacy. The antiproliferative effects of six-leaf extracts on Jurkat-T in vitro were investigated using the Trypan blue exclusion assay. The extracts were tested with increasing concentration, using chlorambucil as a standard anticancer drug. Cytotoxicity of extracts was determined against RAW 264.7 cells using a colorimetric tetrazolium-based assay. In additionthe ability of the extracts to induce apoptosis was determined for the most potent leaf extracts. The order of potency of the leaf extracts of D. kilimandscharicus against Jurkat-T cell line was found to be MeOH < Ethyl Acetate < DCM: MeOH < EtOH with IC50s of 33.56, 30.44, 22.93, and 21.59 μg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, the most potent extracts exhibited very low cytotoxicity against all the tested cells. D. kilimandscharicus leaf extracts induced apoptosis in the Jurkat-T cells as was shown by DNA fragmentation. UPLC-MS analysis of crude extracts led to the identification of 23 compounds from the ethanol extract and these may be responsible for the observed antiproliferative effects. Rutin, quercetin, luteolin, apigenin, hispidulin, kaempferol derivatives, as well as caffeoylquinic acid are some of the compounds identified in the extracts. The results of this study showed that the ethanol and ethyl acetate leaf extracts of D. kilimandscharicus have antiproliferative activity against Jurkat-T cells and may act by inducing apoptosis..

This education intervention aimed to facilitate authentic learning collaborations between PA students and practicing clinicians that would result in higher-order cognition related to the manifestations of social determinants of health and health disparities. METHODS A case study approach was adopted to assess levels of cognition and changes in those levels resulting from application of an innovative blended learning model. Content analysis using Bloom's taxonomy of cognitive domains facilitated determination levels of cognition and changes in those levels. The sample of 8 groups comprised 70 PA students and 8 clinical instructors from community clinics with underrepresented patient populations. RESULTS Analysis of 2 course assignments revealed that application of the C4Tech model yields high levels of cognition. By the course's end, all 8 groups achieved at least the ""evaluate"" level of cognition and half of the groups achieved the highest level of cognition, the ""create"" level. A wide variation in the level of cognition was demonstrated between the first and second assignments in each group and among groups.

A number of stimulus features influence the amount of suppression. A two-mechanism model has been proposed for stationary patterns involving a narrowly-tuned process, requiring very similar stimuli in the centre and surround, and a weaker, untuned or very broadly tuned process unselective for stimulus features. This study examines whether a similar model applies to the motion pathway in human participants by varying the orientation and direction of motion of the surround relative to the centre. Four experienced observers completed a two-interval forced-choice contrast matching task. The stimuli were drifting sinusoidal grating patterns with high contrast surrounds (95%) differing in direction of motion and orientation relative to the centre grating. All surround conditions produced suppression but a common orientation and direction of motion produced significantly more suppression than either opposite direction of motion conditions or orthogonal direction conditions. The tuning for motion direction differences was assessed for same and opposite directions of motion. These findings support the extension of the two-mechanism model of contrast suppression to motion direction.","Phillips, Daisy J; McDougall, Thomas J; Dickinson, J Edwin; Badcock, David R",Vision research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2020.11.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385715/,438

70499,Helen Salisbury: No time for decision making.,2020-04-28,"Purpose Children with cochlear implants (CIs) are more likely to struggle with spoken language than their age-matched peers with normal hearing (NH), and new language processing literature suggests that these challenges may be linked to delays in spoken word recognition. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether children with CIs use language knowledge via semantic prediction to facilitate recognition of upcoming words and help compensate for uncertainties in the acoustic signal. Method Five- to 10-year-old children with CIs heard sentences with an informative verb (draws) or a neutral verb (gets) preceding a target word (picture). The target referent was presented on a screen, along with a phonologically similar competitor (pickle). Children's eye gaze was recorded to quantify efficiency of access of the target word and suppression of phonological competition. Performance was compared to both an age-matched group and vocabulary-matched group of children with NH. Results Children with CIs, like their peers with NH, demonstrated use of informative verbs to look more quickly to the target word and look less to the phonological competitor. However, children with CIs demonstrated less efficient use of semantic cues relative to their peers with NH, even when matched for vocabulary ability. Conclusions Children with CIs use semantic prediction to facilitate spoken word recognition but do so to a lesser extent than children with NH. Children with CIs experience challenges in predictive spoken language processing above and beyond limitations from delayed vocabulary development.

71901,Partha Kar: Changing the narrative around self-management.,2021-04-21,"Tyrosinase, a key copper-containing enzyme involved in melanin biosynthesis, is closely associated with hyperpigmentation disorders, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases, and as such, it is an essential target in medicine and cosmetics. Known tyrosinase inhibitors possess adverse side effects, and there are no safety regulations; therefore, it is necessary to develop new inhibitors with fewer side effects and less toxicity. Peptides are exquisitely specific to their in vivo targets, with high potencies and relatively few off-target side effects. Thus, we systematically and comprehensively investigated the tyrosinase-inhibitory abilities of N- and C-terminal cysteine/tyrosine-containing tetrapeptides by constructing a phage-display random tetrapeptide library and conducting computational molecular docking studies on novel tyrosinase tetrapeptide inhibitors. We found that N-terminal cysteine-containing tetrapeptides exhibited the most potent tyrosinase-inhibitory abilities. The positional preference of cysteine residues at the N terminus in the tetrapeptides significantly contributed to their tyrosinase-inhibitory function. The sulfur atom in cysteine moieties of N- and C-terminal cysteine-containing tetrapeptides coordinated with copper ions, which then tightly blocked substrate-binding sites. N- and C-terminal tyrosine-containing tetrapeptides functioned as competitive inhibitors against mushroom tyrosinase by using the phenol ring of tyrosine to stack with the imidazole ring of His263, thus competing for the substrate-binding site. The N-terminal cysteine-containing tetrapeptide CRVI exhibited the strongest tyrosinase-inhibitory potency (with an IC50 of 2.7 ± 0.5 μM), which was superior to those of the known tyrosinase inhibitors (arbutin and kojic acid) and outperformed kojic acid-tripeptides, mimosine-FFY, and short-sequence oligopeptides at inhibiting mushroom tyrosinase.","Lee, Yu-Ching; Hsiao, Nai-Wan; Tseng, Tien-Sheng; Chen, Wang-Chuan; Lin, Hui-Hsiung; Leu, Sy-Jye; Yang, Ei-Wen; Tsai, Keng-Chang",Molecular pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1124/mol.114.094185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25403678/,438

OBJECTIVE To demonstrate RARPN technique and outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective multicenter study of 227 consecutive RARPNs was performed at the Swedish Medical Center, the University of Michigan, and the University of California, Los Angeles, from 2006 to 2013. SURGICAL PROCEDURE RARPN. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS We assessed positive margins and cancer recurrence. Stepwise regression was used to examine factors associated with complications, estimated blood loss (EBL), warm ischemia time (WIT), operative time (OT), and length of stay (LOS). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS The median age was 60 yr (interquartile range [IQR]: 52-66), and the median body mass index (BMI) was 28.2 kg/m(2) (IQR: 25.6-32.6). Median maximum tumor diameter was 2.3 cm (IQR: 1.7-3.1). Median OT and WIT were 165 min (IQR: 134-200) and 19 min (IQR: 16-24), respectively; median EBL was 75 ml (IQR: 50-150), and median LOS was 2 d (IQR: 1-3). Twenty-eight subjects (12.3%) experienced complications, three (1.3%) had urine leaks, and three (1.3%) had pseudoaneurysms that required reintervention. There was one conversion to radical nephrectomy and three transfusions. Overall, 143 clear cell carcinomas (62.6%) composed most of the histology with eight positive margins (3.5%) and two recurrences (0.9%) with a median follow-up of 2.7 yr. In adjusted analyses, intersurgeon variation was associated with complications (odds ratio [OR]: 3.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-10.27; p = 0.014) and WIT (parameter estimate [PE; plus or minus standard error]: 4.84 ± 2.14; p = 0.025). Higher surgeon volume was associated with shorter WIT (PE: -0.06 ± 0.02; p = 0.002). Higher BMI was associated with longer OT (PE: 2.09 ± 0.56; p < 0.001). Longer OT was associated with longer LOS (PE: 0.01 ± 0.01; p = 0.002). Finally, there was a trend for intersurgeon variation in OT (PE: 18.5 ± 10.3; p = 0.075). CONCLUSIONS RARPN has acceptable morbidity and oncologic outcomes, despite intersurgeon variation in WIT and complications. Greater experience is associated with shorter WIT. PATIENT SUMMARY Robot-assisted retroperitoneoscopic partial nephrectomy has acceptable morbidity and oncologic outcomes, and there is intersurgeon variation in warm ischemia time and complications.","Hu, Jim C; Treat, Eric; Filson, Christopher P; McLaren, Ian; Xiong, Siwei; Stepanian, Sevan; Hafez, Khaled S; Weizer, Alon Z; Porter, James",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2014.04.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24857539/,438

75219,Solid waste management in European countries: a review of systems analysis techniques.,2011,"Public health is attracting increasing attention due to the current global pandemic, and wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has emerged as a powerful tool for monitoring of public health by analysis of a variety of biomarkers (e.g., chemicals and pathogens) in wastewater. Rapid development of WBE requires rapid and on-site analytical tools for monitoring of sewage biomarkers to provide immediate decision and intervention. Biosensors have been demonstrated to be highly sensitive and selective tools for the analysis of sewage biomarkers due to their fast response, ease-to-use, low cost and the potential for field-testing. This paper presents biosensors as effective tools for wastewater analysis of potential biomarkers and monitoring of public health via WBE. In particular, we discuss the use of sewage sensors for rapid detection of a range of targets, including rapid monitoring of community-wide illicit drug consumption and pathogens for early warning of infectious diseases outbreaks. Finally, we provide a perspective on the future use of the biosensor technology for WBE to enable rapid on-site monitoring of sewage, which will provide nearly real-time data for public health assessment and effective intervention.","Mao, Kang; Zhang, Hua; Pan, Yuwei; Yang, Zhugen",Water research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.116787; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33421639/,438
75325,Hesitant Fuzzy Thermodynamic Method for Emergency Decision Making Based on Prospect Theory.,2017,"SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, a variant first detected in the UK in September 20201, has spread to multiple countries worldwide. Several studies have established that B.1.1.7 is more transmissible than preexisting variants, but have not identified whether it leads to any change in disease severity2. Here we analyse a dataset linking 2,245,263 positive SARS-CoV-2 community tests and 17,452 COVID-19 deaths in England from 1 September 2020 to 14 February 2021. For 1,146,534 (51%) of these tests, the presence or absence of B.1.1.7 can be identified because of mutations in this lineage preventing PCR amplification of the spike gene target (S gene target failure, SGTF1). Based on 4,945 deaths with known SGTF status, we estimate that the hazard of death associated with SGTF is 55% (95% CI 39-72%) higher after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, care home residence, local authority of residence and test date. This corresponds to the absolute risk of death for a 55-69-year-old male increasing from 0.6% to 0.9% (95% CI 0.8-1.0%) within 28 days after a positive test in the community. Correcting for misclassification of SGTF and missingness in SGTF status, we estimate a 61% (42-82%) higher hazard of death associated with B.1.1.7. Our analysis suggests that B.1.1.7 is not only more transmissible than preexisting SARS-CoV-2 variants, but may also cause more severe illness.","Davies, Nicholas G; Jarvis, Christopher I; Edmunds, W John; Jewell, Nicholas P; Diaz-Ordaz, Karla; Keogh, Ruth H",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03426-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33723411/,438
76370,Is there a role for haematopoietic cell transplants after radiation and nuclear accidents.,2021-03-02,"BACKGROUND Group antenatal care has been successfully implemented around the world with suggestions of improved outcomes, including for disadvantaged groups, but it has not been formally tested in the UK in the context of the NHS. To address this the REACH Pregnancy Circles intervention was developed and a randomised controlled trial (RCT), based on a pilot study, is in progress. METHODS The RCT is a pragmatic, two-arm, individually randomised, parallel group RCT designed to test clinical and cost-effectiveness of REACH Pregnancy Circles compared with standard care. Recruitment will be through NHS services. The sample size is 1732 (866 randomised to the intervention and 866 to standard care). The primary outcome measure is a 'healthy baby' composite measured at 1 month postnatal using routine maternity data. Secondary outcome measures will be assessed using participant questionnaires completed at recruitment (baseline), 35 weeks gestation (follow-up 1) and 3 months postnatal (follow-up 2). An integrated process evaluation, to include exploration of fidelity, will be conducted using mixed methods. Analyses will be on an intention to treat as allocated basis. The primary analysis will compare the number of babies born ""healthy"" in the control and intervention arms and provide an odds ratio. A cost-effectiveness analysis will compare the incremental cost per Quality Adjusted Life Years and per additional 'healthy and positive birth' of the intervention with standard care. Qualitative data will be analysed thematically. DISCUSSION This multi-site randomised trial in England is planned to be the largest trial of group antenatal care in the world to date; as well as the first rigorous test within the NHS of this maternity service change. It has a recruitment focus on ethnically, culturally and linguistically diverse and disadvantaged participants, including non-English speakers.

78962,"Physical distancing and non-respiratory notifiable diseases in the Northern Territory, March-May 2020.",2020-10-25,"Climate change is impacting food and beverage crops around the world with implications for environmental and human well-being. While numerous studies have examined climate change effects on crop yields, relatively few studies have examined effects on crop quality (concentrations of nutrients, minerals, and secondary metabolites). This review article employs a culturally relevant beverage crop, tea (Camelia sinensis), as a lens to examine environmental effects linked to climate change on the directionality of crop quality. Our systematic review identified 86 articles as relevant to the review question. Findings provide evidence that shifts in seasonality, water stress, geography, light factors, altitude, herbivory and microbes, temperature, and soil factors that are linked to climate change can result in both increases and decreases up to 50% in secondary metabolites. A gap was found regarding evidence on the direct effects of carbon dioxide on tea quality, highlighting a critical research area for future study. While this systematic review provides evidence that multiple environmental parameters are impacting tea quality, the directionality and magnitude of these impacts is not clear with contradictory evidence between studies likely due to confounding factors including variation in tea variety, cultivar, specific environmental and agricultural management conditions, and differences in research methods. The environmental factors with the most consistent evidence in this systematic review were seasonality and water stress with 14 out of 18 studies (78%) demonstrating a decrease in concentrations of phenolic compounds or their bioactivity with a seasonal shift from the spring and /or first tea harvest to other seasons and seven out of 10 studies (70%) showing an increase in levels of phenolic compounds or their bioactivity with drought stress. Herbivory and soil fertility were two of the variables that showed the greatest contradictory evidence on tea quality. Both herbivory and soil fertility are variables which farmers have the greatest control over, pointing to the importance of agricultural management for climate mitigation and adaptation. The development of evidence-based management strategies and crop breeding programs for resilient cultivars are called for to mitigate climate impacts on crop quality and overall risk in agricultural and food systems.","Ahmed, Selena; Griffin, Timothy S; Kraner, Debra; Schaffner, M Katherine; Sharma, Deepak; Hazel, Matthew; Leitch, Alicia R; Orians, Colin M; Han, Wenyan; Stepp, John Richard; Robbat, Albert; Matyas, Corene; Long, Chunlin; Xue, Dayuan; Houser, Robert F; Cash, Sean B",Frontiers in plant science,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2019.00939; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31475018/,438

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between January 2008 and August 2011, 381 consecutive robotic partial nephrectomies were retrospectively included. Two groups of patients were identified: those who underwent the procedure for an imperative indication (n = 98) and those who underwent the procedure for an elective indication (n = 283). Perioperative and renal function outcomes were compared between the 2 groups. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine whether imperative indications were predictors of complications, chronic kidney disease stage upstaging, postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate, and percentage of estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease. RESULTS There were no differences between the 2 groups with respect to RENAL score and tumor size. Patients in the imperative group were more likely to have a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score (6 vs 4, P < .001), higher chronic kidney disease stage (P < .001), and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (61.9 vs 88.6 mL/min/1.73 m(2), P < .001). Perioperative outcomes were similar with respect to warm ischemia time, estimated blood loss, operative time, transfusion rate, positive surgical margin rate, and length of stay. Imperative indications were associated with higher major complication rate (7.22% vs 2.47%, P = .032), but not with overall (31.6% vs 26%, P = .62) and intraoperative complications (6.1% vs 3.2%, P = .22). In multivariate analysis, imperative indication was an independent predictor of postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate but was not a predictor of percentage of estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease and chronic kidney disease upstaging. CONCLUSION Patients undergoing robotic partial nephrectomy for an imperative indication have similar functional outcomes than those with an elective indication. However, they are at higher risk of major complications.","Long, Jean-Alexandre; Lee, Byron; Eyraud, Remi; Autorino, Riccardo; Hillyer, Shahab; Stein, Robert J; Kaouk, Jihad H; Haber, Georges-Pascal",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2012.06.045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23021664/,438
85820,Confusion over Europe's data-protection law is stalling scientific progress.,2020-08-01,"Pneumonia due to either Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) or Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) accounts for most mortality after influenza and acute respiratory illness (ARI). Because carriage precedes infection, we estimated Sp and Sa carriage to examine the co-colonization dynamics between Sp, Sa and respiratory viruses in the presence of ARI in the oropharynx. We tested oropharyngeal specimens of community subjects (aged ⩾2 years) with ARI for the presence of influenza A and B, 11 other common respiratory viruses, Sp and Sa, using real-time PCR. A total of 338 participants reported 519 ARI episodes of which 119 (35%) carried Sp, 52 (13%) carried Sa and 25 (7%) carried both. Thirty-five subjects tested positive for influenza, of which 14 (40%) carried Sp and six (17%) carried Sa, significantly more than in the influenza-negative group (P = 0·03 and P = 0·04, respectively). In subjects infected by any virus compared to those with no virus, Sp carriage (39·2% vs. 27·9%, P = 0·03) but not Sa carriage (11·6% vs. 14%, P = 0·6) was more frequent. For children, when Sa was present, Sp carriage tended to be less frequent than expected given the presence of viral infection, but not significantly [observed relative risk 1·14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0·4-3·1; with a relative excess risk due to interaction of -0·11]. Independent of age, Sp carriers were more likely to return that season with subsequent ARI (odds ratio 2·14, 95% CI 1·1-4·3, P = 0·03). Both Sp and Sa carriage rates in the oropharynx increase during influenza infection in children. However, no negative interaction between Sp and Sa was observed. Sp carriers are more likely to suffer subsequent ARI episodes than non-carriers.","DE Lastours, V; Malosh, R; Ramadugu, K; Srinivasan, U; Dawid, S; Ohmit, S; Foxman, B",Epidemiology and infection,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268816001473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27535335/,438

Strict inclusion criteria consist of the following: no intercostal incisions greater than 5 mm, 12 mm subxiphoid port, subxiphoid removal of the specimen, total endoscopic technique with CO2 insufflation, vision through a 5-mm camera, stapling via the subxiphoid port, or with 5-mm stapling devices. METHODS The combined early experiences of six hospitals from three countries were combined from September 2014 to May 2016. During that time, the study represents a consecutive cohort study of this technique. RESULTS Seventy-two patients underwent microlobectomy. The median (range) age was 66 (27-82). Half of the patients were female. There were 48 right-sided resections and 24 on the left. There were four segmental resections and there was one right pneumonectomy. Four operations were performed robotically (with 8-mm intercostal incisions). The median (range) operative time was 180 (94-285) minutes and the blood loss was 118 (5-800) mL. There were three conversions to thoracotomy and two conversions to videoscopic-assisted thoracic surgery by means of an intercostal utility incision to complete the operation. The median (range) length of stay was 3 (1-44) days and 30 patients (42%) when home by day 2 and 16 patients (22%) were discharged on day 1. There were no deaths. Five patients (7%) had a prolonged airleak. There were no wound infections and there was one incisional hernia. CONCLUSIONS We believe that microlobectomy is an interesting novel form of videoscopic-assisted thoracic surgery lobectomy and has several theoretical advantages. We have presented our early results and hope that this will stimulate others to investigate this type of videoscopic-assisted thoracic surgery lobectomy further.","Dunning, Joel; Elsaegh, Mohamed; Nardini, Marco; Gillaspie, Erin A; Petersen, Rene Horsleben; Hansen, Henrik Jessen; Helsel, Bryan; Naase, Hatam; Kornaszewska, Malgorzata; Will, Malcolm B; Walker, William S; Wigle, Dennis; Blackmon, Shanda Haley",Innovations,https://doi.org/10.1097/imi.0000000000000394; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28763351/,438

In Estonia, seasonal influenza vaccination coverage is poor, being in recent years the lowest in the older age groups. In 2018 the flu vaccination was first provided at community pharmacies in Estonia. The aims of this study were to evaluate the experience of flu vaccination at community pharmacies by pharmacy customers and to learn about the perception of community pharmacists regarding the immunization service. METHOD . Two cross-sectional surveys: among pharmacy customers after receiving flu vaccination (n=257), and for pharmacy professionals (n=209). Descriptive statistics were calculated in both studies. RESULTS . In the pharmacy customers` study, 54.9% received flu vaccination for the first time. Most of the respondents (96.8%) were satisfied with the quality of service. In both studies, community pharmacies were described as an accessible and convenient setting for immunization. Age and working experience of pharmacy professionals influenced the readiness to provide flu immunization, with younger pharmacists (<36 years) keener to be involved in vaccination services (p<0.01). CONCLUSION . Vaccination service at community pharmacy has a great potential to expand flu immunization coverage in Estonia. Despite on pharmacy professionals are not allowed to provide vaccination service at the moment, their contribution to increase public awareness about flu vaccination is significant.","Sepp, Kristiina; Kukk, Carmen; Cavaco, Afonso; Volmer, Daisy",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2020.1825949; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32940097/,438

Sustainable nutrition, or sustainable diet, refers to diets with low environmental impacts that contribute to food security and health. This systematic review aimed to identify factors that influence whether professionals in health-related institutions integrate sustainable nutrition into their practice. METHODS A mixed-methods systematic review was conducted using the MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases. To be included, the studies had to document perspectives on sustainable nutrition from health professionals, including dietitians, students and educators in health sciences, public health officers, and hospital food service managers. Data extraction focused on perceived barriers, facilitating factors, and top recommendations for promoting sustainable nutrition. SYNTHESIS Twenty studies were included, most of which focused on dietitians. Data analysis revealed that 25 factors influenced the integration of sustainable nutrition into professional practice. The factors most reported in the included studies were perceived knowledge of sustainable nutrition, self-efficacy, awareness of environmental issues, and perceiving the promotion of sustainable nutrition to be part of one's professional role. Increasing societal support through awareness campaigns and increasing institutional support through guidelines, information tools, and financial support were also frequently mentioned. CONCLUSION Sustainable nutrition is a multifaceted concept; integrating it into already complex professional practices is therefore challenging. At the present time, dietitians seem to be the health professionals predominantly researched regarding their views on sustainable nutrition. Many concrete avenues to promote sustainable nutrition were identified through this review.","Guillaumie, Laurence; Boiral, Olivier; Baghdadli, Amel; Mercille, Geneviève",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,https://doi.org/10.17269/s41997-020-00394-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32959328/,438

The aim of this study is to retrospectively analyze the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic partial splenectomy (LPS) in selected emergency patients.From January 2013 to December 2015, there were 46 emergency patients, diagnosed with splenic rupture, admitted in our department. Selection criteria for LPS: (1) Preoperative CT scan revealed single pole rupture without spleen pedicle injury; (2) BP>90/60 mm Hg and heart rates <120 bpm; (3) No sigh of multiple organ injury. Eventually, LPS was performed in 21 patients (Group LPS), while laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) was performed in 20 patients (Group LS).The main cause of splenic rupture was traffic accident, followed by blunt injury and high falling injury. Abdominal CT scan showed the mean longitudinal diameter of spleen of group LPS was 14.2 ± 1.8 cm (range 12-17 cm), while the size of remnant spleen was 5.5 ± 1.2 cm. Between 2 groups, operation time (LPS: 122.6 ± 17.2 min vs LS: 110.5 ± 18.7 minutes, P = .117), and intraoperative blood loss (LPS: 174 ± 22 mL vs LS: 169 ± 29 mL, P = .331) were similar. There were 2 patients suffered subsequent unstable vital sign altering during mobilization when performing LPS. Conversion to LS (2/21, 9.52%) was decided and successfully completed. Although there was no patient suffered postoperative OPSI or thrombocytosis events in both groups after 6-month follow-up, the mean platelets and leukocyte count were significantly lower in group LPS. Splenic regrowth was evaluated in 20 patients of group LPS. And the mean regrowth of splenic volume reached 19% (10%-26%).Due to its minimal invasive effect and functional splenic tissue preservation, LPS may be a safe and feasible approach for emergency patients.

Despite worldwide calls for social distancing and containment, the incidence of the disease continues to increase. COVID-19 is a respiratory tract infection caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2). Preliminary analyses from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention indicated an overall case fatality rate (CFR) of 2.3%; however the CFR was higher in older adults (14.8% in those 80± years) and 49% of all critical cases. Those with preexisting conditions (cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer) also had higher CRFs. In the United States, 116 million adults have hypertension, 26 million US adults have diabetes mellitus, 9% have preexisting CVD and may therefore be at greater risk of complications or adverse health outcomes from COVID-19 infection.","Alger, Heather M; Williams Iv, Joseph H; Walchok, Jason G; Bolles, Michele M; Fonarow, Gregg C; Rutan, Christine",Circulation.

AIM To describe the operations performed by us, considering complications and their management. MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed 565 laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomies. Standard surgical technique was used. A 34 Fr calibration tube was used. An additional reinforcing suture was applied over the staple line. RESULTS There was no need for conversion. In 7.79% of patients, infarcts of the posterior pole of the spleen were observed, whereas 8 patients (1.42%) developed gastric fistulas in the His angle region. In 3 cases, it led to development of an abscess in the posterior splenic pole region and 2 of these developed secondary gastric fistulas of typical location. In total, there were 5 deaths among the patients who had been operated on - 3 due to septic complications in the course of fistula, 1 due to encephalopathy and 1 as a result of myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS Sleeve gastrectomy is an effective and safe method of obesity treatment. The causes of the most severe complication - gastric fistula - cannot be established unequivocally. Infarcts of the posterior pole of the spleen, as a potential cause of fistulas, deserve particular attention. In our opinion, primary closure of the fistula by suturing is an inappropriate method of management, whereas the best results are obtained with temporary gastrointestinal tract prosthesis.","Szewczyk, Tomasz; Janczak, Przemyslaw; Janiak, Adam; Gaszyński, Tomasz; Modzelewski, Bogdan",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2014.44167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25337169/,438

An intraoperative endoscopic assessment of the anastomosis allows immediate evaluation regarding bleeding and possible leakage. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of routine intraoperative endoscopy on postoperative complications. METHODS Since May 1999, data of all laparoscopic colon resections were collected in a prospective database. Since July 2007, we assessed every circular-stapled anastomosis with a flexible endoscope for bleeding, integrity of mucosa, and leakage. The patients with (+) and without (-) routine endoscopic assessment were compared regarding postoperative complications. RESULTS Group(-) consisted of 253 patients [133 male, 120 female; mean age, 60 years (25 to 86 y)] and group(+) consisted of 85 patients [44 male, 41 female; mean age, 62 years (22 to 87 y), P=not significant] In group(-), postoperative anastomotic bleeding was diagnosed in 11 patients (4.3%) and 7 (2.8%) of these patients required endoscopic assessment and clipping. In group(+), endoscopy showed anastomotic bleeding in 5 patients (5.9%) at the time of surgery, which required clipping. Anastomotic leak was observed in 2 patients (2.4%): in one patient the circular staple line was oversewn and in the other patient anastomosis was redone. Two (2.4%) patients in group(+) had postoperative anastomotic bleeding requiring reendoscopy and clipping. The postoperative leakage rate was not significantly different in both the groups [(-)1.6%, (+)1.2%, P= not significant]. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative endoscopic assessment of circular-stapled anastomosis can detect early anastomotic bleeding and leakage. Although the postoperative rate of bleeding and leakage was not significantly reduced in our study, we still recommend endoscopic assessment of the circular-stapled anastomosis as a routine procedure in colorectal surgery, as the benefits outweigh the risks.","Shamiyeh, Andreas; Szabo, Kornel; Ulf Wayand, Wolfgang; Zehetner, Joerg","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e3182401e20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22318063/,438

105603,Treatment of latent M. tuberculosis infection and use of antiretroviral therapy to prevent tuberculosis.,2020-08-24,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes severe economic losses in the pig industry worldwide. Currently, vaccines based on inactivated PRRSV provide limited protection of pigs against infection, most likely because viral epitopes associated with the induction of neutralizing antibodies are not or poorly conserved during inactivation. To analyze the effect of inactivation procedures on the interaction of PRRSV with receptors involved in virus entry, a new assay was set up in this study. Viral entry-associated domains are most likely important for the induction of neutralizing antibodies, since neutralizing antibodies block interaction of PRRSV with cellular receptors. To investigate the interaction of PRRSV with the cellular receptors upon different inactivation procedures, attachment to and internalization of inactivated PRRSV into macrophages were monitored. AT-2 could not inactivate PRRSV completely and is therefore not useful for vaccine development. PRRSV inactivated with ultraviolet light, binary ethyleneimine and gamma irradiation, which all mainly have an effect at the genomic level, showed no difference compared to control live virus at all levels of virus entry, whereas PRRSV treated with formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and pH changes, which all have a modifying effect on proteins, was not able to internalize into macrophages anymore. These results suggest that inactivation with methods with a main effect on the viral genome preserve PRRSV entry-associated domains and are useful for future development of an effective inactivated vaccine against PRRSV. Although PRRSV incubation at 37 degrees C can completely inactivate PRRSV with preservation of entry-associated domains, this method is not recommended for vaccine development, since the mechanism is yet unknown.","Delrue, Iris; Delputte, Peter L; Nauwynck, Hans J",Veterinary research,https://doi.org/10.1051/vetres/2009047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19674538/,438

Our aim was to report our experience of a stent-assisted coiling technique with double stents in ""Y"" and ""X"" configurations, with emphasis on safety, feasibility, and efficacy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical and angiographic outcomes of patients for whom the strategic therapeutic option was the stent-assisted coiling technique in a Y or X configuration for neck scaffolding from June 2006 to June 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS One hundred five aneurysms in 97 patients were treated during 100 consecutive procedures. There were 54.2% (57/105) MCA, 28.6% (30/105) anterior communicating artery, 16.2% (17/105) basilar tip, and 1.0% (1/105) ICA termination aneurysms. A Y stent placement was used to treat 87 aneurysms in 85 procedures; an X stent placement was used to treat 7 aneurysms in 6 procedures, while 9 procedures failed for 11 aneurysms. There were 10.0% (10/100) procedure-related permanent neurologic deficits and 1.0% (1/100) death. The immediate angiographic controls showed a complete occlusion in 47.6% (50/105) of the aneurysms and a partial (neck or sac remnant) occlusion in 52.4% (55/105). To date, 81.0% (85/105) of the aneurysms have been followed up (mean, 17 months) with angiography, disclosing a recanalization in 5.9% (5/85) and an improvement in 42.4% (36/85). At discharge and follow-up, the mRS score was 0 in 83.5% (81/97) of patients, 1 in 4.1% (4/97), 2 in 3.1% (3/97), 3 in 4.1% (4/97), 4 in 3.1% (3/97), and 6 in 2.1% (2/97).

Surgical resection is the standard treatment, but there are no evidence-based guidelines regarding the management of these tumours. Methods Five databases were searched from inception to April 1, 2019 for studies reporting on SFTP management. Results Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria (1542 patients, all non-comparative case series); 98% of these patients underwent resection and all SFTP included were pathologically diagnosed. 394 out of 1299 cases (30.5%, 95% CI 27.8-32.8%) were malignant with recurrence rates of between 0% and 42.9%. A pleural effusion was always associated with a negative outcome, but no other features were consistently reported to have negative associations. Preoperative biopsies incorrectly reported malignant histology in two studies. Over 25% of cases of recurrence occurred when a complete (R0) resection had been achieved. The first recurrence occurred >5 years after the initial resection in at least 23% of cases. Conclusions There is strong evidence to support long-term surveillance after surgical resection of SFTP, even where a complete (R0) resection has been achieved; however, there is no clear evidence to inform clinicians regarding the selection of patients who should undergo resection. The rates of malignant SFTP and SFTP recurrence are higher than previously reported. Only those that were pathologically diagnosed or resected were included, which may bias the data towards more aggressive tumours. Data collection on radiologically diagnosed SFTP is required to draw conclusions regarding the timing and need for intervention.","Mercer, Rachel M; Wigston, Charlotte; Banka, Radhika; Cardillo, Giuseppe; Benamore, Rachel; Nicholson, Andrew G; Asciak, Rachelle; Hassan, Maged; Hallifax, Robert J; Wing, Louise; Bedawi, Eihab O; Maskell, Nick A; Harriss, Elinor K; Miller, Robert F; Rahman, Najib M",ERJ open research,https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00055-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832532/,438

Understanding the underlying mechanisms and developing innovative treatments are extremely urgent. G-quadruplexes (G4s) are important non-canonical nucleic acids structures with distinct biofunctions. Here, we studied four putative G4-forming sequences (PQSs) in SARS-CoV-2 genome. One of them (namely RG-1), which locates in the coding sequence (CDS) region of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), has been verified to form stable RNA G4 structure in live cells. G4-specific compounds, such as PDP, can stabilize RG-1 G4 and significantly reduce the protein levels of SARS-CoV-2 N by inhibiting its translation bothin vitro andin vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that PQSs in SARS-CoV-2 can form G4 structures in live cells, and their biofunctions can be regulated by G4-specific stabilizer.

METHODS A prospective, multicentre series was conducted at 11 interventional centres in Europe to evaluate embolisation of bAVMs with the new liquid embolic agent. Technical conditions, complications, clinical outcome and anatomical results were independently analysed. RESULTS From December 2005 to December 2008, 117 patients (72 male; 45 female, aged 18-75 years) were included. Clinical presentation was mostly haemorrhage (34.2 %) and seizures (28.2 %). Most AVMs were located in the brain hemispheres (85.5 %). AVMs were <3 cm in 52.1 % of patients and ≥ 3 cm in 47.9 %. Morbidity was observed in 6/117 patients (5.1 %), related to haemorrhagic events in 2 cases and non-haemorrhagic complications in 4 cases. Five patients (4.3 %) died in relation to the treatment (bleeding in 4 patients and extensive venous thrombosis in 1). Complete occlusion of the AVM by embolisation alone was obtained in 23.5 % of patients. Complementary treatment was performed in 82.3 % of patients with partial AVM occlusion, mostly radiosurgery. CONCLUSIONS In this prospective, multicentre, European, observational series, the new liquid embolic agent proved to be suitable for BAVM embolisation, with acceptable morbidity and mortality and good efficacy. KEY POINTS • Numerous interventional techniques have been used to embolise brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). • This prospective multicentre study demonstrates the suitability of a liquid embolic agent. • The safety of treatment using Onyx is acceptable. • Such embolisation leads to complete AVM occlusion in 23.5 % of patients.","Pierot, L; Cognard, C; Herbreteau, D; Fransen, H; van Rooij, W J; Boccardi, E; Beltramello, A; Sourour, N; Kupcs, K; Biondi, A; Bonafé, A; Reith, W; Casasco, A",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-013-2870-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23652849/,438

124512,Reframing sociotechnical imaginaries: The case of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.,2021-05-16,"BACKGROUND Recurrent prolapse after stapled haemorrhoidopexy is a late complication of the procedure which can present with accompanying symptoms and may require surgery. We describe a technique for treating symptomatic patients, aimed at obtaining remission of symptoms and avoiding recurrences. METHODS After excisional haemorrhoidectomy, a transverse incision is performed on the proximal part of the mucocutaneous bridge, above the plane of the internal sphincter. A flap of anal mucosa is gently raised. Haemorrhoidal tissue is not removed. LigaSure™ may be useful in focussing coagulation and reducing heat diffusion. Denudation of the internal sphincter allows the removal of potential retained staples. Then, stitches are placed between the proximal part of the flap and the proximal divided edge of the rectal mucosa. Excessive devascularisation of the flap must be avoided. RESULTS From January 2007 to January 2011, we treated 11 patients. The procedures lasted a mean of 38.2 ± 11.1 min. One patient (9 %) suffered from bleeding during the night before being discharged, but this did not require surgery, and another (9 %) had urinary retention. No other perioperative complications were observed. The mean visual analogue scale score 1 day and 1 week after surgery was 4.7 ± 1.3 and 2.3 ± 0.5, respectively. At mean follow-up of 4 ± 1.8 years, neither symptomatic nor asymptomatic recurrences have been observed. Two out of three patients presenting with urgency reported regression of symptoms (66.7 %). In all patients suffering from pain after stapled haemorrhoidopexy, the procedure achieved pain relief (2/2, 100 %). No stenoses occurred. CONCLUSIONS This technique is a promising alternative after failed stapled haemorrhoidopexy. Morbidity is low. The procedure may effectively treat associated symptoms.","Selvaggi, F; Pellino, G; Sciaudone, G",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-014-1180-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24957359/,438

In particular, the technique for esophagojejunostomy remains controversial. We performed 103 cases of LTG for patients with gastric cancer between 2007 and 2013, in which all esophagojejunostomy reconstruction was performed with intracorporeal circular stapling esophagojejunostomy using the OrVil system except for the first 3 cases. The purpose of this study is to retrospectively analyze the clinical usefulness of LTG with intracorporeal circular stapling esophagojejunostomy using the OrVil system and oncological feasibility of LTG as compared with open total gastrectomy (OTG). PATIENTS AND METHOD We retrospectively analyzed clinical course of consecutive 100 operations with LTG in comparison with consecutive 53 operations with OTG for patients with gastric cancer. As an estimation of short-term outcome, operative time, blood loss, postoperative hospital days and postoperative data of blood and drain examination were included. Moreover, relapse-free survival time and overall survival time stratified by each stage were calculated by log-rank test as an estimation of prognostic relevance. RESULTS Blood loss and postoperative hospital stay of LTG were significantly less than that of OTG. Postoperative complications were equivalent between the 2 groups and no patient died within 1 month post-LTG. Only 1 patient had recurrence and died for carcinomatosa peritonitis 50 months after LTG (median follow-up period: 44 mo).

METHODS Official epidemiological data on COVID-19 were employed. The forward lagged (0, 3, 7, 14 days) daily variations in the number of deaths according to the number of days after the outbreak started and the daily increases in ICU admissions were estimated. RESULTS A direct relationship between the sharp increase of ICU admissions and mortality rates has been shown. Furthermore, the analysis of the forward lagged daily variations in the number of deaths showed that an increase in the daily number of ICU admissions resulted in significantly higher mortality after 3, 7, and 14 days. The most pronounced effect was detected after 7 days, with 250 deaths (95% C.I. 108.1-392.8) for the highest increase in the ICU admissions -from 100 to 200. CONCLUSIONS These results would serve as a warning for the scientific community and the health care decision-makers to prevent a quick and out-of-control saturation of the ICU beds in case of a relapse of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Lorenzoni, Giulia; Azzolina, Danila; Acar, Aslihan Şentürk; Silvestri, Luciano; Berchialla, Paola; Gregori, Dario",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.314; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34649630/,438

METHODS The transport of eight β-blockers across excised sclera/sclera-choroid-RPE (SCRPE) of albino rabbit, pigmented rabbit, human, porcine, and bovine eyes was determined over 6 hours. The ex vivo transscleral β-blocker transport to the vitreous at the end of 6 hours was determined in euthanatized, pigmented Brown Norway rats. The thicknesses of the sclera and SCRPE and the melanin content in choroid-RPE (CRPE) were measured to determine whether species differences in drug transport can be explained on this basis. RESULTS Solute lipophilicity inversely correlated with the SCRPE cumulative percentage of transport in all species (R(2) ≥ 0.80). The CRPE impeded the SCRPE transport of all β-blockers (51%-64% resistance in the rabbits; 84%-99.8% in the bovine and porcine eyes) more than the sclera, with the impedance increasing with lipophilicity. SCRPE transport followed the trend albino rabbit > pigmented rabbit > human > porcine > bovine, and a cross-species comparison showed good Spearman's rho correlation (R(2) ≥ 0.85). Bovine (R(2) = 0.84), porcine (R(2) = 0.84), and human (R(2) = 0.71) SCRPE transport was more predictive than that in the rabbit models (R(2) = 0.60-0.61) of transscleral solute transport to the vitreous in rats. The CRPE concentrations were higher in pigmented rabbits than in albino rabbits. The melanin content of the CRPE exhibited the trend albino rabbit ≪ pigmented rabbit < porcine ∼ bovine < rat. Normalization to scleral thickness abolished the species differences in scleral transport. Normalization to SCRPE thickness and melanin content significantly reduced species differences in SCRPE transport. CONCLUSIONS Owing to the presence of pigment and drug binding, choroid-RPE is the principal barrier to transscleral β-blocker transport, with the barrier being more significant for lipophilic β-blockers. Although different in magnitude between species, sclera/SCRPE transport can be correlated between species. Tissue thickness accounts for the species differences in scleral transport. Differences in tissue thickness and melanin content largely account for the species differences in SCRPE transport.","Kadam, Rajendra S; Cheruvu, Narayan P S; Edelhauser, Henry F; Kompella, Uday B",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.10-6233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21282583/,438

The mechanisms for the development of APCIS include vessel wall abnormalities (atherosclerosis, vasculitis, and calciphylaxis), embolic processes (infectious endocarditis, atrial myxoma, and cholesterol emboli), local thrombotic injuries (genetic or acquired thrombophilias and heparin- and warfarin-induced ischemia), dysproteinemias (cryoglobulinemia and cryofibrinogenemia), or venous limb gangrene. Here, we report 5 illustrative cases of APCIS with different pathogenetic mechanisms, thereby highlighting some clinical conditions that cause APCIS that may be of special interest for rheumatologists, such as antiphospholipid syndrome, primary and secondary vasculitis, and cryoproteinemias. Furthermore, we describe a large spectrum of other causes of APCIS beyond the scope of rheumatology. Because there are no validated guidelines for APCIS, we tentatively propose an initial diagnostic workup and a therapeutic approach based on full-dose anticoagulation and immunosuppressive therapy.","Santiago, Mittermayer B; Paz, Adriane",Journal of clinical rheumatology : practical reports on rheumatic & musculoskeletal diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/rhu.0000000000001609; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33315786/,438

MATERIALS AND METHODS An electronic search, supplemented by hand searching of the references, was conducted with no time or language restriction in October 2016 and updated in October 2017. The results were reviewed independently by the two authors. All randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies, and case series were included. The primary outcome measure was implant survival (months). RESULTS The search retrieved a combined total of 391 articles. Following screening, 17 articles were included. A total of 1,715 mini implants were assessed in 475 patients. Follow-up periods ranged from 6 to 84 months (mean: 28.24 months). There were 75 failures in total. The overall survival rate was 95.63%. The majority of patients received four implants to retain their prostheses. Most studies used a flapless surgical technique, but there were vast differences in loading protocols and retention methods. Formal meta-analysis was not conducted due to the heterogeneity between studies. CONCLUSION Based on the findings of this systematic review, mini dental implants exhibit excellent survival rates in the short to medium term. They appear to be a reasonable alternative treatment modality to retain mandibular complete overdentures from the available evidence.","Jawad, Sarra; Clarke, Peter T",The International journal of oral & maxillofacial implants,https://doi.org/10.11607/jomi.6991; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30883617/,438

Various longterm sequelae are expected and rehabilitation medicine is challenged to support physical and cognitive recovery. AIM We aimed to explore the dysfunctions and outcome of COVID-19 survivors after early post-acute rehabilitation. DESIGN Observational cohort study. METHODS This study evaluated the post-acute sequelae of patients hospitalized for SARS-Cov-2 infection and analyzed rehabilitative outcomes of a subgroup of patients included in the prospective observational multicenter CovILD study. RESULTS A total of 23 subjects discharged after severe to critical COVID-19 infection underwent an individualized, multi-professional rehabilitation. At the start of post-acute rehabilitation, impairment of pulmonary function (87%), symptoms related to postintensive care syndrome, and neuropsychological dysfunction (85%) were frequently found, whereas cardiac function appeared to be largely unaffected. Of interest, multidisciplinary rehabilitation resulted in a significant improvement in lung function, as reflected by an increase of forced vital capacity (p=0.007) and forced expiratory volume in one second (p=0.014), total lung capacity (p=0.003), and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (p=0.002). Accordingly, physical performance status significantly improved as reflected by a mean increase of six-minute walking distance by 176 (SD ± 137) meters. Contrarily, a considerable proportion of patients still had limited diffusion capacity (83%) or neurological symptoms including peripheral neuropathy at the end of rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS Individuals discharged after a severe course of COVID-19 frequently present with persisting physical and cognitive dysfunctions after hospital discharge. Those patients significantly benefit from multi-disciplinary inpatient rehabilitation.

A total of 864, day-old male broiler chicks (Cobb) were randomly assigned to six treatments (eight pens/treatment; 18 broilers/pen) in a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement, composed of three additives (control, monensin or blend), with or without Eimeria challenge. Intestinal contents was collected at 28 days of age for microbiota analysis by sequencing 16s rRNA in V3 and V4 regions using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Taxonomy was assigned through the SILVA database version 132, using the QIIME 2 software version 2019.1. No treatment effects (p > 0.05) were observed in the microbial richness at the family level estimated by Chao1 and the biodiversity assessed by Simpson's index, except for Shannon's index (p < 0.05). The intestinal microbiota was dominated by members of the order Clostridiales and Lactobacillales, followed by the families Ruminococcaceae, Bacteroidaceae, and Lactobacillaceae, regardless of treatment. When the controls were compared, in the challenged control group there was an increase in Erysipelotrichaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Streptococcaceae, and Peptostreptococcaceae, and a decrease in Ruminococcaceae. Similar results were found for a challenged group that received monensin, while the blend partially mitigated this variation. Therefore, the blend alleviated the impact of coccidiosis challenge on the microbiome of broilers compared to monensin.","Vieira, Alexandre Maciel; Soratto, Tatiany Aparecida Teixeira; Cardinal, Kátia Maria; Wagner, Glauber; Hauptli, Lucélia; Lima, André Luis Ferreira; Dahlke, Fabiano; Peres Netto, Diego; Moraes, Priscila de Oliveira; Ribeiro, Andréa Machado Leal",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764795/,438

However, relatively few data have been reported on physical therapy interventions during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for patients in intensive care units. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the feasibility and safety of physical therapy interventions, delivered as part of routine clinical care, for patients undergoing CRRT in an intensive care unit. METHODS Consecutive patients in the adult medical intensive care unit of one large tertiary care hospital who received physical therapy sessions while on CRRT were prospectively evaluated over 13 months. Physical therapy sessions were individualized on the basis of patients' physical impairments and activity tolerance, with patients' highest level of mobility recorded. Data on 15 different physiological abnormalities and potential safety events, including bleeding, dislodgement, or dysfunction of the CRRT catheter or circuit, were prospectively collected. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Eleven physical therapists delivered 268 rehabilitation sessions to 57 patients while they were receiving CRRT, with the following highest levels of mobility achieved during individual sessions: 78 (29%) bed exercises, 72 (27%) supine cycle ergometry, 80 (30%) sitting at edge of bed, 13 (5%) transfer to chair, and 25 (9%) standing or marching in place. No CRRT-specific safety events occurred (0%; 95% upper confidence interval, 6.3%). There were six non-CRRT-related potential safety events (2.2% of all physical therapy sessions; 95% confidence interval, 0.6-8.2%), all of which were transient changes in blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS In this prospective observational study at one adult medical intensive care unit, we found that provision of bedside physical therapy while patients underwent CRRT is feasible, and appears safe.","Toonstra, Amy L; Zanni, Jennifer M; Sperati, C John; Nelliot, Archana; Mantheiy, Earl; Skinner, Elizabeth H; Needham, Dale M",Annals of the American Thoracic Society,https://doi.org/10.1513/annalsats.201506-359oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26788890/,438

156424,Tunable Harmonic Flow Patterns in Microfluidic Systems through Simple Tube Oscillation.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Current guidelines recommend measurement of troponin in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. In AIS patients, troponin elevation is associated with increased mortality and worse outcome. However, uncertainty remains regarding the underlying pathophysiology of troponin elevation after stroke, particularly regarding diagnostic and therapeutic consequences. Troponin elevation may be caused by coronary artery disease (CAD) and more precisely acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Both have a high prevalence in stroke patients and contribute to poor outcome. Therefore, better diagnostic algorithms are needed to identify those AIS patients likely to have ACS or other manifestations of CAD. METHODS/DESIGN The primary goal of the ""PRediction of Acute coronary syndrome in acute Ischemic StrokE"" (PRAISE) study is to develop a diagnostic algorithm for prediction of ACS in AIS patients. The primary hypothesis will test whether dynamic high-sensitivity troponin levels determined by repeat measurements (i.e., ""rise or fall-pattern"") indicate presence of ACS when compared to stable (chronic) troponin elevation. PRAISE is a prospective, multicenter, observational trial with central reading and predefined endpoints guided by a steering committee. Clinical symptoms, troponin levels as well as findings on electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and coronary angiogram will be recorded and assessed by central academic core laboratories. Diagnosis of ACS will be made by an endpoint adjudication committee. Severe adverse events will be evaluated by a critical event committee. Safety will be judged by a data and safety monitoring board. Follow-up will be conducted at three and twelve months and will record new vascular events (i.e., stroke and myocardial infarction) as well as death, functional and cognitive status. According to sample size calculation, 251 patients have to be included. DISCUSSION PRAISE will prospectively determine the frequency of ACS and characterize cardiac and coronary pathologies in a large, multicenter cohort of AIS patients with troponin elevation. The findings will elucidate the origin of troponin elevation, shed light on its impact on necessary diagnostic procedures and provide data on the safety and diagnostic yield of coronary angiography early after stroke. Thereby, PRAISE will help to refine algorithms and develop guidelines for the cardiac workup in AIS.

Bariatric surgeons have several tools to assess this adversity. There have been debates as to which method is more superior and furthermore whether these methods should be routinely or selectively used. The aim of our study is to evaluate and compare whether methylene blue or upper gastrointestinal (UGI) study is more effective in detecting an anastomotic leak after RYGB. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between May 2013 and March 2014, 119 patients underwent laparoscopic RYGB. Linear staplers were used to create the gastrojejunostomy and the jejunojejunostomy. All patients underwent routine UGI studies and methylene blue challenges on postoperative day 1. A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was performed for all patients. RESULTS Of the 105 patients in this study there were 83 females (79.0%) and 22 males (21.0%). Mean age was 45.2±10.7 years (range, 21 to 66 y) and mean preoperative body mass index was 47.8±7.9 kg/m (range, 35.7 to 76.4 kg/m) at the time of procedure. Mean length of hospital stay was 3.2±6.0 days (range, 1 to 53 d).Four (3.8%) patients were found to have leaks postoperatively, but no leakage was detected in any of the initial routine UGI studies or methylene blue challenges. Both patient were diagnosed with clinical signs and underwent oversewing of the leak sites. CONCLUSIONS UGI studies and methylene blue challenges had no significant difference in detecting a postoperative leak. Furthermore, these tests may have limited utility and may warrant adjuncts to aid in leak detection.","Nelson, Lars; Moon, Rena C; Teixeira, Andre F; Jawad, Muhammad A","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0000000000000191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26271023/,438

Relocation of the implantation site to the upper abdomen could solve this problem. However, this would require an extended catheter. METHODS We developed an extended PD catheter based on a swan neck Missouri PD catheter with the help of two adaptors and a straight intraperitoneal extension segment. The extended catheter was assembled intraoperatively, and its length was adjusted individually to ensure correct positioning. After the operation, PD was commenced and handled as usual. RESULTS In the period from 2011 to 2021, we implanted 31 extended PD catheters in 29 patients (38% men) with end-stage renal failure and obesity. Median age was 53 (range 28-77) years and body mass index was 35.5 (range 26.4-46.9) kg/m2. The postoperative course was unremarkable except for seroma formation in one patient and dialysate leakage in another. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) was initiated in 20 and APD in 9 patients. The achieved median Kt/V was 2.10 (range 1.50-3.10). During the follow-up period lasting up to 51 months, there was one case of intraperitoneal catheter disconnection due to an avoidable handling error. The peritonitis rate was 1:40 months. The 1- and 2-year catheter survival was 92% and 67%, respectively, and paralleled patient survival. CONCLUSIONS When using a PD catheter with an intraperitoneal extension, PD catheter implantation can be relocated to the upper abdomen in patients with obesity, thus providing optimal position and easy surgical access.","Sayer, Michael; Thiel, Christian; Schenk, Martin; Königsrainer, Alfred; Heyne, Nils; Birkenfeld, Andreas L; Artunc, Ferruh; Thiel, Karolin",Journal of nephrology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40620-021-01077-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34236694/,438

While cancer survivors often experience complex issues after diagnosis, being an immigrant and having cancer pose additional challenges. OBJECTIVE This scoping review analyzed research about immigrant cancer survivors of Asian ethnicity in the United States and provided a structured method to understand an area of research and evidence. Aims focused on immigrants' experiences and how findings could tailor evidence-based interventions, programs, and resources. METHODS The PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus databases were searched to identify studies in English (2009-2018) targeting Asian immigrant cancer survivors in the United States. While 385 records were initially identified, 32 studies met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS Thematic analysis of charted study elements revealed 4 themes with subthemes: (1) survival patterns, (2) barriers, (3) culturally informed care, and (4) quality of life (QOL). While qualitative studies provided insight about the cancer experience from immigrants' perspectives, quantitative designs posed descriptions and associations among QOL concepts. CONCLUSIONS Study results illustrate the need for survival research that explores outcomes by Asian ethnic subgroups and tracks the influence of acculturation. Future research should test culturally informed interventions that minimize barriers and foster QOL across the cancer continuum. Culturally tailored instruments can expedite larger-scaled studies that allow generalization.

Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs) are a critical source of adipocytes. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play pivotal roles in cell fate determination and differentiation. The objective of the present study was to identify and investigate the function and regulatory mechanism of lncRNAs on adipogenic differentiation of hADSCs. METHODS We used lncRNA arrays to identify the prominent differentially expressed lncRNAs before and after hADSC adipogenic differentiation and verified their biological function through antisense oligonucleotide knockdown or lentivirus overexpression. The adipogenic differentiation of hADSCs was assessed by oil red O staining as well as the mRNA and protein levels of adipogenic marker genes through qRT-PCR and western blot. Bioinformatic tool LncPro and immunofluorescence was performed to uncover the interaction between lnc13728 and ZBED3. WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway was evaluated by western blot and immunofluorescence. RESULTS The lncRNA arrays showed that lnc13728 expression was significantly upregulated after hADSC adipogenic differentiation and was correlated positively with the expression of the adipogenesis-related genes in human adipose tissue. Lnc13728 knockdown in hADSCs suppressed the expression of the adipogenesis-related genes at both mRNA and protein level and weakened lipid droplet production. Accordingly, lnc13728 overexpression enhanced hADSC adipogenic differentiation. Beyond that, lnc13728 co-localized with ZBED3 in the cytoplasm and regulated its expression positively.

We describe the case of a 70-year-old woman who presented with worsening reto-orbital left-sided pain and a large cavernous aneurysm. The patient underwent endovascular treatment with PED, and there was difficulty delivering the device due to significant vascular tortuosity. This resulted in poor PED deployment as the proximal end failed to open. Increasingly aggressive strategies were attempted to open the device, which resulted in an iatrogenic carotid cavernous fistula. We were finally able to rescue the device and open its proximal end with balloon inflation after using a contralateral trans-anterior communicating artery approach and crossing the PED in a retrograde fashion. Excessive vascular tortuosity poses a genuine risk of PED malfunction and poor deployment. Although we were able to rescue the device and our patient had no permanent morbidity, difficult vascular anatomy rendered the procedure extremely complicated with dreaded complications.","Navarro, Ramon; Yoon, Jang; Dixon, Tanya; Miller, David A; Hanel, Ricardo A; Tawk, Rabih G",BMJ case reports,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2013-011009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24469910/,438
162379,The power of commemorative banknote design to support global and local events,2020,"The generation of reliable mAb of unique and desired specificities serves as a valuable technology to study protein expression and function. However, standard approaches to mAb generation usually involve large-scale protein purification and intensive screening. In this study, we describe an optimized high-throughput proof-of-principle method for the expanded generation, enrichment, and screening of mouse hybridomas secreting mAb specific for a protein of interest. Briefly, we demonstrate that small amounts of a biotinylated protein of interest can be used to generate tetramers for use as prime-boost immunogens, followed by selective enrichment of Ag-specific B cells by magnetic sorting using the same tetramers prior to hybridoma generation. This serves two purposes: 1) to effectively expand both low- and high-affinity B cells specific for the antigenic bait during immunization and 2) to minimize subsequent laborious hybridoma efforts by positive selection of Ag-specific, Ab-secreting cells prior to hybridoma fusion and validation screening. Finally, we employ a rapid and inexpensive screening technology, CELLISA, a high-throughput validation method that uses a chimeric Ag fused to the CD3ζ signaling domain expressed on enzyme-generating reporter cells; these reporters can detect specific mAb in hybridoma supernatants via plate-bound Ab-capture arrays, thereby easing screening. Using this strategy, we generated and characterized novel mouse mAb specific for a viral immunoevasin, the mouse CMV m12 protein, and suggest that these mAb may protect mice from CMV infection via passive immunity.","Aguilar, Oscar A; Tanaka, Miho; Balaji, Gautham R; Berry, Richard; Rossjohn, Jamie; Lanier, Lewis L; Carlyle, James R",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2000687; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32817368/,438

OBJECTIVE Our aim was to examine the uptake of clinical trials that have changed axillary management in breast cancer patients at MSH and non-MSH cancer centers. METHODS The National Cancer Database was used to identify patients eligible for the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 and Z1071 trials, and mastectomy patients fulfilling the European AMAROS trial. Uptake of trial results (omission of axillary lymph node dissection) was analyzed between patients treated at MSHs and non-MSHs and adjusted for patient, tumor, and facility factors. MSHs were defined as the top decile of hospitals according to the proportion of Black and Hispanic patients treated. RESULTS Of 7167 patients eligible for Z0011, 4546 for Z0171, and 9433 for AMAROS from 2015 to 2016, clinical trial uptake was seen in 1195 (74.6%) MSH and 4056 (72.9%) non-MSH patients (p = 0.173) for Z0011, 588 (41.9%) MSH and 1366 (43.5%) non-MSH patients for Z1071 (p = 0.302), and 272 (11.7%) MSH and 996 (14.0%) non-MSH patients (p = 0.005) for AMAROS. On adjusted analyses, MSH status was not significant for uptake of any of the three trials. Black race, socioeconomic status, and insurance were not associated with clinical trial uptake. CONCLUSION The uptake of three landmark clinical trials of axillary management in breast cancer was not different at MSH and non-MSH centers despite adjustment for social determinants of health. At the Commission on Cancer-accredited centers in this analysis, MSH status did not affect the uptake of evidence-based care.","Kantor, Olga; Chang, Cecilia; Yao, Katharine; Boughey, Judy; Roland, Christina; Francescatti, Amanda B; Blair, Sarah; Dickson Witmer, Diana; Hunt, Kelly K; Nelson, Heidi; Weiss, Anna; Oseni, Tawakalitu",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-09533-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423122/,438
162707,Data@Hand: Fostering Visual Exploration of Personal Data on Smartphones Leveraging Speech and Touch Interaction,2021-01-15,"BACKGROUND As model system, a solid-tumor patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model characterized by high peptide receptor expression and histological tissue homogeneity was used to study radiopeptide targeting. In this solid-tumor model, high tumor uptake of targeting peptides was expected. However, in vivo SPECT images showed substantial heterogeneous radioactivity accumulation despite homogenous receptor distribution in the tumor xenografts as assessed by in vitro autoradiography. We hypothesized that delivery of peptide to the tumor cells is dictated by adequate local tumor perfusion. To study this relationship, sequential SPECT/CT and MRI were performed to assess the role of vascular functionality in radiopeptide accumulation. METHODS High-resolution SPECT and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI were acquired in six mice bearing PC295 PDX tumors expressing the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) receptor. Two hours prior to SPECT imaging, animals received 25 MBq (111)In(DOTA-(βAla)2-JMV594) (25 pmol). Images were acquired using multipinhole SPECT/CT. Directly after SPECT imaging, MR images were acquired on a 7.0-T dedicated animal scanner. DCE-MR images were quantified using semi-quantitative and quantitative models. The DCE-MR and SPECT images were spatially aligned to compute the correlations between radioactivity and DCE-MRI-derived parameters over the tumor. RESULTS Whereas histology, in vitro autoradiography, and multiple-weighted MRI scans all showed homogenous tissue characteristics, both SPECT and DCE-MRI showed heterogeneous distribution patterns throughout the tumor. The average Spearman's correlation coefficient between SPECT and DCE-MRI ranged from 0.57 to 0.63 for the ""exchange-related"" DCE-MRI perfusion parameters. CONCLUSIONS A positive correlation was shown between exchange-related DCE-MRI perfusion parameters and the amount of radioactivity accumulated as measured by SPECT, demonstrating that vascular function was an important aspect of radiopeptide distribution in solid tumors. The combined use of SPECT and MRI added crucial information on the perfusion efficiency versus radiopeptide uptake in solid tumors and showed that functional tumor characteristics varied locally even when the tissue appeared homogenous on current standard assessment techniques.","Haeck, J C; Bol, K; de Ridder, C M A; Brunel, L; Fehrentz, J A; Martinez, J; van Weerden, W M; Bernsen, M R; de Jong, M; Veenland, J F",EJNMMI research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13550-016-0160-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26769345/,438

These measures hindered the rates of people's movements. These events have resulted in a decrease of Greenhouse Gas emissions and air pollutants, which have improved the environmental conditions and promoted the reduction of the causes of climate change in Egypt. The study depends on analyzing Remote sensing products “Sentinel-5P images” to monitor the change in the air pollutants of the Greater Cairo Region (GCR) before, during, and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. It also depends on using the methodology of the Carbon footprint, according to the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC), for determining the size of the GHGs emissions avoided, as a result of the curfew in Egypt during the period from January to August 2020 compared to the same in 2019. The study deduces that the partial curfew and social distance measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic reduced GHGs emissions in Egypt by about 15% and about 17% for NO2 emissions in GCR, 15.6%for SO2, and about 7.7% for the CO emissions, compared to the same in 2019.","Mohamed Madkour, Khaled",The Egyptian Journal of Remote Sensing and Space Science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrs.2021.07.003,438

US$27.95.",2020-08-23,"Motivation DNA metabarcoding is a commonly applied technique used to infer the species composition of environmental samples. These samples can comprise hundreds of organisms that can be closely or very distantly related in the taxonomic tree of life. DNA metabarcoding combines polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), whereby a short, homologous sequence of DNA is amplified and sequenced from all members of the community. Sequences are then taxonomically identified based on their match to a reference database. Ideally, each species of interest would have a unique DNA barcode. This short, variable sequence needs to be flanked by relatively conserved regions that can be used as primer binding sites. Appropriate PCR primer pairs would match to a broad evolutionary range of taxa, such that we only need a few to achieve high taxonomic coverage. At the same time however, the DNA barcodes between primer pairs should be different to allow us to distinguish between species to improve resolution. This poses an interesting optimization problem. More specifically: Given a set of references ℛ = {R1, R2, …, Rm}, the problem is to find a primer set P balancing both: high taxonomic coverage and high resolution. This goal can be captured by filtering for frequent primers and ranking by coverage or variation, i.e. the number of unique barcodes. Here we present the software PriSeT, an offline primer discovery tool that is capable of processing large libraries and is robust against mislabeled or low quality references. It tackles the computationally expensive steps with linear runtime filters and efficient encodings. Results We first evaluated PriSeT on references (mostly 18S rRNA genes) from 19 clades covering eukaryotic organisms that are typical for freshwater plankton samples. PriSeT recovered several published primer sets as well as additional, more chemically suitable primer sets. For these new sets, we compared frequency, taxon coverage, and amplicon variation with published primer sets. For 11 clades we found de novo primer pairs that cover more taxa than the published ones, and for six clades de novo primers resulted in greater sequence (i.e., DNA barcode) variation. We also applied PriSeT to 19 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and computed 114 new primer pairs with the additional constraint that the sequences have no co-occurrences in other taxa. These primer sets would be suitable for empirical testing.

In the present study, we combined variable and person-oriented approaches and examined relationships between resilience, parental burnout, and perfectionism during the lockdown. We first used structural equation modeling to assess the paths between variables. We then used latent profile analysis to examine different profiles of parents based on resilience, perfectionism, and symptoms of parental burnout. Finally, we examined how these profiles differ in terms of relevant background variables. The results showed that resilience predicted parental burnout negatively even after controlling for multidimensional perfectionism. Parents? age, children's age, children's special needs, and the increase in time spent with children due to lockdown contributed independently to burning out as a parent. Three profiles were found: a resilient profile, perfectionist profile, and burned-out profile. Resilient parents were likely to be men, older, and with less financial difficulties than parents in the other two profiles, and less likely to spend increased time with their children due to lockdown than the burned-out parents. Perfectionist parents, in turn, had older children than the burned-out parents did. These results suggest that resilience may help parents overcome burnout at times of crisis.","Sorkkila, Matilda Aunola Kaisa",The Family Journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/10664807211027307,438

Effects of surgical masks on droplet and aerosol dispersion under oxygen delivery modalities are not yet clarified. Objectives To visualize and quantify dispersion particles under various oxygen delivery modalities and examine the protective effect of surgical masks on particle dispersion. Methods Three and five healthy men were enrolled for video recording and quantification of particles, respectively. Various oxygen delivery modalities including high flow nasal cannula were used in this study. Particle dispersions during rest breathing, speaking, and coughing were recorded and automatically counted in each condition and were evaluated with or without surgical masks. Measurements and Main Results Coughing led to the maximum amount and distance of particle dispersion, regardless of modalities. Droplet dispersion was not visually increased by oxygen delivery modalities compared to breathing at room air. With surgical masks over the nasal cannula or high-flow nasal cannula, droplet dispersion was barely visible. Oxygen modalities did not increase the particle dispersion counts regardless of breathing pattens. Wearing surgical masks significantly decreased particle dispersion in all modalities while speaking and coughing, regardless of particle sizes, and reduction rates were approximately 95 and 80-90 % for larger (> 5 m) and smaller (> 0.5 m) particles, respectively.

Methods: We compared immune responses in ambulatory adults vaccinated with mRNA-1273 , BNT-162b2 or Ad26.COV2.S in Massachusetts, USA between February and May 2021. Control groups were pre-pandemic controls (n=1220) and individuals without (n=112) or with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=130) sampled in mid-2020. We measured total anti-spike IgG/M/A antibodies (Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-COV-2 S assay), anti-receptor-binding-domain (RBD) antibodies; neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus; and T-cell responses. Findings In individuals with prior infection, all vaccines were associated with higher antibody concentrations and neutralization than those in convalescent individuals, even after a single dose. In individuals without prior infection, a single dose of either mRNA vaccine yielded comparable concentrations and neutralization to convalescent unvaccinated individuals, and Ad26.COV2.S yielded lower antibody concentrations and neutralization titers. The second dose of either mRNA vaccine boosted responses. At a median of 24 days after vaccination, two of 21 (9.5%) Ad26.COV2.S recipients had a neutralization titer higher than pre-pandemic controls; repeat sampling at a median 66 days after vaccination found most (11/15 (73%) remained negative. Antibody concentrations and neutralization titers increased similarly after the first dose of either vaccine, and even further in recipients of a second dose of vaccine. T-cell responses were higher in mRNA1273 and BNT162b2 than Ad26.COV2.S recipients. Interpretation SARS-CoV-2 vaccines vary significantly in immunogenicity in individuals without prior infection.

Our PHC simulation models incorporate four types of patients seeking medical care: outpatients, inpatients, childbirth cases, and patients seeking antenatal care. A generic modelling approach was adopted to develop simulation models of PHC operations. This involved developing an archetype PHC simulation, which was then adapted to represent two other PHC configurations, differing in numbers of resources and types of services provided, encountered during PHC visits. A model representing a benchmark configuration conforming to government-mandated operational guidelines, with demand estimated from disease burden data and service times closer to international estimates (higher than observed), was also developed. Simulation outcomes for the three observed configurations indicate negligible patient waiting times and low resource utilisation values at observed patient demand estimates. However, simulation outcomes for the benchmark configuration indicated significantly higher resource utilisation. Simulation experiments to evaluate the effect of potential changes in operational patterns on reducing the utilisation of stressed resources for the benchmark case were performed. Our analysis also motivated the development of simple analytical approximations of the average utilisation of a server in a queueing system with characteristics similar to the PHC doctor/patient system.

Average make-up per session were as follows: 16% physicians, 26% Medical Officers, 4% Internal Medicine Residents, 32% nurses, 21% other. Sample output to test PDF Combine only Healthcare workers from Botswana were invited to participate in content preparation and presentation to their peers;3 of 8 presentations were by Botswana personnel. Average pre-session test score was 70% (range 40-89%);postsession score was 82% (range 55-97%). In post sessions surveys, average confidence in diagnosis and recognition across emergencies was 84% (range 71-100%);average confidence in management was 81% (range 57-100%). Conclusions: We describe the successful piloting of a case-based virtual training program in oncologic emergencies, which to our knowledge is the first of its kind. The program was adapted to the Botswana health care setting. Overall, confidence in diagnosis, recognition and management of oncologic emergencies appeared to increase after sessions. Plans are in place to expand the series to more sites within the country, most of which do not have dedicated oncology trained staff.","Li, S.; Qureshi, S.; Antony, R.; Wilson, K.; Moumakwa, R.; Lebelonyane, R.; Gaolathe, T.; Shah, M.; Popli, P.; Chandar, A.; Kaur, S.; Marlink, R.; Mayer, T.; Vuylsteke, P.; Ralefala, T.",Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention,https://doi.org/10.1158/1538-7755.asgcr21-84,438
164958,Validation in a Distance Learning Environment,2021,"Abstract Elliptical vibration cutting (EVC) is an advanced micromachining technology that has a wide range of applications in high-precision micro/nano manufacturing. This technology is primarily used in fabrication of micro/nano-scale functional surfaces, geometrical features, optical and holographic components that are cut in ferrous and difficult-to-cut tooling materials with high form accuracy and surface quality. The main objective of this study was to demonstrate the positive effect of EVC motions on cutting force reduction and stabilization. For this purpose, a series of cutting trials involving the fabrication of micro V-grooves by means of the ultraprecise single point cutting (USPC) were performed. To maintain a constant level of the cutting force, an axial multi-pass cutting strategy with constant cutting area was employed. The influence and advantages brought by EVC over the conventional ‘no-EVC’ USPC scenario were initially assessed by means of the theoretical considerations of the cutting force. Following that, experimental generation of V-grooves has demonstrated that the integration of EVC kinematics with USPC motions has the ability to reduce the ‘no-EVC’ cutting forces by more than 90%, to values around 0.1 N for the main axial component. The addition of EVC motions caused a minimal decrease in surface quality whose areal roughness increased from 14 nm in the ‘no-EVC’ case to 16 nm in the ‘with-EVC’ scenario. These observations are expected to open new opportunities in micromachining of micro/nano products, systems, sensors, functional surfaces, and lighting and holographic optics.","Farrus, Nikolai; Joao, Delfim; Milliken, Nicolas; Tutunea-Fatan, O.

165006,Mining Implicit Relevance Feedback from User Behavior for Web Question Answering,2020-06-13,"The lysosomal membrane protein NPC1 (Niemann-Pick type C1) and NPC2 (Niemann-Pick type C2) are main players of cholesterol control in lysosome and it is known that mutation on these proteins leads to cholesterol trafficking related disease, called Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) disease. The mutation R518W or R518Q on NPC1 is one of such disease-related mutations, causing reduced cholesterol transport by half, resulting in accumulation of cholesterol and lipids in late endosomal/lysosomal region of the cell. Even though there has been significant progress in understanding cholesterol transport by NPC1 in combination with NPC2, especially after the structural determination of full length NPC1 in 2016, many details such as interaction of full length NPC1 with NPC2, molecular motions responsible for cholesterol transport during and after this interaction, and structure and function relations of many mutations are still not well understood. We report the extensive molecular dynamics simulations to gain insight into the structure and motions of NPC1 lumenal domain for cholesterol transport and disease behind the mutation (R518W). It is found that the mutation induces structural shift of NTD (N-terminal domain), toward the loop region in MLD (middle lumenal domain), which is believed to play central role in interaction with NPC2 protein, such that the interaction with NPC2 protein might be less favorable compare to wild NPC1. Also, the simulation indicates the possible re-orientation of the NTD, aligning to form an internal tunnel, after receiving the cholesterol from NPC2 with wild NPC1 unlike the mutated one, a possible pose for further action in cholesterol trafficking. We believe the current study can provide better understanding on the cholesterol transport by NPC1, especially the role of NTD of NPC1, in combination with NPC2 interaction.

While there has been extensive focus on understanding the amino acid mutations in the Delta variant ‘s Spike protein, the mutational landscape of the rest of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome (25 proteins) remains poorly understood. To this end, we performed a systematic analysis of mutations in all the SARS-CoV-2 proteins from nearly 2 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 176 countries/territories. Six highly-prevalent missense mutations in the viral life cycle-associated Membrane (I82T), Nucleocapsid (R203M, D377Y), NS3 (S26L), and NS7a (V82A, T120I) proteins are almost exclusive to the Delta variant compared to other variants of concern (mean prevalence across genomes: Delta = 99.74%, Alpha = 0.06%, Beta = 0.09%, Gamma = 0.22%). Furthermore, we find that the Delta variant harbors a more diverse repertoire of mutations across countries compared to the previously dominant Alpha variant (cosine similarity: meanAlpha = 0.94, S.D.Alpha = 0.05; meanDelta = 0.86, S.D.Delta = 0.1; Cohen ‘s dAlpha-Delta = 1.17, p-value < 0.001). Overall, our study underscores the high diversity of the Delta variant between countries and identifies a list of targetable amino acid mutations in the Delta variant ‘s proteome for probing the mechanistic basis of pathogenic features such as high viral loads, high transmissibility, and reduced susceptibility against neutralization by vaccines.","Suratekar, Rohit; Ghosh, Pritha; Niesen, Michiel J.M.; Donadio, Gregory; Anand, Praveen; Soundararajan, Venky; Venkatakrishnan, A.J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.01.458647,438

AMEGO operates both as a Compton and pair telescope to achieve unprecedented sensitivity between 200 keV and $>$5 GeV. The instrument consists of four subsystems. A double-sided strip silicon Tracker gives a precise measure of the first Compton scatter interaction and tracks of pair-conversion products. A novel CdZnTe Low Energy Calorimeter with excellent position and energy resolution surrounds the bottom and sides of the Tracker to detect the Compton-scattered photons which enhances the polarization and narrow-line sensitivity. A thick CsI High Energy Calorimeter contains the high-energy Compton and pair events. The instrument is surrounded by a plastic anti-coincidence detector to veto the cosmic-ray background. We have performed detailed simulations to predict the telescope performance and are currently building a prototype instrument. The AMEGO prototype, known as ComPair, will be tested at the High Intensity Gamma-Ray Source in 2021, followed by a balloon flight in Fall of 2022.

However, there are still no effective drugs to treat lung injury and fibrosis. In this study, we report the generation of clinical-grade human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)-derived immunity- and matrix-regulatory cells (IMRCs) produced under good manufacturing practice (GMP) requirements, that can treat lung injury and fibrosis in vivo. We generate IMRCs by sequentially differentiating hESCs with serum-free reagents. IMRCs possess a unique gene expression profile distinct from umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs), such as higher levels of proliferative, immunomodulatory and anti-fibrotic genes. Moreover, intravenous delivery of IMRCs inhibits both pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in mouse models of lung injury, and significantly improves the survival rate of the recipient mice in a dose-dependent manner, likely through paracrine regulatory mechanisms. IMRCs are superior to both primary UCMSCs and FDA-approved pirfenidone, with an excellent efficacy and safety profile in mice and monkeys. In light of public health crises involving pneumonia, acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), our findings suggest that IMRCs are ready for clinical trials on lung disorders.","Wu, Jun; Song, Dingyun; Li, Zhongwen; Guo, Baojie; Xiao, Yani; Liu, Wenjing; Liang, Lingmin; Feng, Chunjing; Gao, Tingting; Chen, Yanxia; Li, Ying; Wang, Zai; Wen, Jianyan; Yang, Shengnan; Liu, Peipei; Wang, Lei; Wang, Yukai; Peng, Liang; Stacey, Glyn Nigel; Hu, Zheng; Feng, Guihai; Li, Wei; Huo, Yan; Jin, Ronghua; Shyh-Chang, Ng; Zhou, Qi; Wang, Liu; Hu, Baoyang; Dai, Huaping; Hao, Jie",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.042119,438

The peptide commonality has a relevant immunological potential as almost all of the shared sequences are present in experimentally validated SARS-CoV-2 spike gp-derived epitopes, thus supporting the possibility of cross-reactions between the viral gp and the thromboses-related human proteins. Moreover, many of the shared peptide sequences are also present in pathogens to which individuals have previously been exposed following natural infection or vaccinal routes, and of which the immune system has stored imprint. Such an immunological memory might rapidly trigger anamnestic secondary cross-reactive responses of extreme affinity and avidity, in this way explaining the thromboembolic adverse events that can associate with SARS-CoV-2 infection or active immunization.","Kanduc, D.",Global Medical Genetics,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1731068,438

This paper sheds light on this complex relationship by systematically studying the research on gender in the digital economy over the last 25 years. The methodology used is a systematic literature review (SLR) of scientific works and policy papers across different social sciences from 1995 to 2020 in the Google Scholars and Scopus databases. The SLR has resulted in the creation of three samples on which a quantitative and qualitative analysis was carried out to evaluate the volume of the research, trends across time, gender approaches and study topics. The general conclusions indicate that gender approaches to the digital economy stem from a wide range of academic disciplines, and also that there is a lack of theoretical consistency about gender analysis. First, the paper provides an overview of the volume of works and an analysis of some trends across time. Second, it identifies the three main gender approaches applied to the digital economy: (1) the ‘feminist theory of technology and ICT’ approach;(2) the ‘feminist political economy’ approach;(3) the ‘mainstream economic analysis and women’s participation and labour in the digital economy’ approach. Moreover, it distinguishes eight main gender analysis issues within these three approaches. Finally, the paper concludes by identifying future developments for a feminist political economy framework for the digital economy.","Grau-Sarabia, Mónica Fuster-Morell Mayo",Humanities & Social Sciences Communications,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-021-00875-x,438

While most vaccines are less efficacious in older adults, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underpin this. Autophagy, a major degradation pathway and one of the few processes known to prevent aging, is critical for the maintenance of immune memory in mice. Here, we show induction of autophagy is specifically induced in human vaccine-induced antigen-specific T cells in vivo. Reduced IFNγ secretion by vaccine-induced T cells in older vaccinees correlates with low autophagy. We demonstrate in human cohorts that levels of the endogenous autophagy-inducing metabolite spermidine, fall with age and supplementing it in vitro recovers autophagy and T cell function. Finally, our data show that endogenous spermidine maintains autophagy via the translation factor eIF5A and transcription factor TFEB. With these findings we have uncovered novel targets and biomarkers for the development of anti-aging drugs for human T cells, providing evidence for the use of spermidine in improving vaccine immunogenicity in the aged human population.","Alsaleh, Ghada; Panse, Isabel; Swadling, Leo; Zhang, Hanlin; Meyer, Alain; Lord, Janet; Barnes, Eleanor; Klenerman, Paul; Green, Christopher; Simon, Anna Katharina",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.01.127514,438

Demographics such as age, gender, race, and ethnicity and other factors such as household income, community type, geographic location, type of school, school environment, and number of books in home were collected. Frequency of access to school library materials was compared at T1, T2, and T3 by demographic and other factors. Results demonstrate that frequency of access to school library materials differed significantly between time points. Repeated-measures analysis of variance showed a significant difference between T1 and T2 and between T2 and T3 but not between T1 and T3. Significant interactions were found for age and frequency of access over time, with age group 6?10?years showing the most change. Significant differences were found for all three types of school environment, with face-to-face students showing less disruption in their access than online and hybrid students. Students? frequency of access to school library materials was negatively influenced by closures and limited access, with the expectation of a return to similar frequency of access on resumption of normal operations. Given the strong associations between access to school library resources and academic performance, these results suggest student learning may have suffered during these closures.","Soulen, Rita Reinsel Tedrow Lara",Journal of Librarianship and Information Science,https://doi.org/10.1177/09610006211037721,438

A non-probabilistic convenience sample was selected, composed of 5 subjects institutionalized in an institution of Idanha-a-Nova. For data collection, a characterization questionnaire was applied, and the participant was observed in the interaction with WhatsApp, during which the field notes and observation grid were registered and finally the Focus Group technique was used. It was concluded that the application and the equipment itself are not adapted to the institutionalized elderly belonging to this study, mainly due to the difficulty in accessing effectively, efficiently and satisfactorily. © 2021 AISTI.","Martins, A.; Vivas, I.; Andrade, D.; Gil, H.","16th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies, CISTI 2021",https://doi.org/10.23919/cisti52073.2021.9476260,438
169008,Guidelines for the Development of Immersive Virtual Reality Software for Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuropsychology: The Development of Virtual Reality Everyday Assessment Lab (VR-EAL),2021-01-20,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is now dominated by variant lineages; the resulting impact on disease severity remains unclear. Using a retrospective cohort study, we assessed the risk of hospitalization following infection with nine variants of concern or interest (VOC/VOI). Methods: Our study includes individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR in the Washington Disease Reporting System and with available viral genome data, from December 1, 2020 to July 30, 2021. The main analysis was restricted to cases with specimens collected through sentinel surveillance. Using a Cox proportional hazards model with mixed effects, we estimated hazard ratios (HR) for the risk of hospitalization following infection with a VOC/VOI, adjusting for age, sex, and vaccination status. Findings: Of the 27,814 cases, 23,170 (83.3%) were sequenced through sentinel surveillance, of which 726 (3.1%) were hospitalized due to COVID-19. Higher hospitalization risk was found for infections with Gamma (HR 3.17, 95% CI 2.15-4.67), Beta (HR: 2.97, 95% CI 1.65-5.35), Delta (HR: 2.30, 95% CI 1.69-3.15), and Alpha (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.26-1.99) compared to infections with an ancestral lineage. Following VOC infection, unvaccinated patients show a similar higher hospitalization risk, while vaccinated patients show no significant difference in risk, both when compared to unvaccinated, ancestral lineage cases. Interpretation: Infection with a VOC results in a higher hospitalization risk, with an active vaccination attenuating that risk. Our findings support promoting hospital preparedness, vaccination, and robust genomic surveillance.","Paredes, M. I.; Lunn, S.; Famulare, M.; Frisbie, L.

Rutin can be extracted from Tartary buckwheat as an active pharmaceutical ingredient. Nevertheless, its purification is mainly hindered by Kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (K3R) due to their similar molecular structures. This study intends to propose a simulated moving bed (SMB) chromatography process of rutin and K3R to achieve continuous production. True moving bed (TMB) and SMB models were established to numerically analyze and optimize this process. The system consists of a four-zone SMB with two columns in each zone. The effects of the switch interval, feed flowrate, desorbent flowrate, extract flowrate, raffinate flowrate, and recycle flowrate on the purity and yield of rutin and K3R were investigated and the optimized conditions were chosen as 5 min, 3.5, 40, 34, 9.5, and 24.5 L/min, respectively. Consequently, the purities of 99.64% and 99.25%, and the yields of 99.81% and 99.37% for rutin and K3R were obtained, respectively. The simulation results can provide a guidance for the future industrial application of SF-SMB to separate rutin and K3R.","Geng, Z. F.; Yang, Y. Z.; Yang, S. Y.; Zhou, J. Y.; Lyu, H.

169730,Privacy-preserving Decentralized Learning Framework for Healthcare System,2021,"Background: Immunisation of children is a highly cost-effective public health intervention and fosters health equity for the overall population. The WHO Immunisation Agenda 2030 highlights coverage and equity as one of the strategic priority goals to reach high equitable immunisation coverage at national levels and in all districts. We analysed full immunisation coverage among children aged 12-23 months in Kenya and estimated the inequities in full immunisation coverage associated with socioeconomic, geographic, maternal, child, and place of birth characteristics using data from the 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey. Methods: We analysed full immunisation coverage (1-dose BCG, 3-dose DTP-HepB-Hib, 3-dose polio, 1-dose measles, and 3-dose pneumococcal vaccines) of 3,943 children aged 12-23 months. We disaggregated mean coverage by socioeconomic (household wealth, religion, ethnicity), geographic (place of residence, province), maternal (maternal age at birth, maternal education, maternal marital status, maternal household head status), child (sex of child, birth order), and place of birth characteristics. We conducted bivariate and multivariate logistic regression to assess associations between full immunisation coverage and socioeconomic, geographic, maternal, child, and place of birth characteristics. Results: Immunisation coverage ranged from 82% [81-84] for the third dose of polio to 97.4% [96.7-98.2] for the first dose of DTP-HepB-Hib, while full immunisation coverage was 68% [66-71] in 2014. After controlling for other background characteristics, children of mothers with primary school education or higher have at least 54% higher odds of being fully immunised compared to children of mothers with no education. Children born in clinical settings have 41% higher odds of being fully immunised compared to children born in home settings. Children in the Coast, Western, Central, and Eastern regions had at least 74% higher odds of being fully immunised compared to children in the North Eastern region, while children in urban areas had 26% lower odds of full immunisation compared to children in rural areas. Children in the middle and richer wealth quintile households were 43-57% more likely to have full immunisation coverage compared to children in the poorest wealth quintile households. Children who were sixth born or higher had 37% lower odds of full immunisation compared to first-born children. Conclusions: The inequities in full immunisation adversely affect children of mothers with no education, born in home settings, in regions with limited health infrastructure, living in poorer households, and of higher birth order. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted routine and campaign immunisation services in 2020 and enhances the risk of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks, but it also presents an opportunity to tackle the identified inequities in vaccine uptake as immunisation services are restored to capacity.","Allan, S.; Adetifa, I.

However, these patients often have substantial co-morbidities and it is essential to understand whether cardiac abnormalities represent preexisting disease or are the consequence of COVID-19. Objective To determine the contribution and cardiac impact of co-morbidities in patients who have recovered from COVID-19. Methods In a prospective observational study, adult patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 were recruited from the Edinburgh Heart Centre between May and November 2020 and compared to healthy and co-morbidity-matched volunteers. Patients underwent gadolinium and manganeseenhanced magnetic resonance imaging and coronary computed tomography angiography. Results Twenty-three patients (54±11 years, 20 male) who recovered from COVID-19 were recruited. Half (n=11, 48%) required admission to the intensive care unit and a third (n=7, 31%) received non-invasive or invasive ventilation. Patients had a high prevalence of known cardiovascular disease (n=18, 78%), associated risk factors (n=11, 45%) and coronary artery disease (n=8, 35%). Compared with younger healthy volunteers (n=10), myocardial native T1 values (1202 ±25 versus 1162±27 ms, P=0.008, figure 1) and extracellular volume fraction (31.9±1.7 versus 29.8±0.5 %, P=0.001, figure 1) were higher with no differences in manganese uptake. Compared to co-morbidity-matched volunteers (n=20), there were no differences in native T1 values (1202±25 versus 1196±39 ms, P=0.61, figure 1), extracellular volume fraction (31.9±1.7 versus 31.0±0.5 %, P=0.11), presence of late gadolinium enhancement or manganese uptake. These findings remained irrespective of COVID-19 disease severity, presence of concomitant myocardial injury or coronary artery disease. Conclusions Patients who have recovered following hospitalization with COVID-19 have no evidence of a major excess in myocardial injury or dysfunction compared to co-morbiditymatched volunteers. The presence of co-morbidities likely explains many of the previously reported myocardial abnormalities.","Singh, T.; Joshi, S.; Spath, N.; Kershaw, L.; Baker, A.; Jordan, H.; Gulsin, G.; Williams, M.; Van Beek, E.; Arnold, J.; Scott, S.; Newby, D.; Dweck, M.; McCann, G.",Heart,https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2021-bcs.159,438
169813,The Internet of Bodies: A Systematic Survey on Propagation Characterization and Channel Modeling,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the imminent collapse of medical supply chains across global economies at an unprecedented scale. Essential supplies such as personnel protective equipment (PPE), ventilator components, and face shields have witnessed a continuous rise in demand and eventually boost the role of 3D printing. Over the months following the spread of the pandemic, 3D printed alternatives of many medical devices were made more accessible to hospitals, mostly by community-sourced design and fabrication. However, with the high volume usage of additive methodologies, several challenges associated with the design, manufacturing, and deployment of medical products have now been brought to further attention. In this work, a systematic evaluation of such challenges along with few possible solutions are presented. The pandemic and its effects on the industry are introduced in the context of disruptions caused across the supply chains. The role of additive manufacturing to counter these effects is presented with an introduction of the technology itself. Employing 3D printed products to address the shortages of healthcare equipment are mentioned and visualized. Thereafter, a central discussion is followed on the issues arising from the shift in production methodology of such medical devices—from conventional manufacturing to additive one. The problems are highlighted by discussing two important types of COVID-19 related 3D printed medical equipments—mechanical ventilators and PPEs. Thereafter, few possible solution methodologies are discussed as case studies of two particular instances of having such problems. Finally, a conclusion is drawn to solve the issues raised using similar solutions followed by future opportunities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Narayan, J.; Jhunjhunwala, S.; Dwivedy, S.

Hanks's disclosure increased perceptions of susceptibility to the virus. The celebrity exemplar also increased anxiety, which increased intentions to engage in preventive behavior. These findings suggest that the mere presence of celebrity might function as a cognitive and affective heuristic that guides risk-related assessment and decision making.","Cohen, E.

169904,Interaction aggregation operators to solve multi criteria decision making problem under pythagorean fuzzy soft environment,2021,"Dengue virus (DENV) is the cause of dengue / severe dengue and a virus of the Flaviviridae family, furthermore, dengue fever has rapidly spread in the world in recent decades. DENV is transmitted by female mosquitoes, mainly of the specie Aedes aegypti. The main method to control or prevent the transmission of DENV is to combat the mosquito vectors. Among these, one of important methods is to monitor the DENVs in the mosquito vectors. For the detection of DENV, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) were recommended, of which criterion standard is real-time RT-PCR with highly sensitive and specific. However, it takes long time as to judge the result per a reaction, besides the necessity of the treatment of RNA in advance, example of extraction, concentration and purification. It was our object in this time to develop the method of real-time RT-PCR detecting DENVs in shorter time, moreover without especial treatment of RNA from the mosquito in advance. Besides, this work was performed with combing the mobile real-time PCR device with the one-step RT-PCR reagent. Firstly, we succeeded in shortening the time of real-time RT-PCR for the detection of DENV per one reaction, so that the judgement needed less than 20 minutes if genomic RNA treated in advance. Moreover, each value on the real-PCR device was quantitatively correlated with the positive control RNA from 1.0 x 10 ^ 3 copies to 1.0 x 10 ^ 0 copies per reaction (This correlation coefficient R2 > 0.95). Additionally, it made sure that this method could be applied to each DENV serotype. Secondly, we established the basis of procedure for the real-time RT-PCR without the treatment in advance so-called ""direct"". As the result that the positive control RNA additive was utilized instead of the real DENV, spiked into the mosquito homogenized and sampled the supernatant without treatment, it was possible to detect on the real-time RT-PCR even if mosquitoes immediately after blood-feeding. For this reason, this method might be able to utilize in human sera, too. According to the results of this work, we could suggest the method is possible to detect DENV more quickly and more simply than heretofore. The Real-time ""direct"" RT-PCR, especially, could be performed with mobile real-time PCR PCR1100 device and one step RT-PCR reagent only. This method must help to detect some viruses other than DENV, too.","Muraoka, M.; Tanoi, Y.; Tada, T.; Tabata, A.; Mizukoshi, M.; Kawaguchi, O.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.04.20209635v1?rss=1,438

Associations between the two hypersensitivities have been found in some patients, but the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic. Using Her2-specific IgEs as models, we found additional binding to Ni-NTA without observable changes in binding to Her2 and that glutamine, together with the canonical Ni2+-binding histidine, could form Ni2+ binding signatures. This mechanism may underlie Type I hypersensitivity in the selection of anti-Ni2+ IgEs. This mechanism may also underlie Type IV hypersensitivity and the interaction of immunoglobulin proteins with other heavy metal ions. Our findings shed light to how Ni hypersensitivities can occur and how they can be avoided in therapeutics design, or even incorporated for biotechnological purification purposes.","Su, Chinh Tran-To; Lua, Wai-Heng; Poh, Jun-Jie; Ling, Wei-Li; Yeo, Joshua Yi; Gan, Samuel Ken-En",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.14.203539,438

Unclear conceptualizations, stakeholders’ influence on data collection and release, and a lack of experience creating public dashboards on health data are just a few of the issues plaguing CJ institutions surrounding releasing COVID-19 data. In this article, we detail issues that institutions in each arm of the CJ system face when releasing pandemic-related data.

Therefore, this situation has caused stress and burnout among the people and public health staff in Thailand. Objective: This study aimed to compare the stress and burnout levels among public health personnel during the lockdown and un-lockdown periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand. The secondary objective was to identify the factors associated with stress and burnout. Methods: This research was a cross-sectional survey study with online self-rated questionnaires. The sample size was 158 participants. Using convenience sampling, participants who worked in 12th health region, Southern Thailand took the questionnaire twice. The first time was during May-June 2020, which was the lockdown period from the COVID-19 outbreak in Thailand, and the participants completed the questionnaires again during July-August in the same year, which was the un-lockdown period. The non-parametric sign test, Spearman's correlation, and logistic regression analyses were performed for testing the hypotheses. Results: The average total scores for stress during the lockdown and un-lockdown periods were 4.139 +/- 3.534 and 3.398 +/- 3.344, respectively. Moreover, the average total scores for burnout during the lockdown and un-lockdown periods were 1.573 +/- 0.777 and 1.519 +/- 0.702, respectively. The stress scores during the lockdown period were significantly higher than those during the un-lockdown period (sign test, P = 0.02). The stress correlated with the burnout by using Spearman's correlation (P < 0.001). Binary logistic regression showed that the stress score (odds ratio 1.75;95% confidence interval 1.41-2.91) was a risk factor for burnout. Conclusion: During the outbreak, the stress and burnout were high;the health organizations should have interventions or activities to reduce stress and burnout.","Tunthanathip, S.; Laeheem, K.; Buayom, P.; Khwanthong, V.; Osotpromma, C.",Nursing and Midwifery Studies,https://doi.org/10.4103/nms.nms_92_20,438
170666,Review on the Security Threats of Internet of Things,2021-01-12,"The arrival of COVID-19 has ushered in a new era of distance learning. Since schools and universities have closed, learning has transferred to apps like Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and others. Almost all colleges have changed their curricula to reflect the current reality. Students' practical knowledge deteriorated as a result of the virtual form of learning, and they began attending lectures only for the purpose of attending them. With all of this, their grades and scores should ideally be declining, but the findings came as a shock. It was a fantastic turnaround. Many students outperformed their average score. This is due to the fact that there has never been a way to perform an organized evaluation without using unequal means in the online-mode of education. To address the existing problem, a system that can assist in analysing unfair tactics used by students is required. The employment of proctoring procedures is a big difficulty for the research community when it comes to online examinations. In this paper, we present how to create a complete multi-model system utilising computer vision to prevent the presence of humans throughout the examination. We propose a system that includes a variety of features that students may exploit throughout the test, such as eye gaze tracking, mouth open or close detection, object identification, and head posture estimate using facial landmarks and face detection. Our system can also transform the student's voice into a text format, which might be useful for keeping track of the words said by the student. This might aid the examiner in determining whether or not the student is speaking with someone close. In summary, this research reveals how to prevent cheating in online tests using semi-automated proctoring based on vision and audio capabilities and monitor multiple students at a time. © 2021 IEEE.","Maniar, S.; Sukhani, K.; Shah, K.; Dhage, S.","2021 International Conference on System, Computation, Automation and Networking, ICSCAN 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/icscan53069.2021.9526411,438

The rapid adaptation to the remote educational format has many professors experiencing issues with their students' interaction and participation. This change in classroom dynamics has forced educators to analyze if their virtual classrooms effectively educate students. An unsuccessful class is an enormous problem that can have a long-lasting impact on students as they finish their academic careers. By understanding students' perception of the virtual classes' operation, and their feelings regarding their potential success, professors can improve their sessions and the students' achievement. In this work, a survey was conducted to 126 students of four Peruvian private universities' engineering departments. The study aimed to measure the intention of continuing with online classes. We concluded that that variable is substantially explained by the usage satisfaction, the perceived usefulness, enjoyment, the effort expectancy, the social influence, trust, shared norm, and tie strength.","Machuca, J.; Chong, M.; Dorin, M.; Luna, A.; Yi, A.

An important part of cold chain sustainability is thermal packaging. Up to now one of the most popular thermal packaging materials is polystyrene - made from fossil raw material. Polystyrene has low thermal conductivity and density, but it breaks down into micro- and nano plastics when exposed to sunlight making it environmentally unsustainable. To determine which factors are important for cold chain regarding thermal packaging, 12 criteria were compared to determine their ranking. Further multi-criteria analysis was used to compare polystyrene to four alternative biodegradable thermal packaging options: mycelium-based, corn starch, non-woven wool, and non-woven feathers.

171452,A Virtual Reality Based Application for Children with ADHD: Design and Usability Evaluation,2021,"During COVID-19 the new normal became an increased reliance on remote connectivity, and that fact is far away to change any time soon. The increasing number of networked devices connected to the Internet is causing an exponential growth of botnets. Subsequently, the number of DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks registered around the world also increased, especially during the pandemic lockdown. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how botnets are formed and how bots propagate within networks. In particular, analytic modelling of the botnets epidemic process is an essential component for understanding DDoS attacks, and thus mitigate their impact. In this paper, we propose two analytic epidemic models;(i) the first one for enterprise Software Define Networks (SDN) based on the SEIRS (Susceptible - Exposed - Infected - Recovered) approach, while (ii) the second model is designed for service providers’SDN, and it is based on a novel extension of a SEIRS-SEIRS vector-borne approach. Both models illustrate how bots spread in different types of SDN networks. We found that bot infection behaves in a similar way to human epidemics, such as the novel COVID-19 outbreak. We present the calculation of the basic reproduction number Ro for both models and we test the system stability using the next generation matrix approach. We have validated the models using the final value theorem (FVT), with which we can determine the steady-state values that provide a better understanding of the propagation process.

BrainCheck (BC) is a CNT software available on iPhone, iPad, and computer browser, designed to fit the need for remote testing. Consistent measures across these varying platforms are necessary to ensure users have consistent cognitive assessments and results. We aimed to assess BC across all administration platforms and interactions to observe any differences in assessment performance. 75 participants were enrolled in the study and were divided into two groups: participants who took BC across multiple platforms and participants who took BC in both an administered and self-administered fashion. Here we found Stroop, Digit Symbol, and Trail A/B had significantly different performance across the platforms, while Flanker, Coordination, Matrix, Immediate and Delayed Recognitions did not. Also, we found that the test metrics did not show significant differences in performance between being administered and self-administering the test. We did observe quicker completion times during the second instance of the test when taken in quick succession (within a day apart, which would not be a typical clinical pattern) and despite this, composite scores did not change reflecting the resilience of BC to practice effects. In conclusion, our results demonstrate BC may be a robust, self-administered CNT solution with an appropriate adjustment for the platform used.","Ye, S.; Huang, B.; Sun, K.; Phi, H.; Ghomi, R.

Methods: Patient data were obtained by query of ICD-10 codes for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemia syndrome (HHS) between Mar. to Dec. 2020 and compared to pre-COVID rates in the corresponding time period in 2019. Results: There was 22% increase in number of hospitalizations with DKA/HHS in 2020 compared to 2019 (432 vs. 368). When computed as a proportion of total number of hospital admissions in 2019 compared to 2020 this difference increases to 40 percent (p <0.01), although total number of admissions in 2020 was 11% less than in 2019. The admissions with HHS doubled in 2020 compared to 2019. The number of DKA admissions increased by 14%. Increased number of hyperglycemic crisis observed mainly involved patients with T2DM. Mean weight was higher in COVID era (83.2 vs. 79.6 kg, p = 0.026). There was no statistically significant difference in the median HbA1c and mean length of stay between the two groups. Amongst patients with hyperglycemic crisis in 2020, 5.7% tested positive for COVID, 92% of whom had DKA. Conclusion: This study found an increased number of hospitalizations with hyperglycemic crisis in COVID pandemic in 2020.

Loneliness and social isolation are emerging public health challenges for aging populations. Methods. We followed N=11,305 US Health and Retirement Study (HRS) participants aged 50-95 from 2006-2014 to measure persistence of exposure to loneliness and social isolation. We tested associations of longitudinal loneliness and social-isolation phenotypes with disability, morbidity, mortality, and biological aging through 2018. Results. During follow-up, 18% of older adults met criteria for loneliness and, for 6%, symptoms persisted across two or more follow-up assessments. For social isolation, these fractions were 21% and 8%. HRS participants who experienced loneliness and social isolation were at increased risk for disease, disability, and mortality. Older adults experiencing persistent loneliness were at a 59% increased hazard of mortality compared to those who were never lonely. For social isolation, the increase was 28%. Effect-sizes were somewhat larger for counts of prevalent activity limitations and somewhat smaller for counts of prevalent chronic diseases. Covariate adjustment for socioeconomic and psychological risks attenuated but did not fully explain associations. Older adults who experienced loneliness and social isolation also exhibited physiological indications of advanced biological aging (Cohen's-d for persistent loneliness and social isolation=0.26 and 0.21, respectively). For loneliness, but not social isolation, persistence of symptoms was associated with increased risk. Conclusion. Deficits in social connectedness prevalent in a national sample of older adults in the US were associated with morbidity, disability, and mortality and with more advanced biological aging. Bolstering social connection to interrupt experiences of loneliness may promote healthy aging.","Crowe, C. L.; Domingue, B. W.; Hu, G.; Keyes, K. M.; Kwon, D.; Belsky, D.

Currently used machine-based monitoring of the breathing rate includes contact with the body, which may result in pain and discomfort. In this paper, a non-contact breathing monitoring technique is proposed by integrating RGB and thermal imaging systems with RGB-thermal image registration. This method provides a linear mapping for automated selection of the region of interest (ROI) followed by tracking to extract the breathing rate. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach and its robustness against motion, talking, varying breathing rate or rhythm, and high ambient temperature, this study was conducted in three phases. Validation of the proposed approach demonstrated a strong agreement with the reference method of breathing rate monitoring using a respiration belt. During normal breathing, the mean absolute error (MAE) reached 0.11 bpm (breaths per minute). While in more challenging conditions, defined by three phases, the MAE reached 1.46, 2.08, and 1.69 bpm, respectively. In short, the proposed method performance is a promising alternative to a contact-based method due to its strong agreement and might be useful in diverse applications such as sport studies, rehabilitation centres, quarantine centres, and in hospital or airport screening during the COVID 19 pandemic.","Maurya, Lalit Mahapatra Prasant Chawla Deepak",Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbe.2021.07.002,438

The multicohort, phase 2 CARTITUDE-2 study (NCT04133636) is evaluating cilta-cel safety and efficacy in various clinical settings for patients (pts) with MM and exploring suitability of outpatient administration. Here, we present initial results from Cohort A. Methods: Cohort A pts had progressive MM after 1-3 prior lines of therapy (LOT), including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), were lenalidomide refractory, and had no prior exposure to BCMA-targeting agents. A single cilta-cel infusion (target dose: 0.75×106 CAR+ viable T cells/kg) was given 5-7 days (d) after start of lymphodepletion (daily cyclophosphamide [300 mg/m2 ] and fludarabine [30 mg/m2 ] for 3 d). The primary objective was minimal residual disease (MRD) 10 negativity. Secondary outcomes were response rates (IMWG) and safety (per CTCAE;CRS and ICANS by ASTCT). Results: As of Feb 2021 data cutoff (median follow-up: 5.8 months [mo];range: 2.5-9.8 mos), 20 pts (65% male;median age 60 years [38-75]) received cilta-cel;1 pt was treated in an outpatient setting. Pts received a median of 2 prior LOT (1-3);12 pts received &lt; 3 prior lines and 8 received 3 prior LOT. All pts were exposed to PI, IMiD, and dexamethasone, 95% to alkylating agents, and 65% to daratumumab. The majority (95%) were refractory to the last LOT;40% were triple refractory. Overall response rate was 95% (95% CI: 75-100), 75% (95% CI: 51-91) achieved stringent CR/CR, and 85% (95% CI: 62-97) achieved ≥VGPR. Median time to first response was 1.0 mo (0.7-3.3);median time to best response was 1.9 mo (0.9-5.1). Median duration of response was not reached. All pts (n = 4) with MRD-evaluable samples at 10 at data cutoff were MRD-negative. Hematologic AEs ≥20% were neutropenia (95%;gr 3/4: 90%), thrombocytopenia (80%;gr 3/4: 35%), anemia (65%;gr 3/4: 40%), lymphopenia (60%;gr 3/4: 55%), and leukopenia (55%;all gr 3/4). CRS occurred in 85% of pts;10% were gr 3/4. Median time to CRS onset was 7 d (5-9), with a median duration of 3.5 d (2-11). CAR T-cell neurotoxicity occurred in 20% of pts (all gr 1/2). Three pts had ICANS (1 gr 1;2 gr 2);median time to onset was 8 d (7-11) and median duration was 2 d (1-2). One pt had gr 2 facial paralysis;time to onset was 29 d with a duration of 51 d. One death occurred due to COVID-19 (assessed as treatment (tx)-related by investigator). Safety profile was manageable in the pt treated in an outpatient setting. Conclusions: A single cilta-cel infusion at the recommended phase 2 dose led to early and deep responses with a manageable safety profile in pts with MM who had 1-3 prior LOT. Updated efficacy and safety findings will inform suitability of outpatient tx in this and other cohorts of CARTITUDE-2 as well as the CARTITUDE-4 study.","Agha, M. E.; Cohen, A.

However, cell-type annotation remains a main challenge as it largely relies on manual curation, which is cumbersome and less accurate. The increasing number of scRNA-seq data sets, as well as numerous published genetic studies, motivated us to build a comprehensive human cell type reference atlas. Here, we present deCS (decoding Cell type-Specificity), an automatic cell type annotation method based on a comprehensive collection of human cell type expression profiles or a list of marker genes. We applied deCS to single-cell data sets from various tissue types, and systematically evaluated the annotation accuracy under various conditions, including reference panels, sequencing depth and feature selection. Our results demonstrated that expanding the references is critical for improving annotation accuracy. Compared to the existing state-of-the-art annotation tools, deCS significantly reduced computation time while increased accuracy. deCS can be integrated into the standard scRNA-seq analytical pipeline to enhance cell type annotation. Finally, we demonstrated the broad utility of deCS to identify trait-cell type associations in 51 human complex traits, providing deeper insight into the cellular mechanisms of disease pathogenesis.","Pei, Guangsheng; Yan, Fangfang; Simon, Lukas M.; Dai, Yulin; Jia, Peilin; Zhao, Zhongming",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.19.460993,438

175982,"Investigation of the Distribution of the Daytime Employed Population of Yangon, Myanmar, with and without the Impact of Work from Home",2021,"Peer review of a research product varies widely depending on the publishers and platforms involved in the process. As scholarly publishing is disrupted by new innovations, peer review processes become more heterogeneous, placing an increasing burden on the researcher in understanding how they can communicate their scholarship. New ways to model such processes, and increase transparency, trust, and experimentation in scholarly publishing are needed. Many are emerging but can tend to focus on the needs of creators, and not those of readers, funders, and the whole scholarly publishing ecosystem. They may not place focus on representing editorial practices in ways that can be reliably aggregated, surfaced, and queried; are often limited to traditional peer review processes; and cannot capture the full range of editorial practices and events needed to accommodate alternative publication, review, and curation models. To support researchers in a world of experimentation in scholarly publishing, we propose a machine-readable, extensible, and discoverable framework for representing and surfacing review and editorial processes. Working with a Technical Committee composed of interested parties by employing a modified Delphi Method, we developed initial guiding principles and proposals towards an object-level editorial metadata framework compatible with a broad range of possible futures for scholarly publishing. We present the results of this process with a proposal and example use cases for DocMaps, a framework for representing object-level assertions.","McDowell, Gary S.; Polka, Jessica K.; Ross-Hellauer, Tony; Stein, Gabriel",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.13.452204,438

We described the prevalences of 58 health conditions and all reimbursed healthcare expenditure by health condition in France between 2012 and 2017. Methods and Findings All national health insurance general scheme beneficiaries (87% of the French population) with at least one reimbursed healthcare expenditure were included from the French national health database. We identified health conditions (diseases, episodes of care, chronic treatments) by algorithms using ICD-10 codes for long-term diseases or hospitalisations, medications or medical procedures. We reported crude and age and sex-standardized annual prevalences between 2012 and 2017, and total and mean (per patient) reimbursed expenditure attributed to each condition without double counting, and according to the type of expenditure. In 2017, in a population of 57.6 million people (54% of women, median age: 40 years), the most prevalent diseases were diabetes (standardized prevalence: 5.8%), chronic respiratory diseases (5.5%) and chronic coronary heart disease (2.9%). Diseases concentrating the highest expenditures were active cancers (10% of total expenditure of 140.1 billion euros), mental illness (10%; neurotic and mood disorders: 4%; psychotic disorders: 3%), and chronic cardiovascular diseases (8%). Between 2012 and 2017, the most marked increase in total expenditure concerned liver and pancreatic diseases (+9.3%), related to the increased drug expenditure in 2014. Conversely, the increase in the number of patients (and the prevalence) explained the majority of the increase of total expenditures for cardiovascular disease, diabetes and mental illness. Conclusions These results showed a regular increase of the prevalence and expenditure of certain chronic diseases, probably related to ageing of the population, and increased expenditures related to major therapeutic innovations. The Diseases and Healthcare Expenditure Mapping therefore enlightens decision-makers in charge of public health and health accounts.","Rachas, A.; Gastaldi-Menager, C.; Denis, P.; Lesuffleur, T.; Nicolas, M.; Pestel, L.; Mette, C.; Drouin, J.; Riviere, S.; Tajahmady, A.; Gissot, C.; Fagot-Campagna, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20198853v1?rss=1,438

176694,Enabling ideas for inclusive post-pandemic scenarios,2021,"In traditional systems, a single herbal formulation is often used in the treatment of diverse diseases, including some that are newly emergent and prevalent today. We provide here a multi-omics framework to probe the molecular basis of a multicomponent example herb, Cissampelos pareira L. (Cipa) used in the treatment of hormonal disorders and fever in Ayurveda. Cipa treated MCF7 cells exhibit downregulation of signatures of estrogen response. 38 constituent molecules in Cipa potentially bind ({triangleup}G< -7.5) with ER at the same site as estrogen. Cipa transcriptome signatures in the connectivity map exhibit positive scores with protein translation inhibitors and knockdown signatures of genes linked to the antiviral response. This includes the knockdown signature of RPL7, a coactivator of ESRI with a connectivity score > 99.92. This axis was found to be upregulated in the COVID-19 patient transcriptome. The antiviral activity through ESR1 modulation was validated in the DENV-2 infection model. We further observed 98% inhibition of SARs-COV-2 replication in infected Vero cell cultures with the whole extract. A few of its prominent pure constituents e.g pareirarine, cissamine, magnoflorine exhibited 40-80% inhibition. This study provides a novel framework for querying the molecular links of multicomponent Ayurveda formulations and explains their use in the treatment of disparate diseases. The novel biological targets identified here can become potential that could be applicable to more than one viral infection, such as the use of Cipa in dengue and COVID-19.","Haider, Madiha; Dholakia, Dhwani; Panwar, Aleksha; Garg, Parth; Anand, Vivek; Gheware, Atish Prabhakar; Singhal, Khushboo; Singh, Dayanidhi; Burse, Shaunak A; Enayathullah, M Ghalib; Parekh, Yash; Ram, Sushma; Kumari, Surekha; Kumar, Anmol; Ray, Arjun; Medigeshi, Guruprasad R; Bokara, Kiran Kumar; Sharma, Upendra; Prasher, Bhavana; Mukerji, Mitali",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.17.431579,438

A new dataset was collected during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We demonstrate two models: the Traditional Arabic Language (TAL) model and the Semantic Partitioning Arabic Language (SPAL) model to envisage the polarity of the collected tweets by invoking several, well-known classifiers. The extraction and allocation of numerous Arabic features, such as lexical features, writing style features, grammatical features, and emotional features, have been used to analyze and classify the collected tweets semantically. The partitioning concept was performed on the original dataset by utilizing the hidden semantic meaning between tweets in the SPAL model before invoking various classifiers. The experimentation reveals that the overall performance of the SPAL model competes over and better than the performance of the TAL model due to imposing the genuine idea of semantic partitioning on the collected dataset.","Fayyoumi, Ebaa Idwan Sahar",Data,https://doi.org/10.3390/data6060067,438

Not only the increase of heat exposure or natural hazard due to extreme weather, but the emergence of new species or the mutation of microorganism due to the changing ecology may harmful for human beings and another organism. This anthropological climate change phenomenon has negatively altered the most fundamental natural resources for living organism: air, water, and soil. Air has been polluted and warming due to human activities. The quantity of freshwater keeps on depleting, while the ground water recharge intervened with chemical and biological contamination. The sustainability of soil as the natural planting media is under threat due to land use conversion and soil quality degradation. Water acidification and temperature increase have been proved to change the salinity of seawater. Those climate change sensitive exposure may affect the immune system of the living things to survive. Those conditions grow the concern for the health status of humans, crops, farmed and wild animals. Understanding the mechanism whereby the climate change exposures affects the immunomodulation in living organisms may mitigate the negative health risks outcome. According to the circumstances, the 6th International Conference on Climate Change (ICCC) is focusing the discussion on climate change effects on immunomodulation as it is also the main topic of Sebelas Maret University of the 45th Dies Natalis’ anniversary address. Focusing and improving the climatic resilience strategies on immune system will be of considerably important to overcome the key climate-change sensitive pathways, as well as to support the achievements some global goals in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Changes included alternate day oral iron for all patients from booking, measurement of ferritin at booking and 28 weeks and a revised intravenous (IV) iron pathway. Baseline data were compared with re-audit data following pathway adoption to assess the impact on anaemia, ferritin levels and blood transfusion. Methods: Following local audit approval, anonymous data collection was performed using the electronic maternity database (Euroking), blood bank and electronic patient records. Haemoglobin (Hb) and ferritin results in the month of May (baseline data) and November (Nov, re-audit) were compared, in addition to red blood cell transfusion data. Booking (10–14 weeks’ gestation), 28 week (27–30 weeks’ gestation) and term bloods (37 weeks’ onwards) were collected. Categorical data were analysed using chi-squared test and continuous data compared using unpaired students T-test (Microsoft Excel). Results: Mean Hb results are summarised in the Table. Term Hb was recorded in [Formula presented]8% of women in both audits. The number of women with Hb [Formula presented]05g/L at term was 9.1% in May vs 7.1% in Nov ([Formula presented]= 0.37), whilst blood transfusion was administered in 3.4% vs 2.6% ([Formula presented]= 0.66). More than 90% of women had a booking ferritin in both audit cycles, with a mean (SD) of 42.4 (34.3) [Formula presented]/L in May vs 41.8 (31.4) [Formula presented]/L in Nov ([Formula presented]0.80). The mean (SD) ferritin at 28 weeks in May vs Nov was 14.4 (11.3) [Formula presented]/L vs 14.1 (7.4) [Formula presented]/L, with [Formula presented]6% of women with tests recorded in May but only 20% in Nov. [Formula presented] Discussion: Following implementation of a new anaemia pathway an increase the in mean Hb at term was observed, with a non-significant reduction in the proportion of women with anaemia (Hb[Formula presented]05 g/L). The baseline 28-week ferritin was low and despite routine oral iron prescription this did not increase in the Nov cohort, although there was a substantial reduction in the number of ferritin results available due to problems with community sampling. The pathway included changes to both oral and IV iron prescription. Additional qualitative and quantitative data is now required to understand pathway adherence (including patient compliance) and to inform the impact of individual interventions.","Baban, N.; Oliver, C.; James, K.

The advantages of this vaccine platform, such as rapid development and high efficacy, resulted in mRNA vaccines being the first approved vaccines against COVID-19. Looking forward to the development of future vaccines, how can we make RNA vaccines even better? While improvements in the stability of the formulation and cost of the vaccine are inevitable, one of the main challenges is lowering the dose of RNA in order to avoid side effects associated with high doses of RNA. One way to do this is by using self-amplifying RNA (saRNA), a type of mRNA that encodes a replicase that copies the original strand of RNA once it's in the cell. Here, we discuss the origins of saRNA, how it works in comparison to mRNA, current challenges in the field and the future of saRNA vaccines. © 2021 The Authors. Published by Portland Press Limited.

The aim of the study is to identify, through an empirical analysis performed on a sample of 1584 Central Europeans, whether the form of economic activity of the customer has an impact on the degree of acceptance of corporate marketing communication on social media. Based on a thorough statistical analysis, it can be stated that the perception of the use of e-marketing on social media is statistically significantly related to the economic activity of the customer. Social media marketing is perceived as rather positive by customers belonging to the category of students and entrepreneurs, while this form of promotion is evaluated neutrally by customers from the category of the unemployed and retirees. Negative acceptance is recorded only insignificantly across all involved groups. Based on the similarity of the behavior of customer groups, it is possible to more precisely target the online activity of organizations, thereby increasing the efficiency of spending business resources and eliminating market risks in terms of reputational issues.","Pollák, František Markovič Peter",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13073999,438

The interpretation consists in defining the probabilities of the game outcomes conditioned on the ratings of the players and should be based on the probabilistic rating-outcome model. Such a model is known in the binary games (win/loss), allowing us to interpret the rating results in terms of the win/loss probability. On the other hand, the model for the ternary outcomes (win/loss/draw) has not been yet shown even if the Elo algorithm has been used in ternary games from the very moment it was devised. Using the draw model proposed by Davidson in 1970, we derive a new Elo-Davidson algorithm, and show that the Elo algorithm is its particular instance. The parameters of the Elo-Davidson are then related to the frequency of draws which indicates that the Elo algorithm silently assumes games with 50% of draws. To remove this assumption, often unrealistic, the Elo-Davidson algorithm should be used as it improves the fit to the data. The behaviour of the algorithms is illustrated using the results from English Premier League.","Szczecinski, L.; Djebbi, A.",Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports,https://doi.org/10.1515/jqas-2019-0102,438

Instructors allocate important time to teach them and use different approaches including, attractive stories, tangible photos, physical plays, sites visit, awards and gifts. However, these modes of education become nowadays very hard to achieve as instructors are teaching from homes or offices through the Internet. They cannot have face-to-face meetings with children in classrooms. The major issue is how to find the necessary materials to teach them the new Arabic vocabularies and explain their meanings in an effective manner. Instructors can use textbooks, online libraries and search engines looking for Arabic educational resources while most of them are in English or in other western languages. The process is very long, time consuming and does not fill-in the gap. We propose to build a new educational large-scale multimedia Arabic corpus that provides thousands of vocabularies and chunks associated with best representative images. The instructors can use the bimodal corpus directly during the learning sessions to explain new Arabic words through images.

Objectives: The aim is to evaluate gender differences on the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the wellbeing, life habits, treatment, and healthcare access of European patients with RMDs. Methods: REUMAVID is an international collaboration led by the Health & Territory Research at the University of Seville, together with a multidisciplinary team including patient organisations and rheumatologists. This cross-sectional study consisting of an online survey gathering data from 1,800 patients with a diagnosis of 15 RMDs, recruited by patient organisations in Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom during the first phase of the pandemic (April-July 2020). Mann-Whitney and χ2 tests were used to analyse differences between gender regarding sociodemographic characteristics, life style, treatment, healthcare, and patient-reported outcomes. Results: 1,797 patients were included in this analysis. 80.2% were female and a mean age of 52.6 years. The most common diagnosis was inflammatory arthritis (81.7% male vs 73.8% female). There was a higher prevalence of fibromyalgia among females (20% vs 7.0% male). Overall, females reported worse self-perceived health (67.0% vs 51.4%, p<0.001), higher risk of anxiety (59.5% vs 48.1%, p<0.001), and depression (48.0% vs 37.2%, p<0.001). Females reported a greater increase in smoking (26.5% vs 17.5%, p=0.001), although they were less likely to drink alcohol (34.5% vs 25.4%, p=0.013), and also engaged less in physical activity (53.0% vs 60.3%, p=0.045). Overall, females were more likely to keep their scheduled rheumatology appointment (43.3% vs 34.1% of males (p=0.049;Table 1) with a higher proportion of females having their rheumatic treatment changed (17.0% vs 10.7%, p=0.005). Conclusion: The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and the containment measures have worsened self-perceived health status of patients with RMDs, affecting genders differently. Females reported worse psychological health and life habits such as increased smoking and reduced physical activity, while males increased their alcohol consumption and were less likely to attend their rheumatology appointments.","Garrido-Cumbrera, M.; Marzo-Ortega, H.; Christen, L.; Carmona, L.; Correa-Fernández, J.; Sanz-Gómez, S.; Plazuelo-Ramos, P.; Makri, S.; Mateus, E.; Mingolla, S.; Antonopoulou, K.; Grange, L.; Jacklin, C.; Webb, D.; Irwin, S.; Navarro-Compán, V.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.2417,438
180512,Electrotactile Feedback For Enhancing Contact Information in Virtual Reality,2021-01-30,"Worldwide, cancer screening faced significant disruption in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If this has led to changes in public attitudes towards screening and reduced intention to participate, there is a risk of long-term adverse impact on cancer outcomes. In this study, we examined previous participation and future intentions to take part in cervical and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening following the first national lockdown in the UK. Overall, 7543 adults were recruited to a cross-sectional online survey in August-September 2020. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify correlates of strong screening intentions among 2,319 participants eligible for cervical screening and 2,502 eligible for home-based CRC screening. Qualitative interviews were conducted with a sub-sample of 30 participants. Verbatim transcripts were analysed thematically. Of those eligible, 74% of survey participants intended to attend cervical screening and 84% intended to complete home-based CRC screening when next invited. Thirty percent and 19% of the cervical and CRC samples respectively said they were less likely to attend a cancer screening appointment now than before the pandemic. Previous non-participation was the strongest predictor of low intentions for cervical (aOR 26.31, 95% CI: 17.61-39.30) and CRC (aOR 67.68, 95% CI: 33.91-135.06) screening. Interview participants expressed concerns about visiting healthcare settings but were keen to participate when screening programmes resumed. Intentions to participate in future screening were high and strongly associated with previous engagement in both programmes. As screening services recover, it will be important to monitor participation and to ensure people feel safe to attend.","Wilson, R.; Quinn-Scoggins, H.; Moriarty, Y.; Hughes, J.; Goddard, M.; Cannings-John, R.; Whitelock, V.; Whitaker, K.

Humans are an important vector in the spread of this disease in mushroom farms. Three hand cleaning treatments (tap water, liquid soap and alcohol-based hand sanitisers (ABHSs)) were evaluated for their effectiveness at eliminating conidia of L. fungicola from a contaminated index finger. The hand sanitisers were highly efficacious in reducing the number of viable L. fungicola conidia on contaminated fingertips, although some variability was encountered. The tap water and liquid soap treatments had little effect. An in vitro test confirmed that the log10 reduction in viable conidia after 1 min exposure to the different treatments was ≤1 for tap water and soap and >4 for the ABHSs, which is similar to what is achieved in the medical care field for many bacteria and viruses. Thus, regular use of ABHSs by staff on mushroom farms may help to reduce the incidence of dry bubble disease. Their use could also be beneficial in other areas of intensive horticulture or agriculture where human hands are known to transmit plant pathogens to uninfected plants.","McGuinness, Brian Baqué Elodie",Agronomy,https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11081600,438

This system is used at multiple schools and universities in Iceland and Kenya, mostly for mathematics and statistics. Students earn SmileyCoin, a cryptocurrency, while studying. In Iceland the system has typically been used by students who use their own devices to solve homework assignments during the semester, accessing the Internet-based tutor-web at http://tutor-web.net. These students typically take final exams on paper at the end of the semester. In Kenya the system is a part of a plan to enhance mathematics education using educational technology, organised by the Smiley Charity with the African Maths Initiative. This has been done by donating servers running the tutor-web to schools and tablets to students. Typically these schools do not have Internet access so the cryptocurrency can not be used. Innovative redesign was needed during COVID-19 in spring, 2020, since universities in Iceland were not able to host in-house finals and schools in Kenya were closed so tablets could not be donated directly to students. Remote finals were held in Iceland but the implementation was largely in the hands of the instructors. In Kenya, community libraries remained open and became a place for students to come in to study. Innovations included using the tutor-web as a remote drilling system in place of final exams in a large undergraduate course in statistics and donating tablets to libraries in Kenya. These libraries all have access to the Internet and the students have therefore been given the option to purchase the tablet using their SmileyCoin. This paper describes these implementations and how this unintended experiment will likely affect the future development and use of the tutor-web in both countries.","Stefansson, Gunnar; Jonsdottir, Anna Helga",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.13658v1.pdf,438
181468,Blended Learning Tools and Practices: A Comprehensive Analysis,2021,"Respiratory viral infections pose a serious public health concern, from mild seasonal influenza to pandemics like those of SARS-CoV-2. Spatiotemporal dynamics of viral infection impact nearly all aspects of the progression of a viral infection, like the dependence of viral replication rates on the type of cell and pathogen, the strength of the immune response and localization of infection. Mathematical modeling is often used to describe respiratory viral infections and the immune response to them using ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. However, ODE models neglect spatially-resolved biophysical mechanisms like lesion shape and the details of viral transport, and so cannot model spatial effects of a viral infection and immune response. In this work, we develop a multiscale, multicellular spatiotemporal model of influenza infection and immune response by combining non-spatial ODE modeling and spatial, cell-based modeling. We employ cellularization, a recently developed method for generating spatial, cell-based, stochastic models from non-spatial ODE models, to generate much of our model from a calibrated ODE model that describes infection, death and recovery of susceptible cells and innate and adaptive responses during influenza infection, and develop models of cell migration and other mechanisms not explicitly described by the ODE model. We determine new model parameters to generate agreement between the spatial and original ODE models under certain conditions, where simulation replicas using our model serve as microconfigurations of the ODE model, and compare results between the models to investigate the nature of viral exposure and impact of heterogeneous infection on the time-evolution of the viral infection. We found that using spatially homogeneous initial exposure conditions consistently with those employed during calibration of the ODE model generates far less severe infection, and that local exposure to virus must be multiple orders of magnitude greater than a uniformly applied exposure to all available susceptible cells. This strongly suggests a prominent role of localization of exposure in influenza A infection. We propose that the particularities of the microenvironment to which a virus is introduced plays a dominant role in disease onset and progression, and that spatially resolved models like ours may be important to better understand and more reliably predict future health states based on susceptibility of potential lesion sites using spatially resolved patient data of the state of an infection. We can readily integrate the immune response components of our model into other modeling and simulation frameworks of viral infection dynamics that do detailed modeling of other mechanisms like viral internalization and intracellular viral replication dynamics, which are not explicitly represented in the ODE model. We can also combine our model with available experimental data and modeling of exposure scenarios and spatiotemporal aspects of mechanisms like mucociliary clearance that are only implicitly described by the ODE model, which would significantly improve the ability of our model to present spatially resolved predictions about the progression of influenza infection and immune response.","Sego, T.J.; Mochan, Ericka D.; Ermentrout, G.

However, when genomes have low variability in the early stages of a pandemic, the impact of technical and/or sequencing errors increases. We quantitatively assessed inter-laboratory differences in consensus genome assemblies of 72 matched SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens sequenced at different laboratories in Sydney, Australia. Raw sequence data were assembled using two different bioinformatics pipelines in parallel, and resulting consensus genomes were compared to detect laboratory-specific differences. Matched genome sequences were predominantly concordant, with a median pairwise identity of 99.997%. Identified differences were predominantly driven by ambiguous site content. Ignoring these produced differences in only 2.3% (5/216) of pairwise comparisons, each differing by a single nucleotide. Matched samples were assigned the same Pango lineage in 98.2% (212/216) of pairwise comparisons, and were mostly assigned to the same phylogenetic clade. However, epidemiological inference based only on single nucleotide variant distances may lead to significant differences in the number of defined clusters if variant allele frequency thresholds for consensus genome generation differ between laboratories. These results underscore the need for a unified, best-practices approach to bioinformatics between laboratories working on a common outbreak problem.","Foster, C. S.

In this paper, we analyze changes in banks' lending to Russian companies' in 2020. Our analysis shows that in 2020 the volume of new ruble credits increased relative to the level of the previous year. At the same time, there were changes in loans' structure, which are explained by the effect of government lending support programs that began in May-June 2020. This fact indicates that a large number of firms made use of these programs last year, partially or fully covering temporary liquidity-needs in the period of significant decrease in demand and revenue. Outside of the government support programs, the structure of market lending did not change significantly in 2020 compared to 2019. Banks prefer to lend to more productive companies: we see that the volume of credits to high productive firms was at the same level as in 2019. This means that efficient firms that should be drivers-of economic recovery did not have problems with access to credit in 2020.","Bessonova, E. V.; Popova, S. V.; Turdyeva, N. A.; Tsvetkova, A.

While they can be expressed recombinantly in cellular systems, in this paper we show that knob domains are also readily amenable to chemical synthesis, with a co-crystal structure of a chemically synthesised knob domain in complex with antigen showing structural equivalence to the biological product. For drug discovery, following immunisation of cattle, knob domain peptides can be synthesised directly from antibody sequence data, combining the power and diversity of the bovine immune repertoire with the ability to rapidly incorporate non-biological modifications. We demonstrate that, through rational design with non-natural amino acids, paratope diversity can be massively expanded, in this case improving the efficacy of an allosteric peptide. As a potential route to further improve stability, we also performed head-to-tail cyclisation, exploiting the unusual proximity of the N- and C-termini to synthesise functional, fully cyclic antibody fragments. Lastly, we highlight the stability of knob domains in plasma and, through pharmacokinetic studies, use palmitoylation as a route to extend the plasma half-life of knob domains in vivo. This study presents an antibody-derived medicinal chemistry platform, with protocols for solid-phase synthesis of knob domains; together with characterisation of their molecular structures, in vitro pharmacology and pharmacokinetics.","Macpherson, Alex; Birtley, James R.; Broadbridge, Robert J.; Brady, Kevin; Tang, Yalan; Joyce, Callum; Saunders, Kenneth; Bogle, Gregory; Horton, John; Kelm, Sebastian; Taylor, Richard D.; Franklin, Richard J.; Selby, Matthew D.; Laabei, Maisem; Wonfor, Toska; Hold, Adam; Vadysirisack, Douangsone; Shi, Jiye; van den Elsen, Jean; Lawson, Alastair D.G.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.16.448769,438

181807,"Assessing Children's First Impressions of ""wallBo""-A Robotic Handwashing Buddy",2021,"The COVID 19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the physical and emotional health of the population. In the case of specific populations, such as students and instructors, the change in the teaching-learning model has required both groups to adapt to online learning platforms and modify all academic activities in the context of implementing the emergency remote education model. The relevance of mental health has been continually neglected;however, due to the COVID-19 epidemiological outbreak, the impact of confinement on populations’ mental health has been incorporated into public discussion. In particular, the health emergency’s impact on health workers in the first line of care has been highlighted. The effect of mental health on the lockdown population and those encouraged to work from home, a group in which university professors and students are located, has been emphasized. To understand the changes faced by higher education instructors and students, derived from the implementation of the emergency remote teaching model in the context of the pandemic, we developed a study to investigate the experiences of this sector, with particular emphasis on the mental health stressors associated with their academic activities. We examined indicators related to anxiety, depression, motivation-demotivation, coping, and contextual and family conditions that could generate stress in the teaching-learning process during the emergency remote teaching model. We recruited a sample of 1,040 participants (380 instructors and 660 students) from more than 97 universities and 118 academic programs across the country. As a result, we have found that teachers have faced less difficulty with the teaching-learning model changes and how they deal with confinement. Similarly, this study has identified that women in general, both instructors and students, have more significant signs and symptoms related to mental health conditions, while men, both instructors, and students, resent the lack of socialization in the work and study centers environments. © Copyright © 2021 Zapata-Garibay, González-Fagoaga, Asadi-González, Martínez-Alvarado, Chavez-Baray, Plascencia-López and González-Fagoaga.","Zapata-Garibay, R.; González-Fagoaga, J.

We find that Deimos's inclination can be reliably generated by outward evolution of a martian satellite that is about 20 times more massive than Phobos through the 3:1 mean-motion resonance with Deimos at 3.3 Mars radii. This outward migration, in the opposite direction from tidal evolution within the synchronous radius, requires interaction with a past massive ring of Mars. Our results therefore strongly support the cyclic martian ring-satellite hypothesis of Hesselbrock and Minton (2017).

Access to clinical trials permits better treatment options and best clinical practice standards for patients with cancer. We present the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer clinical trial activity at the Cancer Clinical Trials Unit (CCTU) at the Mid-Western Cancer Centre, University Hospital Limerick (UHL). Over the last 4 years 28 clinical trials, both interventional and translational, have opened here, across a variety of primary disease sites, with 5 trials opened in 2017, 11 in 2018, 7 in 2019 but only 2 in the first 10 months of 2020 until 3 further trials were opened in December. Methods: CCTU records were reviewed to identify the number of patients screened and consented to participate in cancer clinical trials at UHL in 2020, which were compared directly with corresponding numbers for 2019. Results: In 2019, 17 clinical trials were open and recruiting at the CCTU, UHL. During 2020, 19 trials were recruiting although during the 1st surge of the COVID-19 pandemic recruitment was essentially suspended and CCTU staff were redeployed throughout the hospital. 1st Six months 2020 vs 2019 In the six months from January 2020 until the end of June 2020, 99 patients were screened and only 15 (15.2%) signed informed consent to participate in a cancer clinical trial. When these figures are directly compared with the first six months of 2019, there is a 33% reduction in patients screened for participation (147 vs 99) and a 60% reduction in patients consented (37 vs 15) to clinical trials. 12 Months 2020 vs 2019 In total during 2019, 376 patients were screened for inclusion to participate and 49 (13%) patients signed informed consent to participate in a clinical trial within CCTU at UHL. In 2020, 914 patients were screened for participation with 51 patients consented to participate (5.6%). The majority (45/51 (88%)) of patients consented to cancer clinical trials in 2020 at the CCTU, UHL were recruited to translational based studies and only 6 (12%) consented to interventional studies compared with 2019 when 30/49 (61%) consented to translational and 30/49 (39%) to interventional studies. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the percentage of patients consented to participation in a clinical trial reduced significantly, as compared to the previous year (5.6% vs 13%).

Prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among HCWs were 19.5%, 20.6%, 11.8%, respectively. Nonfrontline group showed a higher prevalence of depression (27% vs. 11%, p<0.001), anxiety (27% vs. 14%, p=0.001) and stress (15% vs. 8%, p=0.026). Being married, having children, living with family and higher income were associated with better psychological outcomes. Perceived lack of personal protective equipment, inadequate support from hospital authorities, greater discrimination, and lack of training to cope with the situation predicted poor mental health outcomes, and non-frontline HCWs were more likely to hold such perceptions. Conclusion Addressing factors leading to negative psychological outcomes in HCWs should be a key concern during this pandemic.","Baminiwatta, A.; De Silva, S.; Hapangama, A.; Basnayake, K.; Abayaweera, C.; Kulasinghe, D.; Kaushalya, D.; Williams, S.",Ceylon Medical Journal,https://doi.org/10.4038/cmj.v66i1.9351,438

This is supported from the anecdotal evidence received from students, which show that the inclusion and assessment of employability skills has provided them with an artifact that demonstrates the employability skills required for the continually changing future and workplace. For staff, the ability to assess and give feedback on the acquisition of employability skills makes it a more enjoyable experience.Design/methodology/approachDue to the short rollout period and pivot to online learning, there has not been an opportunity to undertake a comprehensive and formal data collection. However, anecdotal evidence has been collected from students and staff on the experience of the student-created video assignment in a completely online environment.FindingsThis paper establishes how a student video assessment contributes to students’ acquisition, development and enhancement of employability skills, such as communication and teamwork skills, that are central for preparing students for continually evolving future and thus the “new normal” brought forward by COVID-19.Practical implicationsThis paper enables the authors to share their experiences and provision of their resources so that other teaching academics are able to design their own assessment task that contributes to students’ acquisition, development and enhancement of employability skills.Originality/valueThe originality of this paper is the application of integrating employability skills in assessment practice and the associated rubric as way to build students’ employability skills in the post-COVID world.","Dyki, Matthew Singorahardjo Maggie Cotronei-Baird Valeria S.",Accounting Research Journal,https://doi.org/10.1108/arj-09-2020-0285,438

METHODS The in vitro susceptibility of the prototype of SARS associated coronavirus to a panel of nucleoside analogues and protease inhibitors currently licensed for clinical use was studied. Forty one patients with SARS followed for 3 weeks were treated with a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin. The clinical progress and virological outcomes were monitored and compared with 111 patients treated with ribavirin only who served as historical controls. RESULTS In vitro antiviral activity against SARS associated coronavirus was demonstrated for lopinavir and ribavirin at concentrations of 4 micro g/ml and 50 micro g/ml, respectively, only at 48 hours. The adverse clinical outcome (ARDS or death) was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the historical controls (2.4% v 28.8%, p<0.001) at day 21 after the onset of symptoms. The adverse outcome remained significantly lower in the treatment group than in the controls-both those diagnosed early (p<0.001) and those diagnosed later in the course of the epidemic (p = 0.002)-but there was no significant difference in adverse outcome rates between the two time periods (p = 0.548). No time related difference in outcome was observed in the control groups. A reduction in steroid usage and nosocomial infections was seen in patients initially treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, and these patients had a decreasing viral load and rising peripheral lymphocyte count. Multivariate analysis showed that age, hepatitis B carrier status, and lack of treatment with this antiviral combination were independent predictors of an adverse outcome. Lopinavir/ritonavir treatment was associated with a better outcome even when adjusted for baseline lactate dehydrogenase level. CONCLUSIONS The apparent favourable clinical response with lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin supports further randomised placebo controlled trials in patients with SARS.","Chu, C M; Cheng, V C C; Hung, I F N; Wong, M M L; Chan, K H; Chan, K S; Kao, R Y T; Poon, L L M; Wong, C L P; Guan, Y; Peiris, J S M; Yuen, K Y",Thorax,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14985565/,438

195787,Mechanics of Wound Closure: Emerging Tape-Based Wound Closure Technology vs. Traditional Methods.,2016,"Ten lines of transgenic mice secreting transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) neutralizing recombinant monoclonal antibodies (rMAbs) into the milk were generated. The rMAb light- and heavy-chain genes were assembled by fusing the genes encoding the variable modules of the murine MAb 6A.C3, which binds an interspecies conserved coronavirus epitope essential for virus infectivity, and a constant module from a porcine myeloma with the immunoglobulin A (IgA) isotype. The chimeric antibody led to dimer formation in the presence of J chain. The neutralization specific activity of the recombinant antibody produced in transiently or stably transformed cells was 50-fold higher than that of a monomeric rMAb with the IgG1 isotype and an identical binding site. This rMAb had titers of up to 10(4) by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and neutralized virus infectivity up to 10(4)-fold. Of 23 transgenic mice, 17 integrated both light and heavy chains, and at least 10 of them transmitted both genes to the progeny, leading to 100% of animals secreting functional TGEV neutralizing antibody during lactation. Selected mice produced milk with TGEV-specific antibody titers higher than 10(6) as determined by RIA, neutralized virus infectivity by 10(6)-fold, and produced up to 6 mg of antibody per ml. Antibody expression levels were transgene copy number independent and integration site dependent. Comicroinjection of the genomic beta-lactoglobulin gene with rMAb light- and heavy-chain genes led to the generation of transgenic mice carrying the three transgenes. The highest antibody titers were produced by transgenic mice that had integrated the antibody and beta-lactoglobulin genes, although the number of transgenic animals generated does not allow a definitive conclusion on the enhancing effect of beta-lactoglobulin cointegration. This approach may lead to the generation of transgenic animals providing lactogenic immunity to their progeny against enteric pathogens.","Sola, I; Castilla, J; Pintado, B; Sánchez-Morgado, J M; Whitelaw, C B; Clark, A J; Enjuanes, L",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9557658/,438

196162,Clinical perspectives of emerging pathogens in bleeding disorders.,2006,"Foamy viruses (FVs) are classified in the family Retroviridae, but recent data have shown that they are not conventional retroviruses. Notably, several characteristics of their particle replication strategies are more similar to those of hepatitis B virus (HBV) than those of typical retroviruses. Compared to conventional retroviruses, which require only Gag proteins for budding and release of virus-like particles (VLPs), both FV and HBV require Env proteins. In the case of HBV, Env (S protein) alone is sufficient to form subviral particles (SVPs). Because FVs also depend on Env for budding, we tested whether FV Env alone could produce SVPs. The Env proteins of FV and murine leukemia virus (MuLV) were both released into cell culture supernatants and migrated into isopycnic gradients; however, unlike MuLV Env, FV Env displayed characteristics of SVPs. FV Env particles were of greater density than those of MuLV (1.11 versus 1.07 g/ml, respectively), which strongly suggested that the released proteins of FV Env were particulate. When we examined FV SVPs by immunoelectron microscopy, we found particles that were consistent in morphology, size, and staining with gold beads, similar to FV VLPs and unlike the particle-like structures of MuLV Env, which were more consistent with vesicles produced from nonspecific membrane ""blebbing."" Taken together, our results demonstrated that FV Env alone is sufficient for particle budding. This finding is unique among retroviruses and further demonstrated the similarities between FV and HBV.","Shaw, Kit L; Lindemann, Dirk; Mulligan, Mark J; Goepfert, Paul A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12551971/,438

Human influenza is a subtype of influenza Avirus, from the family of Orthomyxoviridae. This strain is the cause of new influenza pandemic declared by the World Health Organization in June, 2009. This paper reports the first case occurred in Mexico: a 39-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and obesity grade II, which suffered atypical and aggressive pneumonia positive to coronavirus. Patient died 98 hours after her admission to the hospital unit. Due to the clinical presentation of the case, the doctors sent samples to the Instituto Nacional de Diagnóstico y Referencia Epidemiológica that sent an aliquot of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases of theAgency of Public Health in Canada, that reported positivity to influenza virus, and catalogued it as a new global strain called influenza A virus H1N1. The notice of 229E/NL63 coronavirus and its relationship to the recent outbreaks of avian influenza in humans and the clinical presentation of the case were the epidemiological circumstances that prevented the nation epidemiology system to establish global containment strategies to prevent the spread of this emerging infection.

We conducted studies to identify the etiologic agent of this outbreak. METHODS We received clinical specimens from patients in seven countries and tested them, using virus-isolation techniques, electron-microscopical and histologic studies, and molecular and serologic assays, in an attempt to identify a wide range of potential pathogens. RESULTS None of the previously described respiratory pathogens were consistently identified. However, a novel coronavirus was isolated from patients who met the case definition of SARS. Cytopathological features were noted in Vero E6 cells inoculated with a throat-swab specimen. Electron-microscopical examination revealed ultrastructural features characteristic of coronaviruses. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining revealed reactivity with group I coronavirus polyclonal antibodies. Consensus coronavirus primers designed to amplify a fragment of the polymerase gene by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to obtain a sequence that clearly identified the isolate as a unique coronavirus only distantly related to previously sequenced coronaviruses. With specific diagnostic RT-PCR primers we identified several identical nucleotide sequences in 12 patients from several locations, a finding consistent with a point-source outbreak. Indirect fluorescence antibody tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays made with the new isolate have been used to demonstrate a virus-specific serologic response. This virus may never before have circulated in the U.S. population. CONCLUSIONS A novel coronavirus is associated with this outbreak, and the evidence indicates that this virus has an etiologic role in SARS.

In addition to documented occupational hazards, exposure to smoking remains a major concern. This article reviews the prevalence of smoking among nurses working in the United States and discusses their reasons for smoking. Researchers conducted a state-of-the-art review on the effects of cigarette smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) on the immune system. Smoking prevalence among nurses working in the United States ranged from 796-12%, and high work stress, poor work environment, shift work, and peer influence were suspected major risk factors influencing smoking behavior. A review of the effects of smoking on immunity revealed that both active smoking and exposure to SHS negatively affects immune function. When rehabilitation nurses stop smoking their health improves and nonsmokers are exposed to less SHS. Rehabilitation nurses are encouraged to share knowledge of the immunological benefits of smoking cessation with patients to facilitate nurse-led rehabilitation programs.","Nakata, Akinori; Swanson, Naomi G; Caruso, Claire C",Rehabilitation nursing : the official journal of the Association of Rehabilitation Nurses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20836485/,438

However, there are no studies examining the impact of more rapid and sensitive diagnosis by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in this population. We performed a prospective study to assess the impact of real time PCR diagnosis as well as protective isolation for community-acquired respiratory virus infections in pediatric patients undergoing hemopoietic stem cell transplantation. METHODS During a 2-year period, 39 pediatric patients undergoing hemopoietic stem cell transplantation were analyzed for presence of respiratory viruses. Samples were taken at regular intervals and analyzed by culture and newly developed real time PCR methods. All patients were cared for in protective isolation. RESULTS Respiratory symptoms were observed in 10 of the 39 cases (26%) and a virus was identified in 8 and 6 of these cases by PCR and culture, respectively. The PCR detected the respiratory infection a median of 8 days before culture. However, the morbidity of the respiratory infections was generally mild, and no mortality was observed. Additionally all infections were observed pretransplant or after discharge; no nosocomial infections were observed. CONCLUSIONS The real time PCR assay is more rapid and sensitive than culture and could be used to screen patients before transplant or as respiratory symptoms present for timely diagnosis.","Bredius, Robbert G M; Templeton, Kate E; Scheltinga, Sitha A; Claas, Eric C J; Kroes, Aloys C M; Vossen, Jaak M",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15194832/,438

Since we observed similarities between COVID-19 and interstitial lung disease in connective tissue disease (CTD-ILD), we investigated features of autoimmunity in SARS-CoV-2-associated respiratory failure. Methods: We prospectively enrolled 22 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 patients with non-COVID-19-associated pneumonia. Full laboratory testing was performed including autoantibody (AAB; ANA/ENA) screening using indirect immunofluorescence and immunoblot. Fifteen COVID-19 patients underwent high-resolution computed tomography. Transbronchial biopsies/autopsy tissue samples for histopathology and ultrastructural analyses were obtained from 4/3 cases, respectively. Results: Thirteen (59.1%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and five patients (22.7%) died from the disease. ANA titers &#8805;1:320 and/or positive ENA immunoblots were detected in 11/13 (84.6%) COVID-19 patients with ARDS, in 1/9 (11.1%) COVID-19 patients without ARDS (p = 0.002) and in 4/10 (40%) patients with non-COVID-19-associated pneumonias (p = 0.039). Detection of AABs was significantly associated with a need for intensive care treatment (83.3 vs. 10%; p = 0.002) and occurrence of severe complications (75 vs. 20%, p = 0.03). Radiological and histopathological findings were highly heterogeneous including patterns reminiscent of exacerbating CTD-ILD, while ultrastructural analyses revealed interstitial thickening, fibroblast activation, and deposition of collagen fibrils. Conclusions: We are the first to report overlapping clinical, serological, and imaging features between severe COVID-19 and acute exacerbation of CTD-ILD. Our findings indicate that autoimmune mechanisms determine both clinical course and long-term sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the presence of autoantibodies might predict adverse clinical course in COVID-19 patients.","Gagiannis, Daniel; Steinestel, Julie; Hackenbroch, Carsten; Schreiner, Benno; Hannemann, Michael; Bloch, Wilhelm; Umathum, Vincent G; Gebauer, Niklas; Rother, Conn; Stahl, Marcel; Witte, Hanno M; Steinestel, Konrad",Front Immunol,,438

The morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 are elevated in AD due to multiple pathological changes in AD patients such as the excessive expression of viral receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and pro-inflammatory molecules, various AD complications including diabetes, lifestyle alterations in AD, and drug-drug interactions. Meanwhile, COVID-19 has also been reported to cause various neurologic symptoms including cognitive impairment that may ultimately result in AD, probably through the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system, COVID-19-induced inflammation, long-term hospitalization and delirium, and post-COVID-19 syndrome. In addition, the COVID-19 crisis also worsens behavioral symptoms in uninfected AD patients and poses new challenges for AD prevention. In this review, we first introduce the symptoms and pathogenesis of COVID-19 and AD. Next, we provide a comprehensive discussion on the aggravating effects of AD on COVID-19 and the underlying mechanisms from molecular to social levels. We also highlight the influence of COVID-19 on cognitive function, and propose possible routes of viral invasion into the brain and potential mechanisms underlying the COVID-19-induced cognitive impairment. Last, we summarize the negative impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on uninfected AD patients and dementia prevention.","Xia, Xiaohuan; Wang, Yi; Zheng, Jialin",Transl Neurodegener,,438

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 24 patients and 27 healthy subjects were included. The patients underwent neuropsychological tests and took twice resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) (before and after HD). Healthy group had one rs-fMRI. The zALFF based on rs-fMRI was calculated. Paired t and independent t test was applied to compare zALFF among groups. The associations between zALFF and duration of HD, ultrafiltration volume, and neuropsychological tests was calculated by partial correlation. RESULTS: Compared to healthy group, patients before HD showed significant worse performances on digit symbol test (DST) and serial dotting test (SDT). Patients after HD performed DST better than before HD. The patients after HD showed higher zALFF in left putamen than before HD. Multiple regions of both HD groups showed significant lower zALFF than healthy group. The zALFF of left putamen of patients after HD was significant negative correlated with the ultrafiltration volume (Râ¯= -0.679). The zALFF in patients before HD exhibited significantly positive or negative correlations with DST and SDT in multiple regions.

209077,Optimizing Hyperparameters in CNNs using Bilevel Programming in Time Series Data,2021-01-19,"This article aims to present how the advanced solutions of artificial intelligence and precision medicine work together to refine medical management. Multi-omics seems the most suitable approach for biological analysis of data on precision medicine and artificial intelligence. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar databases to collect pertinent articles appearing up to 5 March 2021. Genetics, oncology, radiology, and the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic were chosen as representative fields addressing the cross-compliance of artificial intelligence (AI) and precision medicine based on the highest number of articles, topicality, and interconnectedness of the issue. Overall, we identified and perused 1572 articles. AI is a breakthrough that takes part in shaping the Fourth Industrial Revolution in medicine and health care, changing the long-time accepted diagnostic and treatment regimens and approaches. AI-based link prediction models may be outstandingly helpful in the literature search for drug repurposing or finding new therapeutical modalities in rapidly erupting wide-scale diseases such as the recent COVID-19.","Lorkowski, Jacek; Kolaszynska, Oliwia; Pokorski, Mieczyslaw",Adv. exp. med. biol,,438

Our aim was to use the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as a positive control to assess the ability to quantify behavioral changes in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) from smartphone data. METHODS: Eight participants used the Beiwe smartphone application, which passively measured their location during the COVID-19 outbreak. We used an interrupted time series to quantify the effect of the US state of emergency declaration on daily home time and daily distance traveled. RESULTS: After the state of emergency declaration, median daily home time increased from 19.4 (interquartile range [IQR], 15.4-22.0) hours to 23.7 (IQR, 22.2-24.0) hours and median distance traveled decreased from 42 (IQR, 13-83) km to 3.7 (IQR, 1.5-10.3) km. The participant with the lowest functional ability changed behavior earlier. This participant stayed at home more and traveled less than the participant with highest functional ability, both before and after the state of emergency. DISCUSSION: We provide evidence that smartphone-based digital phenotyping can quantify the behavior of people with ALS. Although participants spent large amounts of time at home at baseline, the COVID-19 state of emergency declaration reduced their mobility further. Given participants' high level of daily home time, it is possible that their exposure to COVID-19 could be less than that of the general population.","Beukenhorst, Anna L; Collins, Ella; Burke, Katherine M; Rahman, Syed Minhajur; Clapp, Margaret; Konanki, Sai Charan; Paganoni, Sabrina; Miller, Timothy M; Chan, James; Onnela, Jukka-Pekka; Berry, James D",Muscle nerve,,438

Here, we describe a far-red light (FRL)-activated split-Cas9 (FAST) system that can robustly induce gene editing in both mammalian cells and mice. Through light-emitting diode-based FRL illumination, the FAST system can efficiently edit genes, including nonhomologous end joining and homology-directed repair, for multiple loci in human cells. Further, we show that FAST readily achieves FRL-induced editing of internal organs in tdTomato reporter mice. Finally, FAST was demonstrated to achieve FRL-triggered editing of the PLK1 oncogene in a mouse xenograft tumor model. Beyond extending the spectrum of light energies in optogenetic toolbox for CRISPR-Cas9 technologies, this study demonstrates how FAST system can be deployed for programmable deep tissue gene editing in both biological and biomedical contexts toward high precision and spatial specificity.","Yu, Yuanhuan; Wu, Xin; Guan, Ningzi; Shao, Jiawei; Li, Huiying; Chen, Yuxuan; Ping, Yuan; Li, Dali; Ye, Haifeng",Sci.

METHODS: Between 18 January 2020 and 20 May 2020, 110 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 108 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients were retrospectively recruited from three hospitals based on the inclusion criteria. Manual segmentation of pneumonia lesions on CT scans was performed by four radiologists. The latest version of Pyradiomics was used for feature extraction. Four classifiers (linear classifier, k-nearest neighbour, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator [LASSO], and random forest) were used to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 positive and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. Comparison of the performance of the classifiers and radiologists was evaluated by ROC curve and Kappa score. RESULTS: We manually segmented 16,053 CT slices, comprising 32,625 pneumonia lesions, from the CT scans of all patients. Using Pyradiomics, 120 radiomic features were extracted from each image. The key radiomic features screened by different classifiers varied and lead to significant differences in classification accuracy. The LASSO achieved the best performance (sensitivity: 72.2%, specificity: 75.1%, and AUC: 0.81) on the external validation dataset and attained excellent agreement (Kappa score: 0.89) with radiologists (average sensitivity: 75.6%, specificity: 78.2%, and AUC: 0.81). All classifiers indicated that ""Original_Firstorder_RootMeanSquared"" and ""Original_Firstorder_Uniformity"" were significant features for this task. CONCLUSIONS: We identified radiomic features that were significantly associated with the classification of COVID-19 pneumonia using multiple classifiers. The quantifiable interpretation of the differences in features between the two groups extends our understanding of CT imaging characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Wang, Lu; Kelly, Brendan; Lee, Edward H; Wang, Hongmei; Zheng, Jimmy; Zhang, Wei; Halabi, Safwan; Liu, Jining; Tian, Yulong; Han, Baoqin; Huang, Chuanbin; Yeom, Kristen W; Deng, Kexue; Song, Jiangdian",Eur J Radiol,,438

214213,A degrowth perspective on the coronavirus crisis,2020,"BACKGROUND: The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is creating unprecedented and unchartered demands on critical care units to meet patient needs and adapt the delivery of health services. Critical care nurses play a pivotal role in developing models of care that are effective, flexible, and safe. OBJECTIVES: We report on the accelerated development of a critical care nursing surge model responsive to escalating needs for intensive care capacity. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory prospective observational cohort study that included (i) a self-assessment and survey of learning needs of noncritical care nurses identified as candidate groups for redeployment in the intensive care unit and (ii) a pilot implementation of a team nursing model evaluated by individual questionnaires and the conduct of focus groups. We used descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis to analyse the exploratory findings. RESULTS: We surveyed 147 noncritical care nurses; 99 (67.3%) self-assessed at the lowest level of critical care competency, whereas 33 (24.3%) reported feeling able to help care for a critically ill patient under the direction of a critical care nurse. Identified learning needs included appropriate use of personal protective equipment in the intensive care unit (n = 123, 83.7%), use of specialised equipment (n = 103, 85.1%), basic mechanical ventilation, and vasoactive medication. We completed 11 team nursing pilot assignments with dyads of critical care and noncritical care nurses categorised in tiers of competencies. Nurses reported high levels of perceived support and provision of safe care; multiple recommendations were identified to improve the model of care delivery and communication. CONCLUSIONS: The complexity, acuity, and unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic is placing new demands on critical care nurses to modify existing processes for care delivery while ensuring excellent outcomes and professional satisfaction. The study findings provide a road map to support nursing engagement in meeting patient needs.","Lauck, Sandra B; Bains, Vininder K; Nordby, Dione; Iacoe, Emma; Forman, Jacqueline; Polderman, Jopie; Farina, Lena",Aust. crit. care,,438

Methods: Three methods were used to assess changes in responses to COVID-19. First, website visits and call centre traffic were compared across two time periods: the “comparison period” (1 to 28 September 2019), and during the early weeks of the “COVID-19 pandemic” (19 March to 15 April 2020). Second, demographic and symptom data were compared across all patients who started an assessment during the comparison (n = 1650) and the COVID-19 period (n = 1668). Third, responses to questions about the impact of COVID-19 introduced to the assessment from 19 March 2020, and reports from treating therapists were examined. Results: There was an 89% increase in website visits and a 90% increase in telephone calls to the clinic in the early COVID-19 period compared to the comparison period. There was a higher proportion of females in the COVID-19 sample (76.9% vs. 72.9%), and a lower proportion reported being in employment (52.8% vs. 60.8%). There was a small but significant increase in the severity of anxiety symptoms, and an increase in the number of people reporting recent onset of anxiety and depression. However, there were no differences between groups in severity of symptoms of distress or depression. Most people (94%) reported concern about the impact of COVID-19, and 88% reported making changes in lifestyle. Older adults had higher levels of concern about COVID-19. Therapists reported that patients were concerned about how to access testing, manage quarantine, financial security and the effect of social isolation. Conclusions: COVID-19 has resulted in a significant increase in contact with an established DMHS, but we have not yet detected increases in baseline symptom severity. With the prospect of prolonged restriction of movement, DMHS such as MindSpot could play an important role in both providing clinical services and monitoring the mental health of the population.","Titov, Nickolai; Staples, Lauren; Kayrouz, Rony; Cross, Shane; Karin, Eyal; Ryan, Katie; Dear, Blake; Nielssen, Olav",Internet Interv.,,438

Loneliness (hardly ever/some of the time/often) was assessed by the question ""In the past 30 days, how often did you feel alone/lonely?"". Social disconnectedness included information on social contacts through virtual talking (i.e. telephone, Skype, WhatsApp, or social media) and outside-home meetings with people living in another household. Covariates included sociodemographic and health related characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) with their 95% confidence interval (CI).Results: The overall prevalence of loneliness during the pandemic was 23.9% (95% CI 20.7-27.5); lower than in the pre-pandemic period (32.8%; 95% CI 28.6-37.4). In the pandemic period, 20.1% (95% CI 16.9-23.6) reported some of the time feeling lonely and 3.9% (95% CI 3.1-4.8) reported often feeling lonely. In the fully adjusted model, virtual talking disconnectedness (OR=1.67; 95% CI 1.09-2.56) was positively associated with some of the time feeling lonely and outside-home disconnectedness (OR=0.33; 95% CI 0.18-0.60) was negatively associated with often feeling lonely.Conclusion: Individuals with virtual talking disconnectedness and without outside-home disconnectedness are at higher risk of loneliness during the time of COVID-19 pandemic.

We first formulate a microscopic multi-agent epidemic model where every agent can choose its activity level that affects the spread of the disease. Then by minimizing agents' cost functions, we solve for the optimal decisions for individual agents in the framework of game theory and multi-agent reinforcement learning. Given the optimal decisions of all agents, we can make predictions about the spread of the disease. We show that there are negative externalities in the sense that infected agents do not have enough incentives to protect others, which then necessitates external interventions to regulate agents' behaviors. In the discussion section, future directions are pointed out to make the model more realistic.","Liu, Changliu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12959v1.pdf,438

RESULTS: A national survey conducted during the year 2020 across the French reference centers for hemoglobinopathies identified 16 cases of COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR in beta-thalassemia patients. Their age ranged from 11 months to 60 years. 15 patients were transfusion-dependent and 6 were splenectomized. Concerning iron overload related complications, none had diabetes or cirrhosis and only one had experienced heart failure. All 4 pediatric patients were pauci-symptomatic during the viral episode. Three patients (41, 49 and 57 years old) developed COVID-19 pneumonia requiring oxygen therapy without the need for mechanical ventilation. Neutropenia (absolute neutrophils count <0.5 10 9/L) was observed in 2 patients receiving long-term treatment with hydroxycarbamide and deferiprone. No thrombosis event, organ failure or death occurred. All patients recovered. CONCLUSION: Severity of COVID-19 in this population of young and middle-aged patients appeared increased compared to the general population but remained mild to moderate as already described in the few series reported in the literature.

224229,COVID-19 Detection Empowered with Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques: A Systematic Review,2021,"This study was conducted to verify the perceived restorativeness of citizens visiting forests on social-psychological stress and psychological resilience according to forest space type. The study involved a questionnaire survey conducted on citizens who visited forests between 1 May and 15 July 2020, when social distancing in daily life was being implemented. Three types of forest spaces (urban forest, national park, and natural recreation forest) were selected for the survey. They used the survey results of 1196 people as analysis data for this study. In this study, the PRS (Perceived Restorativeness Scale) and the PWI-SF (Psychosocial Well-being Index Short Form) were used to evaluate perceived restorativeness and social-psychological stress of citizens visiting forests. In the study, the average score of visitors' perceived restorativeness was 5.31 ± 0.77. Social-psychological stress was found in the healthy group, potential stress group, and high-risk group. These groups made up 8.0%, 82.5%, and 9.5% of the respondents, respectively. Pearson's correlation analysis between perceived restorativeness and social-psychological stress revealed that the higher the perceived restorativeness, the lower the social-psychological stress. ""Diversion Mood"", ""Not bored"", and ""Coherence"", which are the sub-factors of perceived restorativeness according to the forest space type, were found to have meaningful results for psychological resilience. However, there was no significant difference in the forest space type between ""Compatibility"" and social-psychological stress, which are sub-factors of perceived restorativeness. In conclusion, the forest space type affects the psychological resilience of those who visit the forest. Urban forests, national parks, and natural recreation forests are places to reduce stress.","Lee, Don-Gak; Lee, Mi-Mi; Jeong, Young-Mi; Kim, Jin-Gun; Yoon, Yung-Kyoon; Shin, Won-Sop",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,438

230261,Prognostics and health management to improve resilient manufacturing,2020,"Our work represents another step into the detection and prevention of these ever-more present political manipulation efforts. We, therefore, start by focusing on understanding what the state-of-the-art approaches lack -- since the problem remains, this is a fair assumption. We find concerning issues within the current literature and follow a diverging path. Notably, by placing emphasis on using data features that are less susceptible to malicious manipulation and also on looking for high-level approaches that avoid a granularity level that is biased towards easy-to-spot and low impact cases. We designed and implemented a framework -- Twitter Watch -- that performs structured Twitter data collection, applying it to the Portuguese Twittersphere. We investigate a data snapshot taken on May 2020, with around 5 million accounts and over 120 million tweets (this value has since increased to over 175 million). The analyzed time period stretches from August 2019 to May 2020, with a focus on the Portuguese elections of October 6th, 2019. However, the Covid-19 pandemic showed itself in our data, and we also delve into how it affected typical Twitter behavior. We performed three main approaches: content-oriented, metadata-oriented, and network interaction-oriented. We learn that Twitter's suspension patterns are not adequate to the type of political trolling found in the Portuguese Twittersphere -- identified by this work and by an independent peer - nor to fake news posting accounts. We also surmised that the different types of malicious accounts we independently gathered are very similar both in terms of content and interaction, through two distinct analysis, and are simultaneously very distinct from regular accounts.","Ramalho, Miguel Sozinho",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04293v1.pdf,438

234785,"A Survey on Synchronous Augmented, Virtual and Mixed Reality Remote Collaboration Systems",2021-02-11,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has sounded alarm bells throughout global health systems. As of late May, 2020, over 100,000 COVID-19-related deaths were reported in the United States, which is the highest number of any country. This article describes COVID-19 as the next historical turning point in the physical therapy profession's growth and development. The profession has had over a 100-year tradition of responding to epidemics, including poliomyelitis; 2 world wars and geographical regions experiencing conflicts and natural disasters; and, the epidemic of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The evidence-based role of noninvasive interventions (nonpharmacological/nonsurgical) that hallmark physical therapist practice has emerged as being highly relevant today in addressing COVID-19 in 2 primary ways. First, despite some unique features, COVID-19 presents as acute respiratory distress syndrome in its severe acute stage. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is very familiar to physical therapists in intensive care units. Body positioning and mobilization, prescribed based on comprehensive assessments/examinations, counter the negative sequelae of recumbency and bedrest; augment gas exchange and reduce airway closure, deconditioning, and critical illness complications; and maximize long-term functional outcomes. Physical therapists have an indisputable role across the contiuum of COVID-19 care. Second, over 90% of individuals who die from COVID-19 have comorbidities, most notably cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic lung disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Physical therapists need to redouble their efforts to address NCDs by assessing patients for risk factors and manifestations and institute evidence-based health education (smoking cessation, whole-food plant-based nutrition, weight control, physical activity/exercise), and/or support patients' efforts when these are managed by other professionals. Effective health education is a core competency for addressing risk of death by COVID-19 as well as NCDs. COVID-19 is a wake-up call to the profession, an opportunity to assert its role throughout the COVID-19 care continuum, and augment public health initiatives by reducing the impact of the current pandemic.","Dean, Elizabeth; Jones, Alice; Yu, Homer Peng-Ming; Gosselink, Rik; Skinner, Margot",Phys Ther,,438

DESIGN: Comparative study based on a unique data set of COVID-19 and SARS. SETTING: Outbreak in mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: The final database included 82 858 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 5327 cases of SARS. METHODS: We brought together all existing data sources and integrated them into a comprehensive data set. Individual information on age, sex, occupation, residence location, date of illness onset, date of diagnosis and clinical outcome was extracted. Control measures deployed in mainland China were collected. We compared the epidemiological and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 and SARS. We estimated the effective reproduction number to explore differences in transmission dynamics and intervention effects. RESULTS: Compared with SARS, COVID-19 affected more extensive areas (1668 vs 230 counties) within a shorter time (101 vs 193 days) and had higher attack rate (61.8 vs 4.0 per million persons). The COVID-19 outbreak had only one epidemic peak and one epicentre (Hubei Province), while the SARS outbreak resulted in two peaks and two epicentres (Guangdong Province and Beijing). SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to infect older people (median age of 52 years), while SARS-CoV tended to infect young adults (median age of 34 years). The case fatality rate (CFR) of either disease increased with age, but the CFR of COVID-19 was significantly lower than that of SARS (5.6% vs 6.4%). The trajectory of effective reproduction number dynamically changed in relation to interventions, which fell below 1 within 2 months for COVID-19 and within 5.5 months for SARS. CONCLUSIONS: China has taken more prompt and effective responses to combat COVID-19 by learning lessons from SARS, providing us with some epidemiological clues to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic worldwide.","Zhao, Lin; Feng, Dan; Ye, Run-Ze; Wang, Hai-Tao; Zhou, Yu-Hao; Wei, Jia-Te; J de Vlas, Sake; Cui, Xiao-Ming; Jia, Na; Yin, Chao-Nan; Li, Shi-Xue; Wang, Zhi-Qiang; Cao, Wu-Chun",BMJ Open,,438

235773,"Tests, surgical masks, hospital beds, and ventilators: add big data to the list of tools to fight the coronavirus that are in short supply",2020,"Initial phase of COVID-19 infection is associated with the binding of viral spike protein S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) with the host cell surface receptor, ACE2. Peptide inhibitors typically interact with spike proteins in order to block its interaction with ACE2, and this knowledge would promote the use of such peptides as therapeutic scaffolds. The present study examined the competitive inhibitor activity of a broad spectrum antimicrobial peptide, Dermaseptin-S4 (S4) and its analogues. Three structural S4 analogues viz., S4 (K4), S4 (K20) and S4 (K4K20) were modelled by substituting charged lysine for non-polar residues in S4 and subsequently, docked with S1. Further, the comparative analysis of inter-residue contacts and non-covalent intermolecular interactions among S1-S4 (K4), S1-S4 (K4K20) and S1-ACE2 complexes were carried out to explore their mode of binding with S1. Interestingly, S1-S4 (K4) established more inter-molecular interactions compared to S4 (K4K20) and S1-ACE2. In order to substantiate this study, the normal mode analysis (NMA) was conducted to show how the structural stability of the flexible loop region in S1 is affected by atomic displacements in unbound S1 and docked complexes. Markedly, the strong interactions consistently maintained by S1-S4 (K4) complex revealed their conformational transition over the harmonic motion period. Moreover, S1-S4 (K4) peptide complex showed a higher energy deformation profile compared to S1-S4 (K4K20), where the higher energy deformation suggests the rigidity of the docked complex and thus it's harder deformability, which is also substantiated by molecular dynamics simulation. In conclusion, S1-S4 (K4) complex has definitely exhibited a functionally significant dynamics compared to S1-ACE2 complex; this peptide inhibitor, S4 (K4) will need to be considered as the best therapeutic scaffold to block SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Sekar, P Chandra; Rajasekaran, R",Int J Pept Res Ther,,438

Advances in pediatric cardiology shifted attention from mortality to morbidity and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients with CHD and impact on their families. The purposes of this study were to assess the validity and reliability of the Italian version of the Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) Cardiac Module and to create normative data for the Italian population. METHODS: This was an observational cross-sectional study of pediatric patients (aged 2-18 years) with congenital or acquired Heart Disease (HD) and their parents. Families were asked to complete the cardiac pediatric health-related quality of life questionnaire (the Italian PedsQL&#8482; 3.0 Cardiac Module) and the generic pediatric health-related quality of life questionnaire (PedsQL&#8482; 4.0 Generic Core Scales). The sequential validation procedure of the original United States version of the PedsQL&#8482; 3.0 Cardiac Module was carried out under the instruction of the MAPI Research Institute. To assess construct validity, Pearson's correlation coefficients were assessed between scores on the Cardiac Module scales and scores on the scales of the General Module. To determine agreement between patient self-report and parent proxy-report, we used intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). To evaluate Internal consistency of items, we used Cronbach's alpha Coefficient. RESULTS: The study enrolled 400 patients. Construct validity is good between PedsQL Cardiac Module total scores and PedsQL total scores (p < 0.001). The recommended standard value of 0.7 was reached on the Cardiac and General Module core scales. Intercorrelations between PedsQL Cardiac module and PedsQL scores revealed medium to large correlations. In general, correlations between Patient self-reports are poorer than Parent-proxy ones. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac PedsQL scores are valid and reliable for pediatric patients with congenital and acquired HD and may be useful for future research and clinical management.","Grimaldi Capitello, Teresa; Bevilacqua, Francesca; Vallone, Roberta; Dall039,; Oglio, Anna Maria; Santato, Francesca; Giannico, Salvatore; Calcagni, Giulio; Piga, Simone; Ciofi Degli Atti, Marta; Gentile, Simonetta; Rossi, Angela",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,,438

239016,Bias goggles: Exploring the bias of web domains through the eyes of users,2020,"BACKGROUND: Internationally, the COVID-19 pandemic severely curtailed access to hospital facilities for those awaiting elective/semi-elective procedures. For allergic children in Ireland, already waiting up to 4 years for an elective oral food challenge (OFC), the restrictions signified indefinite delay. At the time of the initiative, there were approx 900 children on the Children's Health Ireland (CHI) waiting list. In July 2020, a project was facilitated by short-term (6 weeks) access to an empty COVID stepdown facility built, in a hotel conference centre, commandeered by the Health Service Executive (HSE), Ireland. The aim of this study was to achieve the rapid roll-out of an offsite OFC service, delivering high throughput of long waiting patients, while aligning with existing hospital policies and quality standards, international allergy guidelines and national social distancing standards. METHODS: The working group engaged key stakeholders to rapidly develop an offsite OFC facility. Consultant paediatric allergists, consultant paediatricians, trainees and allergy clinical nurse specialists were seconded from other duties. The facility was already equipped with hospital beds, bedside monitors (BP, pulse and oxygen saturation) and bedside oxygen. All medication and supplies had to be brought from the base hospital. Daily onsite consultant anaesthetic cover was resourced and a resuscitation room equipped. Standardized food challenge protocols were created. Access to the onsite hotel chef facilitated food preparation. A risk register was established. RESULTS: After 6 weeks of planning, the remote centre became operational on 7/9/2020, with the capacity of 27 OFC/day. 474 challenges were commenced: 465 (98%) were completed and 9 (2%) were inconclusive. 135 (29%) OFCs were positive, with 25 (5%) causing anaphylaxis. No child required advanced airway intervention. 8 children were transferred to the base hospital. The CHI allergy waiting list was reduced by almost 60% in only 24 days. CONCLUSIONS: Oral food challenges remain a vital tool in the care of allergic children, with their cost saving and quality-of-life benefits negatively affected by a delay in their delivery. This project has shown it is possible to have huge impacts on a waiting list efficiently, effectively and safely with good planning and staff buy-in-even in a pandemic. Adoption of new, flexible and efficient models of service delivery will be important for healthcare delivery in the post-COVID-19 era.","Byrne, Aideen M; Trujillo, Juan; Fitzsimons, John; Mohammed, Tariq; Ghent, Robert; O039,; Carroll, Cathryn; Coghlan, David; Hourihane, Jonathan O039; Alsalemi, Ali; Cassidy, Aoife; Corbet, Eva; Creighton, Rita; d039,; Art, Yvonne; Farren, Linda; Flanagan, Rachel; Flynn, Niamh; Franklin, Ruth; Gray, Claire; Harding, Paul; Hendrick, Ciara; Heraghty, Fionnuala; Hurley, Sadhbh; Kavanagh, Valerie; Lad, Dhanis; Leddy, Karen; Lewis, Sarah; McGlynn, Triona; Connor, Danielle; Neill, Phil; Shea, Orla; Toole, Ann; Quinn, Rachel; Reid, Aisling; Russell, Alison; Ruth, Emma; Rynne, Anne; Sanneerappa, P Bhusan; Sheehan, Mairead; Thompson, Claire; Tobin, Ciara; Trayer, James; Wallace, Alison; Walsh, Nicola; Wilson, Fiona",Pediatr. allergy immunol,,438
240412,An organized review of key factors for fake news detection,2021-02-26,"BACKGROUND: National governments worldwide have implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions to control the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigate its effects. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the prediction of future daily national confirmed COVID-19 infection growth-the percentage change in total cumulative cases-across 14 days for 114 countries using nonpharmaceutical intervention metrics and cultural dimension metrics, which are indicative of specific national sociocultural norms. METHODS: We combined the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker data set, Hofstede cultural dimensions, and daily reported COVID-19 infection case numbers to train and evaluate five non-time series machine learning models in predicting confirmed infection growth. We used three validation methods-in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and country-based cross-validation-for the evaluation, each of which was applicable to a different use case of the models. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate high R2 values between the labels and predictions for the in-distribution method (0.959) and moderate R2 values for the out-of-distribution and country-based cross-validation methods (0.513 and 0.574, respectively) using random forest and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) regression. Although these models may be used to predict confirmed infection growth, the differing accuracies obtained from the three tasks suggest a strong influence of the use case. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides new considerations in using machine learning techniques with nonpharmaceutical interventions and cultural dimensions as metrics to predict the national growth of confirmed COVID-19 infections.","Yeung, Arnold Ys; Roewer-Despres, Francois; Rosella, Laura; Rudzicz, Frank",J Med Internet Res,,438
241807,Identifying mortality factors from Machine Learning using Shapley values - a case of COVID19,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the primary receptor to enter host cells and initiate the infection. The critical binding region of ACE2 is an â¼30-amino-acid (aa)-long helix. Here, we report the design of four stapled peptides based on the ACE2 helix, which is expected to bind to SARS-CoV-2 and prevent the binding of the virus to the ACE2 receptor and disrupt the infection. All stapled peptides showed high helical contents (50 to 94% helicity). In contrast, the linear control peptide NYBSP-C showed no helicity (19%). We have evaluated the peptides in a pseudovirus-based single-cycle assay in HT1080/ACE2 cells and human lung cell line A549/ACE2, overexpressing ACE2. Three of the four stapled peptides showed potent antiviral activity in HT1080/ACE2 (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50]: 1.9 to 4.1 µM) and A549/ACE2 (IC50: 2.2 to 2.8 µM) cells. The linear peptide NYBSP-C and the double-stapled peptide StRIP16, used as controls, showed no antiviral activity. Most significantly, none of the stapled peptides show any cytotoxicity at the highest dose tested. We also evaluated the antiviral activity of the peptides by infecting Vero E6 cells with the replication-competent authentic SARS-CoV-2 (US_WA-1/2020). NYBSP-1 was the most efficient, preventing the complete formation of cytopathic effects (CPEs) at an IC100 of 17.2 µM. NYBSP-2 and NYBSP-4 also prevented the formation of the virus-induced CPE with an IC100 of about 33 µM. We determined the proteolytic stability of one of the most active stapled peptides, NYBSP-4, in human plasma, which showed a half-life (T 1/2) of >289 min.IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus with many unknowns. No vaccine or specific therapy is available yet to prevent and treat this deadly virus. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutics. Structural studies revealed critical interactions between the binding site helix of the ACE2 receptor and SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD). Therefore, targeting the entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2 is ideal for both prevention and treatment as it blocks the first step of the viral life cycle. We report the design of four double-stapled peptides, three of which showed potent antiviral activity in HT1080/ACE2 cells and human lung carcinoma cells, A549/ACE2. Most significantly, the active stapled peptides with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 showed high &#945;-helicity (60 to 94%). The most active stapled peptide, NYBSP-4, showed substantial resistance to degradation by proteolytic enzymes in human plasma. The lead stapled peptides are expected to pave the way for further optimization of a clinical candidate.","Curreli, Francesca; Victor, Sofia M B; Ahmed, Shahad; Drelich, Aleksandra; Tong, Xiaohe; Tseng, Chien-Te K; Hillyer, Christopher D; Debnath, Asim K",mBio (Online),,438
242745,Cutting Cubes Out of Fog: The Whole View of Design,2020,"Laboratory medicine provides an almost irreplaceable contribution to the diagnostic reasoning and managed care of most human pathologies. The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not an exception to this paradigm. Although the relatively recent emergence does not allow to draw definitive conclusions on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnostics, some standpoints can be conveyed. First and foremost, it seems now clear that we will be living together with this virus for quite a long time, so that our vigilance and responsiveness against the emergence of new local outbreaks shall be maintained at the highest possible levels. The etiological diagnosis of COVID-19 is, and will remain for the foreseeable future, deeply based on direct identification of viral RNA by means of molecular biology techniques in biological materials, especially upper and lower respiratory tract specimens. Whether other materials, such as blood, urine, stools, saliva and throat washing, will become valid alternatives has not been unequivocally defined so far. As concerns serological testing, promising information can be garnered from preliminary investigations, showing that the vast majority of COVID-19 patients seem to develop a sustained immune response against the virus, characterized especially by emergence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA, 1 to 2 weeks after the onset of fever and/or respiratory symptoms. Whether these antibodies will have persistent neutralizing activity against the virus is still to be elucidated on individual and general basis. The availability of rapid tests for detecting either viral antigens or anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are a potentially viable opportunity for purposes of epidemiologic surveillance, though more information is needed on accuracy and reliability of these portable immunoassays.","Lippi, Giuseppe; Mattiuzzi, Camilla; Bovo, Chiara; Plebani, Mario",Acta Biomed,,438

Certain drugs have several protein targets and many illnesses share overlapping molecular paths. In such cases, reusing drugs for more than one objective and finding their novice uses can considerably decrease the time in finding new cures for unforeseen diseases. Remdesivir has been recently a strong candidate for the treatment of Covid-19. In this commentary, we have portrayed the structure of the coronavirus in a simple way as well as the site where remdesivir acts. We have also displayed the ongoing clinical trials, as well as a published study that was conducted on compassionate base. The covid-19 pandemic might wean down by the end of summer 2020, but the risk of seasonality exists. Therefore, future disposal of agents such as remdesivir might be crucial for ensuring an efficient treatment, decrease mortality and allow early discharge.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The learning process, consisting of synchronous learning, is carried out internet (online), namely face-to-face by video calls/ zoom meetings and asynchronous, namely by assignments. Using observational data methods, interviews, and notes, the research approach used is a qualitative research method. The aim of this study is to provide some explanations of the use of the zoom meeting application during a pandemic in online learning, to evaluate the constraints of using the zoom meeting application and the benefits of the application for zoom meeting from several features during a pandemic in online learning. The findings of this study show that it can be easier for lecturers and students to interact synchronously in the learning process by applying the zoom meeting application to learning during this pandemic.","Gunawan, Guntur Kristiawan Muhammad Risdianto Eko Monicha Ririn Eka",Education Quarterly Reviews,,438
245074,An early prediction of covid-19 associated hospitalization surge using deep learning approach,2020-09-17,"The international scope of the Mediterranean wine trade in Late Antiquity raises important questions concerning sustainability in an ancient international economy and offers a valuable historical precedent to modern globalization. Such questions involve the role of intercontinental commerce in maintaining sustainable production within important supply regions and the vulnerability of peripheral regions believed to have been especially sensitive to environmental and political disturbances. We provide archaeobotanical evidence from trash mounds at three sites in the central Negev Desert, Israel, unraveling the rise and fall of viticulture over the second to eighth centuries of the common era (CE). Using quantitative ceramic data obtained in the same archaeological contexts, we further investigate connections between Negev viticulture and circum-Mediterranean trade. Our findings demonstrate interrelated growth in viticulture and involvement in Mediterranean trade reaching what appears to be a commercial scale in the fourth to mid-sixth centuries. Following a mid-sixth century peak, decline of this system is evident in the mid- to late sixth century, nearly a century before the Islamic conquest. These findings closely correspond with other archaeological evidence for social, economic, and urban growth in the fourth century and decline centered on the mid-sixth century. Contracting markets were a likely proximate cause for the decline; possible triggers include climate change, plague, and wider sociopolitical developments. In long-term historical perspective, the unprecedented commercial florescence of the Late Antique Negev appears to have been unsustainable, reverting to an age-old pattern of smaller-scale settlement and survival-subsistence strategies within a time frame of about two centuries.","Fuks, Daniel; Bar-Oz, Guy; Tepper, Yotam; Erickson-Gini, Tali; Langgut, Dafna; Weissbrod, Lior; Weiss, Ehud",Proc.

247349,Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to Predict Student Performance during the COVID-19,2021,"PURPOSE: Seroprevalence surveys from different countries have reported SARS CoV-2 antibodies below 20% even in the most adversely affected areas and herd immunity cannot be predicted till more than half of the population gets the disease. The purpose of this survey was to estimate the magnitude of community-based spread of the infection, associated immunity, and the future prospects and proximity to a 'herd community'. METHODS: The study was undertaken as a cluster randomized, cross-sectional countrywide survey. This largest community-based seroprevalence data of SARS-CoV-2 were collected between 15th and 31st July, 2020 from seven randomly selected cities belonging to the three most populous provinces of Pakistan. The FDA approved kit of ROCHE was used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RESULTS: Serum samples of 15,390 participants were tested for SARS CoV-2 antibodies with an overall seroprevalence of 42.4%. The seroprevalence ranged from 31.1% to 48.1% in different cities with the highest in Punjab province (44.5%). In univariable analysis, the odds of seropositivity was higher in men compared to women (OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.01-1.19, P < 0.05). In multivariable analysis, the risk of being seropositive was lower (OR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.60-0.87, P < 0.01) in younger group (&#8804; 20 years) than in those aged above 60 years. CONCLUSION: The study concluded that despite a reasonable seroprevalence, the country is yet to reach the base minimum of estimations for herd immunity. The durability of immunity though debated at the moment, has shown an evidenced informed shift towards longer side.","Haq, Mohsina; Rehman, Asif; Ahmad, Junaid; Zafar, Usman; Ahmed, Sufyan; Khan, Mumtaz Ali; Naveed, Asif; Rajab, Hala; Muhammad, Fawad; Naushad, Wasifa; Aman, Muhammad; Rehman, Hafeez Ur; Ahmad, Sajjad; Anwar, Saeed; Haq, Najib Ul",Infection,,438

An understanding of this function can yield valuable data to future research on how to inhibit the virus? infection of a host. The TM region of the protein is not as well studied due to the complication that nonpolar peptides can have in large groups;therefore, an understanding of this region could lead to novel discoveries. A peptide of the TM domain must be synthesized by using Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, in which a resin is utilized to build a peptide off the c-terminus using Fmoc-protected amino acids and a strong base. A fluorescence assay can be performed to determine its oligomerization state by looking at the change of fluorescence that occurs when a quencher is added to the solution. Once the oligomerization state of the spike proteins TM domain is determined, this information will be beneficial the development of drugs against the virus. The set up to run this synthesis was developed in the lab and is causing premature termination of the amino acid chain. Current work involves addressing a potential issue of hydrophobicity due to the volume non-polar residues, which is currently being address by trying a TGR resin that has a polystyrene core which is suited for long peptides. It is anticipated that addressing this issue will lead to a peptide that can be purified.

In this scenario, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) offer fast, automated, effective strategies to detect abnormalities and extract key features of the altered lung parenchyma, which may be related to specific signatures of the COVID-19 virus. However, the available COVID-19 datasets are inadequate to train deep neural networks. Therefore, we propose a new concept called domain extension transfer learning (DETL). We employ DETL, with pre-trained deep convolutional neural network, on a related large chest X-Ray dataset that is tuned for classifying between four classes viz. $normal$, $other\_disease$, $pneumonia$ and $Covid-19$. A 5-fold cross validation is performed to estimate the feasibility of using chest X-Rays to diagnose COVID-19. The initial results show promise, with the possibility of replication on bigger and more diverse data sets. The overall accuracy was measured as $95.3\% \pm 0.02$. In order to get an idea about the COVID-19 detection transparency, we employed the concept of Gradient Class Activation Map (Grad-CAM) for detecting the regions where the model paid more attention during the classification. This was found to strongly correlate with clinical findings, as validated by experts.","Basu, Sanhita; Mitra, Sushmita; Saha, Nilanjan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10507v3.pdf,438
254852,Learn on the Fly,,"The global spread of COVID-19 has created an urgent need for a safe and effective vaccine. However, in the United States, the politicization of the vaccine approval process, including which public figures are endorsing it, could undermine beliefs about its safety and efficacy and willingness to receive it. Using a pair of randomized survey experiments, we show that announcing approval of a COVID-19 vaccine one week before the presidential election compared to one week after considerably reduces both beliefs about its safety and efficacy and intended uptake. However, endorsement by Dr. Anthony Fauci increases confidence and uptake among all partisan subgroups. Further, an endorsement by Dr. Fauci increased uptake and confidence in safety even if a vaccine receives pre-election approval. The results here suggest that perceptions of political influence in COVID-19 vaccine approval could significantly undermine the viability of a vaccine as a strategy to end the pandemic.","Bokemper, Scott E; Huber, Gregory A; Gerber, Alan S; James, Erin K; Omer, Saad B",Vaccine,,438

255120,Driving Sustainability through Engineering Management and Systems Engineering,2021,"Since the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic was first identified in early 2020, rare cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in pet cats have been reported worldwide. Some reports of cats with SARS-CoV-2 showed self-limiting respiratory or gastrointestinal disease after suspected human-to-feline transmission via close contact with humans with SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we investigated a cat with SARS-CoV-2 that was presented to a private animal clinic in Northern Italy in May 2020 in a weak clinical condition due to an underlying intestinal B-cell lymphoma. The cat developed signs of respiratory tract disease, including a sneeze, a cough and ocular discharge, three days after an oropharyngeal swab tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA using two real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays for the envelope (E) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detectable prior to the onset of clinical signs. Five and six months after positive molecular results, the serological testing substantiated the presence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection in the cat with the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies and neutralizing activity in a surrogate virus neutralization assay (sVNT). To the best of our knowledge, this extends the known duration of seropositivity of SARS-CoV-2 in a cat. Our study provides further evidence that cats are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 under natural conditions and strengthens the assumption that comorbidities may play a role in the development of clinical disease.","Klaus, Julia; Palizzotto, Carlo; Zini, Eric; Meli, Marina L; Leo, Chiara; Egberink, Herman; Zhao, Shan; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina",Viruses,,438

The COVID-19 pandemic has clearly demonstrated the cost of failing to incorporate a human rights framework as one of the essential core capacity requirements for meeting the IHR. The Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Infectious Diseases (APSED) was developed to assist the two regional offices member states come to grips with the capacities required under the revised IHR. I found that though there were profound differences between them, overall, ASEAN states had responded positively to the concept of shared infectious disease surveillance and the reporting of infectious disease outbreaks, both endemic and emerging diseases, to neighbouring states.

Neuroendocrine liver metastases (NELM) are heterogeneous in clinical presentation and prognosis. Fortunately, recent advances in diagnostic techniques and therapeutic strategies have improved the multidisciplinary management of this challenging condition. When feasible, surgical resection of NELM offers the best long-term outcomes. General indications for hepatic resection include performance status acceptable for major liver surgery, grade 1 or 2 tumors, absence of extrahepatic disease, adequate size and function of future liver remnant, and feasibility of resecting >90% of metastases. Adjunct therapies including concomitant liver ablation are generally safe when used appropriately and may expand the number of patients eligible for surgery. Among patients with synchronous resectable NELM, resection of the primary either in a staged or combined fashion is recommended. For patients who are not surgical candidates, liver-directed therapies such as transarterial embolization, chemoembolization, and radioembolization can provide locoregional control and improve symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. Multiple systemic therapy options also exist for patients with advanced or progressive disease. Ongoing research efforts are needed to identify novel biomarkers that will define the optimal indications for and sequencing of treatments to be delivered in a personalized fashion.","Cloyd, Jordan M; Ejaz, Aslam; Konda, Bhavana; Makary, Mina S; Pawlik, Timothy M",Hepatobiliary Surg Nutr,,438

258431,Flexible business strategies to enhance resilience in manufacturing supply chains: An empirical study,2020,"Tall buildings in cold climates have unique challenges in maintaining indoor air quality due to stack effect. During the heating season, interior air buoyancy creates large pressure differentials in vertical shafts that can drive airflow from lower floors into upper floors. This pressure differential can result in the spread of contaminants throughout a building. Most recently, concern over COVID-19 has increased attention to the potential spread of airborne diseases in densely populated buildings. For many multi-unit residential buildings, suite ventilation has traditionally relied upon fresh air supplied through a mechanically pressurized corridor. In cold climates, large pressure differentials created by stack-effect can reduce the effectiveness of this approach. Multizone and CFD simulations are employed to analyze airflow and contaminant spread due to stack effect. Simulations are conducted on an idealized model of a 10-storey building using a range of experimentally derived airtightness parameters. Simulations demonstrate stack effect can reduce corridor ventilation to suites and even reverse the airflow for leakier buildings. Reduced airflow to suites can result in the accumulation of contaminants. Reversal of the airflow can allow contaminants from a suite to spread throughout the building. Contaminant spread is illustrated as a function of mechanical ventilation, building airtightness, and ambient temperatures. Strategies to reduce the influence of stack effect on mechanically pressurized corridors are discussed.","Mckeen, Philip; Liao, Zaiyi",Build Simul,,438

263190,Is There a Place for Responsible Artificial Intelligence in Pandemics? A Tale of Two Countries,2021,"'Keep calm and carry on' was a wartime message to the British public that has achieved renewed fame in the last few years. The strategy was simple: in times of extreme difficulty a cool head combined with stoicism is an appropriate response to ensure a successful outcome. The latest major challenge to society (COVID-19) met with a very different response, and only history will reveal whether 'Stay home and worry' will be equally effective. In devising blueprints or strategies it is extremely important to have a clear idea of what you are trying to achieve, whether it be maintaining world freedom or stopping a pandemic. In the case of livestock agriculture, it is helping to feed a rapidly growing global population in harmony with the needs of current and future generations. I hope that I have stated this clearly, and calmly. If so, I ask you to picture a scene. We are on a Calm Farm. Dairy animals go about their daily lives contented, unhurried and focused on the simple feeding and socialising activities that are so important to them. Unstressed, their productive capacities and abilities to avoid and, when necessary, cope with physiological and pathological challenges are maximised. They are not alone: the exact same characteristics also apply to the farmer and husbandry staff that we meet. How is this calm farming approach relevant to the aspirations we had when we established the EU COST Action DairyCare? Our objective was to harness the power of computing technologies to assist our management of dairy livestock. A simple rearrangement leads us to Computing Assisted Livestock Management, CALM. In this short Research Reflection I shall assess how far we have come towards the achievement of sensible goals related to technological assessment of dairy animal wellbeing, and speculate on what more things both can and need to be done to finish the job. It is a personal account. DairyCare was a major collaboration involving several hundred active researchers. To involve them all would be impossible, and I do not pretend to speak for them all. As will become evident, the wide skills base that was assembled was so successful in its primary objectives that different skills, chiefly in economics, are now needed to exploit all of the technological advance that has been achieved. DairyCare succeeded in a second direction. Whilst the focus was technology development, by assembling a large cohort of biologists with animal welfare interests, it soon became apparent that technology should run alongside and help to enable improved management practices. This Special Issue is, therefore, in two sections. The first is dedicated to technology development and the second to a novel management practice that has the potential to significantly improve the wellbeing of cows and calves: cow-calf contact rearing. That section is introduced by my DairyCare colleague, Sigrid Agenäs.","Knight, Christopher H",J Dairy Res,,438

263433,Priorities and challenges of the EU energy transition:From the European Green Package to the new Green Deal,2020,"The purpose of this 2-part commentary series is to explain why we believe our ability to control injury risk by manipulating training load (TL) in its current state is an illusion and why the foundations of this illusion are weak and unreliable. In part 1, we introduce the training process framework and contextualize the role of TL monitoring in the injury-prevention paradigm. In part 2, we describe the conceptual and methodologic pitfalls of previous authors who associated TL and injury in ways that limited their suitability for the derivation of practical recommendations. The first important step in the training process is developing the training program: the practitioner develops a strategy based on available evidence, professional knowledge, and experience. For decades, exercise strategies have been based on the fundamental training principles of overload and progression. Training-load monitoring allows the practitioner to determine whether athletes have completed training as planned and how they have coped with the physical stress. Training load and its associated metrics cannot provide a quantitative indication of whether particular load progressions will increase or decrease the injury risk, given the nature of previous studies (descriptive and at best predictive) and their methodologic weaknesses. The overreliance on TL has moved the attention away from the multifactorial nature of injury and the roles of other important contextual factors. We argue that no evidence supports the quantitative use of TL data to manipulate future training with the purpose of preventing injury. Therefore, determining ""how much is too much"" and how to properly manipulate and progress TL are currently subjective decisions based on generic training principles and our experience of adjusting training according to an individual athlete's response. Our message to practitioners is to stop seeking overly simplistic solutions to complex problems and instead embrace the risks and uncertainty inherent in the training process and injury prevention.","Impellizzeri, Franco M; Menaspà, Paolo; Coutts, Aaron J; Kalkhoven, Judd; Menaspà, Miranda J",J Athl Train,,438

We describe the feasibility and interim outcome of implementing a modified imaging algorithm for COVID-19 risk stratification across a regional network of primary stroke centers in the work-up of acute ischemic stroke referrals for time-critical mechanical thrombectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We undertook a retrospective review of 49 patients referred to the regional neuroscience unit for consideration of mechanical thrombectomy between April 14, 2020, and May 21, 2020. During this time, all referring units followed a standard imaging protocol that included a chest CT in addition to a head CT and CT angiogram to identify Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infective pulmonary changes. RESULTS: Overall, 2 patients had typical COVID-19 radiologic features and tested positive, while 7 patients had indeterminate imaging findings and tested negative. The others had normal or atypical changes and were not diagnosed with or suspected of having COVID-19. There was an overall sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 74.1%, negative predictive value of 100%, and positive predictive value of 22.2% when using chest CT to diagnose COVID-19 in comparison with the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test. The mean additional time and radiation dose incurred for the chest CT were 184 ± 65.5 seconds and 2.47 ± 1.03 mSv. Multiple cardiovascular and pulmonary incidental findings of clinical relevance were identified in our patient population. CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT provides a pragmatic, rapid additional tool for COVID-19 risk stratification among patients referred for mechanical thrombectomy. Its inclusion in a standardized regional stroke imaging protocol has enabled efficient use of hospital resources with minimal compromise or delay to the overall patient treatment schedule.","Dhillon, P S; Pointon, K; Lenthall, R; Nair, S; Subramanian, G; McConachie, N; Izzath, W",AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,,438

First, the health impacts of air quality are estimated by using the concentrations estimated by multiscale air quality modeling and the recommended concentration–response functions (CRF), specifically as a result of exposure to particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3). Second, the associated external costs are calculated by monetization techniques. Two scenarios are analyzed: a package including existing measures (WM2030) and a package with additional measures (WAM2030). Compared with the baseline scenario, an improvement was found in the health effects of NO2, PM10, and PM2.5, while for O3 there was a slight worsening, mainly due to the increase in the O3 metric used (SOMO35), which increases over some urban areas. Despite this, the monetary valuation of the total effects on health as a whole shows external benefits due to the adoption of measures (WM2030), compared with the reference scenario (no measures) of more than € 17.5 billion and, when considering the additional measures (WAM2030), benefits of about € 58.1 billion.","Gamarra, Ana R.; Lechón, Yolanda Vivanco Marta G.; Garrido, Juan Luis Martín Fernando Sánchez Eugenio Theobald Mark Richard Gil Victoria Santiago José Luis",Atmosphere,,438

Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences. AIMS: To evaluate mental health outcomes among Egyptian healthcare workers (HCW) treating patients with confirmed or suspected Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) to direct the promotion of mental wellbeing, by screening for symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, depression and stress, and analyzing potential risk factors. METHODS: This cross-sectional, hospital-based survey study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 502 HCW dealing with COVID-19. HCW were surveyed in 20 hospitals (Fever, Chest, and Quarantine hospitals) in different parts of Egypt, in April and May 2020. RESULTS: Among the 502 HCW surveyed; 60.0% were physicians, 16.1% were specialized nurses, and 23.9% were non-specialized nurses. About 35.3% worked in chest hospitals, 17.5% in fever hospitals, and 47.2% in quarantine hospitals. A considerable proportion of HCW had symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, depression, and stress. Females were at higher risk of experiencing symptoms of severe anxiety (odds ratio [OR], 1.85; 95% CI, 1.12-3.05; p = .016), severe depression (OR, 2.013; 95% CI, 1.17-3.4; p = .011), and severe stress (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.5-4.6; p < .001). Fever hospital workers were at higher risk of severe depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; p < .01), compared to Quarantine hospital workers.

A Research Preview,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Mitral regurgitation (MR) is defined as an abnormal reversal of blood flow from the left ventricle to the left atrium (LA). It is caused by disruption in any part of the mitral valve apparatus. Surgical intervention remains the mainstay of management for severe cases. CASE SUMMARY: We are reporting a case of pneumonia with severe sepsis, that had a complicated hospital course. The patient developed multi-organ failure. Echocardiography on admission showed severe mitral regurgitation. He required early mechanical ventilation and then Veno-venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (VV-ECMO) over 29 days. He might be the first case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in our hospital. Mitral valve replacement was done after stabilization of the patient and weaning from the ECMO. DISCUSSION: Our report demonstrates that the use of a long term VV-ECMO as a bridge for stabilization, facilitates management of the critically ill respiratory failure patient with severe MR and patient outcomes. Still the long-term results and the optimal timing of intervention need more research to define. CONCLUSION: Our report demonstrates that the use of a long term VV ECMO facilitates management of patients with respiratory failure associated with severe MR. Future studies focusing on stabilizing such patients, might help to define the optimal timing for intervention in these patients and the long-term outcome.","Abdalghafoor, Tamer; Sarhan, Hatem; Kindawi, Ali",Perfusion,,438

Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus of this disease, belongs to the ß-coronavirus family, together with SARS and middle east respiratory syndrome, and has similar biological characteristics to these viruses. For obstetricians, the susceptibility and prognoses of pregnant women and the effects of the infection on the fetus have been the focus of attention; however, at present, the seriousness of the disease in pregnant women is not apparent, and COVID-19 does not increase the rate of miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm labor or teratogenicity. Even so, carriers might transmit SARS-CoV-2 to pregnant women. Thus, we must keep in mind that all medical personnel must understand and maintain standard precautions in their clinical and laboratory practices.","Hayakawa, Satoshi; Komine-Aizawa, Shihoko; Mor, Gil G",J. obstet. gynaecol. res,,438

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of telemedicine in patient follow-up and patient compliance in different communication methods. Materials and Methods: All patients discharged from a referral pulmonary hospital dedicated to coronavirus infected patients were given instructions on follow-up of symptoms. One group received messages via short message system regarding the severity of their symptoms. For the other group a mobile application was specially designed for tracking their well-being on a daily basis. Severity of symptoms and course of disease were monitored in each group for a two-month period. Results: A total 1091 patients with mean age of 53.96+/- 17.95 years were enrolled in the study. In the first group 406 (60.14%) messages were successfully sent, from which 150 (36.94%) patients replied. Also, 243(35%) patients contacted us by making phone calls. Of the total patients in the second group, 153(64%) patients started using the mobile application. Chief complaint of patients was mainly cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, and myalgia. Deep vein thrombosis, hyperglycemia, post kidney transplant patient and bloody diarrhea were among the reported cases. Conclusion: Patient follow-up during epidemics, especially when the disease course is unknown, is an important step in both successful patient management and disease control. This study showed the role of telemedicine for patient follow-up, mostly in detecting special situations. But, in order to be successful patient education and active follow-up are important factors that must be considered.","Fadaizadeh, L.; Jamaati, H.; Varahram, M.; Taheri, M.

In culture of pneumocytes, the captopril/candesartan-induced ACE2 up-regulation was associated with inhibition of ADAM17 activity, counterbalancing increased ACE2 expression, which was associated with reduced SARS-CoV-2 spike protein entry. If confirmed in humans, these results could become the pathophysiological background for justifying RAS inhibitors as cornerstone cardiovascular protectives even during COVID-19 pandemic.","Simko, Fedor; Baka, Tomas",Clin Sci (Lond),,438
273537,Proposal of close contact confirmation method in cyberspace for influencer marketing,2021,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the general unpreparedness of the research community to face biological data challenges in a timely manner. In these dramatic times, healthcare providers and virology researchers would have largely benefited from sound support from the information systems and database communities, able to produce systems that allow to explore data, compute statistics, and discover knowledge on the virus. [Question/problem] The research progress in emergency times is hindered by the lack of experience in organizing effective interaction between parties, possibly supported by specific tools. Streamlining the domain knowledge exchange through an appropriate requirement engineering practice is of paramount importance, not only in health crises but also in disaster management and cases of extreme weather hazards. [Principal ideas/results] To this end, we report on the lessons learnt by applying an agile interviewing method during the COVID-19 outbreak, involving several experts spanning from clinicians and geneticists, to biologists and virologists. We have preliminarily tested our approach for the creation of an integrative database and a search system for viral sequences;foreseen extensions of the system target visualization, question-driven data warehousing, and statistical reporting. [Contribution] We present a number of practical suggestions aimed at conducting interviews under extreme conditions, where the conventional requirement elicitation methods are not applicable.

A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Hospital Clinico San Carlos of Madrid, Spain. Thirty-six subjects from the COVID admission unit with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Conjunctival swabs were collected from 18 patients with conjunctivitis and 18 patients without conjunctivitis and RT-PCR was performed. Conjunctival swab was collected from both eyes of 36 patients (72 eyes), detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in conjunctival swab of two patients (5.5%). Among the 18 patients with conjunctivitis, only one of them (5.5%) showed positive results. Likewise, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in one patient without conjunctivitis (5.5%). The mean age of the 36 patients was 67.9 years (range, 28-92 years) and the male-to-female ratio was 0.44 (16:20). The mean days since the onset of COVID-19 symptoms until conjunctivitis manifestation was 8 (range, 1-24 days). The mean duration of the conjunctivitis was 3 days (range, 1-7 days). SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be detected in conjunctival swabs of both patients with and without conjunctivitis. This study revealed the same rate of positive results amongst the group with and without conjunctivitis, suggesting that detecting SARS-CoV-2 in ocular fluids is not conditioned on the presence of conjunctivitis. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in ocular samples highlights the role of the eye as a possible route of transmission of the disease.","Güemes-Villahoz, Noemi; Burgos-Blasco, Barbara; Arribi-Vilela, Ana; Arriola-Villalobos, Pedro; Rico-Luna, Carla M; Cuiña-Sardiña, Ricardo; Delgado-Iribarren, Alberto; García-Feijoó, Julián",J Med Virol,,438

One of the factors questioned is also to be the factors affecting the disease course. In this study, our aim is to determine the factors that affect the course of the disease in the hospitalised patients because of COVID-19 infection and to reveal whether the seasonal change has an effect on the disease course. METHODS: Our study was conducted on 1950 PCR test positive patients who were hospitalised for COVID-19 disease between March 16 and July 15. RESULTS: As the seasonal temperature increases, decrease in WBC, PLT and albumin levels and increase in LDH and AST levels were observed. Risk of need for ICU has been found statistically significant (P < .05) with the increase in the age, LDH levels and CRP levels and with the decrease in the Ca and Albumin levels. CONCLUSIONS: It is predicted with these results that, seasonal change might have affects on the clinical course of the disease, although it has no affect on the spread of the disease. And it might beneficial to check biochemical parameters such as LDH, CRP, Ca and Albumin to predict the course of the disease.","Solmaz, Ihsan; Özçaylak, Süleyman; Alakus, Ömer Faruk; Kiliç, Jehat; Kalin, Burhan Sami; Güven, Mehmet; Araç, Songül; Akkoç, Hasan",Int J Clin Pract,,438

We identified distal cCREs with age-increased activity linked to SARS-CoV-2 host entry gene TMPRSS2 in alveolar type 2 cells, which had immune regulatory signatures and harbored variants associated with respiratory traits. At the 3p21.31 COVID-19 risk locus, a candidate variant overlapped a distal cCRE linked to SLC6A20, a gene expressed in alveolar cells and with known functional association with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2.

Moreover, lockdowns were imposed in entire countries. This study aims to assess whether there was a downward trend in emergency general surgery (EGS) procedures accomplished throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and to determine patients' and diseases' characteristics. METHODS: This is a multicentric retrospective observational cohort analysis conducted on patients who underwent EGS procedures during the lockdown and the same period of the previous year in the three Third Level Hospitals of Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy. RESULTS: During the study period, 138 patients underwent EGS procedures versus the 197 patients operated on in 2019, meaning a 30.0% decrease in the number of surgeries performed. The incidence rate for EGS procedures was 2.5 surgeries per day during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 3.5 surgeries per day in 2019 (P<0.001). The characteristics of patients operated on in 2020 were comparable to those of patients who underwent EGS in 2019, except for the higher prevalence of male patients during the COVID-19 pandemic (76.8 vs. 55.8; P<0.001). No difference was recorded in disease severity between the two study periods. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant reduction in EGS procedures carried out was recorded.

Higher levels of stress were observed in children during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the level of their life satisfaction remained unchanged when compared with data from the pre-COVID-19 surveys. The pandemic also affected peer relationship quality and susceptibility to smartphone addiction, but not perceived parenting style nor academic engagement. Interestingly, peer relationship quality no longer predicted life satisfaction during the pandemic; perceived parenting styles and parent-child conversation time predicted life satisfaction. The results suggest a central role of parent-child relationship in supporting the psychological well-being of school-aged children during the pandemic.","Choi, Jihye; Park, Youjeong; Kim, Hye-Eun; Song, Jihyeok; Lee, Daeun; Lee, Eunhye; Kang, Hyeonjin; Lee, Jeeho; Park, Jihyeon; Lee, Ji-Woo; Ye, Seongeun; Lee, Seul; Ryu, Sohee; Kim, Yeojeong; Kim, Ye-Ri; Kim, Yu-Jin; Lee, Yuseon",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,438

283541,Cologne Consensus Conference A Meeting of the International Academy for CPD Accreditation A World Apart: We Are Together,2021,"AIM: This cross-sectional study, conducted from August to September 2020, examined nurses' stress, self-efficacy and nursing intentions when caring for COVID-19 patients and identified the predictors of nursing intentions during the pandemic. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has increased nurses' role expectations and imposed a heavy social responsibility. In particular, frontline nurses are under significant stress when caring for patients during a novel epidemic because of the lack of accurate information. METHODS: A total of 232 nurses with experience in providing care for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients from seven large hospitals in three cities in Korea completed the Perceived Stress Scale, Self-Efficacy Scale and Predictive Nursing Intention Scale. RESULTS: Multiple regression confirmed that completing COVID-19-related education and self-efficacy were significant predictors of nursing intentions during the current pandemic; the regression model explained 22.0% of the variance in nursing intentions. CONCLUSION: Stress did not affect frontline nurses' nursing intentions towards COVID-19 patient care, but completing COVID-19-related education and higher self-efficacy predicted improved nursing intentions. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Nurse leaders should recognize that to improve nursing intentions during a novel infection outbreak, infection-related education should be provided and strategies to improve self-efficacy should be implemented.","Heo, Yu-Mi; Lee, Miyoung; Jang, Sun Joo",J. nurs. manag,,438
283939,The energy-climate-health nexus in energy planning: A case study in Brazil,2020,"BACKGROUND: Prevalence estimates of suicidal thoughts and behaviours (STB) among clinically active healthcare professionals during the first wave of COVID19 pandemic are non-existing. The main aim of this study was to investigate the 30-day prevalence of STB and associated risk factors. METHODS: As part of the Recovering Emotionally from COVID study (RECOVID), 30-day STB among healthcare professionals (Nâ¯=â¯6,409) was assessed in an e-survey in healthcare settings in Belgium. The prevalence of STB and associated risk factors were estimated in multivariable models with individual-level and society-level measures of association. We used post-stratification weights to make the data representative for the entire clinical workforce in Belgium. RESULTS: Prevalence was 3.6% death wish, 1.5% suicide ideation, 1.0% suicide plan, and 0.0% suicide attempt. Thirty-day STB was (a) increased among respondents with lifetime and current mental disorders (mostly depression) and those hospitalized for COVID19 infection, (b) decreased among respondents with social support, and (c) unrelated to work environment. LIMITATIONS: This is an explorative cross-sectional study using multivariate models that generates specific hypotheses on the prevalence of and risk factors for STB during the COVID19 pandemic rather than testing specific pathways that lead to STB onset. CONCLUSIONS: Across age, gender, professional discipline, and exposure to COVID, lifetime and current mental disorders were highly associated with STB. These factors could guide governments and healthcare organizations in taking up responsibilities in preventing emotional problems and developing resilience among healthcare professionals during, but probably beyond, the current COVID19 pandemic.","Bruffaerts, Ronny; Voorspoels, Wouter; Jansen, Leontien; Kessler, Ronald C; Mortier, Philippe; Vilagut, Gemma; De Vocht, Joke; Alonso, Jordi",J Affect Disord,,438
284892,A Learning Approach to Robot-Agnostic Force-Guided High Precision Assembly,2020-10-15,"COVID-19 triggered widespread disruption in the lives of university students across the United States. We conducted 9 online focus groups with 30 students from a large public university to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the food choices of those displaced from their typical residences due to the pandemic. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first qualitative research to examine the changes in food choice for US university students due to COVID-19 and offer insight into why these changes occurred. Students in this study reported significant, and often negative, changes in food choices during the pandemic compared to when on campus. Many students described changes in the foods they ate, the amount consumed, and increased snacking behaviors. We found food availability and household roles to be powerful factors influencing food choices. Most students had returned to family homes with many students taking a passive role in activities that shape food choices. Parents usually purchased groceries and prepared meals with students eating foods made available to them. Increased free time contributed to boredom and snacking for some students, while for a few students with increased skills and/or agency, additional free time was used to plan and prepare meals. About a third of the students attributed eating different foods at home to food availability issues related to the pandemic such as groceries being out of stock, purchasing non-perishable foods, or the inability to get to a store. This information may be helpful to researchers and health promotion professionals interested in the effects of COVID-19 on student nutrition and related food behaviors, including those interested in the relationship between context and food choice.","Powell, Patricia K; Lawler, Sheleigh; Durham, Jo; Cullerton, Katherine",Appetite,,438
285172,Detection of COVID-19 from CT Images Using resnet50,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this project was to test the efficacy of a brief and novel online ambulatory intervention aimed at supporting psychological health and well-being for medical personnel and first responders during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Interested participants, n=28, actively employed as medical personnel, support staff and emergency responders, in the Midwestern USA in May-June of 2020, provided informed consent and were randomised to complete either low-dose or high-dose intervention, one time daily for 1 week via smartphone application. Each daily intervention included expressive writing, adaptive emotion regulation activity and (one vs two) positive emotion-generation activities, lasting 3-6 min a day. Ratings of negative and positive emotion were provided before and after each activity daily. Analyses tested compliance, acceptability, as well as efficacy at increasing positive emotion and decreasing negative emotion with each use and across time. RESULTS: The results indicated a 13% increase in positive emotion, t(25)=2.01, p=0.056; and decrease in negative emotion by 44%, t(25)=-4.00, p=0.001 across both doses. However, there was a clear advantage for individuals in the high-dose condition as daily boosts in positive emotion were significantly greater (an additional 9.4%) B=0.47, p=0.018. Overall, compliance was good. Acceptability ratings were good for those who completed the follow-up assessment. CONCLUSION: Front-line personnel, including medical staff and emergency responders, are experiencing unprecedented psychological stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. This investigation suggests both feasibility and efficacy for a brief, daily, ambulatory intervention which could provide essential psychological support to individuals at risk in the workplace.","Coifman, Karin G; Disabato, David D; Seah, T H Stanley; Ostrowski-Delahanty, Sarah; Palmieri, Patrick A; Delahanty, Douglas L; Gunstad, John",Occup. environ. med,,438

BACKGROUND: Anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic is prevalent in the nursing workforce, potentially affecting nurses' well-being and work performance. Identifying factors that could help maintain mental health and reduce coronavirus-related anxiety among front-line nurses is imperative. Currently, no studies have been conducted examining the influence of personal resilience, social support and organisational support in reducing COVID-19 anxiety among nurses. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 325 registered nurses from the Philippines using four standardized scales. RESULTS: Of the 325 nurses in the study, 123 (37.8%) were found to have dysfunctional levels of anxiety. Using multiple linear regression analyses, social support (ß = -0.142, p = .011), personal resilience (ß = -0.151, p = .008) and organisational support (ß = -0.127, p = .023) predicted COVID-19 anxiety. Nurse characteristics were not associated with COVID-19 anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Resilient nurses and those who perceived higher organisational and social support were more likely to report lower anxiety related to COVID-19. IMPLICATION FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: COVID-19 anxiety may be addressed through organisational interventions, including increasing social support, assuring adequate organisational support, providing psychological and mental support services and providing resilience-promoting and stress management interventions.","Labrague, Leodoro J; De Los Santos, Janet Alexis A",J. nurs. manag,,438

288234,Confusion over Europe's data-protection law is stalling scientific progress,2020,"Traditionally, clustering algorithms focus on partitioning the data into groups of similar instances. The similarity objective, however, is not sufficient in applications where a fair-representation of the groups in terms of protected attributes like gender or race, is required for each cluster. Moreover, in many applications, to make the clusters useful for the end-user, a balanced cardinality among the clusters is required. Our motivation comes from the education domain where studies indicate that students might learn better in diverse student groups and of course groups of similar cardinality are more practical e.g., for group assignments. To this end, we introduce the fair-capacitated clustering problem that partitions the data into clusters of similar instances while ensuring cluster fairness and balancing cluster cardinalities. We propose a two-step solution to the problem: i) we rely on fairlets to generate minimal sets that satisfy the fair constraint and ii) we propose two approaches, namely hierarchical clustering and partitioning-based clustering, to obtain the fair-capacitated clustering. The hierarchical approach embeds the additional cardinality requirements during the merging step while the partitioning-based one alters the assignment step using a knapsack problem formulation to satisfy the additional requirements. Our experiments on four educational datasets show that our approaches deliver well-balanced clusters in terms of both fairness and cardinality while maintaining a good clustering quality.","Quy, Tai Le; Roy, Arjun; Friege, Gunnar; Ntoutsi, Eirini",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12116v2.pdf,438

292900,A Supervised Machine Learning Model For Imputing Missing Boarding Stops In Smart Card Data,2020-03-10,"INTRODUCTION: In Italy, hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination is achievable; however, barriers remain to achieving the World Health Organization's elimination targets, and have become more pronounced with the spread of COVID-19. Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P) is a direct-acting antiviral therapy for HCV, approved for 8-week treatment in patients without cirrhosis, and with compensated cirrhosis (CC). Previously, 12 weeks of therapy was recommended for patients with CC. Shortened treatment may reduce the burden on healthcare resources, allowing more patients to be treated. This study presents the benefits that 8-week vs 12-week treatment with G/P may have in Italy. METHODS: A multicohort Markov model was used to assess the collective number of healthcare visits and time on treatment with 8-week vs 12-week G/P in the HCV-infected population of Italy from 2019 to 2030, using healthcare resource data from post-marketing observational studies of G/P. Increased treatment capacity and downstream clinical and economic benefits were also assessed assuming the reallocation of saved healthcare visits to treat more patients. RESULTS: Modeled outcomes showed that by 2030, 8-week treatment saved 27,006 years on therapy compared with 12-week treatment, with 21,065 fewer hepatologist visits. Reallocating these resources to treat more patients could increase capacity to treat 5064 (1.4%) more patients with 8 weeks of G/P, all with CC. This increased treatment capacity would further avoid 2257 cases of end-stage liver disease, 893 liver-related deaths, and provide net savings to the healthcare system of nearly 70 million. CONCLUSION: The modeled comparisons between 8- and 12-week treatment with G/P show that shorter treatment duration can lead to greater time and resource savings, both in terms of healthcare visits and downstream costs. These benefits have the potential to enable the treatment of more patients to overcome elimination barriers in Italy through programs aimed to engage and treat targeted HCV populations.","Andreoni, Massimo; Di Perri, Giovanni; Persico, Marcello; Marcellusi, Andrea; Ethgen, Olivier; Sanchez Gonzalez, Yuri; Bondin, Mark; Zhang, Zhenzhen; De Michina, Antonella; Merolla, Rocco Cosimo Damiano; Craxì, Antonio",,,438

301234,Medical Imaging with Deep Learning for COVID- 19 Diagnosis: A Comprehensive Review,2021,"Most of the nations with deplorable health conditions lack rapid COVID-19diagnostic test due to limited testing kits and laboratories. The un-diagnosticmild cases (who show no critical sign and symptoms) play the role as a route that spread the infection unknowingly to healthy individuals. In this paper, we present a fractional order SIR model incorporating individual with mild cases as a compartment to become SMIR model. The existence of the solutions of the model is investigated by solving the fractional Gronwall's inequality using the Laplace transform approach. The equilibrium solutions (DFE & Endemic) are found to be locally asymptotically stable, and subsequently the basic reproduction number is obtained. Also the global stability analysis is carried out by constructing Lyapunov function. Lastly, numerical simulations that support analytic solution follow. It was also shown that when the rate of infection of the mild cases increases, there is equivalent increase in the overall population of infected individuals. Hence to curtail the spread of the disease there is need to take care of the Mild cases as well.","Baba, Isa Abdullahi; Nasidi, Bashir Ahmad",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,438
301466,ESET: Threat Report Q2 2020,2020,"A most discussed topic of the new decade, COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2. With an exceedingly high transmission rate, COVID-19 has affected almost all the countries in the world. Absent any vaccine or specific treatment, the humanity is left with nothing but the legacy method of quarantine. However, quarantine can only be effective when combined with early diagnosis of suspected cases. With their high sensitivity and unmatched specificity, biosensors have become an area of interest for development of novel diagnostic methods. Compared to the more traditional diagnostics, nanobiotechnology introduces biosensors as different diagnostics with greater versatility in application. Today, a growing number of analytes are being accurately identified by these nanoscopic sensing machines. Several reports of validated application with real samples further strengthen this idea. As of recent, there has been a rise in the number of studies on portable biosensors. Despite the slow progression, certain devices with embedded biosensors have managed to be of diagnostic value in several countries. The perceptible increase in development of mobile platforms has revolutionized the healthcare delivery system in the new millennium. The present article reviews the most recent advancements in development of diagnostic nanobiosensors and their application in the clinical fields. KEY POINTS: â¢ There is no specific treatment for highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2. â¢ Early diagnosis is critical for control of pandemic. â¢ Highly sensitive/specific nanobiosensors are emerging assets against COVID-19.","Sheervalilou, Roghayeh; Shirvaliloo, Milad; Sargazi, Saman; Shirvalilou, Sakine; Shahraki, Omolbanin; Pilehvar-Soltanahmadi, Younes; Sarhadi, Alireza; Nazarlou, Ziba; Ghaznavi, Habib; Khoei, Samideh",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,,438

DESIGN: Single-center retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Academic fertility center in an epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENT(S): All patients undergoing COS from June 17, 2019, to February 28, 2021. INTERVENTION(S): Universal COVID-19 screening starting June 17, 2020, with SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction testing within 5 days of oocyte retrieval, patient-reported symptom screening, and temperature monitoring. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURE(S): The primary outcome was the number of positive COVID-19 cases in patients undergoing COS cycles. The secondary outcomes were cycle outcomes compared with before COVID-19 COS cycles, adverse outcomes in COVID-canceled cycles, and center-specific COVID-19 detection rates compared with New York City cases. RESULT(S): From June 17, 2020, to February 28, 2021, 1,696 COS cycles were initiated with only seven positive COVID-19 cases for an overall positivity rate of 0.4%. When compared with before COVID cycles from June 17, 2019, to February 28, 2020, the volume of COS cycles were higher, while the overall cycle cancelation rate was lower during COVID-19. Cycle outcomes including oocyte yield and blast utilization rates were unchanged from pre-COVID cycles. Cases of COVID-19, while very low, occurred more frequently during surges in New York City rates. CONCLUSION(S): Assisted reproductive technology can be performed during the COVID-19 pandemic utilizing frequent universal screening and safe practices with low SARS-CoV-2 positivity, low cycle cancelation rates, and positive patient outcomes.","Shaw, Jacquelyn; Tozour, Jessica; Blakemore, Jennifer K; Grifo, James",Fertil. steril,,438

303787,An image-based eyelid lesion management service-evaluation of a pilot,2021,"N-Myc is a transcription factor that is aberrantly expressed in many tumor types and is often correlated with poor patient prognosis. Recently, several lines of evidence pointed to the fact that oncogenic activation of Myc family proteins is concomitant with reprogramming of tumor cells to cope with an enhanced need for metabolites during cell growth. These adaptions are driven by the ability of Myc proteins to act as transcriptional amplifiers in a tissue-of-origin specific manner. Here, we describe the effects of N-Myc overexpression on metabolic reprogramming in neuroblastoma cells. Ectopic expression of N-Myc induced a glycolytic switch that was concomitant with enhanced sensitivity towards 2-deoxyglucose, an inhibitor of glycolysis. Moreover, global metabolic profiling revealed extensive alterations in the cellular metabolome resulting from overexpression of N-Myc. Limited supply with either of the two main carbon sources, glucose or glutamine, resulted in distinct shifts in steady-state metabolite levels and significant changes in glutathione metabolism. Interestingly, interference with glutamine-glutamate conversion preferentially blocked proliferation of N-Myc overexpressing cells, when glutamine levels were reduced. Thus, our study uncovered N-Myc induction and nutrient levels as important metabolic master switches in neuroblastoma cells and identified critical nodes that restrict tumor cell proliferation.","Tjaden, Britta; Baum, Katharina; Marquardt, Viktoria; Simon, Mareike; Trajkovic-Arsic, Marija; Kouril, Theresa; Siebers, Bettina; Lisec, Jan; Siveke, Jens T; Schulte, Johannes H; Benary, Uwe; Remke, Marc; Wolf, Jana; Schramm, Alexander",Sci Rep,,438

Time delays between the continuum variations and the response of the broad optical emission lines were clearly detected, and we report reverberation measurements for H$\beta$, HeII $\lambda 4686$, H$\gamma$, and H$\delta$. From the time delay in the broad H$\beta$ emission line and the line width in the variable portion of the spectrum, we derive a black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH} = 2.34^{+0.43}_{-0.43} \times 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$. This is slightly smaller than, but consistent with, previous determinations. However, our significantly improved time sampling ($T_{\rm med}=1.7$ days compared to $T_{\rm med}=4.0$ days) has reduced the uncertainties on both the time delay and the derived mass by $\sim 50$%. We also detect clear velocity-resolved time delays across the broad H$\beta$ profile, with shorter lags in the line wings and a longer lag in the line core. Future modeling of the full velocity-resolved time delay response will further improve the reverberation-based mass for NGC 3783, adding it to the small but growing sample of AGNs for which we have direct, primary black hole mass measurements. Upcoming MUSE observations at VLT will also allow NGC 3783 to join the smaller sample of black holes where reverberation masses and masses from stellar dynamical modeling may be directly compared.","Bentz, Misty C.; Street, Rachel; Onken, Christopher A.; Valluri, Monica",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11358v1.pdf,438

A plethora of analyses based on viral sequences has already been published both in scientific journals and through non-peer-reviewed channels to investigate the genetic heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dissemination of SARS-CoV-2. However, a systematic investigation of phylogenetic information and sampling bias in the available data is lacking. Although the number of available genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 is growing daily and the sequences show increasing phylogenetic information, country-specific data still present severe limitations and should be interpreted with caution. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the quality of the currently available SARS-CoV-2 full genome data in terms of sampling bias as well as phylogenetic and temporal signals to inform and guide the scientific community. METHODS: We used maximum likelihood-based methods to assess the presence of sufficient information for robust phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies in several SARS-CoV-2 sequence alignments assembled from GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) data released between March and April 2020. RESULTS: Although the number of high-quality full genomes is growing daily, and sequence data released in April 2020 contain sufficient phylogenetic information to allow reliable inference of phylogenetic relationships, country-specific SARS-CoV-2 data sets still present severe limitations.

Hence, current reports should be interpreted with caution, and concerted efforts should continue to increase the number and quality of sequences required for robust tracing of the epidemic.","Mavian, Carla; Marini, Simone; Prosperi, Mattia; Salemi, Marco",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,438

316373,Recognition of Corona virus disease (COVID-19) using deep learning network,,"BACKGROUND: Melatonin (MT) is important for plant growth and development; however, it is not known whether MT is involved in apple adventitious root (AR) development. In this study, we treated Malus prunifolia (MP) at four different stages of AR development, and analyzed the level of the endogenous hormones MT, auxin (IAA), zeatin-riboside (ZR), abscisic acid (ABA), and gibberellins (GA1 + 3) in all four treatment groups and the untreated control group. The expression of MT, IAA biosynthesis, transport and signal transduction, the cell cycle, and root development related genes were quantified by RT-qPCR. The function of MdWOX11 was analyzed in transgenic apple plants. RESULTS: The promotion of AR development by MT was dependent on the stage of AR induction between 0 and 2 d in apple rootstocks. MT-treatment increased the level of IAA and crosstalk existed between MT and IAA during AR formation. The expression of MdWOX11 was induced by MT treatment and positively regulated AR formation in apple. Furthermore, transgenic lines that overexpressed MdWOX11 lines produced more ARs than 'GL3'. Phenotypic analysis indicated that MdWOX11 overexpression lines were more sensitive to exogenous MT treatment than 'GL3', suggesting that MdWOX11 regulates AR formation in response to MT in apple rootstock. CONCLUSIONS: MT promotes AR formation mainly during the AR induction stage by inducing IAA levels and upregulating MdWOX11.","Mao, Jiangping; Niu, Chundong; Li, Ke; Chen, Shiyue; Tahir, Muhammad Mobeen; Han, Mingyu; Zhang, Dong",BMC Plant Biol,,438

317270,Towards an Adaptive Software Architecture for Archetype-Based Healthcare Applications,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Umifenovir (Arbidol®) is an antiviral drug being used to treat influenza in Russia and China. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of umifenovir for COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in a non-intensive care unit (ICU) ward in Jinyintan Hospital from 2 February 2020 to 20 March 2020. COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of pharyngeal swab specimens. The confirmed patients were divided into the umifenovir group and the control group according to the use of umifenovir. The main outcomes were the rate of negative pharyngeal swab tests for SARS-CoV-2 within 1 week after admission and the time for the virus to turn negative. The negativity time of SARS-CoV-2 was defined as the first day of a negative test if the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 was negative for two consecutive tests. RESULTS: A total of 81 COVID-19 patients were included, with 45 in the umifenovir group and 36 in the control group. Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were comparable between the two groups. Thirty-three out of 45 (73%) patients in the umifenovir group tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 within 7 days after admission, the number was 28/36 (78%) in the control group (p 0.19). The median time from onset of symptoms to SARS-CoV-2 turning negative was 18 days (interquartile range (IQR) 12-21) in the umifenovir group and 16 days (IQR 11-21) in the control group (p 0.42). Patients in the umifenovir group had a longer hospital stay than patients in the control group (13 days (IQR 9-17) vs 11 days (IQR 9-14), p 0.04). No deaths or severe adverse reactions were found in both groups. DISCUSSION: Umifenovir might not improve the prognosis or accelerate SARS-CoV-2 clearance in non-ICU patients. A randomized control clinical trial is needed to assess the efficacy of umifenovir.","Lian, N; Xie, H; Lin, S; Huang, J; Zhao, J; Lin, Q",Clin Microbiol Infect,,438

METHODS: Two independent authors performed a systematic review of the Medline/PubMed, SCOPUS, COCHRANE, Lilacs and Web of Science electronic databases. The time of onset and duration of symptoms were considered primary outcomes. The sex and age of individuals, the geographical location of the study, the prevalence of symptoms, other associated symptoms, associated comorbidities, and the impact on quality of life and eating habits were considered secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Our search generated 17 articles. Many of the studies reported that the onset of anosmia and ageusia occurred 4 to 5 days after the manifestation of other symptoms of the infection and that these symptoms started to disappear after one week, with more significant improvements in the first two weeks. CONCLUSION: The present study concludes that the onset of symptoms of loss of smell and taste, associated with COVID-19, occurs 4 to 5 days after other symptoms, and that these symptoms last from 7 to 14 days. Findings, however, varied and there is therefore a need for further studies to clarify the occurrence of these symptoms. This would help to provide early diagnosis and reduce contagion by the virus.","Santos, Renata Emmanuele Assunção; da Silva, Maria Giselda; do Monte Silva, Maria Caroline Barbosa; Barbosa, Danielly Alves Mendes; Gomes, Ana Lisa do Vale; Galindo, Ligia Cristina Monteiro; da Silva Aragão, Raquel; Ferraz-Pereira, Kelli Nogueira",Am J Otolaryngol,,438

321349,Teaching Agile Software Development Using Agile Methods: A Case Study,2020,"Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) recently emerged and is responsible for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). Diagnostic tests have been developed, mainly based on reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Most RT-PCR assays target at least two SARS-CoV-2 genes. In some cases, only one target gene is detected;the interpretation of such cases remains unclear. Objectives Our objective was to analyse one target positive (OPT) RT-PCR results, using two RT-PCR assays: the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Cepheid diagnosis, “Cepheid”) and the Cobas® 6800 SARS-CoV-2 Test (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, “Roche”). Methods All SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results performed on respiratory samples with the Roche or the Cepheid tests, from 23rd March to 6th August 2020 were collected. A patient with an OPT result was classified as “probable COVID-19” if they met at least one of the three following criteria: (i) history of a two gene-positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result, (ii) anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody (IgG) detection or (iii) compatible chest computed tomography scan (CT-scan). Results A total of 18 630 and 1 189 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were performed with the Roche and Cepheid tests, respectively. Among the positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, 293 samples – corresponding to 264 patients – were OPT (11% of the positive samples). Of these patients, 180 (68%) had at least one of the three criteria listed above and were classified as probable COVID-19. Conclusions Sixty-eight percent of the patients with an OPT result were classified as probable COVID-19 and are probably at a late stage of infection. Serology and imaging can be helpful to confirm diagnosis.","Fenaux, Honorine Ghelfenstein-Ferreira Théo Salmona Maud Mahjoub Nadia Feghoul Linda Maylin Sarah Chaix Marie-Laure Minier Marine Gabassi Audrey Goff Jérôme Le Delaugerre Constance",Journal of Clinical Virology Plus,,438
321944,Logistics Flow Optimization for Advanced Management of the Crisis Situation,2020,"The 2019 novel Corona Virus pandemic beginning from Wuhan, China primarily affects the respiratory tract but its has impacted clinical practice across a range of specialities including neurology. We review the bearing of the 2019 NCoV infection on neurological practice. Neurological manifestations are less common than respiratory manifestations, yet conspicuous, affecting nearly over a third of hospitalized individuals. These may be classified in to early - headache, dizziness, hyposmia and hypogeusia and late - encephalopathy. Rarely but surely, a very small proportion of infected individuals might present with stroke. Certain neurological conditions, including cerebrovascular disease in both China and Italy and dementia in Italy predispose to infection and more severe manifestations, requiring intensive care unit admission. There is no convincing evidence that the manifestations, course and outcome of various neurological disorders is impacted by 2019 nCoV infection. Concerns of an increased risk of febrile seizures offset by a reduced frequency of infection in the paediatric age group. Individuals with multiple sclerosis might potentially experience both true and pseudorelapses. Besides a direct effect, 2019 nCoV has tremendously affected neurological care by disrupting the continuity of care and the availability of neurological medicines worldwide. Neurologists should respond to this challenge by developing and sustaining innovative methods of providing care as well as alerting the society at large to adopt measures to contain the spread of 2019 nCoV.","Mahajan, Nitika; Singla, Monika; Singh, Balveen; Sajja, Venkatesh; Bansal, Parth; Paul, Birinder; Goel, Parveen; Midha, Rahul; Bansal, Rajinder; Singh, Gagandeep",Ann.

Concerns have been raised that some deaths are being improperly attributed to COVID-19 (2). Analysis of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnoses on official death certificates might provide an expedient and efficient method to demonstrate whether reported COVID-19 deaths are being overestimated. CDC assessed documentation of diagnoses co-occurring with an ICD-10 code for COVID-19 (U07.1) on U.S. death certificates from 2020 that had been reported to CDC as of February 22, 2021. Among 378,048 death certificates listing U07.1, a total of 357,133 (94.5%) had at least one other ICD-10 code; 20,915 (5.5%) had only U07.1. Overall, 97.3% of 357,133 death certificates with at least one other diagnosis (91.9% of all 378,048 death certificates) were noted to have a co-occurring diagnosis that was a plausible chain-of-event condition (e.g., pneumonia or respiratory failure), a significant contributing condition (e.g., hypertension or diabetes), or both. Overall, 70%-80% of death certificates had both a chain-of-event condition and a significant contributing condition or a chain-of-event condition only; this was noted for adults aged 18-84 years, both males and females, persons of all races and ethnicities, those who died in inpatient and outpatient or emergency department settings, and those whose manner of death was listed as natural. These findings support the accuracy of COVID-19 mortality surveillance in the United States using official death certificates. High-quality documentation of co-occurring diagnoses on the death certificate is essential for a comprehensive and authoritative public record. Continued messaging and training (3) for professionals who complete death certificates remains important as the pandemic progresses. Accurate mortality surveillance is critical for understanding the impact of variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and of COVID-19 vaccination and for guiding public health action.","Gundlapalli, Adi V; Lavery, Amy M; Boehmer, Tegan K; Beach, Michael J; Walke, Henry T; Sutton, Paul D; Anderson, Robert N",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,438

The number of cases increased rapidly, and the virus spread continuously. Tens of thousands of medical staff throughout the country have since rushed to Wuhan to provide intensive medical treatment. Due to high levels of stress and work intensity, insufficient sleep and a lack of access to water after entering the isolation ward, staff may suffer from oral mucosal ulcers and other oral mucosal diseases. Police officers, community workers, family members in quarantine and even patients with mild coronavirus 2019, as well as those who have previously had oral mucosal disease, have also reported experiencing discomfort as a result of stress-induced oral mucosal disorders, such as recurrent aphthous ulcers, chronic cheilitis and oral lichen planus.

Articles reporting clinical evidence of therapeutic management of COVID-19 were selected from three different research databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science Direct). From the database search, 31 articles were selected based on the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. This review paper showed that remdesivir and ivermectin significantly reduced viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) activity. On the other hand, convalescent plasma (CP) significantly improved COVID-19 clinical symptoms. Additionally, the use of corticosteroid increased survival rates in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Findings also indicated that both hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir were effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, lopinavir-ritonavir combination was not effective against COVID-19. Finally, ribavirin, galidesivir, and sofosbuvir showed potential therapeutic benefit in treating COVID-19, but there is a lack of clinical evidence on their effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2.

We examined > 383,500 complete SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences in GISAID (Global Initiative of Sharing All Influenza Data) with sampling dates extending until April 05, 2021. These sequences originated from ten different countries: United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, United States, India, Russia, France, Spain, Germany, and China.

Despite lockdowns, worldwide active replication in genetically and socio-economically diverse populations facilitated selection of new mutations. The data on mutant and variant SARS-CoV-2 strains provided here comprise a global resource for easy access to the myriad mutations and variants detected to date globally.

329357,COVID-19 X-ray images classification based on enhanced fractional-order cuckoo search optimizer using heavy-tailed distributions,2020,"Frontline health care workers (HCWs) are experiencing a range of emotional responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including anxiety, traumatic stress, and burnout. As many as half of all HCWs will exhibit clinically significant distress. This distress may endure for years, and health care institutions must respond to these emotional needs. We propose the Matched Emotional Supports in Health Care (MESH) Framework to guide institutions in implementing a tiered, or ""stepped care"" model for deploying sustainable emotional support programs for HCWs for COVID-19 and beyond. Recognizing the variability in HCWs' response to stress, MESH outlines a continuum of services, including universal (e.g., self-help), selected (e.g., support from trained volunteers), and indicated (e.g., professional therapy, psychotropic medication management) interventions matched to individual need. We provide a targeted review of evidence-based resources available at each level of care and potential processes for determining when higher levels of care are needed. Finally, we delineate key implementation factors for institutions to consider in developing, implementing, and sustaining services for HCWs.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the factors associated with prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A literature search was conducted in several online databases. Fixed effects meta-analysis was performed for the factors associated with prevalence of VTE in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: A total of 39 studies were analyzed in this analysis. The incidence of pulmonary embolism and VTE in severe COVID-19 patients were 17% (95% CI, 13-21%) and 42% (95% CI, 25-60%), respectively. VTE were more common among individuals with COVID-19 of advance age. Male COVID-19 patients are more likely to experience VTE. Higher levels of white blood cell (WBC; WMD = 1.34×109/L; 95% CI, 0.84-1.84×109/L), D-dimer (WMD = 4.21 ug/mL; 95% CI, 3.77-4.66 ug/mL), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT; WMD = 2.03 s; 95% CI, 0.83-3.24 s), fibrinogen (WMD = 0.49 ug/mL; 95% CI, 0.18-0.79 g/L) and C-reactive protein (CRP; WMD = 21.89 mg/L; 95% CI, 11.44-32.34 mg/L) were commonly noted in COVID-19 patients with VTE. Patients with lower level of lymphocyte (WMD = -0.15×109/L; 95% CI, -0.23-0.07×109/L) was at high risk of developing VTE. The incidence of severe condition (OR = 2.66; 95% CI, 1.95-3.62) was more likely to occur among COVID-19 patients who developed VTE. CONCLUSION: VTE is a common complication in severe COVID-19 patients and thromboembolic events are also associated with adverse outcomes.","Wu, Ting; Zuo, Zhihong; Yang, Deyi; Luo, Xuan; Jiang, Liping; Xia, Zanxian; Xiao, Xiaojuan; Liu, Jing; Ye, Mao; Deng, Meichun",Age ageing,,438

Given the shockingly high rates of infections and deaths in nursing homes, staying in the community appears to be a good option for older adults in this crisis, but in order for some older adults to do so much assistance is required. This situation draws attention to the need for benevolent intervention on the part of the state should older adults become ill or lose their sources of income and support during the crisis. This essay provides a brief overview of public support and the financial and health benefits for older individuals who remain in the community during the pandemic. It reports the case example of Austin, Texas, a city with a rapidly aging and diverse population of almost a million residents, to ask how we can assess the success of municipalities in responding to the changing needs of older adults in the community due to COVID-19. It concludes with a discussion of what governmental and non-governmental leadership can accomplish in situations such as that brought about by the current crisis.","Angel, Jacqueline L; Mudrazija, Stipica",J Aging Soc Policy,,438

Such measures usually involve restrictions on the movement of citizens, and have had a profound effect on usual activities and timetables. As a result of school closures and strict restrictions regarding going outside home, children have been one of the most disadvantaged population groups during the lockdown period. We therefore aimed to investigate potential health risk behaviors amongst isolated pre-school and school-aged children. We retrieved relevant articles from MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and Scopus databases to describe identified health-related behaviors (i.e. screen exposure, environmental influence, physical activity and fitness, sedentariness, sleep patterns, eating habits, psychological response, body composition, and injuries) in relation to social isolation and social deprivation of children without previous illness or conditions. This review depicts the potential health-related behaviors according to related literature, and put the focus on future short and long-term sequels of social isolation. Socio-affective complications and insufficient physical activity are underscored as two of the main concerns, particularly among socio-economic deprived children. Both issues could be effectively addressed with either adequate parental or community guidance.","López-Bueno, Rubén; López-Sánchez, Guillermo F; Casajús, José A; Calatayud, Joaquín; Tully, Mark A; Smith, Lee",Prev Med,,438

335108,Big Data Analytics in Humanitarian and Disaster Operations: A Systematic Review,2021-08-22,"The COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing lockdown of many US States resulted in rapid changes to motor vehicle traffic and their associated emissions. This presents a challenge for air quality modelling and forecasting during this period, in that transportation emission inventories need to be updated in near real-time. Here, we update the previously developed fuel-based inventory of vehicle emissions (FIVE) to account for changes due to COVID-19 lockdowns. We first construct a 2020 business-as-usual (BAU) case inventory and adjust the emissions for a COVID-19 case using monthly fuel sales information. We evaluate cellular phone-based mobility data products (Google COVID-19 Community Mobility, Apple COVID-19 Mobility Trends) in comparison to embedded traffic monitoring sites in four US cities. We find that mobility datasets tend to overestimate traffic reductions in April 2020 (i.e. lockdown period), while fuel sales adjustments are more similar to changes observed by traffic monitors;for example, mobility-based methods for scaling emissions result in an approximately two-times greater estimate of on-road nitrogen oxide (NO x ) reductions in April 2020 than we find using a fuel-based method. Overall, FIVE estimates a 20%–25% reduction in mobile source NO x emissions in April 2020 versus BAU, and a smaller 6%–7% drop by July. Reductions in April showed considerable spatial heterogeneity, ranging from 6% to 39% at the state level. Similar decreases are found for carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organic compounds. Decreases to mobile source NO x emissions are expected to lower total US anthropogenic emissions by 9%–12% and 3%–4% in April and July, respectively, with larger relative impacts in urban areas. Changes to diurnal and day-of-week patterns of light- and heavy-duty vehicular traffic are evaluated and found to be relatively minor. Beyond the applicability to modelling air quality in 2020, this work also represents a methodology for quickly updating US transportation inventories and for calibrating mobility-based estimates of emissions.","Harkins, Colin McDonald Brian C.; Henze, Daven K.; Wiedinmyer, Christine",Environmental Research Letters,,438
335132,An integrated planning framework for sustainable water and energy supply,2020,"BACKGROUND: As outbreak of COVID-19 infection, on April 03, 2020, it is stipulated that the number of inpatient companions is limited to one in Taiwan. All companions are required to register their real personal data with 14 days of travel history, occupation, contact history and cluster history. We would like to evaluate the impact of the new regulations to the accompanying and visiting culture in Taiwan, via analyzing the appearance and characteristics of inpatients companions in this period. METHODS: Using intelligent technology, we designed a novel system in managing the inpatients companions (InPatients Companions Management System, IPCMS), and the IPCMS was used to collect data about characteristics of inpatients and companions between April 27 and May 3, 2020. The database is built using MySQL software. Microsoft Excel 2016 and SPSS version 20.0 statistical software were used for data analysis, including the basic data of the companions, differential analysis of companians' gender, person-days and cumulative time, differential analysis of accompaniment-patient relationship, and frequency of accompaniment and cumulative hours. RESULTS: During study period, daily inpatient admissions ranged from 2242-2514, the number of companions per day ranged from 2048-2293, and the number of companions for one inpatient is 1-9 per day, with an average of 1.20-1.26. The companions were mostly family members, and most of them were the inpatients' children (32.9%), and spouse (26.13%). More females than males were noted in all categories of companionship with statistical significance. CONCLUSION: The data got in this study could be an important basis for the transformation and reform of the companions culture in Taiwan's hospitals, and will also provide a glimpse into the attitudes and culture of companions who have long been ignorant and neglected. The experience gained in our IPCMS could also serve as a reference for other hospitals in Taiwan and worldwide.","Hung, Shih-Hsin; Kuo, Shu-Chen; Fen, Jun-Jeng; Tseng, Kuan-Jui; Sun, Ying-Chou; Ming, Jin-Lain",J.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample consisted of 30 patients with overdentures, who were selected from the dental records filed at the institution. Data on general health and the dental implants involved (brand, type of prosthetic connection, number of implants, and additional overdenture retention system) were collected from the medical records. The 30 patients were invited to answer the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) and visual analog scale (VAS) questionnaires, and due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, it was possible to contact 15 patients. RESULTS: Most of the prostheses studied were mandibular overdentures, and 66.66% of the cases were retained by the O-ring system. As for the oral health self-perception of the individuals, it was concluded that male patients had a lower mean overall score (p = 0.047) and functional domain (p = 0.042) in the OHIP-14. The number of implants and the installation arch interfered with functional domain and psychological capacity (p <0.05). The VAS showed that women have greater esthetic satisfaction with prostheses (p = 0.048) and that the bar-clip retention system is more satisfactory than the O-ring (p = 0.017). CONCLUSION: Despite the limitations of overdentures, it was noted that, when properly indicated, they are a viable option for oral rehabilitation on implants. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Oral rehabilitation well-indicated with overdentures, especially those retained by the bar-clip system, results in an improvement in the patients' quality of life.","Dillenburg, C.; Dogenski, L.

Our study aimed to determine these effects in the city of Tehran by comparing the ambient PM 2.5and PM 10levels recorded at 22 air quality monitoring stations during the outbreak (20 February–2 April 2020) with those from the corresponding period last year (20 February–3 April 2019). Contrary to expectation, the average concentrations of both the PM 2.5and the PM 10were markedly higher during the former, increasing by 20.5% and 15.7%, respectively, for the first month of the outbreak (20 February–19 March 2020) and by 23.5% and 20.0% for the subsequent Nowruz New Year holidays (from late March till early April), which resulted in overall increases of 20.5% and 16.5% for the entire period. The non-integrated responses to the pandemic, including the failure to close administrative centers and, in particular, the recommendation to maintain social distancing by reducing public transportation use (prompting citizens to travel by private vehicle), have worsened the ambient air quality in Tehran, providing an exceptional opportunity to evaluate the direct/indirect influence of air quality policies and emission control measures on PM 2.5and PM 10. Because of the significant association between the lethality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and exposure to ambient air pollution, the rise in airborne PM 2.5during this outbreak may increase the mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2.","Faridi, Sasan; Yousefian, Fatemeh; Niazi, Sadegh; Ghalhari, Mohammad Rezvani; Hassanvand, Mohammad Sadegh; Naddafi, Kazem",Aerosol Air Qual.

This study compares relevant standards on high-frequent Chinese Materia Medicia (CMM) used in this pandemic aiming at reaching a global consensus and ensuring the use of Chinese medicines safely. METHODS: 141 representative Chinese formulas and Chinese Patent Medicines from the National Protocol and the most of Provincial Protocols for controlling COVID-19 in China have been collected to statistical analyze the composition and characteristics of CMM. Among them, the domestic and international standards of 47 varieties with the frequency usage over 10 times were selected to compare their quality requirements in the mainstream pharmacopoeias and international standards. RESULTS: The quality requirements of used CMM for fighting COVID-19 on the terms of overall quality control, marker compounds, and safety indicators showed different patterns in these mainstream pharmacopoeias and international standards. The uniformed and scientific quality standards of CMM were urgently needed to promote global acceptation and trade. CONCLUSIONS: These findings will provide evidence for building unified quality and safety standards that can adapt to the characteristics of CMM and promote international trade, and also will be stated that it is of the highest priority for ISO/TC 249 to formulate high-quality standards that consolidate international consensus to ensure quality and safety of the urgently needed CMM.","Shi, Yan-Hong; Huang, Yu-Feng; Wang, Wang-Ying; Yang, Li; Zhou, Hua; Sang, Zhen",Pharmacol Res,,438

To reduce bandwidth consumption, tile-based streaming has been proposed to deliver the focused part of the video, instead of the whole one. On the other hand, the techniques to alleviate cybersickness, which is akin to motion sickness and happens when using digital displays, have not been jointly explored with the tile selection in VR. In this paper, we investigate Tile Selection with Cybersickness Control (TSCC) in an adaptive 360{\deg} video streaming system with cybersickness alleviation. We propose an m-competitive online algorithm with Cybersickness Indicator (CI) and Video Loss Indicator (VLI) to evaluate instant cybersickness and the total loss of video quality. Moreover, the algorithm exploits Sickness Migration Indicator (SMI) to evaluate the cybersickness accumulated over time and the increase of optical flow to improve the tile quality assignment. Simulations with a real network dataset show that our algorithm outperforms the baselines regarding video quality and cybersickness accumulation.","Lin, Chiao-Wen; Wang, Chih-Hang; Yang, De-Nian; Liao, Wanjiun",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.01252v1.pdf,438

But information can also induce distress. We ask whether the mode of information delivery affects mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic. We randomized Indian migrant workers to receive Covid-19-related information through text messages, a pre-recorded audio message, or live phone calls. Phone calls increased knowledge among individuals without smartphones and reduced depression and anxiety overall. The amount of information delivered explains gains in knowledge but not improvements in mental health. Governments should consider broadcasts through live phone calls given their mental health benefits.","Sadish, D.; Adhvaryu, Achyuta Nyshadham Anant",Journal of Development Economics,,438

Recent studies have shown that there is an excess risk of contracting the infection, as well as developing severe symptoms and worst outcomes for some of these conditions. We present a single center experience of the characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted due to with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and chronic lung disease. Methods: Retrospective medical records review of patients with chronic lung conditions (COPD, asthma, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, and lung cancer) and SARS-CoV-2 infection between January 1, 2020 and December 1, 2020 at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA. Patients were identified from our institutional database. Demographics, baseline comorbidities, hospital say, ICU admission, and interventions performed were recorded. Results: 12.405 patients were diagnosed with SARS CoV-2 infection at BIDMC. From the total, 961 (7.8%) patients were admitted for further care with an age of 66 years (IQR 52-78), 464 (48.28%) males, and a BMI of 29.8 kg/m2 (IQR 25.8-34.6). Regarding the comorbid conditions, 157 subjects (16.3%) had COPD, 157 (16.3%) asthma, 24 (2.50%) pulmonary hypertension, 14 (1.46%) ILD and 18 (1.87%) lung cancer. We found that patients with COPD (23.57% vs 14.68%, p=0.005) as well as lung cancer (38.89% vs 15.69%, p=0.016) died more often after hospital admission. Additionally, a logistic regression model for mortality showed an OR of 1.8 (95%CI 1.2-2.7, p=0.006) for COPD and an OR of 3.42 (95%CI 1.30-8.96, p=90.012) for lung cancer. Conclusion: Our review showed that patients hospitalized due to SARS CoV-2 infection, and a previous diagnosis of COPD or lung cancer, were more likely to die during the hospital stay.

341065,COVID-19 Insightful Data Visualization and Forecasting Using Elasticsearch,2021,"BACKGROUND: Circulating APOL1 lyses trypanosomes, protecting against human sleeping sickness. Two common African gene variants of APOL1, G1 and G2, protect against infection by species of trypanosomes that resist wild-type APOL1. At the same time, the protection predisposes humans to CKD, an elegant example of balanced polymorphism. However, the exact mechanism of APOL1-mediated podocyte damage is not clear, including APOL1's subcellular localization, topology, and whether the damage is related to trypanolysis. METHODS: APOL1 topology in serum (HDL particles) and in kidney podocytes was mapped with flow cytometry, immunoprecipitation, and trypanolysis assays that tracked 170 APOL1 domain-specific monoclonal antibodies. APOL1 knockout podocytes confirmed antibody specificity. RESULTS: APOL1 localizes to the surface of podocytes, with most of the pore-forming domain (PFD) and C terminus of the Serum Resistance Associated-interacting domain (SRA-ID), but not the membrane-addressing domain (MAD), being exposed. In contrast, differential trypanolytic blocking activity reveals that the MAD is exposed in serum APOL1, with less of the PFD accessible. Low pH did not detectably alter the gross topology of APOL1, as determined by antibody accessibility, in serum or on podocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Our antibodies highlighted different conformations of native APOL1 topology in serum (HDL particles) and at the podocyte surface. Our findings support the surface ion channel model for APOL1 risk variant-mediated podocyte injury, as well as providing domain accessibility information for designing APOL1-targeted therapeutics.","Gupta, Nidhi; Wang, Xinhua; Wen, Xiaohui; Moran, Paul; Paluch, Maciej; Hass, Philip E; Heidersbach, Amy; Haley, Benjamin; Kirchhofer, Daniel; Brezski, Randall J; Peterson, Andrew S; Scales, Suzie J",J.

342873,From 5Vs to 6Cs: Operationalizing Epidemic Data Management with COVID-19 Surveillance,2020,"Revealing the changes in chemical compositions and sources of PM2.5 is important for understanding aerosol chemistry and emission control strategies. High time-resolved characterization of water-soluble inorganic ions, elements, organic carbon (OC), and elemental carbon (EC) in PM2.5 was conducted in a coastal city of southeast China during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed that the average concentration of PM2.5 during the city lockdown (CLD) decreased from 46.2 μg m−3 to 24.4 μg m−3, lower than the same period in 2019 (PM2.5: 37.1 μg m−3). Concentrations of other air pollutants, such as SO2, NO2, PM10, OC, EC, and BC, were also decreased by 27.3%–67.8% during the CLD, whereas O3 increased by 28.1%. Although SO2 decreased from 4.94 μg m−3to 1.59 μg m−3 during the CLD, the concentration of SO42− (6.63 μg m−3) was comparable to that (5.47 μg m−3) during the non-lockdown period, which were attributed to the increase (16.0%) of sulfate oxidation rate (SOR). Ox (O3+NO2) was positively correlated with SO42−, suggesting the impacts of photochemical oxidation. A good correlation (R2 = 0.557) of SO42− and Fe and Mn was found, indicating the transition-metal ion catalyzed oxidation. Based on positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis, the contribution of secondary formation to PM2.5 increased during the epidemic period, consisting with the increase of secondary organic carbon (SOC), while other primary sources including traffic, dust, and industry significantly decreased by 9%, 8.5%, and 8%, respectively. This study highlighted the comprehensive and nonlinear response of chemical compositions and formation mechanisms of PM2.5 to anthropogenic emissions control under relatively clean conditions.","Hong, Y.; Xu, X.; Liao, D.; Zheng, R.; Ji, X.; Chen, Y.; Xu, L.; Li, M.; Wang, H.; Xiao, H.; Choi, S.

Based on compelling evidence that patients with cancer are at increased risk for greater morbidity and mortality with COVID-19, several professional organizations have provided early guidance on the role of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with malignant disease. In this commentary we review the available data on the efficacy and safety of the approved and forthcoming vaccines in patients with cancer. Based on a review of the totality of available evidence, we recommend that most patients with cancer should receive the recommended dose and schedule of one of the COVID-19 vaccines when available. We encourage industry, regulators and professional research organizations to carefully track the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with cancer in the real world setting and routinely report unanticipated adverse events and signs of loss of efficacy. Particular attention is needed for patients on active cancer therapy to carefully evaluate efficacy and safety in relationship to the timing of vaccination relative to that of active cancer treatment and immunosuppression.","Kuderer, Nicole M; Hill, Joshua A; Carpenter, Paul A; Lyman, Gary H",Cancer Invest,,438

Using mobile device location data of over 100 million monthly active samples, we compute origin-destination travel demand and aggregate mobility inflow at each US county from March 1 to June 9, 2020. Then, we quantify the change of mobility inflow across the nation and statistically model the time-varying relationship between inflow and the infections. We find that external travel to other counties decreased by 35% soon after the nation entered the emergency situation, but recovered rapidly during the partial reopening phase. Moreover, our simultaneous equations analysis highlights the dynamics in a positive relationship between mobility inflow and the number of infections during the COVID-19 onset. This relationship is found to be increasingly stronger in partially reopened regions. Our study provides a quick reference and timely data availability for researchers and decision makers to understand the national mobility trends before and during the pandemic. The modeling results can be used to predict mobility and transmissions risks and integrated with epidemics models to further assess the public health outcomes.","Xiong, Chenfeng; Hu, Songhua; Yang, Mofeng; Luo, Weiyu; Zhang, Lei",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,438

Blood transfusion plays an important role in the success of KT. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is also used for desensitisation in ABO-incompatible KT and treatment of antibody-mediated rejection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed red blood cell (RBC), platelet, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) usage and the number of TPE procedures performed during the hospitalisation of KT patients from 2002 to 2017 using the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Health Information Database. RESULTS: A total of 18,331 KT patients were included in this study. The number of transfused RBCs continued to increase from 4,806 units in 2002-2005 to 12,390 units in 2014-2017. However, the average number of RBCs transfused per patient decreased from 2.17 to 1.79 units. Estimated platelet usage increased from 4,259 units in 2002-2005 to 11,519 units in 2014-2017, and the proportion of filtered platelets increased from 72.6% to 83.4% during the same period. There was a huge increase in the total number of FFP units used, from 2,255 units in 2002-2005 to 51,531 units in 2014-2017. The number of TPE procedures performed also increased from 296 to 6,479 during the same period. Patients with acute rejection accounted for 8.8% of all KT patients, and more RBC and FFP were used for these patients and a greater number of TPE procedures were performed compared to those who did not experience rejection. DISCUSSION: Blood usage and TPE have increased steadily with the increasing numbers of KTs. Therefore, continuous efforts are needed to ensure appropriate perioperative blood preparation and usage for KT patients.","Kim, Banseok; Kang, Minjin; Lee, Jae Kwang; Lee, Hyung Soon; Park, Yongjung",,,438

To address these uncertainties, this narrative review evaluates human evidence on how altered maternal thyroid function may be associated with child neurodevelopmental outcomes; and seeks to identify parameters in human studies that appear most relevant for toxicological assessments. Serum levels of free thyroxine (fT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) are most frequently measured when assessing thyroid function in pregnant women, whereas a broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental parameters is used to evaluate child neurodevelopment. The human data confirms an association between altered maternal serum fT4 and/or TSH and increased risk for child neurodevelopmental impairment. Quantitative boundaries of effects indicative of increased risks need to be established. Moreover, it is unknown if altered serum levels of total T4, free or total triiodothyronine, or parameters unrelated to serum thyroid hormones might be more relevant indicators of such effects.

While most patients infected with the COVID-19 virus have no to moderate symptoms, there is currently limited clinical information about these patients. Methods: In this study, we retrospectively investigated 41 patients infected with the COVID-19 virus in Nanchang, Jiangxi province, China, from February 4 to March 2, 2020. Nanchang is about 260 km southeast of Wuhan, the initial epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. We retrieved information on patient demographics, physical examination results, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, underlying conditions, laboratory analyses, radiological images, and treatment outcomes. Results: Most patients (70.7%) had a history of close contact with patients with confirmed COVID-19, and 16 patients (39.0%) showed a high degree of family clustering. All 41 patients had no to moderate symptoms. The median age was 39.9 years and common symptoms of illness were fever (69.2%), cough (65.4%), and fatigue (19.2%). The dominant patient group was middle-aged women, with hypertension (14.6%) and chronic liver disease (12.2%) as the most frequent underlying conditions. All patients recovered, with the mean time of viral nucleic acid clearance at 10.6 days. Chest CT scans presented ground-glass opacities in 53.7% of patients while 26.8% had normal CT images. Laboratory results showed that lymphocyte counts, lymphocyte percentages, ESR, CRP, IgG, Fib, and cytokines were correlated to patients' conditions. Approximately 60-90% of patients had abnormally high levels of cytokines IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and/or TNF-&#945;. Conclusions: Our results showed variable clinical and laboratory presentations among this group of patients infected with the COVID-19 virus. Though all 41 patients recovered, our results suggest that cytokine levels and other biochemical indicators should be monitored for patients infected with the COVID-19 virus showing no to moderate symptoms to ensure quick access for critical medical attention, if needed.","Hong, Jian-Ming; Hu, Long-Hua; Zhong, Qiao-Shi; Zhu, Long-Chuan; Hang, Ya-Ping; Fang, Xue-Yao; Sun, Hua-Bao; Huang, Zhi-Hua; Xu, Jianping; Chen, Yan-Hui",Front Med (Lausanne),,438

Diagnosis of COVID-19 depends on quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), which is time-consuming and requires expensive instrumentation. Here, we report an ultrasensitive electrochemical biosensor based on isothermal rolling circle amplification (RCA) for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. The assay involves the hybridization of the RCA amplicons with probes that were functionalized with redox active labels that are detectable by an electrochemical biosensor. The one-step sandwich hybridization assay could detect as low as 1 copy/µL of N and S genes, in less than 2 h. Sensor evaluation with 106 clinical samples, including 41 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 9 samples positive for other respiratory viruses, gave a 100% concordance result with qRT-PCR, with complete correlation between the biosensor current signals and quantitation cycle (Cq) values.

However, the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has received unprecedented attention internationally. Monitoring pathogenic CoVs in environmental compartments has been proposed as a promising strategy in preventing the environmental spread and tracing of infectious diseases, but a lack of reliable and efficient detection techniques is still a significant challenge. Moreover, the lack of information regarding the monitoring methodology may pose a barrier to primary researchers. Here, we provide a systematic introduction focused on the detection of CoVs in various environmental matrices, comprehensively involving methods and techniques of sampling, pretreatment, and analysis. Furthermore, the review addresses the challenges and potential improvements in virus detection techniques for environmental surveillance.","Yao, Linlin; Zhu, Wenting; Shi, Jianbo; Xu, Tailin; Qu, Guangbo; Zhou, Wenhua; Yu, Xue-Feng; Zhang, Xueji; Jiang, Guibin",Chem Soc Rev,,438

The goal of our study was to test a new 10-plex electro-chemiluminescence-based assay to measure IgM and IgG responses to the spike proteins from multiple human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, assess the epitope specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response against full-length spike protein, receptor-binding domain and N-terminal domain of the spike protein, and the nucleocapsid protein. We carried out the assay on samples collected from three sample groups: subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 from the U.S. Army hospital at Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, South Korea; healthcare administrators from the same hospital but with no reported diagnosis of COVID-19; and pre-pandemic samples. We found that the new CoV-specific multiplex assay was highly sensitive allowing plasma samples to be diluted 1:30,000 with a robust signal. The reactivity of IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could distinguish COVID-19 samples from non-COVID-19 and pre-pandemic samples. The data from the three sample groups also revealed a unique pattern of cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and seasonal coronaviruses HKU1 and OC43. Our findings show that the CoV-2 IgM response is highly specific while the CoV-2 IgG response is more cross-reactive across a range of human CoVs and also showed that IgM and IgG responses show distinct patterns of epitope specificity. In summary, this multiplex assay was able to distinguish samples by COVID-19 status and characterize distinct trends in terms of cross-reactivity and fine-specificity in antibody responses, underscoring its potential value in diagnostic or serosurveillance efforts.","Chaudhury, Sidhartha; Hutter, Jack; Bolton, Jessica S; Hakre, Shilpa; Mose, Evelyn; Wooten, Amy; O039,; Connell, William; Hudak, Joseph; Krebs, Shelly J; Darden, Janice M; Regules, Jason A; Murray, Clinton K; Modjarrad, Kayvon; Scott, Paul; Peel, Sheila; Bergmann-Leitner, Elke S",PLoS One,,438

In doing so, I summarize the evidence of racial/ethnic disparities in child well-being after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent findings demonstrate that, compared to white children, black and Latino children are more likely to have experienced poverty and food insufficiency, to have had parents lose their jobs, and to be exposed to distance learning and school closures during the pandemic. I argue that though COVID-19 has indeed worsened racial/ethnic disparities in child well-being, it has also served to place a spotlight on the American welfare state's historical mistreatment of low-income families and black and Latino families in particular. Consider that around three-fourths of black and Latino children facing food insufficiency during the pandemic also experienced food insufficiency prior to the onset of the pandemic. Moving forward, analyses of racial/ethnic disparities in child well-being during the pandemic, I argue, must not only consider the economic shock and high unemployment rates of 2020, but the failure of the American welfare state to adequately support jobless parents, and black and Latino parents in particular, long before the COVID-19 pandemic arrived.","Parolin, Zachary",Race Soc Probl,,438

369017,Circular Economy and Relationship-Based View *,2020,"Rationale: Evidence linking outdoor air pollution with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) incidence and mortality is largely based on ecological comparisons between regions that may differ in factors such as access to testing and control measures that may not be independent of air pollution concentrations. Moreover, studies have yet to focus on key mechanisms of air pollution toxicity such as oxidative stress. Objectives: To conduct a within-city analysis of spatial variations in COVID-19 incidence and the estimated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in lung lining fluid attributable to fine particulate matter (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter â©½2.5 µm [PM2.5]). Methods: Sporadic and outbreak-related COVID-19 case counts, testing data, population data, and sociodemographic data for 140 neighborhoods were obtained from the City of Toronto. ROS estimates were based on a mathematical model of ROS generation in lung lining fluid in response to iron and copper in PM2.5. Spatial variations in long-term average ROS were predicted using a land-use regression model derived from measurements of iron and copper in PM2.5. Data were analyzed using negative binomial regression models adjusting for covariates identified using a directed acyclic graph and accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Measurements and Main Results: A significant positive association was observed between neighborhood-level ROS and COVID-19 incidence (incidence rate ratio = 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.15 per interquartile range ROS). Effect modification by neighborhood-level measures of racialized group membership and socioeconomic status was also identified. Conclusions: Examination of neighborhood characteristics associated with COVID-19 incidence can identify inequalities and generate hypotheses for future studies.","Stieb, David M; Evans, Greg J; To, Teresa M; Lakey, Pascale S J; Shiraiwa, Manabu; Hatzopoulou, Marianne; Minet, Laura; Brook, Jeffrey R; Burnett, Richard T; Weichenthal, Scott A",Am J Respir Crit Care Med,,438

METHODS: In total, 362 plasma samples (108 with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]-positive pharyngeal swabs, 111 negative controls, and 143 with positive serology without confirmation by RT-PCR) were tested with quantitative assays (Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [EI-S1-IgG-quant]) and Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S [Ro-RBD-Ig-quant]), which were compared with each other and confirmatory tests, including wild-type virus micro-neutralization (NT) and GenScript®cPass&#8482;. Square roots R of coefficients of determination were calculated for continuous variables and non-parametric tests were used for paired comparisons. RESULTS: Quantitative anti-S1 serology correlated well with each other (true positives, 96%; true negatives, 97%). Antibody titers decreased over time (< 30 to > 240 days after initial positive RT-PCR). Agreement with GenScript-cPass was 96%/99% for true positives and true negatives, respectively, for Ro-RBD-Ig-quant and 93%/97% for EI-S1-IgG-quant. Ro-RBD-Ig-quant allowed distinct separation between positives and negatives, and less non-specific reactivity versus EI-S1-IgG-quant. Raw values (95% CI) &#8805; 28.7 U/mL (22.6-36.4) for Ro-RBD-Ig-quant and &#8805; 49.8 U/mL (43.4-57.1) for EI-S1-IgG-quant predicted NT > 1:5 in 95% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest both quantitative anti-S1 assays (EI-S1-IgG-quant and Ro-RBD-Ig-quant) may replace direct neutralization assays in quantitative measurement of immune protection against SARS-CoV-2 in certain circumstances. However, although the mean antibody titers for both assays tended to decrease over time, a higher proportion of Ro-RBD-Ig-quant values remained positive after 240 days.","Rubio-Acero, Raquel; Castelletti, Noemi; Fingerle, Volker; Olbrich, Laura; Bakuli, Abhishek; Wölfel, Roman; Girl, Philipp; Müller, Katharina; Jochum, Simon; Strobl, Matthias; Hoelscher, Michael; Wieser, Andreas",Infect Dis Ther,,438

Participants were 907 Polish people (522 women and 385 men). We used the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FOC-6), Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-29) and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. The relationship between stress and life satisfaction was mediated by the sense of coherence, and the relationship between stress and sense of coherence was moderated by fear of COVID-19. The fear of COVID-19 acted as a buffer in the relationship between stress and sense of coherence weakening the impact of stress on the sense of coherence. This study is the first to verify the proposed model of moderated mediation during the COVID-19 pandemic and was undertaken in a very large sample. This manuscript highlights the important role of the fear of COVID-19 and sense of coherence in our well-being. An individual's sense of coherence can affect their subjective well-being and help them to effectively manage stress and reduce anxiety.","Dymecka, Joanna; Gerymski, Rafal; Machnik-Czerwik, Anna",Psychol Health Med,,438

Serology testing seems to have a higher sensitivity than molecular diagnostics from 8 days after onset of symtoms, and should be part of risk assessment and epidemiological studies of COVID-19. The performance of commercial serological point-of-care (POC) lateral flow tests are highly manufacturer-dependant. Low sensitivity increases the risk of false negative results and could result in unnecessary quarantine of test persons with developed antibodies. Low specificity increases the risk of false positive results and could lead to false assumptions of immunity. Carefully selected serological POC tests for sars-cov-2 can be used in large scale testing but should only be used by licensed medical staff able to understand their limitations and interpret the results.","Stackelberg, Otto; Esmaeilzadeh, Mouna; Olsen, Björn; Lundkvist, Åke",Lakartidningen,,438

We aimed at verifying the level of bronchodilator reversibility in COVID-19 patients undergoing multidisciplinary pulmonary rehabilitation after the acute phase. METHODS: We enrolled 105 consecutive patients referring to the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Unit of Istituti Clinici Scientifici Maugeri Spa SB, IRCCS of Telese Terme, Benevento, Italy after being discharged from the COVID-19 acute care ward and after recovering from acute COVID-19 pneumonia. All subjects performed a spirometry before and after inhalation of salbutamol 400 µg to determine the bronchodilation response within 48 h of admission to the unit. RESULTS: All patients had suffered from a moderate to severe COVID-19, classified 3 or 4 according to the WHO classification, Seventeen patients had concomitant obstructive lung disease (14 suffering from COPD and 3 from asthma). FEV1 after salbutamol improved on average by 41.7 mL in the entire examined sample, by 29.4 mL in subjects without concomitant obstructive lung diseases, by 59.3 mL in COPD patients and by 320.0 mL in asthma patients.

Due to the similarities between the symptoms of influenza and COVID-19, receiving the flu vaccine in suspicious cases can be helpful because it will make it easier to request a medical test and diagnosis. In this study, the value of influenza vaccination in the cancer population was investigated. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, all cancer patients who were referred to our clinic and had eligibility to receive the flu vaccine were included in our study for following up clinical signs every week for one month. All patients who were vaccinated from October 1 to November 15, 2020 were investigated. The most side effects that were followed were fever, runny nose, bone pain, and life-threatening or persistent adverse effects. RESULTS: From a total of 288 patients (median age: 52 years (range 18-79), 112 (38.9%) males and 176 (61.1%) female) with different types of cancers, only two patients had an adverse effect of vaccination (including bone pain, runny nose, and fatigue), and one had COVID-19 ten days after vaccination. The rest of the patients did not show any side effects due to flu vaccination after one month of follow-up. Cancer patients are recommended to receive the flu vaccine annually during the pandemic and after the end of this pandemic, usually during the flu epidemic season to reduce mortality.","Aznab, Mozaffar; Eskandari Roozbahani, Narges; Moazen, Homa",Support. care cancer,,438

372382,Feeling the Service Product Closer: Triggering Visit Intention via Virtual Reality,2020,"In a pandemic contact between humans needs to be avoided wherever possible. Robots can take over an increasing number of tasks to protect people from being exposed to others. One such task is the disinfection of environments in which infection spread is particularly likely or bears increased risks. It has been shown that UVC light is effective in neutralizing a variety of pathogens, among others the virus causing COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. Another function which can reduce the need for physical proximity between humans is interaction via telepresence, i.e., the remote embodiment of a person controlling the robot. This work presents a modular mobile robot for telepresence and disinfection with UVC lamps. Both operation modes are supported by adaptable autonomy navigation features for facilitating efficient task execution. The platform's primary contributions are its hardware and software design, which combine consumer-grade components and 3D-printed mounting with open-source software frameworks.","Potenza, Andre; Kiselev, Andrey; Saffiotti, Alessandro; Loutfi, Amy",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01551v1.pdf,438

The IMPROVE-DD VTE risk assessment model (RAM) has previously demonstrated good discrimination in non-COVID populations. We aimed to externally validate the IMPROVE-DD VTE RAM in medical patients hospitalized with COVID-19. This retrospective cohort study evaluated the IMPROVE-DD VTE RAM in adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to one of thirteen Northwell Health hospitals in the New York metropolitan area between March 1, 2020 and April 27, 2020. VTE was defined as new-onset symptomatic deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. To assess the predictive value of the RAM, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. Of 9407 patients who met study criteria, 274 patients developed VTE with a prevalence of 2.91%. The VTE rate was 0.41% for IMPROVE-DD score 0-1 (low risk), 1.21% for score 2-3 (moderate risk), and 5.30% for score &#8805; 4 (high risk). Approximately 45.7% of patients were classified as high VTE risk, 33.3% moderate risk, and 21.0% low risk. Discrimination of low versus moderate-high VTE risk demonstrated sensitivity 0.971, specificity 0.215, PPV 0.036, and NPV 0.996. ROC AUC was 0.703. In this external validation study, the IMPROVE-DD VTE RAM demonstrated very good discrimination to identify hospitalized COVID-19 patients at low, moderate, and high VTE risk.","Goldin, Mark; Lin, Stephanie K; Kohn, Nina; Qiu, Michael; Cohen, Stuart L; Barish, Matthew A; Gianos, Eugenia; Diaz, Anise; Richardson, Safiya; Giannis, Dimitrios; Chatterjee, Saurav; Coppa, Kevin; Hirsch, Jamie S; Ngu, Sam; Firoozan, Sheila; McGinn, Thomas; Spyropoulos, Alex C",J. thromb. thrombolysis,,438

METHODS: This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study was conducted from March 14 to March 21, 2020. An online survey was used to collect the basic characteristics of patients with breast cancer. The degree of depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) questionnaires, respectively. Multivariate logistic analysis was performed to identify factors associated with psychological distress outcomes. RESULTS: Among the 834 patients with breast cancer included in the study, the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia was 21.6%, 15.5%, and 14.7%, respectively. No statistically significant difference in the prevalence of these symptoms was observed between patients in Wuhan and those outside Wuhan. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that comorbidity, living alone, deterioration of breast cancer, and affected treatment plan were risk factors for psychological distress including depression, anxiety, and insomnia. When stratified by location, living alone was associated with depression and insomnia only among patients in Wuhan, but not those outside Wuhan. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows an elevated prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia among patients with breast cancer during part of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with comorbidity, living alone, deterioration of breast cancer, and whose treatment plan was affected should be paid more attention to prevent mental disorders.","Chen, Xi; Wang, Longqiang; Liu, Lin; Jiang, Ming; Wang, Weiming; Zhou, Xiaorong; Shao, Jun",Support. care cancer,,438
374272,A Survey on Artificial Intelligence Approaches in Supporting Frontline Workers and Decision Makers for COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"With increasing demands for SARS-CoV-2 testing, as well as the shortages for testing supplies, collection devices, and trained healthcare workers (HCWs) to collect specimens, self-collection is an attractive prospect to reduce the need for HCWs and expenditure of personal protective equipment. Apart from the traditional nasopharyngeal swab used for SARS-CoV-2 detection, alternative specimens have been validated such as a combined swabs of the oropharynx and anterior nares (OP/N), or throat samples using saline gargles. Both the alternative specimen types are amenable to self-collection. Objectives. This study aimed to compare the sensitivity of HCW-collected (OP/N) swabs, self-collected OP/N swabs, and self-collected saline gargles. Among 38 individuals previously testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (or their close contacts), two self-collected specimen types (OP/N and saline gargles) were compared to HCW-collected OP/N swabs. SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed on three molecular assays: a laboratory-developed test (LDT), and two commercial assays on automated platforms: Cobas 6800 (Roche Diagnostics) and Panther (Hologic). The sensitivity of self-collected OP/N swabs was equivalent to healthcare worker (HCW)-collected OP/N swabs at 100.0 % [92.6%-100.0%] for all three molecular tests. The sensitivity of saline gargles was not significantly different than HCW-collected OP/N swabs, but varied slightly between instruments at 93.8 % [85.9%-93.8%] for the LDT, 96.8 % [88.6%-96.8%] for the Cobas assay, and 96.7 % [89.2%-96.9%] for the Panther assay. Overall, self-collection using OP/N swabs or saline gargles are reasonable alternatives to HCW-based collections for SARS-CoV-2 detection, and could facilitate broader surveillance strategies.","LeBlanc, Jason J; Pettipas, Janice; Di Quinzio, Melanie; Hatchette, Todd F; Patriquin, Glenn",J Virol Methods,,438

376254,Review on Management at Mechanical Design and Manufacturing Discipline of NSFC in 2020,2021,"The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is spreading worldwide, with the pathogenesis mostly unclear. Both virus and host-derived microRNA (miRNA) play essential roles in the pathology of virus infection. This study aims to uncover the mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity from the perspective of miRNA. We scanned the SARS-CoV-2 genome for putative miRNA genes and miRNA targets and conducted in vivo experiments to validate the virus-encoded miRNAs and their regulatory role on the putative targets. One of such virus-encoded miRNAs, MR147-3p, was overexpressed that resulted in significantly decreased transcript levels of all of the predicted targets in human, i.e., EXOC7, RAD9A, and TFE3 in the virus-infected cells. The analysis showed that the immune response and cytoskeleton organization are two of the most notable biological processes regulated by the infection-modulated miRNAs. Additionally, the genomic mutation of SARS-CoV-2 contributed to the changed miRNA repository and targets, suggesting a possible role of miRNAs in the attenuated phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 during its evolution. This study provided a comprehensive view of the miRNA-involved regulatory system during SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating possible antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 through intervening miRNA regulation.","Liu, Zhi; Wang, Jianwei; Ge, Yiyue; Xu, Yuyu; Guo, Mengchen; Mi, Kai; Xu, Rui; Pei, Yang; Zhang, Qiankun; Luan, Xiaoting; Hu, Zhibin; Chi, Ying; Liu, Xingyin",J Biomed Res,,438

Fourteen people with sarcopenia (age: 59.40 ± 5.46 years; weight: 68.78 ± 8.31 kg; height: 163.84 ± 9.08 cm) that participated in the study performed three training sessions in a randomized order: 4 sets of 10 repetitions of a half-squat at 60% of the one-repetition maximum and 90 s of rest between set and were either (a) without a mask (NM), (b) wearing a surgical face mask (SM), and (c) wearing a FFP2 face mask (FFP2). We found that wearing face masks had no effect on strength performance (session mean propulsive velocity (m/s): WM: 0.396 ± 0.042; SM: 0.387 ± 0.037; and FFP2: 0.391 ± 0.042 (p = 0.918)).

380113,Covid-19's rapid diagnosis open platform based on X-ray imaging and deep learning,2020,"Pathological narcissism is a term often applied to former President Donald Trump, but it has been less examined as a potential predictor of voting for him. Trump projects a grandiose and omnipotent self-image during press conferences and rallies, and his followers at these events often respond with both effusive admiration and an inflated sense of their own self-regard, all of which are aspects of narcissism. However, while Trump's personal narcissism has been well documented, there is little research on the narcissism of his supporters. In this study we conducted an exploratory analysis examining the hierarchical structure of pathological narcissism and which aspects of narcissism within that structure were associated with intended voting for Trump in the 2020 U.S. presidential election in a sample of U.S. residents collected online (N = 495) using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Results indicated that an eight-echelon hierarchy best fit the data. Within this hierarchy, antagonistic and indifferent aspects of narcissism within the fifth echelon best predicted intended voting for Trump over and above relevant demographic variables. These results have implications for the study of narcissism and, especially given the results of the 2020 election, the degree to which one can make use of narcissistic aspects of personality in political contests.","Yalch, Matthew M",PLoS One,,438

381049,BCS Virtual Festival of Digital Skills,2021,"AimsThere is paucity of information about perspectives of psychiatrists about telemedicine practice during COVID-19 pandemic. It was intended to explore the experience of doctors using tele-psychiatry for provision of clinical care during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Mental Health Trust covering four cities in West Midlands, UK.MethodThe study was conducted as an anonymized questionnaire survey. A 10-item questionnaire was designed with items related to the clinical outcomes, challenges and provider satisfaction when using tele-psychiatry. It had mostly yes/no dichotomous responses along with the scope for making additional comments for each question. An online link of the questionnaire was sent via email to doctors of all grades working across the Black Country Healthcare NHS foundation Trust, in the West Midlands. The survey was open between July and October 2020;and monthly reminders were sent.ResultThe questionnaire was sent out to 159 doctors and 34 responded (response rate of 21.3%). Just over 50% had used both telephone and video consultations, whereas 47.1% responders had used telephone only. More than half (55.8%) reported that the tele-psychiatry affected clinical outcomes;and it was considered positive in around half (52.9%). Most (73.5%) of the responders found that limitations or challenges of using technology impacted on delivery of care remotely. However 64.7% psychiatrists were satisfied with the process overall;and 79.4% reported that they would like to use tele-psychiatry in the future as well.Survey captured many observations from the psychiatrists. Positive comments from the psychiatrists included expedited delivery of care, reduced non-attendance rates, as well as successful multidisciplinary meetings. Challenges in specific sub-specialties such as Child and Adolescent Psychiatry or Older Adult psychiatry were reported where complete assessments were not achieved successfully. The process was felt to be appropriate in general for stable or follow-up patients in comparison to new or acutely unwell patients. There was some worry expressed about missing out non-verbal cues which assist with mental state examination.ConclusionInspite of a low response rate, the survey provided some understanding about the experience of doctors practicing tele-psychiatry during pandemic. While technological challenges were acknowledged, tele-psychiatry seemed to have been accepted by a majority of doctors who are also willing to continue it in their future clinical practice. There is a need to explore in a larger sample involving both patients and clinicians about the beneficial effects of tele-psychiatry that can be incorporated in the usual psychiatric practice.","Chandra, Pallavi Kar Nilamadhab Abdalla Yahia",BJPsych Open,,438

381604,The Transportation Safety Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Comorbidity of acute ischaemic stroke with Covid-19 is a challenging condition, potentially influencing the decision of whether to administer intravenous thrombolysis (IVT). We aimed to assess the 1-month outcome in ischaemic stroke patients with Covid-19 infection who received IVT alone or before thrombectomy (bridging therapy). METHODS: As a collaboration initiative promoted by the Italian Stroke Organization, all Italian stroke units (n = 190) were contacted and invited to participate in data collection on stroke patients with Covid-19 who received IVT. RESULTS: Seventy-five invited centers agreed to participate. Thirty patients received IVT alone and 17 received bridging therapy between 21 February 2020 and 30 April 2020 in 20 centers (n = 18, Northern Italy; n = 2, Central Italy). At 1 month, 14 (30.4%) patients died and 20 (62.5%) survivors had a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 3 to 5. At 24 to 36 hours, asymptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) was reported in eight (17.4%) patients and symptomatic ICH (sICH) in two (4.3%) patients. Causes of death were severe ischaemic stroke (n = 8), a new ischaemic stroke (n = 2), acute respiratory failure (n = 1), acute renal failure (n = 1), acute myocardial infarction (n = 1), and endocarditis (n = 1). In survivors with a 1-month mRS score of 3 to 5, baseline glucose level was higher, whereas endovascular procedure time in cases of bridging therapy was longer. Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale glucose and creatinine levels were higher in patients who died. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous thrombolysis for patients with stroke and Covid-19 was not a rare event in the most affected areas by pandemic, and rates of 1-month unfavorable outcomes were high compared to previous data from the pre-Covid-19 literature.

Consequently, they also turn to informal learning networks, in order to share and collect information and reach out to their communities. In this context, the current study investigates the underlying networks structures among school leaders, what type of information is being shared, and what differences can be identified when comparing a nation-wide and a localized sample. We collected data from a US nation-wide sample of 15 relevant Twitter conversations, as well as Tweets from an US urban mid-sized public school district. Using a mixed-methods approach, we discovered several key structural dimensions and a host of highly influential actors. Moreover, we found semantic evidence for users sharing information on topics such as status reports. Finally, we discovered that the urban sample did not overly use the nation-wide, very specific approach of including COVID-19 related hashtags. Instead, they used more localized terminologies. These findings are valuable for policy makers, as they map the underlying communication patterns and provide valuable insights into who is moving what types of resources as part of the emerging governance approach on social media.","Rehm, Martin; Moukarzel, Sara; Daly, Alan J; Del Fresno, Miguel",British journal of educational technology,,438
383116,COVID-19 and energy access: An opportunity or a challenge for the African continent?,2020,"The emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and its severity highly variable. The fatality rate is unpredictable but is amplified by several factors including advancing age, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and obesity. A large proportion of patients with these conditions are treated with lipid lowering medication and questions regarding the safety of continuing lipid-lowering medication in patients infected with COVID-19 have arisen. Some have suggested they may exacerbate their condition. It is important to consider known interactions with lipid-lowering agents and with specific therapies for COVID-19. This statement aims to collate current evidence surrounding the safety of lipid-lowering medications in patients who have COVID-19. We offer a consensus view based on current knowledge and we rated the strength and level of evidence for these recommendations. Pubmed, Google scholar and Web of Science were searched extensively for articles using search terms: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, coronavirus, Lipids, Statin, Fibrates, Ezetimibe, PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies, nicotinic acid, bile acid sequestrants, nutraceuticals, red yeast rice, Omega-3-Fatty acids, Lomitapide, hypercholesterolaemia, dyslipidaemia and Volanesorsen. There is no evidence currently that lipid lowering therapy is unsafe in patients with COVID-19 infection. Lipid-lowering therapy should not be interrupted because of the pandemic or in patients at increased risk of COVID-19 infection. In patients with confirmed COVID-19, care should be taken to avoid drug interactions, between lipid-lowering medications and drugs that may be used to treat COVID-19, especially in patients with abnormalities in liver function tests.","Iqbal, Zohaib; Ho, Jan Hoong; Adam, Safwaan; France, Michael; Syed, Akheel; Neely, Dermot; Rees, Alan; Khatib, Rani; Cegla, Jaimini; Byrne, Christopher; Qureshi, Nadeem; Capps, Nigel; Ferns, Gordon; Payne, Jules; Schofield, Jonathan; Nicholson, Kirsty; Datta, Dev; Pottle, Alison; Halcox, Julian; Krentz, Andrew; Durrington, Paul; Soran, Handrean",Atherosclerosis,,438

This study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic performance of an immunochromatography-based assay of human serum for COVID-19. The present study enrolled 149 subjects who had been tested by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 and were classified into two groups: 70 who were positive for COVID-19 and 79 who were negative for COVID-19 based on RT-PCR. An immunochromatography-based COVID-19 immunoglobulin G (IgG)/immunoglobulin M (IgM) rapid test on the sera of the study population was applied to measure the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve compared to RT-PCR, with a 95% confidence interval (CI). IgM or IgG antibodies were detected in 65 subjects (92.9%) classified as positive for COVID-19 and in three subjects (3.8%) classified as negative for COVID-19. The sensitivity and specificity percentages for IgM or IgG antibodies were 92.9% (95% CI: 84.1-97.6) and 96.2% (95% CI: 89.3-99.2), respectively, with 95.6% PPV and 93.8% NPV. The PPV rapidly improved with increasing disease prevalence from 19.8% to 96.1% in the presence of either IgM or IgG, while the NPV remained high with a change from 99.9% to 93.1%. The area under the ROC curve was 0.945 (95% CI: 0.903-0.988) for subjects with either IgM or IgG positivity. In conclusion, the immunochromatography-based COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test is a useful and practical diagnostic assay for detection of COVID-19, especially in the presence of IgM or IgG antibodies.","Choe, Jung-Yoon; Kim, Ji-Won; Kwon, Hyun Hee; Hong, Hyo-Lim; Jung, Chi Young; Jeon, Chang-Ho; Park, Eun-Jin; Kim, Seong-Kyu",J. med. virol,,438

387804,Intelligent Authentication System Based on Machine Learning Algorithms,2021,"There is overwhelming evidence on SARS-CoV-2 Airborne Transmission (AT) in the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. It is extraordinarily difficult, however, to deduce a generalized framework to assess the relative airborne transmission risk with respect to other modes. This is due to the complex biophysics entailed in such phenomena. Since the SARS outbreak in 2002, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been one of the main tools scientists used to investigate AT of respiratory viruses. Now, CFD simulations produce intuitive and physically plausible colour-coded results that help scientists understand SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission patterns. In addition to validation requirements, for any CFD model to be of epistemic value to the scientific community; it must be reproducible. In 2020, more than 45 published studies investigated SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission in different scenarios using CFD. Here, I systematically review the published CFD studies of COVID-19 and discuss their reproducibility criteria with respect to the CFD modeling process. Using a Weighted Scoring Model (WSM), I propose a novel reproducibility index for CFD simulations of SARS-CoV-2 AT. The proposed index $(0 \leq R^{CFD}_j \leq 1)$ relies on three reproducibility criteria comprising 10 elements that represent the possibility of a CFD study (j) to be reproduced. Frustratingly, only 3 of 23 studies (13%) achieved full reproducibility index $(R^{CFD}_j\geq 0.9)$ while the remaining 87% were found generally irreproducible $(R^{CFD}_j<0.9)$. Without reproducible models, the scientific benefit of CFD simulations will remain hindered, fragmented and limited. In conclusion, I call the scientific community to apply more rigorous measures on reporting and publishing CFD simulations in COVID-19 research.","Saqr, Khalid M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04874v1.pdf,438
388077,MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 AMONG DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS IN MOROCCO : Optimal Control Approach for Intervention Strategies,2020,"BACKGROUND: Recruitment processes for clinical trials of digital interventions for psychosis are seldom described in detail in the literature. Although trial staff have expertise in describing barriers to and facilitators of recruitment, a specific focus on understanding recruitment from the point of view of trial staff is rare, and because trial staff are responsible for meeting recruitment targets, a lack of research on their point of view is a key limitation. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to understand recruitment from the point of view of trial staff and discover what they consider important. METHODS: We applied pluralistic ethnographic methods, including analysis of trial documents, observation, and focus groups, and explored the recruitment processes of the EMPOWER (Early Signs Monitoring to Prevent Relapse in Psychosis and Promote Well-being, Engagement, and Recovery) feasibility trial, which is a digital app-based intervention for people diagnosed with schizophrenia. RESULTS: Recruitment barriers were categorized into 2 main themes: service characteristics (lack of time available for mental health staff to support recruitment, staff turnover, patient turnover [within Australia only], management styles of community mental health teams, and physical environment) and clinician expectations (filtering effects and resistance to research participation). Trial staff negotiated these barriers through strategies such as emotional labor (trial staff managing feelings and expressions to successfully recruit participants) and trying to build relationships with clinical staff working within community mental health teams. CONCLUSIONS: Researchers in clinical trials for digital psychosis interventions face numerous recruitment barriers and do their best to work flexibly and to negotiate these barriers and meet recruitment targets. The recruitment process appeared to be enhanced by trial staff supporting each other throughout the recruitment stage of the trial.","Allan, Stephanie; Mcleod, Hamish; Bradstreet, Simon; Bell, Imogen; Whitehill, Helen; Wilson-Kay, Alison; Clark, Andrea; Matrunola, Claire; Morton, Emma; Farhall, John; Gleeson, John; Gumley, Andrew",JMIR Hum Factors,,438

Italy was one of the first European countries to be severely affected by the outbreak and to establish lockdown and stay-at-home orders, potentially leading to country reputation damage. We resort to sentiment analysis to investigate changes in opinions about Italy reported on Twitter before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Using different lexicons-based methods, we find a breakpoint corresponding to the date of the first established case of COVID-19 in Italy that causes a relevant change in sentiment scores used as proxy of the country reputation. Next, we demonstrate that sentiment scores about Italy are strongly associated with the levels of the FTSE-MIB index, the Italian Stock Exchange main index, as they serve as early detection signals of changes in the values of FTSE-MIB. Finally, we make a content-based classification of tweets into positive and negative and use two machine learning classifiers to validate the assigned polarity of tweets posted before and after the outbreak.","Zammarchi, Gianpaolo; Mola, Francesco; Conversano, Claudio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.13871v1.pdf,438

Multifarious approaches to risk management have been explored for combating an epidemic spread. This work presents the implementation of engineering safety principles to pandemic risk management. We have assessed the pandemic risk using Paté-Cornell's six levels of uncertainty. The susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined, recovered, deceased (SEIQRD), an advanced mechanistic model, along with the Monte Carlo simulation, has been used to estimate the fatality risk. The risk minimization strategies have been categorized into hierarchical safety measures. We have developed an event tree model of pandemic risk management for distinct risk-reducing strategies realized due to natural evolution, government interventions, societal responses, and individual practices. The roles of distinct interventions have also been investigated for an infected individual's survivability with the existing healthcare facilities. We have studied the Corona Virus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) for pandemic risk management using the proposed framework.

COVID-19 was emerged due to the SARS-CoV-2 that is highly infectious pandemic. Every country tried to control the COVID-19 spread by imposing different types of lockdowns. Therefore, there is an urgent need to forecast the daily confirmed infected cases and deaths in different types of lockdown to select the most appropriate lockdown strategies to control the intensity of this pandemic and reduce the burden in hospitals. Currently are imposed three types of lockdown (partial, herd, complete) in different countries. In this study, three countries from every type of lockdown were studied by applying time-series and machine learning models, named as random forests, K-nearest neighbors, SVM, decision trees (DTs), polynomial regression, Holt winter, ARIMA, and SARIMA to forecast daily confirm infected cases and deaths due to COVID-19. The models' accuracy and effectiveness were evaluated by error based on three performance criteria. Actually, a single forecasting model could not capture all data sets' trends due to the varying nature of data sets and lockdown types. Three top-ranked models were used to predict the confirmed infected cases and deaths, the outperformed models were also adopted for the out-of-sample prediction and obtained very close results to the actual values of cumulative infected cases and deaths due to COVID-19.

395918,"Impact of COVID-19 on IoT Adoption in Healthcare, Smart Homes, Smart Buildings, Smart Cities, Transportation and Industrial IoT",2021,"The Nrf2-Keap1-ARE pathway is the principal regulator of antioxidant and phase II detoxification genes. Its activation increases the expression of antioxidant and cytoprotective proteins, protecting cells against infections. Nrf2 modulates virus-induced oxidative stress, ROS generation, and disease pathogenesis, which are vital in the viral life cycle. During respiratory viral infections, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), an inflammatory process, and oxidative stress of the epithelium lining cells activate the transcription factor Nrf2, which protects cells from oxidative stress and inflammation. Nrf2 reduces angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors expression in respiratory epithelial cells. SARS-CoV2 has a high affinity for ACE2 that works as receptors for coronavirus surface spike glycoprotein, facilitating viral entry. Disease severity may also be modulated by pre-existing conditions, such as impaired immune response, obesity, and age, where decreased level of Nrf2 is a common feature. Consequently, Nrf2 activators may increase Nrf2 levels and enhance antiviral mediators’ expression, which could initiate an “antiviral state”, priming cells against viral infection. Therefore, this hypothesis paper describes the use of flavonoid supplements combined with vitamin D3 to activate Nrf2, which may be a potential target to prevent and/or decrease SARS-CoV-2 infection severity, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, enhancing innate immunity, and downregulating ACE2 receptors.","Mendonca, Patricia; Soliman, Karam F.

We supposed that automatic objective refraction will be the most exact method so we choose this method as the reference method. For comparison we chose subjective methods Jackson crossed cylinders (JCC), fogging method (FM) and objective method Spot Vision Screener (SVS, WelschAllyn). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We had in total 30 subjects with average age 23 years (SD 1 year) in our study. We made each measurement per eye separately and it was independent measurement so we could use measurement from each eye (n = 60). Each eye was firstly measured by subjective method FM, followed by JCC method and finally was use objective method Spot Vision Screener (SVS, WelschAllyn). Measurement with objective instrument TRK-1P (TOPCON) was use as reference measurement. The significance level was set at p = 0.05. RESULTS: In variable FM we measured sensitivity 76.2 % and specificity 66.7 %. Criterion for positive finding was -0.25 D. Result was statistically significant on level p &lt; 0.001. In variable JCC we measured sensitivity 95.2 % and specificity 66.7 %. Criterion for positive finding was -0.25 D. Result was statistically significant on level p &lt; 0.001. In variable SVS we measured sensitivity 47.6 % and specificity 94.4 %. Criterion for positive finding was -0.75 D. Result was statistically significant on level p &lt; 0.001. Direct comparison of all methods showed statistically important difference between techniques JCC and FM (p = 0.0095). In other method we did not find statistically important difference (FM vs. SVS, p = 0.526 and JCC vs. SVS, p = 0.105). CONCLUSION: All subjective and objective techniques were statistically significant in detection of eye astigmatism. Comparison of ROC curves showed statistically significant difference between FM and JCC technique. The JCC method showed the highest sensitivity, whereas SVS highest specificity.","Veselý, P; Petrová, S; Benes, P",Cesk Slov Oftalmol,,438

We evaluated the role of a combined effort of early hospitalization in combination with early antiviral therapy with COVID-19 patients in a tertiary care university hospital. Materials and Methods This was a prospective, observational, single center study on probable/confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a tertiary care hospital COVID-19 wards between March 20- April 30, 2020. Critically-ill patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) at the time of admission were excluded. The demographic, laboratory, and clinical data were collected. Results We included 174 consecutive probable/confirmed COVID-19 adult patients hospitalized in the Internal Medicine wards of the University Adult Hospital between March 20 and April 30, 2020. The median age was 45.5 (19-92) years and 91 patients (52.3% ) were male. 120 (69%) were confirmed microbiologically, 41 (23.5%) radiologically diagnosed and, 13 (7.5%) were clinically suspected (negative microbiological and radiological findings compatible with COVID-19). According to WHO definitions, 35 (20.1%) had mild, 107 (61.5%) moderate disease, and 32 (18.4%) had severe pneumonia. Of 130/171 ( 74.3%) showed pneumonia; 80 were typical, 50 indeterminate infiltration for COVID-19. Patients admitted within a median of 3 days (0-14 days) after symptoms appear. The median duration of hospitalization was 4 days (0 - 28 days). In this case series, 13.2% patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine alone, 64.9% with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, and 18.4% with regimens including favipiravir. A total of 15 patients (8.5%) were transferred to the ICU. Four patients died (2.2%). Conclusion In our series, early of 174 patients admitted to the hospital wards for COVID-19, 69% confirmed with PCR and/or antibody test. On the admission nearly one fifth of the patients had severe diseases. 95.4% of the patients received HQ alone or in combination.

In this study, we applied a rule-based phenotyping algorithm to classify COVID-19 patients requiring ventilatory support. We analyzed patient outcomes of the different phenotypes based on type and sequence of ventilation therapy. Invasive mechanical ventilation, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and high flow nasal insufflation were three therapies used to phenotype patients leading to a total of seven subgroups; patients treated with a single therapy (3), patients treated with either form of noninvasive ventilation and subsequently requiring intubation (2), and patients initially intubated and then weaned onto a noninvasive therapy (2). In addition to summary statistics for each phenotype, we highlight data quality challenges and importance of mapping to standard terminologies. This work illustrates potential impact of accurate phenotyping on patient-level and system-level outcomes including appropriate resource allocation under resource constrained circumstances.","Essay, Patrick; Mosier, Jarrod; Subbian, Vignesh",Stud Health Technol Inform,,438

In understanding the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity and mechanism of action, it is essential to depict the full repertoire of expressed viral proteins. The recent biological studies have highlighted the leader protein Nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 importance in shutting down the host protein production. Besides, it still enigmatic how Nsp1 regulates for translation. Here we report the novel structure of Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2 in complex with the SL1 region of 5'UTR of SARS-CoV-2, and its factual interaction is corroborated with enzyme kinetics and experimental binding affinity studies. The studies also address how leader protein Nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 recognizes its self RNA toward translational regulation by further recruitment of the 40S ribosome. With the aid of molecular dynamics and simulations, we also demonstrated the real-time stability and functional dynamics of the Nsp1/SL1 complex. The studies also report the potential inhibitors and their mode of action to block viral protein/RNA complex formation. This enhance our understanding of the mechanism of the first viral protein Nsp1 synthesized in the human cell to regulate the translation of self and host. Understanding the structure and mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 and its interplay with the viral RNA and ribosome will open the arena for exploring the development of live attenuated vaccines and effective therapeutic targets for this disease.","Vankadari, Naveen; Jeyasankar, Nandhini Nisha; Lopes, Wilma Jerom",J Phys Chem Lett,,438

Point prevalence surveys (PPSs) provide information on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection status of staff and residents in nursing homes and enable isolation of infectious persons to halt disease spread. We collected 16 weeks of public health surveillance data on a subset of nursing homes (34/212) in Connecticut, USA. We fit a Poisson regression model to evaluate the association between incidence and time since serial PPS onset, adjusting for decreasing community incidence and other factors. Nursing homes conducted a combined total of 205 PPSs in staff and 232 PPSs in residents. PPS was associated with 41%-80% reduction in incidence rate in nursing homes.

402484,Research on intelligent prevention and control of COVID-19 in China's urban rail transit based on artificial intelligence and big data,2020,"Effective therapies to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are urgently needed. While many investigational, approved, and repurposed drugs have been suggested as potential treatments, preclinical data from animal models can guide the search for effective treatments by ruling out those that lack efficacy in vivo. Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a nucleotide analogue prodrug with broad antiviral activity1,2 that is currently being investigated in COVID-19 clinical trials and recently received Emergency Use Authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration3,4. In animal models, remdesivir was effective against infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)2,5,6. In vitro, remdesivir inhibited replication of SARS-CoV-27,8. Here we investigate the efficacy of remdesivir in a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection9. Unlike vehicle-treated animals, macaques treated with remdesivir did not show signs of respiratory disease; they also showed reduced pulmonary infiltrates on radiographs and reduced virus titres in bronchoalveolar lavages twelve hours after the first dose. Virus shedding from the upper respiratory tract was not reduced by remdesivir treatment. At necropsy, remdesivir-treated animals had lower lung viral loads and reduced lung damage. Thus, treatment with remdesivir initiated early during infection had a clinical benefit in rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2. Although the rhesus macaque model does not represent the severe disease observed in some patients with COVID-19, our data support the early initiation of remdesivir treatment in patients with COVID-19 to prevent progression to pneumonia.","Williamson, Brandi N; Feldmann, Friederike; Schwarz, Benjamin; Meade-White, Kimberly; Porter, Danielle P; Schulz, Jonathan; van Doremalen, Neeltje; Leighton, Ian; Yinda, Claude Kwe; Pérez-Pérez, Lizzette; Okumura, Atsushi; Lovaglio, Jamie; Hanley, Patrick W; Saturday, Greg; Bosio, Catharine M; Anzick, Sarah; Barbian, Kent; Cihlar, Tomas; Martens, Craig; Scott, Dana P; Munster, Vincent J; de Wit, Emmie",Nature,,438

Data are limited on the duration and host factors related to viral shedding. METHODS: In this retrospective study, risk factors associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA shedding were evaluated in a cohort of 113 symptomatic patients from 2 hospitals outside Wuhan. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was 17 (13-22) days as measured from illness onset. When comparing patients with early (<15 days) and late (&#8805;15 days after illness onset) viral RNA clearance, prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was associated with male sex (P = .009), old age (P = .033), concomitant hypertension (P = .009), delayed admission to hospital after illness onset (P = .001), severe illness at admission (P = .049), invasive mechanical ventilation (P = .006), and corticosteroid treatment (P = .025). Patients with longer SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding duration had slower recovery of body temperature (P < .001) and focal absorption on radiograph images (P < .001) than patients with early SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance. Male sex (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.31-8.02), delayed hospital admission (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.10-1.54), and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR, 9.88; 95% CI, 1.11-88.02) were independent risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. CONCLUSIONS: Male sex, delayed admission to hospital after illness onset, and invasive mechanical ventilation were associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. Hospital admission and general treatments should be started as soon as possible in symptomatic COVID-19 patients, especially male patients.","Xu, Kaijin; Chen, Yanfei; Yuan, Jing; Yi, Ping; Ding, Cheng; Wu, Wenrui; Li, Yongtao; Ni, Qin; Zou, Rongrong; Li, Xiaohe; Xu, Min; Zhang, Ying; Zhao, Hong; Zhang, Xuan; Yu, Liang; Su, Junwei; Lang, Guanjing; Liu, Jun; Wu, Xiaoxin; Guo, Yongzheng; Tao, Jingjing; Shi, Ding; Yu, Ling; Cao, Qing; Ruan, Bing; Liu, Lei; Wang, Zhaoqin; Xu, Yan; Liu, Yingxia; Sheng, Jifang; Li, Lanjuan",Clin Infect Dis,,438

Methods: We collected 48 pairs of tumor and adjacent normal tissues from patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Both 786-o and caki-1 ccRCC cell lines were transfected with GA-binding protein transcription factor subunit beta-1 antisense RNA 1 (GABPB1-AS1), miR-1246, or small interfering RNA phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (siPCK1) vectors. RNA expression was examined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and protein expression by Western blot. Cell proliferation was measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 assays. Cell migration and invasion were measured by transwell assays. Targeting relationships between genes were tested by luciferase reporter gene assays. Results: Lower GABPB1-AS1 expression was found in ccRCC cells and tissues. GABPB1-AS1 expression was inversely associated with tumor size, TNM stage, and Furhman stage. High GABPB1-AS1 expression was associated with a better prognosis. GABPB1-AS1 overexpression significantly inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion by 786-o and caki-1 cells. GABPB1-AS1 overexpression reduced tumor weights in xenograft experiments. Luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-1246 overexpression significantly inhibited the luciferase activity of 786-o and caki-1 cells transfected with wild-type (WT)-GABPB1-AS1 or WT-PCK1. Knockdown of PCK1 weakened the inhibition of proliferation, migration, and invasion induced by GABPB1-AS1 overexpression in 786-o and caki-1 cells. Conclusion: GABPB1-AS1 inhibits ccRCC growth and plays a tumor suppressor role through an miR-1246/PCK1 axis.","Gao, Shuang; Zhang, Feng; Sun, Hanxue; Yang, Xianghong",Onco Targets Ther,,438

Recently, this issue of fairness in predictions has attracted significant attention, as data-driven models are increasingly utilized to perform crucial decision-making tasks. Methods to achieve fairness in the machine learning literature typically build a single prediction model subject to some fairness criteria in a manner that encourages fair prediction performances for all groups. These approaches have two major limitations: i) fairness is often achieved by compromising accuracy for some groups;ii) the underlying relationship between dependent and independent variables may not be the same across groups. We propose a Joint Fairness Model (JFM) approach for binary outcomes that estimates group-specific classifiers using a joint modeling objective function that incorporates fairness criteria for prediction. We introduce an Accelerated Smoothing Proximal Gradient Algorithm to solve the convex objective function, and demonstrate the properties of the proposed JFM estimates. Next, we presented the key asymptotic properties for the JFM parameter estimates. We examined the efficacy of the JFM approach in achieving prediction performances and parities, in comparison with the Single Fairness Model, group-separate model, and group-ignorant model through extensive simulations. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of the JFM method in the motivating example to obtain fair risk predictions for under-represented older patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Do, H.; Nandi, S.; Putzel, P.; Smyth, P.; Zhong, J.",,,438

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to characterize the course of COVID-19 in patients with psoriasis and identify factors associated with hospitalization. METHODS: Clinicians reported patients with psoriasis with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 via an international registry, Psoriasis Patient Registry for Outcomes, Therapy and Epidemiology of COVID-19 Infection. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the association between clinical and/or demographic characteristics and hospitalization. A separate patient-facing registry characterized risk-mitigating behaviors. RESULTS: Of 374 clinician-reported patients from 25 countries, 71% were receiving a biologic, 18% were receiving a nonbiologic, and 10% were not receiving any systemic treatment for psoriasis. In all, 348 patients (93%) were fully recovered from COVID-19, 77 (21%) were hospitalized, and 9 (2%) died. Increased hospitalization risk was associated with older age (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.59 per 10 years; 95% CI = 1.19-2.13), male sex (OR = 2.51; 95% CI = 1.23-5.12), nonwhite ethnicity (OR = 3.15; 95% CI = 1.24-8.03), and comorbid chronic lung disease (OR = 3.87; 95% CI = 1.52-9.83). Hospitalization was more frequent in patients using nonbiologic systemic therapy than in those using biologics (OR = 2.84; 95% CI = 1.31-6.18). No significant differences were found between classes of biologics. Independent patient-reported data (n = 1626 across 48 countries) suggested lower levels of social isolation in individuals receiving nonbiologic systemic therapy than in those receiving biologics (OR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.50-0.94). CONCLUSION: In this international case series of patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, biologic use was associated with lower risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization than with use of nonbiologic systemic therapies; however, further investigation is warranted on account of potential selection bias and unmeasured confounding. Established risk factors (being older, being male, being of nonwhite ethnicity, and having comorbidities) were associated with higher hospitalization rates.","Mahil, Satveer K; Dand, Nick; Mason, Kayleigh J; Yiu, Zenas Z N; Tsakok, Teresa; Meynell, Freya; Coker, Bola; McAteer, Helen; Moorhead, Lucy; Mackenzie, Teena; Rossi, Maria Teresa; Rivera, Raquel; Mahe, Emmanuel; Carugno, Andrea; Magnano, Michela; Rech, Giulia; Balogh, Esther A; Feldman, Steven R; De La Cruz, Claudia; Choon, Siew Eng; Naldi, Luigi; Lambert, Jo; Spuls, Phyllis; Jullien, Denis; Bachelez, Hervé; McMahon, Devon E; Freeman, Esther E; Gisondi, Paolo; Puig, Luis; Warren, Richard B; Di Meglio, Paola; Langan, Sinéad M; Capon, Francesca; Griffiths, Christopher E M; Barker, Jonathan N; Smith, Catherine H",J. allergy clin. immunol,,438

The study aims is to present a case with post-covid-19 pulmonary fungal infection with antifungal resistance characteristics. Case presentation: A 50-year-old male presented with hemoptysis, dyspnea, cough, fever, and rigor for 4-month duration. Three weeks before this complaint, he had cured of COVID-19. Investigations showed multiple ill-defined cavitary lesions involving the left upper lobe. The patient underwent a left upper lobectomy. The post-operative period was uneventful. Clinical discussion: All studies of COVID-19 fungal infections reported occurrence during the COVID-19 infection, mostly 14 days after the appearance of COVID-19 symptoms. The case in the current study was a 50-year-old patient, who was previously diagnosed with COVID-19 for a period of 4 months. After a few days from his recovery, the patient developed dyspnea, cough, fever, and rigor again. Conclusion: pulmonary aspergillosis is a serious complication of COVID-19 patients that may not respond well to medical therapy. Pulmonary resection is the last and effective strategy to control the disease.","Kakamad, Fahmi H; Mahmood, Safeen O; Rahim, Hawbash M; Abdulla, Berwn A; Abdullah, Hiwa O; Othman, Snur; Mohammed, Shvan H; Kakamad, Suhaib H; Mustafa, Shevan M; Salih, Abdulwahid M",Int J Surg Case Rep,,438

This pandemic is associated with markedly elevated blood glucose levels and a remarkable degree of insulin resistance, which suggests pancreatic islet ß-cell dysfunction or apoptosis and insulin's inability to dispose of glucose into cellular tissues. Diabetes is known to be one of the top pre-existing co-morbidities associated with the severity of COVID-19 along with hypertension, cardiocerebrovascular disease, advanced age, male gender, and recently obesity. This review focuses on how COVID-19 may be responsible for the accelerated development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as one of its acute and suspected long-term complications. These observations implicate an active role of metabolic syndrome, systemic and tissue islet renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, redox stress, inflammation, islet fibrosis, amyloid deposition along with ß-cell dysfunction and apoptosis in those who develop T2DM. Utilizing light and electron microscopy in preclinical rodent models and human islets may help to better understand how COVID-19 accelerates islet and ß-cell injury and remodeling to result in the long-term complications of T2DM.","Hayden, Melvin R",,,438

However, in real-world scenarios, knowledge and observations of the network may be limited thereby precluding a full assessment of the optimal nodes to immunize (or remove) in order to avoid epidemic spreading such as that of current COVID-19 epidemic. Here, we study a novel immunization strategy where only $n$ nodes are observed at a time and the most central between these $n$ nodes is immunized (or attacked). This process is continued repeatedly until $1-p$ fraction of nodes are immunized (or attacked). We develop an analytical framework for this approach and determine the critical percolation threshold $p_c$ and the size of the giant component $P_{\infty}$ for networks with arbitrary degree distributions $P(k)$. In the limit of $n\to\infty$ we recover prior work on targeted attack, whereas for $n=1$ we recover the known case of random failure. Between these two extremes, we observe that as $n$ increases, $p_c$ increases quickly towards its optimal value under targeted immunization (attack) with complete information. In particular, we find a new scaling relationship between $|p_c(\infty)-p_c(n)|$ and $n$ as $|p_c(\infty)-p_c(n)|\sim n^{-1}\exp(-\alpha n)$. For Scale-free (SF) networks, where $P(k)\sim k^{-\gamma}, 2<\gamma<3$, we find that $p_c$ has a transition from zero to non-zero when $n$ increases from $n=1$ to order of $\log N$ ($N$ is the size of network). Thus, for SF networks, knowledge of order of $\log N$ nodes and immunizing them can reduce dramatically an epidemics.","Liu, Yangyang; Sanhedrai, Hillel; Dong, GaoGao; Shekhtman, Louis M.; Wang, Fan; Buldyrev, Sergey V.; Havlin, Shlomo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00825v1.pdf,438

The pandemic has been sweeping the globe, impacting more than 200 countries, with more outbreaks still lurking on the horizon. At the time of the writing, no approved drugs or vaccines are available to treat COVID-19 patients, prompting an urgent need to decipher mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and develop curative treatments. To fight COVID-19, researchers around the world have provided specific tools and molecular information for SARS-CoV-2. These pieces of information can be integrated to aid computational investigations and facilitate clinical research. This paper reviews current knowledge, the current status of drug development and various resources for key steps toward effective treatment of COVID-19, including the phylogenetic characteristics, genomic conservation and interaction data. The final goal of this paper is to provide information that may be utilized in bioinformatics approaches and aid target prioritization and drug repurposing. Several SARS-CoV-2-related tools/databases were reviewed, and a web-portal named OverCOVID (http://bis.zju.edu.cn/overcovid/) is constructed to provide a detailed interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 basics and share a collection of resources that may contribute to therapeutic advances. These information could improve researchers' understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and help to accelerate the development of new antiviral treatments.","Ahsan, Md Asif; Liu, Yongjing; Feng, Cong; Zhou, Yincong; Ma, Guangyuan; Bai, Youhuang; Chen, Ming",Brief. bioinform,,438
418353,Guest editorial,2021,"Recently, considerable literature has grown up around the theme of few-shot named entity recognition (NER), but little published benchmark data specifically focused on the practical and challenging task. Current approaches collect existing supervised NER datasets and re-organize them to the few-shot setting for empirical study. These strategies conventionally aim to recognize coarse-grained entity types with few examples, while in practice, most unseen entity types are fine-grained. In this paper, we present Few-NERD, a large-scale human-annotated few-shot NER dataset with a hierarchy of 8 coarse-grained and 66 fine-grained entity types. Few-NERD consists of 188,238 sentences from Wikipedia, 4,601,160 words are included and each is annotated as context or a part of a two-level entity type. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first few-shot NER dataset and the largest human-crafted NER dataset. We construct benchmark tasks with different emphases to comprehensively assess the generalization capability of models. Extensive empirical results and analysis show that Few-NERD is challenging and the problem requires further research.

421374,On exploiting Data Visualization and IoT for Increasing Sustainability and Safety in a Smart Campus,2021,"Introduction: As coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) spread worldwide and social restrictions were intensified, difficulties in blood supply were expected to result in a shortage of blood donors, logistic issues and a change in blood consumption. Consequences could be detrimental to the meeting of the blood supply demand, especially in a decentralized blood bank in the State of São Paulo responsible for providing blood to more than 100 hospitals, mostly of the public health system. Aiming to minimize negative effects and focusing on maintenance of the blood supply, a different approach was discussed and adopted. Materials and Methods: Briefly, strategies were related to monitoring and promoting measures to achieve a positive RBC unit balance. Thus, the number of donors, transfusions, RBC unit inventory, RBC unit loss and RBC units within up to 5 days from the expiration date were evaluated. Results: Several strategies were adopted to ensure sufficient availability of RBC units: blood donation was improved with social media and extra blood collections, a restrictive transfusion protocol was implemented, a new logistic process to use RBC units closer to the expiration date was established and non-isogroup transfusions were avoided. Conclusion: Altogether, described strategies were crucial to optimize blood storage during the pandemic. Investing in monitoring and logistics contributed to a positive RBC unit balance and conserving these strategies could be useful.","Costa, Cristiano Batista; Cortez, Afonso José Pereira; Adão, Daiane Daniela; de Almeida, Carolina Maganha; Taguchi, Ellen Mari; de Oliveira, Ingrid; Santos, Janaína Fernanda de Oliveira; da Rosa, Ana Paula Rodrigues; Tokunaga, Juliana Trapanotto da Silva; Arnoni, Carine Prisco; Latini, Flavia Roche Moreira","Hematol., Transfus.

We used the Gold Standard Diagnostics ELISA to evaluate the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies in sera of 82 hospitalized patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Serum samples were collected 1-59 days post-onset of symptoms (PoS) and we examined the association of age, sex, disease severity, and symptoms' duration with antibody levels. We also tested sera of 100 ambulatory hospital employees with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and samples collected during convalescence, 35-57 days PoS. All but four of the admitted patients (95.1%) developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Antibodies were detected within 7 days PoS; IgA in 60.0%, IgM in 53.3%, and IgG in 46.7% of samples. IgG positivity increased to 100% on Day 21. We did not observe significant differences in the rate of antibody development in regard to age and sex. IgA levels were highest in patients with a severe and critical illness. In multiple regression analyses, only IgA levels were statistically significantly correlated with critical disease (p = .05) regardless of age, sex, and duration of symptoms. Among 100 ambulatory hospital employees who had antibody testing after 4 weeks PoS only 10% had positive IgA antibodies. The most frequently isolated isotype in sera of employees after 30 days PoS was IgG (88%). IgA was the predominant immunoglobulin in early disease and correlated independently with a critical illness. IgG antibodies remained detectable in almost 90% of samples collected up to two months after infection.","Zervou, Fainareti N; Louie, Ping; Stachel, Anna; Zacharioudakis, Ioannis M; Ortiz-Mendez, Yadira; Thomas, Kristen; Aguero-Rosenfeld, Maria E",J Med Virol,,438

In this short report, we estimate mortality rates among street-connected young people in an urban setting in Kenya and calculate standardized mortality ratios to assess excess mortality among street-connected young people compared to the general population of Kenyan adolescents. We collected data on deaths among street-connected young people aged 0-29 between 2010 and 2015. We calculated sex-stratified standardized mortality ratios for street-connected young people aged 0-19 and 20-29 from 2010 to 2015, using publicly available Kenya population data as reference. We found that between 2010 and 2015, there were 69 deaths among street-connected young people aged 0 to 29 years in 2013 was 1,248: 341 females (27%) and 907 males (73%). The standardized mortality ratios among street-connected females aged 0-19 and 20-29 years were 2.79 (95% CI 1.44-4.88) and 7.55 (95% CI 3.77-13.51), respectively; standardized mortality ratios among street-connected males aged 0-19 and 20-29 years were 0.71 (95% CI 0.32-1.35) and 5.48 (95% CI 3.86-7.55), respectively. In conclusion, we found that mortality among street-connected young people in an urban setting in Kenya is elevated compared to the general population of Kenyan young people. States should act urgently and take responsibility for protecting street-connected young people's human rights by scaling up programs to prevent morbidity and death associated with youth street involvement.","Kibel, Mia; Pierzchalski, James; Gorfinkel, Lauren; Embleton, Lonnie; Ayuku, David; Hogg, Robert; Braitstein, Paula",Glob Health Action,,438

To help combat the prolonged pandemic that has exposed vulnerabilities impacting community resilience, in this paper, based on our established large-scale COVID-19 related social media data, we propose and develop an integrated framework (named Dr.Emotion) to learn disentangled representations of social media posts (i.e., tweets) for emotion analysis and thus to gain deep insights into public perceptions towards COVID-19. In Dr.Emotion, for given social media posts, we first post-train a transformer-based model to obtain the initial post embeddings. Since users may implicitly express their emotions in social media posts which could be highly entangled with other descriptive information in the post content, to address this challenge for emotion analysis, we propose an adversarial disentangler by integrating emotion-independent (i.e., sentiment-neutral) priors of the posts generated by another post-trained transformer-based model to separate and disentangle the implicitly encoded emotions from the content in latent space for emotion classification at the first attempt. Extensive experimental studies are conducted to fully evaluate Dr.Emotion and promising results demonstrate its performance in emotion analysis by comparison with the state-of-the-art baseline methods. By exploiting our developed Dr.Emotion, we further perform emotion analysis over a large number of social media posts and provide in-depth investigation from both temporal and geographical perspectives, based on which additional work can be conducted to extract and transform the constructive ideas, experiences and support into actionable information to improve community resilience in responses to a variety of crises created by COVID-19 and well beyond.

We aimed to study the effects of newly initiated antihypertensive drugs on angiotensin (Ang) II and Ang (1-7) as representers of two counter-regulatory axes. (2) Methods: In this randomized, open-label trial investigating RAAS peptides after the initiation of perindopril, olmesartan, amlodipine, or hydrochlorothiazide, Ang II and Ang (1-7) equilibrium concentrations were measured at 8 a.m. and 12 a.m. at baseline and after four weeks of treatment. Eighty patients were randomized (1:1:1:1 fashion). (3) Results: Between the four substances, we found significant differences regarding the concentrations of Ang II (p < 0.0005 for 8 a.m., 12 a.m.) and Ang (1-7) (p = 0.019 for 8 a.m., <0.0005 for 12 a.m.) four weeks after treatment start. Ang II was decreased by perindopril (p = 0.002), and increased by olmesartan (p < 0.0005), amlodipine (p = 0.012), and hydrochlorothiazide (p = 0.001). Ang (1-7) was increased by perindopril and olmesartan (p = 0.008/0.002), but not measurably altered by amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide (p = 0.317/ 0.109). (4) Conclusion: The initiation of all first line antihypertensive treatments causes early and distinct alterations of equilibrium angiotensin levels. Given the additional AT1R blocking action of olmesartan, RAAS peptides shift upon initiation of perindopril and olmesartan appear to work in favor of the anti-inflammatory axis compared to amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide.","Vischer, Annina S; Kuster, Gabriela M; Twerenbold, Raphael; Pfister, Otmar; Zhou, Qian; Villiger, Andrea; Poglitsch, Marko; Krähenbühl, Stephan; Mayr, Michael; Osswald, Stefan; Haschke, Manuel; Burkard, Thilo",,,438

Methods Large-sample statistical methods and proprietary data from the National Agricultural Workers Survey from 2000 to 2018 were used to assess factors associated with exposure to COVID-19 and vulnerabilities associated with medical complications. Results An aging workforce and increased access to health care within the crop worker population has been associated with a higher reported incidence of diabetes, asthma, and heart disease among workers over time. These trends confirm a vulnerable, but essential, workforce with higher risks for COVID-19 complications than would have been true of U.S. farmworkers as a group in earlier years. Conclusions Increasing age and disease burden in the U.S. agricultural labor force puts workers at increased risk for developing COVID-19 complications. Limits to field sanitation and housing quality inflate the probability of the development of COVID-19 hotbeds in rural communities that could further compromise the physical health of workers, the economic health of farm establishments, the agricultural supply-chain, and rural health capacities. Additional and more targeted worker protections may minimize public health and economic costs in the long run.","Fan, Maoyong; Pena, Anita Alves",J Agromedicine,,438

430355,What does energy security mean for energy-exporting countries? A closer look at the Russian energy security strategy,2020,"Actuality One of the most widely discussed treatments for patients with COVID-19, especially at the beginning of the epidemy, was the use of the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The first small non-randomized trials showed the ability of HCQ and its combination with azithromycin to accelerate the elimination of the virus and ease the acute phase of the disease. Later, large, randomized trials did not confirm it (RECOVERY, SOLIDARITY). This study is a case-control study in which we compared patients who received and did not receive HCQ.Material and Methods 103 patients (25 in the HCQ treatment group and 78 in the control group) with confirmed COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA was detected in 26 of 73 in the control group (35.6%) and in 10 of 25 (40%) in the HCQ group) and in the rest - a typical picture of viral pneumonia on multislice computed tomography [MSCT]) were included in the analysis. The severity of lung damage was limited to stages I-II, the CRP level should not exceed 60 mg/dL, and oxygen saturation in the air within 92-98%. We planned to analysis the duration of treatment of patients in the hospital, the days until the normalization of body temperature, the number of points according to the original SHOCS-COVID integral scale, and changes in its components (C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and the percentage of lung damage according to MSCT).Results Analysis for the whole group revealed a statistically significant increase in the time to normalization of body temperature from 4 to 7 days (by 3 days, p&lt;0.001), and the duration of hospitalization from 9.4 to 11.8 days (by 2.4 days, p=0.002) when using HCQ in comparison with control. Given the incomplete balance of the groups, the main analysis included 46 patients who were matched by propensity score matching. The trend towards similar dynamics continued. HCQ treatment slowed down the time to normalization of body temperature by 1.8 days (p=0.074) and lengthened the hospitalization time by 2.1 days (p=0.042). The decrease in scores on the SHOCS -COVID scale was statistically significant in both groups, and there were no differences between them (delta - 3.00 (2.90) in the HCQ group and - 2.69 (1.55) in control, p=0.718). At the same time, in the control group, the CRP level returned to normal (4.06 mg/dl), and with the use of GC, it decreased but remained above the norm (6.21 mg/dl, p=0.05). Side effects requiring discontinuation of treatment were reported in 3 patients in the HCQ group and none in the control group.Conclusion We have not identified any positive properties of HCQ and its ability to influence the severity of COVID-19. This antimalarial agent slows down the normalization of the body's inflammatory response and lengthens the time spent in the hospital. HCQ should not be used in the treatment of COVID-19.","Kamalov, A A; Mareev, V Yu; Orlova, Ya A; Plisyk, A G; Akopyan, Z A; Mareev, Yu V; Mershina, E A; Begrambekova, Yu L; Pakhomov, P V",Kardiologiia,,438
431485,"ECOL: Early Detection of COVID Lies Using Content, Prior Knowledge and Source Information",2021,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether overall lifestyles mediate associations of socioeconomic status (SES) with mortality and incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the extent of interaction or joint relations of lifestyles and SES with health outcomes. DESIGN: Population based cohort study. SETTING: US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (US NHANES, 1988-94 and 1999-2014) and UK Biobank. PARTICIPANTS: 44 462 US adults aged 20 years or older and 399 537 UK adults aged 37-73 years. EXPOSURES: SES was derived by latent class analysis using family income, occupation or employment status, education level, and health insurance (US NHANES only), and three levels (low, medium, and high) were defined according to item response probabilities. A healthy lifestyle score was constructed using information on never smoking, no heavy alcohol consumption (women &#8804;1 drink/day; men &#8804;2 drinks/day; one drink contains 14 g of ethanol in the US and 8 g in the UK), top third of physical activity, and higher dietary quality. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All cause mortality was the primary outcome in both studies, and CVD mortality and morbidity in UK Biobank, which were obtained through linkage to registries. RESULTS: US NHANES documented 8906 deaths over a mean follow-up of 11.2 years, and UK Biobank documented 22 309 deaths and 6903 incident CVD cases over a mean follow-up of 8.8-11.0 years. Among adults of low SES, age adjusted risk of death was 22.5 (95% confidence interval 21.7 to 23.3) and 7.4 (7.3 to 7.6) per 1000 person years in US NHANES and UK Biobank, respectively, and age adjusted risk of CVD was 2.5 (2.4 to 2.6) per 1000 person years in UK Biobank. The corresponding risks among adults of high SES were 11.4 (10.6 to 12.1), 3.3 (3.1 to 3.5), and 1.4 (1.3 to 1.5) per 1000 person years. Compared with adults of high SES, those of low SES had higher risks of all cause mortality (hazard ratio 2.13, 95% confidence interval 1.90 to 2.38 in US NHANES; 1.96, 1.87 to 2.06 in UK Biobank), CVD mortality (2.25, 2.00 to 2.53), and incident CVD (1.65, 1.52 to 1.79) in UK Biobank, and the proportions mediated by lifestyle were 12.3% (10.7% to 13.9%), 4.0% (3.5% to 4.4%), 3.0% (2.5% to 3.6%), and 3.7% (3.1% to 4.5%), respectively. No significant interaction was observed between lifestyle and SES in US NHANES, whereas associations between lifestyle and outcomes were stronger among those of low SES in UK Biobank. Compared with adults of high SES and three or four healthy lifestyle factors, those with low SES and no or one healthy lifestyle factor had higher risks of all cause mortality (3.53, 3.01 to 4.14 in US NHANES; 2.65, 2.39 to 2.94 in UK Biobank), CVD mortality (2.65, 2.09 to 3.38), and incident CVD (2.09, 1.78 to 2.46) in UK Biobank. CONCLUSIONS: Unhealthy lifestyles mediated a small proportion of the socioeconomic inequity in health in both US and UK adults; therefore, healthy lifestyle promotion alone might not substantially reduce the socioeconomic inequity in health, and other measures tackling social determinants of health are warranted. Nevertheless, healthy lifestyles were associated with lower mortality and CVD risk in different SES subgroups, supporting an important role of healthy lifestyles in reducing disease burden.","Zhang, Yan-Bo; Chen, Chen; Pan, Xiong-Fei; Guo, Jingyu; Li, Yanping; Franco, Oscar H; Liu, Gang; Pan, An",BMJ,,438

The purpose of this study was to examine the association between two biomarkers, troponin-I (TN) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods: This is a retrospective single-center study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 2020 to May 2020. Elevated TN and IL-6 were defined as &gt;0.02 ng/ml and &gt;65.9 ng/mL respectively. The primary outcome was mortality with secondary outcomes including intensive care unit (ICU) admission and adverse cardiovascular outcomes (heart failure (HF), arrhythmia, myocardial infarction (MI), and pericarditis). Chi-squared tests and student t-tests were used for statistical analyses to examine the relationship between the presence of positive biomarkers and outcomes;p&lt;0.05 significant. Results: In total, 150 patients were identified with the majority being African American (70%), males (55%) and an average age of 63.7 years. Patients with elevated TN had significantly increased mortality rates (36.1% vs. 19.2%, OR 2.4, p=0.021), incidence of arrhythmias (15.3% vs. 1.3%, OR 13.9, p=0.002), incidence of HF (13.9% vs. 1.3%, OR 12.4, p=0.003), and incidence of MI (13.9% vs. 1.3%, OR 12.4, p=0.003). Patients with elevated IL-6 had significantly higher mortality rates (42.7% vs. 12.0%, OR 5.5, p=&lt;0.001), ICU admissions (50.7% vs. 18.7%, OR 4.5, p=&lt;0.0001), incidence of arrhythmias (13.3% vs. 2.7%, OR 5.6, p=0.016), incidence of HF (12.0% vs. 2.7%, OR 5.0, p=0.028), and incidence of MI (13.3% vs. 1.3%, OR 11.4, p= 0.0048). Conclusion: Myocardial injury evidenced by elevated TN and elevated IL-6 are predictive of severe COVID-19 infections and cardiovascular complications, irrespective of race as seen in this cohort. Early detection at hospital admission and perhaps subsequent monitoring of TN and IL-6 could be beneficial in triage and to identify potential early escalation of care.","Houle, M.; Dharia, I.; Roman, A.; Darwish, C.; Smith, S.; Zhang, S.; Krepp, J.; Gomberg-Maitland, M.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,438
435423,Colloids in rotating electric and magnetic fields: designing tunable interactions with spatial field hodographs,2020,"Growth and repair processes, both normal and pathological, require reciprocal interactions between cells and their microenvironment. Integrins are bidirectional, cell surface receptors that transduce mechanical and chemical signals to and from the extracellular matrix. We recently reported that keratinocyte &#945;3ß1 is required for interleukin (IL)-1&#945; secretion. Importantly, IL-1&#945; regulates fibroblast Cox-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ) secretion, thereby linking keratinocyte integrin function to a paracrine signal that suppresses the myofibroblast phenotype. We now report that fibroblast integrin &#945;4ß1 is required for this IL-1&#945;-induced, Cox-2 expression. Moreover, Cox-2 induction by IL-1&#945; requires Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), the master regulator of redox homeostasis; and integrin &#945;4ß1 is necessary to maintain IL-1&#945;-dependent, Nrf2 levels. Treating fibroblasts with a Nrf-2 activating compound inhibits TGF-ß-dependent, alpha smooth muscle actin (&#945;-SMA) expression and stress fibre formation. Our data suggest that fibroblast integrin &#945;4ß1 regulates-depending on microenvironmental cues-the differentiated state of fibroblasts through a signalling network in which IL-1&#945;, Cox-2 and Nrf2 participate.","Zheng, Rui; Varney, Scott D; Wu, Lei; DiPersio, C Michael; Van De Water, Livingston",Wound repair regen,,438

Factors contributing to higher SLS rates are unknown, and knowledge of SLS prevalence within oncologic training is lacking. SLS frequency was measured for evaluations from all Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited programs at a single cancer care institution between 2014 and 2018. SLS prevalence was estimated using hierarchical linear models (HLM) that considered characteristics of evaluator, trainee, and evaluation potentially related to SLS. Results were compared with national SLS rates. Six thousand one hundred sixty evaluations were included from 476 evaluators. Overall prevalence of SLS was 12.1% (95% CI 4.5-28.8). Residents (vs fellows) were less likely to have SLS evaluations (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.4-0.8), though for all trainees increasing training year corresponded with increasing SLS frequency (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.7). SLS was more common in procedural specialties compared with medical specialties (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-3.8). Formative evaluations had lower SLS rates (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.9) than summative evaluations, while milestone-based evaluations had higher rates than those that were not milestone-based (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.03-2.2). Features of evaluators, such as subspecialty within oncology, and of trainees, such as seniority or trainee type, were related to SLS. Summative intent and milestone-based evaluations were more likely to be straight line scored. Specific evaluation scenarios at higher risk of SLS should be further examined.","Hinchcliff, Emily; Gunther, Jillian; Ponnie, Annette Eakes; Bednarski, Brian; Onstad, Michaela; Shafer, Aaron; Frumovitz, Michael; Jazaeri, Amir; Urbauer, Diana; Bodurka, Diane C",J. cancer educ,,438

This study aimed to provide patient perspective data on how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs), using Twitter-based patient-generated health data (PGHD). METHODS: A convenience sample of Twitter messages in English posted by people with RMDs was extracted between March 1, and July 12, 2020 and examined using thematic analysis. Included were Twitter messages that mentioned keywords and hashtags related to both COVID-19 (or SARS-CoV-2) and select RMDs. The RMDs monitored included inflammatory-driven (joint) conditions (Ankylosing Spondylitis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, Lupus/Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, and Gout). RESULTS: The analysis included 569 tweets by 375 Twitter users with RMDs across several countries. Eight themes emerged regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with RMDs: (1) lack of understanding of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19; (2) critical changes in health behaviour; (3) challenges in healthcare practice and communication with healthcare professionals; (4) difficulties with access to medical care; (5) negative impact on physical and mental health, coping strategies; (6) issues around work participation, (7) negative effects of the media; (8) awareness-raising. CONCLUSION: The findings show that Twitter serves as a real-time data source to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with RMDs.

Various techniques have been applied in identification of SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 infection including computed tomography imaging, whole genome sequencing, and molecular methods such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This review article discusses the diagnostic methods currently being deployed for SARS-CoV-2 identification including optical biosensors and point-of-care diagnostics that are on the horizon. These innovative technologies may provide a more accurate, sensitive and rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 to manage the present novel coronavirus outbreak, and could be beneficial in preventing any future epidemics. Furthermore, the use of green synthesized nanomaterials in the optical biosensor devices could leads to sustainable and environmentally-friendly approaches for this crisis.","Ahmadi, Sepideh; Rabiee, Navid; Fatahi, Yousef; Hooshmand, Seyyed Emad; Bagherzadeh, Mojtaba; Rabiee, Mohammad; Jajarmi, Vahid; Dinarvand, Rassoul; Habibzadeh, Sajjad; Saeb, Mohammad Reza; Varma, Rajender S; Shokouhimehr, Mohammadreza; Hamblin, Michael R",Sustain Chem Pharm,,438
447942,Nanoplatforms for mRNA Therapeutics,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To identify predictors of clinical improvement and intubation/death in tocilizumab-treated severe COVID19, focusing on IL6 and CRP longitudinal monitoring. METHODS: 173 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia receiving tocilizumab in Reggio Emilia province Hospitals between 11 March and 3 June 2020 were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Clinical improvement was defined as status improvement on a six-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. A composite outcome of intubation/death was also evaluated. CRP and IL-6 levels were determined before TCZ administration (T0) and after 3 (T3), and 7 (T7) days. RESULTS: At multivariate analysis T0 and T3 CRP levels were negatively associated with clinical improvement (OR 0.13, CI 0.03-0.55 and OR 0.11, CI 0.0-0.46) (p=0.006 and p=0.003) and positively associated with intubation/death (OR 17.66, CI 2.47-126.14 and OR 5.34, CI: 1.49-19.12) (p=0.01 and p=0.004). No significant associations with IL-6 values were observed. General linear model analyses for repeated measures showed significantly different trends for CRP from day 3 to day 7 between patients who improved and those who did not, and between patients who were intubated or died and those who were not (p<0.0001 for both). ROC analysis identified a baseline CRP level of 15.8 mg/dl as the best cut-off to predict intubation/death (AUC = 0.711, sensitivity = 0.67, specificity = 0.71). CONCLUSIONS: CRP serial measurements in the first week of TCZ therapy are useful in identifying patients developing poor outcomes.","Cassone, Giulia; Dolci, Giovanni; Besutti, Giulia; Muratore, Francesco; Bajocchi, Gianluigi; Mancuso, Pamela; Catanoso, Mariagrazia; Spaggiari, Lucia; Galli, Elena; Palermo, Adalgisa; Pipitone, Nicolò; Croci, Stefania; Massari, Marco; Facciolongo, Nicola; Menzella, Francesco; Negri, Emanuele Alberto; Zerbini, Alessandro; Belloni, Lucia; Cimino, Luca; Teopompi, Elisabetta; Sampaolesi, Fabio; Salsi, Pierpaolo; Costantini, Massimo; Giorgi Rossi, Paolo; Aldigeri, Raffaella; Salvarani, Carlo",Clin Exp Rheumatol,,438
448049,Automatic clustering method to segment COVID-19 CT images,2021,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common manifestation among patients critically ill with SARS-CoV-2 infection (Coronavirus 2019) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The pathophysiology of renal failure in this context is not fully understood, but likely to be multifactorial. The intensive care unit outcomes of patients following COVID-19 acute critical illness with associated AKI have not been fully explored. We conducted a cohort study to investigate the risk factors for acute kidney injury in patients admitted to and intensive care unit with COVID-19, its incidence and associated outcomes. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of all patients admitted to our adult intensive care unit suffering from SARS-CoV-2 infection from 14th March 2020 until 12th May 2020. Acute kidney injury was defined using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) criteria. The outcome analysis was assessed up to date as 3rd of September 2020. RESULTS: A total of 81 patients admitted during this period. All patients had acute hypoxic respiratory failure and needed either noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilatory support. Thirty-six patients (44%) had evidence of AKI (Stage I-33%, Stage II-22%, Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT)-44%). All patients with AKI stage III had RRT. Age, diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, lymphopenia, high D-Dimer levels, increased APACHE II and SOFA scores, invasive mechanical ventilation and use of inotropic or vasopressor support were significantly associated with AKI. The peak AKI was at day 4 and mean duration of RRT was 12.5 days. The mortality was 25% for the AKI group compared to 6.7% in those without AKI. Among those received RRT and survived their illness, the renal function recovery is complete and back to baseline in all patients. CONCLUSION: Acute kidney injury and renal replacement therapy is common in critically ill patients presenting with COVID-19. It is associated with increased severity of illness on admission to ICU, increased mortality and prolonged ICU and hospital length of stay. Recovery of renal function was complete in all survived patients.","Lowe, R; Ferrari, M; Nasim-Mohi, M; Jackson, A; Beecham, R; Veighey, K; Cusack, R; Richardson, D; Grocott, Mpw; Levett, Dzh; Dushianthan, A",BMC Nephrol,,438
448514,Design and Development of a New Cost-Effective Internet of Things Sensor Platform for Air Quality Measurements,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted management of non-COVID-19 illnesses, including cancer. For many solid organ cancers, surgical intervention is imperative. We present our experience with major operations during a nationwide lockdown. METHOD: This was an observational study of 184 patients, analyzing their perioperative outcomes and categorizing morbidity according to Clavien-Dindo Classification. Strict screening required symptomatic patients to be referred to COVID centers and their operations postponed. Continuous and categorical variables were expressed as medians with range and frequencies and percentages, respectively. A two-sided &#945; < .05 was statistically significant. RESULTS: During the lockdown, we initiated a graded response over four phases: (I) 24 March to 14 April (18 procedures); (II) 15 April to 3 May (26 procedures); (III) 4 to 17 May (41 procedures); and (IV) 18 to 31 May (99 procedures). The rates of major perioperative morbidity were 10.9% and mortality 1.6%. Over the four phases, the major morbidity rates were 11.1%, 15.4%, 9.8%, and 13.1%. On multivariate analysis, an emergency procedure was the only significant factor associated with morbidity. During the study period, no hospital staff became symptomatic for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: In a region with milder impact of COVID-19, treatment of cancer patients need not be deferred. Our study showed that with appropriate precautions, asymptomatic patients may undergo operations without increased morbidity to them and hospital staff.","Pai, Esha; Chopra, Saumya; Mandloi, Deepak; Upadhyay, Arvind K; Prem, Amar; Pandey, Durgatosh",J. surg. oncol,,438

We investigated the adverse effect of ACEIs in diabetic and nondiabetic patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This prospective study consisted of 617 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 inpatients. Demographic and baseline characteristics, underlying comorbid diseases, and antihypertensive drugs were evaluated. Study outcome (in-hospital death) was evaluated with the Kaplan-Meyer method and Cox regression model. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software for Windows. P values < .05 were considered significant. RESULTS: Mean ± SD age was 58.49 ± 15.80 (range: 18 to 94) years old. Cox regression analysis revealed that age (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.06), diabetes mellitus (adjusted HR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.32 to 3.26), immunocompromised patients (adjusted HR = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.29 to 4.21), acute kidney injury (AKI) (adjusted HR = 3.23, 95% CI: 2.01 to 5.19), ICU admission (adjusted HR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.46 to 4.21), Asthma and COPD (adjusted HR = 2.13, CI:1.6 to 4.28) and ACEI (adjusted HR = 3.08, 95% CI: 1.56 to 6.06), respectively were associated with in-hospital death. Among diabetic patients, ACEI (adjusted HR = 3.51, 95% CI: 1.59 to 7.75), AKI (adjusted HR = 3.32, 95% CI: 1.76 to 6.45) and ICU admission (adjusted HR = 3.64, 95% CI: 1.530 to 8.65) were associated with increased mortality. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed a lower survival rate in diabetic patients with ACE inhibitor (adjusted HR = 3.36, 95% CI: 2.25 to 7.71). CONCLUSION: ACEIs may harm the diabetic patient's outcome with COVID-19. Further studies can confirm if ACE inhibitors have an adverse effect on COVID-19 diabetic patient's mortality.","Aghaaliakbari, Farshad; Abbasi, Mohammad Amin; Ranjbar, Mitra; Jamshidi Makiani, Mahin; Farrokhpour, Mohsen; Safarnezhad Tameshkel, Fahimeh; Karbalaie Niya, Mohammad Hadi; Doltkhah, Shahaboddin; Yaghoobzadeh, Khatereh; Savaj, Shokoufeh",Iran J Kidney Dis,,438

A large outbreak of diphtheria subsequently began in this population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data were collected during mass vaccination campaigns (MVCs), contact tracing activities, and from 9 Diphtheria Treatment Centers (DTCs) operated by national and international organizations. These data were used to describe the epidemiological and clinical features and the control measures to prevent transmission, during the first 2 years of the outbreak. Between November 10, 2017 and November 9, 2019, 7,064 cases were reported: 285 (4.0%) laboratory-confirmed, 3,610 (51.1%) probable, and 3,169 (44.9%) suspected cases. The crude attack rate was 51.5 cases per 10,000 person-years, and epidemic doubling time was 4.4 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.2-4.7) during the exponential growth phase. The median age was 10 years (range 0-85), and 3,126 (44.3%) were male. The typical symptoms were sore throat (93.5%), fever (86.0%), pseudomembrane (34.7%), and gross cervical lymphadenopathy (GCL; 30.6%). Diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) was administered to 1,062 (89.0%) out of 1,193 eligible patients, with adverse reactions following among 229 (21.6%). There were 45 deaths (case fatality ratio [CFR] 0.6%). Household contacts for 5,702 (80.7%) of 7,064 cases were successfully traced. A total of 41,452 contacts were identified, of whom 40,364 (97.4%) consented to begin chemoprophylaxis; adherence was 55.0% (N = 22,218) at 3-day follow-up. Unvaccinated household contacts were vaccinated with 3 doses (with 4-week interval), while a booster dose was administered if the primary vaccination schedule had been completed. The proportion of contacts vaccinated was 64.7% overall. Three MVC rounds were conducted, with administrative coverage varying between 88.5% and 110.4%. Pentavalent vaccine was administered to those aged 6 weeks to 6 years, while tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine was administered to those aged 7 years and older. Lack of adequate diagnostic capacity to confirm cases was the main limitation, with a majority of cases unconfirmed and the proportion of true diphtheria cases unknown. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest reported diphtheria outbreak in refugee settings. We observed that high population density, poor living conditions, and fast growth rate were associated with explosive expansion of the outbreak during the initial exponential growth phase. Three rounds of mass vaccinations targeting those aged 6 weeks to 14 years were associated with only modestly reduced transmission, and additional public health measures were necessary to end the outbreak. This outbreak has a long-lasting tail, with Rt oscillating at around 1 for an extended period. An adequate global DAT stockpile needs to be maintained. All populations must have access to health services and routine vaccination, and this access must be maintained during humanitarian crises.","Polonsky, Jonathan A; Ivey, Melissa; Mazhar, Md Khadimul Anam; Rahman, Ziaur; le Polain de Waroux, Olivier; Karo, Basel; Jalava, Katri; Vong, Sirenda; Baidjoe, Amrish; Diaz, Janet; Finger, Flavio; Habib, Zakir H; Halder, Charls Erik; Haskew, Christopher; Kaiser, Laurent; Khan, Ali S; Sangal, Lucky; Shirin, Tahmina; Zaki, Quazi Ahmed; Salam, Md Abdus; White, Kate",PLoS Med,,438

Papers in this proceeding were presented in the 7th International Conference on Geomatics and Geospatial Technology 2021 or GGT2021. This year conference jointly organised by Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) and Royal Institution of Surveyor Malaysia (RISM) was held virtually as many other international conferences in the era of the pandemic. Geospatial Technology for Sustainable Development has been chosen for this year theme to unlock further the potential use of geospatial for leveraging sustainable development. The topics covered include Surveying and Geomatics, GPS and GNSS, Remote Sensing, LiDAR, UAV, 2D and 3D GIS, disaster management, flood modelling and many more. GGT2021 was supposedly held as GGT2020 on 21 – 24 September 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic last year, the conference was postponed to 2021. The Movement Control Order (MCO) issued by the Malaysian government had prohibited any gathering including for meetings, seminars and conferences. In addition, there are travel restrictions not only for international but also domestic travel. Travel between different states and districts in Malaysia is prohibited. Since, the conference’s participants came from all over the world, even more than half of the local participants need to travel inter-state or inter-district to attend the conference, the organizer decided to change the conference to a virtual format. If the organizer decided to wait for the government decisions to lift those restrictions, it will be unclear when the conference can be held. Thanks to that, GGT2021 was conducted, virtually, on 23 – 24 March 2021. We would like thanks all the reviewers who have provided constructive comments and suggestions to the abstracts and papers assigned to them. We have received 59 submissions for the papers and 49 quality papers from 9 countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia, Italy, Russia, United States, Algeria and a few more were accepted. Again, thanks to 52 expert reviewers around the globe. Lastly, we would like to give a big applause and thanks to all the authors for their presentations and papers.

454981,Nonlinear time series and principal component analysis: A potential diagnostic tool for COVID-19 auscultation,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (CO-VID-19) infection is an ongoing pandemic and worldwide health emergency that has caused important changes in healthcare systems. Previous studies reported an increased risk of thromboembolic events, including stroke. This systematic review aims to describe the clinical features and etiological characteristics of ischemic stroke patients with CO-VID-19 infection. METHOD: A literature search was performed in principal databases for studies and case reports containing data concerning risk factors, clinical features, and etiological characteristics of patients infected with COVID-19 and suffering from stroke. Descriptive and analytical statistics were applied. RESULTS: Overall, 14 articles were included for a total of 93 patients. Median age was 65 (IQR: 55-75) years with prevalence in males. Stroke occurred after a median of 6 days from COVID-19 infection diagnosis. Median National of Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 19. Cryptogenic (Cry) strokes were more frequent (51.8%), followed by cardioembolic etiology, and they occurred a long time after COVID-19 diagnosis compared with large-artery atherosclerosis strokes (ptrend: 0.03). The clinical severity of stroke was significantly associated with the severity grade of COVID-19 infection (ptrend: 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic strokes in COVID-19-infected patients were clinically severe, affecting younger patients mainly with Cry and cardioembolic etiologies. Further multicenter prospective registries are needed to better describe the causal association and the effect of COVID-19 infection on stroke.","Vidale, Simone",Cerebrovasc Dis,,438

461008,Early COVID-19 symptoms identification using hybrid unsupervised machine learning techniques,2021,"Understanding the immune responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical in terms of protection against reinfection and, thus, for public health policy and vaccine development for COVID-19. In this study, using either live SARS-CoV-2 particles or retroviruses pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 S viral surface protein (Spike), we studied the neutralizing antibody (nAb) response in serum samples from a cohort of 140 SARS-CoV-2 qPCR-confirmed infections, including patients with mild symptoms and also more severe forms, including those that required intensive care. We show that nAb titers correlated strongly with disease severity and with anti-spike IgG levels. Indeed, patients from intensive care units exhibited high nAb titers; conversely, patients with milder disease symptoms had heterogeneous nAb titers, and asymptomatic or exclusive outpatient-care patients had no or low nAbs. We found that nAb activity in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients displayed a relatively rapid decline after recovery compared to individuals infected with other coronaviruses. Moreover, we found an absence of cross-neutralization between endemic coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, indicating that previous infection by human coronaviruses may not generate protective nAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we found that the D614G mutation in the spike protein, which has recently been identified as the current major variant in Europe, does not allow neutralization escape. Altogether, our results contribute to our understanding of the immune correlates of SARS-CoV-2-induced disease, and rapid evaluation of the role of the humoral response in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is warranted.","Legros, Vincent; Denolly, Solène; Vogrig, Manon; Boson, Bertrand; Siret, Eglantine; Rigaill, Josselin; Pillet, Sylvie; Grattard, Florence; Gonzalo, Sylvie; Verhoeven, Paul; Allatif, Omran; Berthelot, Philippe; Pélissier, Carole; Thiery, Guillaume; Botelho-Nevers, Elisabeth; Millet, Guillaume; Morel, Jérôme; Paul, Stéphane; Walzer, Thierry; Cosset, François-Loïc; Bourlet, Thomas; Pozzetto, Bruno",Cell. mol. immunol.

461398,COVID-19 Influence and Future Perspectives of Artificial Intelligence on the Labour Market,2020,"The following article was written after the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. On reflection of clinical practice during this time, it was noted by the ICU team that the majority of ventilated patients appeared to have lost weight during their stay. Unfortunately, there was no ability to weigh patients during the pandemic, so this weight loss was a subjective observation. Regardless, this observation lead the ICU dietitian to retrospectively audit prescribed versus delivered feed. It was found that only 10% of admissions received the prescribed daily volume of feed within the first 7 days of admission. A further 6% of admissions were within 10% of achieving daily prescribed target volumes. The main reasons for this were proning patients, high gastric residual volumes and the overwhelming nature of the pandemic. Three areas of practice have been highlighted that will improve feed delivery should a second wave occur. 1. A nasojejunal team comprising 20 members of the ICU multidiciplinary team will be established to insert bedside nasojejunal tubes in all ICU patients on admission. 2. All proned patients will be enterally fed and practice adjusted as per British Dietetic Association recommendations. 3. The international enteral feeding guidelines regarding hypocaloric feeding for the first 7 days will not be followed due to minimal clinical evidence for the ICU COVID-19 demographic.","Delaney, Emer",Br J Nurs,,438

This population-based study was carried out in order to ascertain whether there were any differences in numbers or characteristics of acute paediatric medical admissions during the first wave of COVID-19 in Malta compared with the corresponding 2019 period. METHODS: Data was collected from Maltas only acute general hospital using health records and computer databases including iSoft Clinical Manager (ICM) and Electronic Case Summaries (ECS). Data was collected for 1/3-9/5/2019 (control period) and the corresponding 2020 period (study period). RESULTS: Acute paediatric medical admissions dropped by 63.5%. Neonates increased by 5.25% (p = 0.001). An increase in child abuse/social paediatric cases (p < 0.001) was noted. Data analysed after school closure revealed a significant drop in the number of communicable (infectious) disease admissions (p < 0.001). There was also a negative correlation between daily paediatric admissions and active COVID-19 cases in Malta (p = 0.005). No significant delay in the presentation of patients was noted and no increased admissions to the NPICU was recorded.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of HCQ in addition to standard of care (SOC) in COVID-19. PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of sciences, and medRxiv were searched up to March 15, 2021. Clinical studies registry databases were also searched for identifying potential clinical trials. The references list of the key studies was reviewed to identify additional relevant resources. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration tool and Jadad checklist. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan software (version 5.3). Eleven randomized controlled trials with a total number of 8161 patients were identified as eligible for meta-analysis. No significant differences were observed between the two treatment groups in terms of negative rate of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Risk ratio [RR]: 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90, 1.08; P = 0.76), PCR negative conversion time (Mean difference [MD]: - 1.06, 95% CI - 3.10, 0.97; P = 0.30), all-cause mortality (RR: 1.09, 95% CI 1.00, 1.20; P = 0.06), body temperature recovery time (MD: - 0.64, 95% CI - 1.37, 0.10; P = 0.09), length of hospital stay (MD: - 0.17, 95% CI - 0.80, 0.46; P = 0.59), use of mechanical ventilation (RR: 1.12, 95% CI 0.95, 1.32; P = 0.19), and disease progression (RR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.37, 1.85; P = 0.64). However, there was a significant difference between two groups regarding adverse events (RR: 1.81, 95% CI 1.36, 2.42; P < 0.05). The findings suggest that the addition of HCQ to SOC has no benefit in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

464673,Few-Shot Object Detection in Real Life: Case Study on Auto-Harvest,2020,"Background and Objectives: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a disease with a complex pathophysiology involving immune-mediated reactions that lead to skin lesions that are typically localized and recurrent. Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, attempting to assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on diseases caused by complex immune mechanisms has become important. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the course of AD, including immunosuppressive therapy, in patients with a severe form of the disease. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 21 adults aged 18 to 52 years with AD diagnosed with COVID-19, including patients requiring hospitalization, was performed. Results: During SARS-CoV-2 infection, temporary exacerbation of skin lesions and/or skin pruritus was observed in nine (43%) patients but without the need for systemic treatment intervention. Patients with severe AD who received immunosuppressive therapy most often manifested mild exacerbation of skin symptoms. The skin condition improved in three patients. There was no significant effect of disease severity on the risk of severe COVID-19 (HR = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.32-0.65). Conclusions: The course of atopic dermatitis during SARS-CoV-2 infection may be different from the severity of its symptoms due to the lack of a significant influence. The immunosuppressive treatment used in patients with severe AD did not significantly affect the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Miodonska, Martyna; Bogacz, Agnieszka; Mróz, Magdalena; Mucka, Szymon; Bozek, Andrzej",Medicina (Kaunas),,438

The aims of this study were to explore the impacts of COVID 19 on the students' perceptions of readiness for practice and their preparation for the NCLEX exam and initial clinical practice. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive design was used to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on senior BSN students' preparation for NCLEX and future careers. The Casey-Fink Readiness for Practice Survey was used to investigate the perceptions of the BSN students' clinical confidence and readiness for practice. RESULTS: Students reported substantial impacts of COVID-19 on their clinical experiences, their ability to practice skills and procedures, their preparations for NCLEX exam, and their nursing career. The most significant confidence concerns noted from this study seemed to center on handling multiple patient assignments, calling the physician, responding to a change in patient condition, and treating a dying patient. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare experts expect that the impact of COVID-19 may last until 2022. More research is needed to understand the impact of COVID-19 on nursing education and transition to nursing practice. While clinical confidence and readiness for practice are essential topics, more research is needed to investigate the psychological and physiological impacts of COVID-19 on nurses, nursing students, nursing preceptors, and faculty members.","Musallam, Eyad; A Flinders, Brooke",Int. j. nurs. educ. scholarsh,,438

466819,An effective online collaborative training in developing listening comprehension skills,2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will be deployed to countries with limited immunization systems. METHODS: We assessed the effect of deploying SARS-Cov-2 vaccines on cold storage capacity and immunization workload in a simulated WHO African Region country using region-specific data on immunization, population, healthcare workers (HCWs), cold storage capacity (quartile values for national and subnational levels), and characteristics of an approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. We calculated monthly increases in vaccine doses, doses per vaccinator, and cold storage volumes for four-month SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns targeting risk groups compared to routine immunization baselines. RESULTS: Administering SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to risk groups would increase total monthly doses by 27.0% for &#8805; 65 years, 91.7% for chronic diseases patients, and 1.1% for HCWs. Assuming median nurse density estimates adjusted for absenteeism and proportion providing immunization services, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would increase total monthly doses per vaccinator by 29.3% for &#8805; 65 years, 99.6% for chronic diseases patients, and 1.2% for HCWs. When we applied quartiles of actual African Region country vaccine storage capacity, routine immunization vaccine volumes exceeded national-level storage capacity for at least 75% of countries, but subnational levels had sufficient storage capacity for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for at least 75% of countries. CONCLUSIONS: In the WHO African Region, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would substantially increase doses per vaccinator and cold storage capacity requirements over routine immunization baselines. Pandemic vaccination campaigns would increase storage requirements of national-level stores already at their limits, but sufficient capacity exists at subnational levels. Immediate attention to strengthening immunization systems is essential to support pandemic responses.","Ortiz, Justin R; Robertson, Joanie; Hsu, Jui-Shan; Yu, Stephen L; Driscoll, Amanda J; Williams, Sarah R; Chen, Wilbur H; Fitzpatrick, Meagan C; Sow, Samba; Biellik, Robin J; Neuzil, Kathleen M",Vaccine,,438

Enacting solidarity drives progress in research and clinical practice. At the same time, such acts of sharing could-especially considering current developments in big data and artificial intelligence-compromise the right by leading to injustices and affecting concrete modes of individual self-determination. In order to address this potential tension, two key elements for ethical reflection on data-driven medicine are proposed: the controllability of information flows, including technical infrastructures that are conducive towards controllability, and a paradigm shift towards output-orientation in governance and policy.","Hummel, Patrik; Braun, Matthias",Life Sci Soc Policy,,438

Due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) and recommendations for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), prehospital care procedures need to be re-evaluated. The objective of this study was to determine how the use of PPE influences the amount of preparation time needed before beginning actual resuscitation and the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR; QCPR) on an IRB. METHODS: Three CPR tests were performed by 14 lifeguards, in teams of two, wearing different PPE: (1) Basic PPE (B-PPE): gloves, a mask, and protective glasses; (2) Full PPE (F-PPE): B-PPE + a waterproof apron; and (3) Basic PPE + plastic blanket (B+PPE). On-boat resuscitation using a bag-valve-mask (BVM) and high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter was performed sailing at 20km/hour. RESULTS: Using B-PPE takes less time and is significantly faster than F-PPE (B-PPE 17 [SD = 2] seconds versus F-PPE 69 [SD = 17] seconds; P = .001), and the use of B+PPE is slightly higher (B-PPE 17 [SD = 2] seconds versus B+PPE 34 [SD = 6] seconds; P = .002). The QCPR remained similar in all three scenarios (P >.05), reaching values over 79%. CONCLUSION: The use of PPE during on-board resuscitation is feasible and does not interfere with quality when performed by trained lifeguards. The use of a plastic blanket could be a quick and easy alternative to offer extra protection to lifeguards during CPR on an IRB.","Barcala-Furelos, Roberto; Abelairas-Gómez, Cristian; Alonso-Calvete, Alejandra; Cano-Noguera, Francisco; Carballo-Fazanes, Aida; Martínez-Isasi, Santiago; Rodríguez-Núñez, Antonio",Prehosp Disaster Med,,438

The study is based on two repeated measurements conducted at the end of the pandemic's ""first wave"" and the beginning of the ""second wave"" on a sample (n = 906) of Jewish Israeli respondents, who completed an online questionnaire distributed by an Internet panel company. Three groups of indicators were assessed: signs of distress (sense of danger, distress symptoms, and perceived threats), resilience (individual, community, and national), and subjective well-being (well-being, hope, and morale). Results indicated the following: (a) a significant increase in distress indicators, with effect sizes of sense of danger, distress symptoms, and perceived threats (Cohen's d 0.614, 0.120, and 0.248, respectively); (b) a significant decrease in resilience indicators, with effect sizes of individual, community, and national resilience (Cohen's d 0.153, 0.428, and 0.793, respectively); and (c) a significant decrease in subjective well-being indicators with effect sizes of well-being, hope, and morale (Cohen's d 0.116, 0.336, and 0.199, respectively). To conclude, COVID-19 had a severe, large-scale impact on the civil society, leading to multidimensional damage and a marked decrease in the individual, community, and national resilience of the population.","Kimhi, Shaul; Eshel, Yohanan; Marciano, Hadas; Adini, Bruria",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,438

The model divided a community in subpopulations comprised by young and elder persons, in order to take into account higher risk of fatality among elder persons with severe CoViD-19. From data collected in the S\~ao Paulo State, we estimated the transmission and additional mortality rates, from which we calculated the basic reproduction number R0. From estimated parameters, estimation of the deaths due to CoViD-19 was three times lower than those found in literature. Considering isolation as a control mechanism, we varied isolation rates of young and elder persons in order to assess their epidemiological impacts. The epidemiological scenarios focused mainly on evaluating the number of severe CoViD-19 cases and deaths due to this disease when isolation is introduced in a population.","Yang, Hyun Mo; Junior, Luis Pedro Lombardi; Yang, Ariana Campos",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05715v1.pdf,438

A Step toward Stimulating Circular Bio-Economy in Poland",2020,"OBJECTIVES: Recent studies have demonstrated that first-line nurses involved in the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) crisis may experience sleep disturbances. As breathing relaxation techniques can improve sleep quality, anxiety, and depression, the current study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of diaphragmatic breathing relaxation training (DBRT) for improving sleep quality among nurses in Wuhan, China during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This study used a quasi-experimental (before and after) intervention strategy, with 151 first-line nurses from four wards in Leishenshan hospital. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) to evaluate the effectiveness of DBRT before and after the intervention. Data were examined using the Shapiro-Wilk test, Levene's test, and paired t-test. RESULTS: A total of 140 nurses completed the DBRT sessions. First-line nurses achieved significant reductions in global sleep quality (p < 0.01), subjective sleep quality (p < 0.001), sleep latency (p < 0.01), sleep duration (p < 0.001), sleep disturbances (p < 0.001), habitual sleep efficiency (p = 0.015), daytime dysfunction (p = 0.001), and anxiety (p = 0.001). There were no significant reductions in the use of sleeping medication (p = 0.134) and depression (p = 0.359). CONCLUSION: DBRT is a useful non-pharmacological treatment for improving sleep quality and reducing anxiety among first-line nurses involved in the COVID-19 outbreak. The study protocol was clinically registered by the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry.

480351,On the Coherence of Fake News Articles,2019-06-26,"INTRODUCTION: Several SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays have been developed recently. The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of five immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. METHODS: Two quantitative automated immunoassays (Maglumi&#8482;2019-n-Cov IgG and IgM and Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA assays) and three lateral flow rapid tests were performed. This retrospective study included 200 residual sera from patients and healthy volunteers. Case serum samples (n = 128) were obtained from COVID-19 patients confirmed by RT-qPCR and CT-scan. Days since onset of symptoms was collected from their medical records. Control non-SARS-CoV-2 samples (n = 72) were obtained from anonymous stored residual serum samples. RESULTS: Maglumi&#8482; IgG/IgM tests showed overall less sensitivity than Euroimmun IgG/IgA test (84.4 % versus 64.3 %). Both tests showed similar specificities of IgG at 99 % and 100 %, respectively. The results from the lateral flow assays were easily interpretable with unambiguous coloured reading bands. The overall sensitivity of the three tests was similar (around 70 %) without any significant differences. The sensitivity of the three lateral flow assays and also of the serological quantitative assays increased during the second week after symptom onset and all reached similar values (91 %-94 %) after 14 days. CONCLUSION: This study shows accurate and equivalent performance of the five serological antibody assays (ELISA, CLIA and three lateral flow tests) in detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 14 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. This is compatible with their application in specific clinical contexts and in determining epidemiological strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic.","Montesinos, Isabel; Gruson, Damien; Kabamba, Benoit; Dahma, Hafid; Van den Wijngaert, Sigi; Reza, Soleimani; Carbone, Vincenzo; Vandenberg, Olivier; Gulbis, Beatrice; Wolff, Fleur; Rodriguez-Villalobos, Hector",J Clin Virol,,438
481023,An Internet of Medical Things-Enabled Edge Computing Framework for Tackling COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Despite the trend of rising Emergency Department (ED) visits over the past decade, researchers have observed drastic declines in number of ED visits due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of the current study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and governor mandated Stay at Home Order on ED super utilizers. METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of patients presenting to the 12 emergency departments of the Franciscan Mission of Our Lady Hospital System in Louisiana between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2020. Patients who were 18 years of age or older and had four ED visits within a one-year period (2018, 2019, or 2020) were classified as super-utilizers. We examined number and category of visits for the baseline period (January 2018 - March 2020), the governor's Stay at Home Order, and the subsequent Reopening Phases through December 31, 2020. RESULTS: The number of visits by super utilizers decreased by over 16% when the Stay at Home Order was issued. The average number of visits per week rose from 1010.63 during the Stay at Home Order to 1198.09 after the Stay at Home Order was lifted, but they did not return to Pre-COVID levels of approximately 1400 visits per week in 2018 and 2019. When categories of visits were examined, this trend was found for emergent visits (p < 0.001) and visits related to injuries (p < 0.001). Non-emergent visits declined during the Stay at Home Order compared to the baseline period (p < 0.001), and did not increase significantly during reopening compared to the Stay at Home Order (p = 0.87). There were no changes in number of visits for psychiatric purposes, alcohol use, or drug use during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Significant declines in emergent visits raise concerns that individuals who needed ED treatment did not seek it due to COVID-19. However, the finding that super utilizers with non-emergent visits continued to visit the ED less after the Stay at Home Order was lifted raises questions for future research that may inform policy and interventions for inappropriate ED use.","Alwood, Shannon; Musso, Mandi W; Jones, Glenn N; Mosley, Joel; Wippel, Brittany; Theriot, Lauren; Hamer, Diana",Am J Emerg Med,,438

The ongoing provision of major trauma services during this time has proved challenging. We report our experience of managing open lower limb fractures (oLLFs) during the pandemic in a London major trauma centre (MTC). METHODS: This was a prospective study of all open lower limb fractures presenting to our unit over the initial 48 days of UK government lockdown - 24th March till 10th May 2020. Results were compared to the same time period in 2019 retrospectively. Epidemiological data, mechanism, Gustilo-Anderson (G-A) severity grading, time to initial debridement and definitive coverage were analysed. RESULTS: There was a 64% reduction in emergency department (ED) attendances (25,264 vs 9042). There was an 18% reduction in oLLFs (22 vs 18). Approximately three-quarters of injuries were in males across both cohorts (77% vs 78%) and tended to occur in younger patients (median age, 37 vs 35). Road-traffic-accidents (RTAs) were the most common injury mechanism in both 2019 and lockdown, but a rise in jumpers from height was seen in the latter. A similar pattern of G-A severities were seen, however only 3 injuries during lockdown required major soft tissue reconstruction. There was no significant difference in times taken for initial debridement (p = 0.72786) or definitive wound coverage (p = 0.16152). A greater proportion of independent operating was seen during lockdown between orthopaedics and plastic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Despite government lockdown measures, oLLFs still placed significant burden on our MTC. Notwithstanding significant staffing alterations and theatre pressures, we have been able to ensure these lower limb emergencies remain a surgical priority and have managed to utilise resources appropriately.","Campbell, E; Zahoor, U; Payne, A; Popova, D; Welman, T; Pahal, G S; Sadigh, P",Injury,,438

Currently, there are no markers to guide antithrombotic therapy in Covid-19. Immature platelets represent a population of hyper-reactive platelets associated with arterial events. This prospective study compared consecutive Covid-19 patients (n = 47, median age = 56 years) to patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI, n = 100, median age = 59 years) and a group of stable patients with cardiovascular risk factors (n = 64, median age = 68 years). Immature platelet fraction (IPF) and immature platelet count (IPC) were determined by the Sysmex XN-3000 auto-analyzer on admission and at subsequent time-points. IPF% on admission was higher in Covid-19 than the stable group and similar to the AMI group (4.8% [IQR 3.4-6.9], 3.5% [2.7-5.1], 4.55% [3.0-6.75], respectively, p = 0.0053).

Lockdown with effective closure of all services including routine health care services has tested the nerves of health care providers for finding novel ways of providing services without getting into the risk of exposure. Telemedicine had been an ideal option for such situations allowing all channels of communication that leverage Information Technology platforms, including voice, audio, text and digital data exchange as a help to diagnosis, prescription and follow up evaluation. Unfortunately this versatility of Telemedicine as a patient -physician interface could not be harnessed well for its technical complexities and unpreparedness of institutions and individuals. Smartphone based video calling using whatsapp messenger has been proposed as a feasible Telemedicine application to provide outpatient services in this scenario. A pilot run of outpatient services during lockdown period through whatsapp facilitated video calling at Ayurveda Gathiya Clinic, State Ayurvedic College and Hospital, Lucknow has shown a way forward of running such services with a mass appeal, ease of operation and high interface gratification among users and service providers.

The shift to remote learning has required parents with preschool-age children to adapt to new ways of collaborating with teachers. Given the longstanding inequities in the education of children from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, exacerbated by the pandemic, it is critical to learn about the challenges that parents encountered and how they supported their children's learning. This knowledge will help to identify ways to better serve these communities during times of crisis and beyond. This study examined how Latinx parents from low-income backgrounds engaged in their children's early education during the COVID-19 crisis. The term Latinx is used in an effort to be gender inclusive when referring to people of Latin American descent. We explored: 1) How do Latinx parents perceive and apply teachers' suggested activities to support children's learning during the early childhood education program closure? 2) What parent and child-initiated learning opportunities do parents report? 3) What challenges with remote learning do parents encounter? Twenty parents of preschoolers in a mountain state metropolitan area participated in a 30-45 min. phone interview. All parents spoke Spanish at home to a different degree. Findings revealed the emergence of more authentic parent-teacher partnerships and parents' extensive engagement in teacher-suggested activities. Importantly, families created a variety of practices to support children's learning and well-being. Yet, a vast majority of parents expressed feeling stressed with the demands of remote education, particularly keeping their child interested in remote learning. Implications for home-school partnerships are discussed.

489493,Research Resiliency through Lean Labs,2020,"Purpose of Review: This review instantiates the efficacy and safety of HFNC in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. Recent Findings: Globally, the healthcare system is facing an unprecedented crisis of resources due to the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, and pneumonia are the most common symptoms associated with it. The incidence of invasive mechanical ventilation in ICU patients ranges from 29.1 to 89.9%. Supplemental oxygen therapy is the main stay treatment for managing hypoxemic respiratory failure. The high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a novel non-invasive strategy for better oxygenation and ventilation in critically ill patients. In this grim scenario, a reduction in mechanical ventilation by means of HFNC is of prime interest. Summary: HFNC is considered an aerosol-generating intervention with the risk of viral aerosolization with a concern of potential nosocomial transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, there is no consensus regarding the use of HFNC in novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP). HFNC seems to be an effective and safe treatment modality in acute respiratory failure with optimal settings and selection of ideal patients.","Singh, Abhishek; Khanna, Puneet; Sarkar, Soumya",Curr Anesthesiol Rep,,438

490409,Empowering the workforce in post–covid-19 smart manufacturing systems,2020,"BACKGROUND: To date, more than thirty animals were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, all of them infected by humans with COVID-19. Some animal experiments suggested the possibility of an animal to animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and were seen in some cases of infected animals. Animal to human transmission was considered unlikely until investigations revealed the possibility of mink to human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands. OBJECTIVE: Current study aims at highlighting the predominance of SARS-CoV-2 infection in various animal species, reverse zoonotic transmission and proposing possible animal models that might aid in study and development of vaccine against Covid-19. METHODS: The authors have gathered information on various animal species infected with SARS-CoV-2 and possible tests conducted from online news reports, websites and Scopus indexed journals. RESULTS: Studying the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to domestic animals concluded that pigs, chicken, and ducks were not vulnerable to Covid-19; dogs showed less susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and cats as well as ferrets were seen susceptible to Covid-19. SARS-CoV-2 is seen crossing the species barrier, infecting humans from the wild with the source yet unclear, spreading from humans to humans quickly, humans to animals, animals to animals, and is likely to spread from animals to humans even though minimally. Animals appear somewhat resistant to SARS-CoV-2 transmission compared to humans who globally crossed eight million infection cases, and the infected animals mostly do not show many complications and recover quickly. CONCLUSION: Precautions are advised to prevent human to animal transmission of the virus, and in some areas, avoid animal to human spread of the virus. Further monitoring is required to assess the SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals as COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving condition worldwide. Cats and ferrets have physiological resemblance and genome sequencing studies propose the possibility of these species to be used as animal models for investigating the SARS-CoV-2 infection and this might aid in further studies and vaccine development against Covid-19.","Kumar, Rajesh; Harilal, Seetha; Al-Sehemi, Abdullah G; Paninipara, Mehboobali; Behl, Tapan; Mathew, Githa Elizabeth; Mathew, Bijo",Curr. pharm. des,,438
490759,Implementation of a Virtual Assistant for the Academic Management of a University with the Use of Artificial Intelligence,2021,"The rapidly growing body of structural and biochemical studies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein has revealed a variety of distinct functional states with radically different arrangements of the receptor-binding domain, highlighting a remarkable function-driven conformational plasticity and adaptability of the spike proteins. In this study, we examined molecular mechanisms underlying conformational and dynamic changes in the SARS-CoV-2 spike mutant trimers through the lens of dynamic analysis of allosteric interaction networks and atomistic modeling of signal transmission. Using an integrated approach that combined coarse-grained molecular simulations, protein stability analysis, and perturbation-based modeling of residue interaction networks, we examined how mutations in the regulatory regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can differentially affect dynamics and allosteric signaling in distinct functional states. The results of this study revealed key functional regions and regulatory centers that govern collective dynamics, allosteric interactions, and control signal transmission in the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. We found that the experimentally confirmed regulatory hotspots that dictate dynamic switching between conformational states of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein correspond to the key hinge sites and global mediating centers of the allosteric interaction networks. The results of this study provide a novel insight into allosteric regulatory mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins showing that mutations at the key regulatory positions can differentially modulate distribution of states and determine topography of signal communication pathways operating through state-specific cascades of control switch points. This analysis provides a plausible strategy for allosteric probing of the conformational equilibrium and therapeutic intervention by targeting specific hotspots of allosteric interactions and communications in the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins.","Verkhivker, Gennady M; Di Paola, Luisa",J Phys Chem B,,438

Aquatic environments, lakes, rivers and ponds, are important habitats for bats and birds, which are hosts for various coronavirus species and strains and which shed viral particles in their feces. It is therefore of high interest to fully explore the role that aquatic environments may play in coronavirus spread, including cross-species transmissions. Besides the respiratory tract, coronaviruses pathogenic to humans can also infect the digestive system and be subsequently defecated. Considering this, it is pivotal to understand whether wastewater can play a role in their dissemination, particularly in areas with poor sanitation. This review provides an overview of the taxonomy, molecular biology, natural reservoirs and pathogenicity of coronaviruses; outlines their potential to survive in aquatic environments and wastewater; and demonstrates their association with aquatic biota, mainly waterfowl. It also calls for further, interdisciplinary research in the field of aquatic virology to explore the potential hotspots of coronaviruses in the aquatic environment and the routes through which they may enter it.","Wartecki, Adrian; Rzymski, Piotr",Water,,438

494248,COVID-19 classification using feature based deep learning approach,2021,"The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is an emerging target in the field of alcohol research. The MR is a steroid receptor in the same family as the glucocorticoid receptor, with which it shares the ligand corticosterone in addition to the MR selective ligand aldosterone. Recent studies have shown correlations between central amygdala (CeA) MR expression and alcohol drinking in rats and macaques, as well as correlations between aldosterone and alcohol craving in individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD). Additionally, our previous work demonstrated that systemic treatment with the MR antagonist spironolactone reduced alcohol self-administration and response persistence in both male and female rats. This study examined if reductions in self-administration following MR antagonist treatment were related to dysregulation of MR-mediated corticosterone negative feedback. Female rats treated with spironolactone (50 mg/kg; IP) showed increased plasma corticosterone following self-administration, which correlated with reduced alcohol self-administration. Next, local microinjection of the MR-selective antagonist eplerenone was used to identify the brain-regional locus of MR action on alcohol self-administration. Eplerenone infusion produced dose-dependent reductions in alcohol self-administration in the CeA, but had no effect in the dorsal hippocampus. Finally, to assay the functional role of CeA MR expression in alcohol self-administration, CeA MR was knocked down by antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) infusion prior to alcohol self-administration. Rats showed a transient reduction in alcohol self-administration 1 day after ASO infusion. Together these studies demonstrate a functional role of CeA MR in modulating alcohol self-administration and make a case for studying MR antagonists as a novel treatment for AUD.","Makhijani, Viren H; Irukulapati, Preethi; Van Voorhies, Kalynn; Fortino, Brayden; Besheer, Joyce",Neuropharmacology,,438
495708,A Simplistic Machine Learning Approach to Contact Tracing,2020-12-10,"Original molecular vectors that ensure broad flexibility to tune the shape and surface properties of plasmid DNA (pDNA) condensates are reported herein. The prototypic design involves a cyclodextrin (CD) platform bearing a polycationic cluster at the primary face and a doubly linked aromatic module bridging two consecutive monosaccharide units at the secondary face that behaves as a topology-encoding element. Subtle differences at the molecular level then translate into disparate morphologies at the nanoscale, including rods, worms, toroids, globules, ellipsoids, and spheroids. In vitro evaluation of the transfection capabilities revealed marked selectivity differences as a function of nanocomplex morphology. Remarkably high transfection efficiencies were associated with ellipsoidal or spherical shapes with a lamellar internal arrangement of pDNA chains and CD bilayers. Computational studies support that the stability of such supramolecular edifices is directly related to the tendency of the molecular vector to form noncovalent dimers upon DNA templating. Because the stability of the dimers depends on the protonation state of the polycationic clusters, the coaggregates display pH responsiveness, which facilitates endosomal escape and timely DNA release, a key step in successful transfection. The results provide a versatile strategy for the construction of fully synthetic and perfectly monodisperse nonviral gene delivery systems uniquely suited for optimization schemes.","Neva, Tania; Carbajo-Gordillo, Ana I; Benito, Juan M; Lana, Hugo; Marcelo, Gema; Ortiz Mellet, Carmen; Tros de Ilarduya, Conchita; Mendicuti, Francisco; García Fernández, José M",Chemistry,,438

We found four independently evolved radiations in the evolutionary hexaploid (2n = 150) Labeobarbus lineage based on matrilineal relationships of >800 individuals. Each radiation displayed similar patterns of mouth phenotype diversification, and included ecomorphs/species of the generalized, lipped, scraping (one or two), and large-mouthed (one to three) types. All radiations were detected in geographically isolated rivers, and originated from different ancestral populations. This is the first documented case in which numerous parallel radiations of fishes occurred-via different ways-in a riverine environment. Some radiations are very recent and monophyletic, while others are older and include ecomorphs that originated in separate mini flocks and later combined into one. The diversification bursts among Ethiopian Labeobarbus were detected in the mid-upper reaches of rivers (1050-1550 m above sea level), which likely offer ecological opportunities that include diverse habitats yet poor fauna (i.e. lower competition and relaxed selection). This promising example of parallel evolution of adaptive radiation warrants further investigation.","Levin, Boris A; Simonov, Evgeniy; Dgebuadze, Yury Y; Levina, Marina; Golubtsov, Alexander S",Sci Rep,,438

There is a striking similarity between these hyper-inflammatory states and Kawasaki disease (KD). We present an interesting case of KD recurrence in a 10-year-old child, who had previously developed KD at 4 years of age. His symptoms included fever, maculopapular rash and altered sensorium. Investigations showed noticeably elevated inflammatory markers, and an echocardiography revealed dilated coronary arteries. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were positive. The child responded dramatically to intravenous immunoglobulin and intravenous methylprednisolone. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered the recurrence of KD in this child who might have been genetically predisposed to KD.","Renganathan, Ashok; Garg, Ankit; Chowdhary, Sona; Raj, Dinesh",BMJ case reports,,438

505621,Temporal Positive-unlabeled Learning for Biomedical Hypothesis Generation via Risk Estimation,2020-10-05,"BACKGROUND: A cluster of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia were discharged from hospitals in Wuhan, China. We aimed to determine the cumulative percentage of complete radiological resolution at each time point, to explore the relevant affecting factors, and to describe the chest CT findings at different time points after hospital discharge. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by RT-PCR who were discharged consecutively from the hospital between 5 February 2020 and 10 March 2020 and who underwent serial chest CT scans on schedule were enrolled. The radiological characteristics of all patients were collected and analysed. The total CT score was the sum of non-GGO involvement determined at discharge. Afterwards, all patients underwent chest CT scans during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd weeks after discharge. Imaging features and distributions were analysed across different time points. RESULTS: A total of 149 patients who completed all CT scans were evaluated; there were 67 (45.0%) men and 82 (55.0%) women, with a median age of 43 years old (IQR 36-56). The cumulative percentage of complete radiological resolution was 8.1% (12 patients), 41.6% (62), 50.3% (75), and 53.0% (79) at discharge and during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd weeks after discharge, respectively. Patients &#8804;44 years old showed a significantly higher cumulative percentage of complete radiological resolution than patients > 44 years old at the 3-week follow-up. The predominant patterns of abnormalities observed at discharge were ground-glass opacity (GGO) (125 [83.9%]), fibrous stripe (81 [54.4%]), and thickening of the adjacent pleura (33 [22.1%]). The positive count of GGO, fibrous stripe and thickening of the adjacent pleura gradually decreased, while GGO and fibrous stripe showed obvious resolution during the first week and the third week after discharge, respectively. ""Tinted"" sign and bronchovascular bundle distortion as two special features were discovered during the evolution. CONCLUSION: Lung lesions in COVID-19 pneumonia patients can be absorbed completely during short-term follow-up with no sequelae. Two weeks after discharge might be the optimal time point for early radiological estimation.","Liu, Dehan; Zhang, Wanshu; Pan, Feng; Li, Lin; Yang, Lian; Zheng, Dandan; Wang, Jiazheng; Liang, Bo",Respir Res,,438
505961,Monitoring Large Crowds With WiFi: A Privacy-Preserving Approach,2020-10-20,"AIM: To identify strategies that increase hospital bed capacity, material resources, and available nurse staffing during a national pandemic. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak resulted in an influx of acutely ill patients requiring critical care. The volume and acuity of this patient population increased the demand for care and stretched hospitals beyond their capacity. While increasing hospital bed capacity and material resources are crucial, healthcare systems have noted one of the greatest limitations to rapid expansion has been the number of available medical personnel, particularly those trained in emergency and critical care nursing. EVALUATION: Program evaluation occurred on a daily basis with hospital throughput, focusing on logistics including our ability to expand bed volume, resource utilization, and the ability to meet staffing needs. CONCLUSION: This article describes how a quaternary care hospital in New York City prepared for the COVID-19 surge in patients by maximizing and shifting nursing resources to its most impacted services, the emergency department (ED) and the intensive care units (ICUs). A tier-based staffing model and rapid training were operationalized to address nurse-staffing shortages in the ICU and ED, identifying key factors for swift deployment. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGERS: Frequent communication between staff and leaders improves teamwork and builds trust and buy-in during normal operations and particularly in times of crisis.","Wells, Celia M; Zhang, Ziya; Spano-Szekely, Lauraine; Siller, Jennifer; Brannon, Helen; Schulz, Kathleen; Scott, Christine; Dolphy, Melody; Hughes, Ellen; Kohli-Seth, Roopa",J Nurs Adm,,438
507447,Guest Editorial,2020,"The edible cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis and its chief biliprotein C-Phycocyanin have shown protective activity in animal models of diverse human health diseases, often reflecting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. The beneficial effects of C-Phycocyanin seem likely to be primarily attributable to its covalently attached chromophore Phycocyanobilin (PCB). Within cells, biliverdin is generated from free heme and it is subsequently reduced to bilirubin. Although bilirubin can function as an oxidant scavenger, its potent antioxidant activity reflects its ability to inactivate some isoforms of NADPH oxidase. Free bilirubin can also function as an agonist for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR); this may explain its ability to promote protective Treg activity in cellular and rodent models of inflammatory disease. AhR agonists also promote transcription of the gene coding for Nrf-2, and hence can up-regulate phase 2 induction of antioxidant enzymes such as HO-1. Hence, it is proposed that C-Phycocyanin/PCB chiefly exert their protective effects via inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity, as well as by AhR agonism that both induces Treg activity and up-regulates phase 2 induction. This simple model may explain their potent antioxidant/anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally, PCB might mimic biliverdin in activating anti-inflammatory signaling mediated by biliverdin reductase. This essay reviews recent research in which C-Phycocyanin and/or PCB, administered orally, parenterally, or intranasally, have achieved marked protective effects in rodent and cell culture models of Ischemic Stroke and Multiple Sclerosis, and suggests that these agents may likewise be protective for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and in COVID-19 and its neurological complications.","Pentón-Rol, Giselle; Marín-Prida, Javier; McCarty, Mark F",Curr. neuropharmacol,,438

508752,Online student authentication and proctoring system based on multimodal biometrics technology,2021,"The health system's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has involved research into diagnoses and vaccines, but primarily it has required specific treatments, facilities and equipment, together with the control of individual behaviour and a period of collective confinement. The aim of this particular research, therefore, is to discover whether COVID-19 is capable of changing the built environment (BE) and leveraging specific solutions for sustainable buildings or urban areas. Some historical reviews of infectious pandemics have highlighted the development of new solutions in the BE as an additional contribution towards preventing the spread of infection. The BE has an important role to play in supporting public health measures and reducing the risk of infections. The review of potential COVID-19 measures shows the existence of well-referenced solutions, ranging from incremental alterations (organisation of spaces, erection of physical barriers) to structural alterations (windows, balconies) with different timeframes and scales (ranging from changes in building materials to the design of urban areas). A critical exploratory assessment makes it possible to identify measures that may help not only to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission (or even prevent it), but also to increase resilience, improve air quality and lower energy requirements or the use of materials, and thus potentially increase the sustainability of the BE. COVID-19 measures challenge us to rethink buildings and urban areas and potentially leverage sustainable BE solutions with win-win outcomes (minimalist design and other solutions). The specific composition of this set of measures must, however, be further researched.","Pinheiro, Manuel Duarte; Luís, Nuno Cardoso",Sustainability,,438
510769,CovFrameNet: An enhanced deep learning framework for COVID-19 detection,2021,"Importance/Background: With a scarcity of high-grade evidence for COVID-19 treatment, researchers and health care providers across the world have resorted to classical and historical interventions. Immunotherapy with convalescent plasma (CPT) is one such therapeutic option. Methods: A systematized search was conducted for articles published between December 2019 and 18th January 2021 focusing on convalescent plasma efficacy and safety in COVID-19. The primary outcomes were defined as mortality benefit in patients treated with convalescent plasma compared to standard therapy/placebo. The secondary outcome was pooled mortality rate and the adverse event rate in convalescent plasma-treated patients. Results: A total of 27,706 patients were included in the qualitative analysis, and a total of 3,262 (2,127 in convalescent plasma-treated patients and 1,135 in the non-convalescent plasma/control group) patients died. The quantitative synthesis in 23 studies showed that the odds of mortality in patients who received plasma therapy were significantly lower than those in patients who did not receive plasma therapy [odds ratio (OR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-0.80, p &lt; 0.0001, I (2) = 15%). The mortality benefit remains the same even for 14 trials/prospective studies (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43-0.81, p = 0.001, I (2) = 22%) as well as for nine case series/retrospective observational studies (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65-0.94, p = 0.01, I (2) = 0%). However, in a subgroup analysis for 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), there was no statistically significant reduction in mortality between the CPT group compared to the non-CPT group (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.53-1.08, p = 0.13, I (2) = 7%). Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis of 10 RCTs, excluding the study with the highest statistical weight, displayed a lower mortality rate compared to that of non-CPT COVID-19 patients (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42-0.97, p = 0.04, I (2) = 0%). The observed pooled mortality rate was 12.9% (95% CI 9.7-16.9%), and the pooled adverse event rate was 6.1% (95% CI 3.2-11.6), with significant heterogeneity. Conclusions and Relevance: Our systemic review and meta-analysis suggests that CPT could be an effective therapeutic option with promising evidence on the safety and reduced mortality in concomitant treatment for COVID-19 along with antiviral/antimicrobial drugs, steroids, and other supportive care. Future exploratory studies could benefit from more standardized reporting, especially in terms of the timing of interventions and clinically relevant outcomes, like days until discharge from the hospital and improvement of clinical symptoms.","Bansal, V.; Mahapure, K.

Pooling the clinical samples before testing can be a good cost-saving and rapid alternative for screening large populations. The aim of this study was to compare the performance characteristics, feasibility and effectiveness of pooling nasal swab and throat swab samples for screening and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: The pool testing was applied on a set of samples coming from low COVID-19 positivity areas. A total of 2410 samples were tested in pools of five samples each. A total of five pools of five samples each were generated and tested for E gene. Results: Of the total of 482 pools (2410 samples) 24 pools flagged positive. Later on pool de-convolution, a total of 26 samples were detected as positive for COVID-19, leading to positivity of about one per cent in the test population. For the diagnosis of individual samples, the pooling strategies resulted in cost savings of 75 per cent (5 samples per pool). Interpretation & conclusions: It was observed that testing samples for COVID-19 by reverse transcription (RT)- PCR after pooling could be a cost-effective method which would save both in manpower and cost especially for resource-poor countries and at a time when test kits were short in supply.","Prakash, Shantanu; Prakash, Om; Mishra, Hricha; Khan, Danish N; Shukla, Suruchi; Pandey, Ajay; Rade, Kiran; Gupta, Nivedita; Bhatt, M L B; Jain, Amita",Indian J Med Res,,438

A handful pieces of literature have summarized its clinical and radiologic features, whereas therapies for COVID-19 are rather limited. To evaluate the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in COVID-19 patients, we did this timely descriptive study. Six laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled and received the transfusion of ABO-compatible convalescent plasma. The efficacy of this intervention was determined by the alleviation of symptoms, changes in radiologic abnormalities and laboratory tests. No obvious adverse effect observed during the treatment. Transfusion of convalescent plasma led to a resolution of ground-glass opacities and consolidation in patients #1, #2, #3, #4, and #6. In patients #1 and #5 who presented with SARS-CoV-2 in throat swab, convalescent plasma therapy elicited an elimination of the virus. Serologic analysis indicated an immediate increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers in patients #2 and #3, but not in patient #1. This study indicates that convalescent plasma therapy is effective and specific for COVID-19. This intervention has a special significance for eliminating SARS-CoV-2 and is believed to be a promising state-of-the-art therapy during COVID-19 pandemic crisis.","Ye, Mingxiang; Fu, Dian; Ren, Yi; Wang, Faxiang; Wang, Dong; Zhang, Fang; Xia, Xinyi; Lv, Tangfeng",J. med. virol,,438

While previous work explored the potential of automatically monitoring exercises for AI and robotic coaches, the deployment of these systems remains a challenge. Previous work described the lack of involving stakeholders to design such functionalities as one of the major causes. In this paper, we present our efforts on eliciting the detailed design specifications on how AI and robotic coaches could interact with and guide patient's exercises in an effective and acceptable way with four therapists and five post-stroke survivors. Through iterative questionnaires and interviews, we found that both post-stroke survivors and therapists appreciated the potential benefits of AI and robotic coaches to achieve more systematic management and improve their self-efficacy and motivation on rehabilitation therapy. In addition, our evaluation sheds light on several practical concerns (e.g. a possible difficulty with the interaction for people with cognitive impairment, system failures, etc.). We discuss the value of early involvement of stakeholders and interactive techniques that complement system failures, but also support a personalized therapy session for the better deployment of AI and robotic exercise coaches.","Lee, Min Hun; Siewiorek, Daniel P.; Smailagic, Asim; Bernardino, Alexandre; Badia, Sergi Berm'udez i",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.08458v1.pdf,438
514474,User Attention and Behaviour in Virtual Reality Art Encounter,2020-05-20,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of an ongoing pandemic. The highest mortality rate is observed among the older adult population. During the first wave of the pandemic (March-June 2020), following a national health decree demanding that no visitors or family members be allowed in health institutions, our geriatric rehabilitation center closed gates to all visitors from the outside. We aimed to assess the rehabilitation outcomes of older patients with hip fractures in the first pandemic wave, who underwent rehabilitation under complete social isolation from primary care givers and family members. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. It took place at a university-affiliated, major postacute geriatric rehabilitation center. Rehabilitation outcomes measured were discharge functional independence measure (FIM) score and motor FIM score, FIM score change, motor FIM score change, favorable motor FIM effectiveness, length of stay, discharge destination, and home aid at discharge. RESULTS: The study group included 36 patients who were admitted during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1, 2020, to June 30, 2020). The control group comprises 106 individuals with hip fractures who were admitted in the respective time periods during the previous 2 years, that is, March 1, 2018, to June 30, 2018, and March 1, 2019, to June 30, 2019. The facility's occupancy rates were much lower during the first wave of the pandemic in comparison with previous years (78 and 99%, respectively). Patients showed similar demographics and comorbidities, but the social isolation group was more severely deconditioned upon admission. All rehabilitation outcomes were similar between groups. CONCLUSION: According to the findings of this retrospective study, social isolation from family and caregivers did not have a detrimental effect on the rehabilitation outcomes of these patients. More evidence must be gathered and presented on the matter.","Leibovici-Weissman, Yaara; Levy, Yochai; Michaelis, Michal; Hershkovitz, Avital",Gerontology,,438

515079,Different approaches to encode and model 3D information in a MIA-QSAR perspective,2021,"Background and Objectives: Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) guidelines are of great importance for all organizations, and governments and regulators are becoming more strict on HSE issue The onset and prevalence of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an example of a lack of attention to such standards and guidelines Adherence to such standards is much more important in all organizations, especially in health-oriented organizations such as hospitals, and they increases safety and improves the efficiency of hospitals and the community (environment) Because health and safety factors are closely related to ergonomic factors (E), attention to this factor has led to the evolution of HSE and the emergence of HSEE Much research has been done on HSE management, related evaluations, and other related issues However, due to the novelty of HSEE, such models have rarely been researched in HSEE In addition, in previous models, the weight of all factors was considered the same, and the evaluations were practically turned into checklists While in any organization or in any situation, the importance of observing some factors may be more or less than others, and at the same time the ergonomic factor should be considered in this model The purpose of this study is to provide a quantitative model for measuring the performance of organizational units based on the observance of the usual HSE criteria and consider the ergonomic factor (HSEE) Numerous studies have shown that ergonomics play a major role in increasing human performance in all areas Developing such a model can lead to more accurate information to managers and their better decision-making in order to reduce harm in the organization as well as organization environment It will also provide more accurate feedback to the organization's units for self-assessment and calculation of any points for them, and ultimately ranking the units Research Method: Since the result of this research is a model that can be used in practice by organizations (especially hospitals), this research is an applied research It is also a descriptive study because it explores the current situation and tries to describe and clarify it and present the result in the form of a quantitative model Finally, because the data in this study is collected through a questionnaire, it is a survey study In the first phase, studies related to the HSE and HSEE models were reviewed In each model, the main variables (health, safety, environment and ergonomics) were collected along with the following variables for each Then, by combining them into one large model, all variables entered the model and overlaps were eliminated Because this model is made for a hospital, the variables were redefined based on the characteristics of the hospital and the model was modified Finally, a model including the main variables of safety, health, environment and ergonomics and 12 sub-variables were designed and a research questionnaire was developed To calculate the reliability of this questionnaire, Cronbach's alpha method with 11 samples were used This sample was selected by emphasizing on people's familiarity with HSE and HSEE models The alpha value was calculated to be greater than 0 8 and the reliability of the questionnaire was confirmed In order to discover the relationship between the 4 main factors and 12 sub-factors, the DEMATEL method with 8 samples was used DEMATEL's method is a well-known method used to the models with independent variables Using the initial classification of factors as well as HSE(E), the decision tree was designed based on ANP method and also the weight of the indicators was obtained The ANP method is based on pairwise comparisons and a subset of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques used to discover the weight of criteria simultaneously with ranking alternatives Because each of the ANP and DEMATEL questionnaires requires a lot of patience and concentration, the YungLan method was used to combine DEMATEL and ANP In this method, the data collection is required only once by he questionnaire and this data is reused in both models At this stage, the weight of 12 factors was calculated and the research model was completely architectural The designed model was implemented in ArabNia Hospital in Qom The goal is to determine how well each of the eight units in the hospital complies with HSEE ArabNia Hospital is the first hospital in Iran, Qom, where patients with COVID-19 were quarantined in February 2020 Because there was no information on how well each of the HSEE components were observed in the hospital, a simple questionnaire using the Likert's spectrum was designed to collect this information This questionnaire was published in a total of 8 units and 11 questionnaires were completed This data was entered into the model as input, and after analysis, hospital units were ranked based on compliance with safety, health, environmental and ergonomic criteria Results: The most important achievement of this research is a quantitative model including 4 areas of safety, health, environment and ergonomics with 12 sub-variables The results showed a correlation between the main domains as well as the research variables Identifying these connections revealed that the decision hierarchy is network type and the model governing the problem is ANP type However, in some research the AHP model was used for this purpose The premise of this model is that the variables are sufficiently independent of each other, which was rejected in this study The results of using this model in the study area also showed that ergonomic factor has the greatest impact on other macro factors, and employee factor has the greatest impact on other 11 sub-variables of research This model was used to evaluate all 8 units of the hospital The goal is to determine how well each of these units complies with HSEE If there is data related to the observance of each sub-variable by each unit in the hospital documents, the relevant data can be entered into the model and after analysis, the amount of HSEE observance by each unit can be determined Because many cases are not recorded in organizations, access to the necessary data is not possible through the hospital's databases Since the organization's staff are the only ones who have a lot of data and metadata in their mental history (albeit to some extent, vague and erroneous), a questionnaire was used to solve this problem For ease of response, the Likert range was used in qualitative measurements This questionnaire was distributed in 8 units and 11 questionnaires were completed and received The required data were analyzed by the research model and 8 hospital units were ranked based on HSEE compliance The results showed that, firstly, the weight of each of the 12 factors of the HSEE model is not the same, and secondly, there is a relationship between them, and finally, the ranking of the units is not the same Conclusion: The results proved the power of model differentiation Using the results obtained in this study, the extent to each components of the HSEE model is affected and differ from each other The use of the model in ArabNia Hospital in Qom showed that the medical, financial and administrative equipment units are ranked first to third in the field of HSEE, respectively With the development of the HSEE measurement model, including the determination of indicators, sub-indicators, their relationship and the weight of each of them, it was found that the weight of the employee invoice is higher than other sub-factors This study provides a framework for measuring hospital performance in terms of HSEE compliance This model can be used in other hospitals as well The point to keep in mind is that it is necessary to recalculate the weight of the variables and

It should be noted that the main foundation and architecture of the model is fixed, but due to the difference in th nature of organizations, such a change in the details of the model is necessary In addition, the relationship between the factors and their weight must be recalculated The results of this study are consistent with many studies conducted in the field of HSE, Including the fact that the human factor is very important in establishing HSE in organizations and complying with the relevant rules and regulations The difference between the model presented in this study and other research is that the relationship between the factors in this model is considered Although this is not explicitly stated, the use of AHP in some studies is due to the fact that independent HSE variables have been considered and the relationship between them have not been considered Some recent research has shown that the combination of DEMATEL and ANP has been used in the HSE model, which indicates an increase in accuracy in such research However, ergonomic factors are absent in these studies In the present study, an attempt has been made to pay attention to all these aspects © 2020

515552,A Security Management Framework for Big Data in Smart Healthcare,2021,"The treatment of COVID-19 has been a source of intense controversy in the past. A variety of clinical trials and retrospective studies have shown mixed findings about the effectiveness of certain repurposed medications proposed to treat COVID-19, highlighting the need for further testing.The aim of this research was to add to the current literature some data on the effectiveness and protection of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZ) as COVID-19 treatment drugs.The results of a traditional therapy (CT) incorporating HCQ and AZ used in the Democratic Republic of India are recorded in this empirical analysis. We contrasted epidemiological and clinical evidence from 1100 (89%) respondents who received the CT and 135 (11%) who did not obtain the TC. At the start of therapy, survival analyses such as Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression were used to assess health success at day 10 and the probability of survival at day 15.On D10, the clinical result in the TC population is significantly higher than in the reference group (p-0.001). The observed side effects are mild and similar in both categories (3 percent vs. 3 percent). Conclusion: This tentative retrospective analysis shows that traditional medicine has a positive and healthy impact in our region, justifying the protocol's continuity at this period. To improve the power of measurements, broader empirical studies with more rigorous assessment parameters are needed.","Agarwal, S. K.; Salis, V. E.; Bommanna Raja, K.; Karthikeyini, C.; Gupta, P.

515800,Interview With Prince Afriyie: From Ghana to America,2020,"Background: New commercially available point-of-care (POC) immunodiagnostic tests are appearing, which may yield rapid results for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of rapid antibody detection tests compared to a validated laboratory-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and to investigate infections amongst healthcare workers (HCWs) after unprotected close contact to COVID-19 patients. Methods: Blood serum and whole blood of 130 participants were tested with NADAL® COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test and mö-screen 2019-NCOV coronavirus test against a validated ELISA test. Infection status was evaluated using real-time polymerase-chain-reaction. Results: Acute COVID-19 infection was detected in 2.4% of exposed HCWs. Antibody tests showed an overall frequency of IgG and IgM in 5.3%, with 1.6% asymptomatic infections. The NADAL® test showed a sensitivity (IgM/IgG) of 100% (100%/100%), a specificity (IgM/IgG) of 98.8% (97.6%/100 %), a PPV of 76.9% (57.1%/100%), an NPV of 100% (100%/100%), and a diagnostic accuracy of 98.8% (97.7%/100%). The mö-screen test had a sensitivity (IgM/IgG) of 90.9% (80%/100%), a specificity (IgM/IgG) of 98.8% (97.6%/100%), a PPV of 76.9% (57.1%/100%), an NPV of 99.6% (99.2%/100%), and a diagnostic accuracy of 98.5% (96.9%/100%). Conclusions: The frequency of COVID-19 infections in HCWs after unprotected close contact is higher than in the general population of a low-prevalence country. Both POC tests were useful for detecting IgG, but did not perform well for IgM, mainly due to false positive results.","Hackner, Klaus; Errhalt, Peter; Willheim, Martin; Schragel, Felix; Grasl, Maria-Anna; Lagumdzija, Jasmina; Riegler, Waltraud; Ecker, Michael; Wechdorn, Matthias; Thalhammer, Florian; Assadian, Ojan",GMS Hyg Infect Control,,438

At that time, the conventional medical system was grappling to cope with the rapidly spreading pandemic. The potential of Ayurveda, one of the branches of traditional Indian medicine (TIM), with a 5000 year old history, employing medicines derived from plants and other natural sources, against COVID-19 has been explored through a comparative retrospective open-label study. Methods: Reported here are the remedial effects of Ayurvedic medicines alone or in combination with Allopathic treatment on 59 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients, across multiple COVID-19 care centers in Ahmedabad, India. The patients were confirmed for COVID-19 infection through RT-qPCR of nasopharyngeal swabs. With informed consents from the patients, the sourced data was divided into 'Allopathic and Ayurvedic' [AlloAyur] (n = 41) and 'Ayurvedic only'[Ayur] (n = 18) groups, based on the type of treatment the patients decided to receive, that is Ayurvedic medicines with Allopathic treatment or Ayurvedic medicines alone, respectively. Ayurvedic medicines included oral doses and nasal drops; the dosage and regime were decided based on the recommendations from Ayurvedic texts. The Allopathic medicines included Azithromycin, Vitamin-C and anti-histamines. Acetaminophen was also administered when necessary, by the attending physician. The patients were observed for symptomatic improvement. Results: Primary outcome of this study was the symptomatic relief from COVID-19. Data collected over a period of two months, showed that more patients exhibited symptomatic relief in Ayur goup (83.33%) than in the AlloAyur group (48.78%) within the first 13 days of treatment. No visible adverse effects were observed. This indicated faster and safe symptomatic resolution among those treated with Ayurvedic medicines alone. Conclusion: Patients receiving only Ayurvedic medicines on average were symptomatically relieved faster than those receiving Allopathic and Ayurvedic medicines together.","Balkrishna, Acharya; Bhatt, Aarti Ben; Singh, Pratima; Haldar, Swati; Varshney, Anurag",J Herb Med,,438

To solve this multi-dimensional tradeoff of exploitation and exploration, we formulate this technical challenge as a contextual combinatorial bandit problem that jointly optimizes a multi-criteria reward function. Given the historical daily cases in a region and the past intervention plans in place, the agent should generate useful intervention plans that policy makers can implement in real time to minimizing both the number of daily COVID-19 cases and the stringency of the recommended interventions.

523511,SceneAR: Scene-based Micro Narratives for Sharing and Remixing in Augmented Reality,2021-08-28,"BackgroundIn March 2020, the government of Scotland identified people deemed clinically extremely vulnerable to COVID due to their pre-existing health conditions. These people were advised to strictly self-isolate (shield) at the start of the pandemic, except for necessary healthcare. We examined who was identified as clinically extremely vulnerable, how their healthcare changed during isolation, and whether this process exacerbated healthcare inequalities. MethodsWe linked those on the shielding register in NHS Grampian, a health authority in Scotland, to healthcare records from 2015-2020. We described the source of identification, demographics, and clinical history of the cohort. We measured changes in out-patient, in-patient, and emergency healthcare during isolation in the shielding population and compared to the general non-shielding population. ResultsThe register included 16,092 people (3% of the population), clinically vulnerable primarily due to a respiratory disease, immunosuppression, or cancer. Among them, 42% were not identified by national healthcare record screening but added ad hoc, with these additions including more children and fewer economically-deprived. During isolation, all forms of healthcare use decreased (25%-46%), with larger decreases in scheduled care than in emergency care. However, people shielding had better maintained scheduled care compared to the non-shielding general population: out-patient visits decreased 35% vs 49%; in-patient visits decreased 46% vs 81%. Notably, there was substantial variation in whose scheduled care was maintained during isolation: younger people and those with cancer had significantly higher visit rates, but there was no difference between sexes or socioeconomic levels. ConclusionsHealthcare changed dramatically for the clinically extremely vulnerable population during the pandemic. The increased reliance on emergency care while isolating indicates that continuity of care for existing conditions was not optimal. However, compared to the general population, there was success in maintaining scheduled care, particularly in young people and those with cancer. We suggest that integrating demographic and primary care data would improve identification of the clinically vulnerable and could aid prioritising their care.","Butler, Jessica Erin; Nath, Mintu; Blana, Dimitra; Ball, William P; Beech, Nicola; Black, Corri; Osler, Graham; Peytrignet, Sebastien; Wilde, Katie; Wozniak, Artur; Sawhney, Simon",,,438

We adopted early CPAP and self-proning, and evaluated the safety and efficacy of this approach.MethodsThis retrospective observational study included all patients with a positive COVID-19 PCR, and others with high clinical suspicion. Our protocol advised early CPAP and self-proning for severe cases, aiming to prevent rather than respond to deterioration. CPAP was provided outside critical care by ward staff supported by physiotherapists and an intensive critical care outreach program. Data were analysed descriptively and compared against a large UK cohort (ISARIC).Results559 patients admitted before 1 May 2020 were included. 376 were discharged alive, and 183 died. 165 patients (29.5%) received CPAP, 40 (7.2%) were admitted to critical care and 28 (5.0%) were ventilated. Hospital mortality was 32.7%, and 50% for critical care. Following CPAP, 62% of patients with S:F or P:F ratios indicating moderate or severe ARDS, who were candidates for escalation, avoided intubation. Figures for critical care admission, intubation and hospital mortality are lower than ISARIC, whilst critical care mortality is similar. Following ISARIC proportions we would have admitted 92 patients to critical care and intubated 55. Using the described protocol, we intubated 28 patients from 40 admissions, and remained within our expanded critical care capacity.ConclusionBradford?s protocol produced good results despite our population having high levels of co-morbidity and ethnicities associated with poor outcomes. In particular we avoided overloading critical care capacity. We advocate this approach as both effective and safe.","Lawton, Tom Wilkinson Kate Corp Aaron Javid Rabeia MacNally Laura McCooe Michael Newton Elizabeth",Journal of the Intensive Care Society,,438

Methods: We searched the Medline, as well as BioRxiv and MedRxiv preprint servers for original research published in English from January 1, to May 20, 2020. We used the search terms COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 AND, animal models, hamsters, nonhuman primates, macaques, rodent, mice, rats, ferrets, rabbits, cats, and dogs. Inclusion criteria were the establishment of animal models of COVID-19 as an endpoint. Other inclusion criteria were assessment of prophylaxis, therapies, or vaccines, using animal models of COVID-19. Findings: 13 peer-reviewed studies and 14 preprints met inclusion criteria. The animals used were nonhuman primates (n=13), mice (n=7), ferrets (n =4), hamsters (n= 4), and cats (n =1). All animals supported high viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract associated with mild clinical manifestations, lung pathology and full recovery. Older animals displayed relatively more severe illness than the younger ones. No animal models developed hypoxemic respiratory failure, multiple organ dysfunction, culminating in death. All species elicited a specific IgG antibodies response to the spike proteins, which were protective against a second exposure. Transient systemic inflammation was observed occasionally in Rhesus macaques, hamsters, and mice. Notably, none of the animals unveiled cytokine storm or coagulopathy. Conclusions: Most of the animal models of COVID-19 recapitulated mild pattern of human COVID-19 with full recovery phenotype. No severe illness associated with mortality was observed, suggesting a wide gap between COVID-19 in humans and animal models.","Ehaideb, S. N.; Abdullah, M.

First, docking studies of three known electrophilic compounds led to results consistent with co-crystallized data validating the method for SARS-CoV-2 M(Pro) covalent inhibition. Then, libraries of soft electrophiles (overall 41 757 compounds) were submitted to docking-based virtual screening resulting in the identification of 17 molecules having their electrophilic group close to the Cys145 residue. We also investigated flexible docking studies of a focused approved covalent drugs library including 32 compounds with various electrophilic functional groups.

591082,Internet of vehicles and autonomous systems with AI for medical things,2021-07-22,"The Michael addition reaction is a spontaneous and quick chemical reaction that is widely applied in various fields. This reaction is performed by conjugating an addition of nucleophiles with α, β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, resulting in the bond formation of C-N, C-S, C-O, and so on. In the development of molecular materials, the Michael addition is not only used to synthesize chemical compounds but is also involved in the mechanism of drug action. Several covalent drugs that bond via Michael addition are regarded as anticarcinogens and anti-inflammatory drugs. Although drug development is mainly focused on pharmaceutical drug discovery, target-based discovery can provide a different perspective for drug usage. However, considerable time and labor are required to define a molecular target through molecular biological experiments. In this review, we systematically examine the chemical structures of current FDA-approved antiviral drugs for potential Michael addition moieties with α, β-unsaturated carbonyl groups, which may exert an unidentified broad-spectrum inhibitory mechanism to target viral or host factors. We thus propose that profiling the targets of antiviral agents, such as Michael addition products, can be achieved by employing a high-throughput LC-MS approach to comprehensively analyze the interaction between drugs and targets, and the subsequent drug responses in the cellular environment to facilitate drug repurposing and/or identify potential adverse effects, with a particular emphasis on the pros and cons of this shotgun proteomic approach.","Chu, Hao-Wei; Sethy, Bidyadhar; Hsieh, Pei-Wen; Horng, Jim-Tong",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13091756; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34578337/,438

The SCOPE COVID-19 survey aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on third-line treatment goals in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and compare it with daily practice patterns from the pre–COVID-19 era. Methods: An expert panel of gastrointestinal oncologists developed the survey, which was undertaken between October 2020–January 2021. Questions were designed to evaluate the practice patterns during this time and assess the future impact of COVID-19 on treatment decisions. The survey was conducted online using FocusVision Decipher. Oncologists from 14 countries, the majority of which were in Europe, participated. Results: As of 31 January 2021, there were 228 respondents. The majority were medical oncologists (89%), aged between 35–55 years (62%), practiced in a university hospital (49%), and saw between 10–29 patients with mCRC/month (53%). Overall, few restrictions affecting cancer patient management, such as staff being redeployed, were reported by the majority of oncologists (84%). That said, there were a number of changes to practice patterns: the most frequent were a reduction in the number of hospital visits (83%), increased use of virtual consultations/telemedicine (82%), increased frequency of prescribing oral versus intravenous (IV) treatments (73%), and an increase in follow-up/monitoring procedures done closer to home (73%). The third-line treatment goals remained similar to the pre-COVID era;preserving quality of life remained the singular most common primary goal (36%), while 42% of respondents cited efficacy-focused goals, such as prolonging overall survival and improving progression-free survival as their main aim. Overall, 93% of oncologists opined that treatment decisions over the next 12 months will be influenced by the pandemic. While 86% predicted a return to normal for the initial visits for new patients, thereafter and for ongoing patients, 83% foresee that there will be a continued increase in the use of virtual consultations/telemedicine, 80% envision reduced frequency of hospital visits, and 74% foresee the increased frequency of prescribing oral versus IV treatments to be maintained, as well as follow-up being undertaken closer to home. In total, 40% of oncologists believe that the changes to existing protocols, incurred as a result of the pandemic, will be in effect for at least a year. Conclusions: The main third-line treatment goals for patients with mCRC remained the same during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there were changes to the daily practice patterns. There was an increased use of oral versus IV therapies, and more follow-up and monitoring procedures were undertaken closer to home. Patients visited hospitals less frequently, with a shift toward virtual consultations/telemedicine, practices that are thought to continue for the foreseeable future. The latter observation suggests there is a need to further develop and invest in all aspects of digital health.

However, it is less clear whether and how BST2 inhibits the release of enveloped viruses which bud via the secretory pathway. Here, we demonstrated that BST2 restricts the release of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) whose budding occurs at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, and in turn, JEV infection downregulates BST2 expression. We further found that the JEV envelope protein E, but not other viral components, significantly downregulates BST2 with the viral protein M playing an auxiliary role in the process. Envelope protein E-mediated BST2 downregulation appears to undergo lysosomal degradation pathway. Additional study revealed that the transmembrane domain and the coiled-coil domain (CC) of BST2 are the target domains of viral protein E and that the N- and C-terminal membrane anchors and the CC domain of BST2 are essential for blocking JEV release. Our results together indicate that the release of enveloped viruses whose budding take place in an intracellular compartment can be restricted by BST2.","Li, Mei; Wang, Ping; Zheng, Zifeng; Hu, Kai; Zhang, Mudan; Guan, Xinmeng; Fu, Ming; Zhang, Di; Wang, Wei; Xiao, Gengfu; Hu, Qinxue; Liu, Yalan",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682217302209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28710958/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.07.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682217302209,438

METHODS: A computer screening program electronically searches primary care records in routine clinical practice to identify patients with advanced illness who are not already on a PCR. Five GPs were asked to “think aloud” about adding patients identified by computer screening to the PCR. Key informant interviews with 6 patients on the PCR and 4 carers about their experiences of palliative care while on the PCR and their views of this technology. Data were analyzed thematically. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Using computer screening, 29% additional patients were added by GPs to the PCR. GP decision-making for the PCR was informed by clinical factors such as: if being treated with curative intent; having stable or unstable disease; end-stage disease, frailty; the likelihood of dying within the next 12 months; and psychosocial factors such as, age, personality, patient preference and social support. Six (60%) patients/carers did not know that they/their relative was on the PCR. From a patient/carer perspective, having a non-curative illness was not in and of itself sufficient reason for being on the PCR; other factors such as, unstable disease and avoiding pain and suffering were equally if not more, important. Patients and carers considered that computer screening should support but not replace, GP decision-making about the PCR. Computer screening merits ongoing development as a tool to aid clinical decision-making around entry to a PCR, but should not be used as a sole criterion. Care need, irrespective of diagnosis, disease trajectory or prognosis, should determine care.","Hubbard, Gill; Broadfoot, Kirsten; Carolan, Clare; van Woerden, Hugo C.",J Prim Care Community Health,https://doi.org/10.1177/21501327211024402; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34120501/,438

Because COVID-19 patients with acute cardiac injury have higher mortality compared to those without, we assumed that this risk score may also predict acute cardiac injury in these patients. METHODS: In this retrospective, single centre cohort study, we included 352 hospitalised patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and divided into three groups according to M-CHA2DS2VASc risk score which was created by changing gender criteria of the CHA2DS2VASc from female to male (Group 1, score 0-1 (n = 142); group 2, score 2-3 (n = 138) and group 3, score &#8805;4 (n = 72)). RESULTS: As the M-CHA2DS2VASc risk score increased, acute cardiac injury was also significantly increased (Group 1, 11.3%; group 2, 48.6%; group 3, 76%; p < 0.001). The higher M-CHA2DS2VASc tertile had higher prevalence of arrhythmias compared to lower tertile. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that M-CHA2DS2VASc risk score, admission to intensive care unit and invasive mechanical ventilation were independent predictors of acute cardiac injury (p = 0.001, odds ratio 1.675 per scale for M-CHA2DS2VASc). In receiver operating characteristic analysis, M-CHA2DS2VASc risk score was able to predict acute cardiac injury (Area under the curve value for acute cardiac injury was 0.80; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Admission M-CHA2DS2VASc risk score was associated with acute cardiac injury in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.","Sonsoz, Mehmet Rasih; Alp, Murat Erdem; Guven, Gulden; Guler, Ahmet; Unsel, Murat; Altuntas Aydin, Ozlem",Acta Cardiol,https://doi.org/10.1080/00015385.2021.1952000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34275416/,438

However, less is known about transmission in schools for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), who are often unable to mask or maintain social distancing. The objectives of this study were to determine SARS-CoV-2 positivity and in-school transmission rates using weekly screening tests for school staff and students and describe the concurrent deployment of mitigation strategies in six schools for children with IDD. METHODS: From November 23, 2020, to May, 28, 2021, weekly voluntary screening for SARS-CoV-2 with a high sensitivity molecular-based saliva test was offered to school staff and students. Weekly positivity rates were determined and compared to local healthcare system and undergraduate student screening data. School-based transmission was assessed among participants quarantined for in-school exposure. School administrators completed a standardized survey to assess school mitigation strategies. RESULTS: A total of 59 students and 416 staff participated. An average of 304 school staff and students were tested per week. Of 7289 tests performed, 21 (0.29%) new SARS-CoV-2 positive cases were identified. The highest weekly positivity rate was 1.2% (n = 4) across all schools, which was less than community positivity rates. Two cases of in-school transmission were identified, each among staff, representing 2% (2/103) of participants quarantined for in-school exposure. Mitigation strategies included higher than expected student mask compliance, reduced room capacity, and phased reopening. CONCLUSIONS: During 24 weeks that included the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in winter 2020-21, we found lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 screening test positivity among staff and students of six schools for children with IDD compared to community rates. In-school transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was low among those quarantined for in-school exposure. However, the impact of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant on the effectiveness of these proven mitigation strategies remains unknown.

The study was conducted in a 184-bed geriatric department in a university hospital during 4 winter months. All consecutive elderly persons admitted with a lower respiratory tract infection were included in the study. Clinical and laboratory parameters, a nasopharyngeal swab, and serological results for respiratory viruses were obtained for all participants. Available blood and sputum cultures were analysed. A total of 165 elderly persons (mean age, 82±6.8 years) were hospitalised with a lower respiratory tract infection. Familial flu-like illness (OR, 4.25; 95%CI, 1.4–13), better functionality (OR, 4; 95%CI, 1.3–14.15), and leucocyte count <10(10)/l (OR, 3; 95%CI, 1.3–7.1) were predictive for viral lower respiratory tract infection. Sixty (36.5%) definite diagnoses (positive blood culture, viral culture, or serological test) and seven (4.2%) probable diagnoses (positive sputum culture) were obtained. An early diagnosis (within 72 h) was possible in 38 (23%) and a late diagnosis in 29 (17.6%) participants. A nasopharyngeal swab contributed in 60.5% of the cases to an early diagnosis. Viral culture identified half (22/43) of the lower respiratory tract infections caused by influenza but only one of six lower respiratory tract infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus. In conclusion, a history of flu-like illness in family members and a total leucocyte count within normal limits makes a viral cause more likely in elderly people hospitalised with a lower respiratory tract infection during winter.

607815,Biochemical Responses of Medicinal Plant Tussilago farfara L. to Elevated Heavy Metal Concentrations in Soils of Urban Areas,2021-07-17,"ABSTRACT: The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus continually led to infect a large population worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes its NSP6 and Orf9c proteins to interact with sigma receptors that are implicated in lipid remodeling and ER stress response, to infect cells. The drugs targeting the sigma receptors, sigma-1 and sigma-2, have emerged as effective candidates to reduce viral infectivity, and some of them are in clinical trials against COVID-19. The antipsychotic drug, haloperidol, exerts remarkable antiviral activity, but, at the same time, the sigma-1 benzomorphan agonist, dextromethorphan, showed pro-viral activity. To explore the potential mechanisms of biased binding and activity of the two drugs, haloperidol and dextromethorphan towards NSP6, we herein utilized molecular docking–based molecular dynamics simulation studies. Our extensive analysis of the protein-drug interactions, structural and conformational dynamics, residual frustrations, and molecular switches of NSP6-drug complexes indicates that dextromethorphan binding leads to structural destabilization and increase in conformational dynamics and energetic frustrations. On the other hand, the strong binding of haloperidol leads to minimal structural and dynamical perturbations to NSP6. Thus, the structural insights of stronger binding affinity and favorable molecular interactions of haloperidol towards viral NSP6 suggests that haloperidol can be potentially explored as a candidate drug against COVID-19. KEY MESSAGES: •Inhibitors of sigma receptors are considered as potent drugs against COVID-19. •Antipsychotic drug, haloperidol, binds strongly to NSP6 and induces the minimal changes in structure and dynamics of NSP6. •Dextromethorphan, agonist of sigma receptors, binding leads to overall destabilization of NSP6. •These two drugs bind with NSP6 differently and also induce differences in the structural and conformational changes that explain their different mechanisms of action. •Haloperidol can be explored as a candidate drug against COVID-19.

In this retrospective cohort study, we included all neonates born to pregnant women with COVID-19 admitted to Ayatollah Rohani Hospital, Babol, Iran, from February 10 to May 20, 2020. Clinical features, treatments, and neonatal outcomes were measured. Eight neonates were included in the current study. The mean gestational age and birth weight of newborns were 37 ± 3.19 weeks (30(₊6)-40) and 3077.50 ± 697.64 gr (1720-3900), respectively. Apgar score of the first and fifth minutes in all neonates was ≥8 and ≥9 out of 10, respectively. The most clinical presentations in symptomatic neonates were respiratory distress, tachypnea, vomiting, and feeding intolerance. This manifestation and high levels of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) in three infants are common in neonatal sepsis. The blood culture in all of them was negative. They have been successfully treated with our standard treatment. Our pregnant women showed a pattern of clinical characteristics and laboratory results similar to those described for nonpregnant COVID-19 infection. This study found no evidence of intrauterine or peripartum transmission of COVID-19 from mother to her child. Furthermore, the long-term outcomes of neonates need more study.","Akbarian-Rad, Zahra; Mojaveri, Mohsen Haghshenas; Bouzari, Zinatossadat; Sadeghi, Farzin; Yahyapour, Yousef; Rad, Mojgan Naeimi; Alizadeh, Somayeh; Ebrahimpour, Soheil; Sepidarkish, Mahdi; Javanian, Mostafa",Infect Dis Obstet Gynecol,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9952701; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34188437/,438
612034,"Machine Learning: Algorithms, Real-World Applications and Research Directions",2021-03-22,"Background. As the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, there is increasing global interest in the role of serological testing for population monitoring and to inform public policy. However, limitations in serological study designs and test standards raise concerns about the validity of seroprevalence estimates and their utility in decision-making. There is now a critical window of opportunity to learn from early SARS-CoV-2 serology studies. We aimed to synthesize the results of SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance projects from around the world and provide recommendations to improve the coordination, strategy, and methodology of future serosurveillance efforts. Methods. This was a rapid systematic review of cross-sectional and cohort studies reporting seroprevalence outcomes for SARS-CoV 2. We included completed, ongoing, and proposed serosurveys. The search included electronic databases (PubMed, MedRXIV, BioRXIV, and WHO ICTPR); five medical journals (NEJM, BMJ, JAMA, The Lancet, Annals of Internal Medicine); reports by governments, NGOs, and health systems; and media reports (Google News) from December 1, 2019 to May 1, 2020. We extracted data on study characteristics and critically appraised prevalence estimates using Joanna Briggs Institute criteria. Results. Seventy records met inclusion criteria, describing 73 studies. Of these, 23 reported prevalence estimates: eight preprints, 14 news articles, and one government report. These studies had a total sample size of 35,784 and reported 42 prevalence estimates. Seroprevalence estimates ranged from 0.4% to 59.3%. No estimates were found to have a low risk of bias (43% high risk, 21% moderate risk, 36% unclear). Fifty records reported characteristics of ongoing or proposed serosurveys. Overall, twenty countries have completed, ongoing, or proposed serosurveys. Discussion. Study design, quality, and prevalence estimates of early SARS-CoV2 serosurveys are heterogeneous, suggesting that the urgency to examine seroprevalence may have compromised methodological rigour. Based on the limitations of included studies, future serosurvey investigators and stakeholders should ensure that: i) serological tests used undergo high-quality independent evaluations that include cross-reactivity; ii) all reports of serosurvey results, including media, describe the test used, sample size, and sampling method; and iii) initiatives are coordinated to prevent test fatigue, minimize redundant efforts, and encourage better study methodology.

Methods: A systematic literature review was performed using search engines (PubMed, Google Scholar, Medrixv and BioRixv) with keywords SARS CoV 2, novel coronavirus, COVID 19, ocular manifestations, conjunctival congestion, Ocular detection, Polymerase chain reaction, and conjunctivitis. The measure of heterogeneity was evaluated with the I2 statistic. The pooled proportion of patients presenting with symptoms and ocular samples PCR positivity was estimated. Results: A total of 20 studies (14 studies and 6 case reports) were included in the systematic review and 14 studies were included in the metaanalysis. The pooled prevalence of conjunctivitis was 5.17% (95% CI: 2.90 to 8.04). Conjunctivitis was reported as an initial symptom of the disease in 0.858 % (95% CI: 0.31 to 1.67). Common associated features include itching, chemosis, epiphora. Seven patients (29 %) with conjunctivitis showed positive results in ocular samples, whereas 13 patients (54%) showed positive only in their nasopharyngeal samples (NPs) or sputum samples and 4 patients (16 %) were negative for both NPs and Sputum as well as ocular samples. The pooled prevalence of ocular PCR positivity was 2.90 % (95% CI: 1.77 to 4.46) vs. NPs 89.8% (95% CI: 78.80 to 79.0). Conclusion: The prevalence of conjunctivitis and ocular samples PCR positivity among COVID 19 patients was low indicating that the eye is a less affected organ. However, conjunctivitis may present as the first symptom of the disease making the patient seek medical care at the earliest.","Sadhu, Soumen; Dandapani, Sushmitha Arcot; Mazumdar, Deepmala; Srinivasan, Sangeetha; Biswas, Jyotirmay",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.29.20142414; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.29.20142414v1?rss=1,438

BACKGROUND: This review is the first qualitative systematic review of nurses’ experiences since the beginning of the COVID‐19 pandemic in 2020. Understanding nurses’ experiences with COVID‐19 is important because nurses are among the most vital of healthcare workers. METHODS: This study used a qualitative systematic review methodology with thematic synthesis to analyse the included studies. Five databases (CINAHL, PubMed, Ovid, Web of Science, and PsycINFO) were searched from January to mid‐August 2020, and 25 abstracts were screened. Based on inclusion criteria, this qualitative systematic review included nine studies. RESULTS: Five themes were identified as barriers to COVID‐19 care by 133 hospital‐based nurses: limited information about COVID‐19, unpredictable tasks and challenging practices, insufficient support, concerns about family, and emotional and psychological stress. CONCLUSIONS: The five barriers identified in this review should be overcome to improve nurses’ experiences and, in turn, the quality of care patients with COVID‐19 receive. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: The findings from this review can be used to reform current healthcare and hospital‐support systems for populations with COVID‐19. They can also be used to point towards areas of research interested in improving frontline nursing. Finally, nursing leaders, healthcare policymakers and governments should use these findings to better support the nursing workforce in the current or a future pandemic.","Joo, Jee Young; Liu, Megan F.",Int Nurs Rev,https://doi.org/10.1111/inr.12648; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33420749/,438

L’objectif de cette étude était d’évaluer l’impact de l’évaluation précoce de ces patients par des référents infectiologues sur la prescription d’antibiotiques. Matériels et méthodes Tous les patients adultes consécutifs hospitalisés en service de médecine pour une pneumopathie à SARS-CoV-2 du 22/11/2020 au 5/02/2021 ont été inclus. L’évaluation était réalisée dans les 72h suivant l’hospitalisation. Les données cliniques, microbiologiques et les prescriptions d’antibiotiques étaient recueillies. L’objectif principal était la proportion de modification de la prescription antibiotique, définie comme l’ajout, l’arrêt ou la modification de la durée ou du spectre d’une antibiothérapie. Résultats Ont été inclus 135 patients d’âge médian 74 ans [61–84], dont 87 de sexe masculin (64 %). Les principales comorbidités étaient : surpoids chez 70 (52 %), diabète chez 38 (28 %) et HTA chez 78 (58 %). La classification de gravité (OMS) était peu sévère, modérée et sévère chez respectivement 67 (50 %), 44 (33 %) et 24 (18 %). Soixante-quinze (56 %) présentaient une toux, productive dans 18 cas (24 %). L’intervention du référent infectiologue a eu lieu en médiane 1 jour [0–1] après l’admission, et 48 (36 %) patients recevaient des antibiotiques, de l’amoxicilline–clavulanate ou une C3G chez 41 (85 %). Suite à l’avis du référent, une modification de l’antibiothérapie était préconisée pour 46 patients (34 %), dont un ajout. Parmi les 48 patients sous antibiothérapie, 45 (94 %) prescriptions ont été modifiées, avec 53 modifications : 25 (47 %) arrêts de tous les traitements antibiotiques, 14 (26 %) raccourcissements de la durée et 14 (26 %) modifications du spectre (réduction dans 12 cas). Au total, 176 jours d’antibiothérapie ont été évités. Après l’intervention du référent, un diagnostic de possible co-infection bactérienne était retenu chez 18 patients (13 %), documentée dans deux cas. Au total, 48 (36 %) patients étaient sous antibiotiques avant l’intervention et 24 (18 %) après. Conclusion Les co-infections bactériennes à l’admission chez les patients hospitalisés pour des pneumopathies à SARS-CoV-2 sont peu fréquentes, mais l’exposition aux traitements antibiotiques reste élevée. L’intervention d’un référent infectiologue dans le cadre du bon usage des antibiotiques a permis une forte réduction de l’exposition des patients à des antibiothérapies non justifiées.

When considering the total annual health-related spending of $3.5 trillion, these pathologies alone occupy about 4.3%. The prevalence of these ailments is rooted, at least in part, in the lack of specific preventative therapies that can be administered to muscle while it remains in the denervated state. To address this, skeletal muscle-derived ECM (skECM) was injected directly in denervated muscle with postoperative analysis performed at 20 weeks, including gait analysis, force production, cytokine quantification, and histological analysis. skECM was shown to be superior against non-injected muscle controls showing no difference in contraction force to uninjured muscle at 20 weeks. Cytokines IL-1β, IL-18, and IFNγ appeared to mediate regeneration with statistical regression implicating these cytokines as strong predictors of muscle contraction, showing significant linear correlation.","Schilling, Benjamin K; Baker, Jocelyn S; Komatsu, Chiaki; Marra, Kacey G",J Tissue Eng,https://doi.org/10.1177/20417314211032491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34567507/,438

Methods On World Oral Health Day, 2021 dental examinations were conducted for patients while they drove through an existing COVID-19 screening clinic. The ICDAS-II index (International Caries Detection and Assessment System), score two to six, was used for caries assessment and management. Patients were categorised into three groups based on number of decayed teeth (less than three, three to six or more than six). The management criteria was based on the ICDAS score of teeth under each of the three categories.

To better understand and to document these impacts, we contacted anaesthesia trainees and trainers across six continents and collated their experiences during the pandemic. All aspects of training programmes have been affected. Trainees report that reduced case-load, sub-specialty experience and supervised procedures are impairing learning. Cancelled educational activities, postponed exams and altered rotations threaten progression through training. Job prospects and international opportunities are downgraded. Work related anxieties about provision of Personal Protective Equipment, and risks to self and to colleagues are superimposed on concerns for family and friends and domestic disruption. These seismic changes have had consequences for wellbeing and mental health. In response, anaesthetists have developed innovations in teaching and trainee support. New technologies support trainer-trainee interactions, with a focus on e-learning. National training bodies and medical regulators that specify training and oversee assessment of trainees and their progression have provided flexibility in their requirements.

A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs10774671, presumably responsible for alternate splicing of this gene, has frequently been associated with a variety of viral diseases, including emerging respiratory infections. We investigated the SNP-dependent expression of OAS1 variants in primary cultured human bronchial epithelial cells. Total RNA was subjected to real-time RT-PCR with specific primer sets designed to amplify each transcript variant. We found that the p46 transcript was mainly expressed in cells with the GG genotype, whereas the p42 transcript was highly expressed, and the p44a (alternate exon in intron 5), p48, and p52 transcripts were expressed to a lesser extent, in cells with the AA genotype. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the p46 isoform and a smaller amount of the p42 isoform were present in cells with the GG genotype, whereas only the p42 isoform was clearly observed in cells with the AA genotype. Cellular DNA fragmentation induced by neutrophil elastase was more preferentially found in cells with the AA genotype.

These include the European Commission’s European Green Deal, Coronavirus Recovery Plan and revamped Hydrogen Strategy; international calls for a green, sustainable and just coronavirus recovery; a global revival of Keynesian supply-side economics; and increasing interest in direct central bank funding of government stimulus programmes. In this essay I offer a first attempt to draw these elements together to suggest what might be a coherent strategy for action, at least for countries with stable, resilient currencies. One of the key elements would be for central banks to finance their governments’ decarbonization programmes directly by buying government bonds and holding them in perpetuity as insurance against misallocation of funds. The losers in such a strategy would be elements in the finance sector which have come to rely on virtually free bailouts and handouts from central banks via quantitative easing programmes.

627696,Predicting the COVID-19 infection with fourteen clinical features using machine learning classification algorithms,2021-01-07,"Developmental research typically relies on face-to-face testing at laboratories, childcare centers, museums or playgroups. Current social distancing measures have led to a halt in research. Although face-to-face interaction is considered essential for research involving young children, current technology provides viable alternatives. This paper introduces an accessible, replicable and easy to follow method to conduct online developmental research with young children employing a word-learning task as an exemplar, including a detailed workflow and step-by-step guide to using easily accessible programs and platforms. Four-year-old children's (N = 56) performance on a word-learning task delivered online vs. face-to-face is provided as a method validation. Children's performance on the word-learning task was predominantly consistent across delivery modes, with only slight variation in performance between modes. The implications of these similar results across face-to-face and online methods are discussed alongside avenues for further research. Importantly, this paper presents an emerging methodological approach for the online administration of developmental science both within and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, adding a new tool to current and future developmental scientist's toolkits.","Escudero, Paola; Pino Escobar, Gloria; Casey, Charlotte G.; Sommer, Kristyn",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.610975; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33776837/,438
629824,An initial accuracy focus reduces the effect of prior exposure on perceived accuracy of news headlines,2020-11-05,"Coronavirus (COVID-19) was first observed in Wuhan, China, and quickly propagated worldwide. It is considered the supreme crisis of the present era and one of the most crucial hazards threatening worldwide health. Therefore, the early detection of COVID-19 is essential. The common way to detect COVID-19 is the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, although it has several drawbacks. Computed tomography (CT) scans can enable the early detection of suspected patients, however, the overlap between patterns of COVID-19 and other types of pneumonia makes it difficult for radiologists to diagnose COVID-19 accurately. On the other hand, deep learning (DL) techniques and especially the convolutional neural network (CNN) can classify COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases. In addition, DL techniques that use CT images can deliver an accurate diagnosis faster than the RT-PCR test, which consequently saves time for disease control and provides an efficient computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system. The shortage of publicly available datasets of CT images, makes the CAD system’s design a challenging task. The CAD systems in the literature are based on either individual CNN or two-fused CNNs; one used for segmentation and the other for classification and diagnosis. In this article, a novel CAD system is proposed for diagnosing COVID-19 based on the fusion of multiple CNNs. First, an end-to-end classification is performed. Afterward, the deep features are extracted from each network individually and classified using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Next, principal component analysis is applied to each deep feature set, extracted from each network. Such feature sets are then used to train an SVM classifier individually. Afterward, a selected number of principal components from each deep feature set are fused and compared with the fusion of the deep features extracted from each CNN. The results show that the proposed system is effective and capable of detecting COVID-19 and distinguishing it from non-COVID-19 cases with an accuracy of 94.7%, AUC of 0.98 (98%), sensitivity 95.6%, and specificity of 93.7%. Moreover, the results show that the system is efficient, as fusing a selected number of principal components has reduced the computational cost of the final model by almost 32%.","Attallah, Omneya; Ragab, Dina A.; Sharkas, Maha",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33062453/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10086,438
631303,Viewpoint: Information systems research strategy,2020-08-08,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare professionals (HCPs) on the front lines against COVID-19 may face increased workload, and stress. Understanding HCPs’ risk for burnout is critical to supporting HCPs and maintaining the quality of healthcare during the pandemic. METHODS: To assess exposure, perceptions, workload, and possible burnout of HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic we conducted a cross-sectional survey. The main outcomes and measures were HCPs’ self-assessment of burnout and other experiences and attitudes associated with working during the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: A total of 2,707 HCPs from 60 countries participated in this study. Fifty-one percent of HCPs reported burnout. Burnout was associated with work impacting household activities (RR=1·57, 95% CI=1·39–1·78, P<0·001), feeling pushed beyond training (RR=1·32, 95% CI=1·20–1·47, P<0·001), exposure to COVID-19 patients (RR=1·18, 95% CI=1·05–1·32, P=0·005), making life prioritizing decisions (RR=1·16, 95% CI=1·02–1·31, P=0·03). Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) was protective against burnout (RR=0·88, 95% CI=0·79–0·97, P=0·01). Burnout was higher in high-income countries (HICs) compared to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (RR=1·18; 95% CI=1·02–1·36, P=0·018). INTERPRETATION: Burnout is prevalent at higher than previously reported rates among HCPs working during the COVID-19 pandemic and is related to high workload, job stress, and time pressure, and limited organizational support. Current and future burnout among HCPs could be mitigated by actions from healthcare institutions and other governmental and non-governmental stakeholders aimed at potentially modifiable factors, including providing additional training, organizational support, support for family, PPE, and mental health resources.

632668,VIRFIM: an AI and Internet of Medical Things-driven framework for healthcare using smart sensors,2021-09-02,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of a novel, on-eye UVA light-emitting contact lens device driven by fiber optics for the corneal crosslinking (CXL) of patients with keratoconus. METHODS: In nine corneal transplant candidates with advanced keratoconus a scleral contact lens reservoir containing 0.007% benzalkonium chloride preserved with 0.25% riboflavin-monophosphate was placed on the eye for 30 minutes. The reservoir lens was removed and replaced with the CXLens UVA light-emitting contact lens. A 375-nm UVA light at 4 mW/cm(2) intensity was delivered for 30 minutes for a dose of 7.2 J/cm(2). A one-sided paired t-test was used to evaluate mean differences in maximum keratometry, thinnest corneal thickness, and endothelial cell density between screening and 6 months after CXL. A two-sided paired t-test was used to evaluate differences in best-corrected distance visual acuity between screening and 6 months after CXL. RESULTS: All patients received the treatment as per protocol and adhered to follow-up testing. At 6 months after CXL, treated eyes had an average −1.0 ± 1.6 diopters decrease in the maximum keratometry (P = 0.049), a nonsignificant 2.3 ± 7.5 letter improvement in best-corrected distance visual acuity (P = 0.19), a nonsignificant −17 ± 14 µm decrease in thinnest corneal thickness (P < 0.01), and a nonsignificant −86 ± 266 cells/mm(2) decrease in endothelial cell density (P = 0.20). CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of the novel CXL device for the treatment of keratoconus and indicates the device is ready for larger scale studies with longer follow-up periods.

Making sense of the business environment",2020-10-31,"During the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, many countries took strong lockdown policy to reduce disease spreading, resulting in mitigating the ambient air pollution due to less traffic and industrial emissions. However, limited studies focused on the household air pollution especially in rural area, the potential risk induced by indoor air pollution exposure was unknown during this period. This field study continuously measured real-time PM(2.5) levels in kitchen, living room, and outdoor in the normal days (Period-1) and the days of COVID-19 lockdown overlapping the Chinese Spring Festival (Period-2) in rural homes in China. The average daily PM(2.5) concentrations increased by 17.4 and 5.1 μg/m(3) in kitchen and living room during Period-2, respectively, which may be due to more fuel consumption for cooking and heating caused by larger family sizes than those during the normal days. The ambient PM(2.5) concentration in rural areas in Period-2 decreased by 6.7 μg/m(3) compared to the Period-1, less than the drop in urban areas (26.8 μg/m(3)). An increase of mass fraction of very fine particles in ambient air was observed during lockdown overlapping annual festival days, which could be explained by the residential solid fuel burning. Due to higher indoor air pollution level and longer time spent in indoor environments, daily personal exposure to PM(2.5) was 134 ± 40 μg/m(3) in Period-2, which was significantly higher than that during in Period-1 (126 ± 27 μg/m(3), p < 0.05). The increase of personal PM(2.5) exposure during Period-2 could potentially have negative impact on human health, indicating further investigations should be performed to estimate the health impact of global COVID-19 lockdown on community, especially in rural homes using solid fuels as the routine fuels.","Du, Wei; Wang, Jinze; Wang, Zhenglu; Lei, Yali; Huang, Ye; Liu, Shijie; Wu, Can; Ge, Shuangshuang; Chen, Yuanchen; Bai, Kaixu; Wang, Gehui",Chemosphere,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653521008766?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33819885/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0045653521008766; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.130406,438
635530,Responsible Computing During COVID-19 and Beyond,2021,"BACKGROUND: Self-harm and suicidal behaviour are recognised as public health concerns. Prolonged social withdrawal behaviour, or hikikomori, is reported as a risk factor for suicidal behaviour. AIMS: To examine the occurrence and additional risk of prolonged social withdrawal behaviour on self-harm and suicidal behaviour among Chinese university students. METHOD: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted with three universities in southern China. A two-stage random sampling was adopted for recruitment, with students in different years of study, in different departments of each participating university. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate the sociodemographic and psychological correlates of self-harm and suicidal behaviours among male and female participants with hikikomori status. RESULTS: Of the students who completed the online survey, 1735 (72.23%) were included in the analysis; 11.5% (n = 200) reported self-harm behaviour and 11.8% (n = 204) reported suicidal behaviours in the past 12 months. Men showed a higher prevalence rate of self-harm than women (14.7% v. 10.8%, P = 0.048), but a similar rate of suicidal behaviours (11.9% v. 11.3%, P = 0.78). The overall prevalence rate of social withdrawal behaviour was 3.2% (7.0% for men and 2.3% for women, P < 0.001). Prolonged social withdrawal behaviour status was significantly associated with self-harm (odds ratio 2.00, 95% CI 1.22–3.29) and suicidal behaviour (odds ratio 2.35, 95% CI 1.45–3.81). However, the associations became statistically insignificant after adjustment for psychological factors in the final models in the logistic regression analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged social withdrawal behaviour appears to be associated with self-harm and suicidal behaviour, but psychological factors have stronger links with suicidality.","Zhu, Shimin; Lee, Paul H.; Wong, Paul W.

Methods: We applied an optimized search strategy across the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, PsycINFO, and four Chinese databases, with hand searching supplemented to identify relevant surveys. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were published in peer-reviewed literature and used a validated method to assess the prevalence and risk factors of mental health problems among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Heterogeneity was quantified using Q statistics and the I(2) statistics. The potential causes of heterogeneity were investigated using subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis. Sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the robustness of the results. Results: We pooled and analyzed data from 20 studies comprising 10,886 healthcare workers. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, post-traumatic stress symptoms, phobia, obsessive–compulsive symptoms, and somatization symptoms was 24.1, 28.6, 44.1, 25.6, 35.0, 16.2, and 10.7%, respectively. Female and nurses had a high prevalence of depression and anxiety. Frontline healthcare workers had a higher prevalence of anxiety and a lower prevalence of depression than the those in the second-line. Furthermore, the proportion of moderate–severe depression and anxiety is higher in the frontline. Additionally, four studies reported on risk factors of mental health problems. Conclusions: In this systematic review, healthcare workers have a relatively high prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, post-traumatic stress symptoms, phobia, obsessive–compulsive symptoms, and somatization symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, and focus should be on the healthcare workers at high risk of mental problems. Mental health problems in healthcare workers should be taken seriously, and timely screening and appropriate intervention for the high-risk group are highly recommended.

636470,Analysis of factors affecting IoT-based smart hospital design,2020-11-26,"Sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing is an important component of PrEP care. Home-based PrEP monitoring (HBPM), consisting of STI sample self-collection and remote follow-up, could improve PrEP access and retention rates, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. However, existing fingerstick methods for collecting blood often result in too little specimen for quantitative rapid plasma reagin (RPR) testing, limiting the ability to distinguish between old and new syphilis infections. We evaluated the Tasso OnDemand™ device, designed to collect 300 μg of capillary blood, for self-collecting blood specimens for PrEP monitoring, including quantitative syphilis testing.From July 2020 – January 2021, we enrolled 46 clients who were either on PrEP, had known/suspected new syphilis infection or were living with HIV and seeking STI care at a sexual health clinic in Seattle, WA, USA. After brief instruction, clients used the Tasso device in the clinic to self-collect blood from the upper arm. We compared HIV antigen/antibody, quantitative RPR and creatinine assay results using paired Tasso and venipuncture serum specimens.Most clients were cisgender men (42/46, 91%) and currently using PrEP (33/37, 89%). Of 46 participants, 40 (87%) collected a blood sample sufficient to complete ≥1 test. Percent positive agreement and negative percent agreement (PPA and NPA, respectively) for 34 HIV specimens was 100% (7/7 HIV positive). Of 30 paired qualitative RPR specimens, PPA was 100% (10/10 samples) and NPA was 95% (19/20 samples). Differences between 9 paired quantitative RPR titers were all ≤1 dilution. Paired creatinine results (n=9) were strongly and positively correlated (r²=0.84, p=0.008) with a median difference of 0.05 mg/dL (range: -0.01–0.20).Self-collection of blood specimens adequate for recommended PrEP laboratory testing is feasible and results show high levels of agreement with venipuncture samples.

This study aims to understand knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) concerning antibiotic use and resistance among university students in Bangladesh. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed from January to April 2020 among students at Jahangirnagar University (JU), Bangladesh. Purposive sampling was conducted through an in-person interview using a structured questionnaire. Students from the faculties of biological sciences and non-biology background were included. The univariate ordinal regression technique was used to analyze the relationship between predictors and good knowledge about the antibiotics. A two-tailed p-value was calculated to determine statistical association. RESULTS: Out of 205 study participants, 92 and 113 responders were from biological science faculty and non-biology disciplines, respectively. Less than half of the students (42.4%) showed a good knowledge level (scores higher than 80%). Biology-background students possess better knowledge than non-biology students [odds ratio (OR) = 4.44, 95% confidence level (CL) (2.56, 7.70), p < 0.001]. A better attitude was noticed among all students. The self-medication rate was quite low, and more than 90% of students were found to consume antibiotics according to the physician’s prescription. Lack of treatment adherence was recorded, and students admitted to stop-taking antibiotics when symptoms disappeared (48.67% biology and 36.26% non-biology). Multivariate regression analysis was unable to detect any significant association between self-medication and gender, student category or the level of knowledge about antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Students of biological science background possessed better knowledge indicating the importance of appropriate curriculum imparted in knowledge buildup. Introducing a short course about the risk and development of antibiotic resistance will grow the students’ awareness to avoid the resistance phenomenon.","Marzan, Mahfuza; Islam, Dewan Zubaer; Lugova, Halyna; Krishnapillai, Ambigga; Haque, Mainul; Islam, Salequl",Infect Drug Resist,https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s289964; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33603416/,438

As the prognosis of PCa continues to improve, the increasing follow-up requirements after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy puts significant pressure on health care systems. Follow-up is typically conducted by treating urologists, specialized nurses, or general practitioners. Despite the increase in patient numbers, resources are not likely to increase in proportion. Furthermore, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to a paradigm shift in our thinking towards telehealth solutions, primarily to avoid or limit physical contact and to spare resources. Here we report our novel telehealth solution for PCa follow-up, called Mobile PSA. Currently, more than 4500 PCa patients have been using Mobile PSA follow-up in our center. Mobile PSA can increase follow-up accuracy, as all biochemical relapses will be detected in a timely manner, can significantly reduce delays in reporting prostate-specific antigen results to patients, and can significantly reduce costs. PATIENT SUMMARY: We assessed a new telehealth information system for prostate cancer follow-up that does not use an app. More than 4500 prostate cancer patients in our center have used this system, called Mobile PSA, for follow-up. The system significantly reduces delays in reporting prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test results to patients, increases the accuracy of detecting recurrence of elevated PSA, and reduces costs.","Bergroth, Robin; Matikainen, Mika; Rannikko, Antti",Eur Urol Open Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euros.2021.04.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34337524/,438

METHOD The study included 940 team athletes, 274 individual athletes, and 131 nonathlete controls aged 12-17 years. Demographic data were obtained with a form including questions about age, sex, sports type, and physical activity status (type, duration, and frequency) during the isolation period. Participants completed the Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale-13, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children. RESULTS Among participants, 88% did not meet the physical activity recommendations for children and adolescents, while 42.8% felt depressed. Depressive symptoms were present in 38.1% of boys and 59.7% of girls, with girls (6.4%) having higher posttraumatic stress symptoms than boys (3.5%). Among athletes, depressive and anxiety symptoms were lower compared with nonathlete controls (P < .01). Posttraumatic stress symptoms were lower among athletes than nonathlete controls for girls (team vs control, P = .006; individual vs control, P = .002) but similar for boys (P > .05). The depression (P = .518), state (P = .866), and trait anxiety (P = .507) symptoms were similar between team athletes and individual athletes.

In absence of any effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), remdesivir has been tried for a compassionate use in severe COVID-19. Newer randomized controlled studies that have recently become available, showed a mixed result. We aimed to systematically search the literature to understand the pharmacology and clinical effects of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed, ClinicalTrial.Org and MedRxiv database up till May 5, 2020 using specific key words such as “Remdesivir” or ‘GS-5734″ AND “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2” and retrieved all the article published in English language, that have reported the pharmacology and the clinical outcomes of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Initial compassionate use of remdesivir has shown a fairly good result, but difficult to quantify, in the absence of control arm. While the very first double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial conducted in Wuhan, did not find any significant benefit compared to the control, the preliminary result of another similar multi-country trial has shown a significant faster time to recovery but without any difference in mortality.

641183,Analysis of the mitigation strategies for COVID-19: from mathematical modelling perspective,2020-06-05,"During the epidemic of COVID‐19, Computed Tomography (CT) is used to help in the diagnosis of patients. Most current studies on this subject appear to be focused on broad and private annotated data which are impractical to access from an organization, particularly while radiologists are fighting the coronavirus disease. It is challenging to equate these techniques since they were built on separate datasets, educated on various training sets, and tested using different metrics. In this research, a deep learning semantic segmentation architecture for COVID‐19 lesions detection in limited chest CT datasets will be presented. The proposed model architecture consists of the encoder and the decoder components. The encoder component contains three layers of convolution and pooling, while the decoder contains three layers of deconvolutional and upsampling. The dataset consists of 20 CT scans of lungs belongs to 20 patients from two sources of data. The total number of images in the dataset is 3520 CT scans with its labelled images. The dataset is split into 70% for the training phase and 30% for the testing phase. Images of the dataset are passed through the pre‐processing phase to be resized and normalized. Five experimental trials are conducted through the research with different images selected for the training and the testing phases for every trial. The proposed model achieves 0.993 in the global accuracy, and 0.987, 0.799, 0.874 for weighted IoU, mean IoU and mean BF score accordingly. The performance metrics such as precision, sensitivity, specificity and F1 score strengthens the obtained results. The proposed model outperforms the related works which use the same dataset in terms of performance and IoU metrics.","Khalifa, Nour Eldeen M.; Manogaran, Gunasekaran; Taha, Mohamed Hamed N.; Loey, Mohamed",Expert Syst,https://doi.org/10.1111/exsy.12742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177038/,438

Though individuals with a history of insomnia may be especially vulnerable during stressful life events, risk may be mitigated by prior intervention. This study evaluated the effect of prior digital cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) versus sleep education on health resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: COVID impact, insomnia, general- and COVID-related stress, depression, and global health were assessed in April 2020 in adults with a history of insomnia who completed a randomized controlled trial of dCBT-I (n = 102) versus sleep education control (n = 106) in 2016–2017. Regression analyses were used to evaluate the effect of intervention conditions on subsequent stress and health during the pandemic. RESULTS: Insomnia symptoms were significantly associated with COVID-19 related disruptions, and those who previously received dCBT-I reported less insomnia symptoms, less general stress and COVID-related cognitive intrusions, less depression, and better global health than those who received sleep education. Moreover, the odds for resurgent insomnia was 51% lower in the dCBT-I versus control condition. Similarly, odds of moderate to severe depression during COVID-19 was 57% lower in the dCBT-I condition. CONCLUSIONS: Those who received dCBT-I had increased health resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic in adults with a history of insomnia and ongoing mild to moderate mental health symptoms. These data provide evidence that dCBT-I is a powerful tool to promote mental and physical health during stressors, including the COVID-19 pandemic.

The plant kingdom has demonstrated to be an important source of new molecules with antiviral potential. Purpose The present study aims to utilize various computational tools to identify the most eligible drug candidate that have capabilities to halt the replication of SARS-COV-2 virus by inhibiting Main protease (Mpro) enzyme Methods We have selected plants whose extracts have inhibitory potential against previously discovered coronaviruses. Their phytoconstituents were surveyed and a library of 100 molecules was prepared. Then, computational tools such as molecular docking, ADMET and molecular dynamic simulations were utilized to screen the compounds and evaluate them against Mpro enzyme. Results All the phytoconstituents showed good binding affinities towards Mpro enzyme. Among them laurolitsine possesses the highest binding affinity i.e. -294.1533 kcal/mol. On ADMET analysis of best three ligands were simulated for 1.2 ns, then the stable ligand among them was further simulated for 20 ns. Results revealed that no conformational changes were observed in the laurolitsine w.r.t. protein residues and low RMSD value suggested that the Laurolitsine-protein complex was stable for 20ns. Conclusion Laurolitsine, an active constituent of roots of Lindera aggregata, was found to be having good ADMET profile and have capabilities to halt the activity of the enzyme. Therefore, this makes laurolitsine a good drug candidate for the treatment of COVID-19.","Kumar, Nitish; Singh, Atamjit; Gulati, Harmandeep Kaur; Bhagat, Kavita; Kaur, Komalpreet; Kaur, Jaspreet; dudhal, Shilpa; Duggal, Amit; Gulati, Puja; Singh, Harbinder; Singh, Jatinder Vir; Bedi, Preet Mohinder Singh",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667031321000658?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2667031321000658,438

OBJECTIVES: To present the contributions of a Swiss pharmacy of an academic outpatient care department (Unisanté) to the prevention of COVID-19 transmission and the precautionary measures plan implemented as well as to evaluate the impact of Swiss semicontainment on its pharmacy services. METHODS: Contributions to COVID-19 transmission prevention and the precautionary measures plan are described. The impact on pharmacy services was measured by quantitative comparison before, during and after semicontainment. RESULTS: The pharmacy supplied protective equipment to the population and to liberal healthcare professionals and provided COVID-19 recommendations to patients and community pharmacies. The precautionary measures plan implemented required a reorganization of the premises, facilities, staff operation and pharmacy services. Semicontainment had a strong impact on pharmacy services; however, clinical bonds with patients and other healthcare professionals were maintained. Unseen negative impacts may exist and need to be investigated.

Therefore, we monitored the time course of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in raw sewage in the Frankfurt metropolitan area, the European financial center. To determine the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in sewage, we continuously collected 24 h composite samples twice a week from two wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influents (Niederrad and Sindlingen) serving the Frankfurt metropolitan area and performed RT-qPCR analysis targeting three genes (N gene, S gene, and ORF1ab gene). In August, a resurgence in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was observed, reaching 3 × 10(13) copies/day, which represented similar levels compared to April with approx. 2 × 10(14) copies/day. This corresponds to a continuous increase again in COVID-19 cases in Frankfurt since August, with an average of 28.6 incidences, compared to 28.7 incidences in April. Different temporal dynamics were observed between different sampling points, indicating local dynamics in COVID-19 cases within the Frankfurt metropolitan area. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA load to the WWTP Niederrad ranged from approx. 4 × 10(11) to 1 × 10(15) copies/day, the load to the WWTP Sindlingen from approx. 1 × 10(11) to 2 × 10(14) copies/day, which resulted in a preceding increase in these loading in July ahead of the weekly averaged incidences.

It is shown that whole cervical lymph node cells did not proliferate in vitro in the presence of soluble mycobacterial antigens (PPD or leprosin) despite being responsive to whole mycobacteria. Besides, T cells from these lymph nodes separated as a non-adherent fraction on a nylon wool column, proliferated to PPD in the presence of autologous antigen presenting cells. Interestingly, addition of as low as 20% nylon wool adherent cells to these, sharply decreased the proliferation by 83%. Looking into what cells in the adherent fraction suppressed the proliferation, it was found that neither the T cell nor the macrophage enriched cell fractions of this population individually showed suppressive effect, indicating that their co-presence was necessary for the suppression. Since BCG induced granulomas resolve much faster than granulomas induced by other mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae the present experimental findings add to the existing evidence that intradermal BCG vaccination influences subsequent immune responses in the host and may further stress upon its beneficial role seen in Covid-19 patients.","Vergkizi, Souzan; Nikolakakis, Ioannis",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.10.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33071000/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X20312846; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X20312846,438

We compared plasma from healthy age-matched controls (n = 26) with SARS-CoV-2 negative non-hospitalized respiratory patients and hospitalized respiratory patients (n = 23 and 11 respectively) with SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR positive respiratory patients (n = 17, with longitudinal sampling time-points). DIRE data were modelled using principal component analysis and orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (O-PLS-DA), with statistical cross-validation indices indicating excellent model generalization for the classification of SARS-CoV-2 positivity for all comparator groups (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve = 1). DIRE spectra show biomarker signal combinations conferred by differential concentrations of metabolites with selected molecular mobility properties. These comprise the following: (a) composite N-acetyl signals from α-1-acid glycoprotein and other glycoproteins (designated GlycA and GlycB) that were elevated in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients [p = 2.52 × 10(–10) (GlycA) and 1.25 × 10(–9) (GlycB) vs controls], (b) two diagnostic supramolecular phospholipid composite signals that were identified (SPC-A and SPC-B) from the –(+)N–(CH(3))(3) choline headgroups of lysophosphatidylcholines carried on plasma glycoproteins and from phospholipids in high-density lipoprotein subfractions (SPC-A) together with a phospholipid component of low-density lipoprotein (SPC–B). The integrals of the summed SPC signals (SPC(total)) were reduced in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients relative to both controls (p = 1.40 × 10(–7)) and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (p = 4.52 × 10(–8)) but were not significantly different between controls and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. The identity of the SPC signal components was determined using one and two dimensional diffusional, relaxation, and statistical spectroscopic experiments. The SPC(total)/GlycA ratios were also significantly different for control versus SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (p = 1.23 × 10(–10)) and for SARS-CoV-2 negatives versus positives (p = 1.60 × 10(–9)). Thus, plasma SPC(total) and SPC(total)/GlycA are proposed as sensitive molecular markers for SARS-CoV-2 positivity that could effectively augment current COVID-19 diagnostics and may have value in functional assessment of the disease recovery process in patients with long-term symptoms.","Lodge, Samantha; Nitschke, Philipp; Kimhofer, Torben; Wist, Julien; Bong, Sze-How; Loo, Ruey Leng; Masuda, Reika; Begum, Sofina; Richards, Toby; Lindon, John C.; Bermel, Wolfgang; Reinsperger, Tony; Schaefer, Hartmut; Spraul, Manfred; Holmes, Elaine; Nicholson, Jeremy K.",Anal Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33577736/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c04952,438

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the imaging findings of patients confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia who had chest CT scanning and treatment after disease onset. The clinical and imaging data were analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty patients were enrolled, including mild type in nine, common in 28, severe in 10 and critically severe in the rest three. Mild patients (29 years) were significantly (P<0.03) younger than either common (44.5 years) or severe (54.7) and critically severe (65.7 years) patients, and common patients were also significantly (P<0.03) younger than severe and critically severe patients. Mild patients had low to moderate fever (<39.1 °C), 49 (98%) patients had normal or slightly reduced leukocyte count, 14 (28%) had decreased counts of lymphocytes, and 26 (52%) patients had increased C-reactive protein. Nine mild patients were negative in CT imaging. For all the other types of NCP, the lesion was in the right upper lobe in 30 cases, right middle lobe in 22, right lower lobe in 39, left upper lobe in 33 and left lower lobe in 36. The lesion was primarily located in the peripheral area under the pleura with possible extension towards the pulmonary hilum. Symmetrical lesions were seen in 26 cases and asymmetrical in 15. The density of lesion was mostly uneven with ground glass opacity as the primary presentation accompanied by partial consolidation and fibrosis. CONCLUSION: CT imaging presentations of NCP are mostly patchy ground glass opacities in the peripheral areas under the pleura with partial consolidation which will be absorbed with formation of fibrotic stripes if improved. CT scanning provides important bases for early diagnosis and treatment of NCP.","Xu, Yu-Huan; Dong, Jing-Hui; An, Wei-Min; Lv, Xiao-Yan; Yin, Xiao-Ping; Zhang, Jian-Zeng; Dong, Li; Ma, Xi; Zhang, Hong-Jie; Gao, Bu-Lang",J Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32109443/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320301006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320301006; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.017,438

The generations of the epidemic spread are not well known, yet these are critical parameters to facilitate an understanding of the epidemic. A seafood wholesale market and Wuhan city, China, were recognized as the primary and secondary epidemic sources. Human movements nationwide from the two epidemic sources revealed the characteristics of the first-generation and second-generation spreads of the COVID-19 epidemic, as well as the potential third-generation spread. Methods We used spatiotemporal data of COVID-19 cases in mainland China and two categories of location-based service (LBS) data of mobile devices from the primary and secondary epidemic sources to calculate Pearson correlation coefficient,r, and spatial stratified heterogeneity, q, statistics. Results Two categories of device trajectories had generally significant correlations and determinant powers of the epidemic spread. Bothr and q statistics decreased with distance from the epidemic sources and their associations changed with time. At the beginning of the epidemic, the mixed first-generation and second-generation spreads appeared in most cities with confirmed cases. They strongly interacted to enhance the epidemic in Hubei province and the trend was also significant in the provinces adjacent to Hubei. The third-generation spread started in Wuhan from January 17 to 20, 2020, and in Hubei from January 23 to 24. No obvious third-generation spread was detected outside Hubei. Conclusions The findings provide important foundations to quantify the effect of human movement on epidemic spread and inform ongoing control strategies. The spatiotemporal association between the epidemic spread and human movements from the primary and secondary epidemic sources indicates a transfer from second to third generations of the infection. Urgent control measures include preventing the potential third-generation spread in mainland China, eliminating it in Hubei, and reducing the interaction influence of first-generation and second-generation spreads.","Hu, Bisong; Qiu, Jingyu; Chen, Haiying; Tao, Vincent; Wang, Jinfeng; Lin, Hui",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425632/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.05.048; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220303556?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220303556,438

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to demonstrate the association of elevated IL-6 with severe Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). A total of 9 studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Patients with severe COVID-19 had a significantly higher serum IL-6 levels compared to non-severe patients (mean difference (MD): 38.6 pg/mL, 95% CI: 24.3 - 52.9 pg/mL, p <0.001, I2 = 98.5%). On meta-regression, increasing mean IL-6 level was associated with increased mortality in patients (Coefficient (Q): 0.01, 95% CI: 0.01-0.03, p = 0.03). Given the association of elevated IL-6 with severe COVID-19 and mortality, clinicians should use this as a potential marker to recognize severe disease. IL-6 should be incorporated in a scoring system along with other inflammatory markers to risk stratify the patients for early recognition of severe disease.

The theoretical calculations of the mentioned compound have been carried out using the more popular density functional theory method, Becke-3-Parameter-Lee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP) in 6-31G+(d,p) basis set. The computational results of the compound were compared with the obtained experimental value. Moreover, the highest occupied molecular orbital, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, molecular electrostatic potential, chemical reactivity parameters and natural bond orbital of the optimized structure have been evaluated at the same level of theory. Furthermore, the UV–Vis spectrum of the compound has been carried out for the better understanding of electronic absorption spectra with the help of the time-dependent density functional theory at room temperature. Besides, the molecular docking simulation of the mentioned molecule with target protein was also investigated. In addition, in silico studies were performed to predict absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity profiles of the designed compound. The results indicated that the theoretical data have well correlated with the observed values. The narrow frontier orbital gap indicated that the eventual charge transfer interaction occurs within the studied molecule and showed high chemical reactivity. The global reactivity values showed that the compound is soft molecule, electrophilic species and has strong binding ability with biomolecules. The molecular electrostatic potential structure indicated that the negative and positive potential sites are around electronegative atoms and hydrogen atoms of studied compound, respectively. The natural bond orbital data revealed that the compound contains 97.42% Lewis and 2.58% non-Lewis structure. The intra and inter-molecular charge transfers process occur within the studied compound. The studied compound showed more binding energy (−6.0 kcal/mol) with target protein than hydroxychloroquine (−5.6 kcal/mol). The absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity investigation predicted that the compound has good drug like character.","Mumit, Mohammad Abdul; Pal, Tarun Kumar; Alam, Md Ashraful; Islam, Md Al-Amin-Al-Azadul; Paul, Subrata; Sheikh, Md Chanmiya",J Mol Struct,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834109/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022286020310401?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2020.128715; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022286020310401,438

Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Tertiary-care academic medical center in a metropolitan city. Patients or Participants Women undergoing OB/GYN ED consults or surgical procedures. Interventions March 16th institutional COVID-19 mandate to hold all elective surgeries. Measurements and Main Results The volume and types of surgical cases and ED consults were compared before and after the COVID-19 mandate. During the pandemic, the volume of ED consults and GYN surgeries significantly decreased, while OB surgeries remained stable. The average weekly case volume for ED consults, GYN surgeries, and OB surgeries were 44.8, 34.8, and 38.6 cases respectively during the “pre-COVID” timeframe (February 1st to March 15th) versus 17.8, 7.2, and 40.9 cases respectively during the “post-COVID” timeframe (March 16th toApril 15th), representing a 60.3% decrease in ED consults (p=<0.01) and a 79.3% decrease in GYN surgical volume (p=<0.01). The distribution of GYN surgical case types also changed significantly during the pandemic with higher proportions of emergent surgeries for ectopics, miscarriages, and concern for cancer (p <0.001). Alternatively, the OB surgical volume and distribution of OB surgical case types remained relatively constant. Conclusion This study highlights how the pandemic has impacted the ways OB/GYN patients access and receive care. The OB surgeries remained stable during the COVID-19 pandemic reflecting the non-elective and time-sensitive nature of obstetric care. In contrast, ED consults and GYN surgeries decreased significantly. As expected, institutional policies suspending elective surgeries affected the volume and types of GYN surgeries performed during the pandemic, and the “stay-at-home” policy and personal fears of COVID-19 infection likely affected ED consult volumes.","Spurlin, E.

The main objective of the Biathlon Injury and Illness Study (BIIS) is to provide the first comprehensive epidemiological profile of injury and illness in biathlon athletes during two consecutive Biathlon World Cup seasons over 2-years. METHODS: The BIIS study methodology is established in line with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) injury and illness surveillance protocols using a biathlon-specific injury and illness report form. Team medical staff will provide weekly data using injury and illness definitions of any injury or illness that receives medical attention regardless of time loss. Injuries or illness must be diagnosed and reported by a qualified medical professional (eg, team physician, physiotherapist) to ensure accurate and reliable diagnoses. Descriptive statistics will be used to identify the type, body region and nature of the injury or illness and athlete demographics such as age and gender. Summary measures of injury and illnesses per 1000 athlete-days will be calculated whereby the total number of athletes will be multiplied by the number of days in the season to calculate athlete-days.

Si la majorité des formes sont bénignes, les patients atteints de cancer sont à risque de voir se développer une forme grave de la maladie. Les services de radiothérapie sont un lieu à potentiel de contamination en raison du nombre de patients traités et de personnels présent. Leur organisation pendant la période épidémique vise à assurer la continuité des soins tout en limitant le risque de décès dû à une contamination par le SARS-CoV-2 (virus responsable de la COVID-19). Dans le service de radiothérapie du groupe hospitalier de la région de Mulhouse et Sud-Alsace, cette organisation s’articule en cinq points : la protection des personnels médicaux et paramédicaux, la protection des patients en cours de traitement, la détection des patients suspects d’être atteints de COVID-19 et leur prise en charge, la réorganisation du circuit patient et les mesures concernant l’organisation du système qualité du service. Nos pistes de réflexion, débutée dès le début de l’épidémie dans notre département, nous permettent de préserver au maximum l’accès aux soins radiothérapiques en anticipant le risque de diffusion du virus.

Summary The COVID-19 outbreak grows exponentially in our country. Despite most of patients develops benign symptoms, cancer patients are at risk of a severe form of the disease. Radiotherapy centres are a potential contamination place due to the number of patients treated and staff present. Their organization during the outbreak period aims to ensure continuity of care while limiting the risk of death from COVID-19. In the radiotherapy department of Mulhouse hospital (France), we pointed five points out: protection of medical and paramedical staff, protection of patients undergoing treatment, detection of patients suspected of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 and their management, reorganization of the patient circuit and measures regarding the quality management. This reflection, which began at the beginning of the outbreak in our city, allows us to preserve the access to radiotherapy treatments by anticipating the risk of spreading the virus. Through biweekly meetings, we continue to adapt to the epidemic in our department, considering our material resources. The ability to perform diagnostic tests in all suspect patients would also allow us to refine our procedures.","Ohnleiter, Thomas; Piot, Luc; Rogenmuser, Agathe; Noirclerc, Monique; Hamlaoui, Rabah; Grandgirard, Alain",Cancer Radiother,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canrad.2020.04.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1278321820300974; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1278321820300974?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32334905/,438

Clinical trials indicate the gaining impetus of peptide vaccines against diseases for which an effective treatment still remains obscure. CD4 T-cell-based peptide vaccines involve immunization with antigenic determinants from pathogens or neoplastic cells that possess the ability to elicit a robust T helper cell response, which subsequently activates other arms of the immune system. The available in silico predictors of human leukocyte antigen II (HLA-II) binding peptides are sequence-based techniques, which ostensibly have balanced sensitivity and specificity. Structural analysis and understanding of the cognate peptide and HLA-II interactions are essential to empirically derive a successful peptide vaccine. However, the availability of structure-based epitope prediction algorithms is inadequate compared with sequence-based prediction methods. The present study is an attempt to understand the structural aspects of HLA-II binders by analyzing the Protein Data Bank (PDB) complexes of pHLA-II. Furthermore, we mimic the peptide exchange mechanism and demonstrate the structural implication of an acidic environment on HLA-II binders. Finally, we discuss a structure-guided approach to decipher potential HLA-II binders within an antigenic protein. This strategy may accurately predict the peptide epitopes and thus aid in designing successful peptide vaccines.","Chatterjee, Deepyan; Priyadarshini, Pragya; Das, Deepjyoti K.; Mushtaq, Khurram; Singh, Balvinder; Agrewala, Javed N.",J Proteome Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33103906/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00405,438

However, existing data are limited largely to depression, and confounding variables have not always been controlled for. We sought to fill the evidence gap, using TriNetX Analytics, an electronic health records network. Amongst 58.6 million patients aged 18–90 years, patients prescribed a calcium channel blocker (CCB) were compared with those taking a diuretic, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), or β-blocker. Cohorts were propensity score-matched for age, sex, race, and blood pressure. Over a 2-year exposure period, we measured the incidence and risk ratio of a first diagnosis (ICD-10 codes), or a recurrence, of psychotic, affective, and anxiety disorders, as well as substance use disorders and sleep disorders. Cohort sizes ranged from 33,734 to 322,814. CCBs were associated with a lower incidence of psychotic, affective, and anxiety disorders than β-blockers (risk ratios 0.69–0.99) and a higher incidence than ARBs (risk ratios 1.04–2.23) for both first and recurrent diagnoses. Comparisons of CCBs with ACEIs or diuretics showed smaller risk ratios that varied between disorders, and between first episode and recurrence. AHT classes were also associated with the incidence of substance use and sleep disorders. Results remained largely unchanged after more extensive cohort matching for additional potential confounders. In a secondary analysis, a comparison between ARBs and ACEIs showed lower rates of psychotic, affective, and substance use disorders with ARBs, but higher risks of anxiety and sleep disorders. In conclusion, AHT classes are differentially associated with the incidence of psychiatric disorders. ARBs show the most advantageous profile and β-blockers the least. The apparent beneficial effects of ARBs merit further study.","Colbourne, Lucy; Luciano, Sierra; Harrison, Paul J.",Transl Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34039956/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01444-1,438

To this end, LAB strains selected on the basis of previous in vitro trials were co-incubated with cell line monolayers, which were subsequently challenged with rotavirus (RV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). In order to elucidate the possible mechanism responsible for the antiviral activity, the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) release as well as the attachment ability of LAB on the cell lines was investigated. Various strains were found to exhibit moderate to complete monolayer protection against viral RV or TGEV disruption. Highest protection effects were recorded with the known probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus casei Shirota against both RV and TGEV, while notable antiviral activity was also attributed to Enterococcus faecium PCK38, Lactobacillus fermentum ACA-DC179, Lactobacillus pentosus PCA227 and Lactobacillus plantarum PCA236 and PCS22, depending on the cell line and virus combination used. A variable increase (of up to 50%) on the release of NO(−) and H(2)O(2) (ROS) was obtained when LAB strains were co-incubated with the cell lines, but the results were found to be LAB strain and cell line specific, apart from a small number of strains which were able to induce strong ROS release in more than one cell line. In contrast, the ability of the examined LAB strains to attach to the cell line monolayers was LAB strain but not cell line specific. Highest attachment ability was observed with L. plantarum ACA-DC 146, L. paracasei subsp. tolerans ACA-DC 4037 and E. faecium PCD71. Clear indications on the nature of the antiviral effect were evident only in the case of the L. casei Shirota against TGEV and with L. plantarum PCA236 againt both RV and TGEV. In the rest of the cases, each interaction was LAB-cell line–virus specific, barring general conclusions. However, it is probable that more than one mechanism is involved in the antiviral effect described here. Further investigations are required to elucidate the underlying mode of action and to develop a cell line model as a system for selection of probiotic strains suited for farm animal applications.","Maragkoudakis, Petros A.; Chingwaru, Walter; Gradisnik, Lidija; Tsakalidou, Effie; Cencic, Avrelija",Int J Food Microbiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160509006771; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2009.12.024; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168160509006771; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20106541/,438
671368,Editorial.,2021-08-01,"In the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) era, point-of-care lung ultrasound (LUS) has attracted increased attention. Prospective studies on LUS for the assessment of pneumonia in adult patients were extensively carried out for more than 10 years before this era. None of these prospective studies attempted to differentiate bacterial and viral pneumonia in adult patients using LUS. The majority of studies considered the LUS examination to be positive if sonographic consolidations or multiple B-lines were observed. Significant differences existed in the accuracy of these studies. Some studies revealed that LUS showed superior sensitivity to chest X-ray. These results indicate that point-of-care LUS has the potential to be an initial imaging modality for the diagnosis of pneumonia. The LUS diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia in intensive care units is more challenging in comparison with the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia in emergency departments due to the limited access to the mechanically ventilated patients and the high prevalence of atelectasis. However, several studies have demonstrated that the combination of LUS findings with other clinical markers improved the diagnostic accuracy. In the COVID-19 era, many case reports and small observational studies on COVID-19 pneumonia have been published in a short period. Multiple B-lines were the most common and consistent finding in COVID-19 pneumonia. Serial LUS showed the deterioration of the disease. The knowledge and ideas on the application of LUS in the management of pneumonia that are expected to accumulate in the COVID-19 era may provide us with clues regarding more appropriate management.","Kameda, Toru; Mizuma, Yoshihiro; Taniguchi, Hayato; Fujita, Masato; Taniguchi, Nobuyuki",J Med Ultrason (2001),https://doi.org/10.1007/s10396-020-01074-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33438132/,438

METHODS: Self-reported data from a migraine tracking smartphone application, Migraine Buddy, were used. Data were collected from users who reported at least one attack in the Jan, Feb, Mar and Apr of 2018, 2019 and 2020. In addition, a survey was conducted to evaluate the impact of COVID‐19 on migraine management. RESULTS: On average, data from 124,717 users per month (mean age 36.3 ± 10.9 years and 89% female) were collected. Overall, the mean frequency of migraine headache was higher in 2020 than in 2019 and higher in 2019 than in 2018. The four commonest headache triggers in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were stress in 39.7, 38.4 and 36.1%, lack of sleep in 25, 25 and 22.8%, neck pain, 20, 20.4 and 19.3 and anxiety in 19, 18.4 and 18.4% of participants, respectively. 1689 users participated in the survey and they reported that they preferred face-to-face (54.29%) to telehealth (11.9%) consultations. CONCLUSION: An increase in migraine frequency from 2018 to 2020 was reported by the users of the mobile phone. This could reflect a real increase or change in reporting habits. Stress, lack of sleep, neck pain and anxiety were the commonest attack triggers. The frequency of these triggers decreased slightly in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018.

674143,COVID_SCREENET: COVID-19 Screening in Chest Radiography Images Using Deep Transfer Stacking,2021-03-17,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated autophagy plays significant roles in replication and pathogenesis of many animal viruses. However, the relationship between ER stress, autophagy, and viral replication during in vivo and in vitro infection of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) remains unclear. In this study, we established a pig model for CSFV infection and found that viral loads of CSFV differed in 10 kinds of infected organs, and that the degree of tissue lesions was to some extent positively correlated with CSFV replication in vivo. Next, we found that CSFV infection not only induced ER stress and subsequently activated three unfolded protein responses (UPR) pathways including protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor-6 (ATF-6) pathways, but also triggered complete autophagy in main immune organs and partial nonimmune organs exhibiting severer pathological injuries and higher viral loads. However, only the IRE1 pathway and no autophagy were activated in some other nonimmune organs with slighter pathologies and lower viral loads. These results indicate a potential link between CSFV-induced ER stress and autophagy, both of which are associated with the CSFV replication in vivo. We further performed in vitro experiments and found that CSFV infection activates the PERK and IRE1 pathways and autophagy in cultured porcine kidney cell lines (PK-15) and macrophage cell lines (3D4/2), and pharmacological regulation of ER stress remarkably changed autophagic activities induced by CSFV, suggesting that CSFV-induced autophagy can be mediated by ER stress possibly via the PERK and IRE1 pathway. Furthermore, treatment with ER stress regulators significantly altered copy numbers of NS5B genes, expression of Npro proteins, and viral titers in CSFV-infected cells or in cells treated with autophagy regulators prior to CSFV infection, suggesting the requirement of ER stress-mediated autophagy for CSFV replication in vitro. Collectively, our data demonstrate that CSFV induces ER stress-mediated autophagy to sustain its replication in vivo and in vitro, which may be one of the potential strategies exploited by CSFV for immune evasion. This finding will provide new insights into mechanisms of replication and pathogenesis of CSFV, and development of new strategies for controlling CSF.","Zhu, Erpeng; Chen, Wenxian; Qin, Yuwei; Ma, Shengming; Fan, Shuangqi; Wu, Keke; Li, Wenhui; Fan, Jindai; Yi, Lin; Ding, Hongxing; Chen, Jinding; Zhao, Mingqiu",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31798542/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.02545,438

674490,Interdisciplinary Research in Artificial Intelligence: Challenges and Opportunities,2020-11-23,"Bioinformatics is a dynamic research area in which a large number of algorithms and programs have been developed rapidly and independently without much consideration so far of the need for standardization. The lack of such common standards combined with unfriendly interfaces make it difficult for biologists to learn how to use these tools and to translate the data formats from one to another. Consequently, the construction of an integrative bioinformatics platform to facilitate biologists’ research is an urgent and challenging task. KDE Bioscience is a java-based software platform that collects a variety of bioinformatics tools and provides a workflow mechanism to integrate them. Nucleotide and protein sequences from local flat files, web sites, and relational databases can be entered, annotated, and aligned. Several home-made or 3rd-party viewers are built-in to provide visualization of annotations or alignments. KDE Bioscience can also be deployed in client-server mode where simultaneous execution of the same workflow is supported for multiple users. Moreover, workflows can be published as web pages that can be executed from a web browser. The power of KDE Bioscience comes from the integrated algorithms and data sources. With its generic workflow mechanism other novel calculations and simulations can be integrated to augment the current sequence analysis functions.

677501,Cloud-to-end Rendering and Storage Management for Virtual Reality in Experimental Education,2020-08-31,"This is the second in a two‐part review of diagnostic cytopathology in veterinary medicine. As in human medicine, cytopathology is a minimally invasive, rapid, and cost‐effective diagnostic modality with broad utilization. In this second part, the diagnostic applications of cytology in respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, endocrine, ocular, and central nervous system tissues are discussed with a section describing fluid analysis in veterinary medicine. As noted in the previous manuscript, which characterized the cytology of the skin/subcutis, musculoskeletal, and lymphoid tissues, the interpretation of veterinary cytology samples must be undertaken with extensive knowledge of the breadth of animal species, including familiarity with the frequency and clinical progression of diseases, both of which can be influenced by species, breed, and husbandry conditions. Similar to part one, this review focuses on the most common domestic companion animal species (dog, cat, and horse) and highlights lesions that are either unique to veterinary species or have relevant correlates in people. The cytologic features and biological behavior of similar lesions are compared, and selected mechanisms of disease and ancillary diagnostics are reviewed when appropriate. Supporting figures illustrate a subset of lesions. While not an exhaustive archive of veterinary cytology, the goal is to give cytopathologists working in human medicine a general impression of correlates and unique entities in veterinary practice.

Methods Saliva samples from 103 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (15 asymptomatic and 88 symptomatic) were collected on the day of hospital admission. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva was detected using a quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) laboratory-developed test (LDT), a cobas SARS-CoV-2 high-throughput system, three direct RT-qPCR kits, and reverse-transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). Viral antigen was detected by a rapid antigen immunochromatographic assay. Results Of the 103 samples, viral RNA was detected in 50.5-81.6% of the specimens by molecular diagnostic tests and an antigen was detected in 11.7% of the specimens by the rapid antigen test. Viral RNA was detected at a significantly higher percentage (65.6-93.4%) in specimens collected within 9 d of symptom onset compared to that of specimens collected after at least 10 d of symptom onset (22.2-66.7%) and that of asymptomatic patients (40.0-66.7%). Viral RNA was more frequently detected in saliva from males than females. Conclusions Self-collected saliva is an alternative specimen diagnosing COVID-19. LDT RT-qPCR, cobas SARS-CoV-2 high-throughput system, direct RT-qPCR except for one commercial kit, and RT-LAMP showed sufficient sensitivity in clinical use to be selectively used according to clinical settings and facilities. The rapid antigen test alone is not recommended for initial COVID-19 diagnosis because of its low sensitivity.","Ikeda, Mayu; Imai, Kazuo; Tabata, Sakiko; Miyoshi, Kazuyasu; Mizuno, Tsukasa; Murahara, Nami; Horiuchi, Midori; Kato, Kento; Imoto, Yoshitaka; Iwata, Maki; Mimura, Satoshi; Ito, Toshimitsu; Tamura, Kaku; Kato, Yasuyuki",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.06.20124123v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.06.20124123,438
678470,Deep learning with robustness to missing data: A novel approach to the detection of COVID-19,2021-07-30,"The occurrence of idiopathic pulmonary lesions in laboratory rats, characterized by lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia with dense perivascular lymphoid cuffs, has been reported over the past decade. Although the term rat respiratory virus (RRV) was adopted to confer a putative viral etiology to the idiopathic pulmonary lesions, the etiology of this disease remains to be elucidated. Recently, inflammatory lesions have been observed in the lungs of immunocompetent laboratory rats similar to those previously described. Based on the latest evidence indicating that Pneumocystis carinii (P. carinii), and not putative RRV, causes infectious interstitial pneumonia in laboratory rats, the present study investigated whether the pulmonary lesions observed were caused by P. carinii infection. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, free of known pathogens, were introduced into a rat colony positive for RRV-type lesions. Routine histopathological examinations were performed on the rat lung tissues following exposure. The presence of Pneumocystis organisms was confirmed using Grocott’s methenamine silver (GMS) staining. At week 3 following introduction, a few small lymphoid aggregates were located adjacent to the edematous vascular sheath. By week 5, foci of dense perivascular lymphoid cuffing were observed. Multifocal lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia and prominent lymphoid perivascular cuffs were observed between week 7 and 10. GMS staining confirmed the presence of Pneumocystis cysts. Thus, the results of the present study demonstrated that P. carinii caused lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia in a group of laboratory rats. The observations strongly support the conclusion that P. carinii infection in immunocompetent laboratory rats causes the lung lesions that were previously attributed to RRV.","KIM, HYUN-SOO; DO, SUNG-IM; KIM, YOUN WHA",Exp Ther Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25009598/,438

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, kidney transplant recipients are stratified as being high risk of developing fatal illness from COVID-19 infection. Kidney transplant is the gold-standard treatment for end-stage kidney disease subjects. During the pandemic, significant concerns have emerged regarding continuation of kidney transplant surgeries and management of kidney transplant recipients post-transplant. The added risk of immunosuppression in this cohort was and remains a theoretical concern, posing a potential risk of transplantation rather than benefit. This comprehensive review aims to cover most of the faced challenges in kidney transplantation in different stages of the pandemic. In addition, it will elucidate the epidemiology, nature, course of the disease, surgical consideration in donors and recipients as well as role of immunosuppression and management of COVID-19 infected kidney transplant recipients during these extraordinary circumstances.","Nassar, Mahmoud; Nso, Nso; Ariyaratnam, Jonathan; Sandhu, Jasmine; Mohamed, Mahmoud; Baraka, Bahaaeldin; Ibrahim, Atif; Alfishawy, Mostafa; Zheng, David; Bhangoo, Harangad; Soliman, Karim M; Li, Matthew; Rizzo, Vincent; Daoud, Ahmed",World J Clin Cases,https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v9.i27.7986; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34621855/,438

Few studies have examined the relationship between unmet social needs and diabetes control among predominantly Black and Hispanic patient populations. METHODS: In a large urban hospital system in the Bronx, NY, 5846 unique patients with diabetes seen at a primary care visit between April 2018 and December 2019 completed a social needs screener. Measures included diabetes control (categorized as Hemoglobin (Hb) A1c <9.0 as controlled and Hb A1C ≥9.0 as uncontrolled), social needs (10-item screen), and demographic covariates, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status, percentage of block-group poverty, patient’s preferred language, and the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index. RESULTS: Twenty-two percent (22%) of the patient sample had at least 1 unmet social need, and the most prevalent unmet social needs were housing issues (including housing quality and insecurity), food insecurity, and lack of healthcare transportation. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant relationship between social needs and uncontrolled diabetes, with more social needs indicating a greater likelihood of uncontrolled diabetes (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) for ≥3 needs: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.26, 2.00). Of the patients with most frequently occurring unmet social needs, lack of healthcare transportation (AOR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.22, 1.95) and food insecurity (AOR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.89) had the greatest likelihood of having uncontrolled diabetes, after adjusting for covariates. CONCLUSION: Unmet social needs appear to be linked to a greater likelihood of uncontrolled diabetes.

680762,Introduction.,2021-08-23,"Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic debilitating condition characterized by progressive deposition of connective tissue, leading to a steady restriction of lung elasticity, a decline in lung function, and a median survival of 4.5 years. The leading causes of pulmonary fibrosis are inhalation of foreign particles (such as silicosis and pneumoconiosis), infections (such as post COVID-19), autoimmune diseases (such as systemic autoimmune diseases of the connective tissue), and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The therapeutics currently available for pulmonary fibrosis only modestly slow the progression of the disease. This review is centered on the interplay of damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-17) as they contribute to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, and the possible avenues to develop effective therapeutics that disrupt this interplay.","Bolourani, Siavash; Brenner, Max; Wang, Ping",J Mol Med (Berl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34258628/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00109-021-02113-y,438

It remains unclear whether the history of cerebrovascular disease is associated with in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, multicenter cohort study at Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. Using our institutional data warehouse, we identified all adult patients who were admitted to the hospital between March 1, 2020 and May 1, 2020 and had a positive nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in the emergency department. Using our institutional electronic health record, we extracted clinical characteristics of the cohort, including age, sex, and comorbidities. Using multivariable logistic regression to control for medical comorbidities, we modeled the relationship between history of stroke and all-cause, in-hospital death. RESULTS: We identified 3248 patients, of whom 387 (11.9%) had a history of stroke. Compared with patients without history of stroke, patients with a history of stroke were significantly older, and were significantly more likely to have a history of all medical comorbidities except for obesity, which was more prevalent in patients without a history of stroke. Compared with patients without history of stroke, patients with a history of stroke had higher in-hospital death rates during the study period (48.6% versus 31.7%, P<0.001). In the multivariable analysis, history of stroke (adjusted odds ratio, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.01–1.63]) was significantly associated with in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS: We found that history of stroke was associated with in-hospital death among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Further studies should confirm these results.","Kummer, Benjamin R.; Klang, Eyal; Stein, Laura K.; Dhamoon, Mandip S.; Jetté, Nathalie",Stroke,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32772679/; https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.120.030685,438

Therefore, it is essential to develop strategies to deal with these challenges. One of them is to aggregate smaller packets into a larger payload packet, and these groups of aggregated packets will share the same header, hence increasing throughput, improved resource utilisation, and reduction in energy consumption. This paper presents a review of packet aggregation applications in access networks (e.g., IoT and 4G/5G mobile networks), optical core networks, and cloud computing data centre networks. Then we propose new analytical models based on diffusion approximation for the evaluation of the performance of packet aggregation mechanisms. We demonstrate the use of measured traffic from real networks to evaluate the performance of packet aggregation mechanisms analytically. The use of diffusion approximation allows us to consider time-dependent queueing models with general interarrival and service time distributions. Therefore these models are more general than others presented till now.","Kuaban, Godlove Suila; Atmaca, Tülin; Kamli, Amira; Czachórski, Tadeusz; Czekalski, Piotr",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21113898; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34200090/,438

686302,False equivalence or fake news: is a peanut really an egg?,2021,"Although there is a robust body of literature exploring the relationship between biophilic urban planning (BUP) and public health and well-being, there is a dearth of scholarship on the emotional components of BUP. It is crucial to understand these sentiment-related elements, so planners can assign “human value” to green spaces as a strategy for emphasizing the need to thoughtfully implement and properly maintain them in urban environments. Furthermore, humans’ emotional experiences with green spaces may also reveal hidden or unexpected functions of those spaces. To confirm this lack of emphasis on emotions in BUP, we used Scopus to conduct a bibliometric analysis on relevant literature published within the last twenty years (2001–2021), ultimately collecting 589 relevant peer-reviewed articles. We then utilized VOSviewer (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, The Netherlands) to visualize our results and identify thematic, geographic, authorship/co-authorship, publication, and temporal trends. “Green space” appeared as our most frequently occurring keyword and scholars affiliated with institutions located within the United States, the United Kingdom and China were the top producers of relevant results. Our authorship analysis resulted in 67 different clusters and three major but isolated networks. Urban Forestry and Urban Greening was the most prevalent source of publication and 2019–2021 was the most prolific period of activity to date. While the goal of our review is to underscore the dearth of controlled, interdisciplinary research on the emotional components of BUP, we also uncovered additional key gaps in scholarship that could promote future avenues of inquiry. First, by focusing on the emotional value of green spaces, practitioners can ascribe them an intangible “human value” that could, in turn, generate more community-focused designs that provide access across socioeconomic, racial and age brackets. Second, an increase in scholarly representation from developing countries could help address the “human value” of green spaces not simply as a “first-world” phenomenon. Finally, a global focus on the emotional, human connections to green spaces may help scholars and practitioners alike mitigate the growing trend of green gentrification.","Tirri, Christopher; Swanson, Hunter; Meenar, Mahbubur",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574359/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189435,438

METHODS: We searched for articles in PubMed and Google Scholar databases till 02 April 2020, with the following keywords: “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID-19”, “infection”, “pathogenesis”, “incubation period”, “transmission”, “clinical features”, “diagnosis”, “treatment”, “diabetes”, with interposition of the Boolean operator “AND”. RESULTS: The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is heterogeneous, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure and death. Older age, diabetes and other comorbidities are reported as significant predictors of morbidity and mortality. Chronic inflammation, increased coagulation activity, immune response impairment, and potential direct pancreatic damage by SARS-CoV-2 might be among the underlying mechanisms of the association between diabetes and COVID-19. No conclusive evidence exists to support the discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers because of COVID-19 in people with diabetes. Caution should be taken to potential hypoglycemic events with the use of chloroquine in these subjects. Patient tailored therapeutic strategies, rigorous glucose monitoring and careful consideration of drug interactions might reduce adverse outcomes.
