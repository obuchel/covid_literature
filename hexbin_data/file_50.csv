65,65,65,Delivery Systems for the Direct Application of siRNAs to Induce RNA Interference (RNAi) In Vivo,11.203737,6.9639654,2006-05-18,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful method for specific gene silencing which may also lead to promising novel therapeutic strategies. It is mediated through small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) which sequence-specifically trigger the cleavage and subsequent degradation of their target mRNA. One critical factor is the ability to deliver intact siRNAs into target cells/organs in vivo. This review highlights the mechanism of RNAi and the guidelines for the design of optimal siRNAs. It gives an overview of studies based on the systemic or local application of naked siRNAs or the use of various nonviral siRNA delivery systems. One promising avenue is the the complexation of siRNAs with the polyethylenimine (PEI), which efficiently stabilizes siRNAs and, upon systemic administration, leads to the delivery of the intact siRNAs into different organs. The antitumorigenic effects of PEI/siRNA-mediated in vivo gene-targeting of tumor-relevant proteins like in mouse tumor xenograft models are described.","Aigner, Achim",J Biomed Biotechnol,50,1
103,103,103,Rapid Identification of Malaria Vaccine Candidates Based on α-Helical Coiled Coil Protein Motif,11.53158,7.0905046,2007-07-25,"To identify malaria antigens for vaccine development, we selected α-helical coiled coil domains of proteins predicted to be present in the parasite erythrocytic stage. The corresponding synthetic peptides are expected to mimic structurally “native” epitopes. Indeed the 95 chemically synthesized peptides were all specifically recognized by human immune sera, though at various prevalence. Peptide specific antibodies were obtained both by affinity-purification from malaria immune sera and by immunization of mice. These antibodies did not show significant cross reactions, i.e., they were specific for the original peptide, reacted with native parasite proteins in infected erythrocytes and several were active in inhibiting in vitro parasite growth. Circular dichroism studies indicated that the selected peptides assumed partial or high α-helical content. Thus, we demonstrate that the bioinformatics/chemical synthesis approach described here can lead to the rapid identification of molecules which target biologically active antibodies, thus identifying suitable vaccine candidates. This strategy can be, in principle, extended to vaccine discovery in a wide range of other pathogens.","Villard, Viviane; Agak, George W.; Frank, Géraldine; Jafarshad, Ali; Servis, Catherine; Nébié, Issa; Sirima, Sodiomon B.; Felger, Ingrid; Arevalo-Herrera, Myriam; Herrera, Socrates; Heitz, Frederic; Bäcker, Volker; Druilhe, Pierre; Kajava, Andrey V.; Corradin, Giampietro",PLoS One,50,1
122,122,122,Species-specific evolution of immune receptor tyrosine based activation motif-containing CEACAM1-related immune receptors in the dog,11.461342,7.0092936,2007-10-18,"BACKGROUND: Although the impact of pathogens on the evolution of the mammalian immune system is still under debate, proteins, which both regulate immune responses and serve as cellular receptors for pathogens should be at the forefront of pathogen-driven host evolution. The CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) gene family codes for such proteins and indeed shows tremendous species-specific variation between human and rodents. Since little is known about the CEA gene family in other lineages of placental mammals, we expected to gain new insights into the evolution of the rapidly diverging CEA family by analyzing the CEA family of the dog. RESULTS: Here we describe the complete CEA gene family in the dog. We found that the gene coding for the ITIM-bearing immunoregulatory molecule CEACAM1 gave rise to a recent expansion of the canine CEA gene family by gene duplication, similar to that previously found in humans and mice. However, while the murine and human CEACAMs (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules) are predominantly secreted and GPI-anchored, respectively, in the dog, most of the CEACAMs represent ITAM-bearing transmembrane proteins. One of these proteins, CEACAM28, exhibits nearly complete sequence identity with the ligand-binding N domain of CEACAM1, but antagonizing signaling motifs in the cytoplasmic tail. Comparison of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions indicates that the CEACAM28 N domain is under the strongest purifying selection of all canine CEACAM1-related CEACAMs. In addition, CEACAM28 shows a similar expression pattern in resting immune cells and tissues as CEACAM1. However, upon activation CEACAM28 mRNA and CEACAM1 mRNA are differentially regulated. CONCLUSION: Thus, CEACAM1 and CEACAM28 are the first paired immune receptors identified within the CEA gene family, which are expressed on T cells and are most likely involved in the fine-tuning of T cell responses. The direction of gene conversion accompanied by purifying selection and expression in immune cells suggests the possibility that CEACAM28 evolved in response to selective pressure imposed by species-specific pathogens.","Kammerer, Robert; Popp, Tanja; Härtle, Stefan; Singer, Bernhard B; Zimmermann, Wolfgang",BMC Evol Biol,50,1
275,275,275,Regulated Ire1-dependent decay of messenger RNAs in mammalian cells,11.487985,7.042769,2009-08-10,"Maintenance of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function is achieved in part through Ire1 (inositol-requiring enzyme 1), a transmembrane protein activated by protein misfolding in the ER. The cytoplasmic nuclease domain of Ire1 cleaves the messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding XBP-1 (X-box–binding protein 1), enabling splicing and production of this active transcription factor. We recently showed that Ire1 activation independently induces the rapid turnover of mRNAs encoding membrane and secreted proteins in Drosophila melanogaster cells through a pathway we call regulated Ire1-dependent decay (RIDD). In this study, we show that mouse fibroblasts expressing wild-type Ire1 but not an Ire1 variant lacking nuclease activity also degrade mRNAs in response to ER stress. Using a second variant of Ire1 that is activated by a small adenosine triphosphate analogue, we show that although XBP-1 splicing can be artificially induced in the absence of ER stress, RIDD appears to require both Ire1 activity and ER stress. Our data suggest that cells use a multitiered mechanism by which different conditions in the ER lead to distinct outputs from Ire1.","Hollien, Julie; Lin, Jonathan H.; Li, Han; Stevens, Nicole; Walter, Peter; Weissman, Jonathan S.",J Cell Biol,50,8
326,326,326,Listeriolysin O Is Necessary and Sufficient to Induce Autophagy during Listeria monocytogenes Infection,11.326919,7.1924314,2010-01-06,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that autophagy is utilized by cells as a protective mechanism against Listeria monocytogenes infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: However we find autophagy has no measurable role in vacuolar escape and intracellular growth in primary cultured bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) deficient for autophagy (atg5(−/−)). Nevertheless, we provide evidence that the pore forming activity of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin listeriolysin O (LLO) can induce autophagy subsequent to infection by L. monocytogenes. Infection of BMDMs with L. monocytogenes induced microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) lipidation, consistent with autophagy activation, whereas a mutant lacking LLO did not. Infection of BMDMs that express LC3-GFP demonstrated that wild-type L. monocytogenes was encapsulated by LC3-GFP, consistent with autophagy activation, whereas a mutant lacking LLO was not. Bacillus subtilis expressing either LLO or a related cytolysin, perfringolysin O (PFO), induced LC3 colocalization and LC3 lipidation. Further, LLO-containing liposomes also recruited LC3-GFP, indicating that LLO was sufficient to induce targeted autophagy in the absence of infection. The role of autophagy had variable effects depending on the cell type assayed. In atg5(−/−) mouse embryonic fibroblasts, L. monocytogenes had a primary vacuole escape defect. However, the bacteria escaped and grew normally in atg5(−/−) BMDMs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We propose that membrane damage, such as that caused by LLO, triggers bacterial-targeted autophagy, although autophagy does not affect the fate of wild-type intracellular L. monocytogenes in primary BMDMs.","Meyer-Morse, Nicole; Robbins, Jennifer R.; Rae, Chris S.; Mochegova, Sofia N.; Swanson, Michele S.; Zhao, Zijiang; Virgin, Herbert W.; Portnoy, Daniel",PLoS One,50,1
379,379,379,The Effect of Vaccination on the Evolution and Population Dynamics of Avian Paramyxovirus-1,11.127826,6.8650827,2010-04-22,"Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) is a pathogenic strain of avian paramyxovirus (aPMV-1) that is among the most serious of disease threats to the poultry industry worldwide. Viral diversity is high in aPMV-1; eight genotypes are recognized based on phylogenetic reconstruction of gene sequences. Modified live vaccines have been developed to decrease the economic losses caused by this virus. Vaccines derived from avirulent genotype II strains were developed in the 1950s and are in use globally, whereas Australian strains belonging to genotype I were developed as vaccines in the 1970s and are used mainly in Asia. In this study, we evaluated the consequences of attenuated live virus vaccination on the evolution of aPMV-1 genotypes. There was phylogenetic incongruence among trees based on individual genes and complete coding region of 54 full length aPMV-1 genomes, suggesting that recombinant sequences were present in the data set. Subsequently, five recombinant genomes were identified, four of which contained sequences from either genotype I or II. The population history of vaccine-related genotype II strains was distinct from other aPMV-1 genotypes; genotype II emerged in the late 19(th) century and is evolving more slowly than other genotypes, which emerged in the 1960s. Despite vaccination efforts, genotype II viruses have experienced constant population growth to the present. In contrast, other contemporary genotypes showed population declines in the late 1990s. Additionally, genotype I and II viruses, which are circulating in the presence of homotypic vaccine pressure, have unique selection profiles compared to nonvaccine-related strains. Collectively, these data show that vaccination with live attenuated viruses has changed the evolution of aPMV-1 by maintaining a large effective population size of a vaccine-related genotype, allowing for coinfection and recombination of vaccine and wild type strains, and by applying unique selective pressures on viral glycoproteins.","Chong, Yee Ling; Padhi, Abinash; Hudson, Peter J.; Poss, Mary",PLoS Pathog,50,1
480,480,480,Conserved epitopes of influenza A virus inducing protective immunity and their prospects for universal vaccine development,11.413135,6.9879923,2010-11-30,"Influenza A viruses belong to the best studied viruses, however no effective prevention against influenza infection has been developed. The emerging of still new escape variants of influenza A viruses causing epidemics and periodic worldwide pandemics represents a threat for human population. Therefore, current, hot task of influenza virus research is to look for a way how to get us closer to a universal vaccine. Combination of chosen conserved antigens inducing cross-protective antibody response with epitopes activating also cross-protective cytotoxic T-cells would offer an attractive strategy for improving protection against drift variants of seasonal influenza viruses and reduces the impact of future pandemic strains. Antigenically conserved fusion-active subunit of hemagglutinin (HA2 gp) and ectodomain of matrix protein 2 (eM2) are promising candidates for preparation of broadly protective HA2- or eM2-based vaccine that may aid in pandemic preparedness. Overall protective effect could be achieved by contribution of epitopes recognized by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) that have been studied extensively to reach much broader control of influenza infection. In this review we present the state-of-art in this field. We describe known adaptive immune mechanisms mediated by influenza specific B- and T-cells involved in the anti-influenza immune defense together with the contribution of innate immunity. We discuss the mechanisms of neutralization of influenza infection mediated by antibodies, the role of CTL in viral elimination and new approaches to develop epitope based vaccine inducing cross-protective influenza virus-specific immune response.","Staneková, Zuzana; Varečková, Eva",Virol J,50,28
481,481,481,The intracellular dynamic of protein palmitoylation,11.400454,6.927643,2010-12-27,"S-palmitoylation describes the reversible attachment of fatty acids (predominantly palmitate) onto cysteine residues via a labile thioester bond. This posttranslational modification impacts protein functionality by regulating membrane interactions, intracellular sorting, stability, and membrane micropatterning. Several recent findings have provided a tantalizing insight into the regulation and spatiotemporal dynamics of protein palmitoylation. In mammalian cells, the Golgi has emerged as a possible super-reaction center for the palmitoylation of peripheral membrane proteins, whereas palmitoylation reactions on post-Golgi compartments contribute to the regulation of specific substrates. In addition to palmitoylating and depalmitoylating enzymes, intracellular palmitoylation dynamics may also be controlled through interplay with distinct posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation and nitrosylation.","Salaun, Christine; Greaves, Jennifer; Chamberlain, Luke H.",J Cell Biol,50,8
550,550,550,The Multifaceted Poliovirus 2A Protease: Regulation of Gene Expression by Picornavirus Proteases,11.414458,6.9823103,2011-04-14,"After entry into animal cells, most viruses hijack essential components involved in gene expression. This is the case of poliovirus, which abrogates cellular translation soon after virus internalization. Abrogation is achieved by cleavage of both eIF4GI and eIF4GII by the viral protease 2A. Apart from the interference of poliovirus with cellular protein synthesis, other gene expression steps such as RNA and protein trafficking between nucleus and cytoplasm are also altered. Poliovirus 2A(pro) is capable of hydrolyzing components of the nuclear pore, thus preventing an efficient antiviral response by the host cell. Here, we compare in detail poliovirus 2A(pro) with other viral proteins (from picornaviruses and unrelated families) as regard to their activity on key host factors that control gene expression. It is possible that future analyses to determine the cellular proteins targeted by 2A(pro) will uncover other cellular functions ablated by poliovirus infection. Further understanding of the cellular proteins hydrolyzed by 2A(pro) will add further insight into the molecular mechanism by which poliovirus and other viruses interact with the host cell.","Castelló, Alfredo; Álvarez, Enrique; Carrasco, Luis",J Biomed Biotechnol,50,1
1038,1038,1038,"Pandemic influenza A virus codon usage revisited: biases, adaptation and implications for vaccine strain development",11.548505,7.054837,2012-11-08,"BACKGROUND: Influenza A virus (IAV) is a member of the family Orthomyxoviridae and contains eight segments of a single-stranded RNA genome with negative polarity. The first influenza pandemic of this century was declared in April of 2009, with the emergence of a novel H1N1 IAV strain (H1N1pdm) in Mexico and USA. Understanding the extent and causes of biases in codon usage is essential to the understanding of viral evolution. A comprehensive study to investigate the effect of selection pressure imposed by the human host on the codon usage of an emerging, pandemic IAV strain and the trends in viral codon usage involved over the pandemic time period is much needed. RESULTS: We performed a comprehensive codon usage analysis of 310 IAV strains from the pandemic of 2009. Highly biased codon usage for Ala, Arg, Pro, Thr and Ser were found. Codon usage is strongly influenced by underlying biases in base composition. When correspondence analysis (COA) on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) is applied, the distribution of IAV ORFs in the plane defined by the first two major dimensional factors showed that different strains are located at different places, suggesting that IAV codon usage also reflects an evolutionary process. CONCLUSIONS: A general association between codon usage bias, base composition and poor adaptation of the virus to the respective host tRNA pool, suggests that mutational pressure is the main force shaping H1N1 pdm IAV codon usage. A dynamic process is observed in the variation of codon usage of the strains enrolled in these studies. These results suggest a balance of mutational bias and natural selection, which allow the virus to explore and re-adapt its codon usage to different environments. Recoding of IAV taking into account codon bias, base composition and adaptation to host tRNA may provide important clues to develop new and appropriate vaccines.","Goñi, Natalia; Iriarte, Andrés; Comas, Victoria; Soñora, Martín; Moreno, Pilar; Moratorio, Gonzalo; Musto, Héctor; Cristina, Juan",Virol J,50,28
1044,1044,1044,The Immunosuppressive Agent Mizoribine Monophosphate Is an Inhibitor of the Human RNA Capping Enzyme,11.353598,7.1846237,2013-01-17,"Mizoribine monophosphate (MZP) is a specific inhibitor of the cellular inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), the enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step of de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis. MZP is a highly potent antagonistic inhibitor of IMPDH that blocks the proliferation of T and B lymphocytes that use the de novo pathway of guanine nucleotide synthesis almost exclusively. In the present study, we investigated the ability of MZP to directly inhibit the human RNA capping enzyme (HCE), a protein harboring both RNA 5′-triphosphatase and RNA guanylyltransferase activities. HCE is involved in the synthesis of the cap structure found at the 5′ end of eukaryotic mRNAs, which is critical for the splicing of the cap-proximal intron, the transport of mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and for both the stability and translation of mRNAs. Our biochemical studies provide the first insight that MZP can inhibit the formation of the RNA cap structure catalyzed by HCE. In the presence of MZP, the RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity appears to be relatively unaffected while the RNA guanylyltransferase activity is inhibited, indicating that the RNA guanylyltransferase activity is the main target of MZP inhibition. Kinetic studies reveal that MZP is a non-competitive inhibitor that likely targets an allosteric site on HCE. Mizoribine also impairs mRNA capping in living cells, which could account for the global mechanism of action of this therapeutic agent. Together, our study clearly demonstrates that mizoribine monophosphate inhibits the human RNA guanylyltransferase in vitro and impair mRNA capping in cellulo.","Picard-Jean, Frédéric; Bougie, Isabelle; Shuto, Satoshi; Bisaillon, Martin",PLoS One,50,11

Yet narrow windows of disease symptoms and confounding environmental factors have made it difficult to identify polymorphic genes that contribute to differential disease outcomes in human populations. Therefore, to control for these confounding environmental variables in a system that models the levels of genetic diversity found in outbred populations such as humans, we used incipient lines of the highly genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) recombinant inbred (RI) panel (the pre-CC population) to study how genetic variation impacts influenza associated disease across a genetically diverse population. A wide range of variation in influenza disease related phenotypes including virus replication, virus-induced inflammation, and weight loss was observed. Many of the disease associated phenotypes were correlated, with viral replication and virus-induced inflammation being predictors of virus-induced weight loss. Despite these correlations, pre-CC mice with unique and novel disease phenotype combinations were observed. We also identified sets of transcripts (modules) that were correlated with aspects of disease. In order to identify how host genetic polymorphisms contribute to the observed variation in disease, we conducted quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. We identified several QTL contributing to specific aspects of the host response including virus-induced weight loss, titer, pulmonary edema, neutrophil recruitment to the airways, and transcriptional expression. Existing whole-genome sequence data was applied to identify high priority candidate genes within QTL regions. A key host response QTL was located at the site of the known anti-influenza Mx1 gene. We sequenced the coding regions of Mx1 in the eight CC founder strains, and identified a novel Mx1 allele that showed reduced ability to inhibit viral replication, while maintaining protection from weight loss.","Ferris, Martin T.; Aylor, David L.; Bottomly, Daniel; Whitmore, Alan C.; Aicher, Lauri D.; Bell, Timothy A.; Bradel-Tretheway, Birgit; Bryan, Janine T.; Buus, Ryan J.; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Haagmans, Bart L.; McMillan, Leonard; Miller, Darla R.; Rosenzweig, Elizabeth; Valdar, William; Wang, Jeremy; Churchill, Gary A.; Threadgill, David W.; McWeeney, Shannon K.; Katze, Michael G.; Pardo-Manuel de Villena, Fernando; Baric, Ralph S.; Heise, Mark T.",PLoS Pathog,50,1

They are generated through fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane and release of interluminal vesicles. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that macrophages infected with Mycobacterium release exosomes that promote activation of both innate and acquired immune responses; however, the components present on exosomes inducing these host responses were not defined. The present study used LC-MS/MS to identify 41 mycobacterial proteins present on exosomes released from M. tuberculosis-infected J774 cells. Many of these proteins have been characterized as highly immunogenic. Further, since most of the mycobacterial proteins identified are actively secreted, we hypothesized that macrophages treated with M. tuberculosis culture filtrate proteins (CFP) would release exosomes containing mycobacterial proteins. We found 29 M. tuberculosis proteins in exosomes released from CFP-treated J774 cells, the majority of which were also present on exosomes isolated from M. tuberculosis-infected cells. The exosomes from CFP-treated J774 cells could promote macrophage and dendritic cell activation as well as activation of naïve T cells in vivo.

Here, we report for the first time, a method in Glyco-engineered Pichia pastoris that enables simultaneous surface display and secretion of full-length mAb molecules with human-like N-glycans using the same yeast cell. This paradigm takes advantage of homo-dimerization of the Fc portion of an IgG molecule to a surface-anchored ""bait"" Fc, which results in targeting functional “half” IgGs to the cell wall of Pichia pastoris without interfering with the secretion of full length mAb. We show the utility of this method in isolating high affinity, well-expressed anti-PCSK9 leads from a designed library that was created by mating yeasts containing either light chain or heavy chain IgG libraries. Coupled with Glyco-engineered Pichia pastoris , this method provides a powerful tool for the discovery and production of therapeutic human mAbs in the same host thus improving drug developability and potentially shortening the discovery time cycle.","Shaheen, Hussam H.; Prinz, Bianka; Chen, Ming-Tang; Pavoor, Tej; Lin, Song; Houston-Cummings, Nga Rewa; Moore, Renee; Stadheim, Terrance A.; Zha, Dongxing",PLoS One,50,1

Different single-nucleotide polymorphisms associate with invasive serous (rs7405776 odds ratio (OR)=1.13, P=3.1 × 10(−10)) and clear cell (rs11651755 OR=0.77, P=1.6 × 10(−8)) epithelial ovarian cancer.

1388,1388,1388,Evolution and Structural Organization of the C Proteins of Paramyxovirinae,11.503315,7.106778,2014-02-25,"The phosphoprotein (P) gene of most Paramyxovirinae encodes several proteins in overlapping frames: P and V, which share a common N-terminus (PNT), and C, which overlaps PNT. Overlapping genes are of particular interest because they encode proteins originated de novo, some of which have unknown structural folds, challenging the notion that nature utilizes only a limited, well-mapped area of fold space. The C proteins cluster in three groups, comprising measles, Nipah, and Sendai virus. We predicted that all C proteins have a similar organization: a variable, disordered N-terminus and a conserved, α-helical C-terminus. We confirmed this predicted organization by biophysically characterizing recombinant C proteins from Tupaia paramyxovirus (measles group) and human parainfluenza virus 1 (Sendai group). We also found that the C of the measles and Nipah groups have statistically significant sequence similarity, indicating a common origin. Although the C of the Sendai group lack sequence similarity with them, we speculate that they also have a common origin, given their similar genomic location and structural organization. Since C is dispensable for viral replication, unlike PNT, we hypothesize that C may have originated de novo by overprinting PNT in the ancestor of Paramyxovirinae. Intriguingly, in measles virus and Nipah virus, PNT encodes STAT1-binding sites that overlap different regions of the C-terminus of C, indicating they have probably originated independently. This arrangement, in which the same genetic region encodes simultaneously a crucial functional motif (a STAT1-binding site) and a highly constrained region (the C-terminus of C), seems paradoxical, since it should severely reduce the ability of the virus to adapt. The fact that it originated twice suggests that it must be balanced by an evolutionary advantage, perhaps from reducing the size of the genetic region vulnerable to mutations.","Lo, Michael K.; Søgaard, Teit Max; Karlin, David G.",PLoS One,50,1

1435,1435,1435,Counteraction of the multifunctional restriction factor tetherin,11.329645,6.936811,2014-04-10,"The interferon-inducible restriction factor tetherin (also known as CD317, BST-2 or HM1.24) has emerged as a key component of the antiviral immune response. Initially, tetherin was shown to restrict replication of various enveloped viruses by inhibiting the release of budding virions from infected cells. More recently, it has become clear that tetherin also acts as a pattern recognition receptor inducing NF-κB-dependent proinflammatory gene expression in virus infected cells. Whereas the ability to restrict virion release is highly conserved among mammalian tetherin orthologs and thus probably an ancient function of this protein, innate sensing seems to be an evolutionarily recent activity. The potent and broad antiviral activity of tetherin is reflected by the fact that many viruses evolved means to counteract this restriction factor. A continuous arms race with viruses has apparently driven the evolution of different isoforms of tetherin with different functional properties. Interestingly, tetherin has also been implicated in cellular processes that are unrelated to immunity, such as the organization of the apical actin network and membrane microdomains or stabilization of the Golgi apparatus. In this review, I summarize our current knowledge of the different functions of tetherin and describe the molecular strategies that viruses have evolved to antagonize or evade this multifunctional host restriction factor.","Sauter, Daniel",Front Microbiol,50,1

By using bioinformatics algorithms, a total of 50 antigens with α-helical coiled coil motifs orthologous to Plasmodium falciparum were identified in the P. vivax genome. The peptides identified in silico were chemically synthesized; circular dichroism studies indicated partial or high α-helical content. Antigenicity was evaluated using human sera samples from malaria-endemic areas of Colombia and Papua New Guinea. Eight of these fragments were selected and used to assess immunogenicity in BALB/c mice. ELISA assays indicated strong reactivity of serum samples from individuals residing in malaria-endemic regions and sera of immunized mice, with the α-helical coiled coil structures. In addition, ex vivo production of IFN-γ by murine mononuclear cells confirmed the immunogenicity of these structures and the presence of T-cell epitopes in the peptide sequences. Moreover, sera of mice immunized with four of the eight antigens recognized native proteins on blood-stage P. vivax parasites, and antigenic cross-reactivity with three of the peptides was observed when reacted with both the P. falciparum orthologous fragments and whole parasites. Results here point to the α-helical coiled coil peptides as possible P. vivax malaria vaccine candidates as were observed for P. falciparum.

In this study, a high-throughput cell-based screening on the serine/threonine kinase siRNA library was performed to identify potential antiviral agents against EV71 replication. Among the hits, Misshapen/NIKs-related kinase (MINK) was selected for detailed analysis due to its strong inhibitory profile and novelty. In the investigation of the stage at which MINK is involved in EV71 replication, virus RNA transfection in MINK siRNA-treated cells continued to cause virus inhibition despite bypassing the normal entry pathway, suggesting its involvement at the post-entry stage. We have also shown that viral RNA and protein expression level was significantly reduced upon MINK silencing, suggesting its involvement in viral protein synthesis which feeds into viral RNA replication process. Through proteomic analysis and infection inhibition assay, we found that the activation of MINK was triggered by early replication events, instead of the binding and entry of the virus. Proteomic analysis on the activation profile of p38 Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) indicated that the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was stimulated by EV71 infection upon MINK activation. Luciferase reporter assay further revealed that the translation efficiency of the EV71 internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) was reduced after blocking the MINK/p38 MAPK pathway. Further investigation on the effect of MINK silencing on heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) localisation demonstrated that cytoplasmic relocalisation of hnRNP A1 upon EV71 infection may be facilitated via the MINK/p38 MAPK pathway which then positively regulates the translation of viral RNA transcripts. These novel findings hence suggest that MINK plays a functional role in the IRES-mediated translation of EV71 viral RNA and may provide a potential target for the development of specific antiviral strategies against EV71 infection.","Leong, Shi Yun; Ong, Bryan Kit Teck; Chu, Justin Jang Hann",PLoS Pathog,50,11
1953,1953,1953,Mosquito Rasputin interacts with chikungunya virus nsP3 and determines the infection rate in Aedes albopictus,11.467388,7.085512,2015-09-17,"BACKGROUND: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthritogenic alphavirus (family Togaviridae), transmitted by Aedes species mosquitoes. CHIKV re-emerged in 2004 with multiple outbreaks worldwide and recently reached the Americas where it has infected over a million individuals in a rapidly expanding epidemic. While alphavirus replication is well understood in general, the specific function (s) of non-structural protein nsP3 remain elusive. CHIKV nsP3 modulates the mammalian stress response by preventing stress granule formation through sequestration of G3BP. In mosquitoes, nsP3 is a determinant of vector specificity, but its functional interaction with mosquito proteins is unclear. METHODS: In this research we studied the domains required for localization of CHIKV nsP3 in insect cells and demonstrated its molecular interaction with Rasputin (Rin), the mosquito homologue of G3BP. The biological involvement of Rin in CHIKV infection was investigated in live Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. RESULTS: In insect cells, nsP3 localized as cytoplasmic granules, which was dependent on the central domain and the C-terminal variable region but independent of the N-terminal macrodomain. Ae. albopictus Rin displayed a diffuse, cytoplasmic localization, but was effectively sequestered into nsP3-granules upon nsP3 co-expression. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that the Rin-nsP3 interaction involved the NTF2-like domain of Rin and two conserved TFGD repeats in the C-terminal variable domain of nsP3. Although in vitro silencing of Rin did not impact nsP3 localization or CHIKV replication in cell culture, Rin depletion in vivo significantly decreased the CHIKV infection rate and transmissibility in Ae.albopictus. CONCLUSIONS: We identified the nsP3 hypervariable C-terminal domain as a critical factor for granular localization and sequestration of mosquito Rin. Our study offers novel insight into a conserved virus-mosquito interaction at the molecular level, and reveals a strong proviral role for G3BP homologue Rin in live mosquitoes, making the nsP3-Rin interaction a putative target to interfere with the CHIKV transmission cycle.","Fros, Jelke J.; Geertsema, Corinne; Zouache, Karima; Baggen, Jim; Domeradzka, Natalia; van Leeuwen, Daniël M.; Flipse, Jacky; Vlak, Just M.; Failloux, Anna-Bella; Pijlman, Gorben P.",Parasit Vectors,50,28

OBJECTIVES: The current study aims to establish the use of rolling circle amplification (RCA) based on internal transcribed spacer ribosomal DNA (ITS rDNA) as a powerful, simple, and rapid procedure for distinguishing closely related organisms, and specifically to identify Trichophyton species, which cause human and animal disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of sixty-one isolates belonging to three species of Trichophyton were identified to the species level based on microscopic and macroscopic examinations and their ITS rDNA regions were sequenced. Three specific circular oligonucleotide probes targeting the ITS1 and ITS2 regions were designed to differentiate Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, and T. tonsurans. RESULTS: Of the 61 putative Trichophyton clinical isolates, 52 were identified to the species level. The most common species was T. mentagrophytes var. interdigitale (31 isolates), followed by T. rubrum (11 isolates), T. tonsurans (9 isolates), and T. violaceum (1 isolates); moreover, 9 isolates were identified as non-Trichophyton species. The RCA method correctly identified four Trichophyton species and was 100% specific for each species. Neither cross-reaction between the examined species of Trichophyton nor false positive or false negative results were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Species identification of Trichophyton is crucially important for epidemiological and phylogenetic purposes and for genotype delineation. RCA based on ITS polymorphisms can be used to generate identification barcodes and as an alternative to DNA sequencing; it is a very fast, specific, and economical tool for species identification.","Zakeri, Hamideh; Shokohi, Tahereh; Badali, Hamid; Mayahi, Saba; Didehdar, Mojtaba",Jundishapur J Microbiol,50,11

Here, we report that Ring finger protein 166 (RNF166) potentiates RNA virus-triggered IFN-β production. Overexpression of RNF166 rather than its homologous proteins RNF114, RNF125, and RNF138, enhanced Sendai virus (SeV)-induced activation of the IFN-β promoter. Knockdown of endogenous RNF166, but not other RNFs, inhibited the IFN-β production induced by SeV and encephalomyocarditis virus. RNF166 interacted with TRAF3 and TRAF6. SeV-induced ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6 was suppressed when endogenous RNF166 rather than RNF114/138 was knocked down. These findings suggest that RNF166 positively regulates RNA virus-triggered IFN-β production by enhancing the ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6.","Chen, Hai-Wei; Yang, Yong-Kang; Xu, Hao; Yang, Wei-Wei; Zhai, Zhong-He; Chen, Dan-Ying",Sci Rep,50,28

In this study, the deadly agent of hemorrhagic diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome, Escherichia coli O157:H7 was investigated with extensive computational approaches aimed at identifying novel and broad-spectrum antibiotic targets. A systematic in silico workflow consisting of comparative genomics, metabolic pathways analysis, and additional drug prioritizing parameters was used to identify novel drug targets that were essential for the pathogen’s survival but absent in its human host. Comparative genomic analysis of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotated metabolic pathways identified 350 putative target proteins in E. coli O157:H7 which showed no similarity to human proteins. Further bio-informatic approaches including prediction of subcellular localization, calculation of molecular weight, and web-based investigation of 3D structural characteristics greatly aided in filtering the potential drug targets from 350 to 120. Ultimately, 44 non-homologous essential proteins of E. coli O157:H7 were prioritized and proved to have the eligibility to become novel broad-spectrum antibiotic targets and DNA polymerase III alpha (dnaE) was the top-ranked among these targets. Moreover, druggability of each of the identified drug targets was evaluated by the DrugBank database. In addition, 3D structure of the dnaE was modeled and explored further for in silico docking with ligands having potential druggability. Finally, we confirmed that the compounds N-coeleneterazine and N-(1,4-dihydro-5H-tetrazol-5-ylidene)-9-oxo-9H-xanthene-2-sulfon-amide were the most suitable ligands of dnaE and hence proposed as the potential inhibitors of this target protein.

Kosher scoring of lung adhesions was used to allocate 122 and 62 animals to High (Glatt Kosher) and Low (Non-Kosher) resistant groups, respectively. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip according to the Infinium protocol. Moving average of -logP was used to map QTLs and Log drop was used to define their boundaries (QTLRs). The combined procedure was efficient for high resolution mapping. Nineteen QTLRs distributed over 13 autosomes were found, some overlapping previous studies. The QTLRs contain polymorphic functional and expression candidate genes to affect kosher status, with putative immunological and wound healing activities. Kosher phenotyping was shown to be a reliable means to map QTLs affecting BRD morbidity.","Lipkin, Ehud; Strillacci, Maria Giuseppina; Eitam, Harel; Yishay, Moran; Schiavini, Fausta; Soller, Morris; Bagnato, Alessandro; Shabtay, Ariel",PLoS One,50,17

RdRp consists of three subunits (PA, PB1 and PB2) and binds both the highly conserved 3′- and 5′-ends of the vRNA segment. The IAV RdRp is an important antiviral target, but its structural mechanism has remained largely elusive to date. By applying a polyprotein strategy, we produced RdRp complexes and define a minimal human IAV RdRp core complex. We show that PA-PB1 forms a stable heterodimeric submodule that can strongly interact with 5′-vRNA. In contrast, 3′-vRNA recognition critically depends on the PB2 N-terminal domain. Moreover, we demonstrate that PA-PB1 forms a stable and stoichiometric complex with host nuclear import factor RanBP5 that can be modelled using SAXS and we show that the PA-PB1-RanPB5 complex is no longer capable of 5′-vRNA binding.

Chains can be formed via different linkages, which determines the type of signal they convey. Deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) regulate ubiquitylation status by trimming or removing chains from attached proteins. DUBs can contain several ubiquitin-binding pockets, which confer specificity toward differently linked chains. Most tools for monitoring DUB specificity target binding pockets on opposing sides of the active site; however, some DUBs contain additional pockets. Therefore, reagents targeting additional pockets are essential to fully understand linkage specificity. We report the development of active site-directed probes and fluorogenic substrates, based on non-hydrolyzable diubiquitin, that are equipped with a C-terminal warhead or a fluorogenic activity reporter moiety.

In this study, a 2.4-angstrom structure of the SS2 enolase is solved, revealing an octameric arrangement in the crystal. We further demonstrated that the enzyme exists exclusively as an octamer in solution via a sedimentation assay. These results indicate that the octamer is the biological unit of SS2 enolase at least in vitro and most likely in vivo as well. This is, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive characterization of the SS2 enolase octamer both structurally and biophysically, and the second octamer enolase structure in addition to that of Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Previous empirical studies on fitness landscapes were confined to either the neighborhood around the wild type sequence, involving mostly single and double mutants, or a combinatorially complete subgraph involving only two amino acids at each site. In reality, the dimensionality of protein sequence space is higher (20(L)) and there may be higher-order interactions among more than two sites. Here we experimentally characterized the fitness landscape of four sites in protein GB1, containing 20(4) = 160,000 variants. We found that while reciprocal sign epistasis blocked many direct paths of adaptation, such evolutionary traps could be circumvented by indirect paths through genotype space involving gain and subsequent loss of mutations. These indirect paths alleviate the constraint on adaptive protein evolution, suggesting that the heretofore neglected dimensions of sequence space may change our views on how proteins evolve.

Although the systematic identification of physical interactions between viral proteins and host proteins provides initial information for the recognition of the cellular mechanism involved in viral infection and the development of new therapies, EV71-host protein interactions have not been explored. Here, we identified interactions between EV71 proteins and host cellular proteins and confirmed the functional relationships of EV71-interacting proteins (EIPs) with virus proliferation and infection by integrating a human protein interaction network and by functional annotation. We found that most EIPs had known interactions with other viruses. We also predicted ATP6V0C as a broad-spectrum essential host factor and validated its essentiality for EV71 infection in vitro. EIPs and their interacting proteins were more likely to be targets of anti-inflammatory and neurological drugs, indicating their potential to serve as host-oriented antiviral targets. Thus, we used a connectivity map to find drugs that inhibited EIP expression. We predicted tanespimycin as a candidate and demonstrated its antiviral efficiency in vitro. These findings provide the first systematic identification of EV71-host protein interactions, an analysis of EIP protein characteristics and a demonstration of their value in developing host-oriented antiviral therapies.","Han, Lu; Li, Kang; Jin, Chaozhi; Wang, Jian; Li, Qingjun; Zhang, Qiling; Cheng, Qiyue; Yang, Jing; Bo, Xiaochen; Wang, Shengqi",Sci Rep,50,11

HA binds to a virus receptor, a sialoglycoprotein or sialoglycolipid, on the host cell and mediates virus attachment to the cell surface. The hydrolytic enzyme NA cleaves sialic acid from viral receptors and accelerates the release of progeny virus from host cells. In this study, we identified a novel function of HA and NA as machinery for viral motility. HAs exchanged binding partner receptors iteratively, generating virus movement on a receptor-coated glass surface instead of a cell surface. The virus movement was also dependent on NA. Virus movement mediated by HA and NA resulted in a three to four-fold increase in virus internalisation by cultured cells. We concluded that cooperation of HA and NA moves IAV particles on a cell surface and enhances virus infection of host cells.","Sakai, Tatsuya; Nishimura, Shin I.; Naito, Tadasuke; Saito, Mineki",Sci Rep,50,28

Four major nucleosides, adenosine, guanosine, cytidine and uridine, compose RNAs and provide sequence variation, but are limited in contributions to structural variation as well as distinct chemical properties. The ability of RNAs to play multiple roles in cellular metabolism is made possible by extensive variation in length, conformational dynamics, and the over 100 post-transcriptional modifications. There are several reviews of the biochemical pathways leading to RNA modification, but the physicochemical nature of modified nucleosides and how they facilitate RNA function is of keen interest, particularly with regard to the contributions of modified nucleosides. Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are the most extensively modified RNAs. The diversity of modifications provide versatility to the chemical and structural environments. The added chemistry, conformation and dynamics of modified nucleosides occurring at the termini of stems in tRNA’s cloverleaf secondary structure affect the global three-dimensional conformation, produce unique recognition determinants for macromolecules to recognize tRNAs, and affect the accurate and efficient decoding ability of tRNAs. This review will discuss the impact of specific chemical moieties on the structure, stability, electrochemical properties, and function of tRNAs.","Väre, Ville Y.

Influenza anti-viral agents, especially active small molecular inhibitors play important roles in controlling pandemics while vaccines are developed. Currently, only a few drugs, which function as influenza neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors and M2 ion channel protein inhibitors, are approved in clinical. However, the acquired resistance against current anti-influenza drugs and the emerging mutations of influenza virus itself remain the major challenging unmet medical needs for influenza treatment.

Candidate ZIKV vaccines have shown protective efficacy in preclinical studies carried out in animal models, and several vaccines have entered clinical trials. Here, we report that administration of a synthetic DNA vaccine encoding ZIKV pre-membrane and envelope (prME) completely protects mice against ZIKV-associated damage to the testes and sperm and prevents viral persistence in the testes following challenge with a contemporary strain of ZIKV.

However efficient selection may be confounded if there are different genetic strains of NNV within and between regions and over years. This study uses statistical approaches and assessment of “characteristic attributes” (i.e. nucleotide positions that discriminate among strains) to assess whether published and new NNV RNA2 cds sequences show genetic differentiation over geography, host species and years. Rather clear evidence was found for regional strains of NNV. Interestingly, most of the geographic defining “characteristic attributes” were in codon position three, and not translated into differences for the protein capsid (i.e. they were synonymous variations), suggesting that while NNV strains were geographically isolated and had diverged in different regions for RNA sequences, selection had largely conserved the protein sequences among regions. The apparent selection constraint on the capsid protein may mitigate the risk that despite geographic subdivision, NNV strain variability will confound genetic selection for host resistance. The existence of regional Asian NNV strains may suggest that hatcheries are at risk from NNV not only from imported material but also from endemic reservoirs.","Knibb, Wayne; Luu, Giang; Premachandra, H.

Such interactions are usually mediated through LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs. So far, only one viral protein has been experimentally shown to have a functional LIR motif, leaving open a vast field for investigation.

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms that regulate migration of effector T cells within the interstitial space of inflamed lungs are incompletely understood. Here, we show T cell migration in a mouse model of acute lung injury with two-photon imaging of intact lung tissue. Computational analysis indicates that T cells migrate with an intermittent mode, switching between confined and almost straight migration, guided by lung-associated vasculature. Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) is required for both high-speed migration and straight motion. By contrast, inhibition of Gα(i) signaling with pertussis toxin affects speed but not the intermittent migration of lung-infiltrating T cells. Computational modeling shows that an intermittent migration pattern balances both search area and the duration of contacts between T cells and target cells. These data identify that ROCK-dependent intermittent T cell migration regulates tissue-sampling during acute lung injury.","Mrass, Paulus; Oruganti, Sreenivasa Rao; Fricke, G.

EV71 causes Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and has been associated with neurological complications in young children. Our limited understanding of the mechanisms involved in its neuropathogenesis has hampered the development of effective therapeutic options. Here, using a two-dimensional proteomics approach combined with mass spectrometry, we have identified a unique panel of host proteins that were differentially and dynamically modulated during EV71 infection of motor-neuron NSC-34 cells, which are found at the neuromuscular junctions where EV71 is believed to enter the central nervous system. Meta-analysis with previously published proteomics studies in neuroblastoma or muscle cell lines revealed minimal overlapping which suggests unique host-pathogen interactions in NSC-34 cells. Among the candidate proteins, we focused our attention on prohibitin (PHB), a protein that is involved in multiple cellular functions and the target of anti-cancer drug Rocaglamide (Roc-A). We demonstrated that cell surface-expressed PHB is involved in EV71 entry into neuronal cells specifically, while membrane-bound mitochondrial PHB associates with the virus replication complex and facilitates viral replication. Furthermore, Roc-A treatment of EV71-infected neuronal cells reduced significantly virus yields. However, the inhibitory effect of Roc-A on PHB in NSC-34 cells was not through blocking the CRAF/MEK/ERK pathway as previously reported. Instead, Roc-A treated NSC-34 cells had lower mitochondria-associated PHB and lower ATP levels that correlated with impaired mitochondria integrity. In vivo, EV71-infected mice treated with Roc-A survived longer than the vehicle-treated animals and had significantly lower virus loads in their spinal cord and brain, whereas virus titers in their limb muscles were comparable to controls. Together, this study uncovers PHB as the first host factor that is specifically involved in EV71 neuropathogenesis and a potential drug target to limit neurological complications.","Too, Issac Horng Khit; Bonne, Isabelle; Tan, Eng Lee; Chu, Justin Jang Hann; Alonso, Sylvie",PLoS Pathog,50,1

To date, spatial resolution has only rarely been analyzed in computational/biophysical descriptions of virus replication dynamics. However, it is widely acknowledged that intracellular spatial dependence is a crucial component of virus life cycles. The hepatitis C virus-encoded NS5A protein is an endoplasmatic reticulum (ER)-anchored viral protein and an essential component of the virus replication machinery. Therefore, we simulate NS5A dynamics on realistic reconstructed, curved ER surfaces by means of surface partial differential equations (sPDE) upon unstructured grids. We match the in silico NS5A diffusion constant such that the NS5A sPDE simulation data reproduce experimental NS5A fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) time series data. This parameter estimation yields the NS5A diffusion constant. Such parameters are needed for spatial models of HCV dynamics, which we are developing in parallel but remain qualitative at this stage. Thus, our present study likely provides the first quantitative biophysical description of the movement of a viral component. Our spatio-temporal resolved ansatz paves new ways for understanding intricate spatial-defined processes central to specfic aspects of virus life cycles.","Knodel, Markus M.; Nägel, Arne; Reiter, Sebastian; Vogel, Andreas; Targett-Adams, Paul; McLauchlan, John; Herrmann, Eva; Wittum, Gabriel",Viruses,50,1

The MutPred, Provean, and PMUT bioinformatic tools were found to have the highest performance in predicting the pathogenicity effects of all 18 characterized missense variants in PITX2, all with sensitivity and specificity >93%. Applying these three programs to assess the likely pathogenicity of 13 previously uncharacterized PITX2 missense variants predicted 12/13 variants as deleterious, except A30V which was predicted as benign variant for all programs.

Here we examined the contribution of ERK1/2 in early steps of JUNV and TCRV multiplication. JUNV adsorption, internalization, and uncoating were not affected by treatment of cultured cells with U0126, an inhibitor of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. In contrast, U0126 caused a marked reduction in viral protein expression and RNA synthesis, while JUNV RNA synthesis was significantly augmented in the presence of an activator of the ERK1/2 pathway. Moreover, U0126 impaired the expression of a reporter gene in a TCRV-based replicon system, confirming the ability of the compound to hinder arenavirus macromolecular synthesis. By using a cell-based assay, we determined that the inhibitor did not affect the translation of a synthetic TCRV-like mRNA. No changes in the phosphorylation pattern of the translation factor eIF2α were found in U0126-treated cells. Our results indicate that U0126 impairs viral RNA synthesis, thereby leading to a subsequent reduction in viral protein expression. Thus, we conclude that ERK1/2 signaling activation is required for an efficient arenavirus RNA synthesis.","Brunetti, Jesús E.; Foscaldi, Sabrina; Quintana, Verónica M.; Scolaro, Luis A.; López, Nora; Castilla, Viviana",Viruses,50,1

This specificity likely depends on amino acids in α helices A and F that diverged from other IFN-λ sequences. Human IFN-λ4, in contrast, retained high activity in mouse cells. We next developed a firefly luciferase-based reporter cell line, named Fawa-λ-luc, to detect IFN-λ in biological fluids with high specificity and sensitivity. Fawa-λ-luc cells, derived from mouse epithelial cells that are responsive to IFN-λ, were made nonresponsive to type I IFNs by inactivation of the Ifnar2 gene and strongly responsive to IFN-λ by overexpression of the mouse IFNLR1. This bioassay was as sensitive as a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in detecting mouse IFN-λ in cell culture supernatant, as well as in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage samples of virus-infected mice. The assay also enabled the sensitive detection of human IFN-λ activity, including that of the divergent IFN-λ4 with a bias, however, due to variable activity of IFN-λ subtypes.","Jacobs, Sophie; Wavreil, Fanny; Schepens, Bert; Gad, Hans Henrik; Hartmann, Rune; Rocha-Pereira, Joana; Neyts, Johan; Saelens, Xavier; Michiels, Thomas",J Interferon Cytokine Res,50,1
3517,3517,3517,The Role of Lectin-Carbohydrate Interactions in the Regulation of ER-Associated Protein Degradation,11.316945,7.0593014,2015-05-27,"Proteins entering the secretory pathway are translocated across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane in an unfolded form. In the ER they are restricted to a quality control system that ensures correct folding or eventual degradation of improperly folded polypeptides. Mannose trimming of N-glycans on newly synthesized proteins plays an important role in the recognition and sorting of terminally misfolded glycoproteins for ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). In this process misfolded proteins are retrotranslocated into the cytosol, polyubiquitinated, and eventually degraded by the proteasome. The mechanism by which misfolded glycoproteins are recognized and recruited to the degradation machinery has been extensively studied during last decade. In this review, we focus on ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein (EDEM) family proteins that seem to play a key role in the discrimination between proteins undergoing a folding process and terminally misfolded proteins directed for degradation. We describe interactions of EDEM proteins with other components of the ERAD machinery, as well as with various protein substrates. Carbohydrate-dependent interactions together with N-glycan-independent interactions seem to regulate the complex process of protein recognition and direction for proteosomal degradation.","Słomińska-Wojewódzka, Monika; Sandvig, Kirsten",Molecules,50,1

Berberine and emodin possess several pharmacological properties and have been shown to be particularly effective against the entry and replication of several viruses. We show that emodin and berberine trigger a virucidal effect on ZIKV. When the virus was exposed to 160 µM of berberine, a reduction of 77.6% in the infectivity was observed; when emodin was used (40 µM), this reduction was approximately 83.3%.

The crescent-shaped bin-amphiphysin-rvs (BAR) domains remodel membranes in multiple cellular pathways. Based on studies of isolated BAR domains in vitro, the current paradigm is that BAR domain–containing proteins polymerize into cylindrical scaffolds that stabilize lipid tubules. But in nature, proteins that contain BAR domains often also contain large intrinsically disordered regions. Using in vitro and live cell assays, here we show that full-length BAR domain–containing proteins, rather than stabilizing membrane tubules, are instead surprisingly potent drivers of membrane fission. Specifically, when BAR scaffolds assemble at membrane surfaces, their bulky disordered domains become crowded, generating steric pressure that destabilizes lipid tubules. More broadly, we observe this behavior with BAR domains that have a range of curvatures. These data suggest that the ability to concentrate disordered domains is a key driver of membrane remodeling and fission by BAR domain–containing proteins.","Snead, Wilton T.; Zeno, Wade F.; Kago, Grace; Perkins, Ryan W.; Richter, J Blair; Zhao, Chi; Lafer, Eileen M.; Stachowiak, Jeanne C.",J Cell Biol,50,8

Specifically, Pseudorabies virus (PRV), Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), Classical swine fever virus (CSFV), Swine influenza virus (SIV) as enveloped viruses and Porcine parvovirus (PPV), Swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) and Senecavirus A (SVA) as non-enveloped viruses, were inoculated in bovine or porcine plasma and subjected to different UV-C irradiation doses (0, 750, 1500, 3000, 6000 and 9000 J/L) using an UV-C device developed for opaque liquid working under turbulent flow. The enveloped viruses tested were inactivated at < 3000 J/L of UV-C, being the dose needed to inactivate 4 log TCID(50) (4D) of 1612 J/L for PRV,1004 J/L for PRRSV, 1953 J/L for PEDV, 1639 J/L for SIV, 1641 J/L for CSFV and 1943 J/L for BVDV. The non-enveloped viruses tended to have higher 4D values: 2161 J/L for PPV, 3223 J/L for SVA and 3708 J/L for SVDV. Because the initial viral concentration was <4.0 Log for PCV-2, it was not possible to calculate the 4D value for this virus. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that the SurePure Turbulator UV-C treatment system is capable of inactivating significant levels of swine viruses inoculated in commercially collected porcine or bovine plasma. It was concluded that irradiation with UV-C can provide an additional redundant biosafety feature in the manufacturing process of spray-dried animal plasma.","Blázquez, Elena; Rodríguez, Carmen; Ródenas, Jesús; Navarro, Núria; Riquelme, Cristina; Rosell, Rosa; Campbell, Joy; Crenshaw, Joe; Segalés, Joaquim; Pujols, Joan; Polo, Javier",PLoS One,50,1

Besides the consensus that spontaneous conversion of normal cellular PrP(C) into misfolded and aggregating PrP(Sc) is the central event in prion disease, an alternative hypothesis suggests the generation of pathological PrP(Sc) by rare translational frameshifting events in the octa-repeat domain of the PrP mRNA. Ribosomal frameshifting most commonly relies on a slippery site and an adjacent stable RNA structure to stall translating ribosome. Hence, it is crucial to unravel the secondary structure of the octa-repeat domain of PrP mRNA. Each of the five octa-repeats contains a motif (GGCGGUGGUGGCUGGG) which alone in vitro forms a G-quadruplex. Since the propensity of mRNA to form secondary structure depends on the sequence context, we set to determine the structure of the complete octa-repeat region. We assessed the structure of full-length octa-repeat domain of PrP mRNA using dynamic light scattering (DLS), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analysis by primer extension (SHAPE). Our data show that the PrP octa-repeat mRNA forms stable A-helical hairpins with no evidence of G-quadruplex structure even in the presence of G-quadruplex stabilizing agents.","Czech, Andreas; Konarev, Petr V.; Goebel, Ingrid; Svergun, Dmitri I.; Wills, Peter R.; Ignatova, Zoya",Sci Rep,50,1

During infection, their genomes are carried in capsids across the membranes of host cells to sites of virion production by exploiting cellular behaviour and resources to guide and achieve all aspects of delivery and the downstream virus manufacturing process. Successful entry hinges on execution of a precisely tuned viral uncoating program where incoming capsids disassemble in consecutive steps to ensure that genomes are released at the right time, and in the right place for replication to occur. Each step of disassembly is cell-assisted, involving individual pathways that transmit signals to regulate discrete functions, but at the same time, these signalling pathways are organized into larger networks, which communicate back and forth in complex ways in response to the presence of virus. In this review, we consider the elegant strategy by which adenoviruses (AdVs) target and navigate cellular networks to initiate the production of progeny virions. There are many remarkable aspects about the AdV entry program; for example, the virus gains targeted control of a large well-defined local network neighbourhood by coupling several interacting processes (including endocytosis, autophagy and microtubule trafficking) around a collective reference state centred on the interactional topology and multifunctional nature of protein VI. Understanding the network targeting activity of protein VI, as well as other built-in mechanisms that allow AdV particles to be efficient at navigating the subsystems of the cell, can be used to improve viral vectors, but also has potential to be incorporated for use in entirely novel delivery systems.","Flatt, Justin W.; Butcher, Sarah J.",Open Biol,50,8

The introduction of high-throughput sequencing (HTS)-based methods has paved the way for genomics-based detection of pathogens without any prior assumptions about the characteristics of the organisms. However, the use of HTS for the characterization of viral pathogens from clinical samples remains limited. Here, we report the identification of a novel Orthobunyavirus species isolated from horse plasma. The identification was based on a straightforward HTS approach. Following enrichment in cell culture, RNA was extracted from the growth medium and rapid library preparation, HTS and primary bioinformatic analyses were performed in less than 12 hours. Taxonomical profiling of the sequencing reads did not reveal sequence similarities to any known virus. Subsequent application of de novo assembly tools to the sequencing reads produced contigs, of which three showed some similarity to the L, M, and S segments of viruses belonging to the Orthobunyavirus genus. Further refinement of these contigs resulted in high-quality, full-length genomic sequences of the three genomic segments (L, M and S) of a novel Orthobunyavirus. Characterization of the genomic sequence, including the prediction of open reading frames and the inspection of consensus genomic termini and phylogenetic analysis, further confirmed that the novel virus is indeed a new species, which we named Ness Ziona virus.","Shifman, Ohad; Cohen-Gihon, Inbar; Beth-Din, Adi; Zvi, Anat; Laskar, Orly; Paran, Nir; Epstein, Eyal; Stein, Dana; Dorozko, Marina; Wolf, Dana; Yitzhaki, Shmuel; Shapira, Shmuel C.; Melamed, Sharon; Israeli, Ofir",Sci Rep,50,1

Quasi-enveloped HAV (eHAV) mediates stealthy cell-to-cell spread within the liver, whereas stable naked virions shed in feces are optimized for environmental transmission. eHAV lacks virus-encoded surface proteins, and how it enters cells is unknown. We show both virion types enter by clathrin- and dynamin-dependent endocytosis, facilitated by integrin β(1), and traffic through early and late endosomes. Uncoating of naked virions occurs in late endosomes, whereas eHAV undergoes ALIX-dependent trafficking to lysosomes where the quasi-envelope is enzymatically degraded and uncoating ensues coincident with breaching of endolysosomal membranes. Neither virion requires PLA2G16, a phospholipase essential for entry of other picornaviruses. Thus naked and quasi-enveloped virions enter via similar endocytic pathways, but uncoat in different compartments and release their genomes to the cytosol in a manner mechanistically distinct from other Picornaviridae.","Rivera-Serrano, Efraín E; González-López, Olga; Das, Anshuman; Lemon, Stanley M",,50,11

Currently, commercially available vaccines are ineffective for controlling porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in pigs. Therefore, a pharmacological intervention may represent an alternative control measure for PRRSV infection. Hence, the present study evaluated the effects of DiNap on the replication of VR2332 (a prototype strain of type 2 PRRSV). Initially, in vitro antiviral assays against VR2332 were performed in MARC-145 cells and porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Following this, a pilot study was conducted in a pig model to demonstrate the effects of DiNap following VR2332 infection. DiNap inhibited VR2332 replication in both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, and viral growth was completely suppressed at concentrations ≥0.06 mM, without significant cytotoxicity. Consistent with these findings, in the pig study, DiNap also reduced viral loads in the serum and lungs and enhanced the weight gain of pigs following VR2332 infection, as indicated by comparison of the DiNap-treated groups to the untreated control (NC) group. In addition, DiNap-treated pigs had fewer gross and microscopic lesions in their lungs than NC pigs. Notably, virus transmission was also delayed by approximately 1 week in uninfected contact pigs within the same group after treatment with DiNap. Taken together, these results suggest that DiNap has potential anti-PRRSV activity and could be useful as a prophylactic or post-exposure treatment drug to control PRRSV infection in pigs.","Khatun, Amina; Park, Sun You; Shabir, Nadeem; Nazki, Salik; Kang, A-Rum; Jeong, Chang-Gi; Seo, Byoung-Joo; Yang, Myeon-Sik; Kim, Bumseok; Seo, Young Ho; Kim, Won-Il",Molecules,50,1

Most of these derivatives showed moderate to potent anti-proliferative activities. Notably, compound 7a exhibited potent anti-proliferative activity against HepG2 cells with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) value of 4.95 µM, which was enhanced 8.8-fold compared to the parent compound emodin (IC(50) = 43.87 µM), and it also exhibited better selective anti-proliferative activity and specificity than emodin. Moreover, further experiments demonstrated that compound 7a displayed a significant efficacy of inducing apoptosis through mitochondrial pathway via release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, inducing cell arrest at G0/G1 phase, as well as suppression of cell migration of tumor cells.

3752,3752,3752,Innate Immune Responses to Avian Influenza Viruses in Ducks and Chickens,11.186064,7.228814,2019-01-10,"Mallard ducks are important natural hosts of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses and many strains circulate in this reservoir and cause little harm. Some strains can be transmitted to other hosts, including chickens, and cause respiratory and systemic disease. Rarely, these highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses cause disease in mallards, while chickens are highly susceptible. The long co-evolution of mallard ducks with influenza viruses has undoubtedly fine-tuned many immunological host–pathogen interactions to confer resistance to disease, which are poorly understood. Here, we compare innate responses to different avian influenza viruses in ducks and chickens to reveal differences that point to potential mechanisms of disease resistance. Mallard ducks are permissive to LPAI replication in their intestinal tissues without overtly compromising their fitness. In contrast, the mallard response to HPAI infection reflects an immediate and robust induction of type I interferon and antiviral interferon stimulated genes, highlighting the importance of the RIG-I pathway. Ducks also appear to limit the duration of the response, particularly of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Chickens lack RIG-I, and some modulators of the signaling pathway and may be compromised in initiating an early interferon response, allowing more viral replication and consequent damage. We review current knowledge about innate response mediators to influenza infection in mallard ducks compared to chickens to gain insight into protective immune responses, and open questions for future research.","Evseev, Danyel; Magor, Katharine E.",Vet Sci,50,1

However, how Golgi destruction affects other cellular activities is so far unknown. Here, we report that depletion of GRASP proteins reduces cell attachment and migration. Interestingly, GRASP depletion reduces the protein level of α5β1 integrin, the major cell adhesion molecule at the surface of HeLa and MDA-MB-231 cells, due to decreased integrin protein synthesis. GRASP depletion also increases cell growth and total protein synthesis.

Over the last 15 years, the number of its recognized species has grown from 77 to 106, but knowledge of their interrelationships has not kept pace. Species limits and phylogenetic relationships of this morphologically conservative group remain problematic due both to poor sampling across the Afrotropics and to repeated instances of mitochondrial-nuclear discordance. Recent intensive surveys in East Africa and neighboring regions, coupled with parallel studies by others in West Africa and in Southern Africa, offer a new basis for understanding its evolutionary history. RESULTS: We investigated phylogenetic relationships and intraspecific genetic variation in the Afro-Palearctic clade of Rhinolophidae using broad sampling. We sequenced mitochondrial cytochrome-b (1140 bp) and four independent and informative nuclear introns (2611 bp) for 213 individuals and incorporated sequence data from 210 additional individuals on GenBank that together represent 24 of the 33 currently recognized Afrotropical Rhinolophus species. We addressed the widespread occurrence of mito-nuclear discordance in Rhinolophus by inferring concatenated and species tree phylogenies using only the nuclear data. Well resolved mitochondrial, concatenated nuclear, and species trees revealed phylogenetic relationships and population structure of the Afrotropical species and species groups. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple well-supported and deeply divergent lineages were resolved in each of the six African Rhinolophus species groups analyzed, suggesting as many as 12 undescribed cryptic species; these include several instances of sympatry among close relatives. Coalescent lineage delimitation offered support for new undescribed lineages in four of the six African groups in this study. On the other hand, two to five currently recognized species may be invalid based on combined mitochondrial and/or nuclear phylogenetic analyses. Validation of these cryptic lineages as species and formal relegation of current names to synonymy will require integrative taxonomic assessments involving morphology, ecology, acoustics, distribution, and behavior. The resulting phylogenetic framework offers a powerful basis for addressing questions regarding their ecology and evolution.

After entering into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), secretory proteins attain their native structure thanks to specific chaperones and enzymes. Only correctly folded molecules are allowed by quality control (QC) mechanisms to leave the ER and proceed to downstream compartments. Proteins that cannot fold properly are instead retained in the ER to be finally destined to proteasomal degradation. Exiting from the ER requires, in most cases, the use of coated vesicles, departing at the ER exit sites, which will fuse with the Golgi compartment, thus releasing their cargoes. Protein accumulation in the ER can be caused by a too stringent QC or by ineffective transport: these situations could be deleterious for the organism, due to the loss of the secreted protein, and to the cell itself, because of abnormal increase of protein concentration in the ER. In both cases, diseases can arise. In this review, we will describe the pathophysiology of protein folding and transport between the ER and the Golgi compartment.","Anelli, Tiziana; Panina-Bordignon, Paola",Cells,50,1

In the current study, the gp85 protein of ALV-J was expressed on the surface of L. plantarum with the surface-display motif, pgsA, by constructing a shuttle vector pMG36e:pgsA:gp85. Surface localization of the fusion protein was verified by western blotting and flow cytometry. Subsequently, Specific Pathogen Free Hy-Line Brown layer chickens were orally vaccinated with the recombinant L. plantarum and presented with high levels of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) titers in bile and duodenal-mucosal fluid. After challenged with ALV-J of a 3 × 10(3) 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50), serum samples of the chickens were collected and viremia was analyzed. Results showed that, compared to the L. plantarum and PBS control group, the recombinant L. plantarum group showed a significant rise in antibody levels after inoculation, and provide improved protection against ALV-J according to viremia detection. These results indicate that oral immunization with the recombinant L. plantarum provided an effective means for eliciting protective immune response against early ALV-J infection.","Wang, Shenghua; Geng, Na; Zhou, Dong; Qu, Yi; Shi, Mengke; Xu, Yuliang; Liu, Kangping; Liu, Yongxia; Liu, Jianzhu",Front Immunol,50,1

Among cargoes, recombinant proteins offer therapeutic promise but the lack of effective delivery methods limits their development. Here, we achieve protein and SpCas9 or AsCas12a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) delivery to cultured human well-differentiated airway epithelial cells and mouse lungs with engineered amphiphilic peptides. These shuttle peptides, non-covalently combined with GFP protein or CRISPR-associated nuclease (Cas) RNP, allow rapid entry into cultured human ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial cells and mouse airway epithelia. Instillation of shuttle peptides combined with SpCas9 or AsCas12a RNP achieves editing of loxP sites in airway epithelia of ROSA(mT/mG) mice. We observe no evidence of short-term toxicity with a widespread distribution restricted to the respiratory tract.

IAVs cause a wide range of clinical illnesses, from relatively mild infections by seasonal strains, to acute respiratory distress during infections with highly pathogenic avian IAVs (HPAI). For this study, we infected A549 human lung cells with lab prototype A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8), a seasonal H1N1 (RV733), the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pdm09), or with two avian strains, an H5N1 HPAI strain or an H7N9 strain that has low pathogenicity in birds but high pathogenicity in humans. We used a newly-developed aptamer-based multiplexed technique (SOMAscan(®)) to examine >1300 human lung cell proteins affected by the different IAV strains, and identified more than 500 significantly dysregulated cellular proteins. Our analyses indicated that the avian strains induced more profound changes in the A549 global proteome compared to all tested low-pathogenicity H1N1 strains. The PR8 strain induced a general activation, primarily by upregulating many immune molecules, the seasonal RV733 and pdm09 strains had minimal effect upon assayed molecules, and the avian strains induced significant downregulation, primarily in antimicrobial response, cardiovascular and post-translational modification systems.","Coombs, Kevin M.; Simon, Philippe F.; McLeish, Nigel J.; Zahedi-Amiri, Ali; Kobasa, Darwyn",Viruses,50,1
4239,4239,4239,A natural polymorphism in Zika virus NS2A protein responsible of virulence in mice,11.257871,6.961789,2019-12-27,"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is currently one of the major concerns in human public health due to its association with neurological disorders. Intensive effort has been implemented for the treatment of ZIKV, however there are not currently approved vaccines or antivirals available to combat ZIKV infection. In this sense, the identification of virulence factors associated with changes in ZIKV virulence could help to develop safe and effective countermeasures to treat ZIKV or to prevent future outbreaks. Here, we have compared the virulence of two related ZIKV strains from the recent outbreak in Brazil (2015), Rio Grande do Norte Natal (RGN) and Paraiba. In spite of both viruses being identified in the same period of time and region, significant differences in virulence and replication were observed using a validated mouse model of ZIKV infection. While ZIKV-RGN has a 50% mouse lethal dose (MLD(50)) of ~10(5) focus forming units (FFUs), ZIKV-Paraiba infection resulted in 100% of lethality with less than 10 FFUs. Combining deep-sequencing analysis and our previously described infectious ZIKV-RGN cDNA clone, we identified a natural polymorphism in the non-structural protein 2 A (NS2A) that increase the virulence of ZIKV. Moreover, results demonstrate that the single amino acid alanine to valine substitution at position 117 (A117V) in the NS2A was sufficient to convert the attenuated rZIKV-RGN in a virulent Paraiba-like virus (MLD(50) < 10 FFU). The mechanism of action was also evaluated and data indicate that substitution A117V in ZIKV NS2A protein reduces host innate immune responses and viral-induced apoptosis in vitro. Therefore, amino acid substitution A117V in ZIKV NS2A could be used as a genetic risk-assessment marker for future ZIKV outbreaks.","Ávila-Pérez, Gines; Nogales, Aitor; Park, Jun-Gyu; Márquez-Jurado, Silvia; Iborra, Francisco J.; Almazan, Fernando; Martínez-Sobrido, Luis",Sci Rep,50,28

The more recent ZIKV outbreaks in the Americas and the Caribbean associated with congenital malformations and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults have placed public health officials in high alert and highlight the significant impact of ZIKV on human health. New technologies to study the biology of ZIKV and to develop more effective prevention options are highly desired. In this study we demonstrate that direct delivery in mice of an infectious ZIKV cDNA clone allows the rescue of recombinant (r)ZIKV in vivo. A bacterial artificial chromosome containing the sequence of ZIKV strain Paraiba/2015 under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was complexed with a commercial transfection reagent and administrated using different routes in type-I interferon receptor deficient A129 mice. Clinical signs and death associated with ZIKV viremia were observed in mice. The rZIKV recovered from these mice remained fully virulent in a second passage in mice. Interestingly, infectious rZIKV was also recovered after intraperitoneal inoculation of the rZIKV cDNA in the absence of transfection reagent. Further expanding these studies, we demonstrate that a single intraperitoneal inoculation of a cDNA clone encoding an attenuated rZIKV was safe, highly immunogenic, and provided full protection against lethal ZIKV challenge. This novel in vivo reverse genetics method is a potentially suitable delivery platform for the study of wild-type and live-attenuated ZIKV devoid of confounding factors typical associated with in vitro systems. Moreover, our results open the possibility of employing similar in vivo reverse genetic approaches for the generation of other viruses and, therefore, change the way we will use reverse genetics in the future.","Ávila-Pérez, Gines; Nogales, Aitor; Park, Jun-Gyu; Vasquez, Desarey Morales; Dean, David A.; Barravecchia, Michael; Perez, Daniel R.; Almazán, Fernando; Martínez-Sobrido, Luis",Sci Rep,50,28

Diagnosis remains a cornerstone to the Peste des petits ruminants Global Control and Eradication Strategy, an initiative of the World Organisation for Animal Health and the Food and Agriculture Organisation. The present review presents the peste des petits ruminants diagnostic landscape, including the practicality of commercially available diagnostic tools, prototype tests and opportunities for new technologies. The most common peste des petits ruminants diagnostic tools include; agar gel immunodiffusion, counter-immunoelectrophoresis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction either gel-based or real-time, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification, reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assays, immunochromatographic lateral flow devices, luciferase immunoprecipitation system and pseudotype-based assays. These tests vary in their technical demands, but all require a laboratory with exception of immunochromatographic lateral flow and possibly reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification and reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assays. Thus, we are proposing an efficient integration of diagnostic tests for rapid and correct identification of peste des petits ruminants in endemic zones and to rapidly confirm outbreaks. Deployment of pen-side tests will improve diagnostic capacity in extremely remote settings and susceptible wildlife ecosystems, where transportation of clinical samples in the optimum cold chain is unreliable.","Kinimi, Edson; Odongo, Steven; Muyldermans, Serge; Kock, Richard; Misinzo, Gerald",Acta Vet Scand,50,1

Since the Ebola virus was discovered in 1976, the only available treatments have been medical support or the emergency administration of experimental drugs. The absence of licensed vaccines and drugs against the Ebola virus impedes the prevention of viral infection. In this study, we generated recombinant baculoviruses (rBV) expressing the Sudan virus (SUDV) matrix structural protein (VP40) (rBV-VP40-VP40) or the SUDV glycoprotein (GP) (rBV-GP-GP), and SUDV virus-like particles (VLPs) were produced by co-infection of Sf9 cells with rBV-SUDV-VP40 and rBV-SUDV-GP. The expression of SUDV VP40 and GP in SUDV VLPs was demonstrated by IFA and Western blot analysis. Electron microscopy results demonstrated that SUDV VLPs had a filamentous morphology. The immunogenicity of SUDV VLPs produced in insect cells was evaluated by the immunization of mice. The analysis of antibody responses showed that mice vaccinated with SUDV VLPs and the adjuvant Montanide ISA 201 produced SUDV GP-specific IgG antibodies. Sera from SUDV VLP-immunized mice were able to block infection by SUDV GP pseudotyped HIV, indicating that a neutralizing antibody against the SUDV GP protein was produced. Furthermore, the activation of B cells in the group immunized with VLPs mixed with Montanide ISA 201 was significant one week after the primary immunization. Vaccination with the SUDV VLPs markedly increased the frequency of antigen-specific cells secreting type 1 and type 2 cytokines. To study the therapeutic effects of SUDV antibodies, horses were immunized with SUDV VLPs emulsified in Freund’s complete adjuvant or Freund’s incomplete adjuvant. The results showed that horses could produce SUDV GP-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies. These results showed that SUDV VLPs demonstrate excellent immunogenicity and represent a promising approach for vaccine development against SUDV infection. Further, these horse anti-SUDV purified immunoglobulins lay a foundation for SUDV therapeutic drug research.","Wu, Fangfang; Zhang, Shengnan; Zhang, Ying; Mo, Ruo; Yan, Feihu; Wang, Hualei; Wong, Gary; Chi, Hang; Wang, Tiecheng; Feng, Na; Gao, Yuwei; Xia, Xianzhu; Zhao, Yongkun; Yang, Songtao",Viruses,50,1

However, there is still much to be learned regarding the effectiveness of LTP on bacteria in suspension in liquids, and especially on porous surfaces. We investigated the efficacy of LTP treatments against bacteria using an atmospheric-pressure plasma jet and show that LTP treatments have the ability to inhibit both gram-positive (S. aureus) and gram-negative (E. coli) bacteria on solid and porous surfaces. Additionally, both direct LTP treatment and plasma-activated media were effective against the bacteria suspended in liquid culture. Our data indicate that reactive oxygen species are the key mediators of the bactericidal effects of LTP and hydrogen peroxide is necessary but not sufficient for antibacterial effects. In addition, our data suggests that bacteria exposed to LTP do not develop resistance to further treatment with LTP.

Aberrant expression of Class II major histocompatibility complex molecules was demonstrated immunohistochemically on insulin secreting B cells in 21 out of 23 patients with recent onset disease and 6 of the patients with more prolonged disease. No such expression was seen on glucagon secreting A cells or somatostatin secreting D cells.

Ninety-two per cent of insulin containing islets but only 1% of insulin deficient islets exhibited this phenomenon (p<0.001, Chi-squared test). There was evidence to suggest that both these abnormalities of major histocompatibility complex expression preceded insulitis within a given islet. They also appeared to be unique to Type 1 diabetes, being absent in pancreases of patients with Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes, chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, graft-versus-host disease and Coxsackie B viral pancreatitis. The development of autoimmunity to B cells in Type 1 diabetes may be a “multistep” process in which abnormalities of major histocompatibility complex expression on islet endocrine cells are crucial events.","Foulis, A.

They can be thought of as playing one of two general roles in viral morphogenesis. Structural proteins are encoded by retroviruses and many RNA viruses as part of large polyproteins. Their proteolytic release is a prerequisite to particle assembly; consequent structural rearrangement of the capsid domains serves to regulate and direct association and assembly of capsid subunits.

A manual search of papers addressing the microorganisms causing acute bronchitis was also done. Data were extracted manually from relevant publications. SETTING: All published reports were reviewed. Papers dealing with exacerbations of chronic bronchitis were excluded in this review. RESULTS: Although acute bronchitis has multiple causes, the large majority of cases are of viral etiology.Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, andBordetella pertussis are the only bacteria identified as contributing to the cause of acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults.

One study using erythromycin and one study using trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole showed that these antibiotics were slightly better than placebo. Two other studies showed an impressive superiority for liquid or inhaled albuterol when compared with erythromycin. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies showed no significant difference between drug and placebo, and the two studies that did showed only small clinical differences.

The result shows that the overall extent of codon usage bias in NDV is low (mean ENC = 56.15 > 40). The good correlation between the (C + G)(12)% and (G + C)(3)% suggests that the mutational pressure, rather than natural selection, is the main factor that determines the codon usage bias and base component in NDV. It is observed that synonymous codon usage pattern in NDV genes is gene function and geography specific, but not host specific. By contrasting synonymous codon usage patterns of different NDV isolates, we suggest that more than one genotype of NDV circulates in waterfowl in USA; and gene length has no significant effect on the variations of synonymous codon usage in these virus genes. CpG under-represented is a characteristic for NDV to fit in its host.

Initial rates of ascorbate uptake were diminished by lowering the external concentrations of either Ca(2+) or Na(+). The Na(+)-dependence of astroglial ascorbate uptake gave Hill coefficients of approximately 2, consistent with a Na(+)-ascorbate cotransport system having stoichiometry of 2 Na(+)∶1 ascorbate anion. Raising external K(+) concentration incrementally from 5.4 to 100 mM, so as to depolarize the plasma membrane, decreased the initial rate of ascorbate uptake, with the degree of inhibition depending on the level of K(+). The depolarizing ionophores gramicidin and nystatin slowed ascorbate uptake by astrocytes incubated in 5.4 mM K(+); whereas, the nondepolarizing ionophore valinomycin did not. Qualitatively similar results were obtained whether or not astrocytes were pretreated with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (0.25 mM for 2 weeks) to induce stellation. These data are consistent with the existence of an electrogenic Na(+)-ascorbate cotransport system through which the rate of ascorbate uptake is modulated by endogenous agents, such as K(+), that alter astroglial membrane potential.","Wilson, John X.; Jaworski, Ewa M.; Dixon, S.

Analytical results are obtained using the respective ratios of susceptible, exposed (incubating), and asymptomatic classes to the clinical symptomatic infective class. Conditions are given for bistability of equilibria to occur, where trajectories with distinct initial values could result in either a major outbreak where the disease spreads to the whole population or a lesser outbreak where some members of the population remain uninfected. This dynamic behavior did not arise in a SARS model without asymptomatic infective class studied by Hsu and Hsieh (SIAM J. Appl. Math. 66(2), 627–647, 2006). Hence, this illustrates that depending on the initial states, control of a disease outbreak with asymptomatic infections may involve more than simply reducing the reproduction number. Moreover, the presence of asymptomatic infections could result in either a positive or negative impact on the outbreak, depending on different sets of conditions on the parameters, as illustrated with numerical simulations.

Results evidently showed that coumermycin A1 (C–A1), a recently discovered Hsp90 inhibitor, binds at the dimer’s active site of the Hsp90 protein and leads to a substantial parting between dimeric opposed residues, which include Arg591.B, Lys594.A, Ser663.A, Thr653.B, Ala665.A, Thr649.B, Leu646.B and Asn669.A.

These findings were further validated by principal component analysis.

As the philosophy and practice of advanced care for tiny infants becomes more acceptable and affordable in the country, a steady increase in survival of such infants is predictable. However there is growing concern in India that NEC could become a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality in the future. NEC is currently regarded as the most common acquired gastrointestinal emergency in the newborn period, and the outcome of this disease is universally poor. Improved understanding of the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of this condition is required for formulating optimal principles of prevention and management.","Kulkarni, Anjali; Vigneswaran, R.",Indian J Pediatr,50,1

Recovery of neutrophils, whether prior to or after initiation of IMV, was associated with a significantly decreased risk of death relative to never achieving neutrophil recovery. A transient increase in acuity (by oxygenation index and vasopressor requirements) occurred among a subset of the patients who achieved neutrophil recovery after initiation of IMV; 61.5% of these patients survived to discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU). Improved survival among patients who subsequently achieved neutrophil recovery on IMV was not limited to those with peri-engraftment respiratory distress syndrome. The presence of a respiratory pathogen did not affect the risk of death while on IMV but was associated with an increased length of IMV (p < 0.01). Among patients undergoing HCT who develop respiratory failure and require advanced therapeutic support, neutrophil recovery at time of IMV and/or presence of a respiratory pathogen should not be used as determining factors when counseling families about survival.","Moffet, J.

To effectively monitor, design, or intervene in such epidemic-like processes, there is a need to predict the speed of a particular contagion in a particular network, and to distinguish between nodes that are more likely to become infected sooner or later during an outbreak. Here, we study these quantities using a message-passing approach to derive simple and effective predictions that are validated against epidemic simulations on a variety of real-world networks with good agreement. In addition to individualized predictions for different nodes, we find an overall sudden transition from low density to almost full network saturation as the contagion progresses in time. Our theory is developed and explained in the setting of simple contagions on treelike networks, but we are also able to show how the method extends remarkably well to complex contagions and highly clustered networks.","Moore, Sam; Rogers, Tim",,50,28

In addition, the development of vaccines against chronic diseases has attracted considerable interest as an approach to prevent, rather than treat, conditions such as cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and others. Subunit vaccines consist of nongenetic components of the infectious agent or disease-related epitope. In this Review, we discuss peptide-based vaccines and their potential in three therapeutic areas: infectious disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and cancer. We discuss factors that contribute to vaccine efficacy and how these parameters may potentially be modulated by design. We examine both clinically tested vaccines as well as nascent approaches and explore current challenges and potential remedies. While peptide vaccines hold substantial promise in the prevention of human disease, many obstacles remain that have hampered their clinical use; thus, continued research efforts to address these challenges are warranted.","Malonis, Ryan J.; Lai, Jonathan R.; Vergnolle, Olivia",Chem Rev,50,1

Despite reports of its possible role in insulin exocytosis and cell proliferation, its function in beta cells remains controversial. We aimed to characterise the function of TMEM27 in islets and its potential use as a beta cell mass biomarker. METHODS: To determine TMEM27 function, we studied TMEM27 gene expression and localisation in human healthy and diabetic islets, the correlation of its expression with cell cycle and insulin secretion genes in human islets, its expression in tungstate-treated rats, and the effects of its overproduction on insulin secretion and proliferation in a beta cell line and islets. To elucidate its utility as a beta cell mass biomarker, we studied TMEM27 cleavage in a beta cell line, islets and primary proximal tubular cells. RESULTS: TMEM27 mRNA levels in islets are lower in diabetic donors than in controls. Its gene expression correlates with that of insulin and SNAPIN in human islets. TMEM27 expression is downregulated in islets of tungstate-treated rats, which exhibit decreased insulin secretion and increased proliferation. TMEM27 overproduction in a beta cell line and islets significantly enhanced glucose-induced insulin secretion, with modest or no effects on proliferation. Finally, TMEM27 is cleaved and shed by renal proximal tubular cells and pancreatic islets. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data support a role for TMEM27 in glucose-induced insulin secretion but not in cell proliferation. The finding that its cleavage is not specific to beta cells challenges the current support for its use as a potential beta cell mass biomarker.

However, because of high rates of graft failure and relapse, elutriation alone has not improved survival. We have carried out a phase II clinical trial in 54 pediatric patients to determine if CD34+ selection to rescue pluripotent stem cells from the small lymphocyte fraction improves engraftment. The processed grafts contained a mean of 5.5 × 10(7) cells/kg IBW, 4.7 × 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg IBW, and 6.3 × 10(5) CD3+cells/kg IBW. Patients achieved an ANC >500 at a median of 16 days and platelet count >20 000 at a median of 28 days. The incidence of clinically significant GVHD was 19%. In total, 10 patients enrolled in this study experienced graft failure, with eight of the 14 patients transplanted for nonmalignant indications failing to engraft stably. Graft failure was statistically significantly associated with nonmalignant diagnosis (P<0.001), but was not associated with CMV seropositivity, donor gender, or cell counts of the allograft. We conclude that although time to engraftment is similar to that seen with unmanipulated grafts, graft failure remains a significant problem in patients with hereditary, nonmalignant diseases. Future efforts will seek to preserve the benefits of elutriation with CD34+ selection by increasing immune ablation of the preparative regimen and/or increasing posttransplant immune suppression.","McDonough, C H; Jacobsohn, D A; Vogelsang, G B; Noga, S J; Chen, A R",Bone Marrow Transplant,50,8

Production of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α, IL-1β, and IL-8 is regulated in part by the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10. For preterm newborns with hyaline membrane disease, deficiencies in the ability of lung macrophages to express antiinflammatory cytokines may predispose to chronic lung inflammation. We compared the expression of pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines at the mRNA and protein level in the lungs of preterm and term newborns with acute respiratory failure from hyaline membrane disease or meconium aspiration syndrome. Four sequential bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were obtained during the first 96 h of life from all patients. All patients rapidly developed an influx of neutrophils and macrophages. Over time, cell populations in both groups became relatively enriched with macrophages. The expression of proinflammatory cytokine mRNA and/or protein was present in all samples from both patient groups. In contrast, IL-10 mRNA was undetectable in most of the cell samples from preterm infants and present in the majority of cell samples from term infants. IL-10 concentrations were undetectable in lavage fluid from preterm infants with higher levels in a few of the BAL samples from term infants. These studies demonstrate that1) IL-10 mRNA and protein expression by lung inflammatory cells is related to gestational age and 2) during the first 96 h of life neutrophil cell counts and IL-8 expression decrease in BAL from term infants, but remain unchanged in BAL samples from preterm infants.","Jones, Craig A; Cayabyab, Rowena G; Kwong, Kenny Y C; Stotts, Cynthia; Wong, Betty; Hamdan, Hasnah; Minoo, Parviz; Delemos, Robert A",Pediatr Res,50,1

The main cortical and subcortical brain areas of 50 polydrug deaths were analyzed as compared with controls. In the brains of drug abusers, a significant neuronal loss was present. Interestingly, the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes was reduced. the numerical density of perivascular and parenchymal microglia was increased in the white matter and in most subcortical regions. In the white matter there were widespread β-amyloid precursor protein deposits. Furthermore, there was a prominent vascular hyalinosis, endothelial cell proliferation, and a loss of immunoreactivity for collagen type IV within the vascular basal lamina. The neuronal loss seems to be the result of a direct impairment of nerve cells and, indirectly, to a damage of astrocytes, axons, and the microvasculature. The reduction of GFAP-positive astrocytes is also indicative of a drug-induced damage. The axonal injury suggests a toxic-metabolic drug effect, whereas the concomitant activation of microglia is indicative of a long-standing progressive process. The noninflammatory vasculopathy can be considered as the morphological substrate of a disturbed blood-brain barrier. Our findings demonstrate that drugs of abuse initiate a cascade of interacting toxic, vascular, and hypoxic factors that finally result in widespread disturbances within the complex network of central nervous system cell-cell interactions.","Büttner, Andreas; Weis, Serge",Forensic Sci Med Pathol,50,28

This study was to assess the surgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma and analyze the prognostic factors influencing postoperative survival. One hundred forty-two patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection between January 2006 and December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively based on clinicopathological and demographic data. Univariate and multivariate analysis against outcome were employed to identify potential factors affecting prognosis. Ninety-five patients were performed with R0 resection with median survival time of 22 months; whereas, 47 patients underwent non-R0 resection (R1 = 20, R2 = 27) with that of 10 months. Of these 95 patients, 19 underwent concomitant with vascular resection and reconstruction and 2 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. 64.8% patients (n = 92) underwent combined with hepatectomy. The one-year, three-year, and five-year survival rates after R0 resection were 76.3, 27.8, 11.3%, respectively, which was significantly better than that after non-curative resection (P = 0.000). Multivariate analysis revealed that non-curative resection (RR: 2.414, 95% CI 1.586–3.676, P = 0.000), pathological differentiation (P = 0.015) and preoperative serum total bilirubin above 10 mg/dL (RR: 1.844, 95% CI 1.235–2.752, P = 0.003) were independent prognostic factors. Aggressive curative resection remains to be the optimal option for hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Non-curative resection, pathological differentiation, and preoperative serum total bilirubin above 10 mg/ dL were associated with dismal prognosis.","Yu, Zhimin; Zhu, Jie; Jiang, Hai; He, Chuanchao; Xiao, Zhiyu; Wang, Jie; Xu, Junyao",Indian J Surg,50,28

Bacterial outer membrane proteins (OMP) were selected as target antigens. The ISA Brown hens, specific-Salmonella spp.-free status, divided into 6 groups were intramuscularly injected with a mono-compound antigen preparation: SE-OMP (treatment SE-FA or SE-IM) or ST-OMP (treatment ST-FA or ST-IM), or a combined antigen preparation: ½ SE-OMP and ½ STOMP (treatment SEST-FA or SEST-IM). Titers of antibodies in yolk were evaluated biweekly with ELISA. There was no antigen × adjuvant interaction on antibody titers. Anti-SE IgY titers in hens that received treatment SEST-FA or SEST-IM were statistically similar (P > 0.05) as compared with those obtained from hens immunized with treatment SE-FA or SE-IM. Anti-ST IgY titers in hens immunized with treatment SEST-FA or SEST-IM were slightly lower than those of hens that received treatment ST-FA or ST-IM. The cross-reactivity of anti-SE IgY, induced by treatment SE-FA or SE-IM, with ST-OMP antigen and that of anti-ST IgY, induced by ST-FA or ST-IM, with SE-OMP antigen were arbitrarily assessed on d 43 and 155 by ELISA. The average cross-reactivity of anti-SE IgY with ST-OMP antigen was 71.7%. The average cross-reactivity of anti-ST IgY with SE-OMP antigen was 78.8%. In FA groups, antibody titers were found higher (P < 0.05) than those in IM groups. Furthermore, no extensive lesions or clinical abnormalities were detected in hens injected with FA. These findings showed the opportunity to raise IgY antibody against 2 Salmonella serovars in the same yolk and that FA was more efficient than IM in mediating antibody response.","Chalghoumi, R.; Théwis, A.; Portetelle, D.; Beckers, Y.",Poult Sci,50,1

Because of this compartmental separation, Brefeldin A treatment has been used to map the sub-Golgi locations of several Golgi enzymes including GM2 synthase. We previously proposed that GM2 synthase might be located in a distal portion of the Golgi complex which in the presence of Brefeldin A would be separated from the substrate ganglioside GM3 present in the mixed ER-Golgi membrane system. In the present study we show using GM2 synthase chimeras that GM2 synthesis was blocked by Brefeldin A when GM2 synthase was distributed throughout all Golgi subcompartments or even when it was restricted to the medial Golgi. Because these findings opposed our speculation regarding a distal location of this enzyme, we sought an alternative explanation for the inhibition of ganglioside synthesis by Brefeldin A. However, Brefeldin A did not degrade GM2 synthase, prevent its homodimerization, or inhibit its in vitro activity. Brefeldin A did result in the conversion of a portion of membrane bound GM2 synthase into a soluble form which has minimal capability to produce GM2 in whole cells. However, this conversion was not sufficient to explain the nearly total loss of GM2 production in intact cells in the presence of Brefeldin A. Nevertheless, the results of this study indicate that Brefeldin A-induced inhibition of ganglioside synthesis cannot be used to deduce the location of GM2 synthase.","Young, William W.; Allende, Maria Laura; Jaskiewicz, Ewa",Glycobiology,50,11

We further demonstrated that BRD4 inhibition boosted a robust innate immune response. BRD4 inhibition also de-compacted chromatin structure and induced the DNA damage response, thereby triggering the activation of cGAS-mediated innate immunity and increasing host resistance to viral infection both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the inhibitory effect of BRD4 inhibition on viral infection was mainly attributed to the attenuation of viral attachment.

The plasma membrane-bound carboxypeptidase activity which occurs at neutral optimum pH levels was found to be enhanced by CoCl(2) and inhibited by guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid, o-phenanthroline, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and cadmium acetate; whereas the soluble carboxypeptidase activity which occurs at an optimum pH level of 5.0 was not activated by CoCl(2) and only slightly inhibited by o-phenanthroline, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, NiCl(2) and CdCl(2). The latter activity was presumably due to lysosomal cathepsin B, which is known to be present in the soluble fraction of hog intestinal mucosa. Although the membrane-bound enzyme was evenly distributed along the small intestine, it was not anchored in the phospholipidic bilayer via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol moiety, as carboxypeptidase M from human placenta is. The enzyme was not solubilized by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, but was solubilized to practically the same extent by several detergents. The purified trypsin-solubilized form is a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 200 kDa, as determined by performing SDS–PAGE and gel filtration, which differs considerably from the molecular mass of human placental carboxypeptidase M (62 kDa). It was found to cleave lysyl bonds more rapidly than arginyl bonds, which is not so in the case of carboxypeptidase M, and immunoblotting analysis provided further evidence that hog intestinal and human placental membrane-bound carboxypeptidases do not bear much resemblance to each other.

Prelicensing data evaluation procedures are designed to assess the quality of each product and support product label claims. Under the standard licensing process, this spectrum of evaluation includes complete characterization of seed material and ingredients, and laboratory- and host-animal safety and efficacy studies. Post-license testing includes batch tests for purity, safety, and potency. As part of the production and testing of regulated products, procedures involving animals are used to validate product requirements for safety, potency, and efficacy. Incorporating alternative methods to reduce, refine, and replace the use of animals in the development and testing of veterinary biological products has been a strategic goal for the CVB for several decades, and current licensing processes and policies are designed to support and encourage the shift from animal-based methods to alternative practices while ensuring that regulated products continue to be safe and effective.","Hill, Richard E.",Procedia Vaccinol,50,8

Full length POMC was mutated by deleting amino acids 2–26 from the N-terminal region. Analysis of Neuro-2a cells expressing this mutation compared to wild type POMC indicated that these 26 amino acids contain information essential for sorting POMC to the regulated secretory pathway.

This high sedimentation coefficient allowed its further separation from M1 and M2. Using electron microscopy of negatively stained samples, we studied the morphology of G on virus and after detergent extraction. End-on views of G on virus clearly showed triangles consisting of three dots indicating the trimeric nature of native G. End-on views of CHAPS-isolated G showed very similar triangles confirming that, using this detergent, G was solubilized in its native trimeric structure.

In fact, most basic principles of these processes were first described in viral systems. Furthermore, viruses seem not to respect basic rules, and cases of “abnormal” expression strategies are quiet common, although such strategies are usually also finally observed in rare cases of cellular gene expression. Concerning translation, viruses most often violate Kozak's original rule that eukaryotic translation starts from a capped monocistronic mRNA and involves linear scanning to find the first suitable start codon. Thus, many viral cases have been described where translation is initiated from noncapped RNA, using an internal ribosome entry site. This review centers on other viral translation strategies, namely shunting and virus-controlled reinitiation as first described in plant pararetroviruses (Caulimoviridae). In shunting, major parts of a complex leader are bypassed and not melted by scanning ribosomes. In the Caulimoviridae, this process is coupled to reinitiation after translation of a small open reading frame; in other cases, it is possibly initiated upon pausing of the scanning ribosome. Most of the Caulimoviridae produce polycistronic mRNAs. Two basic mechanisms are used for their translation. Alternative translation of the downstream open reading frames in the bacilliform Caulimoviridae occurs by a leaky scanning mechanism, and reinitiation of polycistronic translation in many of the icosahedral Caulimoviridae is enabled by the action of a viral transactivator. Both of these processes are discussed here in detail and compared to related processes in other viruses and cells.","Ryabova, Lyubov A; Pooggin, Mikhail M; Hohn, Thomas",Prog Nucleic Acid Res Mol Biol,50,1

The POLI-IF (Newcastle virus plus endotoxin of E. coli and Freund's incomplete adjuvant) rapidly induces the aspecific immunity. Given twice with 7–10 days interval in between, on occasion of a programmed stress (weaning, transport, crowding) it proved its efficacy in artificially suckled calves and in weaning piglets. The field trials, carried out on 2,782 treated calves in comparison with 2,909 untreated controls and on 4,387 piglets in comparison with 4,461 untreated controls, revealed statistically significant differences for P < 0.005 among the groups of treated and control animals. The immunostimulator reduced the incidence of the disease, dead and discarded animals, as well as it shortened the mean duration of the disease in single heads. Though the way the POLI-IF acts is not perfectly known so far, yet it increases the serum bactericidal activity and the circulating leukocytes, while it induces high levels of IFN. In our opinion the activity of the POLI-IF is bound to 3 factors at least: activation of the complementary fractions, mobilization of the immunocompetent cells, induction of IFN.","Galassi, D.; Galassi, P.; Pelliccioni, A.; Semprini, Primula",Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,50,1

Five PRV strains were used to infect AM including strains that are known to be highly virulent for pigs, i.e. strain 4892 and strain S-62 as well as strains that are regarded as mild or nonvirulent, i.e. BUK and Bartha. The multiplicity of infection ranged from 0.005 to 0.05 TCID(50)/cell. The target cells in the cytotoxicity assays were either chicken red blood cells, PRV-infected vero cells, or human myeloblastoma cells (K562 cell line). For the producton of IFN, AM cultures were treated with polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) diluted in tissue culture media at a concentration of 5 μg/10(6) cells. Culture supernatants were collected at various times poststimulation and tested for antiviral activity using the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus replication inhibition test. Swine AM were able to lyse chicken red blood cells in an antibody-independent way but not in an antibody-dependent way, whereas lysis of PRV-infected vero cells was accomplished both ways. The cytotoxicity against chicken red blood cells was reduced in the PRV-infected AM as compared to noninfected cells, particularly in AM infected with virulent PRV strains. Specific (51)Cr release values for AM infected with S-62 and 4892 strains were 14 and 19, while the noninfected AM had values of 36. Similarly, in the antibody-dependent cytotoxicity assay against PRV-infected vero cells there was no activity of AM against K562 cells. The production of IFN was readily stimulated with Poly I:C. The optimal time for supernatant collection was between 12 and 16h poststimulation. The antiviral activity was abrogated by treatment of the supernatant with antiserum against human leukocyte IFN; it was therefore considered to be due to interferon-alpha (IFNα) released from the macrophages. The antiviral activity present in supernatants of PRV-infected AM was reduced compared to noninfected AM. The difference between AM cultures infected with virulent strains of PRV and noninfected AM cultures was statistically significant at P ⩽ 0.025. The results provide support to the premise that the role of AM in lung defense can be compromised by PRV infection.","Iglesias, Gerardo; Pijoan, Carlos; Molitor, Thomas",Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,50,8

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1980 and 1993, 326 patients referred to our department with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL, n=182) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n=144) in complete remission underwent TBI either in single dose (190 patients: 10 Gy administered to the midplane, and 8 Gy to the lungs [STBI]) or in 6 fractions (136 patients: 12 Gy on 3 consecutive days, and 9 Gy to the lungs [FTBI]) before BMT. The male-to-female ratio was 204/122 (1.67), and the median age was 30 years (mean: 30 ± 11, range: 3 to 63). The patients were analyzed according to 3 instantaneous dose rate groups: 118 patients in the LOW group (≤0.048 Gy/min), 188 in the MEDIUM group (> 0.048 and ≤ 0.09 Gy/min), and 20 in the HIGH group (> 0.09 cGy/min). Conditioning chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide (CY) alone in 250 patients, CY and other drugs in 54, and 22 patients were conditioned using combinations without CY. Following TBI, allogeneic and autologous BMT were realized respectively in 118 and 208 patients. Median follow-up period was 68 months (mean: 67 ± 29, range: 24 to 130 months). RESULTS: Five-year survival, LFS, RI and TRM rates were 42%, 40%, 47%, and 24%, respectively. Five-year LFS was 36% in the STBI and 45% in the FTBI group (p = 0.17). It was 36% in the LOW group, 42% in the MEDIUM group, and 30% in the HIGH group (p > 0.05). Five-year RI was 50% in STBI, 43% in FTBI, 55% in LOW, 41% in MEDIUM, and 44% in HIGH groups (STBI vs. FTBI, p = 0.48; LOW vs. MEDIUM, p = 0.03: MEDIUM vs. HIGH, p = 0.68). TRM was not influenced significantly by the different TBI techniques. When analyzing separately the influence of fractionation and the instantaneous dose rate either in ANLL or ALL patients, no difference in terms of survival and LFS was observed. Fractionation did not influence the 5-year RI both in ANLL and ALL patients. However, among the patients with ANLL, 5-year RI was significantly higher (58%) in the LOW group than the MEDIUM group (31%, p = 0.001), whereas instantaneous dose rate did not significantly influence the RI in ALL patients. The 5-year TRM rate was significantly higher in allogeneic BMT group both in ANLL (37%) and ALL (37%) patients than those treated by autologous BMT (ANLL: 15%, ALL: 18%: p = 0.002 and 0.02, respectively). The 5-year estimated interstitial pneumonitis (IP) and cataract incidence rates were 22% and 19%, respectively, in all patients. IP incidence seemed to be higher in the HIGH group (46%) than the MEDIUM (19%, p = 0.05) or LOW (25%, p = 0.15) groups. Furthermore, cataract incidence was significantly influenced by fractionation (STBI vs. FTBI, 29% vs. 9%; p = 0.003) and instantaneous dose rate (LOW vs. MEDIUM vs. HIGH, 0% vs. 27% vs. 33%; p < 0.0001). Multivariate analyses revealed that the best factors influencing the survival were 1st CR (p = 0.0007), age ≤ 40 years (p = 0.003), and BMT after 1985 (p = 0.008). The RI was influenced independently only by the remission status (p = 0.0002). On the other hand, the TRM rate was lower in patients who did not experience graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD, p < 0.0001), and in those treated after 1985 (p = 0.0005). GvHD was the only independent factor involved in the development of IP (p = 0.01). When considering the cataract incidence, the only independent factor was the instantaneous dose rate (p = 0.0008). CONCLUSION: The outcome of BMT patients conditioned with TBI for acute leukemia was not significantly influenced by the TBI technique, and TRM seemed to be lower in patients treated after 1985. On the other hand, cataract incidence was significantly influenced by the instantaneous dose rate.","Belkacémi, Y.; Pène, F.; Touboul, E.; Rio, B.; Leblond, V.; Gorin, N.

As these are not detected by traditional meat inspection, a meat safety assurance system using risk‐based interventions was proposed. Further studies are required on T. gondii and pathogenic VTEC. If new information confirms these hazards as a high risk to public health from meat from sheep or goats, setting targets at carcass level should be considered. Other elements of the system are risk‐categorisation of flocks/herds based on improved Food Chain Information (FCI), classification of abattoirs according to their capability to reduce faecal contamination, and use of improved process hygiene criteria. It is proposed to omit palpation and incision from post‐mortem inspection in animals subjected to routine slaughter. For chemical hazards, dioxins and dioxin‐like polychlorinated biphenyls were ranked as being of high potential concern. Monitoring programmes for chemical hazards should be more flexible and based on the risk of occurrence, taking into account FCI, which should be expanded to reflect the extensive production systems used, and the ranking of chemical substances, which should be regularly updated and include new hazards. Control programmes across the food chain, national residue control plans, feed control and monitoring of environmental contaminants should be better integrated. Meat inspection is a valuable tool for surveillance and monitoring of animal health and welfare conditions. Omission of palpation and incision would reduce detection effectiveness for tuberculosis and fasciolosis at animal level. Surveillance of tuberculosis at the slaughterhouse in small ruminants should be improved and encouraged, as this is in practice the only surveillance system available. Extended use of FCI could compensate for some, but not all, the information on animal health and welfare lost if only visual post‐mortem inspection is applied.",,EFSA J,50,5

The highest dose would have been expected to protect against experimental colds. Treatment was discontinued because of upper respiratory symptoms as often in each of the interferon groups as in the placebo group. However, it was possible to distinguish clinically between “colds” on placebo and low‐dose interferon and “reactions to treatment” on high‐dose interferon. The features of the reactions to treatment were a protracted build‐up of local symptoms and minor epistaxis. None of the volunteers on the high‐dose interferon were thought to have a definite cold, but viruses were isolated from four out of six volunteers on low‐dose interferon who had definite colds. Previous experiments had also shown this dose to be insufficient to protect against experimental rhinovirus challenge. The dose of interferon that appeared to protect against virus infection caused significant unwanted effects. It is essential to find interferon preparations with less inflammatory activity before interferon can be considered for use as a long‐term prophylactic against the common cold.","Scott, G.

METHODS: This study compared stool microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) of 37 term infants with CGISCs with 36 term healthy infants (HIs). Two stool samples were collected from each infant: as soon as possible after birth (week 1) and 10–14 days of life (week 2). RESULTS: Bacterial richness and alpha diversity were comparable between CGISCs and HIs at week 1 and week 2 (all p > 0.05). Beta diversity analysis revealed that at week 1, CGISCs had similar community structures to HIs (p = 0.415). However, by week 2, community structures of CGISCs were significantly different from HIs (p = 0.003). At week 1, there were no significant differences in the relative abundances of genera Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides between CGISCs and HIs. At week 2, the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium was significantly lower in CGISCs (mean percentage 7.21 ± 13.49 vs. 28.96 ± 19.6; p = 0.002). Bacteroides were also less abundant in the CGISC group (mean percentage 0.12 ± 0.49 vs. 6.59 ± 8.62; p = 0.039). Relative abundance of genera Pseudomonas and Escherichia–Shigella were higher in CGISCs. At week 2, stool concentrations of all SCFAs were lower in CGISCs (all p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: During hospitalization, neonates with CGISCs develop gut dysbiosis and deficiency of SCFAs. IMPACT: During hospitalisation, neonates with congenital gastrointestinal surgical conditions develop gut dysbiosis with deficiency of Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides and increased abundance of Escherichia-Shigella and Pseudomonas. They also have low levels of short chain fatty acids in their stools compared to healthy infants. This is the first study evaluating the gut microbiota using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing methods and stool short chain fatty acids in neonates with congenital gastrointestinal surgical conditions and comparing them to healthy infants. The findings of this study will pave the way for randomised trials of bifidobacterial supplementation in neonates with congenital gastrointestinal surgical conditions.","Rao, Shripada C.; Esvaran, Meera; Patole, Sanjay K.; Simmer, Karen N.; Gollow, Ian; Keil, Anthony; Wemheuer, Bernd; Chen, Liwei; Conway, Patricia L.",Pediatr Res,50,28

The causal agent is a negative-strand RNA virus 80–100 nm in diameter. It causes fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, gastrointestinal symptoms, and neural symptoms. The mortality rate of SFTS was 32.6% among 172 cases reported from 2012 to 2015 in South Korea. Thus, is necessary to develop an effective diagnostic method that selectively identifies the isolates circulating in South Korea. The real-time reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay is a simple, rapid, and sensitive approach for molecular diagnosis. Here, we designed novel primers for this assay and found that the technique had very high specificity, sensitivity, and efficiency. This real-time RT-LAMP approach using the novel primers developed herein can be applied for early diagnosis of SFTSV strains in South Korea to reduce the mortality rate of SFTS.","Lee, Jae Woong; Won, Yu-Jung; Kang, Lae Hyung; Lee, Sung-Geun; Park, Seung-Won; Paik, Soon-Young",J Microbiol,50,8

To translate this resulting state into a causal relationship with a subset of regulatory features, many experiments deploy an array of laboratory assays from multiple modalities. Often, each of these resulting datasets is large, heterogeneous, and noisy. Thus, it is non-trivial to unify these complex datasets into an interpretable phenotype. Although recent methods address this problem with varying degrees of success, they are constrained by their scopes or limitations. Therefore, an important gap in the field is the lack of a universal data harmonizer with the capability to arbitrarily integrate multi-modal datasets. RESULTS: In this review, we perform a critical analysis of methods with the explicit aim of harmonizing data, as opposed to case-specific integration. This revealed that matrix factorization, latent variable analysis, and deep learning are potent strategies. Finally, we describe the properties of an ideal universal data harmonization framework. CONCLUSIONS: A sufficiently advanced universal harmonizer has major medical implications, such as (i) identifying dysregulated biological pathways responsible for a disease is a powerful diagnostic tool; (2) investigating these pathways further allows the biological community to better understand a disease’s mechanisms; and (3) precision medicine also benefits from developments in this area, particularly in the context of the growing field of selective epigenome editing, which can suppress or induce a desired phenotype.","Chen, Tyrone; Tyagi, Sonika",Gigascience,50,1

Aging is also a reason for corneal degeneration. Depending on the level of the injury, conservative therapies and donor tissue transplantation are the most common treatments for corneal diseases. Not only is there a lack of donor tissue and risk of infection/rejection, but the inherent ability of corneal cells and layers to regenerate has led to research in regenerative approaches and treatments. METHODS: In this review, we first discussed the anatomy of the cornea and the required properties for reconstructing layers of the cornea. Regenerative approaches are divided into two main categories; using direct cell/growth factor delivery or using scaffold-based cell delivery. It is expected delivered cells migrate and integrate into the host tissue and restore its structure and function to restore vision. Growth factor delivery also has shown promising results for corneal surface regeneration. Scaffold-based approaches are categorized based on the type of scaffold, since it has a significant impact on the efficiency of regeneration, into the hydrogel and non-hydrogel based scaffolds. Various types of cells, biomaterials, and techniques are well covered. RESULTS: The most important characteristics to be considered for biomaterials in corneal regeneration are suitable mechanical properties, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and transparency. Moreover, a curved shape structure and spatial arrangement of the fibrils have been shown to mimic the corneal extracellular matrix for cells and enhance cell differentiation. CONCLUSION: Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine approaches showed to have promising outcomes for corneal regeneration. However, besides proper mechanical and optical properties, other factors such as appropriate sterilization method, storage, shelf life and etc. should be taken into account in order to develop an engineered cornea for clinical trials.

However, potential issues regarding the phenotypic stability and reproducibility of the methodology during culture still needs to be addressed for different organoids. Here we investigated the transcriptomes of jejunum organoids derived from the same pig as well as batch-to-batch variation of organoids derived from different pigs over long-term passage. The set of genes expressed in organoids closely resembled that of the tissue of origin, including small intestine specific genes, for at least 17 passages. Minor differences in gene expression were observed between individual organoid cultures. In contrast, most small intestine-specific genes were not expressed in the jejunum cell line IPEC-J2, which also showed gene expression consistent with cancer phenotypes. We conclude that intestinal organoids provide a robust and stable model for translational research with clear advantages over transformed cells.","van der Hee, Bart; Madsen, Ole; Vervoort, Jacques; Smidt, Hauke; Wells, Jerry M.",Front Cell Dev Biol,50,1

Characterizing the consistency and temporal responses of the gut microbiome to glycans is critical for rationally developing and deploying these compounds as therapeutics. METHODS: We investigated the effect of two chemically distinct glycans (fructooligosaccharides and polydextrose) through three clinical studies conducted with 80 healthy volunteers. Stool samples, collected at dense temporal resolution (~ 4 times per week over 10 weeks) and analyzed using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, enabled detailed characterization of participants’ microbiomes. For analyzing the microbiome time-series data, we developed MC-TIMME2 (Microbial Counts Trajectories Infinite Mixture Model Engine 2.0), a purpose-built computational tool based on nonparametric Bayesian methods that infer temporal patterns induced by perturbations and groups of microbes sharing these patterns. RESULTS: Overall microbiome structure as well as individual taxa showed rapid, consistent, and durable alterations across participants, regardless of compound dose or the order in which glycans were consumed. Significant changes also occurred in the abundances of microbial carbohydrate utilization genes in response to polydextrose, but not in response to fructooligosaccharides. Using MC-TIMME2, we produced detailed, high-resolution temporal maps of the microbiota in response to glycans within and across microbiomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that dietary glycans cause reproducible, dynamic, and differential alterations to the community structure of the human microbiome.","Creswell, Richard; Tan, Jie; Leff, Jonathan W.; Brooks, Brandon; Mahowald, Michael A.; Thieroff-Ekerdt, Ruth; Gerber, Georg K.",Genome Med,50,1

DESIGN: MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, Web of science, and PEDro were searched from their earliest record to August 1, 2019. All randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized controlled trial were identified, which compared the efficacy of neuromuscular electrical stimulation plus traditional therapy with traditional therapy in swallowing function. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was applied to evaluate the quality of evidence. RESULTS: Eight randomized controlled trials and three quasi-randomized controlled trials were included. These studies demonstrated a significant, moderate pooled effect size (standard mean difference = 0.62; 95% confidence interval = 0.06 to 1.17). Studies stimulating suprahyoid muscle groups revealed a negative standard mean difference of 0.17 (95% confidence interval = −0.42, 0.08), whereas large effect size was observed in studies stimulating the infrahyoid muscle groups (standard mean difference = 0.89; 95% confidence interval = 0.47 to 1.30) and stimulating the suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscle groups (standard mean difference = 1.4; 95% confidence interval = 1.07 to 1.74). Stimulation lasting 45 mins or less showed a large, significant pooled effect size (standard mean difference = 0.89; 95% confidence interval = 0.58 to 1.20). The quality of evidences was rated as low to very low. CONCLUSIONS: There is no firm evidence to conclude on the efficacy of neuromuscular electrical stimulation on swallowing disorders.

Preclinical investigations in animals and retrospective studies in patients have suggested that inhibition of platelets may improve the outcome of sepsis. In this study we investigated whether chronic antiplatelet therapy impacts on the presentation and outcome of sepsis, and the host response. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study in 972 patients admitted with sepsis to the mixed intensive care units (ICUs) of two hospitals in the Netherlands between January 2011 and July 2013. Of them, 267 patients (27.5 %) were on antiplatelet therapy (95.9 % acetylsalicylic acid) before admission. To account for differential likelihoods of receiving antiplatelet therapy, a propensity score was constructed, including variables associated with use of antiplatelet therapy. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the association of antiplatelet therapy with mortality. RESULTS: Antiplatelet therapy was not associated with sepsis severity at presentation, the primary source of infection, causative pathogens, the development of organ failure or shock during ICU stay, or mortality up to 90 days after admission, in either unmatched or propensity-matched analyses. Antiplatelet therapy did not modify the values of 19 biomarkers providing insight into hallmark host responses to sepsis, including activation of the coagulation system, the vascular endothelium, the cytokine network, and renal function, during the first 4 days after ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-existing antiplatelet therapy is not associated with alterations in the presentation or outcome of sepsis, or the host response.

However, developmental data on blow fly eggs are mainly limited to records of the time to larval hatching. The current paper describes the morphological changes occurring during embryogenesis of the blow fly Calliphora vicina Robineau-Desvoidy and their timing in relation to temperature, in order to determine those characters which can be used for simple egg age estimation using light microscopy. At 7.3 and 25 °C, 15 easily visualised morphological landmarks were determined in C. vicina living embryos, allowing for their age estimation with a resolution of 10–20 % of total egg developmental time. The observed age intervals were compared to the embryonic stages described for the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster Meigen, which are used as reference data in multiple developmental studies. Moreover, current guidelines for preservation of egg samples, which recommend the placement of living eggs directly into 80 % ethanol, were tested against the hot water killing (HWK) method prior to preservation in 80 % ethanol, recommended for larval and pupal specimens. Direct placement of eggs into 80 % ethanol caused marked decomposition of samples, and no morphological landmarks were discernible. On the other hand, HWK fixation prior to preservation in 80 % ethanol enabled visualisation of 11 of the 15 age-specific morphological landmarks that were discernible in living embryos. Therefore, HWK fixation prior to preservation in 80 % ethanol is recommended for egg samples, thus unifying the protocols for collecting entomological evidence.","Martín-Vega, Daniel; Hall, Martin J.

Protecting young children from pandemic influenza should also reduce transmission to susceptible adults, including pregnant women. Methods. An open study assessed immunogenicity and reactogenicity of a heterologous booster dose of A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005(H5N1)-AS03(B) (AS03(B) is an Adjuvant System containing α-tocopherol and squalene in an oil-in-water emulsion [5.93 mg tocopherol]) in infants and children aged 6 to < 36 months that was given 6 months following 2-dose primary vaccination with A/Indonesia/05/2005(H5N1)-AS03(B). Vaccines contained 1.9 µg of hemagglutinin antigen and AS03(B). Hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) responses, microneutralization titers, and antineuraminidase antibody levels were assessed for 6 months following the booster vaccination. Results. For each age stratum (defined on the basis of the subject's age at first vaccination as 6 to < 12 months, 12 to < 24 months, and 24 to < 36 months) and overall (n = 113), European influenza vaccine licensure criteria were fulfilled for responses to A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005(H5N1) 10 days following the booster vaccination. Local pain and fever increased with consecutive doses. Anamnestic immune responses were demonstrated for HI, neutralizing, and antineuraminidase antibodies against vaccine-homologous/heterologous strains. Antibody responses to vaccine-homologous/heterologous strains persisted in all children 6 months following the booster vaccination. Conclusions. Prevaccination of young children with a clade 2 strain influenza A(H5N1) AS03-adjuvanted vaccine followed by heterologous booster vaccination boosted immune responses to the homologous strain and a related clade, with persistence for at least 6 months. The results support a prime-boost vaccination approach in young children for pandemic influenza preparedness. Clinical Trials Registration.

Some of them are only located in the parasellar region, whereas others can occur elsewhere, within or outside the central nervous system. Their spectrum ranges from histologically benign and low-grade malignant to high-grade malignant tumours. Although rare, metastases can pose differential diagnostic dilemmas. The severity of the clinical picture, the challenges of surgery and the risk of adverse sequelae related to surgery or radiotherapy make parasellar tumours interesting entities for the clinicians irrespective of their histological malignancy grade. Due to the different cell origins of parasellar tumours, the World Health Organization classification system does not categorise them as a distinct group. Detailed criteria for classification and malignancy grading are presented in the classification systems covering central nervous system tumours, haematological malignancies and tumours of the soft tissue and bone. In the last few years, molecular genetic features have been integrated into the diagnosis of several types of the parasellar tumours enhancing diagnostic accuracy and providing information of the value for targeting therapies. In this review, we will present histopathological and molecular genetic features, updated classification criteria and recent advances in the diagnostics and rationale for novel pharmacological therapies of selected types of parasellar neoplasms.","Manojlovic-Gacic, Emilija; Rostami, Elham; Karavitaki, Niki; Casar-Borota, Olivera",Neuroendocrinology,50,1

We found several reported SNPs, genetic mutations, and upregulation of messenger RNAs that directly or indirectly increase the propensity for postoperative adhesion development, namely in genes for transforming growth factor beta, vascular endothelial growth factor, interferon-gamma, matrix metalloproteinase, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and the interleukins. An understanding of genetic variants could provide insight into the pathophysiology of adhesion development. The information presented in this review contributes to a greater understanding of adhesion development at the genetic level and may allow modification of these genetic risks, which may subsequently guide management in preventing and treating this challenging complication of abdominal surgery. In particular, the information could help identify patients at greater risk for adhesion development, which would make them candidates for anti-adhesion prophylaxis. Currently, agents to reduce postoperative adhesion development exist, and in the future, development of agents, which specifically target individual genetic profile, would be more specific in preventing intraperitoneal adhesion development.","Thakur, Mili; Rambhatla, Anupama; Qadri, Farnoosh; Chatzicharalampous, Charalampos; Awonuga, Modupe; Saed, Ghassan; Diamond, Michael P.; Awonuga, Awoniyi O.",Reprod Sci,50,1

This research focuses on the human-in-the-loop-system named Healthcare Professionals in the Loop (HPIL) to support diagnosis through an advanced machine learning procedure. HPIL is a novel system approach based on the textural pattern of OML and OPMDs (anomalous regions) to differentiate them from standard regions of the oral cavity by using autofluorescence imaging. An innovative method based on pre-processing, e.g., the Deriche–Canny edge detector and circular Hough transform (CHT); a post-processing textural analysis approach using the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM); and a feature selection algorithm (linear discriminant analysis (LDA)), followed by k-nearest neighbor (KNN) to classify OPMDs and the standard region, is proposed in this paper. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in differentiating between standard and anomalous regions of the oral cavity are 83%, 85%, and 84%, respectively. The performance evaluation was plotted through the receiver operating characteristics of periodontist diagnosis with the HPIL system and without the system. This method of classifying OML and OPMD areas may help the dental specialist to identify anomalous regions for performing their biopsies more efficiently to predict the histological diagnosis of epithelial dysplasia.","Awais, Muhammad; Ghayvat, Hemant; Krishnan Pandarathodiyil, Anitha; Nabillah Ghani, Wan Maria; Ramanathan, Anand; Pandya, Sharnil; Walter, Nicolas; Saad, Mohamad Naufal; Zain, Rosnah Binti; Faye, Ibrahima",Sensors (Basel),50,1

Malaria images can be employed to identify and detect malaria using these methods, in order to monitor the symptoms of malaria patients, although there may be atypical cases that need more time for an assessment. This research used 7000 images of Xception, Inception-V3, ResNet-50, NasNetMobile, VGG-16 and AlexNet models for verification and analysis. These are prevalent models that classify the image precision and use a rotational method to improve the performance of validation and the training dataset with convolutional neural network models. Xception, using the state of the art activation function (Mish) and optimizer (Nadam), improved the effectiveness, as found by the outcomes of the convolutional neural model evaluation of these models for classifying the malaria disease from thin blood smear images. In terms of the performance, recall, accuracy, precision, and F1 measure, a combined score of 99.28% was achieved. Consequently, 10% of all non-dataset training and testing images were evaluated utilizing this pattern. Notable aspects for the improvement of a computer-aided diagnostic to produce an optimum malaria detection approach have been found, supported by a 98.86% accuracy level.","Sriporn, Krit; Tsai, Cheng-Fa; Tsai, Chia-En; Wang, Paohsi",Diagnostics (Basel),50,28

MALP-2 has been described to exert beneficial effects on organ damage and the further course after isolated trauma and sepsis. However, the impact of MALP-2 on a clinically realistic two-hit scenario of trauma and subsequent sepsis remains unknown. We, therefore, investigated if the systemic inflammatory response and pulmonary immune response and damage are beneficially modulated by MALP-2 in a murine two-hit model. Blood pressure-controlled trauma-hemorrhage (TH) and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) were induced in C57/BL6 mice. Mice were divided into 2 control groups (control 1: TH without CLP; control 2: TH and CLP) and 3 experimental groups treated with MALP-2 at different time points (ETH, end of TH; ECLP, end of CLP; and 6CLP 6 h after CLP). Survival rates were assessed over the observation period of 168 h after the induction of TH. Concentrations of plasma inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (TNF-α, IL-6, MIP-1α, IFN-γ, and IL-10) were assessed, and bacterial clearance of the lungs was determined. Furthermore, pulmonary MPO activity assay to evaluate the infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and histological evaluation were performed. Survival rates were evaluated. Compared with control group 1, the level of TNF-α in the ECLP group showed a significant increase (ECLP, 2.27 pg./ml ± 1.39 vs. control 1: 0.16 pg./ml ± 0.11, p = 0.021). In contrast, levels of IFN-γ were significantly reduced in groups ETH and 6CLP compared with control group 1 (control 1: 8.92 pg./ml ± 4.38 vs. ETH: 1.77 pg./ml ± 4.34, p = 0.026 resp. vs. 6CLP: 1.83 pg./ml ± 4.49, p = 0.014). While systemic concentrations of inflammatory mediators were not affected by MALP-2 treatment, the lung tissue presented with significant alterations. Reduced MPO activity was lowest in group ECLP (ECLP 11,196.77 ± 547.81 vs. ETH 12,773.94 ± 1011.76; p = 0.023 resp. vs. 6CLP 13,155.19 ± 423.99, p = 0.016) in experimental groups. Also, histological damage after MALP-2 application was lowest in ECLP animals (ECLP 0.50 ± 0.08 vs. ETH 0.71 ± 0.05, p = 0.034 resp. vs. 6CLP 0.64 ± 0.08, p = 0.021). Furthermore, MALP-2 treatment was associated with a trend towards improved survival in the ECLP group (ECLP 83.3% vs. ETH 66.7 and 6CLP 58.3%, p > 0.05). Based on our results, MALP-2 might have beneficial effects on the clinical course after hemorrhage and sepsis by reducing pulmonary damage and PMN infiltration. This might also affect survival. According to our data, MALP-2 should be given at the earliest possible time point after the onset of sepsis. However, the optimal dosage and confirmation of our results in larger cohorts need to be the focus of further research.","Xu, Ding; Horst, Klemens; Wang, Weikang; Luo, Peng; Shi, Yulong; Tschernig, Thomas; Greven, Johannes; Hildebrand, Frank",Inflammation,50,1

The human Notch family comprises of four receptors (Notch 1 to 4) and five ligands. Their signaling can regulate extremely basic cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation and death. Notch is also involved in hematopoiesis and angiogenesis, and increasing evidence suggests that these genes are involved and frequently deregulated in several human malignancies, contributing to cell autonomous activities that may be either oncogenic or tumor suppressive. It was recently proposed that Notch signaling could play an active role in promoting and sustaining a broad spectrum of lymphoid malignancies as well as mutations in Notch family members that are present in several disorders of T- and B-cells, which could be responsible for altering the related signaling. Therefore, different Notch pathway molecules could be considered as potential therapeutic targets for hematological cancers. In this review, we will summarize and discuss compelling evidence pointing to Notch receptors as pleiotropic regulators of hematologic malignancies biology, first describing the physiological role of their signaling in T- and B-cell development and homeostasis, in order to fully understand the pathological alterations reported.","Gragnani, Laura; Lorini, Serena; Marri, Silvia; Zignego, Anna Linda",Cells,50,28

A popular model in continuous phylogeography—with location data provided in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates—describes spread as a Brownian motion (Brownian Motion Phylogeography, BMP) in continuous space and time, akin to similar models of continuous trait evolution. Here, we show that reconstructions using this model can be strongly affected by sampling biases, such as the lack of sampling from certain areas. As an attempt to reduce the effects of sampling bias on BMP, we consider the addition of sequence-free samples from under-sampled areas. While this approach alleviates the effects of sampling bias, in most scenarios this will not be a viable option due to the need for prior knowledge of an outbreak’s spatial distribution. We therefore consider an alternative model, the spatial Λ-Fleming-Viot process (ΛFV), which has recently gained popularity in population genetics. Despite the ΛFV’s robustness to sampling biases, we find that the different assumptions of the ΛFV and BMP models result in different applicabilities, with the ΛFV being more appropriate for scenarios of endemic spread, and BMP being more appropriate for recent outbreaks or colonizations.","Kalkauskas, Antanas; Perron, Umberto; Sun, Yuxuan; Goldman, Nick; Baele, Guy; Guindon, Stephane; De Maio, Nicola",PLoS Comput Biol,50,17

In this study, the Ag85B antigen from MAP was expressed in transgenic alfalfa as an attractive vaccine candidate. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation allowed the rescue of 56 putative transformed plants and transgenesis was confirmed in 19 lines by detection of the Ag85B gene (MAP1609c) by PCR. Line number 20 showed the highest Ag85B expression [840 ng Ag85B per gram of dry weight leaf tissue, 0.062% Total Soluble Protein (TSP)]. Antigenicity of the plant-made Ag85B was evidenced by its reactivity with a panel of sera from naturally MAP-infected animals, whereas immunogenicity was assessed in mice immunized by either oral or subcutaneous routes. The plant-made Ag85B antigen elicited humoral responses by the oral route when co-administered with cholera toxin as adjuvant; significant levels of anti-85B antibodies were induced in serum (IgG) and feces (IgA). Long-lasting immunity was evidenced at day 180 days post-first oral immunization. The obtained alfalfa lines expressing Ag85B constitute the first model of a plant-based vaccine targeting MAP. The initial immunogenicity assessment conducted in this study opens the path for a detailed characterization of the properties of this vaccine candidate.

While diverse quantitative glycoproteomics strategies capable of mapping monosaccharide compositions of N- and O-linked glycans to discrete sites of proteins within complex biological mixtures with considerable sensitivity, quantitative accuracy and coverage have become available, developments supporting the advancement of structure-focused glycoproteomics, a recognised frontier in the field, have emerged. Technologies capable of providing site-specific information of the glycan fine structures in a glycoproteome-wide context are indeed necessary to address many pending questions in glycobiology. In this review, we firstly survey the latest glycoproteomics studies published in 2018–2020, their approaches and their findings, and then summarise important technological innovations in structure-focused glycoproteomics. Our review illustrates that while the O-glycoproteome remains comparably under-explored despite the emergence of new O-glycan-selective mucinases and other innovative tools aiding O-glycoproteome profiling, quantitative glycoproteomics is increasingly used to profile the N-glycoproteome to tackle diverse biological questions. Excitingly, new strategies compatible with structure-focused glycoproteomics including novel chemoenzymatic labelling, enrichment, separation, and mass spectrometry-based detection methods are rapidly emerging revealing glycan fine structural details including bisecting GlcNAcylation, core and antenna fucosylation, and sialyl-linkage information with protein site resolution. Glycoproteomics has clearly become a mainstay within the glycosciences that continues to reach a broader community. It transpires that structure-focused glycoproteomics holds a considerable potential to aid our understanding of systems glycobiology and unlock secrets of the glycoproteome in the immediate future.","Chernykh, Anastasia; Kawahara, Rebeca; Thaysen-Andersen, Morten",Biochem Soc Trans,50,1

IL-35 mediates immunological functions and plays a protective role in several diseases such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. However, the role of IL-35 in gingivitis and periodontitis remains unclear. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature and collecting the available evidence regarding the role of IL-35 in pathogenesis of periodontal disease. METHODS: A systematic search of electronic databases including MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus was conducted in November 2020 to identify studies addressing the Interleukin-35 pathobiology in periodontal disease. The identified studies were subjected to pre-identified inclusion criteria. The retrived papers were assessed by the authours independently and consensus was reached in cases where disagreement occurred. Articles written in languages other than English, case reports, letters to editors, conference abstracts, theses, and dissertations were excluded from the review. RESULTS: A total of 176 possibly relevant articles were identified through the search strategy. Finally, 15 papers which met the criteria of eligibility were included in this review by consensus. The included articles were classified based on their design and level of evidence.Three subclinical study, ten cross sectional investigation and two randomized clinical trials constituted the final set of studies in this review. At preclinical level, Il-35 showed inhibitory characteristics regarding alveolar bone resorption of animal periodontitis models. The results of observatory human studies confirmed the presence of high levels of IL-35 in saliva, GCF, serum, and gingival biopsies of patients suffering from inflammatory periodontal disease. Moreover, two included clinical trials showed that non-surgical periodontal therapy could downregulate IL-35 production in chronic periodontitis patients. CONCLUSION: Interleukin-35 has an undeniable role in pathobiology of inflammatory periodontal disease. Further well-controlled studies are needed to better elucidate the functional pattern of IL-35 in pathogeneisis of gingival and periodontal disease.

Bivariate analysis was used to evaluate the significance of different indicators. Overall, 312 HCWs participated in this study. Regarding transfer to ICUs, the most frequently reported complications were deterioration in respiratory status (51.4%), followed by deterioration in hemodynamic status (46.5%), and missing clinical information (35.5%). Regarding transfers from ICUs to the general ward, the most commonly reported complications were changes in respiratory status (55.6%), followed by incomplete clinical information (37.9%), and change in hemodynamic conditions (29%).

Moreover, these individual and produced frames may influence the ways in which people see social robots as legitimate and trustworthy agents—especially in the face of (im)moral behavior. This three-study investigation begins to address this knowledge gap by 1) identifying individually held frames for explaining an android’s (im)moral behavior, and experimentally testing how produced frames prime judgments about an android’s morally ambiguous behavior in 2) mediated representations and 3) face-to-face exposures. Results indicate that people rely on discernible ground rules to explain social robot behaviors; these frames induced only limited effects on responsibility judgments of that robot’s morally ambiguous behavior. Evidence also suggests that technophobia-induced reactance may move people to reject a produced frame in favor of a divergent individual frame.","Banks, Jaime; Koban, Kevin",Front Robot AI,50,19

Evidence suggests that the global dietary patterns may represent a tool in counteracting oxidative stress, thus preventing the onset of diseases related to oxidative stress. More specifically, dietary patterns based on the regular consumption of fruits and vegetables (i.e., Mediterranean diet) have been licensed by various national nutritional guidelines in many countries for their health-promoting effects. Such patterns, indeed, result in being rich in specific components, such as fiber, minerals, vitamins and antioxidants, whose beneficial effects on human health have been widely reported. This suggests a potential nutraceutical power of specific dietary components.

This situation arises the mental abnormalities, sudden rise in body temperature, disturbance of consciousness, and so forth in children, which can be life-threatening. OBJECTIVE: This work aimed at exploring the effect of diffusion weighted MRI on children with severe viral encephalitis and myocarditis. METHODS: This work presents a diffusion weighted MRI scanning method that involves scanning through a serial imaging device, axial scanning, and sagittal and coronal scanning. 60 children with severe viral encephalitis and myocarditis who admitted to Brain Hospital of Hunan Province from April 2017 to May 2020 were deemed as research subjects. All the children underwent CT and MRI examination, blood routine examination, and cerebrospinal fluid examination after admission. This work uses the random number table method to classify the subjects into control group and observation group, each consisting of 30 cases. Children in the control group were provided with the routine nursing intervention, whereas children in the observation group were subjected to incentive nursing intervention. The baseline data, ECG monitoring indicators, body abnormalities, and clinical symptom relief time of the two groups of children were compared and the results of diffusion weighted MRI scans were analyzed and the ADC values were counted. RESULTS: The two groups of children were compared on the basis of baseline data, and the variation was not statistically substantial (P > 0.05). The cases of children in the control group had higher heart rate and respiration, and physical dysfunction, language dysfunction, unconsciousness, and nervous dysfunction were more than those in the observation group. However, the cases of blood oxygen saturation were less than those of the observation group. After nursing intervention done for the control group, remission time of clinical symptoms such as convulsion, physical dysfunction, unconsciousness, and nerve dysfunction was longer relative to the observation group (all P < 0.05 are considered). CONCLUSION: The diffusion weighted MRI had diagnostic significance for severe viral encephalitis and myocarditis. For children with severe viral encephalitis and myocarditis, clinical incentive nursing intervention was particularly imperative. It can not only help children to relieve symptoms and control the deterioration of the disease in a short time but also help improve the quality of life of the children and the confidence of family members to cope with the disease.","Ren, Qiuai; Guo, Li; Liu, XiuLan; Xiao, PengFei; Tang, Shuifang; Sharma, Ashutosh; Walia, Tarandeep Singh; Shah, Mohd Asif",J Healthc Eng,50,13

Despite these differences, ethics training programs should recognise that the transition from medical students to healthcare professionals entails a longitudinal process where ethics knowledge, skills and identity continue to build and deepen over time with clinical exposure. A systematic scoping review is proposed to analyse current postgraduate medical ethics training and assessment programs in peer-reviewed literature to guide the development of a local physician training curriculum. METHODS: With a constructivist perspective and relativist lens, this systematic scoping review on postgraduate medical ethics training and assessment will adopt the Systematic Evidence Based Approach (SEBA) to create a transparent and reproducible review. RESULTS: The first search involving the teaching of ethics yielded 7669 abstracts with 573 full text articles evaluated and 66 articles included. The second search involving the assessment of ethics identified 9919 abstracts with 333 full text articles reviewed and 29 articles included. The themes identified from the two searches were the goals and objectives, content, pedagogy, enabling and limiting factors of teaching ethics and assessment modalities used. Despite inherent disparities in ethics training programs, they provide a platform for learners to apply knowledge, translating it to skill and eventually becoming part of the identity of the learner. Illustrating the longitudinal nature of ethics training, the spiral curriculum seamlessly integrates and fortifies prevailing ethical knowledge acquired in medical school with the layering of new specialty, clinical and research specific content in professional practice. Various assessment methods are employed with special mention of portfolios as a longitudinal assessment modality that showcase the impact of ethics training on the development of professional identity formation (PIF). CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic scoping review has elicited key learning points in the teaching and assessment of ethics in the postgraduate setting. However, more research needs to be done on establishing Entrustable Professional Activities (EPA)s in ethics, with further exploration of the use of portfolios and key factors influencing its design, implementation and assessment of PIF and micro-credentialling in ethics practice.

In early stages it can be successfully treated with surgery, but as the disease expands the survival rate drops significantly. For many years the mainstay of treatment for metastatic melanoma was chemotherapeutic agents, even though they failed to prove survival prolongation. After the advent of ipilimumab, a survival benefit and better overall response rate could be offered to the patients. Other new therapies, such as immunotherapies, targeted therapies, vaccines, and small molecules, are currently being studied. Also, combination regimens have demonstrated superiority to some monotherapies. Nowadays, ipilimumab should no longer be considered the first-line therapy given its severe toxicity and lower efficacy, while nivolumab remains efficacious and has a good safety profile. T-VEC as monotherapy has been shown to be an elegant alternative even for the elderly or cases of head and neck melanomas. If the BRAF mutation status is positive, the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib could be an option to consider. Despite the success of the novel treatments, their effectiveness is still limited. New studies have opened up new avenues for future research in melanoma treatment, which is expected to lead to better therapeutic outcomes for our patients. The objective of this review is to discuss the novel therapies for metastatic melanoma that have been tested in humans during the last 3 years to obtain a sharper perspective of the available treatment options for specific patient characteristics.","Villani, Alessia; Scalvenzi, Massimiliano; Fabbrocini, Gabriella; Ocampo-Candiani, Jorge; Ocampo-Garza, Sonia Sofía",Dermatol Ther (Heidelb),50,8

With the adoption of IoT in consumer electronics, this industry is set to rise exponentially. In recent times, the demand for consumer electronics rises amidst the pandemic due to a paradigm shift from in-office culture to work from home.

METHODS: To overcome these limitations, Blockchain technology has been adopted in recent years, however, it has its own set of limitations in its widespread implementation. Hence, we propose a methodology using the IOTA platform, a distributed ledger technology (DLT) for secured communication between consumer electronics devices and appliances.

Data preprocessing and quality controls are carried out using an R pipeline and packages like CATALYST for bead-normalization and debarcoding, flowAI and flowCut for signal anomaly cleaning, AOF for files quality control, flowClean and flowDensity for gating, CytoNorm for batch normalization and FlowSOM and UMAP for data exploration. As proper experimental design is key in obtaining good quality events, we also include the sample processing protocol used to generate the data. Both, analysis and experimental pipelines are easy to scale-up, thus the workflow presented here is particularly suitable for large-scale, multicenter, multibatch and retrospective studies.","Rybakowska, Paulina; Van Gassen, Sofie; Quintelier, Katrien; Saeys, Yvan; Alarcón-Riquelme, Marta E.; Marañón, Concepción",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,50,1

Previous studies have shown that cigarette smoke dysregulated metabolites; however, limited information is available with electronic cigarette (e-cig) vaping. We hypothesized that e-cig vaping and cigarette smoking alters systemic metabolites, and we propose to understand the specific metabolic signature between e-cig users and cigarette smokers. Plasma from non-smoker controls, cigarette smokers, and e-cig users was collected, and metabolites were identified by UPLC-MS (ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometer). Nicotine degradation was activated by e-cig vaping and cigarette smoking with increased concentrations of cotinine, cotinine N-oxide, (S)-nicotine, and (R)-6-hydroxynicotine. Additionally, we found significantly decreased concentrations in metabolites associated with tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle pathways in e-cig users versus cigarette smokers, such as d-glucose, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylmalate, (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, O-phosphoethanolamine, malathion, d-threo-isocitrate, malic acid, and 4-acetamidobutanoic acid.

Overall, e-cig vaping dysregulated TCA cycle-related metabolites while cigarette smoking altered sphingolipid metabolites. Both e-cig and cigarette smoke increased nicotinic metabolites. Therefore, specific metabolic signatures altered by e-cig vaping and cigarette smoking could serve as potential systemic biomarkers for early pathogenesis of cardiopulmonary diseases.","Wang, Qixin; Ji, Xiangming; Rahman, Irfan",Metabolites,50,11

OBJECTIVE: We conducted ethnobotanical and ethnomedicine research on plants traditionally used to treat various diseases in central region of Syria. METHODS: Information was collected from 2019 to 2021 from the cities of Homs and Hama and their villages, which are two governorates located in central Syria, after interviews with traditional practitioners called Attarin, and many other people. Plant specimens were collected according to different references concerning medicinal plants of Syria, to document the traditional uses of plants at least two of the traditional healers and three other people were asked. RESULTS: In this survey, we listed 76 medicinal plants belonging to 39 families in alphabetical order with the parts used and the method of preparation according to their therapeutic use, which are used to treat 106 ailments. CONCLUSIONS: Many of the uses of medicinal plants mentioned in this survey are still under study. There is no doubt that this study will provide new data that could contribute to further pharmacological discoveries by identifying the active ingredients and their mechanism of effect by doing additional pharmacological work to confirm the alleged biological activities of these plants.","Khatib, Chadi; Nattouf, Abdulhakim; Hasan Agha, Mohamad Isam",,50,1

By loading transfer RNAs (tRNAs) with their cognate amino acids, ARS are essential for protein translation. However, it remains unknown why ARS deficiencies lead to specific symptoms, especially early life and during infections. We set out to increase pathophysiological insight and improve therapeutic possibilities. METHODS: In fibroblasts from patients with isoleucyl-RS (IARS), leucyl-RS (LARS), phenylalanyl-RS-beta-subunit (FARSB), and seryl-RS (SARS) deficiencies, we investigated aminoacylation activity, thermostability, and sensitivity to ARS-specific amino acid concentrations, and developed personalized treatments. RESULTS: Aminoacylation activity was reduced in all patients, and further diminished at 38.5/40 °C (P(LARS) and P(FARSB)), consistent with infectious deteriorations. With lower cognate amino acid concentrations, patient fibroblast growth was severely affected. To prevent local and/or temporal deficiencies, we treated patients with corresponding amino acids (follow-up: 1/2–2 2/3rd years), and intensified treatment during infections. All patients showed beneficial treatment effects, most strikingly in growth (without tube feeding), head circumference, development, coping with infections, and oxygen dependency. CONCLUSION: For these four ARS deficiencies, we observed a common disease mechanism of episodic insufficient aminoacylation to meet translational demands and illustrate the power of amino acid supplementation for the expanding ARS patient group. Moreover, we provide a strategy for personalized preclinical functional evaluation.","Kok, Gautam; Tseng, Laura; Schene, Imre F.; Dijsselhof, Monique E.; Salomons, Gajja; Mendes, Marisa I.; Smith, Desiree E.

STUDY DESIGN: A comprehensive review of the literature was performed, followed by a detailed analysis of the relevant data that has been published on the topic. METHODS: Clinical key, Uptodate, Ovid, Ebscohost, Pubmed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Dynamed, Web of Science and The Cochrane Library were systematically searched. Once the search was completed, dynamic sleep MRI data were analyzed. RESULTS: Nineteen articles reported on 410 OSA patients and 79 controls that underwent dynamic sleep MRI and were included in this review. For meta-analysis of dynamic sleep MRI data, eight articles presented relevant data on 160 OSA patients. Obstruction was reported as follows: retropalatal (RP) 98%, retroglossal (RG) 41% and hypopharyngeal (HP) in 5%. Lateral pharyngeal wall (LPW) collapse was found in 35/73 (48%) patients. The combinations of RP + RG were observed in 24% and RP + RG + LPW in 16%. If sedation was used, 98% of study participants fell asleep compared to 66% of unsedated participants. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic sleep MRI has demonstrated that nearly all patients have retropalatal obstruction, retroglossal obstruction is common and hypopharyngeal obstruction is rare. Nearly all patients (98%) who are sedated are able to fall asleep during the MRI. There is significant heterogeneity in the literature and standardization is needed.

State-of-the-art studies using micro-doppler frequency have been conducted to classify the space object targets. However, existing studies rely highly on feature extraction methods. Therefore, the generalization performance of the classifier is limited and there is room for improvement. Recently, to improve the classification performance, the popular approaches are to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with the help of transfer learning and use the generative adversarial network (GAN) to increase the training datasets. However, these methods still have drawbacks. First, they use only one feature to train the network. Therefore, the existing methods cannot guarantee that the classifier learns more robust target characteristics. Second, it is difficult to obtain large amounts of data that accurately mimic real-world target features by performing data augmentation via GAN instead of simulation. To mitigate the above problem, we propose a transfer learning-based parallel network with the spectrogram and the cadence velocity diagram (CVD) as the inputs. In addition, we obtain an EM simulation-based dataset. The radar-received signal is simulated according to a variety of dynamics using the concept of shooting and bouncing rays with relative aspect angles rather than the scattering center reconstruction method. Our proposed model is evaluated on our generated dataset. The proposed method achieved about 0.01 to 0.39% higher accuracy than the pre-trained networks with a single input feature.","Jung, Kwangyong; Lee, Jae-In; Kim, Nammoon; Oh, Sunjin; Seo, Dong-Wook",Sensors (Basel),50,1

Therefore, climate change has an important impact on the epidemiology of human infections with these pathogens. In recent years large outbreaks have been repeatedly observed during the summer months in temperate climate zones. OBJECTIVE: To inform medical professionals about the potentially life-threatening diseases caused by non-cholera Vibrio spp. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Review of the current literature on infections with non-cholera Vibrio spp. in general and on the epidemiological situation in Germany in particular. RESULTS: Non-cholera Vibrio spp. predominantly cause wound and ear infections after contact with contaminated seawater and gastroenteritis after consumption of undercooked seafood. As there have not been mandatory notification systems for these pathogens in Germany up to March 2020, a high number of unreported cases must be assumed. Immunosuppressed and chronically ill patients have a much higher risk for severe courses of diseases. If an infection with non-cholera Vibrio spp. is suspected anti-infective treatment should be promptly initiated and surgical cleansing is often necessary for wound and soft tissue infections. CONCLUSION: Due to the ongoing global warming an increased incidence of human infections with non-cholera Vibrio spp. must be expected in the future. Medical professionals should be aware of these bacterial pathogens and the potentially life-threatening infections in order to enable timely diagnostics and treatment.","Brehm, Thomas Theo; Dupke, Susann; Hauk, Gerhard; Fickenscher, Helmut; Rohde, Holger; Berneking, Laura",Internist (Berl),50,1

These same drivers also contribute to marked cancer health disparities in high-income countries. Studying cancer in LMICs provides opportunities to better understand and address these drivers to benefit populations worldwide, and reflecting this, global oncology as an academic discipline has grown substantially in recent years. However, sustaining this growth requires a uniquely trained workforce with the skills to pursue relevant, rigorous, and equitable global oncology research.

RECENT FINDINGS: The literature suggests that the types of TFSV discussed are prevalent and the impacts far-reaching. There is emerging evidence outlining the characteristics associated with and motivations behind these acts of TFSV. The impacts of TFSV victimization can be diverse and damaging. Many questions about TFSV are unanswered, highlighting the need for more empirical investigations. SUMMARY: Technology can be used to facilitate sexual violence through several means.

Here, 32 rats were divided into four groups, gavaged with L. acidophilus LA14 (3 × 10(9) CFU) or phosphate-buffered saline for 7 days, and then intraperitoneally injected with d-galactosamine or saline. After 24 h, blood, liver, ileum, and feces samples were collected for liver injury, inflammation, intestinal barrier, gut microbiota, metabolome, and transcriptome analyses. Pretreatment with L. acidophilus LA14 alleviated the d-galactosamine-induced elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and bile acids; mitigated the histological injury to the liver and gut; and suppressed the inflammatory cytokines macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP-1α), MIP-3α, and MCP-1. L. acidophilus LA14 also ameliorated the d-galactosamine-induced dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and metabolism, such as the enrichment of Bacteroides sp. strain dnLKV3 and the depletion of Streptococcus, butanoic acid, and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. The underlying mechanism of L. acidophilus LA14 included prevention of not only the d-galactosamine-induced upregulation of infection- and tumor-related pathways but also the d-galactosamine-induced downregulation of antioxidation-related pathways during this process, as reflected by the liver transcriptome and proteome analyses. Furthermore, the administration of L. acidophilus LA14 to healthy rats did not alter the tested liver indicators but significantly enriched the beneficial Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, promoted metabolism and regulated pathways to improve immunity. The ability of L. acidophilus LA14 to alleviate liver injury was further confirmed with an acetaminophen-induced mouse model. These results might provide a reference for future studies on the application of L. acidophilus LA14 for the prevention of liver injury. IMPORTANCE The probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus LA14 is widely used, but its effect on liver diseases has not been elucidated. We explored the protective effect of L. acidophilus LA14 on the liver using rats with d-galactosamine-induced liver injury. Pretreatment with L. acidophilus LA14 alleviated the d-galactosamine-induced elevation of serum ALT, AST, ALP, and bile acids, mitigated the histological injury to the liver and gut, and suppressed the inflammatory cytokines MIP-1α, MIP-3α, and MCP-1. These effects were correlated with the modulations of the gut microbiome, metabolome, and hepatic gene expression induced by L. acidophilus LA14. Moreover, the ability of L. acidophilus LA14 to alleviate liver injury was further confirmed with an acetaminophen-induced mouse model. These results might provide a reference for future studies on the application of L. acidophilus LA14 for the prevention of liver injury.","Lv, Longxian; Yao, Chunyan; Yan, Ren; Jiang, Huiyong; Wang, Qiangqiang; Wang, Kaicen; Ren, Siqi; Jiang, Shandong; Xia, Jiafeng; Li, Shengjie; Yu, Ying",,50,28

Resilience was assessed with the Spanish version of the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS). Results of independent samples t-tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed no significant differences on the level of resilience according to the practiced sport or the competitive level. However, the analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) showed that they were related to the gender and age of the athletes, being higher in males than in females, and there was a positive correlation with age.

This co-evolutionary process poses a fundamental challenge to the development of broadly effective vaccines and diagnostics against a diversifying pathogen. Based on surveys of natural allele frequencies and experimental immunization of mice, we show high antigenic specificities of natural variants of the outer surface protein C (OspC), a dominant antigen of a Lyme Disease-causing bacterium (Borrelia burgdorferi). To overcome the challenge of OspC antigenic diversity to clinical development of preventive measures, we implemented a number of evolution-informed strategies to broaden OspC antigenic reactivity. In particular, the centroid algorithm—a genetic algorithm to generate sequences that minimize amino-acid differences with natural variants—generated synthetic OspC analogs with the greatest promise as diagnostic and vaccine candidates against diverse Lyme pathogen strains co-existing in the Northeast United States. Mechanistically, we propose a model of maximum antigen diversification (MAD) mediated by amino-acid variations distributed across the hypervariable regions on the OspC molecule. Under the MAD hypothesis, evolutionary centroids display broad cross-reactivity by occupying the central void in the antigenic space excavated by diversifying natural variants. In contrast to vaccine designs based on concatenated epitopes, the evolutionary algorithms generate analogs of natural antigens and are automated. The novel centroid algorithm and the evolutionary antigen designs based on consensus and ancestral sequences have broad implications for combating diversifying pathogens driven by pathogen–host co-evolution.","Di, Lia; Akther, Saymon; Bezrucenkovas, Edgaras; Ivanova, Larisa; Sulkow, Brian; Wu, Bing; Mneimneh, Saad; Gomes-Solecki, Maria; Qiu, Wei-Gang",ISME J,50,8

Currently, there is no standard method for predicting successful weaning from NIV. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate whether a weaning index can predict NIV outcomes of patients with AECOPD. METHODS: This study was conducted at a single academic public hospital in northern Taiwan from February 2019 to January 2021. Patients with AECOPD admitted to the hospital with respiratory failure who were treated with NIV were included in the study. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors of successful weaning from NIV. Receiver operating characteristic curve methodology was used to assess the predictive capacity. RESULTS: A total of 85 patients were enrolled, 65.9% of whom were successfully weaned from NIV. The patients had a mean age of 75.8 years and were mostly men (89.4%). The rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) (P < 0.001), maximum inspiratory pressure (P = 0.014), and maximum expiratory pressure (P = 0.004) of the successful group were significant while preparing to wean. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the RSBI was 0.804, which was considered excellent discrimination. CONCLUSION: The RSBI predicted successful weaning from NIV in patients with AECOPD with hypercapnic respiratory failure. This index may be useful for selecting patients with AECOPD that are suitable for NIV weaning.","Yu, Jie; Lee, Meng-Rui; Chen, Chung-Ting; Lin, Yi-Tsung; How, Chorng-Kuang",Lung,50,8

Both the plant and the alkaloid possess numerous protective properties such as anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, anti-hypertensive, anti-rhythmic, and sedative effects. Several studies support the significance of the anti-inflammatory activity of the plant as an underlying mechanism for most of the pharmacological activities of the alkaloid. Rhy is effective in protecting both the central nervous system and cardiovascular system. Cerebro-cardiovascular disease primarily occurs due to changes in lifestyle habits. Many previous studies have highlighted the significance of Rhy in modulating calcium channels and potassium channels, thereby protecting the brain from neurodegenerative diseases and related effects. Rhy also has anticoagulation and anti-platelet aggregation activity. Although Rhy has displayed its role in protecting the cardiovascular system, very little is explored about its intervention in early atherosclerosis. Extensive studies are required to understand the cardioprotective effects of Rhye. This review summarized and discussed the various pharmacological effects of Rhy in neuro- and cardioprotection and in particular the relevance of Rhy in preventing early atherosclerosis using Rhy-loaded nanoparticles.","Geetha, Rajeswari Gopal; Ramachandran, Surya",Pharmaceutics,50,1

PPG signal diffusive dynamics are strongly dependent on the vascular bed’s biostructure, unique to each individual. The dynamic characteristics of the PPG signal are more stable over time than its morphological features, particularly in the presence of psychosomatic conditions. Besides its robustness, our biometric method is anti-spoofing, given the complex nature of the blood network. Our proposal trains using a national research study database with 40 real-world PPG signals measured with commercial equipment. Biometric system results for input data, raw and preprocessed, are studied and compared with eight primary biometric methods related to PPG, achieving the best equal error rate (ERR) and processing times with a single attempt, among all of them.","de Pedro-Carracedo, Javier; Fuentes-Jimenez, David; Ugena, Ana María; Gonzalez-Marcos, Ana Pilar",Sensors (Basel),50,28

We used the clinically relevant ConM SOSIP trimer to compare the ability of different adjuvants (squalene emulsion, ISCOMATRIX, GLA-LSQ, and MPLA liposomes) to support neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses in rabbits. The trimers were administered as free proteins or on nanoparticles. The rank order for the adjuvants was ISCOMATRIX > SE > GLA-LSQ ~ MPLA liposomes > no adjuvant. Stronger NAb responses were elicited when the ConM SOSIP trimers were presented on ferritin nanoparticles. We also found that the GLA-LSQ adjuvant induced an unexpectedly strong antibody response to the ferritin core of the nanoparticles. This “off-target” effect may have compromised its ability to induce the more desired antitrimer antibodies. In summary, both adjuvants and nanoparticle display can improve the magnitude of the antibody response to SOSIP trimers but the best combination of trimer presentation and adjuvant can only be identified experimentally.","Sliepen, Kwinten; Schermer, Edith; Bontjer, Ilja; Burger, Judith A.; Lévai, Réka Felfödiné; Mundsperger, Philipp; Brouwer, Philip J.

Such individualisation is possible and necessary, given the known inter-individual variation in cycle length. To achieve this, a hybrid predictive model was built using data on 16,524 cycles collected from a sample of 2125 women (mean age 34.38 years, range 18.00–47.10, number of menstrual cycles ranging from 4 to 53). A mixed-effect state-space model was fitted to capture the within-subject temporal correlation, incorporating a Bayesian approach for process forecasting to predict the duration (in days) of the next menstrual cycle. The modelling procedure was split into three steps (1) a time trend component using a random walk with an overdispersion parameter, (2) an autocorrelation component using an autoregressive moving-average model, and (3) a linear predictor to account for covariates (e.g. injury, stomach cramps, training intensity). The inclusion of an overdispersion parameter suggested that [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] of cycles in the sample were overdispersed. The random walk standard deviation for a non-overdispersed cycle is [Formula: see text] [1.00, 1.09] days while under an overdispersed cycle, the menstrual cycle variance increase in 4.78 [4.57, 5.00] days. To assess the performance and prediction accuracy of the model, each woman’s last observation was used as test data. The root mean square error (RMSE), concordance correlation coefficient and Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between the observed and predicted values were calculated. The model had an RMSE of 1.6412 days, a precision of 0.7361 and overall accuracy of 0.9871. In conclusion, the hybrid model presented here is a helpful approach for predicting menstrual cycle length, which in turn can be used to support female athlete wellness.","de Paula Oliveira, Thiago; Bruinvels, Georgie; Pedlar, Charles R; Moore, Brian; Newell, John",Sci Rep,50,8

Dysregulation in the pathway is associated with vascular dysfunction and numerous diseases that involve abnormal vascular permeability and endothelial cell inflammation. The understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the Ang–Tie pathway has been limited due to the complex reaction network formed by the ligands, receptors, and molecular regulatory mechanisms. In this study, we developed a mechanistic computational model of the Ang–Tie signaling pathway validated against experimental data. The model captures and reproduces the experimentally observed junctional localization and downstream signaling of the Ang–Tie signaling axis, as well as the time-dependent role of receptor Tie1. The model predicts that Tie1 modulates Tie2’s response to the context-dependent agonist Ang2 by junctional interactions. Furthermore, modulation of Tie1’s junctional localization, inhibition of Tie2 extracellular domain cleavage, and inhibition of VE-PTP are identified as potential molecular strategies for potentiating Ang2’s agonistic activity and rescuing Tie2 signaling in inflammatory endothelial cells.","Zhang, Yu; Kontos, Christopher D.; Annex, Brian H.; Popel, Aleksander S.",NPJ Syst Biol Appl,50,1

Methods: Expressional profiling from two public datasets (GSE36961 and GSE141910) of human HCM and healthy control cardiac tissues was obtained from the GEO database. After data preprocessing, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were then screened between HCM and healthy control cardiac tissues in parallel. Gene Ontology, pathway functional enrichment, and gene set enrichment analysis were performed using DAVID and GSEA application. The compositional patterns of immune and stromal cells in HCM and control cardiac tissues were estimated based on the merged data using xCell. Protein–protein interaction (PPI) network and module analyses were constructed by STRING and Cytoscape applications. Gender-based expressional differences analyses were also conducted to explore gender differences in HCM. GSE130036 and clinical samples were used for verification analyses. Results: A total of 310 DEGs were identified. Upregulated DEGs were mainly enriched in “adhesion” and “apoptotic process” in the biological process. As for the downregulated DEGs, “inflammatory response,” “innate immune response,” “phagosome,” and “JAK-STAT signaling pathway” were highly enriched. Immune infiltration analyses suggested that the scores of macrophages, monocytes, DC, Th1, Treg, and plasma cells in the HCM group were significantly decreased, while CD8(+) T cells, basophils, fibroblasts, and platelets were significantly enriched. Module analyses revealed that STAT3, as the hub genes in HCM together with LYVE1(+)CD163(+) macrophages, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of HCM while there were no obvious gender differences in the HCM samples from selected datasets. Verification analyses performed on GSE130036 and clinical samples showed a strong positive correlation (Spearman correlation = 0.7646) and a good co-localization relationship between LYVE1 and CD163, suggesting the potential function of LYVE1(+)CD163(+) macrophages in maintaining the homeostasis of cardiac tissue. Conclusion: STAT3-related pathway and CD163(+)LYVE1(+) macrophages were identified as the potential key pathway and immune cells in HCM and may serve as interesting targets for further in-depth research.","Zhang, Xu-Zhe; Zhang, Si; Tang, Ting-Ting; Cheng, Xiang",Front Cardiovasc Med,50,1

Detecting plaques with high inflammatory activity and specifically treating those lesions can be crucial to prevent life-threatening cardiovascular events. Methods: Here, we developed a macrophage mannose receptor (MMR)-targeted theranostic nanodrug (mannose-polyethylene glycol-glycol chitosan-deoxycholic acid-cyanine 7-lobeglitazone; MMR-Lobe-Cy) designed to identify inflammatory activity as well as to deliver peroxisome proliferator-activated gamma (PPARγ) agonist, lobeglitazone, specifically to high-risk plaques based on the high mannose receptor specificity. The MMR-Lobe-Cy was intravenously injected into balloon-injured atheromatous rabbits and serial in vivo optical coherence tomography (OCT)-near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) structural-molecular imaging was performed. Results: One week after MMR-Lobe-Cy administration, the inflammatory NIRF signals in the plaques notably decreased compared to the baseline whereas the signals in saline controls even increased over time. In accordance with in vivo imaging findings, ex vivo NIRF signals on fluorescence reflectance imaging (FRI) and plaque inflammation by immunostainings significantly decreased compared to oral lobeglitazone group or saline controls. The anti-inflammatory effect of MMR-Lobe-Cy was mediated by inhibition of TLR4/NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, acute resolution of inflammation altered the inflamed plaque into a stable phenotype with less macrophages and collagen-rich matrix. Conclusion: Macrophage targeted PPARγ activator labeled with NIRF rapidly stabilized the inflamed plaques in coronary sized artery, which could be quantitatively assessed using intravascular OCT-NIRF imaging. This novel theranostic approach provides a promising theranostic strategy for high-risk coronary plaques.","Song, Joon Woo; Nam, Hyeong Soo; Ahn, Jae Won; Park, Hyun-Sang; Kang, Dong Oh; Kim, Hyun Jung; Kim, Yeon Hoon; Han, Jeongmoo; Choi, Jah Yeon; Lee, Seung-Yul; Kim, Sunwon; Oh, Wang-Yuhl; Yoo, Hongki; Park, Kyeongsoon; Kim, Jin Won",Theranostics,50,8

Its incidence is in dramatic growth in Western societies and there is a need of both biomarkers to support the clinical diagnosis and drugs for the treatment of AD. The diagnostic criteria of AD are based on clinical data. However, it is necessary to develop biomarkers considering the neuropathology of AD. The A(2A) receptor, a G-protein coupled member of the P1 family of adenosine receptors, has different functions crucial for neurodegeneration. Its activation in the hippocampal region regulates synaptic plasticity and in particular glutamate release, NMDA receptor activation and calcium influx. Additionally, it exerts effects in neuroinflammation, regulating the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In AD patients, its expression is increased in the hippocampus/entorhinal cortex more than in the frontal cortex, a phenomenon not observed in age-matched control brains, indicating an association with AD pathology. It is upregulated in peripheral blood cells of patients affected by AD, thus reflecting its increase at central neuronal level.

Parental decision making when accessing unscheduled care for their children is multifaceted and must be better understood to inform policy and practice. DESIGN: Nineteen semi‐structured interviews and one focus group (n = 4) with parents of children younger than twelve in Ireland were conducted. Participants had accessed unscheduled care for their children in the past. Data were thematically analysed. RESULTS: Parents accessed unscheduled care for their children after reaching capacity to manage the child's health themselves. This was informed by factors such as parental experience, perceived urgency and need for reassurance. Parents considered the necessity to access care and situated their health‐seeking behaviour within a framework of ‘appropriateness’. Where parents sought unscheduled care was largely determined by timely access, and inability to secure a general practitioner (GP) appointment often led parents to access other services. Parents expressed a need for more support in navigating unscheduled care options. CONCLUSIONS: Better resources to educate and support parents are required, and structural issues, such as accessibility to GPs, need to be addressed to enable parents to better navigate the unscheduled health system and manage their children's health. The discourse around ‘appropriate’ and ‘inappropriate’ access to health care has permeated parental decision making when accessing unscheduled health care for their children. What constitutes appropriate access should be examined, and a shift away from this framing of health‐seeking behaviour may be warranted.

Methods: The study involved 207 patients in advanced stages (III–IV) of HNC. RTOG/EORTC scale was used to assess OM. The pre-treatment NLR was specified as the absolute neutrophil count divided by the absolute lymphocyte count. Results: Starting from second to seventh week of RT, we observed a significant, positive correlation between NLR values and OM grade. From the second to seventh week of RT, higher NLR values were related with significant increases (from 2- to over 24-fold) in the risk of occurrence of more severe OM (multivariate analysis confirmed its independent influence). Moreover, multivariate analysis for survival revealed that both higher TNM stage (HR = 1.84; p = 0.0043) and higher NLR values (HR = 1.48; p = 0.0395) were independent prognostic factors. Conclusion: NLR is a simple and accurate parameter that is useful in the evaluation of the risk of more severe OM, as well as an independent prognostic factor of OS in patients subjected to RT due to HNC.","Homa-Mlak, Iwona; Brzozowska, Anna; Mlak, Radosław; Szudy-Szczyrek, Aneta; Małecka-Massalska, Teresa",J Clin Med,50,1

GS-5734 is a novel nucleotide analog prodrug in the development for treatment of EBOV. METHOD: Antiviral activity of GS-5734 has been established in vitro against a wide range of pathogenic RNA virus families, including filoviruses, coronaviruses, and paramyxoviruses (EC(50) = 37 to 200 nM) (Warren et al., Nature 2016; Sheahan et al., Sci Transl Med 2017; Lo et al., Sci Rep 2017). Herein, we describe the in vivo translation of the broad-spectrum activity of GS-5734 in relevant animal disease models for Ebola, Marburg, MERS-CoV, and Nipah. RESULT: Therapeutic efficacy against multiple filoviruses with 80–100% survival was observed in rhesus monkeys infected with lethal doses of EBOV (Kikwit/1995 or Makona/2014) or Marburg virus and treated with once daily intravenous (IV) administration of 5 to 10 mg/kg GS-5734 beginning 3 to 5 days post-infection (p.i.). In all rhesus monkey filovirus infection models, GS-5734 significantly reduced systemic viremia and ameliorated severe clinical disease signs and anatomic pathology. In mice infected with MERS-CoV, twice daily subcutaneous administration of 25 mg/kg GS-5734 beginning 1 day p.i. significantly reduced lung viral load and improved respiratory function. In rhesus monkeys, once-daily IV administration of 5 mg/kg GS-5734 initiated 1 day prior to MERS-CoV infection reduced lung viral load, improved clinical disease signs, and ameliorated severe lung pathology. Finally, in African green monkeys infected with a lethal dose of Nipah virus therapeutic once-daily IV administration of 10 mg/kg GS-5734, starting 1 day p.i. resulted in 100% survival to at least day 35 without any major respiratory or CNS symptoms. CONCLUSION: GS-5734 is currently being tested in a phase 2 study in male Ebola survivors with persistent viral RNA in semen. Lyophilized drug formulation has been developed that can be administered to humans via a 30-minutes IV infusion and does not require cold chain storage. Together, these results support further development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum antiviral to treat viral infections with high mortality and significant outbreak potential. DISCLOSURES: R.

Immediately after cases were finished, but prior to cleaning, the 3M Clean-Trace Clinical Hygiene Monitoring System was used to quantify bioburden (in surface ATP concentration) on 24 surfaces in each of 8 ORs. These 24 surfaces were previously identified by the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses as high-touch surfaces and various disciplines are responsible for their cleaning. Each OR was sampled 1–4 times. A surface passed the test of cleanliness if the result was <250 relative light units (RLUs). RESULTS: In all, 364 surfaces were tested. The median RLUs were <250, 250–850, and >850 RLUs for 7, 11, and 6 surfaces, respectively. Of the 24 surfaces tested, all demonstrated bioburden ≥250 at least once. Median RLUs for each surface ranged from 39-2282 and median RLUs for each OR ranged from 196 to 1534. The highest bioburden occurred following cardiac surgery (median 1534, range 24-13275 RLU) and the lowest bioburden occurred after neurosurgery (median 196, range 23-2475 RLU). The surfaces with the highest bioburden were the anesthesia keyboards (median 2282, range 347-38376 RLU) and core door handles (median 1471, range 140–6788 RLU) and those with the lowest bioburden were the Mayo stand (median 39, range 19-765 RLU) and back table (median 39, range 17-406 RLU). CONCLUSION: ATP testing demonstrated that most OR surfaces were contaminated with organic material. While OR surfaces prior to cleaning are expected to be contaminated, these data highlight the importance of cleaning/disinfection. These findings are being used to develop educational tools and interventions for the interdisciplinary OR team, which will focus on delineation of cleaning responsibilities, the use of appropriate cleaning products, and audits of end-of-case cleaning and terminal cleaning.

Although humoral immunity appears redundant for the control of acute virus replication, it is vital in maintaining virus at levels detectable only by RNA analysis. T cell mediated control of acute infection cannot be sustained in antibody (Ab) deficient mice, resulting in virus reactivation. The protective role of Ab during persistence is strongly supported by detection of Ab in the cerebrospinal fluid of MHV infected rodents and maintenance of virus specific Ab secreting cells (ASC) in the CNS long after virus clearance. Ab mediated neutralization constitutes the major mechanism of protection, although fusion inhibition also plays a minor role. Delayed accumulation of ASC, concomitant with a decline in T cell function, assures control of residual virus while minimizing T cell mediated pathology. Although there is little evidence for a detrimental role of Ab in demyelination, an association between Ab mediated protection and remyelination is unclear.","Ramakrishna, C.; Tschen, S.; Bergmann, C.

In addition to its serine protease inhibitory action, alpha-1 antitrypsin exhibits broader anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity, and increasing its serum concentration by the administration of exogenous alpha-1 antitrypsin to above-normal levels potentially could be therapeutic in conditions other than alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In vitro observations, studies in animal models and in some instances early human trials suggest that intravenous or inhaled alpha-1 antitrypsin has beneficial effects in type 1 diabetes, viral infections, graft-versus-host disease, cystic fibrosis, and alpha-1 antitrypsin-replete chronic obstructive pulmonary disease among others.

Earlier articles in supply chain management by Kraljic (1983) and Treleven, and Schweickhart (1988) stressed the importance to consider the risks arising from interconnected flows of material, information and funds in inter-organizational networks. However, during the last several years, the interest in this topic has significantly gained momentum. A large body of recent literature reports on events that disrupted supply chains and on their negative impact on businesses. These reports are paralleled by numerous articles from researchers and practitioners proposing best practices, guidelines, and concepts for risk management strategies that aim to ultimately create resilient supply chains. But what actually fuelled this recent attention to supply chain risks and their management? There are arguably at least two significant factors.","Wagner, Stephan M.; Bode, Christoph",Supply Chain Risk,50,1

Throughout this surgical textbook, virtually all chapters dealing with individual organs have some portion of that chapter devoted to the surgical treatment of primary cancer at that site. For example, Chapter 96 on breast disease primarily discusses the treatment of cancer because this is by far the predominant surgical disease in that organ. On the other hand, Chapter 49 on the small intestine has a much smaller proportion dealing with cancer as primary malignancies comprise a smaller fraction of the surgical diseases involving the small intestine. A specialized type or category of surgical treatment for cancer can be categorized as regional therapy. As opposed to straightforward surgical resection, in this type of therapy a specific region or area of the body is treated. Regional therapy is primarily applicable to metastatic disease limited to one site or area of the body. There are two broad categories of regional therapy of cancer: (1) vascular-based treatments and (2) intracavitary treatments. The most successfully treated areas of the body by vascular means are the extremities and the liver.","Fraker, Douglas L.",Surgery,50,28

The etiological agent of the disease is porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which belongs to Coronaviridae. The disease has spread globally and became an endemic disease in many Asian and European countries causing transient diarrhea in postweaning pigs with low mortalities for several decades. Since late 2010, field outbreaks of PED, which reemerged in China, spread to Asian and some European countries and emerged in North America; all led to enormous economic losses in porcine industry. New variants of PEDV exhibit not only significant genetic variations as compared to historic PEDV strains but also more virulent causing severe vomiting and watery yellowish diarrhea in suckling piglets under 1 week of age. Factors underlying the potential pathogenesis of the recent PEDV outbreaks include the mutation of the virus, the lacking of maternal antibodies for the protection of piglets, and the slower turnover rate of enterocytes (5–7 days) of the neonatal piglets as compared to postweaning pigs (2–3 days). The emerging and reemerging of the new variants of PEDV highlight the importance of reviewing the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and epidemiology of the disease.","Peng, Ju-Yi; Jian, Cai-Zhen; Chang, Chia-Yu; Chang, Hui-Wen",Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases of Livestock,50,1

Yet the goals of high native species diversity and weed management are difficult to achieve in grassland restoration projects. To increase our understanding of whether synergies exist between these goals (i.e. whether early introduction of a larger number of species might improve both outcomes in the reassembly of native grassland), we examined the relationships between plant species number, functional group number and resource use during the establishment phase of direct‐sown grassland. We did this by sowing a representative suite of species (at varying levels of species number and functional group number) into experimental plots and then measuring and analysing the extent to which the newly established assemblages captured available resources, i.e. used soil nitrate, absorbed light and produced biomass (vegetative cover). Statistically significant correlations were common between the predictor variables (species number, functional group number, percentage vegetative cover, plant number, presence of idiosyncratic (dominating) species) and responses (soil nitrate concentration, light reduction or ‘extinction’). Higher diversity was associated with lower soil nitrate, while percentage vegetative cover and the presence of idiosyncratic species best predicted light extinction. The relationship between diversity, and plant biomass (measured as vegetative cover) and plant number was positive in the first year of the study. The diversity/biomass relationship became negative in the second year due to the higher numbers and cover of ‘idiosyncratic’ species. The diversity/plant number relationship also became negative in the autumn of the second year and was reduced to a trend by the winter. We found that lower nitrate and increasing plant numbers and vegetative cover were most strongly linked to increasing species number in the early stages of this study. This suggests that introducing and maintaining high diversity early in a native grassland reassembly or enhancement project will improve the resistance (e.g. to weed) of these communities. At later stages of grassland development, this function may be provided by the more dominating idiosyncratic species. The maintenance of diversity, an important goal in its own right, will therefore necessitate managed disturbances to periodically reduce the vegetative dominance of idiosyncratic species, releasing resources for the diverse range of other species whose early introduction will have allowed them to persist in the soil seed bank or as suppressed rootstocks.","Gibson‐Roy, By Paul; Delpratt, John; Moore, Greg; Hepworth, Graham",,50,8

Dispersing beetles were (rapped in light‐reflecting glass traps. Both species are univoltine and breed in the spring. The populations of adult H. brevipalpis are largest during the summer when great numbers emerge and migrate. Very few H. strigifrons adults emerge before spring. Its adult populations are largest in the spring, and small numbers of mature individuals fly with mature H. brevipalpis specimens. This is discussed in relation to their habitat utilization: H. sirigifrons inhabits permanent waters only and is dimorphic for flight musculature. H. brevipalpis inhabits both permanent and ephemeral waters and is always equipped with a functioning flight apparatus. H. brevipalpis is an effective colonizer of ephemeral waters due to its large dispersal capacity and to the fact that the habitat of juveniles differs from that of adults. Age, sexual maturation and feeding in flying and non‐flying groups are compared. Food is seldom found in the gut of fliers of either species. In the spring flying H. brevipalpis females have larger oocytes than non‐flying ones; flying H. strigifrons females have smaller oocytes than non‐fliers. It is possible that the summer migrations of H. brevipalpis favour outbreeding since fliers are sexually immature; spring fliers, being sexually mature, are more efficient as colonizers.","Landin, Jan",Ecography (Cop.),50,8

As at 31 December 1994 the international captive population was 1218 animals of which 880 (72%) were captive‐bred and 338 (28%) were wild‐caught. The steady increase in the captive population is a result of captive breeding, co‐operative captive‐management programmes and importation from the wild. Of facilities holding Cheetah 26%.

We recently reported that factor H binding by B. burgdorferi is due to inducible expression of several approximately 20 kDa plasmid‐encoded, surface‐exposed lipoproteins related to OspE (e.g. ErpA, ErpP and P21). In addition, a second class of factor H‐binding proteins of approximately 27–35 kDa has been described. The OspE‐related lipoproteins are dramatically induced by B. burgdorferi during transmission from its tick vector into the mammalian host. The induction of OspE‐related lipoproteins during mammalian infection may play a key a role in the borrelial evasion of the host's immune system. The goal of the present study was to define the factor H‐binding regions of OspE‐related proteins using mutagenesis, peptide mapping and surface plasmon resonance analysis (Biacore). The combined studies revealed that the C‐terminal regions of both human and mouse factor H (SCRs 18–20) specifically bind to OspE‐related lipoproteins. We also found FHR‐1, whose C‐terminal SCRs 3–5 are homologous to SCRs 18–20 of factor H, to bind to OspE. Peptide mapping revealed five putative regions (designated I‐V) in OspE that could directly interact with factor H. Deleting the C‐terminal 15 amino acid residues from region V of P21 abolished its ability to bind factor H. At the same time, however, synthetic peptides corresponding to the C‐termini of OspE, P21 and ErpP did not inhibit factor H binding to OspE. Thus, the C‐terminal‐binding region V appears to be necessary but not sufficient for factor H binding. When a more specific mutation strategy was employed, where single amino acid residues in peptides spanning over the factor H‐binding regions were mutated to alanines, we observed that lysines in the factor H‐binding regions of OspE were required for factor H binding. The combined data have revealed that key lysine residues in OspE‐related lipoproteins and ionic interactions are crucial for factor H interactions. Furthermore, binding of OspE to the C‐termini of both mouse and human factor H suggests that Borrelia spirochetes utilize analogous complement resistance mechanisms in both rodents and man. In Borrelia garinii strains, which in in vitro analyses have been found to be sensitive to complement killing, differences in the OspE sequences as well as in the expression of factor H‐binding proteins may account for their susceptibility to serum lysis.","Alitalo, A.; Meri, T.; Lankinen, H.; Cheng, Z.‐Z.; Jokiranta, S.; Seppälä, I.; Lahdenne, P.; Brooks, C.; Hefty, P.

Viral cell attachment proteins and target cell receptors,11.439001,7.0963035,2003-03-17,"Immunotherapy represents an attractive fourth‐modality therapeutic approach, especially in the light of the shortcomings of conventional surgery, radiation and chemotherapies in the management of metastatic cancer. To this end, a large number of peptide antigens derived from TAA have been applied in immunotherapeutic trials for the treatment of various malignancies, e.g. cancers of the breast, prostate and kidney, in addition to haematological cancers. In some cases the response rates have been impressive and no adverse autoimmunity have been observed. A major strategic difficulty associated with these trials relates to the choice of best‐suited peptide antigens. The vast majority of the antigens described thus far is not vital for survival and growth of the tumour cells, and immunoselection of antigen‐loss variants may therefore prove to be an additional obstacle for the clinical applicability of most of the known peptide epitopes. In this respect, the development of acquired antigen loss during immunotherapy has been demonstrated in several cases. Obviously, the development of loss‐variant tumour cells implies that these cells acquire a pronounced growth advantage and are left unaffected by further treatment. Ideally, target antigens should be derived from proteins required for survival and growth of tumour cells, as antigens with these characteristics would not be inflicted by the development of loss‐variant tumour cells. In this respect, several inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are universally expressed among tumours and play an important role in tumour cell escape from apoptosis. We have characterized spontaneous T‐cell reactivity against IAP‐derived peptides in cancer patients. From the IAP survivin, we have characterized peptides restricted to the Class I molecules HLA‐A1, A2, A3, A11, B7 and B35. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that survivin‐specific T cells infiltrate metastatic lesions and that isolated survivin‐specific CTLs are capable of killing HLA‐matched tumour cells.

DCs are present in the gut mucosa and may thus be target for modulation by gut microbes, including ingested probiotics. Here, we tested the hypothesis that species of lactic acid bacteria, important members of the gut flora, differentially activate DC. A large panel of human gut‐derived Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium spp. was screened for DC‐polarizing capacity by exposing bone marrow‐derived murine DC to lethally irradiated bacteria. Cytokines in culture supernatants and DC‐surface maturation markers were analysed. Substantial differences were found among strains in the capacity to induce interleukin‐12 (IL‐12) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)‐α, while the differences for IL‐10 and IL‐6 were less pronounced. Bifidobacteria tended to be weak IL‐12 and TNF‐α inducers, while both strong and weak IL‐12 inducers were found among the strains of Lactobacillus. Remarkably, strains weak in IL‐12 induction inhibited IL‐12 and TNF‐α production induced by an otherwise strong cytokine‐inducing strain of Lactobacillus casei, while IL‐10 production remained unaltered. Selected strains were tested for induction of DC maturation markers. Those lactobacilli with greatest capacity to induce IL‐12 were most effective in upregulating surface MHC class II and CD86. Moreover, L. casei‐induced upregulation of CD86 was reduced in the presence of a weak IL‐12‐inducing L. reuteri. In conclusion, human Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium spp. polarize differentially DC maturation. Thus, the potential exists for Th1/Th2/Treg‐driving capacities of the gut DC to be modulated according to composition of gut flora including ingested probiotics.","Chistensen, H.

Healthcare professionals working in hospitals and healthcare facilities are more likely to be subjected to these hazards than their counterparts working in other areas. OBJECTIVES: This review aims to assess current research literature regarding this situation with a view to informing policy makers and practitioners about the risks of exposure and offer evidence-based recommendations on how to eliminate or reduce such risks. METHODS: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses review strategy, we conducted a systematic review of studies related to occupational health and safety conducted between January 2000 and January 2019 using MEDLINE (Ovid), PubMed, PMC, TOXLINE, CINAHL, PLOS One, and Access Pharmacy databases. RESULTS: The review detected 490 studies addressing the issue of occupational health and safety hazards; of these, 30 articles were included in this systematic review. These articles reported a variety of exposures faced by healthcare professionals. This review also revealed a number of strategies that can be adopted to control, eliminate, or reduce hazards to healthcare professionals in Taiwan. CONCLUSION: Hospitals and healthcare facilities have many unique occupational health and safety hazards that can potentially affect the health and performance of healthcare professionals. The impact of such hazards on healthcare professionals poses a serious public health issue in Taiwan; therefore, controlling, eliminating, or reducing exposure can contribute to a stronger healthcare workforce with great potential to improve patient care and the healthcare system in Taiwan. Eliminating or reducing hazards can best be achieved through engineering measures, administrative policy, and the use of personal protective equipment. IMPLICATIONS: This review has research, policy, and practice implications and provides future students and researchers with information on systematic review methodologies based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses strategy. It also identifies occupational health and safety risks and provides insights and strategies to address them.","Che Huei, Lin; Ya-Wen, Lin; Chiu Ming, Yang; Li Chen, Hung; Jong Yi, Wang; Ming Hung, Lin",SAGE Open Med,50,22

They employ third-party APIs to serve end-users via natural language interactions. Chatbots are famed for their easy-to-use interface and gentle learning curve (it only requires one of humans’ most innate ability, the use of natural language). Studies on human conversation patterns show, however, that day-to-day dialogues are of multi-turn and multi-intent nature, which pushes the need for chatbots that are more resilient and flexible to this style of conversations. In this paper, we propose the idea of leveraging Conversational State Machine to make it a core part of chatbots’ conversation engine by formulating conversations as a sequence of states. Here, each state covers an intent and contains a nested state machine to help manage tasks associated to the conversation intent. Such enhanced conversation engine, together with a novel technique to spot implicit information from dialogues (by exploiting Dialog Acts), allows chatbots to manage tangled conversation situations where most existing chatbot technologies fail.","Zamanirad, Shayan; Benatallah, Boualem; Rodriguez, Carlos; Yaghoubzadehfard, Mohammadali; Bouguelia, Sara; Brabra, Hayet",Advanced Information Systems Engineering,50,28

The numerous toolkits result in a problem on NLP library selection. The selection of NLP library in current work commonly misses some objective reasons, which may pose threats to validity. And it is also not clear that whether the existing guideline on selection still works for the latest versions. In this work, we propose a solution for NLP library selection when the effectiveness is unknown. We use the NLP libraries together in a combined method. Our combined method can utilize the strengths of different NLP libraries to obtain accurate results. The combination is conducted through two steps, i.e., document-level selection of NLP library and sentence-level overwriting. In document-level selection of primary library, the results are obtained from the library that has the highest overall accuracy. Through sentence-level overwriting, the possible fine-gained improvements from other libraries are extracted to overwrite the outputs of primary library. We evaluate the combined method with 4 widely used NLP libraries and 200 documents from 3 different sources. The results show that the combined method can generally outperform all the studied NLP libraries in terms of accuracy. The finding means that our combined method can be used instead of individual NLP library for more effective results.","Cheng, Xinyun; Kong, Xianglong; Liao, Li; Li, Bixin",Advanced Information Systems Engineering,50,1

The main contribution of this study is to apply this idea to verification of super learner. We compare the new method with other verification methods, including nested cross validation. Tests were performed on artificial data sets of diverse size and on seven real, biomedical data sets. The resampling method, called Bootstrap Bias Correction, proved to be a reasonably precise and very cost-efficient alternative for nested cross validation.","Mnich, Krzysztof; Kitlas Golińska, Agnieszka; Polewko-Klim, Aneta; Rudnicki, Witold R.",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,50,1

As a traditional Chinese medicine, Kai-Xin-San (KXS) has been widely used for the treatment of emotion-related disorders. In the present study, we aimed to explore whether KXS had both antidepressive effects and cardioprotective functions in a rat model of myocardial ischemia (MI) with depression. METHODS: A total of 50 SD rats were randomly assigned into five groups as follows: normal control (control group), celiac injection of isopropyl adrenaline (ISO) (MI group), depression (depression group), MI+ depression (model group) and MI+ depression treated with intragastric administration of 370 mg/kg KXS (KXS group). MI was induced by subcutaneous injection of 85 mg/kg ISO. Depression was developed by a 7-week chronic mild stress (CMS) challenge. Behavioral test was conducted before and during the experiment. Echocardiography and biochemical analysis were carried out after 7 weeks of CMS challenge. RESULTS: After 7 weeks of experiment, depression-like behaviors were observed in all the groups except for control and KXS groups, and KXS treatment dramatically increased open-field test scores and sucrose consumption (P < 0.01 vs. model group). Echocardiography and biochemical analysis showed that KXS treatment could improve levels of ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS), which were reduced by depression and ISO challenge. Meanwhile, KXS treatment significantly decreased the levels of creation kinase MB (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which were increased in the model group. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), catalase (CAT) were increased, while the malondialdehyde (MDA) activity was significantly decreased in the KXS group. Moreover, KXS treatment reduced the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in myocardial tissue compared with the model group. CONCLUSIONS: KXS had antidepressant-like activity and offered cardioprotective effects against ISO-induced myocardial infarction with depression.","Hu, Yuan; Liu, Xu; Zhang, Tianyi; Chen, Chao; Dong, Xianzhe; Can, Yan; Liu, Ping",Front Pharmacol,50,1

Here, first insights provided by genetics over the last two decades, such as dysfunction of molecular and organellar quality control, are described. The mechanisms involved relate to impaired intracellular calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial dynamics, which are tightly linked to the cross talk between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. A number of proteins related to monogenic forms of PD have been mapped to these pathways, i.e., PINK1, Parkin, LRRK2, and α-synuclein. Recently, Miro1 was identified as an important player, as several studies linked Miro1 to mitochondrial quality control by PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy and mitochondrial transport. Moreover, Miro1 is an important regulator of mitochondria-ER contact sites (MERCs), where it acts as a sensor for cytosolic calcium levels. The involvement of Miro1 in the pathogenesis of PD was recently confirmed by genetic evidence based on the first PD patients with heterozygous mutations in RHOT1/Miro1. Patient-based cellular models from RHOT1/Miro1 mutation carriers showed impaired calcium homeostasis, structural alterations of MERCs, and increased mitochondrial clearance. To account for the emerging role of Miro1, we present a comprehensive overview focusing on the role of this protein in PD-related neurodegeneration and highlighting new developments in our understanding of Miro1, which provide new avenues for neuroprotective therapies for PD patients.","Grossmann, Dajana; Berenguer-Escuder, Clara; Chemla, Axel; Arena, Giuseppe; Krüger, Rejko",Front Neurol,50,1

Domiciliary ventilators which entrain room air have been widely used during the pandemic. Poor outcomes reported with non-invasive respiratory support using ventilators which lack an oxygen blender could be related to an unreliable Fraction of inspired O(2) (FiO(2)). Additionally, with concerns about oxygen failure, the variety of ventilator circuits used as well as differing peak inspiratory flow rates (PIFR) could impact on the FiO(2) delivered during therapy with domiciliary ventilators. METHODS: In a series of bench tests, we tested the effect of choice of circuit and different PIFR on the FiO(2) achieved during simulation of ventilation and CPAP therapy using domiciliary ventilators. RESULTS: FiO(2) was highly dependent upon the type of circuit used with circuits with an active exhalation valve achieving similar FiO(2) at lower oxygen flow rates than circuits using an exhalation port. During CPAP therapy, high PIFR resulted in significantly lower FiO(2) than low PIFR. CONCLUSIONS: This study has implications for oxygen usage as well as delivery of non-invasive respiratory support during therapy with domiciliary ventilators when these are used during the second wave of COVID-19.","Messer, Ben; Tedd, Hilary; Doris, Tom; Mountain, Andrew; Gatilogo, Cris; Sovani, Milind",J Intensive Care Soc,50,1

Genome plasticity has given rise to a wide range of strain variation with respect to antimicrobial resistance profiles and expression of virulence factors which lead to altered phenotypes associated with pathogenesis. The purpose of this study was to analyze clinical strains of A. baumannii for phenotypic variation that might correlate with virulence phenotypes, antimicrobial resistance patterns, or strain isolation source. We hypothesized that individual strain virulence phenotypes might be associated with anatomical site of isolation or alterations in susceptibility to antimicrobial interventions. METHODOLOGY: A cohort of 17 clinical isolates of A. baumannii isolated from diverse anatomical sites were evaluated to ascertain phenotypic patterns including biofilm formation, hemolysis, motility, and antimicrobial resistance. Antibiotic susceptibility/resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam, amikacin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, cefepime, gentamicin, levofloxacin, meropenem, piperacillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ticarcillin- K clavulanate, tetracyclin, and tobramycin was determined. RESULTS: Antibiotic resistance was prevalent in many strains including resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam, amikacin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, cefepime, gentamicin, levofloxacin, meropenem, piperacillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ticarcillin- K clavulanate, tetracyclin, and tobramycin. All strains tested induced hemolysis on agar plate detection assays. Wound-isolated strains of A. baumannii exhibited higher motility than strains isolated from blood, urine or Foley catheter, or sputum/bronchial wash. A. baumannii strains isolated from patient blood samples formed significantly more biofilm than isolates from wounds, sputum or bronchial wash samples. An inverse relationship between motility and biofilm formation was observed in the cohort of 17 clinical isolates of A. baumannii tested in this study. Motility was also inversely correlated with induction of hemolysis. An inverse correlation was observed between hemolysis and resistance to ticarcillin-k clavulanate, meropenem, and piperacillin. An inverse correlation was also observed between motility and resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam, ceftriaxone, ceftoxamine, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: Strain dependent variations in biofilm and motility are associated with anatomical site of isolation. Biofilm and hemolysis production both have an inverse association with motility in the cohort of strains utilized in this study, and motility and hemolysis were inversely correlated with resistance to numerous antibiotics.

The results of these responses have fallen in the range between useful and counterproductive, with many examples on each side, but the scale of the overall challenge continues to escalate. Moving towards a zero-carbon global economy through absolute reductions in fossil fuel usage is a sure way of mitigating climate change, and a range of environmental, social and economic benefits would follow. The case for a Circular Economy (CE), however, is less clear. Whilst some CE initiatives may lead to the decoupling of economic growth from resource extraction, this does not necessarily equate to reducing the rate of extraction. Thus, the contribution of CE to the achievement of environmental objectives globally cannot be taken for granted. In terms of social impact, the best that can be said is that CE might be neutral. Technologies that promote the ‘sharing economy’ for instance, often suggested as a crucial CE strategy, create opportunities for individual wealth accumulation, but are also a route to the gig economy and the casualisation of labour. CE is arguably a business imperative, but definitive evidence to support the idea of a circular economy that meets social and environmental goals needs development.","Hart, Jim; Pomponi, Francesco",Circ.Econ.Sust.,50,1

The results of the algorithms are label’s triplets for each topic, after which we carried out a two-step evaluation procedure of the algorithms’ results: at the first stage, two experts assessed the triplet’s relevance to the topic on a 3-value scale (non-conformity to the topic/partial compliance to the topic/full compliance to the topic), second, we carried out evaluation of single labels by 10 assessors who were asked to mark each label by weights «0» – a label doesn’t match a topic; «1» – a label matches a topic. Our experiments show that in most cases Labels-Yandex algorithm predicts correct labels but frequently relates the topic to a label that is relevant to the current moment, but not to a set of keywords, while Labels-ESA works out labels with generalized content. Thus, a combination of these methods will make it possible to markup e-hypertext topics and create a semantic network theory of e-hypertext.","Mitrofanova, Olga; Kriukova, Anna; Shulginov, Valery; Shulginov, Vadim","Recent Trends in Analysis of Images, Social Networks and Texts",50,30

METHODS: 285 cases OVER A 1-MONTH PERIOD were RETROSPECTIVELY reviewed to evaluate the effectiveness of managing patients using the ‘one-stop’ model and the new Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC). RESULTS: 277 patients were included in the study. During Covid-19, operative cases fell by 62%. 86.3% (239/277) of cases were managed in the UTC; 54.4% (130/239) required conservative management and 45.6% (109/239) required minor procedures (in UTC).

A patient education video: ‘softcast removal at home’ was created and in cases requiring sutures, 95.1% (39/41) were absorbable, thereby avoiding COVID-19 exposure for follow-up. Only 50.5% (140/277) of patients had formal follow-up arranged and patient information follow-up cards were developed.

This study used a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory approach to identify the criteria affecting the performance of Taiwan wealth management banks during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) period. This research surveyed 17 executives from Taiwanese banks using 13 criteria covering three dimensions: bank performance, professionalism, and customer relationship. The results indicated that customer relationship and professionalism have an influence on key performance. Customer involvement (in customer relationship), innovative products and services (in professionalism), and customer satisfaction (in key performance) are the most influential criteria. The results suggest that banks can attract and retain customers by increasing their uses of products and services, developing innovative products, and improving customer satisfaction despite the negative effect of COVID-19. The findings of this study benefit wealth management bank managers in sustaining fee and commission income from high-net-worth customers in the midst of adverse social and economic events.","Lin, Arthur J.; Chang, Hai-Yen; Huang, Sun-Weng; Tzeng, Gwo-Hshiung",J Financ Serv Mark,50,1

The purpose of this study was to assess the diet quality of college freshmen and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Freshman students 18 years or older in all majors in a southeastern university were invited to take the Diet History Questionnaire III (DHQ III) in fall 2019 and in fall 2020. The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scores from the participants were obtained and compared to the HEI-2015 national averages through one-sample t-tests. RESULTS: Thirty students in fall 2019 cohort (86.7% female, 46.7% white) and 55 students in fall 2020 cohort (78.2% female, 63.5% white) completed the survey. Compared to national average data, participants in the current study had higher total HEI scores (60.9 vs. 58.3, P < 0.05), higher total fruits scores (3.8 vs. 2.6, P < 0.001), higher dairy scores (6.4 vs. 5.4, P < 0.001), but lower total protein scores (4.1 vs. 5.0, P < 0.001), lower seafood and plant protein scores (3.6 vs. 5.0, P < 0.001), higher refined grains scores (8.0 vs. 6.7, P < 0.001), and higher sodium scores (4.7 vs. 3.4, P < 0.001). Just examining the 2020 cohort of students, after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall HEI scores were lower and not significantly different from the national average (P > 0.05) and HEI fatty acids scores were lower (3.7 vs. 4.5, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The diet quality of freshman college students remains inadequate and interventions are needed to prevent or postpone the health problems especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Selenoprotein S is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane associated selenoprotein that is involved in protein degradation and NFκβ signaling. It also contributes to reducing proinflammatory cytokines TNF‐α, IL‐1β and IL‐6. Selenoprotein S is known to interact with SARS‐CoV‐2 non‐structural protein (nsp7), which is part of the virus replication machine. However, it is not clear whether they interact directly and whether selenoprotein S can still bind nsp7 once it is in complex with the virus’ replication machinery. The role of selenoprotein S in the replication complex is unknown. We used biochemical assays to investigate these open questions and to identify which segment of selenoprotein S is involved in the interaction and which segment is free to recruit other human or viral proteins. We show that selenoprotein S binds tightly and directly to nsp7. Selenoprotein S is a membrane protein and its hydrophobic region is the main segment involved in binding nsp7. The soluble cytosolic segment cannot bind to nsp7. Therefore, it is free for binding to other protein partners. In addition, selenoprotein S was able to bind the nsp7 and nsp8 complex suggesting that it can bind the core replication complex directly. Thus, we suggest that selenoprotein S is a component of the virus core replication complex and may be responsible for recruiting other human proteins to the replication complex.","Ghelichkhani, Farid; Cheng, Rujin; Gonzalez‐Arias, Fabio; Rozovsky, Sharon",FASEB J,50,8

Meanwhile, local patient isolates were also selected to confirm the epidemiological links. Bacterial community composition analyses of the sediments that were sampled in 2015 and 2017 were conducted by the hypervariable region 4 of the 16S rRNA gene. Together with the local clinical isolates, we observed highly related Vibrio isolates from waterbirds, wetlands and shrimp. Phylogenetic genome comparisons also demonstrated that sequence types ST3 and ST2414 Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolates obtained from aquatic animals were clonally related to patient isolates. Likewise, three Salmonella typhimurium isolates were also genomically related to one clinical strain. The results showed that farming activities significantly altered the community composition and resulted in the emergence of several pathogens, including Acinetobacter, Mycobacterium and Legionella. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our results demonstrated that intensive shrimp farming in wetlands has two devastating impacts: pathogen dissemination from aquatic animals into migratory birds and transmission of foodborne pathogens into local communities.

With the benefit of more data, our understanding of the training-performance puzzle has improved. What were we thinking 20 years ago, and how has our thinking changed over time? Although early investigators attributed overuse injuries to excessive training loads, it has become clear that rapid spikes in training load, above what an athlete is accustomed, explain (at least in part) a large proportion of injuries. In this respect, it appears that overuse injuries may arise from athletes being underprepared for the load they are about to perform. However, a question of interest to both athletic trainers (ATs) and researchers is why some athletes sustain injury at low training loads, while others can tolerate much greater training loads? A higher chronic training load and well-developed aerobic fitness and lower body strength appear to moderate the training-injury relationship and provide a protective effect against spikes in load. The training-performance puzzle is complex and dynamic-at any given time, multiple inputs to injury and performance exist. The challenge facing researchers is obtaining large enough longitudinal data sets to capture the time-varying nature of physiological and musculoskeletal capacities and training-load data to adequately inform injury-prevention efforts. The training-performance puzzle can be solved, but it will take collaboration between researchers and clinicians as well as an understanding that efficacy (ie, how training load affects performance and injury in an idealized or controlled setting) does not equate to effectiveness (ie, how training load affects performance and injury in the real-world setting, where many variables cannot be controlled).","Gabbett, Tim J",Journal of athletic training,50,1

In Indonesia, too, this figure has risen with Indonesia ranked amongst ten countries with the highest rates of child marriage in the world. One of the Indonesian provinces with a high incidence of child marriage cases is in Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB). OBJECTIVE This study aims to examine what is causing the rate of child marriages to increase since the outbreak of COVID-19 in NTB. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING Using snowball sampling techniques, the researcher selected 23 study participants, including ten parents (seven mothers and three fathers) with children who were married underage and 13 adolescents aged 14 to 17 years old (ten females and three males) who were married between March and December 2020. They came from two different regencies of NTB: Lombok Barat and Lombok Utara. METHODS This study employed qualitative phenomenology as the method of inquiry. Data was obtained through semi-structured in-depth interviews and analyzed in a two-stage coding model. The results of the analysis were asserted on phenomenological themes. RESULTS The data reveals that teenagers get married because: 1) they believe that marriage is an escape-from schoolwork, house chores, and the stress and boredom of studying and staying at home during the pandemic; 2) the customary law- some local customs encourage or permit child marriage; 3) there is a lack of understanding of the impact and long term implications of underage marriage; 4) economic problems- financial problems trigger parents to marry their children at a young age; and 5) the influence of the surrounding environment and peers, which encourages early marriage. CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest a number of recommendations for the prevention of child marriage: 1) socializing the prevention of child marriage; 2) offering alternative activities and support systems for adolescents to overcome frustration and pressure due to online learning and staying at home; 3) changing society's view that marrying children solves adolescent promiscuity, prevents pregnancy, and addresses the issue of non-marital pregnancy.","Rahiem, Maila D H",Child abuse & neglect,50,11

Male counterparts are responsible for about half of the infertility cases, and genitourinary tract infections may play a contributing role in approximately 15% of male infertility cases. Leukocytospermia is an established indicator of infection in the male urogenital tract, although other microorganisms such as bacteria and virus may also be contributors to the etiology of male infertility. The pathophysiology of these infectious agents may be initiated by a local inflammatory reaction resulting in an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). This results in testicular injury, thereby affecting sperm morphology, sperm motility, sperm viability and elevation of the seminal leukocyte as a result of the genital tract infection. The infectious and inflammatory changes can result in male infertility. It is proposed that high concentrations of seminal leukocyte and infectious agents may affect sperm function resulting in clumping of motile spermatozoa, decreasing acrosomal functionality and also causing alterations in sperm morphology. However, the literature has poorly clarified the role of infection in male infertility, provoking further debate and research on this topic.","Henkel, Ralf; Offor, Ugochukwu; Fisher, David",Andrologia,50,16

We analyzed ophthalmic consequences due to coverage of the origin of the ophthalmic artery by flow-diverting stents for the treatment of internal carotid artery aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS From April 2009 to April 2013, the clinical and angiographic outcomes of all 28 patients treated for aneurysms with flow-diverting stents covering the origin of the ophthalmic artery were prospectively collected. The origin of the ophthalmic artery in relation to the target aneurysm was classified by using a 4-type classification. A complete ophthalmic examination was performed by a single ophthalmologist 48 hours before and 1 week after covering the ophthalmic artery. RESULTS Ophthalmic artery patency was normal at the end of endovascular treatment in 24/28 cases (85.7%). With extensive ophthalmic examinations, 11 patients (39.3%) showed new ophthalmic complications. Patients with the ophthalmic artery originating from the aneurysm sac were at high risk for retinal emboli (4/5, 80%). Patients with the ophthalmic artery originating from the inner curve of the carotid siphon were at high risk for optic nerve ischemic atrophy (3/4, 75%). CONCLUSIONS This prospective study shows that covering the ophthalmic artery with a flow-diverting stent is not without potential complications. Ophthalmic complications can occur but are often not diagnosed. The anatomic disposition of the ophthalmic artery in relation to the carotid siphon and aneurysm should be clearly understood because some configurations have a higher risk. When not required, covering of the ophthalmic artery by flow-diverting stents should be avoided.","Rouchaud, A; Leclerc, O; Benayoun, Y; Saleme, S; Camilleri, Y; D'Argento, F; Boncoeur, M-P; Robert, P-Y; Mounayer, C",AJNR.

This study examined whether head and thorax elevation post-ROSC is beneficial, in a porcine model. METHODS Protocol A: 40 kg anesthetized pigs were positioned flat, after 7.75 minutes of untreated CA the heart and head were elevated 8 and 12 cm, respectively, above the horizontal plane, automated active compression decompression (ACD) plus impedance threshold device (ITD) CPR was started, and 2 minutes later the heart and head were elevated 10 and 22 cm, respectively, over 2 minutes to the highest head up position (HUP). After 30 minutes of CPR pigs were defibrillated and randomized 10 minutes later to four 5-minutes epochs of HUP or flat position. Multiple physiological parameters were measured. In Protocol B, after 6 minutes of untreated VF, pigs received 6 minutes of conventional CPR flat, and after ROSC were randomized HUP versus Flat as in Protocol A. The primary endpoint was cerebral perfusion pressure (CerPP). Multivariate analysis-of-variance (MANOVA) for repeated measures was used. Data were reported as mean ± SD. RESULTS In Protocol A, intracranial pressure (ICP) (mmHg) was significantly lower post-ROSC with HUP (9.1 ± 5.5) versus Flat (18.5 ± 5.1) (p < 0.001). Conversely, CerPP was higher with HUP (62.5 ± 19.9) versus Flat (53.2 ± 19.1) (p = 0.004), respectively. Protocol A and B results comparing HUP versus Flat were similar. CONCLUSION Post-ROSC head and thorax elevation in a porcine model of cardiac arrest resulted in higher CerPP and lower ICP values, regardless of VF duration or CPR method.

The aim of this study is to assess the effect of concomitant HHR on postoperative GERD symptoms in our patient population. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review of patients who underwent LSG with or without HHR between 2011and 2014 was performed. Pre- and postoperative GERD symptoms were assessed at different time intervals until a maximum of 2 years after the surgery. RESULTS The study included 165 patients; 76 (46%) underwent LSG with concomitant HHR (group A) while the rest underwent only LSG (group B). Baseline GERD complaints were more prevalent in group A (61.8 vs 41.6%, p = 0.04), in which 44 patients (57.9%) had evidence of hiatal hernia on preoperative EGD. In the remaining 32 patients, it was diagnosed intraoperatively. GERD symptoms did not significantly differ between the two groups after years 1 and 2. GERD remission was observed in 21.3% of the 76 patients who underwent concomitant HHR (group A) and in 29.7% of those who did not (group B) while new-onset GERD symptoms were reported in 12 patients (41.4%) in group A and in 24 patients (46.2%) in group B. CONCLUSIONS Routine HHR at the time of LSG does not show an improvement in GERD symptoms. More prospective studies are needed to clarify the role of the routine dissection, identification, and repair of concomitant hiatal hernia during LSG.","Dakour Aridi, Hanaa; Asali, Mohammad; Fouani, Tarek; Alami, Ramzi S; Safadi, Bassem Y",Obesity surgery,50,1

The inclusion of post-mortem studies to diagnose the infection causing mortality could be beneficial in specifying new pathogens and determining strategies for treatment and prevention. The aim of this study was to research viral etiology by applying multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (Rt-PCR) method in autopsy cases who have been considered to have a respiratory infection and to assess whether the viruses detected are the primary cause of the infection and whether they have any contributory effect on the mortality together with histopathological evidence. In this study, we included a total of 834 cases consisting of sudden death cases from infantile-pediatric age group and autopsy cases from > 18 year age group with suspected respiratory tract infection in our laboratory between January 2013 and May 2017. Of 834 cases, 468 (56.1%) were male and 366 (43.9%) were female, there were 191 (22.9%) cases between 0-1 months, 593 (71.1%) cases between 1 month-18 years, and 50 (6%) cases in the > 18 years age group. In 728 of 834 (87.3%) cases nasopharyngeal/tracheal swab samples and in 106 (12.7%) of them paraffin-embedded lung tissue samples were studied by the use of ""FTD Respiratory 21 (Fast-Tract Diagnostics Luxemburg)"" kit, with multiplex Rt-PCR method. The post-mortem samples were evaluated for human rhinovirus (HRV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV) (1, 2, 3, 4), influenza virus type A and B (INF-A, INF-B), enterovirus (EV), human bocavirus (HBoV), adenovirus (AdV), human coronavirus (HCoV 229,63,HKU,43), human metapneumovirus A ve B (HMPV-A/B), parechovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV A/B) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In our study, at least one respiratory virus was detected by Rt-PCR in 379 (45.4%) of total 834 cases, whereas no viral agent was identified in 455 (54.6%) of the cases. One viral agent was detected in 278 (33.3%), two viral agents were detected in 83 (9.94%) and three viral agents were detected in 18 (2.16%) cases. Overall, the most common viral agent was HRV 110 (13.2%) followed by AdV 39 (4.7%) and RSV A/B 33 (4%). In pediatric cases the rate of positive results for respiratory viruses was 31.8% and in adult group it was 20% (p= 0.032). The most common virus detected among children was HRV and INF-A in adult group. In 101 (12.1%) cases infections caused by two or three agents were diagnosed. Infections with two causative agents were detected as 2.6% (5/191) in 0-1 month age group, 13% (77/593) in 1 month-18 year age group and 2% (1/50) in > 18 age group. The most frequently observed co-infections with double causative agents were HRV and INF-B, HRV and PIV, HRV and HBoV, HRV and AdV combinations. Infections with three causative agents were detected completely among 1 month-18 year age [3% (18/593)] group. In our study, 318 (38.1%) cases had no signs of infection in the postmortem histopathological examination of the lung tissues, while the most common finding was lobular pneumonia/purulent bronchitis in 233 (28%) cases and the second was interstitial pneumonia in 168 (20.1%) cases. When all cases were evaluated in terms of infection, positive results were detected in 469 (56.2%) cases. As a result; postmortem microbiological diagnosis with autopsy and histopathological detection of the patients who are thought to have respiratory tract infection will also determine the infectious agents causing death.","Ziyade, Nihan; Elgörmüş, Neval; Kara, Erdoğan; Karayel, Ferah",Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,50,12

However, the availability of this support is limited by a constellation of barriers, including race, culture, socioeconomic status, and geography. RESEARCH AIMS To identify the geodemographic composition of communities where breastfeeding support was available from the mother-to-mother support organizations Breastfeeding USA and La Leche League, identify underlying issues of equity, and highlight locations where more support resources may be needed. METHODS The locations of mother-to-mother support meetings were collected by ZIP code (N = 180) and were combined with a geodemographic database and exploratory spatial data analysis to explore the compositional characteristics of communities served (N = 1,173). RESULTS Significant gaps in the geographic distribution of breastfeeding support existed. While many metropolitan areas benefited from numerous mother-to-mother support groups and peer counselors, the geographic footprint of this support favored communities that were white, affluent, and suburban. CONCLUSION Spatial analytics combined with geodemographic analysis provide a unique perspective into the diverse landscape of mother-to-mother breastfeeding support groups at a local level. Our results highlighted inequities in the distribution of support provided and prescriptive guidance regarding where more resources may be needed.","Grubesic, Tony H; Durbin, Kelly M",Journal of human lactation : official journal of International Lactation Consultant Association,50,1

By applying a socio-ecological framework with an equity lens, we aim to provide an overview of the health of children in immigrant families (CIF) in the U.S., identify gaps in related research, and suggest future areas of focus to advance health equity. METHODS The literature review consisted of identifying academic and gray literature using a MeSH Database, Clinical Queries, and relevant keywords in three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and BrowZine). Search terms were selected with goals of: 1) conceptualizing a model to of key drivers of health for CIF; 2) describing and classifying key drivers of health for CIF; and 3) identifying knowledge gaps. RESULTS The initial search produced 1,120 results which were screened for relevance using a meta-narrative approach. Of these, 224 papers were selected, categorized by topic, and reviewed in collaboration with the authors. Key topic areas included patient and family outcomes, institutional and community environments, the impact of public policy, and opportunities for research. Key inequities were identified in health outcomes; access to quality health care, housing, education, employment opportunities; immigration policies; and inclusion in and funding for research. Important resiliency factors for CIF included strong family connections and social networks. CONCLUSIONS Broad structural inequities contribute to poor health outcomes among immigrant families. While resiliency factors exist, research on the impact of certain important drivers of health, such as structural and cultural racism, is missing regarding this population. More work is needed to inform the development and optimization of programs and policies aimed at improving outcomes for CIF. However, research should incorporate expertise from within immigrant communities. Finally, interventions to improve outcomes for CIF should be considered in the context of the socio-ecological model which informs the upstream and downstream drivers of health outcomes.","Ayalew, Betlihem; Dawson-Hahn, Elizabeth; Cholera, Rushina; Falusi, Olanrewaju; Haro, Tamar Magarik; Montoya-Williams, Diana; Linton, Julie M",Academic pediatrics,50,1

Since this approach is potentially patient dependent, we investigated whether convolutional neural networks (CNNs) could achieve better performances without the need for contralateral hemisphere thresholds. Approach: CTP and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data were retrospectively collected for 63 AIS patients. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), time-to-peak, mean-transit-time (MTT), and delay time maps were generated using Vitrea CTP software. U-net shaped CNNs were developed, trained, and tested for 26 different input CTP parameter combinations. Infarct labels were segmented from DWI volumes registered with CTP volumes. Infarct volumes were reconstructed from two-dimensional CTP infarct segmentations. To remove erroneous segmentations, conditional random field (CRF) postprocessing was applied and compared with prior results. Spatial and volumetric infarct agreement was assessed between DWI and CTP (CNNs and commercial software) using median infarct difference, median absolute error, dice coefficient, positive predictive value. Results: The most accurate combination of parameters for CNN segmenting infarct using CRF postprocessing was CBF, CBV, and MTT (4.83 mL, 10.14 mL, 0.66, 0.73). Commercial software results are: RAPID = (2.25 mL, 21.48 mL, 0.63, 0.70), Sphere = (7.57 mL, 17.74 mL, 0.64, 0.70), Vitrea = (6.79 mL, 15.28 mL, 0.63, 0.72). Conclusions: Use of CNNs with multiple input perfusion parameters has shown to be accurate in segmenting infarcts and has the ability to improve clinical workflow by eliminating the need for contralateral hemisphere comparisons.","Rava, Ryan A; Podgorsak, Alexander R; Waqas, Muhammad; Snyder, Kenneth V; Mokin, Maxim; Levy, Elad I; Davies, Jason M; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Ionita, Ciprian N",Journal of medical imaging,50,6

However, to develop a next-generation wearable tactile sensor, it is necessary to implement an interactive display that responds immediately to external stimuli. Herein, a wearable and semitransparent pressure-sensitive light-emitting sensor (PLS) based on electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is successfully implemented with visual alarm functions to prevent damage to the human body from external stimuli. The PLS is fabricated with a very simple structure using the ECL gel as the light-emitting layer and a carbon nanotube embedded polydimethylsiloxane as the electrode. The ECL light-emitting layer using a redox reaction is advantageous for the fabrication of next-generation wearable devices due to the advantages of a simple structure, the use of electrodes without work function limitation. The PLS can display various external stimuli immediately and operate at a high luminance, making it safe to use as a wearable sensor. Therefore, the PLS using ECL can be a simple and meaningful solution for the next-generation wearable tactile sensors.","Kwon, Do Kyun; Myoung, Jae-Min",ACS nano,50,24

This study aimed to develop the radiomics models as the potential biomarkers to estimate the overall survival (OS) for the COVID-19 severe patients. A total of 74 COVID-19 severe patients were enrolled in this study, and 30 of them died during the follow-up period. First, the clinical risk factors of the patients were analyzed. Then, two radiomics signatures were constructed based on two segmented volumes of interest (VOIs) of whole lung area and lesion area. Two combination models were built depend on whether the clinic risk factors were used and/or whether two radiomics signatures were combined. Kaplan-Meier analysis were performed for validating two radiomics signatures and C-index was used to evaluated the predictive performance of all radiomics signatures and combination models. Finally, a radiomics nomogram combining radiomics signatures with clinical risk factors was developed for predicting personalized OS, and then assessed with respect to the calibration curve. Three clinical risk factors were found, included age, malignancy and highest temperature that influence OS. Both two radiomics signatures could effectively stratify the risk of OS in COVID-19 severe patients. The predictive performance of the combination model with 2 radiomics signatures was better than that only one radiomics signature was used, and became better when 3 clinical risk factors were interpolated. Calibration curves showed good agreement in both 15-days survival and 30-days survival between the estimation with the constructed nomogram and actual observation. Both two constructed radiomics signatures can act as the potential biomarkers for risk stratification of OS in COVID-19 severe patients. The radiomics+clinical nomogram generated might serve as a potential tool to guide personalized treatment and care for these patients.","Xiao, Feng; Sun, Rongqing; Sun, Wenbo; Xu, Dan; Lan, Lan; Li, Huan; Liu, Huan; Xu, Haibo",Physics in medicine and biology,50,16

Lf blocks the early interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host cells by binding to specific cell receptors and has been proposed as a preventative and adjunct treatment for COVID-19. This preliminary report aimed to investigate concentrations of Lf in early milk of SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers versus non-infected controls. MATERIAL AND METHODS In a cohort of 13 SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers and 15 controls, breast milk concentrations of Lf were determined by ELISA on day 3 postpartum. Additionally, colostrum samples of infected mothers were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG determination using RT-qPCR and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS No differences were found in breast milk Lf concentrations between SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers and controls. In a subgroup analysis, however, symptomatic mothers (n = 7) presented with lower breast milk Lf concentrations, as compared to asymptomatic mothers (p = .041) and healthy controls (p = .029). All milk samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Early human milk of infected mothers displayed IgA and IgG SARS-CoV-2 specific reactivity. CONCLUSIONS Our data showed a different early breast milk Lf ""profile"" between COVID-19 symptomatic and asymptomatic mothers with the latter being at non-COVID levels (control group). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in any breast milk sample.

Our goal was to understand the knowledge, beliefs, and experiences of US youth at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We posed 2 open-ended surveys to the national MyVoice text message cohort of youth, aged 14-24 years. On March 6, 2020, 4 questions were asked regarding knowledge and experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic with 3 questions repeated on March 20, 2020. Qualitative responses were coded using thematic analysis and summarized with descriptive statistics. RESULTS Of 1,174 youth, 1,087 responded to at least 1 question (response rate of 88%). The average age of respondents was 19 (SD 2.8) years with 52% female and 56% non-Hispanic White respondents. On March 6, 2020, most (70%) respondents reported knowing about COVID-19 and primarily cited the news (46%) as their source of information. Nearly all (95%) respondents reported impact by March 20, 2020, and respondents expressing worry increased from 25% to 51%. In both surveys, worried youth primarily cited concern for others (26% and 34%). Regarding preparation, respondents primarily reported doing nothing (36%) on March 6, 2020, and practicing social distancing (50%) on March 20, 2020. CONCLUSIONS Many youths in our sample are engaged with the COVID-19 pandemic and most are feeling knowledgeable, are concerned about its impacts on others, and are practicing social distancing. Sustained public health efforts should focus on maintaining youth engagement with accurate public information and youth-centered messaging promoting prevention measures to protect the health and well-being of youth and their friends and family.","Waselewski, Eric; Waselewski, Marika; Harper, Chloe; Dickey, Sarah; Bell, Sue Anne; Chang, Tammy",Annals of family medicine,50,27
75659,75659,75659,Gene expression profiles in murine influenza pneumonia.,11.474999,7.1201806,2009,"BACKGROUND Patient engagement with diabetes self-care is critical to reducing morbidity and mortality. Social media is one form of digital health that is available for diabetes self-care, although its use for peer-to-peer communication has not been systematically described, and its potential to support patient self-care is unclear. OBJECTIVE The primary aim of this systematic review was to describe the use of social media among patients (peer-to-peer) to manage diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The secondary aim was to assess patients' clinical outcomes, behavioral outcomes, quality of life, and self-efficacy resulting from peer-to-peer social media use. METHODS We conducted a literature search in the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycINFO (January 2008 through April 2019). The inclusion criteria were quantitative studies that included peer-to-peer use of social media for self-care of diabetes mellitus (with all subtypes) and CVD, including stroke. RESULTS After an initial yield of 3066 citations, we selected 91 articles for a full-text review and identified 7 papers that met our inclusion criteria. Of these, 4 studies focused on type 1 diabetes, 1 study included both type 1 and 2 diabetes, and 2 studies included multiple chronic conditions (eg, CVD, diabetes, depression, etc). Our search did not yield any individual studies on CVD alone. Among the selected papers, 2 studies used commercial platforms (Facebook and I Seek You), 3 studies used discussion forums developed specifically for each study, and 2 surveyed patients through different platforms or blogs. There was significant heterogeneity in the study designs, methodologies, and outcomes applied, but all studies showed favorable results on either primary or secondary outcomes. The quality of studies was highly variable. CONCLUSIONS The future landscape of social media use for patient self-care is promising. However, current use is nascent. Our extensive search yielded only 7 studies, all of which included diabetes, indicating the most interest and demand for peer-to-peer interaction on diabetes self-care. Future research is needed to establish efficacy and safety in recommending social media use among peers for diabetes self-care and other conditions.","Elnaggar, Abdelaziz; Ta Park, Van; Lee, Sei J; Bender, Melinda; Siegmund, Lee Anne; Park, Linda G",Journal of medical Internet research,50,1

While virtual reality (VR) has been utilized for resident training and neuroanatomy education, application of VR has been limited for neurosurgical education in medical school. This is the first report of a comprehensive, multicomponent teaching model with VR as a primary component to neurosurgical and neuroanatomy education for pre-clerkship medical students. DESIGN Twelve second-year medical students were included in this prospective survey study that was conducted to evaluate a year-long neurosurgery elective course with an interactive VR platform as a primary teaching tool for neuroanatomy and neurosurgical procedures. The course had 4 components: (1) didactic/lecture-based learning, (2) problem-based learning, (3) hands-on skills lab, and (4) VR-based learning through Surgical Theater's Precision VR visualization platform. Outcome measures were based on confidence levels measured on pre- and post-course competency confidence surveys in students' ability to identify neuroanatomical structures, interpret neuroradiological imaging, and analyze neurosurgical cases, and student feedback on their experience with VR on a postcourse survey. SETTING The survey study was conducted in the neurosurgery library and conference room at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio, USA. PARTICIPANTS All 12 second-year medical students who enrolled in the neurosurgery zero-credit hour course completed the course. RESULTS At course conclusion, 100% of students reported significantly higher competency confidence levels on all topics, and 100% agreed utilizing VR helped them gain a deeper understanding of neuroanatomy/neurosurgery. 92% agreed that using VR helped them better retain the anatomical/functional details of the brain/spine, and 69% better understand neurosurgical skills taught, respectively. 100% of students found the course to be a valuable learning experience and VR a useful learning tool. CONCLUSION A comprehensive multi-component neurosurgery elective course using VR as a primary teaching tool may improve neurosurgical education in medical school.","Atli, Karam; Selman, Warren; Ray, Abhishek",Journal of surgical education,50,26

Here we show that, just before its 2013 spread to the Americas, Zika virus (ZIKV) underwent an envelope protein V473M substitution (E-V473M) that increased neurovirulence, maternal-to-fetal transmission, and viremia to facilitate urban transmission. A preepidemic Asian ZIKV strain (FSS13025 isolated in Cambodia in 2010) engineered with the V473M substitution significantly increased neurovirulence in neonatal mice and produced higher viral loads in the placenta and fetal heads in pregnant mice. Conversely, an epidemic ZIKV strain (PRVABC59 isolated in Puerto Rico in 2015) engineered with the inverse M473V substitution reversed the pathogenic phenotypes. Although E-V473M did not affect oral infection of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, competition experiments in cynomolgus macaques showed that this mutation increased its fitness for viremia generation, suggesting adaptive evolution for human viremia and hence transmission. Mechanistically, the V473M mutation, located at the second transmembrane helix of the E protein, enhances virion morphogenesis. Overall, our study revealed E-V473M as a critical determinant for enhanced ZIKV virulence, intrauterine transmission during pregnancy, and viremia to facilitate urban transmission.","Shan, Chao; Xia, Hongjie; Haller, Sherry L; Azar, Sasha R; Liu, Yang; Liu, Jianying; Muruato, Antonio E; Chen, Rubing; Rossi, Shannan L; Wakamiya, Maki; Vasilakis, Nikos; Pei, Rongjuan; Fontes-Garfias, Camila R; Singh, Sanjay Kumar; Xie, Xuping; Weaver, Scott C; Shi, Pei-Yong",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,50,1

Whole-exome sequencing in five families affected by mild to severe cutis laxa, dysmorphic facial features, and cardiopulmonary involvement identified biallelic missense mutations in ATP6V1E1 and ATP6V1A, which encode the E1 and A subunits, respectively, of the V1 domain of the heteromultimeric V-ATPase complex. Structural modeling indicated that all substitutions affect critical residues and inter- or intrasubunit interactions. Furthermore, complexome profiling, a method combining blue-native gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, showed that they disturb either the assembly or the stability of the V-ATPase complex. Protein glycosylation was variably affected.

SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, belongs to the genus of betacoronaviruses which also includes SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV; causative agents for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, respectively. Studies demonstrating the neural invasion of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo are still scarce, although such characteristics of certain other betacoronaviruses are well demonstrated in the literature. Based on the recent evidence for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry receptors in specific components of the human nervous and vascular tissue, a neural (olfactory and/or vagal), and a hematogenous-crossing the blood-brain barrier, routes have been proposed. The neurological symptoms in COVID-19 may also arise as a consequence of the ""cytokine storm"" (characteristically present in severe disease) induced neuroinflammation, or co-morbidities. There is also a possibility that, there may be multiple routes of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the brain, or multiple mechanisms can be involved in the pathogenesis of the neurological symptoms. In this review article, we have discussed the possible routes of SARS-CoV-2 brain entry based on the emerging evidence for this virus, and that available for other betacoronaviruses in literature.","Kumar, Ashutosh; Pareek, Vikas; Prasoon, Pranav; Faiq, Muneeb A; Kumar, Pavan; Kumari, Chiman; Narayan, Ravi K",Journal of neuroscience research,50,7

Early work focused on rapid sequencing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), subsequent in-vitro and in-silico work, along with greater understanding of the different clinical phases of the infection, have helped identify a catalogue of potential therapeutic agents requiring assessment. In a pandemic, there is a need to quickly identify efficacious treatments, and reject those that are non-beneficial or even harmful, using randomised clinical trials. Whilst each potential treatment could be investigated across multiple, separate, competing two-arm trials, this is a very inefficient process. Despite the very large numbers of interventional trials for COVID-19, the vast majority have not used efficient trial designs. Well conducted, adaptive platform trials utilising a multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) approach provide a solution to overcome limitations of traditional designs. The multi-arm element allows multiple different treatments to be investigated simultaneously against a shared, standard-of-care control arm. The multi-stage element uses interim analyses to assess accumulating data from the trial and ensure that only treatments showing promise continue to recruitment during the next stage of the trial. The ability to test many treatments at once and drop insufficiently active interventions significantly speeds up the rate at which answers can be achieved. This article provides an overview of the benefits of MAMS designs and successes of trials, which have used this approach to COVID-19. We also discuss international collaboration between trial teams, including prospective agreement to synthesise trial results, and identify the most effective interventions. We believe that international collaboration will help provide faster answers for patients, clinicians, and health care systems around the world, including for each further wave of COVID-19, and enable preparedness for future global health pandemics.","Noor, Nurulamin M; Pett, Sarah L; Esmail, Hanif; Crook, Angela M; Vale, Claire L; Sydes, Matthew R; Parmar, Mahesh K B",F1000Research,50,1

METHODS This study was a retrospective chart review of all patients diagnosed with DKA and managed in our pediatric ED during a 1-year period. A ""flight plan"" was created for each patient's ED visit, from triage to final disposition. Each flight was analyzed with the goal of identifying threats and errors that may impact patients' clinical status or management. Particular focus was placed on physicians' adherence to hospital and provincial DKA protocols. Unintended patient states or outcomes were also noted. RESULTS A total of 46 patient flights were outlined and analyzed. A total of 146 threats were identified, affecting 43 (93%) patient flights. No flight was error-free. Errors in communication and lack of adherence to protocol were the most common types of errors. Unintended patient states occurred in 30 cases (65%), some of which were preceded by at least 1 error. There were no cases of cerebral edema or death. CONCLUSIONS It is important to identify and appropriately mitigate threats and errors that commonly occur during initial management of DKA in the ED to prevent unintended states and patient morbidity. This study demonstrates the threat-and-error model as a potentially useful tool for focusing quality improvement initiatives in the pediatric ED setting.","Tenedero, Christine Bernice; Soliman, Aiah; Samaan, M Constantine; Kam, April Jacqueline",Pediatric emergency care,50,1

However, studies on the association between methamphetamine use and adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART) are limited and had inconsistent findings. This study aimed to determine the impact of methamphetamine use on adherence to ART among MSM living with HIV. From December 2018 to October 2019, MSM living with HIV were recruited (N = 351) and non-adherence to ART was defined as a Medication Adherence Report Scale score of <23. Overall, 16.0% of the participants reported methamphetamine use in the prior three months and 13.4% of the participants had non-adherence to ART. The proportion of non-adherence to ART among HIV-positive MSM were 28.6% and 10.5% with and without methamphetamine use, respectively. After controlling for demographics, illicit drug use, and co-morbidities, methamphetamine use during the prior three months was associated with a higher risk of non-adherence to ART (adjusted odds ratio = 3.08; 95% confidence intervals: 1.24-7.69). Compared with HIV-positive MSM with non-adherence to ART, HIV-positive MSM with good adherence to ART had a higher CD4 counts and were more likely to achieve an undetectable viral load. Since poor adherence to ART is associated with an increased HIV viral load and the risk of HIV transmission to others, our study suggests that it is imperative to screen HIV-positive patients for methamphetamine use and to provide effective therapy to reduce methamphetamine use and the associated non-adherence to ART.","Lai, Hsin-Hao; Kuo, Yen-Chun; Kuo, Chian-Jue; Lai, Yun-Ju; Chen, Marcelo; Chen, Yi-Tui; Chen, Chu-Chieh; Yen, Muh-Yong; Hu, Bor-Shen; Wang, Teng-Ho; Wang, Chien Chun; Kuo, Li-Lan; Yen, Tsen-Fang; Chuang, Pei-Hung; Yen, Yung-Feng",Scientific reports,50,17

Protein machinery that fuses macrophages remains to be identified. In the present study, we explored the fusion stage of osteoclast formation for RAW macrophage-like murine cells and for macrophages derived from human monocytes. To uncouple fusion from the preceding differentiation processes, we accumulated fusion-committed cells in the presence of LPC (lysophosphatidylcholine) that reversibly blocks membrane merger. After 16 h, we removed LPC and observed cell fusion events that would normally develop within 16 h develop instead within 30-90 min. Thus, whereas osteoclastogenesis, generally, takes several days, our approach allowed us to focus on an hour in which we observe robust fusion between the cells. Complementing syncytium formation assay with a novel membrane merger assay let us study the synchronized fusion events downstream of a local merger between two plasma membranes, but before expansion of nascent membrane connections and complete unification of the cells. We found that the expansion of membrane connections detected as a growth of multinucleated osteoclasts depends on dynamin activity. In contrast, a merger between the plasma membranes of the two cells was not affected by inhibitors of dynamin GTPase. Thus dynamin that was recently found to control late stages of myoblast fusion also controls late stages of macrophage fusion, revealing an intriguing conserved mechanistic motif shared by diverse cell-cell fusion processes.","Verma, Santosh K; Leikina, Evgenia; Melikov, Kamran; Chernomordik, Leonid V",The Biochemical journal,50,1

In all limbs, postcontrast CT was performed after intra-articular contrast medium injection of the tarsocrural, centrodistal, and tarsometatarsal joints. Images were matched with corresponding anatomic slices. Four tarsi with pathological changes underwent CT examination. RESULTS The tibia, talus, calcaneus, and central, fused first and second, third, and fourth tarsal bones were clearly visualized as well as the long digital extensor, superficial digital flexor, lateral digital flexor (with tarsal flexor retinaculum), gastrocnemius, peroneus tertius, and tibialis cranialis tendons and the long plantar ligament. The lateral digital extensor, medial digital flexor, split peroneus tertius, and tibialis cranialis tendons and collateral ligaments could be located but not always clearly identified. Some small tarsal ligaments were identifiable, including plantar, medial, interosseus, and lateral talocalcaneal ligaments; interosseus talocentral, centrodistal, and tarsometatarsal ligaments; proximal and distal plantar ligaments; and talometatarsal ligament. Parts of the articular cartilage could be assessed on postcontrast images. Lesions were detected in the 4 tarsi with pathological changes. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE CT of the tarsus is recommended when radiography and ultrasonography are inconclusive and during preoperative planning for treatment of complex fractures.

Of the various pattern recognition receptors in the host, the cytosolic RNA helicases interact with viral RNA to activate the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and subsequent cellular interferon response. On the other hand, viruses explore multiple strategies to resist the host immunity. In this study, we found that NDV infection induced MAVS degradation. Further analysis showed that NDV V protein degraded MAVS through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to inhibit IFN-β production. Moreover, NDV V protein led to proteasomal degradation of MAVS through Lys362 and Lys461 ubiquitin to prevent IFN production. Further studies showed that NDV V protein recruited E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF5 to polyubiquitinate and degrade MAVS. Compared with the wild-type NDV infection, V-deficient NDV induced attenuated MAVS degradation and enhanced IFN-β production at the late stage of infection. Several other paramyxovirus V proteins showed similar activities of degrading MAVS and blocking IFN production as NDV V protein did. The present study revealed a novel role of NDV V protein on targeting MAVS to inhibit cellular IFN production, which reinforces the fact that the virus orchestrates the cellular antiviral response to its own benefit.ImportanceHost anti-RNA virus innate immunity relies mainly on the recognition by retinoic acid-inducible gene I and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5, and subsequently initiates downstream signaling through interaction with mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS). On the other hand, viruses have developed various strategies to counteract MAVS-mediated signaling. The mechanism for paramyxoviruses regulating MAVS to benefit their infection remains unknown. In this article, we demonstrate that the V proteins of NDV and several other paramyxoviruses target MAVS for ubiquitin-mediated degradation through E3 ubiquitin ligase RING-finger protein 5 (RNF5). The MAVS degradation leads to the inhibition of the downstream IFN-β pathway and therefore benefits virus proliferation. Our study reveals a novel mechanism of NDV evading host innate immunity and provides insight into the therapeutic strategies for the control of paramyxovirus infection.","Sun, Yingjie; Zheng, Hang; Yu, Shengqing; Ding, Yunlei; Wu, Wei; Mao, Xuming; Liao, Ying; Meng, Chunchun; Rehman, Zaib Ur; Tan, Lei; Song, Cuiping; Qiu, Xusheng; Wu, Fengyun; Ding, Chan",Journal of virology,50,6

METHODS We present a retrospective cohort study of 75 kidney transplants in patients who recovered from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed COVID-19 performed across 22 transplant centers in India from July 3, 2020 to January 31, 2021. We detail demographics, clinical manifestations, immunosuppression regimen, laboratory findings, treatment and outcomes. Patients with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 were accepted after documenting 2 negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests, normal chest imaging with complete resolution of symptom for at least 28 days and significant social distancing for 14 days prior to surgery. RESULTS Clinical severity in patients ranged from asymptomatic (n=17, 22.7%), mild(n=36,48%), moderate(n=15,20%) and severe(n=7,9.3%) disease. Median duration between PCR positive to transplant was 60 days (overall) and, increased significantly from asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe disease (49,57,83,94 days, P-value 0.019) respectively. All recipients and donors were asymptomatic with normal creatinine after surgery at a median (interquartile range) follow up of 81 (56-117) days without any complications relating to surgery or COVID-19. Patient and graft survival was 100%, and acute rejection was reported in 6.6%.

Early modelling studies highlighted the potential of digital contact tracing to break transmission chains, and Google and Apple subsequently developed the Exposure Notification (EN) framework, making it available to the vast majority of smartphones. A growing number of governments have launched or announced EN-based contact tracing apps, but their effectiveness remains unknown. Here, we report early findings of the digital contact tracing app deployment in Switzerland. We demonstrate proof-of-principle that digital contact tracing reaches exposed contacts, who then test positive for SARS-CoV-2. This indicates that digital contact tracing is an effective complementary tool for controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Continued technical improvement and international compatibility can further increase the efficacy, particularly also across country borders.","Salathé, Marcel; Althaus, Christian; Anderegg, Nanina; Antonioli, Daniele; Ballouz, Tala; Bugnon, Edouard; Čapkun, Srdjan; Jackson, Dennis; Kim, Sang-Il; Larus, Jim; Low, Nicola; Lueks, Wouter; Menges, Dominik; Moullet, Cédric; Payer, Mathias; Riou, Julien; Stadler, Theresa; Troncoso, Carmela; Vayena, Effy; von Wyl, Viktor",Swiss medical weekly,50,1

Methods:Dogs were randomized into groups that received CCT or SPB after surgery. Weight bearing was measured using a weight distribution platform before and the day after surgery. Stifle joint flexion and extension were measured using a goniometer before and the day after surgery. Rectal temperatures were measured every 15 min for 2 h after surgery and the morning after surgery. Mechanical nociceptive thresholds (MNT) were measured using an algometer the day after surgery. Findings in both groups were compared using a mixed model ANOVA. Results:20 dogs were enrolled: 10 in the CCT and 10 in the SPB group. Dogs undergoing CCT had more stifle joint flexion (P = 0.008) and weight bearing (P < 0.001) after surgery than dogs with SPB. MNT after surgery correlated statistically with stifle joint flexion after surgery (r = -0.315, P = 0.014), extension after surgery (r = 0.310, P = 0.016), and weight bearing after surgery (r = 0.314, P = 0.003). Return to normothermia was delayed in the CCT group, with temperatures ~0.5°C (1.0°F) lower 105 (P = 0.018) and 120 min (P = 0.013) after surgery. Conclusion:Relative to bandaging, CCT had a positive short-term impact on stifle flexion and weight bearing. CCT delayed warming after surgery but dogs were only mildly hypothermic [0.5°C [1.0°F]].","Szabo, Stephanie D; Levine, David; Marcellin-Little, Denis J; Sidaway, Brian K; Hofmeister, Erik; Urtuzuastegui, Erica",Frontiers in veterinary science,50,6

Although survival is prolonged with new therapies and better management, the magnitude of the burden resulting from moderate-to-severe disease is increasing. One of the major aims of the disease management is to try to break the vicious cycle of patients being homebound and to promote an active lifestyle. A fundamental component of active daily life is, of course, travelling. Today, the world is getting smaller with the option of travelling by air. Air travel is usually the most preferred choice as it is easy, time saving, and relatively inexpensive. Although it is a safe choice for many passengers, the environment inside the aeroplane may sometimes have adverse effects on health. Hypobaric hypoxaemia due to cabin altitude may cause health risks in COPD patients who have limited cardiopulmonary reserve. Addressing the potential risks of air travel, promoting proactive strategies including pre-flight assessment, and education of COPD patients about the ""fitness to fly"" concept are essential. Thus, in this narrative review, we evaluated the current evidence for potential risks of air travel in COPD and tried to give a perspective for how to plan safe air travel for COPD patients.","Ergan, Begum; Akgun, Metin; Pacilli, Angela Maria Grazia; Nava, Stefano",European respiratory review : an official journal of the European Respiratory Society,50,7

Despite major efforts, there are no vaccines available for these viruses. The conserved region VI (CR VI) of the large (L) polymerase proteins of paramyxoviruses catalyzes methyltransferase (MTase) activities that typically methylate viral mRNAs at positions guanine N-7 (G-N-7) and ribose 2'-O. In this study, we generated a panel of recombinant hMPVs carrying mutations in the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding site in CR VI of L protein. These recombinant viruses were specifically defective in ribose 2'-O methylation but not G-N-7 methylation and were genetically stable and highly attenuated in cell culture and viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of cotton rats. Importantly, vaccination of cotton rats with these recombinant hMPVs (rhMPVs) with defective MTases triggered a high level of neutralizing antibody, and the rats were completely protected from challenge with wild-type rhMPV. Collectively, our results indicate that (i) amino acid residues in the SAM binding site in the hMPV L protein are essential for 2'-O methylation and (ii) inhibition of mRNA cap MTase can serve as a novel target to rationally design live attenuated vaccines for hMPV and perhaps other paramyxoviruses, such as hRSV and hPIV3. IMPORTANCE Human paramyxoviruses, including hRSV, hMPV, and hPIV3, cause the majority of acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections in humans, particularly in infants, children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Currently, there is no licensed vaccine available. A formalin-inactivated vaccine is not suitable for these viruses because it causes enhanced lung damage upon reinfection with the same virus. A live attenuated vaccine is the most promising vaccine strategy for human paramyxoviruses. However, it remains a challenge to identify an attenuated virus strain that has an optimal balance between attenuation and immunogenicity. Using reverse genetics, we generated a panel of recombinant hMPVs that were specifically defective in ribose 2'-O methyltransferase (MTase) but not G-N-7 MTase. These MTase-defective hMPVs were genetically stable and sufficiently attenuated but retained high immunogenicity. This work highlights a critical role of 2'-O MTase in paramyxovirus replication and pathogenesis and a new avenue for the development of safe and efficacious live attenuated vaccines for hMPV and other human paramyxoviruses.","Zhang, Yu; Wei, Yongwei; Zhang, Xiaodong; Cai, Hui; Niewiesk, Stefan; Li, Jianrong",Journal of virology,50,8

However, few studies have evaluated factors that lead to increased detection of deposition or the individual differences among patients. OBJECTIVE To measure the effect of repeated dosages of gadopentetate dimeglumine on pediatric brains and to determine the factors that influence signal intensity changes. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective study evaluated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients <18 years of age who received >5 doses of gadopentetate dimeglumine. Regions of interest were placed in 30 locations in the brain on axial precontrast T1 images. Signal intensity ratios were evaluated throughout the brain. The effect of increasing gadopentetate dimeglumine exposure on signal intensity ratios was assessed using linear mixed models adjusted for gender, age, imaging sequence type (fast spin echo or gradient echo), MRI manufacturer (General Electric, Philips or Siemens), and field strength (1.5 tesla [T] or 3 T). Finally, the variance of the random slope in the linear mixed models was tested to determine if there were differences in the rate of signal intensity ratio change among individuals. RESULTS Fifty patients (M:F=25:25; mean age at first imaging: 6.4 years) with a mean of 21.5 gadopentetate dimeglumine administrations (range: 6-86) were included. There were significant increases in T1 signal in the globus pallidus, dentate nucleus and pulvinar with an increasing number of contrast administrations. Patient gender, age, and MRI field strength were not associated with changing signal intensity ratios. However, MRI sequence type and vendor significantly impacted some measured signal intensity ratios. Finally, significant differences in the slopes of the ratios were present among patients for multiple locations. CONCLUSION Repeated administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine is associated with T1 hyperintense signal in the dentate nucleus, globus pallidus and pulvinar. Detection is significantly affected by MRI sequence type and scanner vendor. Even when accounting for these differences, there are individual differences in the slope of signal intensity change suggesting a patient-level effect influences gadolinium deposition.","Towbin, Alexander J; Zhang, Bin; Dillman, Jonathan R",Pediatric radiology,50,1

The purpose of this study was to investigate if iMil administered before CPB would be superior to placebo in facilitating separation from CPB. METHODS High-risk cardiac surgical patients with PH were randomized to receive iMil or placebo after the induction of anesthesia and before CPB. Hemodynamic parameters and RV function were evaluated by means of pulmonary artery catheterization and transesophageal echocardiography. The groups were compared for the primary outcome of the level of difficulty in weaning from CPB. Among the secondary outcomes examined were the reduction in the severity of PH, the incidence of RV failure, and mortality. RESULTS Of the 124 patients randomized, the mean (standard deviation [SD]) EuroSCORE II was 8.0 (2.6), and the baseline mean (SD) systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) was 53 (9) mmHg. The use of iMil was associated with increases in cardiac output (P = 0.03) and a reduction in SPAP (P = 0.04) with no systemic hypotension. Nevertheless, there was no difference in the combined incidence of difficult or complex separation from CPB between the iMil and control groups (30% vs 28%, respectively; absolute difference, 2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -14 to 18; P = 0.78). There was also no difference in RV failure between the iMil and control groups (15% vs 14%, respectively; difference, 1%; 95% CI, -13 to 12; P = 0.94). Mortality was increased in patients with RV failure vs those without (22% vs 2%, respectively; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION In high-risk cardiac surgery patients with PH, the prophylactic use of iMil was associated with favourable hemodynamic effects that did not translate into improvement of clinically relevant endpoints.

These pathways rely on protein ubiquitination for their activation, and one outcome is the modification of proteins with the ubiquitin (Ub)-like modifier interferon-stimulated gene (ISG)15. CCHFV and related viruses encode a deubiquitinase (DUB) of the ovarian tumor (OTU) family, which unlike eukaryotic OTU DUBs also targets ISG15 modifications. Here we characterized the viral OTU domain of CCHFV (vOTU) biochemically and structurally, revealing that it hydrolyzes four out of six tested Ub linkages, but lacks activity against linear and K29-linked Ub chains. vOTU cleaved Ub and ISG15 with similar kinetics, and we were able to understand vOTU cross-reactivity at the molecular level from crystal structures of vOTU in complex with Ub and ISG15. An N-terminal extension in vOTU not present in eukaryotic OTU binds to the hydrophobic Ile44 patch of Ub, which results in a dramatically different Ub orientation compared to a eukaryotic OTU-Ub complex. The C-terminal Ub-like fold of ISG15 (ISG15-C) adopts an equivalent binding orientation. Interestingly, ISG15-C contains an additional second hydrophobic surface that is specifically contacted by vOTU. These subtle differences in Ub/ISG15 binding allowed the design of vOTU variants specific for either Ub or ISG15, which will be useful tools to understand the relative contribution of ubiquitination vs. ISGylation in viral infection. Furthermore, the crystal structures will allow structure-based design of antiviral agents targeting this enzyme.","Akutsu, Masato; Ye, Yu; Virdee, Satpal; Chin, Jason W; Komander, David",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,50,17

METHODS We studied 510 IBD patients [338 Crohn's disease, 157 ulcerative colitis, 15 indeterminate colitis] with initiation of AZA treatment in a prospective multicentre registry study. Acute pancreatitis was diagnosed in accordance with international guidelines. RESULTS AZA was continued by 324 [63.5%] and stopped by 186 [36.5%] patients. The most common cause of discontinuation was nausea [12.2%]. AZA-induced pancreatitis occurred in 37 patients [7.3%]. Of these: 43% were hospitalised with a median inpatient time period of 5 days; 10% had peripancreatic fluid collections; 24% had vomiting; and 14% had fever. No patient had to undergo nonsurgical or surgical interventions. Smoking was the strongest risk factor for AZA-induced acute pancreatitis [p < 0.0002] in univariate and multivariate analyses.

Thus, if the anti-fibrosis modality is efficiently applied, the regeneration capacity of the liver should be reactivated even in such refractory hepatic diseases. METHODS Rat liver fibrosis was induced by dimethyl-nitrosamine (DMN). Another liver fibrosis model was established in CCl4 treated Sox9CreERT2ROSA26: YFP mice. To resolve hepatic fibrosis, vitamin A coupled liposomes containing siRNA HSP47 (VA-liposome siHSP47) were employed. EpCAM+hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) from GFP rats were transplanted to DMN rat liver to examine their trans-differentiation into hepatic cells after resolution of liver fibrosis. RESULTS Even under continuous exposure to such strong hepato-toxin as DMN, rats undergoing VA-liposome siHSP47 treatment showed an increment of DNA synthesis of hepatocytes with the concomitant restoration of impaired liver weight and normalization of albumin levels. These results were consistent with the observation that GFP+EpCAM HPCs transplanted to DMN rat liver, trans-differentiated into GFP+ mature hepatic cells after VA-liposome siHSP47 treatment. Another rodent model also proved regeneration potential of the fibrotic liver in CCl4 administered Sox9CreERT2ROSA26: YFP mice, VA-liposome siHSP47 treatment-induced restoration of liver weight and trans-differentiation of YEP+Sox9+cells into YFP+ hepatic cells, though because of relatively mild hepatotoxicity of CCl4, undamaged hepatocytes also proliferated. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrated that regeneration of chronically damaged liver indeed occurs after anti-fibrosis treatment even under continuous exposure to hepatotoxin, which promises a significant benefit of the anti-fibrosis therapy for refractory liver diseases.","Sato, Yasushi; Yoneda, Akihiro; Shimizu, Fumiko; Nishimura, Miyuki; Shimoyama, Rai; Tashiro, Yasuyuki; Kurata, Wataru; Niitsu, Yoshiro",Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,50,1

Comparing treatments for these genitourinary symptoms are restricted by the use of different outcome measures in clinical trials and the omission of outcomes, which may be relevant to women. The aim of this project was to develop a Core Outcome Set (COS) to be reported in clinical trials of treatments for genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause. METHODS We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials of treatments for genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause and extracted their outcomes. This list was refined and entered into a two-round modified Delphi survey, which was open to clinicians, researchers, and postmenopausal women from November 2019 to March 2020. Outcomes were scored on a nine-point scale from ""not important"" to ""critically important."" The final COS was determined following two international consensus meetings. RESULTS A total of 26 unique outcomes were included in the Delphi process, which was completed by 227 participants of whom 58% were postmenopausal women, 34% clinicians, and 8% researchers. Predefined thresholds were applied to the Delphi scores to categorize outcomes by importance, which informed the e consensus meetings, attended by 43 participants from 21 countries. The final COS includes eight outcomes: (1) pain with sex, (2) vulvovaginal dryness, (3) vulvovaginal discomfort or irritation, (4) discomfort or pain when urinating, (5) change in most bothersome symptom, (6) distress, bother or interference of genitourinary symptoms, (7) satisfaction with treatment, (8) side effects of treatment. CONCLUSION These eight core outcomes reflect the joint priorities of postmenopausal women, clinicians, and researchers internationally. Standardized collection and reporting of these outcomes in clinical trials will facilitate the comparison of different treatments for genitourinary symptoms, advance clinical practice, and ultimately improve outcomes for symptomatic women.

The differences in the elution time of different compounds allowed us to rank the binding affinity of each compound. Consistent with previous results, FAC-MS showed that SAM binds to MetJ with the highest affinity. In addition, adenine and 5'-deoxy-5'-(methylthio)adenosine bind to the effector binding site on MetJ. Our experiments with MetJ demonstrate that FAC-MS is capable of screening complex mixtures of molecules and identifying high-affinity binders to TRs.

A safety consideration for the application of chloroquine is its QTc-prolonging potential. Thus far, no data are available on the QTc-prolonging potential of chloroquine in COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE To assess the degree of chloroquine-induced QTc prolongation in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. METHODS A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) and ECGs recorded during chloroquine treatment were retrospectively collected in patients suspected of having COVID-19. The QTc interval was calculated by computerised and manual interpretation. Baseline and follow-up QTc intervals were compared using the paired samples t-test. RESULTS A total of 95 patients had a baseline ECG recording and at least one ECG recording during chloroquine therapy. Chloroquine treatment resulted in a mean QTc prolongation of 35 ms (95% CI 28-43 ms) using computerised interpretation and 34 ms (95% CI 25-43 ms) using manual interpretation. No torsade de pointes was observed during chloroquine treatment. After manual review, 22 patients (23%) had a QTc interval exceeding 500 ms during chloroquine treatment. None of these patients had a prolonged QTc interval prior to the initiation of chloroquine treatment. CONCLUSIONS Chloroquine significantly prolongs the QTc interval in a clinically relevant matter. This highlights the need for ECG monitoring when prescribing chloroquine to COVID-19 patients.","van den Broek, M P H; Möhlmann, J E; Abeln, B G S; Liebregts, M; van Dijk, V F; van de Garde, E M W",Netherlands heart journal : monthly journal of the Netherlands Society of Cardiology and the Netherlands Heart Foundation,50,1

METHOD A retrospective review was undertaken of complex abdominal wall repairs performed by a single surgical team, assessing the outcome of the retro-rectus repair and factors affecting the outcome. RESULTS Between 2007 and 2013, 57 (33 male) patients underwent CAWR retro-rectus repair. The material used was assessed as either synthetic or biologic (cross-linked porcine dermal collagen). The Ventral Hernia Working Group grades were similar between groups of patients having a repair with synthetic and biologic mesh. Median follow-up in the synthetic group was 18 months (1-80.5) and 18.4 months (0.5-70.7) in the biologic group. There was no statistical difference in seroma, wound infection or haematoma rates. No fistulae occurred in either group. Overall recurrence was 3.4% and there was no statistical difference between groups. CONCLUSION The retro-rectus repair technique is associated with a low rate of recurrence and is now the technique of choice. The choice of material, biologic or synthetic, in Ventral Hernia Working Group grades 1-3 remains controversial.","Warwick, Andrea M; Smart, Neil J; Daniels, Ian R",ANZ journal of surgery,50,24

The traditional two-stage open surgical approach to extensive arch and descending thoracic aneurysms carries a significant interval mortality rate. We report the results of a single-stage technique of total arch and descending thoracic aortic replacement by a left thoracotomy. METHODS From January 1995 to February 2011, 426 patients underwent thoracic or thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair, of which a highly selected group of 27 patients underwent total arch replacement with descending thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic replacement. All procedures were performed with hypothermic circulatory arrest and selective antegrade cerebral perfusion. Two patients required transverse division of the sternum. Two patients had emergency or urgent operations. Five patients had concomitant coronary artery bypass, and 1 had concomitant mitral valve replacement. RESULTS There were no hospital deaths, no cerebrovascular accidents, and one instance of transient spinal cord ischemia. Three patients had acute renal failure not requiring hemodialysis. Intubation in 5 patients exceeded 48 hours, and 1 patient needed tracheostomy. Two patients required reexploration for postoperative bleeding. Survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 95%, 78%, and 73%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Replacement of the total arch and descending thoracic aorta by a left thoracotomy provides excellent short-term and long-term results for the treatment of extensive arch and thoracic aortic pathology, without the need for a second-stage operation. Other cardiac pathologies, such as left-sided coronary disease and mitral valve disease, can be addressed concurrently.","Corvera, Joel S; Fehrenbacher, John W",The Annals of thoracic surgery,50,1

STUDY DESIGN We offered the study at 10 sites that provided the service in 13 states and Washington DC. Interested individuals obtained any needed pre-abortion tests locally and had a videoconference with a study clinician. Sites sent study packages containing mifepristone and misoprostol by mail and had remote follow-up consultations within one month by telephone (or by online survey, if the participant could not be reached) to evaluate abortion completeness. The analysis was descriptive. RESULTS We mailed 1390 packages between May 2016 and September 2020. Of the 83% (1157/1390) of abortions for which we obtained outcome information, 95% (1103/1157) were completed without a procedure. Participants made 70 unplanned visits to emergency rooms or urgent care centers for reasons related to the abortion (6%), and ten serious adverse events occurred, including five transfusions (0.4%). Enrollment increased substantially with the onset of COVID-19. Although a screening ultrasound was required, sites determined in 52% (346/669) of abortions that occurred during COVID that those participants should not get the test to protect their health. Use of urine pregnancy test to confirm abortion completion increased from 67% (144/214) in the six months prior to COVID to 90% (602/669) in the six months during COVID. Nearly all satisfaction questionnaires (99%, 1013/1022) recorded that participants were satisfied with the service. CONCLUSIONS This direct-to-patient telemedicine service was safe, effective, and acceptable, and supports the claim that there is no medical reason for mifepristone to be dispensed in clinics as required by the Food and Drug Administration. In some cases, participants did not need to visit any facilities to obtain the service, which was critical to protecting patient safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chong, Erica; Shochet, Tara; Raymond, Elizabeth; Platais, Ingrida; Anger, Holly A; Raidoo, Shandhini; Soon, Reni; Grant, Melissa S; Haskell, Susan; Tocce, Kristina; Baldwin, Maureen K; Boraas, Christy M; Bednarek, Paula H; Banks, Joey; Coplon, Leah; Thompson, Francine; Priegue, Esther; Winikoff, Beverly",Contraception,50,1

The current treatment options of IBD are not curative and are lacking in aspects like prevention of fibrosis. New treatment options are needed to fulfil the unmet needs and provide alternatives to drugs with resistances and side effects. Drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), besides being anti-hypertensive, also possess anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties, and could offer an inexpensive alternative to control inflammation and fibrosis in the gut. RAS inhibitors have been effective in preventing and alleviating colitis in preclinical studies, but available human data are still sparse. This review outlines the pathophysiological functions of RAS in the gut and summarises preclinical studies utilizing pharmacological RAS inhibitors in the treatment of experimental colitis. We discuss the alterations in intestinal RAS and the available evidence of the benefits of RAS inhibitors for IBD patients. Retrospective studies comparing IBD patients using ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers have provided optimistic results regarding a milder disease course, and fewer hospitalizations and corticosteroid use in patients using RAS inhibitors. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these promising medications in the treatment of IBD.","Salmenkari, Hanne; Korpela, Riitta; Vapaatalo, Heikki",Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology,50,1

Our study aimed to evaluate trainee and attending perceptions of online webinars as an educational tool in neurosurgery. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional survey study. A web-based 19-questions survey was distributed to the people who attended the webinar series that was carried out by the Saudi Association of Neurological Surgery (SANS) from March 29, 2020, to May 31, 2020. Candidates were identified through their registration emails. The survey was distributed between June 5 - 8, 2020. RESULTS A total of 156 responses were received (survey response rate: 60%). The overall satisfaction rate among residents and attendings (board-certified neurosurgeons) was similar (>80%). However, only 56.4% of attendings reported they were comfortable with online webinars compared to 81.2% of residents (P-value<0.0001). Seventy-five percent of residents found online lectures more useful than traditional in-person lectures compared to 52% of attendings (P-value=0.01). CONCLUSIONS Online educational webinars provide an educational value that can be considered as an adjunct to the traditional (in-person) education methods.

Here we tested a symbol-trained chimpanzee's recall memory of a hidden food item's identity after a 10-min delay. During this delay, the subject was sometimes (depending on the condition) shown consistent or inconsistent video information about the identity of the food, before being asked to name the item to a second experimenter blind to the reward and condition. Across all conditions, our subject, Sherman, correctly named the food item at above chance levels. In the Inconsistent condition, in which Sherman was shown a video with misleading information, his performance was the worst of all conditions (although accuracy was still high). Interestingly, however, during three of the four trials in this condition in which Sherman made a mistake, he incorrectly named the food item shown during the misleading video information. These results provide evidence that chimpanzees, like humans, may be vulnerable to misinformation effects, even when that misleading information is presented in a different modality (video) than the original live event memory, demonstrating further commonality between human and ape memory systems.","James, Brielle T; Webster, Mackenzie F; Menzel, Charles R; Whitham, Will; Beran, Michael J",Animal cognition,50,1

Study of PML-type JCPyV in vitro has been limited due to difficulty in efficient propagation of the virus in cultured cells. In this study, we carried out long term cultivation of COS-7 cells (designated as COS-IMRb cells) transfected with PML type M1-IMRb, an adapted viral DNA with a rearranged non-coding control region (NCCR). The JCPyV derived from COS-IMRb cells was characterized by analyzing viral replication, amount of virus by hemagglutination (HA), production of viral protein 1 (VP1), and structure of the NCCR. HA assays indicated that a high amount of PML type JCPyV was present in COS-IMRb cells. Immunostaining showed that VP1-positive cells were a small population in COS-IMRb cells that represented a JCPyV carrier cell culture. Sequencing analysis of the NCCR of JCPyV after long-term cultivation showed that the NCCR of M1-IMRb was conserved in COS-IMRb cells without any point mutation. The JCPyV genomic DNA derived from a clone of COS-IMRb-3 cells was detected by Southern blotting as a single band of approximately 5.1 kbp without deletion. These findings support that COS-IMRb-3 cells may offer a useful tool for screening anti-JCPyV drugs.","Nukuzuma, Souichi; Nukuzuma, Chiyoko; Kameoka, Masanori; Sugiura, Shigeki; Nakamichi, Kazuo; Tasaki, Takafumi; Hidaka, Koushi; Takegami, Tsutomu",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,50,1

SUMMARY ANSWER Focal adenomyosis located in the outer myometrium (FAOM) was observed more frequently in women with endometriosis, and was significantly associated with the DIE phenotype. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY An association between endometriosis and adenomyosis has been reported previously, although data regarding the association between MRI appearance of adenomyosis and the endometriosis phenotype are currently still lacking. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This was an observational, cross-sectional study using data prospectively collected from non-pregnant patients who were between 18 and 42 years of age, and who underwent surgery for symptomatic benign gynecological conditions between January 2011 and December 2014. For each patient, a standardized questionnaire was completed during a face-to-face interview conducted by the surgeon during the month preceding the surgery. Only women with preoperative standardized uterine MRIs were retained for this study. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Surgery was performed on 292 patients with signed consent and available preoperative MRIs. After a thorough surgical examination of the abdomino-pelvic cavity, 237 women with histologically proven endometriosis were allocated to the endometriosis group and 55 symptomatic women without evidence of endometriosis to the endometriosis free group. The existence of diffuse or FAOM was studied in both groups and according to surgical endometriosis phenotypes (SUP, OMA and DIE). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Adenomyosis was observed in 59.9% (n = 175) of the total sample population (n = 292). Based on MRI, the distribution of adenomyosis was as follows: isolated diffuse adenomyosis (53 patients; 18.2%), isolated FAOM (74 patients; 25.3%), associated diffuse and FAOM (48 patients; 16.4%). Diffuse adenomyosis (isolated and associated to FAOM) was observed in one-third of the patients regardless of whether they were endometriotic patients or endometriosis free women taken as controls (34.2% (81 cases) versus 36.4% (20 cases)); P = 0.764. Among endometriotic women, diffuse adenomyosis (isolated and associated to FAOM) failed to reach significant correlation with the endometriosis phenotypes (SUP, 20.0% (8 cases); OMA, 45.2% (14 cases) and DIE, 35.5% (59 cases); P = 0.068). In striking contrast, there was a significant increase in the frequency of FAOM in endometriosis-affected women than in controls (119 cases (50.2%) versus 5.4% (3 cases); P < 0.001). FAOM correlated with the endometriosis phenotypes, significantly with DIE (SUP, 7.5% (3 cases); OMA, 19.3% (6 cases) and DIE, 66.3% (110 cases); P < 0.001). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION There was a possible selection bias due to the specificity of the study design, as it only included surgical patients in a referral center that specializes in endometriosis surgery. Therefore, women referred to our center may have suffered from particularly severe forms of endometriosis. This could explain the high number of women with DIE (166/237-70%) in our study group. This referral bias for women with severe lesions may have amplified the difference in association of FAOM with the endometriosis-affected patients compared to women without endometriosis. Furthermore, according to inclusion criteria, women in the endometriosis free group were symptomatic women. This may introduce some bias as symptomatic women may be more prone to have associated adenomyosis that in turn could have been overrepresented in the endometriosis free group. Whether this selection could have introduced a bias in the relationship between endometriosis and adenomyosis remains unknown. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS This study opens the door to future epidemiological, clinical and mechanistic studies aimed at better characterizing diffuse and focal adenomyosis. Further studies are necessary to adequately determine if diffuse and focal adenomyosis are two separate entities that differ in terms of pathogenesis.

This document offers guidance for practical evaluation/management of pediatric patients (age < 19 years) with syncope encountered in the acute or primary care setting. The writing committee used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Most syncope is vasovagal, which is benign and does not require extensive investigation. This Position Statement presents recommendations to encourage an efficient and cost-effective disposition for the many patients with a benign cause of syncope, and highlights atypical or concerning clinical findings associated with other causes of transient loss of consciousness. The prodrome and the circumstances around which the event occurred are the most important aspects of the history. Syncope occurring midexertion suggests a cardiac etiology. A family history, which includes sudden death in the young or from unknown causes or causes that might be suspected to be other than natural can be a red flag. The electrocardiogram is the most frequently ordered test, but the yield is low and the test is not cost-effective when applied broadly to a population of patients with syncope. We recommend an electrocardiogram when the history is not suggestive of vasovagal syncope and there are features suggestive of a cardiac cause like absence of a prodrome, midexertional event, family history of early-life sudden death or heart disease, abnormal physical examination, or new medication with potential cardiotoxicity. For most patients with syncope, medical testing is not required and lifestyle modifications without medications suffice to prevent recurrences.","Sanatani, Shubhayan; Chau, Vann; Fournier, Anne; Dixon, Andrew; Blondin, Renée; Sheldon, Robert S",The Canadian journal of cardiology,50,20

Yet, no evidence was offered supporting that claim. Therefore, we evaluated whether PETCO2/PaCO2 might be relevant in assessing ARDS not associated with COVID-19. METHODS We evaluated the correspondence between PETCO2/PaCO2 and VD/VT measured in 561 subjects with ARDS from a previous study in whom PETCO2 data were also available. Subjects also were analyzed according to four categories representing increasing severity of PETCO2/PaCO2 (≥0.80, 0.61 to 0.79, 0.50-0.59 and < 0.50). Correlation was assessed by either Pearson Spearman tests, group comparisons were assessed using either ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests, and dichotomous variables assessed by Fisher Exact test. Overall mortality risk was assessed by multivariate logistic regression. Alpha was set at 0.05. RESULTS PETCO2/PaCO2 correlated strongly with VD/VT (R = -0.87 [-0.89, -0.85] P < 0.001). Decreasing PETCO2/PaCO2 was associated with increased VD/VT and hospital mortality between all groups. In the univariate analysis for every 0.01 decrease in PETCO2/PaCO2 mortality risk increased by ∼1% (OR: 0.009 [0.003-0.029] P < 0.001), and maintained a strong independent association with mortality risk when adjusted for other variables: 0.19 (0.04-0.91) P = 0.039. PETCO2/PaCO2 < 0.50 was characterized both by very high VD/VT (0.82 ± 0.05, P < 0.001) and hospital mortality (70%). CONCLUSION PETCO2/PaCO2 as a surrogate for VD/VT may be a useful and practical measurement for both management and ongoing research into the nature of ARDS.","Kallet, Richard H; Lipnick, Michael S",Respiratory care,50,1

Several treatments for infected individuals have been suggested including IFN, ribavirin and passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma. Administration of IFN-α2b and ribavirin has improved outcomes of MERS-CoV infection in rhesus macaques when administered within 8 h post-challenge. However, detailed and systematic evidence on the activity of other clinically available drugs is limited. Here we compared the susceptibility of MERS-CoV with different IFN products (IFN-α2b, IFN-γ, IFN-universal, IFN-α2a and IFN-β), as well as with two antivirals, ribavirin and mycophenolic acid (MPA), against MERS-CoV (Hu/Jordan-N3/2012) in vitro. Of all the IFNs tested, IFN-β showed the strongst inhibition of MERS-CoV in vitro, with an IC₅₀ of 1.37 U ml(-1), 41 times lower than the previously reported IC₅₀ (56.08 U ml(-1)) of IFN-α2b. IFN-β inhibition was confirmed in the virus yield reduction assay, with an IC90 of 38.8 U ml(-1). Ribavirin did not inhibit viral replication in vitro at a dose that would be applicable to current treatment protocols in humans. In contrast, MPA showed strong inhibition, with an IC₅₀ of 2.87 µM. This drug has not been previously tested against MERS-CoV and may provide an alternative to ribavirin for treatment of MERS-CoV.

Epidemiologic evidence suggests that patients with comorbidities and novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection may have poor survival outcomes. However, the risk of these coexisting medical conditions in severe and non-severe cases has not been systematically reported. PURPOSE The present study aimed to estimate the association of chronic comorbidities in severe and non-severe cases. METHODS A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang Database, Chinese Scientific Journals Full-text Database (CQVIP) from the inception dates to April 1, 2020, to identify cohort studies assessing comorbidity and risk of adverse outcome. Either a fixed- or random-effects model was used to calculate the overall combined risk estimates. RESULTS A total of 22 studies involving 3286 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in the analysis. Overall, compared with the patients with non-severe cases, the pooled odds ratios (ORs) of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and respiratory diseases in patients with severe cases were 2.79 (95% confidence intervals [95% CI]: 1.66-4.69), 1.64 (95% CI: 2.30-1.08), 1.79 (95% CI: 1.08-2.96), 3.92 (95% CI: 2.45-6.28), and 1.98 (95% CI: 1.26-3.12), respectively. CONCLUSIONS This meta-analysis supports the finding that chronic comorbidities may contribute to severe outcome in patients with COVID-19. According to the findings of the present study, old age and 2 or more comorbidities are significantly impactful to COVID-19 outcomes in hospitalized patients in China.","Cheng, Sixiang; Zhao, Yuxin; Wang, Fenxiao; Chen, Yan; Kaminga, Atipatsa Chiwanda; Xu, Huilan",Medicine,50,6

Though predominantly a lower respiratory illness, other organ injuries are well-recognized. Among these, liver injury is of major interest. OBJECTIVE To define prevalence, pattern, predictors, and impact of liver injury among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were collected retrospectively among patients admitted to St. Luke's University Hospital with COVID-19 between 1 March and 18 April 2020. Association of liver tests (LTs) with mortality and need for mechanical ventilation, adjusted for demographic, clinical and biochemical predictors, was examined. RESULTS Data were available on 551 patients. Prevalence of any or ≥3 × upper limit of normal transaminase elevation on was 61.2 and 9.4% on admission, and 72.1 and 22.4% at peak. Bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase elevations were less common on admission (11.4 and 12.6%, respectively), and at peak (17.7 and 22%, respectively). All liver test (LT) elevations were consistently predicted by inflammatory markers. Hyperbilirubinemia predicted mortality on admission and at peak. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) had opposite impact on mortality with AST positively, and ALT negatively associated with mortality. Hence, besides hyperbilirubinemia, AST:ALT ratio emerged as the best marker for mortality among the LTs. CONCLUSION LT elevations among patients presenting with COVID-19 are very common, though majority are mild. Admission and peak bilirubin ≥1 mg/dl, as well as admission and peak AST:ALT ratio were significant predictors of mortality, along with age, myocardial injury, and chronic medical illness.","Goel, Harsh; Harmouch, Farah; Garg, Kawish; Saraiya, Pooja; Daly, Timothy; Kumar, Ashish; Hippen, John T",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,50,17
102101,102101,102101,Replication of the rotavirus genome requires an active ubiquitin-proteasome system.,11.487771,6.97446,2011,": Current data suggest that the opioid epidemic represents a worsening problem in the United States. However, prescribing rates of opioids have been steadily declining, suggesting that alternative opioids are becoming a major contributor to this crisis. One medication that has shown an increase in nonmedical use is loperamide. Loperamide is a peripheral mu-opioid agonist that is intended to be used for diarrhea. However, when taken at high doses and/or in combination with P-glycoprotein inhibitors, it acts centrally by penetrating the blood-brain-barrier. Loperamide crossing the blood-brain-barrier results in similar central nervous system depression as other opioids. Loperamide's over-the-counter availability and growing media presence has resulted in more cases of loperamide substance use disorder, predominantly to minimize opioid withdrawal symptoms and to produce a euphoric state. This case series presents 3 patients with loperamide-associated opioid use disorder who have been successfully treated with on-going buprenorphine treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first case-series to explore long-term buprenorphine treatment for loperamide use disorder. Our findings suggest that buprenorphine can be used for loperamide use disorder, most effectively when patients are in mild to moderate withdrawal. These cases also demonstrate how different waiting times were necessary before starting buprenorphine treatment in order to avoid precipitated withdrawal.","Brar, Jessica K; Broyan, Viktoriya R; Allgaier, Jeffrey T; Nye, Larry; Saxon, Andrew J",Journal of addiction medicine,50,1

To project the range of excess deaths potentially associated with COVID-19-related unemployment in the United States and quantify inequities in these estimates by age, race/ethnicity, gender, and education.Methods. We used previously published meta-analyzed hazard ratios (HRs) for the unemployment-mortality association, unemployment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics to estimate 1-year age-standardized deaths attributable to COVID-19-related unemployment for US workers aged 25 to 64 years. To accommodate uncertainty, we tested ranges of unemployment and HR scenarios.Results. Our best estimate is that there will be 30 231 excess deaths attributable to COVID-19-related unemployment between April 2020 and March 2021. Across scenarios, attributable deaths ranged from 8315 to 201 968. Attributable deaths were disproportionately high among Blacks, men, and those with low education.Conclusions. Deaths attributable to COVID-19-related unemployment will add to those directly associated with the virus and will disproportionately burden groups already experiencing incommensurate COVID-19 mortality.Public Health Implications.

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to design and test a novel spine neurological examination adapted for telemedicine. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Telemedicine is a rapidly evolving technology associated with numerous potential benefits for health care, especially in the modern era of value-based care. To date, no studies have assessed whether. METHODS Twenty-one healthy controls and 20 patients with cervical or lumbar spinal disease (D) were prospectively enrolled. Each patient underwent a telemedicine neurological examination as well as a traditional in-person neurological examination administered by a fellowship trained spine surgeon and a physiatrist. Both the telemedicine and in-person tests consisted of motor, sensory, and special test components. Scores were compared via univariate analysis and secondary qualitative outcomes, including responses from a satisfaction survey, were obtained upon completion of the trial. RESULTS Of the 20 patients in the D group, 9 patients had cervical disease and 11 patients had lumbar disease. Comparing healthy control with the D group, there were no significant differences with respect to all motor scores, most sensory scores, and all special tests. There was a high rate of satisfaction among the cohort with 92.7% of participants feeling ""very satisfied"" with the overall experience. CONCLUSIONS This study presents the development of a viable neurological spine examination adapted for telemedicine. The findings in this study suggest that patients have comparable motor, sensory, and special test scores with telemedicine as with a traditional in-person examination administered by an experienced clinician, as well as reporting a high rate of satisfaction among participants. To our knowledge, this is the first telemedicine neurological examination for spine surgery. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings.","Goyal, Dhruv K C; Divi, Srikanth N; Schroeder, Gregory D; Pfeifer, Ryan; Canseco, Jose A; Bowles, Daniel R; Nicholson, Kristen J; Patel, Parthik D; Reyes, Ariana A; Radcliff, Kristen E; Kurd, Mark F; Woods, Barrett I; Kaye, Ian David; Rihn, Jeffrey A; Anderson, David Greg; Hilibrand, Alan S; Kepler, Christopher K; Harrop, James S; Vaccaro, Alexander R",Clinical spine surgery,50,33

It has been available in Italy since 2017 and an increasing number of patients are treated with this drug. OBJECTIVES To evaluate DMF effectiveness, side effects and drug survival in a dermatological real-life setting. METHODS We performed a retrospective multi-center study in 5 dermatologic clinics in Emilia-Romagna, Northern Italy, which included all consecutive patients affected by moderate-severe psoriasis treated with DMF. We assessed effectiveness (in terms of PASI50 and PASI75 in a intention to treat observation) and safety (occurrence of side effects) of DMF and their association with demographic and disease characteristics, mean daily dose taken and treatment discontinuation. RESULTS We included 103 patients, 78 (75.72%) had at least one comorbidity including 19 (18.44%) with a history of cancer; the mean treatment duration was 23.61 ± 17.99 weeks (min 4, max 130) and the mean daily dose was 262.13 ± 190.94 mg. Twenty-four patients (23.30%) reached PASI75 at week 12, while a further 18 patients (17.47%) reached it at week 26. Side effects occurred in 63 patients (61.16%), the most frequent were: diarrhea, epigastric discomfort, nausea and flushing. Sixteen patients (15.53%) showed an alteration of laboratory tests. In some cases side effects were transitory, while in 53 patients (51.45%) they led to cessation of therapy. The median daily dose showed a direct association with PASI50 achievement and an indirect association with treatment discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS Our study shows the peculiarities of DMF in a real-world setting: effectiveness is often reached after 12 weeks of treatment and side effects could limit the continuation of the therapy but, at the same time, DMF has no major contraindications and, due to the wide range of dosage, it can allow both to manage side effects and to personalize the prescription for each patient.

This review updates the current evidence base for management of depression in cancer, highlighting new research directions based on the inflammatory hypothesis of depression. RECENT FINDINGS Research on pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for depression in cancer has shown mixed efficacy partly because of methodological issues arising from the phenomenology of depression in cancer. After decades of stagnancy, more recent high-quality clinical trials are beginning to provide an evidence base to guide treatment. Inflammatory cytokine-associated depression is a subtype of depression that may have particular relevance in cancer, opening new avenues to explore therapeutic targets and biobehavioral impacts of interventions, which may improve cancer outcomes. SUMMARY The continuum of severity in cancer-related depression is important to consider in management approaches. Choice of treatment should be personalized to the patient and their symptom profile as there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend any particular medication or psychotherapy over another. Psychological interventions should be considered first line for mild-to-moderate depression, and pharmacological treatment added for more severe depression, which can be optimally delivered within a collaborative care model.

The present study investigates the effect of 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (GRA) a pentacyclic triterpenoid of the β-amyrin type, isolated from the root of Licorice (Glycyrrhizza glabra) on human breast cancer cells, MCF-7. GRA showed potent inhibitory effects on MCF-7 proliferation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner without affecting immortalized normal mammary epithelial cell line (MCF-10A). Growth inhibition of MCF-7 cells by GRA occurred through apoptosis, as evident from phosphatidyl serine externalization and DNA fragmentation. Apoptosis was primarily mediated through mitochondrial death cascade as evidenced by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase-9. GRA induced an increase in Bax:Bcl-2 ratio along with a significant increase in the protein level of the BH3 protein Bim. SiRNA-mediated knock down of Bim markedly attenuated GRA-mediated apoptosis. Profiling of transcriptional regulators of Bim revealed a role of Forkhead box O 3a transcription factor (FOXO3a) as judged by increased expression and nuclear translocation of FOXO3a. Silencing of FOXO3a resulted in marked attenuation in the expression of Bim as well as protection against GRA-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, GRA-induced activation and nuclear localization of FOXO3a was associated with a reduced activity of Akt kinase. These results suggest that GRA induces apoptosis in human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells via caspase activation and modulation of Akt/FOXO3a pathway.","Sharma, Gunjan; Kar, Susanta; Palit, Shreyasi; Das, Pijush K",Journal of cellular physiology,50,1

Whether the reverse is true when BMI is less than 18.5 kg m is unclear. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to investigate whether a BMI less than 25 kg m affects the duration of rocuronium in doses adjusted for actual body weight. DESIGN A prospective, observational, single-centre study. SETTING The operating room of a teaching hospital from 1 June 2008 to 30 June 2015. PATIENTS Thirty patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II who were scheduled to undergo elective surgery (BMI < 25 kg m, aged 23 to 74 years) maintained by 0.7 minimum alveolar concentration sevoflurane and remifentanil. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Repetitive train-of-four stimulation was applied and contractions of the adductor pollicis muscle were recorded. Duration of the initial dose of rocuronium (D1) was defined as the time from injection of rocuronium 0.6 mg kg to return of first twitch height to 25% of the control. Duration of additional doses (D2) was the time from a supplement of 0.15 mg kg rocuronium to return of first twitch height to 25% of the control. The relationship between D1 or D2 and BMI was examined using linear regression analysis. RESULTS Linear regression analysis revealed a significant correlation between duration of initial dose and BMI (R = 0.246; P = 0.00531). A significant correlation between the duration of the additional dose and BMI was also found (R = 0.316; P = 0.00122). CONCLUSION The lower the BMI, the shorter the duration of rocuronium at initial and additional doses determined by the actual body weight in adult patients with a BMI less than 25 kg m.

METHODS We did a systemic search of PubMed and Cochrane review for all randomized controlled trials and comparative trials that compared the efficacy and safety between LESS-TEP and MP-TEP. The evaluated outcomes included perioperative parameters (operative time, conversion rate), hospital stay and complications (seroma, delayed return of bladder function, postoperative pain and recurrence). The Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager software (RevMan, version 5.2.6) was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS There were 10 trials met the inclusion criteria and included for meta-analysis. Totally, there were 595 and 514 patients underwent LESS-TEP and MP-TEP, respectively. The LESS-TEP took significantly longer-operative time than the MP-TEP in unilateral hernia repair (weighted mean difference (WMD) 4.11 min, 95% CI 0.76-7.46, p = 0.02) while not in bilateral hernia repair (WMD 3.87 min, 95% of CI -2.59-10.33, z = 1.17, p = 0.24). There were no significant differences in surgical outcomes with regard to postoperative pain scale, conversion rate, hospital stay, recurrence rate and complication rate between two groups. The length of the sub-umbilical wound was the same in both groups. The result of cosmesis was not compared because of the limited data. CONCLUSION In experienced hands, LESS-TEP is a feasible alternative to MP-TEP with comparable surgical efficacy and morbidity, but with longer operation time in unilateral hernia repair. Potential advantages of LESS-TEP including better cosmesis, less postoperative pain and less trocar-associated complications were not clearly shown.","Lo, Chi-Wen; Yang, Stephen Shei-Dei; Tsai, Yao-Chou; Hsieh, Cheng-Hsing; Chang, Shang-Jen",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,50,16

We performed right inguinal lymph node dissection and total laparoscopic splenectomy in the supine position followed by transvaginal specimen extraction (TVSE). First, using three ports, we extracted the right inguinal lymph node. We repaired the posterior wall of the inguinal canal using a mesh plug. We added two ports and displaced the spleen from the retroperitoneum and lifted it using a snake retractor, disconnecting the hilum using an automatic suturing device.

BACKGROUND Tricuspid regurgitation is a malignant disease with high surgical mortality and no commercially available transcatheter solution in the US. METHODS Two iterations of PASTA were tested using trans-apical or trans-jugular access in swine. Catheters directed paired coronary guidewires to septal and lateral targets on the tricuspid annulus under fluoroscopic and echocardiographic guidance. Guidewires were electrified to traverse the annular targets and exchanged for pledgeted sutures. The sutures were drawn together and knotted, apposing septal and lateral targets, creating a double orifice tricuspid valve. RESULTS Twenty-two pigs underwent PASTA. Annular and chamber dimensions were reduced (annular area, 10.1 ± 0.8 cm2 to 3.8 ± 1.5 cm2 (naïve) and 13.1 ± 1.5 cm2 to 6.2 ± 1.0 cm2 (diseased); septal-lateral diameter, 3.9 ± 0.3 mm to 1.4 ± 0.6 mm (naïve) and 4.4 ± 0.4 mm to 1.7 ± 1.0 mm (diseased); and right ventricular end-diastolic volume, 94 ± 13 ml to 85 ± 14 ml (naïve) and 157 ± 25 ml to 143 ± 20 ml (diseased)). MRI derived tricuspid regurgitation fraction fell from 32 ± 12% to 4 ± 5%. Results were sustained at 30 days. Pledget pull-through force was five-fold higher (40.6 ± 11.7N vs 8.0 ± 2.6N, P < .01) using this strategy compared to single puncture techniques used to anchor current investigational devices. Serious complications were related to apical access. CONCLUSIONS PASTA reduces annular dimensions and tricuspid regurgitation in pigs. It may be cautiously applied to selected patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation and no options. This is the first transcatheter procedure, to our knowledge, to deliver standard pledgeted sutures to repair cardiac pathology.","Khan, Jaffar M; Rogers, Toby; Schenke, William H; Greenbaum, Adam B; Babaliaros, Vasilis C; Paone, Gaetano; Ramasawmy, Rajiv; Chen, Marcus Y; Herzka, Daniel A; Lederman, Robert J",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,50,1

As of September 2020, more than 750 completed, ongoing, or planned clinical trials of drugs intended to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication have been registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov or WHO International Clinical Trials Platform websites. Most of the treatments studied in these trials are repurposed licensed or investigational drugs targeting viral proteins or cellular pathways required for virus replication. The use of repurposed compounds is understandable because with the exception of monoclonal antibodies, it will be several months before novel SARS-CoV-2-specific drugs will be available for human testing. This editorial describes those compounds that I believe should be prioritized for clinical testing: i) viral RNA polymerase inhibitors including GS-441524, its prodrug remdesivir, and EIDD-2801; ii) entry inhibitors including monoclonal antibodies, ACE2 molecular decoys, and peptide fusion inhibitors; iii) parenteral and inhalational preparations of interferon β and λ; and iv) inhibitors of host transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), endosomal trafficking, and pyrimidine synthesis. As SARS-CoV-2 is pandemic and as its most severe consequences result from a dysregulated immunological response to infection, the ideal therapies should be inexpensive and should be able to be administered to non-hospitalized persons at the time of their initial diagnosis.","Shafer, Robert W",Global health & medicine,50,23

A feared complication is stapler line leak. Buttressing materials have been suggested as a means of reducing staple line leak rates. We analyzed the leak rates from published series to help in demonstrating a potential cause. METHODS The study was institutional review board (IRB) approved retrospectively. A Medline search using the key words sleeve gastrectomy and bariatric surgery obtained 54 articles. Attention was restricted to 11 articles written in English that listed numbers of gastrectomy procedures and leaks. Poisson regression assessed the possibility that patients who received buttressing materials had a reduced rate of leaks. RESULTS Thirty-five patients were evaluated from Greece (15) and the United States (20); two patients developed staple line leaks that appeared to be related to problems associated with buttressing materials. Eleven prior studies and the present series yielded 1,589 procedures, 15 (0.94%) of which were complicated by leaks. The leak rate for patients who were known to have received reinforcement of some sort was 1.45 (95% confidence interval 0.41-3.43) times that for other patients. To detect a difference between 1% and 0.5% as statistically significant in 80% of cases, with a two tailed test and alpha set at 0.05, would require 9,346 procedures. CONCLUSIONS There is no reason to believe, at this point, that reduction in leak rates occur because reinforcement is used. Because the leak rate is small, the routine reinforcement of the staple line after sleeve gastrectomy is questionable at best, although a decrease in hemorrhage has been reported.","Chen, Bo; Kiriakopoulos, Andreas; Tsakayannis, Dimitrios; Wachtel, Mitchell S; Linos, Dimitrios; Frezza, Eldo E",Obesity surgery,50,1

Corticosteroids are a possible therapeutic option. Objective To determine the effect of hydrocortisone on treatment failure on day 21 in critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and acute respiratory failure. Design, Setting, and Participants Multicenter randomized double-blind sequential trial conducted in France, with interim analyses planned every 50 patients. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for COVID-19-related acute respiratory failure were enrolled from March 7 to June 1, 2020, with last follow-up on June 29, 2020. The study intended to enroll 290 patients but was stopped early following the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board. Interventions Patients were randomized to receive low-dose hydrocortisone (n = 76) or placebo (n = 73). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome, treatment failure on day 21, was defined as death or persistent dependency on mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy. Prespecified secondary outcomes included the need for tracheal intubation (among patients not intubated at baseline); cumulative incidences (until day 21) of prone position sessions, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and inhaled nitric oxide; Pao2:Fio2 ratio measured daily from day 1 to day 7, then on days 14 and 21; and the proportion of patients with secondary infections during their ICU stay. Results The study was stopped after 149 patients (mean age, 62.2 years; 30.2% women; 81.2% mechanically ventilated) were enrolled. One hundred forty-eight patients (99.3%) completed the study, and there were 69 treatment failure events, including 11 deaths in the hydrocortisone group and 20 deaths in the placebo group. The primary outcome, treatment failure on day 21, occurred in 32 of 76 patients (42.1%) in the hydrocortisone group compared with 37 of 73 (50.7%) in the placebo group (difference of proportions, -8.6% [95.48% CI, -24.9% to 7.7%]; P = .29). Of the 4 prespecified secondary outcomes, none showed a significant difference. No serious adverse events were related to the study treatment. Conclusions and Relevance In this study of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure, low-dose hydrocortisone, compared with placebo, did not significantly reduce treatment failure (defined as death or persistent respiratory support) at day 21. However, the study was stopped early and likely was underpowered to find a statistically and clinically important difference in the primary outcome.

Exonucleolysis by Trf5-assisted nuclear exosome and cytoplasmic deadenylases trim the tails to 40 adenosines on average. Surprisingly, PAN2/3 and CCR4-NOT deadenylase complexes have a large pool of non-overlapping substrates mainly defined by expression level. Finally, we demonstrate that mRNA poly(A) tail length strongly responds to growth conditions, such as heat and nutrient deprivation.","Tudek, Agnieszka; Krawczyk, Paweł S; Mroczek, Seweryn; Tomecki, Rafał; Turtola, Matti; Matylla-Kulińska, Katarzyna; Jensen, Torben Heick; Dziembowski, Andrzej",Nature communications,50,1

It begins in the external ear canal and spreads to adjacent structures. This study investigated the clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed and treated for MEO and analyzed factors affecting patient outcomes. STUDY DESIGN Historical cohort. SETTING Tertiary medical center. METHODS Medical records of all patients diagnosed and treated for MEO from 1990 to 2013, were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical features, laboratory, imaging and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS 88 patients were included, mean age was 73±11.5years, 61 (69%) were male. Of these, 75% had diabetes. Mean follow-up was 60months. The most common presenting symptoms were otalgia (89%), external ear canal edema (86%) and otorrhea (84%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in 61% of ear cultures. All patients were treated with antibiotics, 22% had surgery and 8% hyperbaric oxygen. Overall survival rate was 38% in 5years, with disease specific mortality 14%. DM, facial nerve palsy, positive CT scan and age above 70 were found to correlate and predict disease-specific mortality. CONCLUSIONS MEO carries a grave prognosis. The presence of two or more of the following features, DM, facial nerve palsy, positive CT scan and age above 70, predicts poor outcome, and highlights the need for prolonged, vigorous treatment.","Stern Shavit, Sagit; Soudry, Ethan; Hamzany, Yaniv; Nageris, Ben",American journal of otolaryngology,50,1

RECENT FINDINGS Robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery is increasingly becoming a standard skillset in the urologist's technical armamentarium. The current state of the robotic surgery market is monopolized because of a number of regulatory and technical factors but there are several robotic surgical systems approved for clinical use across the world and numerous others in development. Next-generation surgical systems commonly include a modular design, open access consoles, haptic feedback, smaller instruments, and machine learning. SUMMARY Numerous robotic surgical systems are in development, and several have recently been introduced into clinical practice. These new technologies are changing the landscape of robotic surgery in urology and will likely transform the marketplace of robotic surgery across surgical subspecialties within the next 10--20 years.","Cisu, Theodore; Crocerossa, Fabio; Carbonara, Umberto; Porpiglia, Francesco; Autorino, Riccardo",Current opinion in urology,50,25

For example, CORT could alter the rate of contacts among hosts, pathogens and vectors through its widespread effects on host metabolism and activity levels. CORT could also affect the intensity and duration of pathogen shedding and risk of host mortality during infection. We experimentally manipulated songbird CORT, asking how CORT affected behavioural and physiological responses to a standardized West Nile virus (WNV) challenge. Although all birds became infected after exposure to the virus, only birds with elevated CORT had viral loads at or above the infectious threshold. Moreover, though the rate of mortality was faster in birds with elevated CORT compared with controls, most hosts with elevated CORT survived past the day of peak infectiousness. CORT concentrations just prior to inoculation with WNV and anti-inflammatory cytokine concentrations following viral exposure were predictive of individual duration of infectiousness and the ability to maintain physical performance during infection (i.e. tolerance), revealing putative biomarkers of competence. Collectively, our results suggest that glucocorticoid stress hormones could directly and indirectly mediate the spread of pathogens.","Gervasi, Stephanie S; Burgan, Sarah C; Hofmeister, Erik; Unnasch, Thomas R; Martin, Lynn B",Proceedings.

Thus, the study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes hospitalized during the first wave of the pandemic and the prevalence of new onset diabetes among patients with evidence of COVID-19 infection. METHODS A single-center surveillance study included all patients with diabetes admitted to Children's Hospital, Ain Shams University, in Egypt between May to August 2020. Data were collected to evaluate patients' clinical and laboratory characteristics as well as their outcomes. RESULTS Thirty-six patients were admitted during the study period. The mean age was 8.4 ± 3.8 years. Patients presented late to the emergency department with a mean delay of 3.05 ± 1.19 days from onset of symptoms. 34/36 patients presented in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), 50% presenting in severe DKA. Almost 81% of the patients were newly diagnosed. During the study period, SARS-CoV-2 PCR was found positive in four patients, COVID Ig M antibodies were positive in another two patients; all were symptomatic requiring ICU admission. Four patients showed a picture suggestive of the multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C); cardiac affection was a constant feature. CONCLUSIONS The pandemic affected both the prevalence and severity of DKA among pediatric patients. The increased prevalence of severe DKA could be partly related to delayed hospital admission or the effect of COVID-19 in triggering DKA. Efforts should be done to continuously raise awareness about diabetes in children as well as the importance of seeking timely medical guidance.","Sherif, Eman Monir; Elhenawy, Yasmine Ibrahim; Matter, Randa Mahmoud; Aly, Hanan Hassan; Thabet, Rasha Adel; Fereig, Yasmeen Abdelaziz",Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,50,28

Reducing this source of mortality requires knowledge of important behavioral, meteorological, and anthropogenic factors, yet we lack an understanding of the interacting roles of migration, artificial lighting, and weather conditions in causing fatal bird collisions. Using two decades of collision surveys and concurrent weather and migration measures, we model numbers of collisions occurring at a large urban building in Chicago. We find that the magnitude of nocturnal bird migration, building light output, and wind conditions are the most important predictors of fatal collisions. The greatest mortality occurred when the building was brightly lit during large nocturnal migration events and when winds concentrated birds along the Chicago lakeshore. We estimate that halving lighted window area decreases collision counts by 11× in spring and 6× in fall. Bird mortality could be reduced by ∼60% at this site by decreasing lighted window area to minimum levels historically recorded. Our study provides strong support for a relationship between nocturnal migration magnitude and urban bird mortality, mediated by light pollution and local atmospheric conditions. Although our research focuses on a single site, our findings have global implications for reducing or eliminating a critically important cause of bird mortality.","Van Doren, Benjamin M; Willard, David E; Hennen, Mary; Horton, Kyle G; Stuber, Erica F; Sheldon, Daniel; Sivakumar, Ashwin H; Wang, Julia; Farnsworth, Andrew; Winger, Benjamin M",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,50,31

Secondary, differences in effectiveness are explored regarding multi-behaviour interventions versus single-behaviour interventions targeting SC or AM only. METHODS A systematic search of PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted. Intervention studies with and without control groups, and randomised controlled trials were included. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted for the main outcomes: SC and AM rates at the follow-up closest to 6 months. Using subgroup-analyses and meta-regression, effectiveness of single-behaviour versus multi-behaviour interventions was evaluated. RESULTS A total of 17 studies with 3,796 participants; 9 studies on SC only, 8 studies on multi-behaviour interventions including an SC or AM module, and no studies on AM only were included. All studies had at least some concerns regarding bias. Distance-based SC interventions led to higher cessation rates than control conditions (10 studies, OR=1.56, 95%CI 1.13-2.15, p=.007). Single-behaviour SC interventions reduced smoking rates compared to baseline (RD=0.29 95%CI 0.19-0.39, p<.0001), but multi-behaviour interventions did not (RD=0.13 95%CI -0.05-0.31, p=0.15). There was insufficient evidence that distance-based multi-behaviour interventions reduced alcohol use compared to controls (3 studies, SMD=0.12, 95%CI -0.08-0.31, p=.24). CONCLUSIONS Distance-based SC interventions are effective in supporting SC among cancer survivors. Single-behaviour SC interventions appear more effective than multi-behaviour interventions. No evidence was found for the effectiveness of distance-based AM interventions for cancer survivors.","Mujcic, Ajla; Blankers, Matthijs; Bommelé, Jeroen; Boon, Brigitte; Berman, Anne H; Verdonck, Irma; van Laar, Margriet; Engels, Rutger",Psycho-oncology,50,29

Our surgeons recently experienced several independent adverse events involving the laparoscopic linear stapler. Although the Food and Drug Administration maintains a Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database to track such voluntary reports, many events are not reported and the true incidence of adverse events is unknown. We attempted to determine how frequently minimally invasive surgeons have experienced technical problems with a laparoscopic stapler. METHODS Following IRB approval, we electronically distributed an anonymous 10-question survey to the 124 minimally invasive program directors listed in the Fellowship Council database. The questions focused on personal or peer experience with laparoscopic stapler malfunction, frequency and type of malfunction, device manufacturer, whether the operation was altered, and root cause analysis of the event. RESULTS Forty-four of the 124 program directors (35%) completed the survey. The majority reported personal or peer experience (86%) with a linear stapler not releasing (66%) or not firing (73%) after application, with 27% of the respondents noting that this occurred three or more times. The malfunction was not related to type of load, straight (23%) or reticulating (32%) model, or manufacturer (Ethicon 30%, Covidien 36%). One quarter of the respondents noted that the malfunction caused them to significantly alter their operative procedure, and 30% reported that they received no helpful feedback from the manufacturer despite contacting it. CONCLUSIONS Most minimally invasive surgeons have experienced laparoscopic linear stapler malfunction and 25% have had to significantly alter the planned operative procedure due to the malfunction.","Kwazneski, Douglas; Six, Cheryl; Stahlfeld, Kurt",Surgical endoscopy,50,16

We sought to determine if adding capnography to standard monitoring during sedation of children increased the frequency of interventions for hypoventilation, and whether these interventions would decrease the frequency of oxygen desaturations. METHODS We enrolled 154 children receiving procedural sedation in a pediatric emergency department. All subjects received standard monitoring and capnography, but were randomized to whether staff could view the capnography monitor (intervention) or were blinded to it (controls). Primary outcome were the rate of interventions provided by staff for hypoventilation and the rate of oxygen desaturation less than 95%. RESULTS Seventy-seven children were randomized to each group. Forty-five percent had at least 1 episode of hypoventilation. The rate of hypoventilation per minute was significantly higher among controls (7.1% vs 1.0%, P = .008). There were significantly fewer interventions in the intervention group than in the control group (odds ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-0.50). Interventions were more likely to occur contemporaneously with hypoventilation in the intervention group (2.26; 95% CI, 1.34-3.81). Interventions not in time with hypoventilation were associated with higher odds of oxygen desaturation less than 95% (odds ratio, 5.31; 95% CI, 2.76-10.22). CONCLUSION Hypoventilation is common during sedation of pediatric emergency department patients. This can be difficult to detect by current monitoring methods other than capnography. Providers with access to capnography provided fewer but more timely interventions for hypoventilation. This led to fewer episodes of hypoventilation and of oxygen desaturation.","Langhan, Melissa L; Shabanova, Veronika; Li, Fang-Yong; Bernstein, Steven L; Shapiro, Eugene D",The American journal of emergency medicine,50,1

METHODS Direct anthropometry was used to document nasolabial dimensions before and immediately after repair in 51 infants with bilateral incomplete cleft lip. Technical details were analyzed in 48 patients; serial anthropometry was plotted in 22 male patients aged 2 to 20 years and compared to Farkas's normal growth lines. Revisions were also documented (n = 46). RESULTS Nasal width was made narrow and widened to normal by adolescence. Nasal tip protrusion was elongated and grew parallel to normal. Columellar length was constructed above normal, lengthened slowly in childhood, and was slightly short by adulthood. The Cupid's bow was designed narrow, widened slightly, and maintained normal dimension in adulthood. The upper philtrum was tapered and remained less wide than the lower philtrum. Although maximum available cutaneous prolabium was used in repair, it was short postoperatively and philtral height failed to exhibit catchup growth. The median tubercle was constructed overly full, but growth frequently fell behind in adolescence; 39 percent of patients required secondary augmentation. Total upper labial height closely followed the normal growth curve. CONCLUSIONS Serial anthropometry documented postoperative changes in nasolabial dimensions compared with normal growth lines.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate its usefulness in the follow-up of treated brain AVM. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with treated brain AVM (embolization, radiosurgery, and/or surgery) were investigated with both DSA (the ""gold standard"") and 4D MRA. Four-dimensional MRA was performed at 3T using a 4D sequence, combining contrast-enhanced timing-robust angiography, keyhole, and sensitivity encoding techniques. Examinations were evaluated by 2 independent readers and disagreements were resolved by a third reader. Interobserver and intermodality agreement with respect to residual nidus, residual venous drainage, and brain AVM patency were determined. RESULTS Between May 2008 and February 2013, 37 patients with a median age of 45 years (interquartile range = 26-55) were prospectively included. Examinations were acquired 36 months (IQR = 10-45.5) after the last treatment. Interobserver agreement for brain AVM patency was very good for both 4D MRA (κ 0.82, 95% CI .67-.98) and DSA (κ 0.84, 95% CI .69-.98). After consensus reading, intermodality agreement for the evaluation of brain AVM patency was good (κ 0.73, 95% CI .55-.90). Diagnostic accuracy of 4D MRA for residual brain AVM compared with DSA, reached a sensitivity of 73.7%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100%, and negative predictive value 78.3%. Agreements by technique of treatment are also detailed. CONCLUSIONS Four-dimensional MRA is a useful radiation-free technique for the follow-up of patients with treated brain AVM, especially patients treated by radiosurgery. However, given its actual limitations it is not sufficient to assert the cure; DSA remains mandatory for this purpose.","Soize, S; Bouquigny, F; Kadziolka, K; Portefaix, C; Pierot, L",AJNR.

Since the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is affecting the most multimorbid individuals, we might expect that the epidemic will be particularly problematic for people with MD. Understanding the burden of an outbreak on mental health is fundamental to effective action towards containing the spread of the disease, as psychopathology might reduce endurance during the lockdown. This can potentially reduce adhesion to ongoing treatment resulting in avoidable recurrence of a disorder. Additionally, there is the stress caused by the eminent risk of infection or economic uncertainty, especially in low-middle income settings.

However, whether the combined use of miR-124 and growth factors can increase the expression of neural related markers in human dental pulp stem cells has been remained unknown so far. In this study, human dental pulp stem cells were transfected with miR-124 following treatment with brain-derived neurotrophic factor or epidermal growth factor/basic fibroblast growth factor. The expression of some neural related markers (nestin, SOX2, β-tubulin III, MAP2, and peripherin) was analyzed in two groups by qRT-PCR or immunofluorescence. Cellular treatment resulted in morphological changes including neurosphere-like colonies formation. Nestin and SOX2 were up-regulated, and MAP2 and peripherin were down-regulated in dental pulp stem cells transfected by miR-124 following treatment with brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Replacement of brain-derived neurotrophic factor with epidermal growth factor/ basic fibroblast growth factor resulted in the up-regulation of nestin, MAP2, peripherin, and β-tubulin III and down-regulation of SOX2. The expression of SOX2 and nestin was also confirmed by immunofluorescence. The combination of miR-124 and growth factors would provide a promising starting point for upregulating the neural progenitor markers in human dental pulp stem cells.","Mehri Ghahfarrokhi, Ameneh; Jami, Mohammad Saeid; Hashemzadeh Chaleshtori, Morteza",International journal of molecular and cellular medicine,50,1

METHODS A prospective monitoring system was implemented to monitor CEA outcomes at a major academic medical centre. Independent, trained monitors from the neurology department examined all patients undergoing CEA preoperatively and postoperatively at 24 h and 30 days. Clinical variables were analysed to identify risk factors for CHS, which was defined as cases with postoperative development of a severe headache, new neurological deficits without infarction, seizure or intracerebral haemorrhage. RESULTS Between 2008 and 2010, 841 CEAs were monitored and CHS occurred in 14 (1.7%) subjects, including seizures in 5 (0.6%) and intracerebral haemorrhage in 4 (0.5%). Univariate analysis identified a history of dyslipidaemia, coronary artery disease, diastolic blood pressure, intraoperative shunt use and non-elective CEA (performed during hospitalisation for a symptomatic ipsilateral stroke, transient ischaemic attack or amaurosis fugax) as potential risks for CHS (all p≤0.15); other variables-including the degree of ipsilateral and contralateral stenosis, operative time, intraoperative EEG slowing, history of prior CEA or carotid stent and time from prior carotid interventions- were not significant. Logistic regression confirmed the risk association between non-elective CEA and CHS (p=0.046). CONCLUSIONS Independent, prospective monitoring of a large cohort of CEA cases identified a brief time interval between ischaemic symptoms and endarterectomy as the clearest risk factor for CHS.","Maas, Matthew B; Kwolek, Christopher J; Hirsch, Joshua A; Jaff, Michael R; Rordorf, Guy A","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",50,5

Although GOAT is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity and diabetes and plays a key role in other physiologic processes, little is known about its structure or mechanism. GOAT is a member of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) family, a group of polytopic integral membrane proteins involved in lipid-biosynthetic and lipid-signaling reactions from prokaryotes to humans. Here we use phylogeny and a variety of bioinformatic tools to predict the topology of GOAT. Using selective permeabilization indirect immunofluorescence microscopy in combination with glycosylation shift immunoblotting, we demonstrate that GOAT contains 11 transmembrane helices and one reentrant loop. Development of the V5Glyc tag, a novel, small, and sensitive dual topology reporter, facilitated these experiments. The MBOAT family invariant residue His-338 is in the ER lumen, consistent with other family members, but conserved Asn-307 is cytosolic, making it unlikely that both are involved in catalysis. Photocross-linking of synthetic ghrelin analogs and inhibitors demonstrates binding to the C-terminal region of GOAT, consistent with a role of His-338 in the active site. This knowledge of GOAT architecture is important for a deeper understanding of the mechanism of GOAT and other MBOATs and could ultimately advance the discovery of selective inhibitors for these enzymes.","Taylor, Martin S; Ruch, Travis R; Hsiao, Po-Yuan; Hwang, Yousang; Zhang, Pingfeng; Dai, Lixin; Huang, Cheng Ran Lisa; Berndsen, Christopher E; Kim, Min-Sik; Pandey, Akhilesh; Wolberger, Cynthia; Marmorstein, Ronen; Machamer, Carolyn; Boeke, Jef D; Cole, Philip A",The Journal of biological chemistry,50,29

However, it is unknown how this influences the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of patients involved in ongoing clinical research and medical care. For both the current and potential future lockdowns, it is important to determine if PROMs collected during such a period can be interpreted with confidence. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES (1) Is there a difference in quality of life between patients in the COVID-19 period group (March 23, 2020 to May 4, 2020) and patients in a reference period group (from the same period in 2018 or 2019)? (2) Is there a difference in pain, hand function, anxiety, depression, and illness perception between patients in the COVID-19 period group and patients in the reference period group? METHODS This study was part of a large cohort study with routine outcome measures of patients with hand and wrist conditions. To answer our research questions, we analyzed two samples, because not all PROMs were sent to participants at the same time points after treatment. The first sample consisted of all participants who completed PROMs on quality of life, pain, and hand function at their final follow-up time point, which was either 3, 6, or 12 months post-treatment. The second sample consisted of participants who completed PROMs 3 months post-treatment on anxiety, depression, and illness perception. Each sample consisted of two groups: a COVID-19 period group and a reference period group. We included 1613 participants in the first sample (COVID-19 period group: n = 616; reference period group: n = 997) and 535 participants in the second sample (COVID-19 period group: n = 313; reference period group: n = 222). The primary outcome was quality of life, expressed in the EuroQol 5-Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) index score. Secondary outcomes were the other domains on the EQ-5D, as well as pain, hand function, anxiety, depression, and illness perception. RESULTS We found no between-group differences in the EQ-5D index score (standardized mean difference 0.035; p = 0.98). Furthermore, there were no between-group differences in PROM scores for hand function, anxiety, or depression. There were, however, a few small differences in subdomain items regarding pain and illness perception, but we believe in aggregate that these are unlikely to make a clinically important difference in our main finding. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdown had no influence on quality of life and had little influence on secondary outcomes in participants who were part of the Hand-Wrist Study Cohort. This finding implies that PROMs data collected during this period can be used with confidence in clinical research. Our findings indicate that when a pandemic like this occurs again, we can continue to use PROMs for analysis in clinical research or routine outcome measures.

METHODS We aimed to investigate the comparative safety and efficacy of BT and dMT in AIS patients. We included all observational studies and post-hoc analyses from RCTs that provided data on the outcomes of AIS patients with LVO stratified by the IVT treatment status prior to MT. RESULTS We identified 38 eligible observational studies (11,798 LVO patients, mean age 68 years, 56% treated with BT). In unadjusted analyses BT was associated with a higher likelihood of three-month functional independence (OR=1.52,95%CI:1.32-1.76), three-month functional improvement (cOR for 1-point decrease in mRS-score=1.52,95%CI:1.18-1.97), early neurological improvement (OR=1.21,95%CI:1.83-1.76), successful recanalization (OR=1.22,95%CI:1.02-1.46) and successful recanalization with less than two device passes (OR=2.28,95%CI:1.43-3.64) compared to dMT. BT was also related to a lower likelihood of three-month mortality (OR=0.64, 95%CI: 0.57-0.73). In the adjusted analyses, BT was independently associated with a higher likelihood of three-month functional independence (adjusted OR=1.55, 95%CI:1.26-1.91) and a lower odds of three-month mortality (adjusted OR=0.80,95%CI:0.66-0.97) compared to dMT.

Early mobilization and rehabilitation programs offer a promising approach for mitigating the effects of PICS-p in oncology patients but have not yet been studied in this high-risk population. Methods We describe the development and feasibility of implementing an early mobility quality improvement initiative in a dedicated pediatric onco-critical care unit. Our primary outcomes include the percentage of patients with consults for rehabilitation services within 72 h of admission, the percentage of patients who are mobilized within 72 h of admission, and the percentage of patients with a positive delirium screen after 48 h of admission. Results Between January 2019 and June 2020, we significantly increased the proportion of patients with consults ordered for rehabilitation services within 72 h of admission from 25 to 56% (p<0.001), increased the percentage of patients who were mobilized within 72 h of admission to the intensive care unit from 21 to 30% (p=0.02), and observed a decrease in patients with positive delirium screens from 43 to 37% (p=0.46). The early mobility initiative was not associated with an increase in unplanned extubations, unintentional removal of central venous catheters, or injury to patient or staff. Conclusions Our experience supports the safety and feasibility of early mobility initiatives in pediatric onco-critical care.

METHODS Systematic review of all existing studies comparing arm and leg BP measurements. A search strategy was designed in MEDLINE and adapted to be run across six further databases. Articles were deemed eligible for inclusion if they measured and reported arm and leg BP taken in the supine position and/or the difference between the two. Mean values for arm-leg BP difference and measures of precision [95% confidence intervals (CIs) or SD] were extracted and entered into a random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS A total of 887 articles were screened and 44 were included in the descriptive analyses, including 9771 patients. In the general population, ankle SBP was 17.0 mmHg (95% CI 15.4-21.3 mmHg) higher than arm BP in the supine position. For DBP, there was no difference between arm and ankle BP (-0.3 mmHg, 95% CI -1.5-1.0 mmHg). In patients with vascular disease, SBP was -33.3 mmHg (95% CI -59.1 to -7.6 mmHg) lower in the ankle compared with the arm. CONCLUSION This is the first review to provide empirical data defining the difference between BP in the arm and leg in the general population. Findings suggest a diagnostic threshold of 155/90 mmHg could be used for diagnosing hypertension when only ankle measurements are available in routine practice.","Sheppard, James P; Albasri, Ali; Franssen, Marloes; Fletcher, Ben; Pealing, Louise; Roberts, Nia; Obeid, Amira; Pucci, Mark; McManus, Richard J; Martin, Una",Journal of hypertension,50,1

Previous studies have investigated the prevalence of Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) among wild animal species, but comprehensive data are needed to assess the role that these animals have in the transmission of STEC infections to the human population via faecal contamination of the environment, agri-food or water chain. Due to the nature of these microorganisms in which this human-animal-environment interface plays a relevant role on the disease's dynamics, a ""One Health"" approach is needed to prevent and control the worldwide spread. The aim of this study was to review the published research on the prevalence of STEC in wildlife. The search was performed using several online databases consisting of three blocks of specific search terms covering pathogen, type of study and population. Two reviewers applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to screening and eligibility phases. Two hundred and twenty-five abstracts were screened for relevance, and 72 were included for data analysis. Most studies (77.8%) investigated the prevalence of STEC in ruminants and urban birds. Their role in transmitting the pathogen to humans, other animals and the agri-food chain is potentiated by the peculiar biological characteristics in ruminants and improved adaptation of urban birds to urban environments. The popularity of convenience and voluntary response sampling may be due to the lack of human-made boundaries on the wild animal species' habitat and having some samples from hunted-harvested animals. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review on STEC prevalence in wild animal species from studies conducted across the globe. We recommend that future research includes and compares samples from varying origins (i.e., human, animal, environment and food) and applies a ""One Health"" approach to the emerging challenges that STEC poses to public health.","Espinosa, Laura; Gray, Aimée; Duffy, Geraldine; Fanning, Séamus; McMahon, Barry J",Zoonoses and public health,50,23

For this system, the effective self-propelling method, which should be powered wirelessly and controllable in 3-D space, is of paramount importance. This article describes a bubble-powered swimming microdrone that can navigate in 3-D space in a controlled manner. To enable 3-D propulsion with steering capability, air bubbles of three lengths are trapped in microtubes that are embedded and three-dimensionally aligned inside the drone body using two-photon polymerization. These bubbles can generate on-demand 3-D propulsion through microstreaming when they are selectively excited at their individual resonance frequencies that depend on the bubble sizes. In order to equip the drone with highly stable maneuverability, a non-uniform mass distribution of the drone body is carefully designed to spontaneously restore the drone to the upright position from disturbances. A mathematical model of the restoration mechanism is developed to predict the restoration behavior showing a good agreement with the experimental data. The present swimming microdrone potentially lends itself to a robust 3-D maneuverable microscale mobile cargo navigating in vitro and in vivo for biomedical applications.","Liu, Fang-Wei; Cho, Sung Kwon",Lab on a chip,50,30

The impact of non-RSV respiratory virus coinfection on the severity of RSV disease is unknown. METHODS This hospital-based prospective study was conducted in Nagasaki, Japan, on all children less than 5 years of age with acute respiratory infection (ARI) who had undergone a rapid RSV diagnostic test between April 2009 and March 2010. Thirteen respiratory viruses were identified from nasopharyngeal swab samples using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction; polymerase chain reaction-positive samples were considered as confirmed respiratory virus infections. The cases were classified into 3 categories (pneumonia, moderate-to-severe nonpneumonic ARI and mild ARI) according to the findings of the chest radiograph and the hospitalization records. RESULTS Among 384 cases enrolled, 371 were eligible for analysis, of whom 85 (23%) were classified as pneumonia cases; 137 (37%) as moderate-to-severe nonpneumonic ARI cases and 162 (40%) as mild ARI cases. RSV was detected in 172 cases (61.6%), and 31 cases (18.0%) had double or triple infections with other respiratory viruses. RSV infection was more frequently observed in pneumonia cases (odds ratio [OR]: 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.31-3.9) and moderate-to-severe nonpneumonic ARI cases (OR: 2.95; 95% CI: 1.82-4.78) than in mild ARI cases. The association with moderate-to-severe nonpneumonic ARI cases was stronger with RSV/non-RSV respiratory virus coinfection (adjusted OR: 4.91; 95% CI: 1.9-12.7) than with RSV single infection (adjusted OR: 2.77; 95% CI: 1.64-4.7). CONCLUSIONS Non-RSV respiratory virus coinfection is not uncommon in RSV-infected children and may increase the severity of RSV disease.","Harada, Yoshitaka; Kinoshita, Fumiko; Yoshida, Lay Myint; Minh, Le Nhat; Suzuki, Motoi; Morimoto, Konosuke; Toku, Yuichirou; Tomimasu, Kunio; Moriuchi, Hiroyuki; Ariyoshi, Koya",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,50,27

Although its pathophysiology is poorly understood, multiple factors associated with delirium have been identified, many of which are coincident with critical illness. To date, no drug or non-drug treatments have been shown to improve outcomes in patients with delirium. Clinical trials have provided a limited understanding of the contributions of multiple triggers and processes of intensive care unit (ICU) acquired delirium, making identification of therapies difficult. Delirium is independently associated with poor long term outcomes, including persistent cognitive impairment. A longer duration of delirium is associated with worse long term cognition after adjustment for age, education, pre-existing cognitive function, severity of illness, and exposure to sedatives. Interestingly, differences in prevalence are seen between ICU survivor populations, with survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome experiencing higher rates of cognitive impairment at early follow-up compared with mixed ICU survivor populations. Although cognitive performance improves over time for some ICU survivors, impairment is persistent in others. Studies have so far been unable to identify patients at higher risk of long term cognitive impairment; this is an active area of scientific investigation.","Wilcox, M Elizabeth; Girard, Timothy D; Hough, Catherine L",BMJ,50,8

MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-two MWA sessions (August 2015-March 2017) in 20 patients with primary pancreatic cancer (13 men, 7 women, mean-age: 59.9 ± 8.6 years, range: 46-73 years), who had given informed consent, were retrospectively evaluated. All procedures were performed percutaneously under CT-guidance using the same high-frequency (2.45-GHz) MWA device. Tumor location and diameter, ablation diameter and volume, roundness, duration, technical success and efficacy, output energy, complications, and local tumor progression defined as a tumor focus connected to the edge of a previously technically efficient ablation zone were collected. RESULTS Seventeen pancreatic malignant tumors (77.3%) were located in the pancreatic head and five (22.7%) in the pancreatic tail. Initial Mean Tumor Diameter was 30 ± 6 mm. Technical success and efficacy were idem (100%). No major complications occurred. Two patients (9.1%) showed minor complications of severe local pain related to MWA. Post-ablation diameter was on average 34.4 ± 5.8 mm. Mean ablation volume was 7.8 ± 3.8 cm³. The mean transverse roundness index was 0.74 ± 0.14. Mean ablation time was 2.6 ± 0.96 min. The mean applied energy per treatment was 9627 ± 3953 J. Local tumor progression was documented in one case (10%) of the 10/22 available three-month follow-up imaging studies. CONCLUSION High-frequency (2.45 GHz) microwave ablation (MWA) for treatment of unresectable and non-metastatic locally-advanced-pancreatic-cancer (LAPC) shows promising results regarding feasibility and safety of percutaneous approach after short-term follow-up and should be further evaluated.","Vogl, Thomas J; Panahi, Bita; Albrecht, Moritz H; Naguib, Nagy Naguib Naeem; Nour-Eldin, Nour-Eldin A; Gruber-Rouh, Tatjana; Thompson, Zachary M; Basten, Lajos M",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,50,19

DESIGN Observational study. SETTING Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Örebro University Hospital, Sweden. POPULATION Eighty-five patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy for benign or malignant indications between January and December 2012, with or without salpingo-oophorectomy. Outcomes were compared with all consecutive patients who had undergone the same surgery from January to December 2011, immediately before establishing the ERAS protocol (n = 120). METHODS The ERAS protocol was initiated in January 2012 as part of a targeted implementation program. Data were extracted from patient records and from a specific database. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Length of stay and the proportion of patients achieving target length of stay (2 days). RESULTS Length of stay was significantly reduced in the study population after introducing the ERAS protocol from a mean of 2.6 (SD 1.1) days to a mean of 2.3 (SD 1.2) days (p = 0.011). The proportion of patients discharged at 2 days was significantly increased from 56% pre-ERAS to 73% after ERAS (p = 0.012). No differences were found in complications (5% vs. 3.5% in primary stay, 12% vs. 15% within 30 days after discharge), reoperations (2% vs. 1%) or readmission (4% vs. 4%).

METHODS We reviewed all cases of NEWS and CLEAN-NET performed in the department of surgery of the Royal Vinohrady Teaching Hospital. RESULTS Our department performed 12 gastric tumor resections (NEWS, n=10 and CLEAN-NET, n=2) between March 2016 and February 2017. The cases chosen for these resections included predominantly submucosal tumors with no signs of dissemination or local invasion and early gastric carcinomas (T1SM1 and T1M), where tumor location made it impossible to use endoscopic submucosal dissection. R0 resection margins were confirmed in all the cases. CONCLUSIONS NEWS and CLEAN-NET allow en bloc non-exposed full-thickness gastric wall resection in a way that uses a ""close first, cut later"" approach to prevent seeding of the peritoneal cavity with tumor cells. These mini-invasive techniques combine laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques, and preserve the full function of the stomach.","Hajer, Jan; Havlůj, Lukáš; Whitley, Adam; Gürlich, Robert",Clinical endoscopy,50,10

A successful host response to viral infections critically depend on the initial activation of PRRs by viruses, mainly by viral DNA and RNA. The signalling pathways activated by PRRs leads to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, to recruit immune cells, and type I and type III interferons which leads to the induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISG), powerful virus restriction factors that establish the ""antiviral state"" . Inflammasomes contribute to anti-viral responses through the maturation of interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-18 and through triggering pyroptotic cell death. The activity of the innate immune system along with the adaptive immune response normally leads to successful virus elimination, although disproportionate innate responses contribute to viral pathology. In this review we will discuss recent insights into the influence of PRR activation and inflammasomes on viral infections and what this means for the mammalian host. We will also comment on how specific PRRs and inflammasomes may be relevant to how SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic, interacts with host innate immunity.","Carty, Michael; Guy, Coralie; Bowie, Andrew G",Biochemical pharmacology,50,1

Whether genetic events predicted to result in increased and constitutive signaling indeed lead to enhanced biological activity is often unclear and, due to technical challenges, unexplored. Here, we investigated proliferative signaling in CRC using a highly sensitive method for protein detection. The aim of the study was to determine whether multiple changes in proliferative signaling in CRC could be combined and exploited as a ""complex biomarker"" for diagnostic purposes. METHODS We used robotized capillary isoelectric focusing as well as conventional immunoblotting for the comprehensive analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathways converging on extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), AKT, phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) and c-SRC in normal mucosa compared with CRC stage II and IV. Computational analyses were used to test different activity patterns for the analyzed signal transducers. RESULTS Signaling pathways implicated in cell proliferation were differently dysregulated in CRC and, unexpectedly, several were downregulated in disease. Thus, levels of activated ERK1 (pERK1), but not pERK2, decreased in stage II and IV while total ERK1/2 expression remained unaffected. In addition, c-SRC expression was lower in CRC compared with normal tissues and phosphorylation on the activating residue Y418 was not detected. In contrast, PLCγ1 and AKT expression levels were elevated in disease. Immunoblotting of the different signal transducers, run in parallel to capillary isoelectric focusing, showed higher variability and lower sensitivity and resolution. Computational analyses showed that, while individual signaling changes lacked predictive power, using the combination of changes in three signaling components to create a ""complex biomarker"" allowed with very high accuracy, the correct diagnosis of tissues as either normal or cancerous. CONCLUSIONS We present techniques that allow rapid and sensitive determination of cancer signaling that can be used to differentiate colorectal cancer from normal tissue.","Padhan, Narendra; Nordling, Torbjörn E M; Sundström, Magnus; Åkerud, Peter; Birgisson, Helgi; Nygren, Peter; Nelander, Sven; Claesson-Welsh, Lena",BMC cancer,50,1

OBJECTIVES To analyze the impact of corticosteroid therapy on outcomes of patients having ARDS associated with influenza A/H1N1 pneumonia. METHODS Patients from the French registry of critically ill patients with influenza A/H1N1v 2009 infection were selected if fulfilling criteria for ARDS, excluding patients having other indication for corticosteroids, or decompensated underlying disease as the primary cause for intensive care unit admission. Survival to hospital discharge was analyzed using Cox regression, accounting for the time to administration of steroids, and after adjustment on the propensity for receiving steroid therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Of 208 patients with ARDS, 83 (39.9%) received corticosteroids (median initial dose of 270 mg equivalent hydrocortisone per day for a median of 11 d). Steroid therapy was associated with death, both in crude analysis (33.7 vs. 16.8%; hazard ratio, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.3; P = 0.004) and after propensity score-adjusted analysis (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.5-5.4; P = 0.002), controlling for an admission severity Simplified Acute Physiology Score, version 3, greater than 50, initial administration of vasopressors, and immunodepression. Early therapy (≤ 3 d of mechanical ventilation) appeared more strongly associated with mortality than late administration. Patients receiving steroids had more acquired pneumonia and a trend to a longer duration of ventilation. CONCLUSIONS Our study provides no evidence of a beneficial effect of corticosteroids in patients with ARDS secondary to influenza pneumonia, but suggests that very early corticosteroid therapy may be harmful.","Brun-Buisson, Christian; Richard, Jean-Christophe M; Mercat, Alain; Thiébaut, Anne C M; Brochard, Laurent",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,50,31

Predictors of institutional care admission from community-dwellers and people with dementia have been described, but those from the acute hospital setting have not been systematically reviewed. Our aim was to establish predictive factors for discharge to institutional care following acute hospitalisation. Methods we registered and conducted a systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42015023497). We searched MEDLINE; EMBASE and CINAHL Plus in September 2015. We included observational studies of patients admitted directly to long-term institutional care following acute hospitalisation where factors associated with institutionalisation were reported. Results from 9,176 records, we included 23 studies (n = 354,985 participants). Studies were heterogeneous, with the proportions discharged to a care home 3-77% (median 15%). Eleven studies (n = 12,642), of moderate to low quality, were included in the quantitative synthesis. The need for institutional long-term care was associated with age (pooled odds ratio (OR) 1.02, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.00-1.04), female sex (pooled OR 1.41, 95% CI: 1.03-1.92), dementia (pooled OR 2.14, 95% CI: 1.24-3.70) and functional dependency (pooled OR 2.06, 95% CI: 1.58-2.69). Conclusions discharge to long-term institutional care following acute hospitalisation is common, but current data do not allow prediction of who will make this transition. Potentially important predictors evaluated in community cohorts have not been examined in hospitalised cohorts. Understanding these predictors could help identify individuals at risk early in their admission, and support them in this transition or potentially intervene to reduce their risk.","Harrison, Jennifer Kirsty; Walesby, Katherine E; Hamilton, Lorna; Armstrong, Carolyn; Starr, John M; Reynish, Emma L; MacLullich, Alasdair M J; Quinn, Terry J; Shenkin, Susan D",Age and ageing,50,31

Nevertheless, controlled microscopic manipulation of ferroelectric domains is still rare in monolayer-thick 2D ferroelectrics with in-plane polarization. Here we report the discovery of robust ferroelectricity with a critical temperature close to 400 K in SnSe monolayer plates grown on graphene, and the demonstration of controlled room temperature ferroelectric domain manipulation by applying appropriate bias voltage pulses to the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). This study shows that STM is a powerful tool for detecting and manipulating the microscopic domain structures in 2D ferroelectric monolayers, which is difficult for conventional approaches such as piezoresponse force microscopy, thus facilitating the hunt for other 2D ferroelectric monolayers with in-plane polarization with important technological applications.","Chang, Kai; Küster, Felix; Miller, Brandon; Ji, Jing-Rong; Zhang, Jia-Lu; Sessi, Paolo; Barraza-Lopez, Salvador; Parkin, Stuart S P",Nano letters,50,1

METHODS From the beginning of 2010 until the end of 2014, 605 patients underwent a colectomy for sigmoid colon cancer. We compared the characteristics, postoperative outcomes, and pathologic results for the patients who underwent RPLS and for the patients who underwent MPLS. We also compared the clinical outcomes of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) and 3-port laparoscopic surgery. RESULTS Of the 115 patients in the RPLS group, 59 underwent SILS and 56 underwent 3-port laparoscopic surgery. The MPLS group included 490 patients. The RPLS group had shorter operating time (137.4 ± 43.2 minutes vs. 155.5 ± 47.9 minutes, P < 0.001) and shorter incision length (5.3 ± 2.2 cm vs. 7.8 ± 1.2 cm, P < 0.001) than the MPLS group. In analyses of SILS and 3-port laparoscopic surgery, the SILS group showed younger age, longer operating time, and shorter incision length than the 3-port surgery group and exhibited a more advanced T stage, more lymphatic invasion, and larger tumor size. CONCLUSION RPLS performed by 1 surgeon and 1 camera operator appears to be a feasible and safe surgical option for the treatment of patients with sigmoid colon cancer, showing comparable clinical outcomes with shorter operation time and shorter incision length than MPLS. SILS can be applied to patients with favorable tumor characteristics.","Oh, Jung Ryul; Park, Sung Chan; Park, Sung Sil; Sohn, Beonghoon; Oh, Hyoung Min; Kim, Bun; Kim, Min Jung; Hong, Chang Won; Han, Kyung Su; Sohn, Dae Kyung; Oh, Jae Hwan",Annals of coloproctology,50,26

The most promising interventions for increasing depression treatment initiation in primary care settings remain unclear. METHODS We performed a systematic search of publicly available databases from inception through August 2017 to identify interventions designed to increase depression treatment initiation. Two authors independently selected, extracted data, and rated risk of bias from included studies. Eligible studies used a randomized or pre-post design and assessed depression treatment initiation (i.e., ≥ 1 mental health visit or antidepressant fill) among adults, the majority of whom met criteria for depression. Interventions were classified as simple or complex and sub-classified into intervention strategies that were graded for strength of evidence. RESULTS Of 9516 articles identified, we included 14 unique studies representing 16 (4 simple and 12 complex) interventions and 8 treatment initiation strategies. We found low to moderate strength of evidence for collaborative/integrated care (3 studies), treatment preference matching (2 studies), and case management (2 studies) strategies. However, there was insufficient evidence to determine the benefit of cultural tailoring (2 studies), motivation (alone, with reminders or with cultural tailoring (5 studies)), education (1 study), and shared decision-making strategies (1 study). Overall, we found moderate strength of evidence for complex interventions (8 of 12 complex interventions demonstrated statistically significant effects on treatment initiation). DISCUSSION Collaborative/integrated care, preference treatment matching, and case management strategies had the best evidence for improving depression treatment initiation, but none of the strategies had high strength of evidence. While primary care settings can consider using some of these strategies when referring depressed patients to treatment, our review highlights the need for further rigorous research in this area.","Moise, Nathalie; Falzon, Louise; Obi, Megan; Ye, Siqin; Patel, Sapana; Gonzalez, Christopher; Bryant, Kelsey; Kronish, Ian M",Journal of general internal medicine,50,1

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain its etiology. Mitochondrial dysfunction (MD) is suggested to be one of the causes of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. The objective of the study was to evaluate the relationship between MD and ADHD by investigating mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) levels from peripheral blood leukocytes, one of the best biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction. SUBJECTS AND METHODS This study included 56 children aged 6-16 years who were diagnosed with ADHD for the first time and 56 age- and sex-matched children without ADHD. Real-time PCR was performed to determine the relative mtDNA copy number in each study participant. RESULTS The mean mtDNA copy number of the case group was 57.623±24.827 and that of the control group was 44.204±18.926 (p=0.002). The mtDNA copy number of the case group was higher than that of the control group. Results of ROC curve analysis provided a mtDNA cutoff value of 45. CONCLUSION Significantly higher mtDNA copy number in ADHD group may suggest mitochondrial dysfunction in the etiopathogenesis of ADHD.","Öğütlü, Hakan; Esin, İbrahim Selçuk; Erdem, Haktan Bağiş; Tatar, Abdülgani; Dursun, Onur Burak",Psychiatria Danubina,50,16

We retrospectively analyzed the early and late surgical outcomes of consecutive 168 laparoscopic total gastrectomy cases from April 2011 to December 2016. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The FEEA method was selected in 120 cases, and the overlap method was selected in 48 cases. The mean time of esophagojejunostomy for the FEEA and overlap method was 13.2 and 36.5 minutes, respectively. Two cases with FEEA method and 3 cases with overlap method experienced complications due to esophagojejunostomy leakage. These cases were treated without performing a reoperation. One case with FEEA method was complicated due to esophagojejunostomy stenosis. This case was endoscopically treated.

Their health care wishes may be ignored or disregarded, their families of choice are less likely to be included in their decision making, and they may experience increased isolation, bullying, mistreatment, or abuse, which ultimately contribute to receipt of poor-quality health care. This is particularly important during sensitive transitions along the care continuum to end-of-life settings; 43% of respondents of a 2018 survey of 865 hospice professionals reported having directly observed discriminatory behavior toward LGBT patients. Lack of visibility and accountability perpetuates vulnerabilities and the potential for discriminatory treatment. Unfortunately, while other areas of health care have prioritized and normalized collecting sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data, hospices do not routinely assess patients' SOGI in the context of end-of-life wishes and decisions. Drawing insight from a sample of 31 in-depth interviews with older LGBT adults, this paper focuses on one participant's story-Esther's. We chose her story to illustrate how care can be compromised at the end of life if an open discussion with patients about what and who matters most to them at the end of life, is avoided.","Candrian, Carey; Cloyes, Kristin G",The Gerontologist,50,11

The reported prevalence is 17-39% in ill referral patients. While the aetiology is poorly understood, it is known to include infectious, autoimmune and physical components. What is not known is whether different organs are affected by different diseases, or the same process; indeed, triaditis may be part of a multiorgan inflammatory disease. Feline gastrointestinal tract anatomy plays its role too. Specifically, the short small intestine, high bacterial load and anatomic feature whereby the pancreatic duct joins the common bile duct before entering the duodenal papilla all increase the risk of bacterial reflux and parenchymal inflammation. Inflammation may also be a sequela of bowel bacterial translocation and systemic bacteraemia. DIAGNOSTIC CHALLENGES Cholangitis, pancreatitis and IBD manifest with overlapping, vague and non-specific clinical signs. Cholangitis may be accompanied by increased serum liver enzymes, total bilirubin and bile acid concentrations, and variable ultrasonographic changes. A presumptive diagnosis of pancreatitis is based on increased serum pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity or feline pancreas-specific lipase, and/or abnormal pancreatic changes on ultrasonography, though these tests have low sensitivity. Diagnosis of IBD is challenging without histopathology; ultrasound findings vary from normal to mucosal thickening or loss of layering. Triaditis may cause decreased serum folate or cobalamin (B12) concentrations due to intestinal disease and/or pancreatitis. Triaditis can only be confirmed with histopathology; hence, it remains a presumptive diagnosis in most cases. EVIDENCE BASE The literature on feline triaditis, pancreatitis, cholangitis and IBD is reviewed, focusing on histopathology, clinical significance and diagnostic challenges. Current management recommendations are provided. Further studies are needed to understand the complex pathophysiology, and in turn improve diagnosis and treatment.","Černá, Petra; Kilpatrick, Scott; Gunn-Moore, Danielle A",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,50,14

Through virtual visits and check-ins, trusted health care providers can serve as a source of emotional support and psychosocial buffering for families under stress. By leveraging technology to deliver care remotely, telemedicine lets patients and providers connect, relate, and engage. Connection enables the conveyance of compassion and empathy.

However, instrument contamination during HD administration with the simple suspension method remains unclear. Therefore, to minimize such contamination during the simple suspension method using an injector, we propose the following exposure countermeasures method: (1) Wear two layers of gloves. (2) Prepare injectors for administration and flushing. (3) Use caps. (4) Replace outer gloves after the removal of tablets from the press-through package (PTP) sheet. (5) Handle drugs on a tray. (6) Inject while wrapping the connection site between the injector for administration and the tube with gauze. (7) Wrap the connection site between the injector and tube with gauze. (8) Do not point the injector downward. To establish whether these countermeasures method are effective, 16 ward nurses who routinely administer drugs via a feeding tube were enrolled as subjects. By visual evaluation, we compared differences in instrument contamination between a suspension using a medicine cup and administration via a feeding tube (the conventional method) and the exposure countermeasures method. Exposure with the countermeasures method under our instruction was markedly lower than that with the conventional method. Furthermore, after implementing the exposure countermeasures method, most nurses noted that caution and awareness of exposure countermeasures increased. Thus, to minimize exposure, we recommend the implementation of the exposure countermeasures method and increasing knowledge and awareness of measures against exposure.","Aoki, Manahito; Hamasaki, Yumi; Naya, Midori; Shishikura, Hiroki; Kato, Masahiro; Shibuya, Kiyoshi; Aoyagi, Meiko; Otori, Katsuya",Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,50,33

SETTING A 1,000-bed academic medical center in Northern Israel has faced two extreme challenges since 2006: operating under missile attack during the 2006 Second Lebanon War, and rapid establishment of a scalable infrastructure for COVID-19 patients. The first challenge led to construction of a dual-use facility: a parking lot during peacetime, and a fully functioning fortified underground emergency hospital (FUEH) in times of emergency. Several drills have confirmed readiness for various scenarios including conventional and unconventional warfare, and treating isolated patients during the Ebola and SARS threats. RESULTS The hospital achieved preparedness for patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic, including all facilities and personnel, including infrastructure, laboratories, and innovations, to maintain standard patient care and separate COVID-19 treatment facilities. The hospital's second challenge represented by the COVID-19 pandemic led to adaptation of the FUEH as a key strategic facility in Northern Israel for treating hundreds of COVID-19 patients. Each solution was supported by innovations targeted for specific purposes and needs. CONCLUSIONS The function and unique mechanisms used to leverage use of a dual facility was proven viable for several emergency conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Infrastructure and technological flexibility is essential when planning for handling different emergencies situations.","Halberthal, Michal; Berger, Gidon; Hussein, Khetam; Reisner, Shimon; Mekel, Michal; Horowitz, Netanel A; Shachor-Meyouhas, Yael; Geffen, Yuval; Hyams, Gila; Beyar, Rafael",American journal of disaster medicine,50,1

ANIMALS 40 neonatal calves that were healthy (n = 10) or had diarrhea (30). PROCEDURES The study was a cross-sectional study. Results of hematologic analyses and serum concentrations of intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP), liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), trefoil factor 3 (TFF-3), Claudin-3 (CLDN-3), γ-enteric smooth muscle actin (ACTG2), intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), interleukin-8 (IL-8), platelet-activating factor (PAF), and leptin (LP) were compared among calves grouped according to whether they were healthy (control group; G-1) or had diarrhea caused by K99 Escherichia coli (G-2; n = 10), bovine rota- or coronavirus (G-3; 5 each), or Cryptosporidium spp (G-4; 10). RESULTS Across the 3 time points at which blood samples were obtained and evaluated, the groups of calves with diarrhea generally had markedly higher mean serum concentrations of L-FABP, TFF-3, IAP, IL-8, and LP, compared with the control group. In addition, G-2 also consistently had markedly higher mean serum concentrations of I-FAB and ACTG2 and lower mean serum concentrations of CLDN-3, compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results indicated that degree of intestinal epithelial damage differed among calves grouped by the etiologic agent of diarrhea and that such damage might have been more severe in calves with diarrhea caused by K99 E coli. Additionally, our results indicated that serum concentrations of I-FABP, L-FABP, TFF-3, IAP, IL-8, ACTG2, LP, and CLDN-3 were useful biomarkers of intestinal epithelial damage in calves of the present study.","Ok, Mahmut; Yildiz, Ramazan; Hatipoglu, Fatih; Baspinar, Nuri; Ider, Merve; Üney, Kamil; Ertürk, Alper; Durgut, Murat K; Terzi, Funda",American journal of veterinary research,50,1

In the present study we aimed to evaluate the frequency of M. hominis DNA in prostate tissue of Iranian patients with prostate cancer (PCa) in comparison to a control group with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). METHODS This research was a retrospective case-control study using 61 archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks of prostate tissue from patients with PCa and 70 FFPE blocks of patients with BPH. Real-time PCR, targeting two different genes, 16S rRNA and yidC, in the M. hominis genome was performed for all specimens. RESULTS Out of 61 blocks of prostate biopsy from patients with PCa, eight samples (13%) were positive for M. hominis, while the bacterium was not detected in any of the 70 blocks of patients with BPH (P value, 0.002). CONCLUSIONS The high frequency of M. hominis in patients with PCa likely shows a hidden role of the organism in prostate cancer during its chronic, apparently silent and asymptomatic colonization in prostate.","Saadat, Saman; Karami, Pezhman; Jafari, Mohammad; Kholoujini, Mahdi; Tehrani, Zahra Rikhtegaran; Mohammadi, Younes; Alikhani, Mohammad Yousef",Pathogens and disease,50,5

BACKGROUND New Zealand's nursing workforce is becoming increasingly multicultural as foreign nurses make up an essential part of the New Zealand health workforce. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the contributions that nurses have made in providing frontline services to the public. However, little has been documented about challenges and experiences of this minority ethnic group - Chinese nurses - who have been working as registered nurses in New Zealand during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS This study utilised an anonymous online questionnaire and a thematic approach to establishing understandings of the experiences of New Zealand registered nurses of Chinese ethnicity in working through the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 51 Chinese nurses completed this survey. A self-explanatory checklist for reporting results of internet e-surveys (CHERRIES) was used for the purpose of the quality of this online survey. RESULTS The result showed that 47.06% participants (n=24) reported negative experiences including racial discrimination, workplace bullying and judgement, while 52.94% (n=27) participants reported positive working experiences including supports received in the workplace and positive recognition by the pubic in New Zealand. CONCLUSION Ethnic-minority nurses are key assets to the New Zealand health system. It is important to understand their experiences and challenges, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic to make sure they are supported and protected from any physical and emotional injury. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE COVID-19 has brought additional challenges and concerns to nurses who are working on the frontline of health services.

Children entered the cohort at the beginning of the RSV season, after a minimum of 60 days in ambulatory care, and were followed until the earliest of the following: season end, second birthday, loss of eligibility, hospitalization, or death. Study endpoint was the first RSV-related hospitalization. To evaluate the presence of confounding, a second endpoint, hospitalizations for pneumonia or bronchiolitis secondary to specified bacterial or viral pathogens other than RSV, was used. Palivizumab exposure defined as first use (day 1-30 of first dose), subsequent use (days 1-30 of each subsequent dose), and former use (days 31-60 after any dose if delays or no readministration occurred) was compared with non-use with a Cox regression model, adjusting for confounders. RESULTS Hazard ratios (HRs) for RSV hospitalizations were 0.89 (95%CI, 0.71-1.12), 0.56 (95%CI, 0.46-0.69), and 0.71 (95%CI, 0.51-0.97) for first, subsequent, and former use, respectively. HRs for hospitalization because of non-RSV infections were 1.31 (95%CI, 1.04-1.65), 1.03 (95%CI, 0.86-1.23), and 1.05 (95%CI, 0.78-1.41), indicating residual confounding for first but not for subsequent and former use. CONCLUSION In this community-based study, palivizumab was associated with a reduction in severe RSV infections of a magnitude comparable to the lower clinical trial efficacy estimates. Protection appears to extend beyond the currently recommended monthly dosing schedule.","Winterstein, Almut G; Hampp, Christian; Saidi, Arwa",Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,50,16

Answering this question has fundamental implications not only for understanding the political consequences of polarization, but also for understanding how citizens form preferences. Under most political circumstances, this is a difficult question to answer, but the novel coronavirus pandemic allows us to understand how partisan animus contributes to opinion formation. Using a two-wave panel that spans the outbreak of COVID-19, we find a strong association between citizens' levels of partisan animosity and their attitudes about the pandemic, as well as the actions they take in response to it. This relationship, however, is more muted in areas with severe outbreaks of the disease. Our results make clear that narrowing of issue divides requires not only policy discourse but also addressing affective partisan hostility.","Druckman, James N; Klar, Samara; Krupnikov, Yanna; Levendusky, Matthew; Ryan, John Barry",Nature human behaviour,50,10

Especially in cardiovascular diseases, ACE2, as a negative regulator of RAAS, is an extremely important protective factor that mainly plays a role by converting Ang Ⅱ to Ang-(1-7). Nevertheless, with the recent outbreak of COVID-19, it was exposed that another identity of ACE2 is the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which previously served as the entry receptor for SARS. With the in-depth clinical research, it was found that the severity and susceptibility of COVID-19 are related to cardiovascular disease, and SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 receptor is also potentially associated with heart injury symptoms. Therefore, in this article, we mainly review the relationship between ACE2, COVID-19 and cardiovascular system diseases/heart injury.","Li, Shuainan; Cai, Benzhi; Ma, Wenya; Yang, Fan; Xu, Yan; Xu, Binbin",Current drug targets,50,1

METHODS Retrospective review of our database to include all patients who were treated with a PED for recurrent or residual IAs following surgical clipping or coiling. We evaluated neurological outcome and angiograms at discharge, 6- and 12-months' follow-up and assessed intimal hyperplasia at follow-up. RESULTS Twenty-four patients met our inclusion criteria. Most IAs were located in the anterior circulation (n=21). No change of preprocedure modified Rankin Scale score was seen at discharge or at any scheduled follow-up. Complete or near-complete aneurysm occlusion on 6- and 12-month angiograms was seen in 94.4% (17/18 cases) and 93.3% (14/15 cases), respectively. Complete or near-complete occlusion was seen in 100% of previously ruptured and 85.7% (6/7 cases) and 83.3% (5/6 cases) of previously unruptured cases at the 6- and 12-months' follow-up, respectively. One case of moderate intimal hyperplasia was observed at 6 months and decreased to mild at the 12-months' follow-up.

Some studies have proposed that cannabidiol (CBD) decreases the motivation for METH seeking, but reports indicate that the therapeutic benefits are only for heroin. Here, we studied the interaction between CBD and METH during the sensitization phase on the rewarding effect of METH, using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm to measure possible alterations in sensitivity. Our data showed that i. p. injection of METH created METH-induced CPP at two of the highest applied doses (1 and 2 mg/kg), and injection of METH during the sensitization period caused an establishment of METH-induced CPP at lower doses (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg). Data also revealed that i. c.v. administration of CBD during the sensitization phase, shifted the establishment of METH-induced CPP toward a lower dose (0.5 mg/kg). Concurrent administration of CBD (10 μg/5 μl, i. c.v.) and METH (0.25 mg/kg, i. p.) during sensitization phase established METH-induced CPP with sub-threshold doses of METH (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/kg). Our results suggest the involvement of CBD and prior exposure to METH in creating sensitization to METH CPP.","Khanegheini, Arash; Khani, Masoumeh; Zarrabian, Shahram; Yousefzadeh-Chabok, Shahrokh; Taleghani, Behrooz Khakpour; Haghparast, Abbas",Journal of psychiatric research,50,24

We aimed to assess to what extent difference in FIV explains the effect of EVT on functional outcome in a randomised trial of EVT versus no EVT (MR CLEAN). METHODS FIV was assessed on non-contrast CT scan 5-7 days after stroke. Functional outcome was the score on the modified Rankin Scale at 3 months. We tested the causal pathway from intervention, via FIV to functional outcome with a mediation model, using linear and ordinal regression, adjusted for relevant baseline covariates, including stroke severity. Explained effect was assessed by taking the ratio of the log odds ratios of treatment with and without adjustment for FIV. RESULTS Of the 500 patients included in MR CLEAN, 60 died and four patients underwent hemicraniectomy before FIV was assessed, leaving 436 patients for analysis. Patients in the intervention group had better functional outcomes (adjusted common odds ratio (acOR) 2.30 (95% CI 1.62-3.26) than controls and smaller FIV (median 53 vs. 81 ml) (difference 28 ml; 95% CI 13-41). Smaller FIV was associated with better outcome (acOR per 10 ml 0.60, 95% CI 0.52-0.68). After adjustment for FIV the effect of intervention on functional outcome decreased but remained substantial (acOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.44-2.91). This implies that preventing FIV progression explains 14% (95% CI 0-34) of the beneficial effect of EVT on outcome. CONCLUSION The effect of EVT on FIV explains only part of the treatment effect on functional outcome. KEY POINTS • Endovascular treatment in acute ischaemic stroke patients prevents progression of follow-up infarct volume on non-contrast CT at 5-7 days. • Follow-up infarct volume was related to functional outcome, but only explained a modest part of the effect of intervention on functional outcome. • A large proportion of treatment effect on functional outcome remains unexplained, suggesting FIV alone cannot be used as an early surrogate imaging marker of functional outcome.","Compagne, K C J; Boers, A M M; Marquering, H A; Berkhemer, O A; Yoo, A J; Beenen, L F M; van Oostenbrugge, R J; van Zwam, W H; Roos, Y B W E M; Majoie, C B; van Es, A C G M; van der Lugt, A; Dippel, D W J; Lingsma, H",European radiology,50,1

However, few studies have investigated the role of diet-alone interventions in improving individuals' weight gain by taking AAPs. In closed management mental hospitals of China, family members are allowed to bring food to patients regularly, causing patients to have caloric intake added to their 3 daily meals. However, during the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), bringing food to the hospital was temporarily prohibited in mental health institutions in China to prevent the spread of the virus. This study sought to compare the body weight and body mass index (BMI) changes of patients taking olanzapine or clozapine undergoing diet-alone interventions caused by this prohibition. METHODS A retrospective self-controlled study was conducted on 90 patients with schizophrenia from a single-center treated with olanzapine or clozapine monotherapy, or combined with aripiprazole or ziprasidone which has a small metabolic impact. A paired-samples t-test was used to compare the changes in body weight and BMI before and after the 3-month prohibition, and general linear regression was used to analyze the effects of gender, age, disease course, duration of drug exposure, and equivalent dose on the BMI improvement. Also, the percentage of people who lost weight and that of individuals who lost 5% of their pre-prohibition body weight were calculated. RESULTS Paired-samples t-test showed that after 3-month prohibition, the patients' body weight (71.68±6.83 vs. 66.91±7.03, P<0.001) and BMI (26.43±2.11 vs. 24.63±1.81, P<0.001) decreased significantly. Weight loss rate accounted for 99.1%, and weight loss of 5% from the pre-prohibition body weight accounted for 71.8%. General linear regression showed that the duration of drug exposure (β =-0.678, P<0.001) was significantly and negatively correlated with the BMI changes. No significant correlation of gender, age, disease course, or equivalent dose with BMI changes was found. CONCLUSIONS Diet-alone interventions facilitate weight loss in chronically hospitalized schizophrenia patients taking AAPs. Conduction of dietary intervention in the early stages of medication may yield greater benefits.","Zhang, Chengfang; Wang, Xiaodan; Hu, Chengping; Ding, Wenhua; Li, Han; Wu, Meng; Hu, Manji; Wang, Qiang; Sun, Xirong",Annals of palliative medicine,50,16

For the first time, we aimed to determine the accuracies of white blood cell counts and inflammatory biomarkers for prognosis of COVID-19 patient's outcome by a DTA meta-analysis. Until August24, 2020, we searched Web of Sciences, Scopus, and MEDLINE/PubMed databases to achieve related papers. Summary points and lines of included studies were calculated from 2×2 tables by bivariate/hierarchical models. Critical condition and mortality were considered as outcomes. A total of 13387 patients from 28 studies were included in this study. Six biomarkers containing leukocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, increased level of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin (PCT), and ferritin met the inclusion criteria. Analysis of the area under the curve (AUCHSROC) indicated that the PCT was the only applicable prognostic biomarker for critical condition and mortality (AUCHSROC=0.80 for both conditions). Pooled-diagnostic odds ratios were 6.78 (95% CI, 3.65-12.61) for prognosis of critical condition and 13.21 (95% CI, 3.95-44.19) for mortality. Other biomarkers had insufficient accuracies for both conditions (AUCHSROC< 0.80). Among evaluated biomarkers, only PCT has good accuracy for the prognosis of both critical condition and mortality in COVID-19 and it can be considered as a single prognostic biomarker for poor outcomes. Also, PCT has more accuracy for the prognosis of mortality in comparison to critical condition.","Zare, Mohammad Erfan; Wang, Yanzhong; Nasir Kansestani, Atefeh; Almasi, Afshin; Zhang, Jun","Iranian journal of allergy, asthma, and immunology",50,5

These changes have rekindled debates about the validity and legitimacy of global health estimates. This paper draws on country case studies and personal experience to support our opinion that the production and use of estimates are deeply embedded in specific social, economic, political, and ideational contexts, which vary at different levels of the global health architecture. Broadly, most global health estimates tend to be made far from the localities where the data upon which they are based are collected and where the results of estimation processes must ultimately be used if they are to make a difference to the health of individuals. Internationally standardised indicators are necessary, but they are no substitute for data that meet local needs and that fit with local ideas of what is credible and useful - in other words, data that are both technically and socially robust for those who make key decisions about health. We suggest that greater engagement of local actors (and local data) in the formulation, communication, and interpretation of health estimates would increase the likelihood that these data will be used by those most able to translate them into health gains for the longer term. Besides strengthening national information systems, this requires ongoing interaction, building trust, and establishing a communicative infrastructure. Local capacities to use knowledge to improve health must be supported.","Pisani, Elizabeth; Kok, Maarten",Global health action,50,16

Although C. sativa is one of the most investigated medicinal plants in the world, it faces the most controversial of issues for its legalization as a medication. C. sativa contains several hundreds of phytoconstituents including the infamous «cannabinoid."" It is necessary to properly understand the medicinal importance of these phytochemicals and spread awareness among the countries where it's still facing legal complexities. The current review is focusing on most recent literature pertaining to the various applications of cannabinoids with a special focus on medicinal aspect of the phytochemicals. Peer reviewed articles focusing on the importance of cannabis and cannabinoids were the target of this review. Articles were selected based on the relevance to the general scope of the work i.e. application of cannabinoids. Cannabinoids can truly be regarded as wonder drug keeping their immense diversity of usage but unfortunately, many of the mares never researched biologically or pharmacologically due to their low yield in the plant. However, the approval of some cannabinoids by the FDA (along with other recognized national medical health systems) has opened the horizons for the explicit use of these natural drugs in medicines such as Epidiolex® (cannabidiol used for the treatment of severe forms of epilepsy) and Sativex®('Δ9 -tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol' used for the treatment of spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis, aka: MS.) Many pharmacological properties of C. sativa are attributed to cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive component, along with Δ9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9 -THC), a psychoactive component. This review addresses the most important application or current utilization of cannabinoids in a variety of treatments such as: chronic pain, cancer, emesis, anorexia, irritable bowel syndrome, communicative diseases, glaucoma and central nervous system disorders. The biosynthetic pathway of cannabinoids is also discussed. In short, this plant has a myriad of bioactive compounds which have the potential to increase the list of approved cannabinoids suitable for therapy.","Khalid, Shah; Almalki, Faisal A; Ben Hadda, Taibi; Bader, Ammar; Abu-Izneid, Tareq; Berredjem, Malika; Elsharkawy, Eman R; Alqahtani, Ali M",Current pharmaceutical design,50,10

Mammalian β-defensins are small peptides of about 4.5-6 kDa in mass and are effectors of the innate immune response with potent antimicrobial activity. In this paper, we focused on the anti-influenza A activity of the recombinant mouse β-defensin 3 (rMBD-3) in vivo and in vitro. METHODS The rMBD-3 peptide was added to Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells at different stages of influenza A virus (IAV) A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) infection and its virus inhibitory properties were determined. Mice were infected with IAV and treated with rMBD-3 peptide from 12 h post-infection. The effect of rMBD-3 peptide was determined by pulmonary viral load, pathology and mortality. In addition, the expression of interleukin (IL)-12, interferon (IFN)-γ and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α genes in mice with or without rMBD-3 treatment was determined by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. RESULTS rMBD-3 was shown to protect MDCK cells against IAV infection and had a major role in inhibition of adsorption and uptake by cells infected with IAV. Following the addition of 100 μg/ml rMBD-3 to MDCK cells medium, approximately 80% of cells were protected from infection in vitro. rMBD-3 given by tail vein injection (10 mg/kg/day) was the most effective method to improve the survival rate of the mice. Treatment with rMBD-3 was found to up-regulate IFN-γ and IL-12 gene expression, but reduced expression of the TNF-α gene. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate that rMBD-3 possesses anti-influenza virus activity both in vivo and in vitro that might be of therapeutic use.","Jiang, Yan; Yang, De; Li, Wanyi; Wang, Baoning; Jiang, Zhonghua; Li, Mingyuan",Antiviral chemistry & chemotherapy,50,16

Whether is necessary to explore treatment and prevention of VTE in lung cancer. BACKGROUND Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication of severe lung cancer that can entail many adverse effects for patients. The incidence of VTE is higher in patients with lung cancer than in those with other kinds of solid tumors, and it is especially high among patients with lung adenocarcinoma, at advanced tumor-node-metastasis (TNM)stages, or with a history of central venous catheter (CVC) or chemotherapy. However, the clinical symptoms of VTE in patients with lung cancer are not typical and cannot be detected easily, and the clinical prevention rate is low. In the acute phase of VTE in lung cancer, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of patients typically ranges from 2 to 4 points, leaving end-stage maintenance therapy as the only treatment option. METHODS Here, we analyze the existing literature and discuss the current status (including epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and risk factors), risk assessment tools, and the treatment and prevention of VTE in severe lung cancer. We focus particularly on the use of low-molecular-weight heparin and new oral anticoagulants (including in the management of thrombocytopenia after antitumor therapy) in lung cancer patients with VTE. CONCLUSIONS Large-scale prospective multicenter studies on the treatment and prevention of VTE in lung cancer are necessary.","Zheng, Lin-Xin; Li, Li; Huang, Jin-Hai; Mai, Yu-Mei; Chen, Can; Dong, Jia-Hui; Xu, Zhi-Yong; Li, Wei-Feng; Chen, Xiao-Rong",Annals of palliative medicine,50,1

This raises the question as to how psychosocial stress associated with the pandemic can be managed, and also if certain forms of stress can contribute to an increase in infections and critical illnesses. METHODS Against the background of the current state of research on stress and the immune response, we provide a narrative review of studies addressing the question as to how stress can influence the immune defence against viral diseases. RESULTS Excessive stress can compromise the barrier function of the airways and alter neuroendocrine control of immune function, which can create a virus-permissive immune response. DISCUSSION Because certain forms of stress can play a role in the successful immune defence against viral respiratory disease, it is important to identify people with high psychosocial stress and to help them manage their stress. Conclusion Psychosocial measures that contribute to improved stress management may have a positive effect on the immune response against viral respiratory infections.","Peters, Eva Milena Johanne; Schedlowski, Manfred; Watzl, Carsten; Gimsa, Ulrike","Psychotherapie, Psychosomatik, medizinische Psychologie",50,27

This article provides a contemporary overview of the safety and efficacy of different strategies for mechanical ventilation and adjunctive respiratory approaches in patients with acute brain injury. RECENT FINDINGS Available evidence indicates that lung-protective ventilation (LPV) can be implemented safely in a range of patients with concurrent respiratory failure and brain injury of different etiologies; however, the clinical efficacy of LPV in this setting needs to be established. In patients who have severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and brain injury, adjunctive measures (neuromuscular blocker drug infusions, prone positioning, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) may be considered, although the neurophysiological impact and safety of these techniques need further investigation. Intracranial pressure and other neuromonitoring techniques may be of value to ensure optimal management of mechanical ventilation and adjunctive measures in this population.

The purpose of this study was to examine the available literature on the impact of sensory interventions on the quality of life of residents living in long-term care settings. METHODS We conducted a mixed-methods scoping review using Arksey and O'Malley's framework. Seven databases (Medline (Ovid), PubMed (non-Medline-Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase (Ovid), Ageline, PsycINFO (Ovid), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials until 1 December 2020) were searched. Two reviewers independently screened the studies for sensory interventions using a two-step process. Eligible studies underwent data extraction and results were synthesised descriptively. RESULTS We screened 5551 titles and abstracts. A total of 52 articles met our inclusion criteria. Some interventions involved only one sense: hearing (n=3), sight (n=12), smell (n=4) and touch (n=15). Other interventions involved multiple senses (n=18). We grouped the interventions into 16 categories (music programmes, environmental white noise, bright light interventions, visual stimulations, olfactory stimulations, massages, therapeutic touch, tactile stimulations, physical activity plus night-time programmes, pet therapies, various stimuli interventions, Snoezelen rooms, motor and multisensory based strategies, Namaste care, environmental modifications and expressive touch activities). CONCLUSION This preliminary review summarised some of the available sensory interventions that will help inform a series of future systematic reviews on each of the specific interventions. The evidence-based knowledge for sensory interventions will also inform a future audit programme for assessing the presence of sensory interventions in long-term care.","Backman, Chantal; Demery-Varin, Melissa; Cho-Young, Danielle; Crick, Michelle; Squires, Janet",BMJ open,50,1

To date, the role of IL-17 in viral infections and type 1 diabetes is ambiguous. In this study, we used IL-17A enhanced green fluorescent protein bicistronic reporter mouse strains to analyze in situ production of IL-17A. Upon Klebsiella pneumoniae bacterial infection, CD4(+) and γδ T cells produce IL-17A. In contrast, CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells do not produce IL-17A in response to acute or protracted viral infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or during autoimmune diabetes development in the CD8-driven lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-induced model of type 1 diabetes.

Expression of CD56 has been studied in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) with controversial results. The scope of this study was to examine the expression of CD56 in MM patients at diagnosis and investigate its association with clinicopathologic parameters. We retrospectively collected and analyzed data from 109 patients with MM diagnosed over the last decade (January 2010 to June 2020). Expression of CD56 was assessed by immunohistochemistry in bone marrow biopsies and investigated its association with a variety of clinicopathological parameters. For the statistical analysis χ2 test and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare categorical and continuous variables in CD56+ and CD56- patients, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 21.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Based on the expression of CD56 the patient population was divided to CD56+ patients and CD56- patients; Sixty-eight patients were CD56 + and 41 patients were CD56-. Absence of CD56 expression was associated with unfavorable prognostic parameters such as elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and β2-microglobulin levels, advanced stage according to the International Staging System (ISS) and clonal bone marrow plasma cell infiltration ≥ 60%, but no effect on outcome, while the expression of CD56 was associated with well differentiated neoplastic plasma cells. Our study confirmed that lack of CD56 expression is a possible marker of poor prognosis in patients with MM. The detection of CD56 expression by either immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry is simple and cheap, and it could be incorporated in future prognostic or predictive scores. Prospective studies are needed in order to evaluate the role of expression of CD56 as a predictive biomarker in the era of novel regimens.","Koumpis, Epameinondas; Tassi, Iliana; Malea, Theodora; Papathanasiou, Konstantina; Papakonstantinou, Ioannis; Serpanou, Anastasia; Tsolas, Evangelos; Kapsali, Eleni; Vassilakopoulos, Theodoros P; Papoudou-Bai, Alexandra; Hatzimichael, Eleftheria","Pathology, research and practice",50,28

Past studies have shown that anesthesiologists are not formally trained in leading these discussions and may lack the necessary skill set. We created an innovative online video curriculum designed to teach these skills. This curriculum was compared to a traditional method of learning from reading the medical literature. METHODS In this bi-institutional randomized controlled trial at 2 major academic medical centers, 60 anesthesiology trainees were randomized to receive the educational content in 1 of 2 formats: (1) the novel video curriculum (video group) or (2) journal articles (reading group). Thirty residents were assigned to the experimental video curriculum group, and 30 were assigned to the reading group. The content incorporated into the 2 formats focused on general preoperative evaluation of patients and communication strategies pertaining to GOC and CS discussions. Residents in both groups underwent a pre- and postintervention objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) with standardized patients. Both OSCEs were scored using the same 24-point rubric. Score changes between the 2 OSCEs were examined using linear regression, and interrater reliability was assessed using weighted Cohen's kappa. RESULTS Residents receiving the video curriculum performed significantly better overall on the OSCE encounter, with a mean score of 4.19 compared to 3.79 in the reading group. The video curriculum group also demonstrated statistically significant increased scores on 8 of 24 rubric categories when compared to the reading group. CONCLUSIONS Our novel video curriculum led to significant increases in resident performance during simulated GOC discussions and modest increases during CS discussions. Further development and refinement of this curriculum are warranted.","Robertson, Amy C; Fowler, Leslie C; Kimball, Thomas S; Niconchuk, Jonathan A; Kreger, Michael T; Brovman, Ethan Y; Rickerson, Elizabeth; Sadovnikoff, Nicholas; Hepner, David L; McEvoy, Matthew D; Bader, Angela M; Urman, Richard D",Anesthesia and analgesia,50,31

Volume, pH, osmolarity, sperm concentration, motility, status, morphology and plasma membrane integrity were assessed for each ejaculate. Semen with the highest proportion of motile sperm was collected between April-June for both in situ and aquarium sand tiger sharks indicating a seasonal reproductive cycle. Overall, 17 of 30 semen samples collected from aquarium sharks from April through June contained motile sperm compared to 29 of 29 of in situ sharks, demonstrating semen quality differences between aquarium and in situ sharks. Sperm motility, status, morphology and plasma membrane integrity were significantly higher (P < 0.05) for in situ compared to aquarium sand tiger sharks. Testosterone was measured by an enzyme immunoassay validated for the species. Testosterone concentration was seasonal for both aquarium and in situ sharks with highest concentrations measured in spring and lowest in summer. In situ sharks had higher (P < 0.05) testosterone concentration in spring than aquarium sharks. This study demonstrated annual reproduction with spring seasonality for male sand tiger sharks through marked seasonal differences in testosterone and semen production. Lower testosterone and poorer semen quality was observed in aquarium sharks likely contributing to the species' limited reproductive success in aquariums.","Wyffels, Jennifer T; George, Robert; Adams, Lance; Adams, Cayman; Clauss, Tonya; Newton, Alisa; Hyatt, Michael W; Yach, Christopher; Penfold, Linda M",Biology of reproduction,50,5

When caring for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, the RKI recommends wearing particle-filtering half masks with a filter performance of at least 94 %, which corresponds to FFP class 2 according to EN 149:2001+A1:2009. We have examined 15 particle-filtering half masks with different specifications for their filter performance METHOD: The masks were clamped in a jig in an airtight test box. Radioactive particles with a size of 0.6 ± 0.4 µm were nebulized into the box and sucked into a filter through the port of the jig and an unfiltered reference port using an artificial lung. The activity deposited on the filter was measured by means of a gamma camera. The filter performance was calculated from this. RESULTS Five of the 15 masks tested had a filter performance of less than 94 % and therefore do not meet the FFP2 standard. The filter performance of these masks was 71.8 ± 2.3 %, 73.2 ± 2.3 %, 78.2 ± 6.7 %, 92.2 ± 0.5 % and 85.9 ± 1.6 %.

MiR-26a was reported to be highly expressed in ADSCs under induction and Forkhead box C2 (FOXC2), as a key substrate of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) could inhibit white adipocyte differentiation, which was mediated by miR-26a. However, the relationship between miR-26a and CDK5/FOXC2 during ADSCs differentiation remains unknown. We want to verify the regulated mechanism of miR-26a/CDK5/FOXC2 axis participating in the adipogenic differentiation of ADSCS. METHODS ADSCs were isolated and verified by flow cytometry. Oil Red O staining was performed to assess the capacity for adipogenic differentiation of ADSCs. The proliferation ability of ADSCs was verified by MTT assay. The expression of miR-26a, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors γ (PPARγ), CDK5, and FOXC2 were tested by qRT-PCR and Western blot, and the relationship between miR-26a and CDK5 was verified by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. RESULTS MiR-26a and PPARγ were upregulated and CDK5 and FOXC2 were downregulated during adipogenic differentiation of ADSCs. Knockdown of miR-26a or overexpression of CDK5 could inhibit adipogenic differentiation of ADSCs induced by insulin. MiR-26a could directly target CDK5 and the effect of miR-26a inhibitor on adipogenic differentiation of ADSCs could be blocked by si-CDK5. CONCLUSION We demonstrated that miR-26a regulated insulin-induced adipogenic differentiation of ADSCs by regulating CDK5/FOXC2 pathway, which could provide the key to a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of obesity and type 2 diabetes.","Zhang, Xu-Xiang; Wang, Yu-Ming; Su, Yan-Dan; Zuo, Fan; Wu, Bin; Nian, Xin",Molecular and cellular biochemistry,50,5

Emerging adults are clinically challenging in terms of harmful cannabis use due to perceptions of high rates of peer use, social acceptance, and low risk of harm. Brief interventions to increase awareness and promote motivation to change are therefore particularly important for this age group. There is existing evidence on the effectiveness of brief interventions for alcohol in emerging adults, but it is not clear if comparable evidence is present for cannabis. The objective of this systematic review is to summarize and critically appraise the existing literature of brief interventions for cannabis use both narratively, to describe the content and delivery of existing interventions, and meta-analytically, to determine the aggregated efficacy of these interventions on cannabis use and other outcomes (e.g., other substance use, mental health, help-seeking behaviors, and academic and occupational outcomes).

To enhance the research availability of relevant clinical specimens, we developed the Living BioBank (LBB) solution, which allows for just-in-time capture and delivery of phenotyped surplus laboratory medicine specimens. The LBB is a system-of-systems integrating research feasibility databases in i2b2, a real time clinical data warehouse, and an informatics system for institutional research services management (SPARC). LBB delivers de-identified clinical data and laboratory specimens. We further present an extension to our solution, the Living {micro}Biome Bank, that allows the user to request and receive phenotyped specimen microbiome data. We discuss the details of the implementation of the LBB system and the necessary regulatory oversight for this solution. The conducted institutional focus group of translational investigators indicates an overall positive sentiment towards potential scientific results generated with the use of LBB.

This is likely caused by a hot blob of plasma ejected from Betelgeuse and then cooled to obscuring dust. If true, it is a remarkable opportunity to directly witness the formation of dust around a red supergiant star. Today's optical telescope facilities are not optimized for time-evolution monitoring of the Betelgeuse surface, so in this work, we propose a low-cost optical interferometer. The facility will consist of $12 \times 4$ inch optical telescopes mounted on the surface of a large radio dish for interferometric imaging; polarization-maintaining single-mode fibers will carry the coherent beams from the individual optical telescopes to an all-in-one beam combiner. A fast steering mirror assisted fiber injection system guides the flux into fibers. A metrology system senses vibration-induced piston errors in optical fibers, and these errors are corrected using fast-steering delay lines. We will present the design.","Anugu, Narsireddy; Morzinski, Katie M.; Eisner, Josh; Douglas, Ewan; Marrone, Dan; Ertel, Steve; Haffert, Sebastiaan; Montoya, Oscar; Stone, Jordan; Kraus, Stefan; Monnier, John; Lebouquin, Jean-Baptiste; Berger, Jean-Philippe; Woillez, Julien; Montarges, Miguel",,50,20

Diverse restrictive policies have been enforced to prevent the novel Coronavirus from spreading. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the express logistics companies transport essential goods among different regions in China, supporting people's normal lives. This study explores the dynamic impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on the intra-provincial and inter-provincial express parcel flows based on the statistical and econometric analysis considering the individual-specific effects of each province. The key results obtained from the unique long-run panel data analysis are: (1) the temporal fluctuation of inter-provincial express logistics flows affected by the epidemic is stronger than that of intra-provincial flows, both of which also show significant spatial heterogeneity;(2) the process of China's fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic is divided into four stages according to the severity of pandemic and implications of restrictive policies, which have moderating effects for the impacts on the express logistics;(3) the dynamic effects of the pandemic on the express logistics are obviously heterogeneous in different stages, confirming the effectiveness of restrictive and support policies;(4) the delayed effects of COVID-19 epidemic on the regional express logistics vary with different setting of time lags. In the short term, the typical restrictive policies and Chinese Spring Festival holidays have significant negative effects on the express logistics. In the long term, the resumption of work and production stimulate the demands of express logistics, presenting significant positive effects in post-epidemic era. This study can provide the policy implications for the logistics planning and management under the public health intervention. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Yang, S.; Ning, L.; Jiang, T.; He, Y.",Transport Policy,50,1

The study aimed to deal with the major issues about tribal students’ online education by bringing out the key restraints of their distance learning and the possible solutions. The researchers followed a mixed method using a 5-point Likert Scale to point out the learner sensitivities, an online Focus Group Discussion (FGD) to know specific information from all the tribes who participated in the study. Additionally, four different questions were also set for multiple response analyses. The results suggested that the tribal students have not agreeably received adequate facilities such as technological support, university funding, departmental encouragements, or monetary benefits from the quota system in the current pandemic (COVID-19) time to attend virtual learning sessions though they expect arrangements and future steps for academic learning. All institutions also could not provide them adequate opportunities to attend online classes. In conclusion, the study proposed some imperative measures for example, inclusion of flipped classroom, introducing blended learning henceforth, revising quota facilities, adequate electricity support and internet connection, to help the tribal students as they should not get deprived. © 2021, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Objectives: The purpose of this study is to analyze the factors that can influence the anxiety of nurses in playing the role of caregiver during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study with a population of all nurses who met the inclusion criteria as much as 105 nurses. The research sample was selected through stratified random sampling and obtained 84 nurses. This research was conducted at RSI Jemursari Surabaya from June until September 2020. The research instruments used in this study were the demographic observation sheet, knowledge questionnaire, and the Hamilton Anxiety Rank Scale (HARS). Data analysis used Pearson chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression. Results: The results of the Pearson Chi-square test showed that of all the factors studied, only age (p = 0.004), availability of personal protective equipment (p = 0.002), and knowledge (p = 0.017) influenced nurses' anxiety. The results of the analysis using multivariate logistic regression test showed that the factor that most influenced nurses' anxiety was the availability of personal protective equipment (p = 0.001;OR = -3.062). Conclusion: Younger nurses, inadequate personal protective equipment, and less knowledgeable nurses were at high risk for more severe anxiety. Regular observation of the psychological condition of nurses and the fulfillment of the need for personal protective equipment is needed to prevent increased anxiety in nurses.","Septianingrum, Yurike; Fitriasari, Andikawati; Wardani, Erika Martining; en,",Nurse And Health: Jurnal Keperawatan,50,20

During CPR, both healthcare and non-healthcare workers who provide resuscitation are at risk of infection. The Working Group for Expert Consensus on Prevention and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Cardiac Arrest in COVID-19 has developed this Chinese Expert Consensus to guide clinical practice of CPR in COVID-19 patients. Main recommendations: (1) A medical team should be assigned to evaluate severe and critical COVID-19 for early monitoring of cardiac-arrest warning signs. (2) Psychological counseling and treatment are highly recommended, since sympathetic and vagal abnormalities induced by psychological stress from the COVID-19 pandemic can induce cardiac arrest. (3) Healthcare workers should wear personal protective equipment (PPE). (4) Mouth-to-mouth ventilation should be avoided on patients suspected of having or diagnosed with COVID-19. (5) Hands-only chest compression and mechanical chest compression are recommended. (6) Tracheal-intubation procedures should be optimized and tracheal-intubation strategies should be implemented early. (7) CPR should be provided for 20-30 min. (8) Various factors should be taken into consideration such as the interests of patients and family members, ethics, transmission risks, and laws and regulations governing infectious disease control. Changes in management: The following changes or modifications to CPR strategy in COVID-19 patients are proposed: (1) Healthcare workers should wear PPE. (2) Hands-only chest compression and mechanical chest compression can be implemented to reduce or avoid the spread of viruses by aerosols. (3) Both the benefits to patients and the risk of infection should be considered. (4) Hhealthcare workers should be fully aware of and trained in CPR strategies and procedures specifically for patients with COVID-19.","Song, Wei Wei Jie Jian XiangDong Wang DeRen Ouyang YanHong Liu YuanShui Du XianJin Chen Ying Zhang YingQi Xu HePing Xianyu ShuMing Ning Qiong Li Xiang Han XiaoTong Zhan Feng Yu Tao Chen WenTeng Zhang Jun Cai WenWei Zhou Sheng039; ang, Yi ShengYang Cao Yu Chen XiaoBei Xu ShunJiang Liang Zong039; an, Wu DuoHu Ai Fen Wang Zhong Meng QingYi Mi YuHong Zhang SiSen Yang RongJia Yan ShouChun Han WenBin Lin Yong Qian ChuanYun Zhang WenWu Xiong Yan Lv Jun Liu BaoChi Cao Yan He XiaoJun Sun XueLian Cao YuFang Zhou Tian039; en,",Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Medicine,50,1

168813,168813,168813,The Evolution of Immune Sensitivity under Immunopathological and Autoimmune Costs,11.275067,6.6794004,2020-10-16,"Background: Ibrutinib (ibr) is a once-daily Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor approved in the US for patients (pts) with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received ≥1 prior therapy. Venetoclax (ven) is a BCL-2 inhibitor approved for pts with CLL or previously untreated AML. Ibr + ven have shown synergistic antitumor activity in preclinical models and complementary clinical activity in early phase studies (Zhao Br J Haematol 2015;Tam NEJM 2018;Jain NEJM 2019). The ongoing phase 3 SYMPATICO study (PCYC-1143-CA, NCT03112174) evaluates the safety and efficacy of ibr + ven in pts with relapsed/refractory (R/R) MCL. A safety run-in (SRI) was conducted to inform whether a 1-month (mo) ibr lead-in would be implemented for the randomized portion of the study;initial data from the SRI evaluating tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) events and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) concluded that the study would proceed with concurrent ibr + ven, with no ibr lead-in (Wang ICML 2019). Updated safety and efficacy from the SRI are presented. Methods: The phase 3 SYMPATICO study is comprised of an open-label SRI and a double-blind randomized period. Key eligibility criteria were pathologically confirmed MCL with measurable disease, 1-5 prior therapies, and no prior treatment with BTK or BCL inhibitors. In the SRI, pts received oral, once-daily 560 mg ibr + ven in a 5-week ramp-up to 400 mg ven. Ibr + ven are dosed concurrently for 2 years;thereafter, ven is discontinued in all pts and ibr is continued until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint of the SRI was occurrence of TLS events and DLTs. Secondary endpoints included complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) per the 2014 Lugano criteria, progression-free survival (PFS), and duration of response (DOR). Rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD) were assessed in bone marrow and peripheral blood. Efficacy and safety were analyzed by TLS risk (low or high). TP53 mutational status was determined by next-generation sequencing. Results: Twenty-one pts were enrolled in the SRI, with a median time on study of 22 (range, 2-31) mo. The median age was 68 (range, 53-84) years, and the median number of prior therapies was 2 (range, 1-4);6 pts were considered at low risk for TLS and 15 pts were considered at high risk for TLS. All pts had at least 1 lesion >2 cm at baseline;11/21 (52%) had baseline detectable MRD in peripheral blood or bone marrow. Of the 11 pts with available TP53 mutation data, 4 (36%) had mutated TP53. Median time on treatment was 18 (range, <1-28) mo. During the 5-week ven ramp-up, 3 pts had DLTs, and 1 pt at high risk for TLS had a laboratory TLS (Wang ICML 2019);no additional TLS events occurred during follow-up. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were diarrhea (n=16 [76%]) and fatigue (n=11 [52%]). Grade 3/4 TEAEs occurred in 17 pts (81%). Four pts (19%) discontinued study drugs because of TEAEs. Two treatment-emergent deaths occurred: 1 from a retroperitoneal hemorrhage unrelated to ibr or ven that was related to disease progression and 1 from COVID-19 in a pt with CR. The overall response rate (ORR) was 81% (17/21) in all pts, with an ORR of 83% (5/6) in the cohort at low risk for TLS and 80% (12/15) in the cohort at high risk for TLS (Figure). Sixty-two percent (13/21) of pts had CR (low risk for TLS, 67% [4/6];high risk for TLS, 60% [9/15]), 19% (4/21) of pts had PR (low risk for TLS, 17% [1/6];high risk for TLS, 20% [3/15]);5% (1/21) of all pts had stable disease, and 10% (2/21) had PD;1 pt was unevaluable. The median DOR has not been reached (95% CI, 17.5 mo-NE). The median PFS per investigator assessment was not reached (95% CI, 13.7 mo-NE);estimated PFS at 18 mo was 75% (95% CI: 50%-89%) (Figure). All 11 pts with detectable MRD at baseline achieved undetectable MRD, including 7 pts who achieved CRs. Conclusions: Ibr + ven is an all-oral, once-daily, chemotherapy-free regimen being studied for treatment of pts with R/R MCL. With a median of 22 mo on study, no new safety signals we e observed;TLS events and DLTs were rare. Ibr + ven had sustained efficacy, with an ORR of 81%, CR rate of 62%, and the median PFS not reached. All MRD-assessable pts achieved undetectable MRD. The ongoing randomized portion of the SYMPATICO study is evaluating the efficacy and safety of ibr + ven compared with ibr + placebo in pts with R/R MCL;additionally, a single-arm, open-label cohort in previously untreated pts, including pts with TP53 mutations, is ongoing.

The feasibility of TNR in India has not been formally assessed so far. Methods: We conducted a single-center, prospective cohort study at a tertiary center in India. Persons with PD with Hoehn & Yahr (H & Y) stages 1-2.5, who were not enrolled into any formal exercise program, were offered TNR as per a predesigned program for 12 weeks. Baseline and post-intervention assessment included Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), part II and III, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ)-8 and Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS). We assessed adherence to TNR and problems expressed by patients/caregivers by means of open-ended surveys addressing barriers to rehabilitation. Results: We recruited 22 for TNR. Median age (interquartile range [IQR]) was 66.0 (44.0-71.0) years;66.7% were H & Y stage 2.0. One patient died of COVID-19-related complications. Of the remaining 21, 14 (66.7%) had adherence of ≥75%;16/21 (76.2%) patients had problems with attending TNR sessions as the family shared a single phone. Slow Internet speed was an issue among 13/21 (61.9%) of the patients. Other issues included lack of rapport, migration to distant hometowns and motor-hand impairment. Conclusion: Multiple challenges were faced in implementing a telerehabilitation program among persons with PD, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. These barriers were present at various levels: recruitment, adherence issues and maintenance. Future TNR programs must address these concerns.","Garg, Divyani Majumdar Ritu Chauhan Sonal Preenja Ravi Parihar Jasmine Saluja Alvee Dhamija Rajinder",Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology,50,29

Changing climatic patterns are manifested through occurrences like abrupt temperature increase, dwindling rainfall pattern, rise in spells of drought and flood. These conditions exert different effects across the geographical landscape of the country, which can broadly be classed as Semiarid, Sahel and Derived Savannah, respectively as well as Forest and Montane. Livestock provide humans with the full complement of amino acids, which are the only known natural suppliers of Vitamin B12 and equally supply iron, calcium, iodine and zinc. In addition, livestock accounts for 40% of Agricultural Gross Domestic Product and significantly contributes to enhancing rural livelihood. Stress conditions are induced in livestock by harsh weather conditions that reduce the feed available to them as well as impede growth rate and reproduction efficiency and disease incidence which may eventually result in death. In the light of the livestock benefits to humanity, it is necessary to devise means of making their climate resilient. Some of the proven strategies include animal genetic improvement for stress tolerance, growing disease resistant, early maturing and drought tolerant crops, selecting for and rearing climate tolerant animal species and breeds.","Oyeniyi, F.

We develop a likelihood-free, simulation-based approach, which combines deep learning with (1) a large set of summary statistics measured on phylogenies or (2) a complete and compact vectorial representation of trees, which avoids potential limitations of summary statistics and applies to any phylodynamic model. Our method enables both model selection and estimation of epidemiological parameters. We demonstrate its speed and accuracy on simulated data, where it performs better than the state-of-the-art methods.

However, specific information about COVID-19 outcomes in SLE is scarce. Objectives: To determine the characteristics associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes in a multi-national cross-sectional registry of COVID-19 patients with SLE. Methods: SLE adult patients from a physician-reported registry of the COVID-19 GRA were studied. Variables collected at COVID-19 diagnosis included age, sex, race/ethnicity, region, comorbidities, disease activity, time period of COVID-19 diagnosis, glucocorticoid (GC) dose, and immunomodulatory therapy. Immunomodulatory therapy was categorized as: antimalarials only, no SLE therapy, traditional immunosuppressive (IS) drug monotherapy, biologics/targeted synthetic IS drug monotherapy, and biologic and traditional IS drug combination therapy. We used an ordinal COVID-19 severity outcome defined as: not hospitalized/hospitalized without supplementary oxygen;hospitalized with non-invasive ventilation;hospitalized with mechanical ventilation/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation;and death. An ordinal logistic regression model was constructed to assess the association between demographic characteristics, comorbidities, medications, disease activity and COVID-19 severity. This assumed that the relationship between each pair of outcome groups is of the same direction and magnitude. Results: Of 1069 SLE patients included, 1047 (89.6%) were female, with a mean age of 44.5 (SD: 14.1) years. Patient outcomes included 815 (78.8%) not hospitalized/hospitalized without supplementary oxygen;116 (11.2) hospitalized with non-invasive ventilation, 25 (2.4%) hospitalized with mechanical ventilation/ extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and 78 (7.5%) died. In a multivariate model (n=804), increased age [OR=1.03 (1.01, 1.04)], male sex [OR =1.93 (1.21, 3.08)], COVID-19 diagnosis between June 2020 and January 2021 (OR =1.87 (1.17, 3.00)), no IS drug use [OR =2.29 (1.34, 3.91)], chronic renal disease [OR =2.34 (1.48, 3.70)], cardiovascular disease [OR =1.93 (1.34, 3.91)] and moderate/ high disease activity [OR =2.24 (1.46, 3.43)] were associated with more severe COVID-19 outcomes. Compared with no use of GC, patients using GC had a higher odds of poor outcome: 0-5 mg/d, OR =1.98 (1.33, 2.96);5-10 mg/d, OR =2.88 (1.27, 6.56);>10 mg/d, OR =2.01 (1.26, 3.21) (Table 1). Conclusion: Increased age, male sex, glucocorticoid use, chronic renal disease, cardiovascular disease and moderate/high disease activity at time of COVID-19 diagnosis were associated with more severe COVID-19 outcomes in SLE. Potential limitations include possible selection bias (physician reporting), the cross-sectional nature of the data, and the assumptions underlying the outcomes modelling.","Ugarte-Gil, M.

Various measures were applied to develop the models of human mobility and contact in a long range or a short range, such as Brown movement, random walks, spatial networks, gravity models, contact networks. We proposed a method of representing human daily movement and social contact by using multi-layer networks with temporal edge weights. We combined bipartite networks with social networks to describe human daily trip and social contact, respectively. Temporal edge weights of multi-layer networks were employed to denote the propensity of individual movement and contact. We also verified our models and parameters by incorporating human daily travel and contact regularities, as well as comparing experimental results with human behavior statistical laws. At last, we applied a Chinese university campus as a case study to investigate students' daily travel and social contact, and studied the transmission and control strategies of COVID-19 virus. We found stricter control strategies are needed to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19 virus in a university. Once a patient case emerges in a university, it is better to close the campus and quarantine all students. Partial control strategies such as quarantining a part of students and buildings cannot achieve a great effect of mitigating the transmission of COVID-19 virus.

Within this matrix of interdependent relations, schools operate under increasingly hybrid accountability arrangements in which public accountability can both complement and compete with market and social regimes and their associated institutional logics, goals, values and mechanisms. During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, national governments implemented a wide range of emergency measures which had consequences for the mixes and layers of school accountabilities. This article examines the principal policy changes in Denmark, England and Italy. Drawing on state theories and the concept of ‘hybrid accountability’, semi-structured interviews with national and local policymakers and school practitioners were analysed thematically. While cultural nuances exist between the cases, our findings reveal that state interventions reinforce a public–professional accountability hybrid and hierarchies of control and command within and outside networks. Concomitantly, state non-interventions and the distinct underlying institutional logics associated with national large-scale assessments suggest policy inertia with implications for professional accountability and institutionalised change. Future research might investigate whether educators’ experiences influence the direction of national and local accountability policy reforms in a post-pandemic era. © The Author(s) 2021.","Milner, A.

Recombination produces RNA populations distinct from full-length gene segments and can influence viral population dynamics, persistence, and host immune responses. Viruses in the Reoviridae family, including rotavirus and mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus), have been reported to package segments containing rearrangements or internal deletions. Rotaviruses with RNA segments containing rearrangements have been isolated from immunocompromised and immunocompetent children and in vitro following serial passage at high multiplicity. Reoviruses that package small, defective RNA segments have established chronic infections in cells and in mice. However, the mechanism and extent of Reoviridae RNA recombination are undefined. Towards filling this gap in knowledge, we determined the titers and RNA segment profiles for reovirus and rotavirus following serial passage in cultured cells. The viruses exhibited occasional titer reductions characteristic of interference. Reovirus strains frequently accumulated segments that retained 5′ and 3′ terminal sequences and featured large internal deletions, while similar segments were rarely detected in rotavirus populations. Using next-generation RNA-sequencing to analyze RNA molecules packaged in purified reovirus particles, we identified distinct recombination sites within individual viral gene segments. Recombination junction sites were frequently associated with short regions of identical sequence. Taken together, these findings suggest that reovirus accumulates defective gene segments featuring internal deletions during passage and undergoes sequence-directed recombination at distinct sites. IMPORTANCE Viruses in the Reoviridae family include important pathogens of humans and other animals and have segmented RNA genomes. Recombination in RNA virus populations can facilitate novel host exploration and increased disease severity. The extent, patterns, and mechanisms of Reoviridae recombination and the functions and effects of recombined RNA products are poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that mammalian orthoreovirus regularly synthesizes RNA recombination products that retain terminal sequences but contain internal deletions, while rotavirus rarely synthesizes such products. Recombination occurs more frequently at specific sites in the mammalian orthoreovirus genome, and short regions of identical sequence are often detected at junction sites. These findings suggest that mammalian orthoreovirus recombination events are directed in part by RNA sequences. An improved understanding of recombined viral RNA synthesis may enhance our capacity to engineer improved vaccines and virotherapies in the future.","Smith, Sydni Caet; Gribble, Jennifer; Diller, Julia R.; Wiebe, Michelle A.; Thoner, Timothy W.; Denison, Mark R.; Ogden, Kristen M.",bioRxiv,50,1

Design: Retrospective cohort study Setting: A large, integrated health system in central North Carolina. Participants: Children 5 to 17 years of age with a Durham County address and at least one health care encounter in the Duke University Health System between March 1, 2017, and February 28, 2020. Exposure: Diagnosis of asthma Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection identified by PCR testing of a respiratory sample collected between March 1, 2020, and October 31, 2020. We matched children with asthma 1:1 to children without asthma using propensity scores and used Poisson regression to evaluate the association between asthma and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We assessed for effect modification of this association by inhaled corticosteroid prescription and comorbid atopic diseases. Results: Of 49,455 children, 6,515 (13%) met criteria for a diagnosis of asthma; all children with asthma were matched to a control child without asthma for a final cohort of 13,030 children. Median (interquartile range) age was 11.0 (8.0, 14.0) years, 56% were male, and 78% were non-White. A diagnosis of asthma was associated with a decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection [risk ratio (RR): 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.49-0.92]. This association tended to be stronger in children with asthma who were prescribed inhaled corticosteroids (RR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.38-0.94) or who had comorbid atopic diseases (RR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.39-0.88).

In Japan, prefectures aggregate and announce the number of daily confirmed cases. We analyzed the impact of this effect in each prefecture. The effect is mainly found in prefectures with populations of 2 million or more. This effect is also constantly observed in the three major metropolitan areas in Japan. However, the magnitude of the observed effect is uncorrelated with both the number of positives per 1,000 people and the population size. Our results suggest that the reporting delay occurs in prefectures above a specific size, but the magnitude of the delay differs among prefectures. We consider two possible explanations for this effect: 1) delays caused by the administrative system. 2) fewer tests are conducted on the previous day.

The virus usually transmits via droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Since there is no vaccine to prevent the disease, social distancing and proper quarantine of infected persons are needed. To include and quantify the spatial effect of the pandemic regarding the geotemporal development of 2019-nCoV, a mathematical model of partial differential equations is essential. In this chapter a diffusion model has been developed by dividing the total population of constant size into four classes: susceptible population, infected population, quarantined population and recovered population. Here the disease transmission factor for both infected and quarantined population into the susceptible population are in more general form. Looking for a travelling wave solution this model can give the wave speed at which the disease 2019-nCoV spread. Additionally it can be predicted whether the total population in forward time will become susceptible or not in the absence of vaccine. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Mondal, H.

How do the international efforts of the United States and China on COVID-19 affect their respective soft power? How does the global public perception of the United States' and China's COVID-19 efforts affect their competitive advantage for global leadership? Based on the theory of soft power, I use Europe and Africa as cases with global perception data from the Pew Research Center (2017–2020) to argue that China would likely win some admiration for its COVID-19 efforts. However, it is unlikely to substantially shape positive global public perception of China to gain a competitive edge over the United States. This argument is based on the narrative China presents in the pandemic, its diplomatic style, and the ideational attachment the U.S. style has established. I utilize a phenomenological approach with narrative analysis.

In Austria, after a lockdown was decreed on 16 March 2020, educational institutions had to switch to a patched-up distance learning approach, which has been largely maintained to date. This article delivers empirical insights from an interdisciplinary mixed-methods research study that investigated university students’ perceptions of and experiences with distance learning as well as their educational (home) spaces during the pandemic in Innsbruck, Austria. It combines results from a quantitative survey conducted with 2742 students in early 2021 with a qualitative multi-method and longitudinal research study that accompanied 98 students throughout four data-collection phases in 2020. Results show a significant improvement since spring 2020 with both teachers and learners adjusting to the distance learning formats and the use of digital tools, yet students urgently desired a return to face-to-face teaching and university life, particularly for its social benefits. Strikingly, more than half of the participants wanted to maintain the option of overall distance education after the pandemic. Based on the perspectives of students, it is appropriate to demand significant changes in post-pandemic education adapted to the era of the post-digital, for which this article gives short-term as well as medium-term recommendations.","Bork-Hüffer, Tabea Kulcar Vanessa Brielmair Ferdinand Markl Andrea Immer Daniel Marian Juen Barbara Walter Maria Hildegard Kaufmann Katja",Sustainability,50,1

According to the Dementia Statistics Hub, only about 66% of all UK residents with dementia were diagnosed in 2017-2018. Yet, there are reservations about the early diagnosis of dementia-related diseases. As a result, the UK National Screening Committee does not recommend systematic population screening of dementia. Methods: This study added additional evidence of the effectiveness of the National Dementia Strategy and increased numbers of diagnosis of dementia on the younger cohorts of the elderly, using the intrinsic estimator age-period-cohort models and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing data. Results: Age effects show that screening and diagnosis increases in volume only among those aged 75 and above, suggesting that many of the younger elderly were not diagnosed. Period effects show that although there was an initial increase due to new policy implementation, the trend stalled in later years, indicating that the increase might not have been even across the period when controlled for age and cohort. The study also shows that cohort effects indicate lower prevalence in younger cohorts controlled for age and period. Conclusions: Although more research in diverse contexts is warranted, this study cautions against the abandonment of timely diagnosis and increased screening and shows some effectiveness of prevention strategies on the national level.","Kolpashnikova, K.",,50,1

To date, few studies have been conducted on the impacts of tourism development on the coastal communities in Thailand. This study assessed these impacts through the analysis of local perceptions based on four criteria of tourism development—the economic, environmental, social, and cultural impacts—using a five-point Likert scale. A survey of 116 households (HHs) was conducted at Cha-am Beach in the Gulf of Thailand. We found that the impacts of tourism development on coastal communities were 3.13 ± 1.02 (± refers to standard deviation) for social impact and 2.85 ± 1.03 for economic impact, indicating that tourism development had neutral and positive impacts. However, impacts on the other two criteria were below the average scores, indicating that tourism development had a negative impact on the local environment (2.50 ± 1.05) and local culture (2.41 ± 0.95). For overall impacts, the average score was 2.72 ± 1.02, indicating the coastal communities accepted tourism development in their communities. Nevertheless, as the overall score of tourism development was still far below the maximum point of 5, more efforts by the government as well as the private sector are needed to protect the local culture and coastal communities while improving the positive impacts on economic development and social integrity.","Unhasuta, Sussaangana Sasaki Nophea Kim Sohee Minsun",Sustainability,50,16

However, the policy discourse about digital technology has been for the most part strikingly narrow. Even as there is a discussion of the impact of particular digital tools, there is relatively little deliberation on the broader issues of how these technologies are reconstituting core aspects of health systems and polities. How did we get to a narrow debate on a vast topic? One way to understand this irony is by turning to the history of an older technology, namely agricultural biotechnology. This article focuses on two dominant framings that significantly narrowed the debates on agricultural biotechnology: first, a narrative that had a relentless focus on agricultural biotechnology as a neatly delineated field that produced stable products, and second, the ascent of a language of ethics that elided structural explanations and addressed only downstream impacts. The brief foray into the early years of agricultural biotechnology is useful in understanding contemporary politics of digital technology.","Mahajan, Manjari",Global Policy,50,22

It is not surprising that the platform has become an effervescent channel where people are talking about the COVID-19 pandemic. After one year of a severe pandemic, we are now giving the first steps towards its ending: the production and distribution of vaccines as well as the start of vaccination campaigns in several countries worldwide. However, the relatively quick emergence of alternative vaccines raised several concerns and doubts among the general people, leading to lively online and offline debates. In this paper, we investigate the public perception of this topic as it unrolls in the real world, analyzing over 12 million tweets during two months corresponding to the early stages of vaccination in the world. Our investigation includes the analyses of user engagement as well as content properties, including sentiment and psycholinguistic characteristics. In broad terms, our findings offer a first look into the dynamics of the online debate around a topic - COVID-19 vaccination - at its early stages of development, evidencing how people use the online world, notably Twitter, to share their impressions and concerns about it.

To this end, in April/May 2020, the managers of 35 RNPOs located in Poland were queried. The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρS), the coefficient of determination (R2) and a transformation coefficient (d) were primarily used to verify the hypotheses and interpret the relationships studied. The study revealed four OR descriptive levels—progressive (PR), sustainable (SR), regressive (RR), and downward (DR). The findings also show that the undertaken activities are related to the OR descriptive levels. RNPOs realised one of two adaptations: passive adaptation aimed at returning to the pre-pandemic original state with no changes may lead to a bounce backwards and an uncertain survival, whilst active adaptation leads to a transformation process between OR levels to move forward and thrive in adapting to post-pandemic changes. This study confirmed that building OR requires understanding the ways of transformations among OR levels to undertake activities in strategic areas, i.e., activity scope (AS), cooperation (CO), and finance (FI), to adapt and transform RNPOs’ in an environment of post-pandemic uncertainty.","Paluszak, Grzegorz Tadeusz Wiśniewska-Paluszak Joanna Alicja Schmidt Joanna Lira Jarosław",Agriculture,50,16

These high-risk patients currently have few options for adjuvant therapy to prevent this inevitable recurrence, with the only FDA approved therapy being high-dose interferon-alfa, which is quite toxic. However, there are now immunotherapies (anti-PD1) and targeted therapies (anti-BRAF and anti-MEK combinations) which are approved as adjuvants for Stage III patients, some of whom will have a lower baseline recurrence risk than those with Stage IIB/IIC melanoma. We sought to determine if adjuvant PD1 inhibition with nivolumab (N) would improve the recurrence free survival (RFS) compared to historical RFS rates. Methods: Our study (NCT03405155) is a single-arm, open label, multicenter, phase 2 clinical trial evaluating RFS at 24 months in patients with Stage IIB/IIC melanoma on treatment with N at 480 mg IV every 4 weeks for 12 cycles. Overall survival is a secondary endpoint. Associated translational research includes circulating tumor cell DNA and immune correlates. Results: Twenty three patients with Stage IIB and three patients with Stage IIC melanoma were enrolled onto the study and received at least one dose of N. At data cutoff, 22 patients remain in follow up, as four patients withdrew consent at different time points in the study - one patient after one dose who wished to discontinue, one due to concern for COVID and need for repeat visits, one due to insurance issues, and one due to recurrence and wish to discontinue (which was captured in study data and RFS calculations). Seventeen patients have been on the clinical trial for at least two years with nine patients having finished treatment but with less than two years follow-up;the median follow-up is currently 21.9 months. Two patients demonstrated melanoma recurrence, one after receiving cycle six of N and another one year after completing treatment, resulting in a 87.8% RFS (90% CI (64.2%-96.3%) at 2 years, compared to the historical RFS at 2 years of 70%. No N related serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed, with only 2% Grade 3 AEs observed (varied and unrelated to treatment) and all others were Grade 1-2, including 21% GI, 18% cutaneous, and 10% musculoskeletal, respiratory, and fatigue, each;overall, 2% of these Grade 1-2 AEs were treatment related. Conclusions: Our preliminary results show a trend towards improved RFS in patients with Stage IIB/IIC melanoma treated with nivolumab. The cohort has not reached a minimum follow up of at least 2 years for RFS;patients are continuing to be monitored. On study, we observed the expected adverse events, without evidence of new toxicities. Data maturation will reveal the full effect of adjuvant N on disease relapse and overall survival and distant metastasis-free survival in stage IIB/IIC melanoma patients.","Wilson, M.; Geskin, L.

Though these activities teach the comparative method that lies at the heart of our discipline, students without access to specimen collections have been excluded from this foundational experience. To fill that gap, we developed a virtual collection of photographs and 3D specimen models and designed entirely online versions of courses in ichthyology and systematics of fishes. The virtualization allows students to illustrate and compare specimens in online labs, identify species from different habitats using dichotomous keys, contextualize the relationships of species, recognize synapomorphies using a phylogeny, take online specimen-based practical exams, and help each other recognize adaptations and diagnostic features on threaded discussion boards. The classes built around the collection educate and provide university credit to students lacking access to similar courses, and their infrastructure allowed face-to-face instruction to shift online rapidly after 2020's novel coronavirus shut down our brick-and-mortar campus. While we may never be able to replicate the aroma of oil-laden alcohol online, specimen virtualization opens access to experiential learning to an underserved and widespread audience;allows new generations of students to develop crucial skills in observation, comparison, and inference;and affords substantial instructional resiliency when unexpected challenges arise.

Building on studies that demonstrate a spillover of stress across domains and individuals within families, this study examines longitudinal predictors of elevated risks for clinical depression among parents based on relational family indicators, COVID-specific stressors, and stress and emotion regulation indicators. Baseline data were collected from parents (n = 176;average age 37.04, 50% female) on April 27–28, 2020, 5 weeks after the first U.S. quarantines began. Follow-up data were collected 30 days later. Results indicated concerning levels of parents’ mental health symptoms over this short time span, including elevated stressors and exacerbated mental health symptoms for approximately one-quarter of parents. Given the need for agile service responses for those at the greatest risk, this article examines predictions of clinically significant depression through binary logistic regression. These individuals were more likely to report greater anxiety and stress symptoms, as well as report less closeness in their parent–child relationships;couple satisfaction was not a significant predictor of depression. Implications include recommended agile responses to alleviate distress and expand access to mental health supports, particularly in light of pervasive shelter-in place orders that limit access to previously established coping supports and sources of social connection (e.g., schools or community centers), that are anticipated to recur in the months ahead.

Induction of abrupt changes in arterial deoxyhemoglobin concentration ([dOHb]) can simulate intra-vascular injections of gadolinium for perfusion imaging. Aim To demonstrate the feasibility of making rapid changes in pulmonary venous hemoglobin saturation and employing the resulting changes in T2* to calculate flow metrics in the brain. Methods A gas blender with a sequential gas delivery breathing circuit and software enabling prospective arterial blood gas targeting was used to implement rapid isocapnic lung changes in the partial pressure of blood oxygen (PaO2). Lung PO2 was initially lowered to induce a low baseline [dOHb]. PaO2 was then rapidly raised to PaO2 ∼ 100 mmHg for 10 seconds and then rapidly returned to baseline. Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) MRI signal changes were measured over time. Results Arrival delay, signal amplitude and change in BOLD discriminated between large arteries, tissue and veins. The median half-time of BOLD signal in the middle cerebral artery was 1.7 s, indicating minimal dispersion confirming effective rapid modulation of pulmonary venous PO2. The contrast-to-noise ratio in the cortex was 3. Calculations of arrival delay, cerebral blood volume, mean transit time and cerebral blood flow were within normal ranges from published literature values. Conclusion Non-invasive induction of abrupt changes in [OHb] may function as a novel non-invasive vascular contrast agent for use in perfusion imaging.","Poublanc, J.; Sobczyk, O.; Shafi, R.; Duffin, J.; Uludag, K.; Wood, J.; Vu, C.; Dharmakumar, R.; Fisher, J.A.; Mikulis, D.J.",bioRxiv,50,8

Medicinal plants represent a green treasure that renders plentiful primary and secondary metabolites characterized by potent biological activities. Interestingly, the secondary metabolites, alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, and terpenoids, own a broad antiviral history. The plant antiviral capabilities may be due to inhibition of viral attachment to/penetration of the host cell;inhibition of the virus replication;suppressing RNA replication;downregulation of viral proteins translation;interfering with virus non-structural/structural protein;downregulation of virus-induced pro-inflammatory/inflammatory signaling pathways in the host cell, and antioxidant activity thus abating the virus-induced oxidative stress effect. Presently, as we are trapped with a surly virus, there are attempts to exploit the power of nature.

Data sources: We utilized individual-level data on health care use, vaccination, employment, and demographics available in the Norwegian emergency preparedness register BeredtC19. Study design: Using an event-study design with a matched comparison group and multiple time periods, we compared the change in primary and inpatient specialist care use for vaccinated health care workers from 14 days before to 14 days after the information shock on March 11th, 2021. Data collection: Not applicable. Principal findings: Primary health care use rose sharply by 66% (95%CI 60.7 to 71.3) the week following March 11th for those vaccinated with AstraZeneca (n = 87,632), compared with no rise for the unvaccinated comparison group (n = 175,264).

Conclusions: Health care use was highly affected by the media reports of a few fatal or severe side effects of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

Additionally, company managers seek to reduce labor costs and mitigate the risk of sudden worker resignation or absence due to, for example, reasons associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The aforementioned problems could be solved using the sorting algorithm proposed in this study. The concept of the proposed algorithm is based on group technology. One numerical example and two case studies are presented to demonstrate the utility of the proposed algorithm. The first example suggested that the performance of the algorithm proposed in this study is superior to another one in the literature. The second one demonstrated that the algorithm in this work achieves component standardization by reducing an initial number of 12 components down to 6. The final case study provides an effective means of grouping workers with similar operational abilities and suggests how to assign new tasks to other skilled workers if a worker resigns suddenly or cannot attend work due to pandemic prevention measures.","Li, M.

Unlike traditional literacy, there are currently few measures that can reliably measure eHealth literacy. The Transactional Model of eHealth Literacy and subsequent Transactional eHealth Literacy Instrument may provide a feasible option for measuring eHealth literacy. However, this instrument has yet to be validated, which is the aim of this study. We conducted an online cross-sectional study among 236 Vietnamese young people. Using exploratory factor analysis, we ensured that a model consisting of four factors had the best fit (RMSEA = 0.116; CFI = 0.907) and the highest internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = 0.96). A confirmatory factor analysis tested measurement invariance at four levels: configural, metric, scalar, and strict invariance. Only metric invariance was partially invariant, while the rest tested fully invariant. Even with partial metric invariance, there is reason to assume that functional, communicative, critical, and translational eHealth literacy (the four levels according to the transactional model) are consistently measured when deploying the Transactional eHealth Literacy Instrument across groups. In other words, this study suggests the instrument can be used for comparisons across groups and has the potential to generate high-quality data usable for informing change agents as to whether a particular population is proficient enough to adopt novel eHealth innovations.","Vu, G.

However, only a few indoor crowd movement trajectory datasets are available to the public, thus restricting the development of related research and application. This paper contributes a new benchmark dataset of indoor crowd movement trajectories. This dataset records the movements of over 5000 participants at a three day large academic conference in a two story indoor venue. The conference comprises varied activities, such as academic seminars, business exhibitions, a hacking contest, interviews, tea breaks, and a banquet. The participants are divided into seven types according to participation permission to the activities. Some of them are involved in anomalous events, such as loss of items, unauthorized accesses, and equipment failures, forming a variety of spatial temporal movement patterns. In this paper, we first introduce the scenario design, entity and behavior modeling, and data generator of the dataset. Then, a detailed ground truth of the dataset is presented. Finally, we describe the process and experience of applying the dataset to the contest of ChinaVis Data Challenge 2019. Evaluation results of the 75 contest entries and the feedback from 359 contestants demonstrate that the dataset has satisfactory completeness, and usability, and can effectively identify the performance of methods, technologies, and systems for indoor trajectory analysis.","Zhao, Ying; Zhao, Xin; Chen, Siming; Zhang, Zhuo; Huang, Xin",,50,1

Eligibility criteria for selected studies: Randomized and non-randomized controlled trials, where pre-participation examination including ECG was the primary intervention used to screen athletes or military 40 years of age or younger. Accepted controls were no screening, usual care, or pre-participation examination without ECG Results: 4 studies (11,689,172 participants) were included, all at high risk of bias. Pooled data from two studies (n= 3,869,274; very low quality) showed a 42% relative decrease in sudden cardiac death, equating to an absolute risk reduction of .0016%. Uncertainty was high, with a potential 67% relative decrease to a 45% relative increase in those screened with ECG based on 95% confidence intervals (RR 0.58; 95%CI 0.23, 1.45). Heterogeneity was found to be high as measured with I2 statistic (71%). Conclusion: There is very low quality evidence ECG screening decreases risk of sudden cardiac death in young athletes and military members.

The effect is teased out through solicited public opinion surveys which reach a limited sub-sample of willing participants and are expensive to conduct, leading to a slow response rate and after-the-fact results that are more suitable for historical studies than for situational awareness or crisis management. On the other hand, on social media platforms such as Twitter, millions of users provide their unsolicited opinion on almost any topic, including politics.This paper aims to initiate the conversation around the question: Can social media be used to observe the rally around the flag effect in action as it occurs, and thus help increase situational awareness? This first study utilizes the Twitter social media platform as, at the time of this writing, Twitter is used for political discourse more frequently than other mainstream social media platforms. Furthermore, Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States of America was a staunch Twitter user who almost religiously used the platform for communicating to the public, more than and even some times in place of the regular established main stream media channels such as radio and television broadcasts and long standing processes such as white house press conferences and media releases. The study was conducted on tweets from the entire 4 years of Trump's presidency with a focus on the biggest crisis during his presidency: The COVID-19 global pandemic which lead to the only, and exceptionally short-lived, rally around the flag effect for his presidency.Ultimately, the study found that sentiment towards the president on Twitter did not mimic the nation's sentiment toward the president except for a brief moment during the peak of the rally around the flag effect;which is not enough for obtaining situational awareness nor for acting decisively in a timely manner that is in accordance with public sentiment.

This phenomenon is explained by a stark difference in case demographic between the two countries. Using this as a motivating example, we introduce basic concepts from mediation analysis and show how these can be used to quantify different direct and indirect effects when assuming a coarse-grained causal graph involving country, age, and case fatality. We curate an age-stratified CFR dataset with>750k cases and conduct a case study, investigating total, direct, and indirect (age-mediated) causal effects between different countries and at different points in time. This allows us to separate age-related effects from others unrelated to age and facilitates a more transparent comparison of CFRs across countries at different stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. Using longitudinal data from Italy, we discover a sign reversal of the direct causal effect in mid-March which temporally aligns with the reported collapse of the healthcare system in parts of the country. Moreover, we find that direct and indirect effects across 132 pairs of countries are only weakly correlated, suggesting that a country's policy and case demographic may be largely unrelated. We point out limitations and extensions for future work, and, finally, discuss the role of causal reasoning in the broader context of using AI to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.","Kugelgen, Julius von; Gresele, Luigi; Scholkopf, Bernhard",,50,17

However, standard models typically represent the dynamics of disease transmission between individuals using macroscopic parameters that do not accurately represent person-to-person variability. To address this issue, we present a dynamic network model that provides a straightforward way to incorporate both disease transmission dynamics at the individual scale as well as the full spatiotemporal history of infection at the population scale. We find that disease spreads through a social network as a traveling wave of infection, followed by a traveling wave of recovery, with the onset and dynamics of spreading determined by the interplay between disease transmission and recovery. We use these insights to develop a scaling theory that predicts the dynamics of infection for diverse diseases and populations. Furthermore, we show how spatial heterogeneities in susceptibility to infection can either exacerbate or quell the spread of disease, depending on its infectivity. Ultimately, our dynamic network approach provides a simple way to model disease spreading that unifies previous findings and can be generalized to diverse diseases, containment strategies, seasonal conditions, and community structures.","Browne, Christopher A.; Amchin, Daniel B.; Schneider, Joanna; Datta, Sujit S.",,50,19

We investigated the impact of school opening with various mitigation measures (masks, rotations, mass testing) on growth rate of new cases in child cohorts ranging from kindergartens to upper secondary in Czechia, a country heavily hit by Covid-19, since April 2020 to June 2021. Methods: Our primary method is comparison of the reported infections in age cohorts corresponding to school grades undergoing different regimes. When there is no opportunity for such a comparison, we estimate corresponding coefficients from a regression model. In both the cases, we assume that district-level infections in particular cohorts depend on the school attendance and the external environment in dependence on the current overall risk contact reduction. Results: The estimates of in-cohort growth rates were significantly higher for normally opened schools compared to closed schools. When prevalence is comparable in the cohorts and general population, and no further measures are applied, the in-cohort growth reduction for closed kindergartens is 29% (SE=11%); primary: 19% (7%); lower secondary: 39% (6%); upper secondary: 47% (6%). For secondary education, mitigation measures reduce school-related growth 2-6 times. Conclusion: Considering more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants and the 'long covid' risk, mitigation measures in schools, especially in secondary levels, should be implemented for the next school year. Some infections, however, are inevitable, even in kindergartens (where mitigation measures are difficult to implement) and primary schools (where they may not work due to low adherence).","Smid, M.; Zajicek, M.; Brom, C.; Drbohlav, J.",,50,7

According to several researches, their implementation and use are beneficial, and this also applies to the management of construction projects. This specific sector is largely influenced by a large number of participants with sometimes conflicting interests. Nevertheless, knowledge technologies help the management process and increase the assumption of efficiency in a given sector. Knowledge systems in this area are closely connected with BIM technologies. There are several benefits to using these technologies. That is why it is important to examine their level of use and to map this phenomenon in the field of construction projects. This research is aimed at mapping the level of use of these technologies over the last 2 years and analyzing the trend of use in the management of construction projects.

It is unclear if the oil and gas majors will contribute towards this goal by decarbonising at the speed and scale required. Therefore, this study focuses on BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Royal Dutch Shell, the top four investor-owned companies by size of direct and indirect historical GHG emissions. Scientists at these companies knew that their products contributed to global warming by the late 1970s or earlier. For decades these companies have used a variety of tactics to slow down and shape the low-carbon transition alongside continued exploration and extraction. Discussion about the potential for these companies to meet self-imposed GHG emissions reduction targets and shift towards low-carbon technologies have been a distraction from the central question of whether they will phase out exploration for, and extraction of, oil and gas. Despite the growing disruption of the oil and gas sector, accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic, we conclude it is unlikely that the executives and directors at these four companies will decide to proactively decarbonise in line with climate science. This raises the need for further external pressure, in particular by governments, as policy makers have played a key role in previous energy transitions.","Kenner, D.; Heede, R.",Energy Research & Social Science,50,16

A fast diagnosis is crucial for patient management. Proteins that are synthesized during the inflammatory response can be used as biomarkers, helping in a rapid clinical assessment or an early diagnosis of infection. The aim of this study was to identify biomarkers of inflammation for the diagnosis and prognosis of infection in patients with suspected sepsis. Methods: In total 406 episodes were included in a prospective cohort study. Plasma was collected from all patients on the first day of a new episode. Samples were analysed using a 92-plex proteomic panel based on a proximity extension assay with oligonucleotide-labelled antibody probe pairs (OLink, Uppsala, Sweden). Supervised and unsupervised differential expression analyses and pathway enrichment analyses were performed. Results: Supervised differential expression analysis revealed 21 proteins that were significantly lower in circulation of patients with viral infections compared to patients with bacterial infections. More strongly, higher expression levels were observed for 38 proteins in patients with high SOFA scores (>4), and for 21 proteins in patients with worse outcome. These proteins are mostly involved in pathways known to be activated early in the inflammatory response. Unsupervised, hierarchical clustering confirmed that inflammatory response was more strongly related to disease severity than to aetiology. Conclusion: Several differentially expressed inflammatory proteins were identified that could be used as biomarkers for sepsis. These proteins are mostly related to disease severity. Within the setting of an emergency department, they could be used for outcome prediction, patient monitoring, and directing diagnostics.","D'Onofrio, V.; Heylen, D.; Pusparum, M.; Grondman, I.; Vanwalleghem, J.; Meersman, A.; Cartuyvels, R.; Messiaen, P.; Joosten, L.

Among those challenges is breastfeeding from the first hours after birth until late infancy, in hospitals and communities. There is a consensus throughout the world and among leading international professional medical associations that breastfeeding is of significant importance for short- and long-term health outcomes in mothers and infants, as well as for its public health impact and reduction of national health expenditures. Moreover, breastfeeding or human milk feeding have been shown to reduce morbidity, specifically respiratory infections, among infants and children. This is not the first time health systems are dealing with coronavirus outbreaks, although currently, in the COVID-19 pandemic, there is still much that is unknown. Dealing with the unknown can lead to guidelines that may not fully take into consideration relevant risk benefit ratios for individuals and groups. In this review, we aim to summarize the guidelines of different leading professional groups around the world dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence-based medicine rests on relevant scientific evidence, patients' values and preferences and clinical judgment. We wish to propose guidelines based on available evidence concerning breastfeeding, the current pandemic and weighing in potential risks and benefits while highlighting the need for ongoing breastfeeding research.","Friedman, Moran; Gur Arieh, Noa; Orbach, Ady; Haddad, Nadav; Haddad, Eloise; Zimmerman, Deena Rachel",Harefuah,50,7

Hepatozoon infection was probably an important factor contributing to mortality in two cases that exhibited clinical signs of ataxia, lethargy, ocular discharge, retching, and labored breathing before death. Whether Hepatozoon infection contributed to six deaths from fire, probable lion predation and unknown causes could not be determined. Four deaths from infanticide and starvation were unlikely to be associated with Hepatozoon infection. Histologic examination revealed lung tissue infected with cyst-like structures containing protozoan stages in all eight cases examined and interstitial pneumonia in most cases. Systemic spread of infection to several organs was found in three cases. Alignment of a 426 bp sequence from the parasite's 18s rRNA gene revealed a Hepatozoon species identical to that recently described from two domestic cats in Spain and only 7 bp substitutions when a 853 bp sequence was aligned to this cat Hepatozoon species.

The inhibition of the presumed target, the HBV DNA polymerase, by the triphosphates of some of the beta-L-cytidine derivatives was also assessed. In accordance with the cell culture data, beta-L-Hyd4C triphosphate was the most active inhibitor, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.21 microM. The cytotoxicities of some of the 4-NHOH-modified beta-L-nucleosides were dramatically lower than those of the corresponding cytidine analogues with the unmodified 4-NH(2) group. The 50% cytotoxic concentrations for beta-L-Hyd4C in HepG2 and HL-60 cells were 2,500 microM and 3,500 microM, respectively. In summary, our results demonstrate that at least beta-L-Hyd4C can be recommended as a highly efficient and extremely selective inhibitor of HBV replication for further investigations.","Matthes, E; Funk, A; Krahn, I; Gaertner, K; von Janta-Lipinski, M; Lin, L; Will, H; Sirma, H",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,50,12

The mortality rate is high in moderate and severe cases. Our study aimed to screen the CBC parameters as a useful predictive factor for COVID-19 resulting in critical illness. METHODS A total of 285 patients with positive PCR results were analyzed. The median age was 55 (24-90), and 64.2% of patients were male. Sixty-eight percent of cases were hospitalized with moderate, 32% with severe disease at initial admission. RESULTS We found that lymphocyte count <620/mcl, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) >6, and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) >350 were predictive of the outcome. We scored our cohort 0-3 for these three parameters. Patients with a score of 2-3 were more likely to have progressive disease, anti-cytokine treatment, intensive care admission, intubation, and death, compared to patients with a score of 0-1. Additionally, they tended to be hospitalized for longer (median 11.5 days, mean 15.6), compared to those with a score 0 or 1 (median 9 days, mean 11.3). Twenty-eight of 38 cases with scores of 2-3 were discharged (73.6%), whereas the rate was 89% for patients with a score of 0-1 (P=0.009). CONCLUSION Based on the absolute lymphocyte count (<620/mcl, NLR >6, PLR >350), our three-parameter score was able to predict disease progression, and the likelihood of anti-cytokine treatment, intubation, and death.

The guideline of the RIVM states that people who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 but without COVID-19 related symptoms are advised to stay in isolation for five days from time of the test.

Infectious virus can be isolated from the spinal cords of these mice and is invariably mutated in the immunodominant CD8 T-cell epitope recognized in this strain. We showed previously that these persistently infected mice did not mount a measurable serum anti-MHV neutralizing antibody response. Here we show that cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) escape was not detected in MHV-infected BALB/b mice (H-2(b) haplotype), even though the same CD8 T-cell epitopes were recognized as in B6 mice. BALB/b mice had 25-fold more MHV-specific antibody-secreting cells in the central nervous system, the site of infection, than B6 mice, suggesting that local production of anti-MHV antibody contributed to this absence of CTL escape. Additionally, administration of anti-MHV neutralizing antibody to infected B6 mice suppressed the development of CTL escape mutants. These findings indicate a key role for the anti-MHV antibody response in suppressing virus replication, thereby minimizing the emergence and competitive advantage of CTL escape mutants.","Dandekar, Ajai A; Jacobsen, Gary; Waldschmidt, Thomas J; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of virology,50,9

Since the beginning of the development of rapid autopsy, the overriding organizing principle for all RAPs has been that the samples or organs must be removed and processed as rapidly as possible. To accomplish this some rapid autopsy programs are focused just on one tumor type, while others accept patients demonstrating all tumor types and sometimes other diseases as well. RAPs are logistically complicated and labor-intensive structures, therefore, the key to their success is program flexibility and maintaining a multidisciplinary focus. The necessary collaborations in the complex relationships between clinicians and researchers can be broken down into a series of thought and action steps that must be understood, accepted, and practiced by all participants. A crucial part of the pre-case steps (prior to death) for a rapid autopsy is the study consenting process. It is extremely important that this individualized consent is obtained for postmortem specimens and that it is written in general enough terms to be used for patients with all types of diseases and for an appropriate range of future research uses. The advent of Sars-CoV-2/COVID-19 has presented new challenges and opportunities to the field of autopsy pathology. Guidelines and practice had to be created and adapted to protect physicians and staff while maximizing diagnostic yield. However, any autopsy performed on a patient dying of or with COVID-19 represents a unique opportunity to contribute to understanding of disease mechanisms and to improve death certification, thus assisting in both clinical care and the development of health public policy.","Hooper, Jody E",AJSP: reviews & reports,50,9

METHODS Thirty-six nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens from 27 patients with SARS in Shenzhen were collected. The samples were aliquotted to three parts and subjected to molecular assays for human metapneumovirus, chlamydia and a novel coronavirus, which was reported recently to be the etiologic agent of SARS. Nested RT-PCR was used to amplify the RNA polymerase gene of the novel coronavirus and the PCR products were sequenced directly or after cloned to pMD18-T vector. RESULTS Human metapneumovirus and chlamydia genes were detected in none of the specimens using the RT-PCR and nested-PCR, respectively. The novel coronavirus gene were amplified in 6 of 36 specimens, the sequence analysis indicated that this novel coronavirus is unrelated to any other coronavirus reported previously. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid alignment between this coronavirus and others was not more than 40% and 70% to 82%, respectively, while the nucleotide sequence cloned from the 6 patients were identical. CONCLUSIONS The SARS patients in Shenzhen were infected with coronavirus and this novel coronavirus is associated with SARS.

Instillation of MHV-CXCL10 into the CNS of CXCL10-deficient (CXCL10(-/-)) mice resulted in viral infection and replication in both brain and liver. Expression of virally encoded CXCL10 within the brain protected mice from death and correlated with increased infiltration of T lymphocytes, enhanced IFN-gamma secretion, and accelerated viral clearance when compared with mice infected with an isogenic control virus, MHV. Similarly, viral clearance from the livers of MHV-CXCL10-infected mice was accelerated in comparison to MHV-infected mice, yet was independent of enhanced infiltration of T lymphocytes and NK cells. Moreover, CXCL10(-/-) mice infected with MHV-CXCL10 were protected from severe hepatitis as evidenced by reduced pathology and serum alanine aminotransferase levels compared with MHV-infected mice. CXCL10-mediated protection within the liver was not dependent on CXC-chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) signaling as anti-CXCR2 treatment of MHV-CXCL10-infected mice did not modulate viral clearance or liver pathology. In contrast, treatment of MHV-CXCL10-infected CXCL10(-/-) mice with anti-CXCL10 Ab resulted in increased clinical disease correlating with enhanced viral recovery from the brain and liver as well as increased serum alanine aminotransferase levels. These studies highlight that CXCL10 expression promotes protection from coronavirus-induced neurological and liver disease.","Walsh, Kevin B; Edwards, Robert A; Romero, Kimberley M; Kotlajich, Matthew V; Stohlman, Stephen A; Lane, Thomas E",Journal of immunology,50,1

Quantitative information about TCM prescriptions, constituent herbs and herbal ingredients is necessary for studying and exploring TCM. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH We manually collected information on TCM in books and other printed sources in Medline. The Traditional Chinese Medicine Information Database TCM-ID, at http://tcm.cz3.nus.edu.sg/group/tcm-id/tcmid.asp, was introduced for providing comprehensive information about all aspects of TCM including prescriptions, constituent herbs, herbal ingredients, molecular structure and functional properties of active ingredients, therapeutic and side effects, clinical indication and application and related matters. RESULTS TCM-ID currently contains information for 1,588 prescriptions, 1,313 herbs, 5,669 herbal ingredients, and the 3D structure of 3,725 herbal ingredients. The value of the data in TCM-ID was illustrated by using some of the data for an in-silico study of molecular mechanism of the therapeutic effects of herbal ingredients and for developing a computer program to validate TCM multi-herb preparations. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS The development of systems biology has led to a new design principle for therapeutic intervention strategy, the concept of 'magic shrapnel' (rather than the 'magic bullet'), involving many drugs against multiple targets, administered in a single treatment. TCM offers an extensive source of examples of this concept in which several active ingredients in one prescription are aimed at numerous targets and work together to provide therapeutic benefit. The database and its mining applications described here represent early efforts toward exploring TCM for new theories in drug discovery.","Chen, X; Zhou, H; Liu, Y B; Wang, J F; Li, H; Ung, C Y; Han, L Y; Cao, Z W; Chen, Y Z",British journal of pharmacology,50,1

Nineteen metal compounds that exhibited a strong cytotoxic effect during a previous screening run with a 100 microM fixed dose were tested with a 72-hour exposure over a wide range of concentrations (from 0.1 microM to 1000 microM), to produce dose-effect curves to permit extrapolation of the 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) values for each metal compound. This allows the establishment of a suitable range of doses for individual metal species, for use in the subsequent Balb/3T3 assay based on a two-stage concurrent cytotoxicity and morphological transformation protocol. Another 13 metal compounds were also tested, to determine whether the Balb/3T3 cell transformation assay is really a valuable in vitro model in relation to the problem of metal speciation. Of the metal compounds assayed, 26 showed a dose related cytotoxic response with calculated IC50 values ranging from 0.25 microM (CH3HgCl) to 140 microM [(C5H5)2TiCl2], whereas six metal compounds, namely (NH4)6Mo7O24*4H2O, CH3AsO(OH)2, C2H6AsNaO2(3H2O, KBr, CrCl3*6H2O and (NH4)2[TiO(C2O4)2]*H2O, displayed no observable cytotoxicity or low cytotoxicity at all the doses tested. The determination of IC50 values permits a ranking of the cytotoxicity responses of metal compounds with the highest cytotoxicities. Dose-effect curves and IC50 values of different chemical forms of individual metal compounds of As, Br, Cr, Hg, Ir, Pt, Te, Ti and V (cationic/anionic inorganic or organometallic species) showed clearly how the chemical nature of the metal strongly influences the toxic response. This confirms that the Balb/3T3 cell line is a valuable in vitro model with respect to the problem of metal speciation. This is a fundamental aspect to be considered when incorporating the results from in vitro cell transformation assays of the carcinogenic potential of metal compounds into regulatory testing schemes. In this context, the choice of test metal species for the development and validation of such assays cannot disregard the possibility that humans will be exposed to specific chemical forms of individual metal compounds (different oxidation states, and inorganic or organometallic natures) that can profoundly affect their toxicity.","Mazzotti, Francesca; Sabbioni, Enrico; Ponti, Jessica; Ghiani, Michela; Fortaner, Salvador; Rossi, Gian Luigi",Alternatives to laboratory animals : ATLA,50,5

The pediatric age group comprises only less than 5% of total COVID-19 worldwide, therefore, large studies in this population are unlikely in the immediate future. Hence, we planned to synthesize the current data that will help in a better understanding of COVID-19 in children. METHODS Four different electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CENTRAL) were searched for articles related to COVID-19 in the pediatric population. We included studies reporting disease characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients aged less than 19 years. We performed a random-effect meta-analysis to provide pooled estimates of various disease characteristics. RESULTS 27 studies (4857 patients) fulfilling the eligibility criteria were included in this systematic review, from a total of 883 records. About half of the patients had each of fever and cough, 11% (6-17%) had fast breathing, and 6-13% had gastrointestinal manifestations. Most of the patients had mild to moderate disease, and only 4% had a severe or critical illness. Leukopenia was the commonest reported laboratory abnormality. CONCLUSION Even among the symptomatic COVID-19 cases, severe manifestations are seen in very few children.

Such cross-reactivity may lead to an autoimmune disease. On the other hand molecular mimicry between certain viral proteins and host determinant may protect invading virus to be eliminated by immune system and may promote persistence. In this mini-review I discuss the molecular mimicry of S peplomer protein of mouse hepatitis virus, strain JHM (MHV-JHM) to the host Fc gamma receptor (Fc gamma R). MHV-JHM induces in rodents acute encephalomyelitis and surviving animals develop demyelinating disease with concomitant persistent infection. We have demonstrated that rabbit IgG, but not is F(ab')2 fragments, monoclonal rat and mouse IgG and the rat 2.4G2 anti-Fc gamma R mab immunoprecipitated natural and recombinant S peplomer protein of several strains of MHV. Furthermore, MHV-JHM infected cells formed rosettes with anti-sheep red blood cell (SRBC) - antibody coated SRBC. The 2.4G2 anti-Fc gamma R mab are able to neutralize several strains of MHV, presumably by binding to S peplomer protein. Therefore, the Fc binding site of S is present on the surface of MHV-infected cells. This molecular mimicry between S peplomer protein of MHV-JHM and Fc gamma R has been extended to other members of Coronaviridae, namely bovine coronavirus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus but not to infectious bronchitis virus. The molecular mimicry of viral antigens to Fc receptors has been described also for members of Herpesviridae, namely Herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus and Varicella zoster.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Oleszak, E L",Archivum immunologiae et therapiae experimentalis,50,24

In this study, we found that type II pIFN (pIFN-gamma) also has antiviral activity against FMDV in cell culture and that, in combination with pIFN-alpha, it has a synergistic antiviral effect. We also observed that while each IFN alone induced a number of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), the combination resulted in a synergistic induction of some ISGs. To extend these studies to susceptible animals, we inoculated groups of swine with a control Ad5, 10(8) PFU of Ad5-pIFN-alpha, low- or high-dose Ad5-pIFN-gamma, or a combination of Ad5-pIFN-alpha and low- or high-dose Ad5-pIFN-gamma and challenged all groups with FMDV 1 day later. The control group and the groups inoculated with either Ad5-pIFN-alpha or a low dose of Ad5-pIFN-gamma developed clinical disease and viremia. However, the group that received the combination of both Ad5-IFNs with the low dose of Ad5-pIFN-gamma was completely protected from challenge and had no viremia. Similarly the groups inoculated with the combination of Ad5s with the higher dose of Ad5-pIFN-gamma or with only high-dose Ad5-pIFN-gamma were protected. The protected animals did not develop antibodies against viral nonstructural (NS) proteins, while all infected animals were NS protein seropositive. No antiviral activity or significant levels of IFNs were detected in the protected groups, but there was an induction of some ISGs. The results indicate that the combination of type I and II IFNs act synergistically to inhibit FMDV replication in vitro and in vivo.","Moraes, Mauro Pires; de Los Santos, Teresa; Koster, Marla; Turecek, Traci; Wang, He; Andreyev, Vladimir G; Grubman, Marvin J",Journal of virology,50,16

As diagnostic tools have increased in sensitivity, our understanding of the etiology of CAP has begun to change with a significant increase in confirmed viral infections and the recognition that multiple pathogens are frequently present. Empiric therapy remains the standard of care and guidelines are mostly based on published data from the United States or Europe. Blindly applying guidelines without any consideration of local etiological differences can lead to a risk of under or overtreatment. Several pathogens are particularly problematic in the setting of CAP in some regions as they are not covered by standard guidelines; in particular, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Burkholderia pseudomallei, and Acinetobacter baumanii. Overtreatment of patients meeting guideline criteria for healthcare-associated pneumonia is also a problem as this categorization probably only applies to a limited number of areas in the United States. New pathogens are emerging more frequently, as evidenced by severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, influenza A H1N1 09, and avian influenza, all of which have global ramifications and good clinicians need to stay informed of evolving threats. There are clearly differences in outcomes from CAP across the globe, but accurately comparing them is difficult given the vast differences in age, comorbidities, and access to healthcare.

The MAbs were found to be specific for one of three structural proteins of FIPV. A total of 47 MAbs were specific for the 205-kDa spike protein (S), 3 MAbs were specific for the 45-kDa nucleocapsid protein (N), and 4 MAbs were specific for the 26- to 28-kDa membrane protein (M). The S-specific MAbs showed various degrees of cross-reactivity with strains of FIPV, feline enteric coronavirus, canine coronavirus, and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Nineteen S-specific MAbs neutralized FIPV. A total of 15 of the neutralizing MAbs induced ADE, and all but 1 were of the immunoglobulin G2a subclass. The remaining four neutralizing MAbs that did not induce ADE were of the immunoglobulin G1 subclass. Two S-specific MAbs induced ADE but were nonneutralizing. None of the N- or M-specific MAbs was neutralizing or induced ADE. On the basis of the reactivity patterns of the MAbs with FIPV and related coronaviruses, it was concluded that there is a minimum of five neutralizing sites on S. In most instances, neutralizing MAbs were able to induce ADE, demonstrating a direct relationship between neutralization and enhancement. The difference in immunoglobulin subclass between neutralizing MAbs that induced ADE and those that did not induce ADE suggests that there may be a restriction in the immunoglobulin subclasses capable of mediating ADE.","Corapi, W V; Olsen, C W; Scott, F W",Journal of virology,50,16

Aims This study evaluated whether telementorship through video conference increased access to mentorship encounters and decreased perceived barriers to access, factors that determine likelihood to maintain mentor relationships, and quality of mentorship. Methods A year-long randomized, prospective cohort study was conducted in 2016-2017 with pairs of resident mentors from seven different training programs and medical student mentees, randomized to telementorship or in-person mentorship. The number of quarterly encounters was monitored and demographic predictors of meeting were determined. Likert scale survey responses were analyzed with linear regression. Results Forty-three of 46 (93.5%) volunteer mentor-mentee pairs participated. Telementorship did not alter likelihood of meeting or attitudes toward mentorship barriers (time and distance). Mentee satisfaction increased from 42.5% to 65.4% (P<0.05) throughout the year. Operating room-based practice (P<0.05) and higher postgraduate level (P=0.02) decreased the likelihood of meeting.

A modest anamnestic response detectable in both assays was observed after a second exposure to canine coronavirus. Cross-reacting antibodies to transmissible gastroenteritis virus were not detected by a kinetics-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (KELA), however, until after cats had received multiple daily doses of canine coronavirus (third exposure). No clinical signs attributable to canine coronavirus were seen in inoculated cats, and virus could not be isolated from fecal or rectal swabs nor identified in fecal specimens by electron microscopy. Both virus-neutralizing and KELA titers were boosted by aerosol challenge with feline infectious peritonitis virus. Antibodies produced in response to canine coronavirus did not sensitize cats to subsequent feline infectious peritonitis virus challenge, but neither did they protect cats against the challenge dose.","Barlough, J E; Stoddart, C A; Sorresso, G P; Jacobson, R H; Scott, F W",Laboratory animal science,50,17

The annual mortality rate was 4% in earlier years when management was inadequate. The main features of good husbandry were feeding at least 2.25 litres of colostrum to each calf within the first hour of life to boost its immunity while minimising infection rates by regular thorough cleaning and disinfection of calving boxes and calf pens and providing uncrowded, dry, draught free accommodation. By these means satisfactory control of early calf losses was achieved without concentrating on specific microorganisms. Detailed examinations of sacrificed moribund diarrhoeic calves showed that E. coli, cryptosporidia, rota and corona viruses were associated agents. The serum immunoglobulin level of any individual calf was an unreliable guide to its future viability because 12 out of 488 calves with high levels died whereas 53 with unacceptably low levels remained healthy. Nevertheless when calves were grouped by immunoglobulin status the highest mortality rates occurred among those with low levels. Clinical examination of diarrhoeic calves to determine the degree of dehydration was more reliable than clinical pathologic laboratory tests. Results of a treatment trial indicated that oral glucose-glycine electrolyte solution alone was as beneficial as the electrolyte plus an oral triple sulphonamide and streptomycin. This was not unexpected in view of the widespread antibiotic resistance also demonstrated.","Greene, H J",Annales de recherches veterinaires. Annals of veterinary research,50,24

Attachment of virus to specific receptors on the cell surface is a major determinant of virus tropism in pathogenesis (1). Recently, aminopeptidase-N was identified as a cell receptor for the 229e coronavirus (2). Cell receptor(s) for OC43 coronavirus have not been identified. However, it is of pathologic significance that OC43 virus shares DNA sequence homology with the two coronavirus isolates, SK and SD, from the brain of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) (3). Probing MS and control brain with probes specific for human, murine, porcine and bovine coronavirus by in situ hybridization resulted in the detection of coronavirus RNA in 12 of 22 MS brain samples; five of which were positive with the OC43 probe (4). A study of virus-ligand interactions of OC43 with human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells, which are highly susceptible to virus infection, was undertaken to identify possible cell receptors. The binding of virus collected from the supernatant of infected cells to cell proteins immobilized on nitrocellulose paper was used to screen for virus-ligand interactions. The next step was the identification or development of antibodies to each of the ligands, and to test their ability to blockade receptor activity by culturing infected cells in medium containing the ligand antibodies and measuring the effect on virus yield. The preliminary experiments reported here reveal an interesting observation of strong affinity of OC43 virus for the HLA class I antigen.","Collins, A R",Immunological investigations,50,1

MATERIALS & METHODS Between November 2009 and November 2010, 3 patients with adult polycystic kidney disease underwent bilateral hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy in our institution. Indications for bilateral nephrectomy included recurrent cyst hemorrhage, impaired gastrointestinal function and early satiety due to direct intestinal compression by large polycystic kidneys, and anatomical lack of space for future renal transplantation. We retrospectively reviewed the records of these patients and we are reporting our experience. RESULTS All three patients successfully underwent bilateral hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy with a mean operating time of 208 minutes (range 195 to 220). There were no conversions to open procedure. Blood loss was less than 100 ml in all cases. Mean renal unit size was of 2037 g (range 1798 to 2214). Hospital stay ranged from 10 to 12 days. One patient developed a chest infection postoperatively and suffered from a prolonged ileus. Another patient developed a retroperitoneal hematoma, which was treated conservatively. CONCLUSIONS Bilateral hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy is a feasible and safe procedure in adult polycystic kidney disease patients, which has potential benefits of a shorter hospital stay and reduced morbidity and mortality in comparison to open procedure.","Mak D K, C; Ilie, C P; Abedin, A; Gommersall, L; Luscombe, C; Golash, A",Journal of medicine and life,50,16

This report shares key results from a cross-sectional survey of South Dakota residents' perceptions on the impact and knowledge of COVID-19 during the early phases of the pandemic. METHODS From March 24 to April 14, 2020, South Dakota residents (n = 4,761) reported on their psychological symptoms, pandemic-related stressful experiences, top concerns regarding the pandemic, attitudes towards COVID-19, and social distancing behaviors, and where residents were getting COVID information and who they trust to provide accurate information. RESULTS Most participants were engaging in at least some social distancing and indicated at least moderate concern about COVID-19. Across age groups, getting sick from the coronavirus was the most frequently endorsed concern. Younger adults endorsed concerns about not being able to work, whereas older adults endorsed concerns about accessing medical care. The majority of the sample reported anxiety, worry, and sleep problems; about half the sample reported depressed mood, anhedonia, and appetite problems. Results highlight the importance of engaging public health experts and physicians in COVID-19 health messaging campaigns. CONCLUSIONS These data provide insight into the specific challenges experienced by adults and youth in a rural state during the early phase of the pandemic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS In this retrospective study, the proposed method takes as input a non-contrasted chest CT and segments the lesions, lungs, and lobes in three dimensions, based on a dataset of 9749 chest CT volumes. The method outputs two combined measures of the severity of lung and lobe involvement, quantifying both the extent of COVID-19 abnormalities and presence of high opacities, based on deep learning and deep reinforcement learning. The first measure of (PO, PHO) is global, while the second of (LSS, LHOS) is lobewise. Evaluation of the algorithm is reported on CTs of 200 participants (100 COVID-19 confirmed patients and 100 healthy controls) from institutions from Canada, Europe and the United States collected between 2002-Present (April, 2020). Ground truth is established by manual annotations of lesions, lungs, and lobes. Correlation and regression analyses were performed to compare the prediction to the ground truth. RESULTS Pearson correlation coefficient between method prediction and ground truth for COVID-19 cases was calculated as 0.92 for PO (P < .001), 0.97 for PHO(P < .001), 0.91 for LSS (P < .001), 0.90 for LHOS (P < .001). 98 of 100 healthy controls had a predicted PO of less than 1%, 2 had between 1-2%. Automated processing time to compute the severity scores was 10 seconds per case compared to 30 minutes required for manual annotations. CONCLUSION A new method segments regions of CT abnormalities associated with COVID-19 and computes (PO, PHO), as well as (LSS, LHOS) severity scores.","Chaganti, Shikha; Balachandran, Abishek; Chabin, Guillaume; Cohen, Stuart; Flohr, Thomas; Georgescu, Bogdan; Grenier, Philippe; Grbic, Sasa; Liu, Siqi; Mellot, François; Murray, Nicolas; Nicolaou, Savvas; Parker, William; Re, Thomas; Sanelli, Pina; Sauter, Alexander W; Xu, Zhoubing; Yoo, Youngjin; Ziebandt, Valentin; Comaniciu, Dorin",ArXiv,50,9

METHODS COVID-19 SEIR transmission dynamics model was established, which took transmission ability in latent period and tracking quarantine interventions into consideration. Based on the epidemic data of Hubei province from January 23, 2020 to February 24, 2020, the parameters of the newly established modified SEIR model were fitted. By using Euler integral algorithm to solve the modified SEIR dynamics model, the epidemic situation in Hubei province was analyzed, and the impact of prevention and control measures such as quarantine and centralized treatment on the epidemic development was discussed. RESULTS The theoretical estimation of the epidemic situation by the modified SEIR epidemic dynamics model is in good agreement with the actual situation in Hubei province. Theoretical analysis showed that prevention and control quarantine and medical follow-up quarantine played an important inhibitory effect on the outbreak of the epidemic.The centralized treatment played a key role in the rapid decline in the number of infected people. In addition, it is suggested that individuals should improve their prevention awareness and take strict self-protection measures to curb the increase in infected people. CONCLUSIONS The modified SEIR model is reliable in the evaluation of COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei province, which provides a theoretical reference for the decision-making of epidemic interventions.","Cao, Shengli; Feng, Peihua; Shi, Pengpeng",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

OBJECTIVE To examine the quality of medical care received by patients isolated for infection control. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS We identified consecutive adults who were isolated for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization or infection at 2 large North American teaching hospitals: a general cohort (patients admitted with all diagnoses between January 1, 1999, and January 1, 2000; n = 78); and a disease-specific cohort (patients admitted with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure between January 1, 1999, and July 1, 2002; n = 72). Two matched controls were selected for each isolated patient (n = 156 general cohort controls and n = 144 disease-specific cohort controls). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Quality-of-care measures encompassing processes, outcomes, and satisfaction. Adjustments for study cohort and patient demographic, hospital, and clinical characteristics were conducted using multivariable regression. RESULTS Isolated and control patients generally had similar baseline characteristics; however, isolated patients were twice as likely as control patients to experience adverse events during their hospitalization (31 vs 15 adverse events per 1000 days; P<.001). This difference in adverse events reflected preventable events (20 vs 3 adverse events per 1000 days; P<.001) as opposed to nonpreventable events (11 vs 12 adverse events per 1000 days; P =.98). Isolated patients were also more likely to formally complain to the hospital about their care than control patients (8% vs 1%; P<.001), to have their vital signs not recorded as ordered (51% vs 31%; P<.001), and more likely to have days with no physician progress note (26% vs 13%; P<.001). No differences in hospital mortality were observed for the 2 groups (17% vs 10%; P =.16).

Early career researchers (ECRs) are particularly vulnerable to the impact of the pandemic on job security and career development. The goal of this study was to capture the challenges ECRs are facing during the pandemic and the supports that are needed for career development and research. ECRs were invited to complete an online survey that focused on four major areas; the impact of COVID-19 on their research; changes in productivity due to COVID-19; changes to training due to COVID-19; and current mental health. 150 ECRs were eligible and provided sufficient data for inclusion. All but one ECRs reported their research had been negatively impacted by the pandemic. Reductions in productivity were reported by 85% of ECRs. The biggest impacts included recruitment of participants, increased needs at home and personal mental health. ECRs reported a 3-fold increase in burnout, as well as increased anxiety. ECR supports, such as funding, flexibility, and tenure extensions, are required to ensure ASD research does not suffer from a ""lost generation"" of researchers.

These efforts can be limited by the requirement for invasive or logistically difficult collection of patient samples such as blood, urine, stool, sputum, and nasopharyngeal swabs. Oral sampling is an appealing, non-invasive alternative that could greatly facilitate high-throughput sampling in community settings. Oral sampling has been described for the detection of dozens of human pathogens, including pathogens whose primary sites of infection are outside of the oral cavity, such as the respiratory pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis and SARS-CoV-2. Oral sampling can demonstrate active infections as well as resolving or previous infection, the latter through the detection of antibodies. Its potential applications are diverse, including improved diagnosis in special populations (e.g. children), population surveillance, and infectious disease screening. In this minireview, we address the use of oral samples for the detection of diseases that primarily manifest outside of the oral cavity.

METHODS: Epidemiological data were collected from registries and through a questionnaire among church attendees. Symptomatic residents and healthcare workers (HCWs) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and subjected to whole genome sequencing (WGS). Sequences from a selection of people from the same area were included as community reference. RESULTS: After the church service, 30 of 39 attendees (77%) developed symptoms; 14 were tested and were positive for COVID-19 (11 residents and 3 non-residents). In the following five weeks, 62 of 300 residents (21%) and 30 of 640 HCWs (5%) tested positive for COVID-19; 21 of 62 residents (34%) died. The outbreak was controlled through a cascade of measures. WGS of samples from residents and HCWs identified a diversity of sequence types, grouped into eight clusters. Seven resident church attendees all were infected with distinct viruses, four of which belonged to two larger clusters in the nursing home. CONCLUSIONS: Although initial investigation suggested the church service as source of the outbreak, detailed analysis showed a more complex picture, most consistent with widespread regional circulation of the virus in the weeks before the outbreak, and multiple introductions into the nursing home before the visitor ban. The findings underscore the importance of careful outbreak investigations to understand SARS-CoV-2 transmission to develop evidence-based mitigation measures.","Voeten, Helene A C M; Sikkema, Reina S; Damen, Marjolein; Oude Munnink, Bas B; Arends, Carla; Stobberingh, Ellen; Hoogervorst, Ellen; Koopmans, Marion P G; Fanoy, Ewout",Clin. infect. dis,50,16

The present study reports how the French Health Care system created temporary ICU beds to avoid being overwhelmed. METHODS: All French ICUs were contacted for answering a questionnaire focusing on the available beds and health care providers before and during the outbreak. RESULTS: Among 336 institutions with ICUs before the outbreak, 315 (94%) participated, covering 5054/5531 (91%) ICU beds. During the outbreak, 4806 new ICU beds (+95% increase) were created from Acute Care Unit (ACU, 2283), Post Anaesthetic Care Unit and Operating Theatre (PACU & OT, 1522), other units (374) or real build-up of new ICU beds (627), respectively. At the peak of the outbreak, 9860, 1982 and 3089 ICU, ACU and PACU beds were made available.

The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the impact of the pandemic, and its corresponding State of Emergency, on a tertiary traumatology emergency service. METHODS: An observational study was performed at a tertiary hospital within the Spanish National Health System. Four different periods were studied, including the first 20 days of Spain's current State of Emergency, from March 14 to April 02, 2020 (Period 4). This period was compared to the 20-day period prior to the State of Emergency (Period 3), and to matching periods in the two previous years (Periods 1 and 2). A total of 6,565 patient visits were analyzed: 1909 in Period 1 (29.1%), 2161 in Period 2 (32.9%), 1983 in Period 3 (30.2%), and 512 in Period 4 (7.8%). Variables collected included patient age and sex, insurance type, discharge destination and reason for hospital admission. RESULTS: The patients' mean age was 55.1 years old (Standard Deviation (SD): 22.1), and 51.8% were women (3495/6565). During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were significant reductions in total visits to the trauma emergency department, workplace accidents, traffic accidents and number of hospital admissions, particularly during Period 4. However, no statistically-significant differences were found in the number of osteoporotic hip fractures admitted between the four periods. The numbers of hospital admissions for osteoporotic hip fracture were 42 during Period 1, 41 during Period 2, 43 during Period 3 and 36 during Period 4. CONCLUSIONS: While most traumatological presentations decreased in frequency over the course of the outbreak, the number of osteoporotic hip fractures remained stable. Thus, contingency plans in times of crisis need to be carefully targeted, and to keep in mind certain public health issues that do not decrease, despite a State of Emergency, like osteoporotic hip fractures.","Nuñez, Jorge H; Sallent, Andrea; Lakhani, Kushal; Guerra-Farfan, Ernesto; Vidal, Nuria; Ekhtiari, Seper; Minguell, Joan",Injury,50,1

However, no efficacious BEF vaccine is currently available in China. Herein, we generated a recombinant rabies virus (RABV) expressing BEFV glycoprotein (LBNSE-BG), utilizing a reverse genetics system based on the recombinant rabies virus strain LBNSE. It was found that mice immunized with LBNSE-BG produced robust neutralizing antibodies against both BEFV and RABV, and developed complete protection from lethal RABV challenge. Further studies showed that LBNSE-BG activated more dendritic cells (DCs), B cells and T cells in immunized mice than the parent virus LBNSE. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the recombinant LBNSE-BG described here has the potential to be developed as a cost-effective and efficacious bivalent vaccine for cattle use in endemic areas of BEF and rabies.","Zheng, Wenwen; Zhao, Zhongxin; Tian, Li; Liu, Lele; Xu, Tong; Wang, Xianwei; He, Hongbin; Xia, Xianzhu; Zheng, Ye; Wei, Yurong; Zheng, Xuexing",,50,1

Respiratory illness is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients with the disease spectrum ranging from asymptomatic subclinical infection, to severe pneumonia progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is growing evidence describing pathophysiological resemblance of SARS-CoV-2 infection with other coronavirus infections such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 receptors play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the virus. Disruption of this receptor leads to cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysfunction, and heart failure. Patients with cardiovascular disease are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and they are more likely to develop severe symptoms. Hypertension, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy and coronary heart disease are amongst major cardiovascular disease comorbidities seen in severe cases of COVID-19. There is growing literature exploring cardiac involvement in SARS-CoV-2. Myocardial injury is one of the important pathogenic features of COVID-19. As a surrogate for myocardial injury, multiple studies have shown increased cardiac biomarkers mainly cardiac troponins I and T in the infected patients especially those with severe disease. Myocarditis is depicted as another cause of morbidity amongst COVID-19 patients. The exact mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 can cause myocardial injury are not clearly understood. The proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury are direct damage to the cardiomyocytes, systemic inflammation, myocardial interstitial fibrosis, interferon mediated immune response, exaggerated cytokine response by Type 1 and 2 helper T cells, in addition to coronary plaque destabilization, and hypoxia.","Babapoor-Farrokhran, Savalan; Gill, Deanna; Walker, Jackson; Rasekhi, Roozbeh Tarighati; Bozorgnia, Behnam; Amanullah, Aman",Life Sci,50,26

The Alabama Museum of the Health Sciences holds in its collections a set of medical images for the stereoscope published by Dr. S.I. Rainforth in 1910. We scanned 3 stereoscope cards from the collection at a resolution of 1200 dots per inch, then adapted the images for use in virtual reality using Adobe Photoshop and Unity. We successfully created a working application for the Oculus Go that displays the images stereoscopically in the headset. The current application allows only static display of the images. Our next steps in developing this project will be to add additional images from the collection to the virtual reality application, optimize parameters related to image display, and develop scripting that would allow users to dynamically select images from the collection.

However, few studies focused on the mental health of ICU healthcare workers. This study aimed to investigate the psychological impact of COVID-19 on ICU healthcare workers in China. Methods: We distributed the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and seven-item General Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7) online to ICU healthcare workers in China. Respondents were divided into frontline and second-line according to whether they have contact with COVID-19 patients. Depressive and anxiety symptoms of all respondents were evaluated based on their questionnaire scores. Results: There were 731 ICU healthcare workers finally enrolled in our study, including 303 (41.5%) male, 383 (52.4%) doctors, and 617 (84.4%) aged 26-45 years. All in all, 482 (65.9%) ICU healthcare workers reported symptoms of depression, while 429 (58.7%) reported anxiety. There was no significant difference between frontline (n = 325) and second-line (n = 406) respondents in depression (P = 0.15) and anxiety severity (P = 0.56). Logistic regression analysis showed that being female, ICU work time >5 years, and night duty number &#8805;10 were risk factors of developing depressive and anxiety symptoms. Income reduction was separately identified as risk of anxiety. Additionally, ICU work time >5 years was also identified as risk of developing moderate-severe depressive and anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: Frontline ICU work was not associated with higher risk of depressive and anxiety symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic remission period in China. Actions like controlling night duty number, ensuring vacation, and increasing income should be taken to relieve mental health problem. Furthermore, we should pay close attention to those who had worked long years in ICU.","Peng, Xiaofan; Meng, Xiangyu; Li, Li; Hu, Chenghuan; Liu, Wei; Liu, Zhiyong; Ma, Xinhua; Xu, Daomiao; Xing, Zhenhua; Zhu, Zhaowei; Liu, Bangshan; Zhang, Lina; Peng, Milin",Front Public Health,50,20

This year in view of COVID-19 pandemic, attitudes of HCWs towards vaccination are particularly important. A cross-sectional study was completed to understand how to best encourage and facilitate the vaccination of HCWs based on the previous years' findings. METHODS: An online survey was disseminated to all hospital staff via electronic channels. The clinical audit sphinx software was used for data collection and analysis. RESULTS: The total number of responses was n = 728, almost double the rate from 2018 (N = 393). A total of 78% (N = 551) of participants were vaccinated last year. A total of 94% (N = 677) of participants reported their intention to be vaccinated this year. The main barriers listed were being unable to find time (32%, N = 36), side effects (30%, N = 33) and thinking that it does not work (21%, N = 23). The most popular suggestions for how to increase uptake were more mobile immunisation clinics (72%, N = 517) and more information on the vaccine (50%, N = 360). A total of 82% of participants (N = 590) agreed that healthcare workers should be vaccinated, with 56% (N = 405) agreeing that it should be mandatory. Of the participants who were not vaccinated last year (N = 159), 40% (N = 63) agreed that COVID-19 had changed their opinion on influenza immunisation with a further 11% (N = 18) strongly agreeing. DISCUSSION: In light of the increasing number of survey participants, more staff were interested in flu vaccination this year than ever before. The COVID-19 pandemic has had some influence on staff's likelihood to be vaccinated. Feasibility of immunisation and education posed the largest barriers to HCW vaccination.","Kearns, Emma C; Callanan, Ian; O039,; Reilly, Ann; Purcell, Aisling; Tuohy, Niamh; Bulfin, Siobhan; Smyth, Angela; Bairead, Emer; Fitzgerald, Susan; Feeney, Eoin; Waqas, Sarmad",Ir. j. med. sci,50,1

This study aimed to explore the trend of COVID-19 infection in a peripheral region of Bangladesh during one of the largest festivals to develop an evidence-based hypothesis for its influence on the transmission rate of COVID-19. This study conducted a quantitative analysis of secondary data on COVID-19 collected from the Directorate General of Health Services Bangladesh (DGHS) and divisional director's office in the Mymensingh division. To explore the influence of one of the biggest festivals (Eid-ul-Adha) on the trend of COVID-19 infection, we analyzed data from a week before the festival to 2 weeks following the festival. The infection rate (positive cases per million of the population) and the test positivity rate (positive cases among the total number of conducted diagnostic tests) of each day during this period were calculated both for the Mymensingh region and national level. Both the test positivity rate (TPR) and infection rates in the Mymensingh region demonstrated an increasing trend. The mean test positivity rate of the Mymensingh region on the week before the festival was 9.5%. It increased to a mean test positivity rate of 13% in the following week and further rose to a rate of 17% in the next week. The infection rate of Mymensingh also increased more than 2 folds from the day of the festival (2.0-5.3 cases per million) within the next 2 weeks. The TPR and infection rate on the national level remained similar throughout the study period. Mass mobility during Eid-ul-Adha influences the increased transmission of COVID-19 among the peripheral regions of Bangladesh from the central capital city Dhaka. The findings will help policymakers plan and implement travel restrictions during festivals during the pandemic in LMICs.","Rahman, Farah Naz; Rahman, A K M Fazlur; Iwuagwu, Anthony Obinna; Dalal, Koustuv",Inquiry,50,16

To unravel the long-term trends of aerosol pollution over this region, in this study, measurements from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer instrument onboard the Terra satellite were analyzed over two decades, from 2001 to 2020. Fine-mode aerosol optical depth (AOD(f)) was calculated to estimate the amount of aerosol produced by anthropogenic emissions. The results showed that the AOD(f) over the SIS increased from 2001 to 2004, had a flat trend from 2005 to 2009, and decreased from 2010 to 2020. To clarify the impact of long-range transport from the Asian continent to the SIS, the AOD(f) over the Yellow Sea was also investigated and was found to increase and level off during the 2000s, after which it decreased, especially after 2014. This decrease can be attributed to emission regulations in China. The above analysis suggests that the aerosol pollution status in the SIS during the late 2010s was similar to that during the early 2000s. Over the SIS, the lowest AOD(f) value was found in 2020, with the values in January-March and June-July approximately 30% and 30%-60% lower than the average values during the same periods in 2018-2019, respectively. The reduction found in January-March could be related to the decline in the long-range transport with restrictions on human activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the reduction during June-July could be related to the decline of local emission sources. Considering the large SO2 decline in 2020, regulations on SO2 emitted from ships that started from 1 January 2020 are one possible factor for the improvement of aerosol pollution over the SIS in 2020.","Itahashi, S.; Sakurai, T.; Shimadera, H.; Araki, S.; Hayami, H.",Environmental Research Letters,50,30

Methods: We performed a systematic literature review using PubMed according to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines evaluating relevant literature from the past 15 years. Results: Out of 679 screened abstracts, 12 studies investigating time to surgery in lung cancer were included. In stage I-II lung cancer, delayed resection beyond 6 to 8 weeks is consistently associated with lower survival. No identified evidence justifies a 2 cm cutoff for immediate versus delayed surgery. For stage IIIa lung cancer, time to surgery greater than 6 weeks after neoadjuvant therapy is similarly associated with worse survival. For esophageal cancer, 254 abstracts were screened and 23 studies were included. Minimal literature addresses primary esophagectomy, but time to surgery over 8 weeks is associated with lower survival. In the neoadjuvant setting, longer time to surgery is associated with increased pathologic complete response, but also decreased survival. The optimal window for esophagectomy following neoadjuvant therapy is 6 to 8 weeks. Conclusions: In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, timely resection of lung and esophageal cancer should be prioritized whenever possible based upon local resources and disease-burden.","Fligor, Scott C; Tsikis, Savas T; Wang, Sophie; Ore, Ana Sofia; Allar, Benjamin G; Whitlock, Ashlyn E; Calvillo-Ortiz, Rodrigo; Arndt, Kevin; Callery, Mark P; Gangadharan, Sidhu P",J Thorac Dis,50,1

Our results show that isolates LJL/140820 and I0306/17 may be derived from the Ma5 (another Mass-type live-attenuated vaccine strain) and H120 vaccine strains, respectively. The I1124/16 strain was found to be a M41 variant that likely resulted from nucleotide accumulated mutations in the genome. Consistently, the results of the virus neutralization test showed that isolate I1124/16 was antigenically related but slight different from the M41. Our results from the protection experiments pointed out that chickens immunized with H120 failed to eliminate viral shedding after infection with the isolate I1124/16, which was different from that of M41; this result was consistent to the field observation and further implicated that the variant IBV isolate I1124/16 was antigenic different from the M41 strain. Furthermore, the I1124/16 was found to have comparable but slightly lower pathogenicity with the M41 strain. More studies based on the reverse genetic techniques are needed to elucidate the amino acids in the S1 subunit of spike protein contributing to the altered antigenicity of the isolate I1124/16. In addition, an IBV isolate, LJL/130609, was found to be originated from recombination events between the I1124/16- and Connecticut-like strains. Our results from the virus neutralization test also showed that isolates LJL/130609 and I1124/16 were antigenic closely related. Hence, there are at least 3 different genetic evolution patterns for the circulation of the GI-1/Mass-type IBV field strains in China. The differences of vaccines used, the field conditions and genetic pressures between different flocks, likely account for the emergence, evolution patterns, and characteristics of the Mass-type IBV strains.","Sheng, Jie; Ren, Mengting; Han, Zongxi; Sun, Junfeng; Zhao, Yan; Liu, Shengwang",Poult Sci,50,20

Like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a respiratory virus infecting the lungs with fever, dry cough, and acute pneumonia being the major symptoms. It infects epithelial cells expressing angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is crucial for viral entry. Based on evolving clinical evidence, it is now unfitting to label SARS-CoV-2 as just a respiratory virus, as lately there are various reports that substantiate its pathogenicity in other organs of the body, including brain. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS and MERS along with possibilities of viral entry into central nervous system (CNS) tissues. The review provides detailed information about the virulence, epidemiology, and insights into molecular pathways involved in the infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, along with an in-depth view of current concepts about the neurological significance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its neuropathological competence. The review also touches upon our current understanding of placental transmission of SARS-CoV-2, an important aspect of vertical transmission. Furthermore, the review provides a current update on strategies that have been used, are being used, or are under trial for treating the disease.","Singal, Chitra Mohinder Singh; Jaiswal, Paritosh; Seth, Pankaj",ACS Chem Neurosci,50,17

METHODS: We screened 6969 patients who had organ transplantations in our center for COVID-19. Specific data on presentation, clinical course, treatment and prognosis was acquired. RESULTS: We found 85 patients (66 liver, 16 kidney, 2 kidney-pancreas and 1 liver-kidney recipient) who acquired COVID-19. Most common symptoms included fever (48.2%), cough (41.2%), myalgia (41.2%), and fatigue (40%). Dyspnea developed in 33% of patients. Overall, one-third of patients had an oxygen saturation of bellow 90% on admission. Patients were hospitalized for a median (IQR) of 9 (5, 13.7) days and had a 33.9% ICU admission rate. Overall, 17 patients (20%) died which included 31.3% of patients with kidney transplantations and 21.9% of patients with liver transplantations.All 4 pediatric patients in our series died. In our univariate analysis among adults, rates of leukopenia (38.4% vs. 13.2%; p=0.04), low albumin levels (53.8% vs. 10.2%; p=0.001), and shorter duration between transplantation and COVID-19 (p=0.02), were higher among patients who died.In our LASSO regression model, low albumin levels (OR: 4.48, 95% CI= 1.16-17.27) were associated with higher risk of death. CONCLUSION: This is the largest single-center report on abdominal transplantations and COVID-19.

METHODS This study applied a mathematical model to estimate the increase in the number of cases in São Paulo state, Brazil during four epidemic periods and the subsequent 300 days. We used different types of dynamic transmission models to measure the effects of social distancing interventions, based on local contact patterns. Specifically, we used a model that incorporated multiple transmission pathways and an environmental class that represented the pathogen concentration in the environmental reservoir and also considered the time that an individual may sustain a latent infection before becoming actively infectious. Thus, this model allowed us to show how the individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts can influence the model parameters and change the rate of exposure of susceptible individuals to those who are infected. RESULTS The estimated basic reproductive number, R o , was 3.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.48 - 3.72). The mathematical model data prediction coincided with the real data mainly when the social distancing measures were respected. However, a lack of social distancing measures caused a significant increase in the number of infected individuals. Thus, if social distancing measures are not respected, we estimated a difference of at least 100,000 cases over the next 300 days. CONCLUSIONS: Although the predictive capacity of this model was limited by the accuracy of the available data, our results showed that social distancing is currently the best non-pharmacological measure.","Cruz, Pedro Alexandre da; Crema-Cruz, Leandra Cristina; Campos, Fabrício Souza",Rev.

Along with the obvious advantages of online learning such as cost reduction, cross-border opportunities for receiving it, and adaptability for students, educational institutions encounter specific difficulties: a lack of optimal teaching methods, inflexibility of the institutional environment to the use of new teaching technologies, the transformation of communication between teachers and students, and technological unpreparedness for the development of online learning. At the same time, the need to solve the problem of accessibility of education and fill the shortage of labor resources in Russia, in particular its Arctic zone (AZRF), will contribute to the spread of online learning practices. To consider developing online education, this article, on the one hand, presents the results of a study of the regional employers’ confidence in education in a non-traditional format and, on the other hand, shows the readiness of vocational educational institutions to implement training programs in a distance format. The main research method was a questionnaire survey, in which 2240 organizations and 344 professional educational institutions located in the Russian Arctic took part. The survey results indicate that more than half of employers (58%) declared the applicability of online learning in the Russian Arctic, but about 40.6% of companies do not consider applicants with a diploma from online education. At the same time, employers’ confidence in distance learning in higher education is lower than in vocational secondary education. Additionally, the majority of institutions of higher education (62.5%) believe in the possibility of using distance education in the Russian Arctic, while organizations of vocational secondary education (64.98%) have the opposite opinion.

We, therefore, started to use auto-hemotherapy treated with an oxygen/ozone (O2/O3) gaseous mixture as adjuvant therapy. In Udine University Hospital (Italy) we performed a case-control study involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 with mild to moderate pneumonia. Clinical presentations are based upon clinical phenotypes identified by the Italian Society of Emergency and Urgency Medicine (SIMEU-Società Italiana di Medicina di Emergenza-Urgenza) and patients that met criteria of phenotypes 2 to 4 were treated with best available therapy (BAT), with or without O3-autohemotherapy. 60 patients were enrolled in the study: 30 patients treated with BAT and O2/O3 mixture, as adjuvant therapy and 30 controls treated with BAT only. In the group treated with O3-autohemotherapy plus BAT, patients were younger but with more severe clinical phenotypes. A decrease of SIMEU clinical phenotypes was observed (2.70 ± 0.67 vs. 2.35 ± 0.88, p = 0.002) in all patients during hospitalization but this clinical improvement was statistically significant only in O3-treated patients (2.87 ± 0.78 vs. 2.27 ± 0.83, p < 0.001), differently to the control group (2.53 ± 0.51 vs. 2.43 ± 0.93, p = 0.522).

This information supports WHO's decision making process for declaring a public health emergency of international concern. It also aides the WHO to work with governments to coordinate efforts to contain cross-border outbreaks.Given the importance of information sharing by governments, it is not surprising that governments that withhold or delay sharing information about outbreaks within their borders are often condemned by the international community for non-compliance with the International Health Regulations. The barriers to rapid and transparent information sharing are numerous. While governments must be held accountable for delaying or withholding information, in many cases non-compliance may be a rational response to real and perceived risks rather than a problem of technical incapacity or a lack of political commitment. Improving adherence to the International Health Regulations will require a long-term process to build trust that incorporates recognizing and mitigating the potential and perceived risks of information sharing.","Lencucha, Raphael; Bandara, Shashika",Global Health,50,1

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we studied 82 hospital workers with IMD (mean age: 42.2 ± 10.0 years) and 300 (mean age: 41.7 ± 9.9 years) controls. Among + 65 aged population, we studied 22 (mean age: 71.4 ± 4.5 years) patients and 47 controls (mean age: 70.9 ± 4.8 years). All study subjects had a negative history for COVID-19. Sera were obtained after at least 21 days following the second vaccination. Anti-spike IgG antibody titers were measured quantitatively using a commercially available immunoassay method. RESULTS: Patients with IMD were significantly less likely to have detectable antibodies than healthy controls both among the hospital workers (92.7% vs 99.7%, p < 0.001) and elderly population (77.3% vs 97.9%, p = 0.011). Among patients with IMD, those using immunosuppressive or immune-modulating drugs (64/75, 85.3%) were significantly less likely to have detectable antibodies compared to those off treatment (29/29, 100%) (p = 0.029). Additionally, a negative association between age and the antibody titer categories among patients (r = - 0.352; p < 0.001) and controls (r = - 0.258; p < 0.001) were demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospital workers, the vast majority of patients with IMD and immunocompetent controls developed a significant humoral response following the administration of the second dose of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. This was also true for the elderly population, albeit with lower antibody titers. Immunosuppressive use, particularly rituximab significantly reduced antibody titers. Antibody titers were significantly lower among those aged &#8805; 60 years both in patient and control populations. Whether these individuals should get a booster dose warrants further studies.","Seyahi, Emire; Bakhdiyarli, Guldaran; Oztas, Mert; Kuskucu, Mert Ahmet; Tok, Yesim; Sut, Necdet; Ozcifci, Guzin; Ozcaglayan, Ali; Balkan, Ilker Inanc; Saltoglu, Nese; Tabak, Fehmi; Hamuryudan, Vedat",Rheumatol Int,50,1

Health care providers are overwhelmed, resulting in clinical teams spread more thinly. We aimed to assess the impact of introducing an app-based remote patient monitoring system (Huma Therapeutics) on a clinician's workload in the context of a COVID-19-specific virtual ward. OBJECTIVE: This prospective feasibility study aimed to evaluate the health economic effects (in terms of clinical workload) of a mobile app on a telephone-based virtual ward used in the monitoring of patients with COVID-19 who are clinically ready for discharge from the hospital. METHODS: A prospective feasibility study was carried out over 1 month where clinician workload was monitored, and full-time equivalents savings were determined. An NHS hospital repurposed a telephone-based respiratory virtual ward for COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 in the amber zone (according to the National Health Service definition) were monitored for 14 days postdischarge to help identify deteriorating patients earlier. A smartphone-based app was introduced to monitor data points submitted by the patients via communication over telephone calls. We then comparatively evaluated the clinical workload between patients monitored by telephone only (cohort 1) with those monitored via mobile app and telephone (cohort 2). RESULTS: In all, 56 patients were enrolled in the app-based virtual ward (cohort 2). Digital remote patient monitoring resulted in a reduction in the number of phone calls from a mean total of 9 calls to 4 calls over the monitoring period. There was no change in the mean duration of phone calls (8.5 minutes) and no reports of readmission or mortality. These results equate to a mean saving of 47.60 working hours. Moreover, it translates to 3.30 fewer full-time equivalents (raw phone call data), resulting in 1.1 fewer full-time equivalents required to monitor 100 patients when adjusted for time spent reviewing app data. Individual clinicians spent an average of 10.9 minutes per day reviewing data. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone-based remote patient monitoring technologies may offer tangible reductions in clinician workload at a time when service is severely strained. In this small-scale pilot study, we demonstrated the economic and operational impact that digital remote patient monitoring technology can have in improving working efficiency and reducing operational costs. Although this particular RPM solution was deployed for the COVID-19 pandemic, it may set a precedent for wider utilization of digital, remote patient monitoring solutions in other clinical scenarios where increased care delivery efficiency is sought.","Shah, Sachin Shailendra; Gvozdanovic, Andrew; Knight, Matthew; Gagnon, Julien",JMIR Form Res,50,15

This sudden shift to distance learning has put the pharmacy education system through an extraordinary experience that may impact its future. Objective: To investigate the effect emergency remote teaching has had on pharmacy education in Saudi Arabia, and to provide recommendations that may help set in place a contingency strategy. Methods: Two cross-sectional Likert-scale based questionnaires targeted at students and teachers separately, designed to explore stakeholders' satisfaction in three areas of emergency distance teaching/learning: The use of virtual classrooms, completion of course learning outcomes (CLOs) and assessment via alternative methods during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Furthermore, phone interviews were conducted with teachers and students to discuss results from both questionnaires for further clarity on teacher and student views. Results: Over 700 pharmacy students, from 19 different local colleges, and 74 faculty members from 10 different local colleges have participated in this study. While it was challenging for the majority of teachers (&gt;60%) to delivery complex scientific concepts over virtual classrooms, &gt;35% of students and 60% of teachers have expressed concerns on the lack of student–student and student–teacher interactions.

Mobility between residents and facilities may result in staff acting as vectors of COVID-19 infection in these spaces. Vaccine uptake has been shown to markedly reduce the spread of COVID-19, yet there is little data on vaccine uptake and the continued COVID-19 risk among residents. MethodsData for this study were extracted from two publicly available. First, Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) public data included characteristics of nursing homes, weekly reported observations of residential COVID-19 cases, and COVID-19 vaccine coverage of staff and residents. Second, average weekly COVID-19 infection rate from Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (MDHSS) were extracted and aggregated. A zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression model was constructed to predict (1) if COVID-19 infections were reported, and if so, (2) the number of cases reported using a priori variables as predictors. ZIP regression was used due to the count nature of the outcome and due to the pre-determined overdispersion of observations when zero COVID-19 cases were reported during the study period. ResultsA total of 504 nursing homes were included in the study and 1124 COVID-19 infections were reported during the study period. As the percent of vaccinated staff increased, the risk of COVID-19 infections among residents significantly decreased. Percent of residents vaccinated was not significantly associated with whether COVID-19 cases were reported, nor the number of cases reported. Other factors, such as county COVID-19 rate and CMS staff rating, were significantly associated with COVID-19 cases in nursing homes. DiscussionThis study identified that nursing home staff, likely due to greater mobility, are important to prioritize in vaccination efforts to protect themselves and residents of their facilities from COVID-19 infections. Further, the CMS staff ratings were significant predictors of infection as well, which highlight the structural challenges that exist within and outside the context of a highly infectious and deadly pandemic. These results also provide insights to optimizing vaccination roll-out to best protect our communities most vulnerable residents.","Scroggins, Stephen; Ellis, Matthew; Shacham, Enbal",,50,1

To contextualize recent findings, we offer a summative review of recent literature focused on modeling transmission of pathogens in healthcare settings. RECENT FINDINGS: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic shift in the modeling landscape as the healthcare community has raced to characterize the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and develop effective interventions. Inequities in COVID-19 outcomes have inspired new efforts to quantify how structural bias impacts both health outcomes and model parameterization. Meanwhile, developments in the modeling of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridioides difficile, and other nosocomial infections continue to advance. Machine learning continues to be applied in novel ways, and genomic data is being increasingly incorporated into modeling efforts. SUMMARY: As the type and amount of data continues to grow, mathematical, statistical, and computational modeling will play an increasing role in healthcare epidemiology. Gaps remain in producing models that are generalizable to a variety of time periods, geographic locations, and populations. However, with effective communication of findings and interdisciplinary collaboration, opportunities for implementing models for clinical decision-making and public health decision-making are bound to increase.","Stachel, Anna; Keegan, Lindsay T; Blumberg, Seth",Curr. opin. infect. dis,50,25

METHODS: The epidemiology, clinical symptoms, laboratory and radiologic data of 23 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Fifth People's Hospital of Xinyang City from January 22nd to January 29th, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There was 23 patients with COVID-19, with 15 men and 8 women, and the median age was 46.0 (40.5, 52.0) years old (ranged from 27 years old to 80 years old). Nine patients had basic disease (39.1%), including hypertension (17.4%), cardiovascular diseases (17.4%), diabetes (8.7%), hypothyroidism (4.3%) and past history of tuberculosis (4.3%). All the 23 patients had contact history in Wuhan area or with confirmed cases. Clinical symptoms included fever (100%), cough (69.6%), expectoration (43.5%), myalgia (26.1%), headache (17.4%) and dyspnea (17.4%), and the less common symptom was diarrhea (4.3%). Blood routine tests showed leukocytopenia in 11 patients (47.8%), normal leukocyte counts in 10 patients (43.5%), and leukocytosis in 2 patients (8.7%); lymphopenia was found in 13 patients (56.5%). All 23 patients had different degrees of infective lesions in chest CT, with 7 patients (30.4%) on one side and 16 patients (69.6%) on both sides. There were 19 mild patients, 4 severe patients, and no critical or death case. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (17.4%). No patient was reported with liver, kidney or heart dysfunction or secondary infection. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemic history of contact, fever, pneumonia signs of chest CT, normal or decreased count of leukocyte and lymphopenia are the clinical basis for diagnosis of COVID-19. However, at present, the treatment of patients has not been completed, and the effective treatment strategy and final prognosis are unclear.","Xu, Ming; Li, Mengdie; Zhan, Weiqiang; Han, Tao; Liu, Litao; Zhang, Guosheng; Lu, Yibin",Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue,50,1

METHODS: Prospective study of 82 patients ventilated on proportional assist ventilation (PAV+). At three levels of assist (20 %-50 %-80 %), patients' inspiratory effort and breathing pattern were evaluated using a validated prototype monitor. RESULTS: Independent of the assist level, a wide range of respiratory rates (16-35br/min) was observed when patients' effort was within the accepted range. Changing the assist level resulted in paired changes in inspiratory effort and rate of the same tendency (increase or decrease) in all but four patients. Increasing the level in assist resulted in a 31 % (8-44 %) decrease in inspiratory effort and a 10 % (0-18 %) decrease in respiratory rate. The change in respiratory rate upon the change in assist correlated modestly with the change in the effort (R = 0.5). CONCLUSION: Changing assist level results in changes in both respiratory rate and effort in the same direction, with change in effort being greater than that of respiratory rate. Yet, neither the magnitude of respiratory rate change nor the resulting absolute value may reliably predict the level of effort after a change in assist.","Lilitsis, Emmanouil; Stamatopoulou, Vaia; Andrianakis, Eleftherios; Petraki, Adamantia; Antonogiannaki, Elvira-Markela; Georgopoulos, Dimitrios; Vaporidi, Katerina; Kondili, Eumorfia",Respir Physiol Neurobiol,50,16

From radiologists to anesthesiologists, all specialists had to change their way of working and to rapidly learn new tasks and procedures. Importantly, some groups of individuals appear more vulnerable than others to the development of psychological issues. Typical coping strategies, endorsed by the general population and media, are represented by technology-based communication, reading, humor, and entertainment, such as watching TV or listening to music. However, not everyone disposes of the resources to cope with their own emotions using these strategies or may not perceive any real benefit. Insomnia and alterations of sleep patterns are indeed among the main issues reported during the pandemic. This is partially due to the changes in daily routines and habits, but also to anguish and internal tension. The era of COVID-19 is in fact the era of telepsychiatry: psychiatry and related disciplines are going through a real revolution. The direct, personal, empathic contact that we usually experiment with patients in the clinical setting has now to move virtually. Thus, there is an urgent need to adapt and tailor psychopathology to this new setting. In conclusion, the challenges that one is facing and will have to face in the near future should represent a stimulus for a real renovation of psychopathology.

The present study is an attempt at investigating the psychological challenges and issues which the families of COVID-19 victims are faced with. The present study aims to identify the Mental Health crises which the families of COVID-19 deceased victims are going through. METHODS: A qualitative research, the present study uses a conventional content analysis design. The participants were 16 members of the families of COVID-19 victims selected from medical centers in Iran from February to May 2020 via purposeful sampling. Sampling continued to the point of data saturation Data were collected via semi-structured individual interviews conducted online. The collected data were analyzed according to the conventional qualitative content analysis approach. RESULTS: Analyses of the data yielded two main themes and seven categories. Emotional shock included (feelings of guilt and rumination, bitter farewell, strange burial and concern about unreligious burial), and fear of the future included (instability in the family, lack of job security and difficult financial conditions, Stigmatization and complications in social interactions). CONCLUSION: The families of COVID-19 deceased victims are affected by various psychological crises which have exposed them to a deep sense of loss and emotional shock. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a cultural context which recognizes and supports all the various aspects of the mental health of these families.","Mohammadi, Fateme; Oshvandi, Khodayar; Shamsaei, Farshid; Cheraghi, Fateme; Khodaveisi, Masoud; Bijani, Mostafa",BMC Fam Pract,50,24

Methods: A systematic literature search on PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were performed up until 18th February 2021. Fasting hyperglycemia was defined as fasting plasma glucose level above the reference value. The outcome of interest was poor outcome, which was a composite of mortality and severe COVID-19. The effect estimate was in odds ratio (OR). Results: There were 9,045 patients from 12 studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The prevalence of fasting hyperglycemia was 29%. The incidence of poor outcome was 15%. Fasting hyperglycemia was associated with poor outcome in COVID-19 (OR 4.72 [3.32, 6.72], p<0.001; I2: 69.8%, p<0.001). Subgroup analysis in patients without prior history of diabetes showed that fasting hyperglycemia was associated with poor outcome in COVID-19 (OR 3.387 [2.433, 4.714], p<0.001; I2: 0, p=0.90). Fasting hyperglycemia has a sensitivity of 0.57 [0.45, 0.68], specificity of 0.78 [0.70, 0.84], PLR of 2.6 [2.0, 3.3], NLR of 0.55 [0.44, 0.69], DOR of 5 [3, 7], and AUC of 0.74 [0.70, 0.78] for predicting poor outcome. In this pooled analysis, fasting hyperglycemia has a 32% post-test probability for poor outcome, and absence of fasting hyperglycemia confers to a 9% post-test probability. Meta-regression and subgroup analysis showed that the sensitivity and specificity varies by chronic kidney disease but not by age, male (gender), hypertension, and chronic kidney disease.

Few studies have explored their combined mental health effects on young people. While self-focused rumination has been suggested to be a key mechanism underlying depression, the role of event-based rumination in mediating the impact of population stressors has yet to be elucidated. METHODS: Data were collected from 6988 young people in a large-scale community online survey in Hong Kong. The survey assessed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, direct exposure to social unrest-related traumatic events, coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic-related events, personal stressful life events, event-based rumination and other individual risk factors. RESULTS: High levels of comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms were observed. Logistic regression analysis revealed that probable post-traumatic stress disorder was associated with traumatic events (odds ratio = 1.73, 95% confidence interval = [1.64, 1.82]), pandemic-related events (odds ratio = 1.08, confidence interval = [1.01, 1.16]), stressful life events (odds ratio = 1.20, confidence interval = [1.21, 1.37]), high event-based rumination (odds ratio = 3.00, confidence interval = [2.58, 3.48]), lower resilience (odds ratio = 1.18, confidence interval = [1.15, 1.21]), higher smartphone reliance (odds ratio = 1.09, confidence interval = [1.05, 1.13]) and financial concerns (odds ratio = 1.25, confidence interval = [1.18, 1.33]). The odds for probable post-traumatic stress disorder was also significantly higher when two or more traumatic events were experienced (odds ratio = 4.03, confidence interval = [3.52, 4.62]). Factors associated with moderate-to-severe level depressive symptoms were similar. Event-based rumination significantly mediated between different types of external events (traumatic events, pandemic-related events, stressful life events) and both post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that diverse types of stressful events during population-level crises could add to personal stressors to affect mental health outcomes in young people. Among other protective and risk factors, event-based rumination presented as a prominent transdiagnostic mediator for different symptom dimensions which may be a potentially important target for early risk detection and intervention.","Wong, Stephanie My; Hui, Christy Lm; Suen, Yi Nam; Wong, Corine Sm; Chan, Sherry Kw; Lee, Edwin Hm; Chang, Wing Chung; Chen, Eric Yh",Aust N Z J Psychiatry,50,18

It was evident that infection resulted in upper respiratory tract symptoms, with the lungs being most commonly affected1. Clinicians have been scrambling to identify radiographic findings that could predict infection with the virus. Computed tomography (CT) scanning of the chest has become the modality of choice. Ground glass opacities (GGO) are identified in a large majority of cases but other radiographic changes such as laterality, consolidation, lobe involvement, and vascular abnormalities also give signal to COVID-19. In this case, COVID-19 resulted in a crazy-paving pattern which has only been found in 34.9% of COVID-19 patients2. Introduction: More than 70% of COVID patients have CT abnormalities that include GGO, vascular enlargement, bilateral abnormalities, lower lobe involvement, and posterior predilection. We present a case of a linear pattern superimposed on a background of GGO resembling irregularly shaped paving stones, “crazy paving”. Case presentation: A 92 year old female with a past medical history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, reflux, and immune thrombocytopenic purpura presented to the emergency department with cough, nausea and fatigue for two days. She was afebrile and exam revealed new onset atrial fibrillation. Laboratory studies showed thrombocytopenia of 62 k/mcL, elevated lactate dehydrogenase of 443 U/L, and elevated CRP of 7.4 mg/dL. Chest radiography showed a questionable opacity in the right upper lobe concerning for pneumonia. Rapid antigen testing for Sars-CoV-2 returned positive. She developed progressively worsening hypoxemia and dyspnea prompting a chest CT scan that was negative for pulmonary embolism, but GGO were noted in the right upper and lower lobes with a crazy-paving appearance. Remdesivir, dexamethasone, and convalescent plasma was administered. She improved and was discharged to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Discussion: Crazypaving can be seen in many conditions - most commonly pulmonary edema, infection, hemorrhage, acute interstitial pneumonia, adult respiratory distress syndrome, radiation pneumonitis and eosinophilic pneumonia3. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses found crazy-paving in 34.9% of CT scans of the chest in patients with COVID-192. This case highlights crazy-paving as a radiographic finding on CT scan of the chest. Conclusion: It is evident that as more data accumulates about radiographic findings and treatment of COVID-19, that COVID- 19 does not have pathognomonic radiological findings.","Rovnan, H.; Young, M.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,50,20

The aim of the present study was to analyze the emotional status among the health care workers form the Hospital of Igualada (Barcelona), while they were facing with Covid-19 in one of the most affected regions in all of Europe. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 395 participants were included in the study. A cross-sectional assessment was carried out between the months of March and April. Information about anxiety, depression, and stress was gathered. We also collected demographic data and concerning potentially stressful factors. RESULTS: A significant proportion of professionals reported symptoms of anxiety (31.4%) and depression (12.2%) from moderate to severe intensity. Symptoms of acute stress were reported by 14.5% of participants. We performed a regression analysis, which explained the 30% of the variance associated with the degree of emotional distress (Ry=0.30). The final model reveals that females (or young males), who are working in the frontline as nursing assistants, caretakers or radiology technicians, with the uncertainty of a possible infection, the perception of inadequate protection measures and having experienced the death of a close person by Covid-19, showed a heightened risk of experiencing psychological distress.

We also investigated whether COVID-19 is associated with a different clinical picture or a more severe course of illness in PWE (compared with others). METHODS: All consecutive patients who referred to and admitted at healthcare facilities anywhere in Fars province (located in the south of Iran with a population of 4,851,000 people) from February 19, 2020 until November 20, 2020 were included. RESULTS: A total of 37,968 patients were studied. Eighty-two patients (0.2%) had pre-existing epilepsy. Seizures were significantly more frequent among PWE as a presenting manifestation of COVID-19 compared with that in people without epilepsy (Odds Ratio = 27; p = 0.0001). Furthermore, PWE less often reported cough (significantly) and more often had gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting and anorexia; as trends) compared with those in people without epilepsy. Patients with epilepsy were not differently likely to be intubated or admitted at ICUs. Case fatality rates were not different between the two groups [9.8% in PWE and 8.5% in people without epilepsy; p = 0.690]. CONCLUSION: Patients with epilepsy are not susceptible to contracting COVID-19 more than other individuals. Furthermore, COVID-19 in PWE is not associated with a more severe illness or a poorer prognosis. However, PWE and COVID-19 may present somewhat differently than others with such an illness. Why PWE less often present with cough and more often present with gastrointestinal symptoms is not clear yet and should be investigated and clarified in the future studies.","Asadi-Pooya, Ali A; Emami, Amir; Akbari, Ali; Javanmardi, Fatemeh",Acta neurol. scand,50,24

Methods: Coronavirus and heart failure were searched in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and omics data were selected to meet experimental requirements. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed using the Limma package in R language to screen for differentially expressed genes. The two sets of differential genes were introduced into the R language cluster Profiler package for gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto gene and genome encyclopedia (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Two sets of intersections were taken. A protein interaction network was constructed for all differentially expressed genes using STRING database and core genes were screened. Finally, the apparently accurate treatment prediction platform (EpiMed) independently developed by the team was used to predict the therapeutic drug. Results: The GSE59185 coronavirus data set was searched and screened in the GEO database, and divided into wt group, &#916;E group, &#916;3 group, &#916;5 group according to different subtypes, and compared with control group. After the difference analysis, 191 up-regulated genes and 18 down-regulated genes were defined. The GEO126062 heart failure data set was retrieved and screened from the GEO database. A total of 495 differentially expressed genes were screened, of which 165 were up-regulated and 330 were down-regulated. Correlation analysis of differentially expressed genes between coronavirus and heart failure was performed. After cross processing, there were 20 GO entries, which were mainly enriched in virus response, virus defense response, type â interferon response, Î³ interferon regulation, innate immune response regulation, negative regulation of virus life cycle, replication regulation of viral genome, etc. There were 5 KEGG pathways, mainly interacting with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, interleukin (IL)-17 signaling pathway, cytokine and receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, human giant cells viral infection related. All differentially expressed genes were introduced into the STRING online analysis website for protein interaction network analysis, and core genes such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, IL-10, IL17, TNF, interferon regulatory factor 9, 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1, mitogen-activated protein kinase 3, radical s-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2, c-x-c motif chemokine ligand 10, caspase 3 and other genes were screened. The drugs predicted by EpiMed's apparent precision treatment prediction platform for disease-drug association analysis were mainly TNF-&#945; inhibitors, resveratrol, ritonavir, paeony, retinoic acid, forsythia, and houttuynia cordata. Conclusions: The abnormal activation of multiple inflammatory pathways may be the cause of heart failure in patients after coronavirus infection. Resveratrol, ritonavir, retinoic acid, amaranth, forsythia, houttuynia may have therapeutic effects. Future basic and clinical research is warranted to validate present results and hypothesis.","Chen, X M; Cao, F; Zhang, H M; Chen, H R; Zhang, J D; Zhi, P; Li, Z Y; Wang, Y X; Lu, X C",Zhonghua Xin Xue Guan Bing Za Zhi,50,20

However, whether miR-21 plays a role in curcumin-mediated treatment of HCC is unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify the potential functions and mechanisms of miR-21 in curcumin-mediated treatment of HCC. Methods: The anticancer effects of curcumin were assessed in vivo and in vitro. The underlying mechanism of miR-21 in curcumin-mediated treatment of HCC was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), western blot, and Dual-Luciferase Reporter assays. Results: The present study revealed that curcumin suppressed HCC growth in vivo and inhibited HCC cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Meanwhile, the curcumin treatment can downregulate miR-21 expression, upregulate TIMP3 expression, and inhibit the TGF-ß1/smad3 signaling pathway. miR-21 inhibition enhanced the effect of curcumin on cell proliferation inhibition, apoptosis, and TGF-ß1/smad3 signaling pathway inhibition in HepG2 and HCCLM3 cells. It demonstrated that TIMP3 was a direct target gene of miR-21. Interestingly, the effect of miR-21 inhibition on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and TGF-ß1/smad3 signaling pathway in HepG2 and HCCLM3 cells exposed to curcumin was attenuated by TIMP3 silencing. Conclusion: Taken together, the present study suggests that miR-21 is involved in the anticancer activities of curcumin through targeting TIMP3, and the mechanism possibly refers to the inhibition of TGF-ß1/smad3 signaling pathway.","Li, Jingtao; Wei, Hailiang; Liu, Yonggang; Li, Qian; Guo, Hui; Guo, Yingjun; Chang, Zhanjie",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,50,21

However, in sub-Saharan Africa, a low prevalence and mortality have been observed so far. METHODS: We collected data on individuals' social contacts in the South West Shewa Zone (SWSZ) of Ethiopia across geographical contexts characterized by heterogeneous population density, work and travel opportunities, and access to primary care. We assessed how socio-demographic factors and observed mixing patterns can influence the COVID-19 disease burden, by simulating SARS-CoV-2 transmission in remote settlements, rural villages, and urban neighborhoods, under school closure mandate. RESULTS: From national surveillance data, we estimated a net reproduction number of 1.62 (95% CI 1.55-1.70). We found that, at the end of an epidemic mitigated by school closure alone, 10-15% of the population residing in the SWSZ would have been symptomatic and 0.3-0.4% of the population would require mechanical ventilation and/or possibly result in a fatal outcome. Higher infection attack rates are expected in more urbanized areas, but the highest incidence of critical disease is expected in remote subsistence farming settlements. School closure contributed to reduce the reproduction number by 49% and the attack rate of infections by 28-34%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the relatively low burden of COVID-19 in Ethiopia observed so far may depend on social mixing patterns, underlying demography, and the enacted school closures. Our findings highlight that socio-demographic factors can also determine marked heterogeneities across different geographical contexts within the same region, and they contribute to understand why sub-Saharan Africa is experiencing a relatively lower attack rate of severe cases compared to high-income countries.","Trentini, Filippo; Guzzetta, Giorgio; Galli, Margherita; Zardini, Agnese; Manenti, Fabio; Putoto, Giovanni; Marziano, Valentina; Gamshie, Worku Nigussa; Tsegaye, Ademe; Greblo, Alessandro; Melegaro, Alessia; Ajelli, Marco; Merler, Stefano; Poletti, Piero",BMC Med,50,12

Considered essential workers, ABA providers are exempt from government directives to close, so they have both the freedom and the great responsibility to make their own decisions about how best to keep their clients safe while continuing to provide medically necessary services. In the coming weeks and months, ABA providers will be faced with the decision about whether to reopen centers. This article does not address that decision, except to acknowledge the urgency to reopen, both to help clients and to remain solvent. Political rhetoric and contradictory public information further complicate this daunting decision. Because ABA providers do not have legal guidance to shift the burden of such decisions to local and state regulators, the burden is theirs alone. The unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic means that no decision is clearly wrong or right, and every decision has consequences. Although ABA providers do not have their own state guidance, many states have issued guidelines for childcare providers whose operations have continued throughout the pandemic. This article analyzes that guidance, identifies common variables potentially relevant to ABA organizations, highlights clinical considerations and procedural compliance, and provides ABA organizations with the tools to make the best decision for their clients, in their community, and on their timeline.","Kornack, Julie; Williams, Ashley L; Johnson, Katherine A; Mendes, Eileen M",Behav Anal Pract,50,17

The entire scientific community across the globe is working diligently to tackle this unprecedented challenge. In silico studies have played a crucial role in the current situation by expediting the process of identification of novel potential chemotypes targeting the viral receptors. In this study, we have made efforts to identify molecules that can potentially inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) using the high-resolution crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro has a large flexible binding pocket that can accommodate various chemically diverse ligands but a complete occupation of the binding cavity is necessary for efficient inhibition and stability. We augmented glide three-tier molecular docking protocol with water thermodynamics to screen molecules obtained from three different compound libraries. The diverse hits obtained through docking studies were scored against generated WaterMap to enrich the quality of results. Five molecules were selected from each compound library on the basis of scores and protein-ligand complementarity. Further MD simulations on the proposed molecules affirm the stability of these molecules in the complex. MM-GBSA results and intermolecular hydrogen bond analysis also confirm the thermodynamic stability of proposed molecules. This study also presumably steers the structure determination of many ligand-main protease complexes using x-ray diffraction methods. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Thrombin is generated from activation of prothrombin by the prothrombinase (IIase) complex comprising factor Xa, factor Va, and Ca++ ions located on surfaces where these factors are assembled. We discovered that SkM and CM, which are abundant motor proteins in skeletal and cardiac muscles, can provide a surface for thrombin generation by the prothrombinase complex without any apparent requirement for phosphatidylserine or lipids. These myosins can also provide a surface that supports the inactivation of factor Va by activated protein C/protein S, resulting in negative feedback downregulation of thrombin generation. Although the physiologic significance of these reactions remains to be established for humans, substantive insights may be gleaned from murine studies. In mice, exogenously infused SkM and CM can promote hemostasis as they are capable of reducing tail cut bleeding. In a murine myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury model, exogenously infused CM exacerbates myocardial infarction damage. Studies of human plasmas show that SkM antigen isoforms of different MWs circulate in human plasma, and they can be used to identify three plasma SkM phenotypes. A pilot clinical study showed that one SkM isoform pattern appeared to be linked to isolated pulmonary embolism. These discoveries enable multiple preclinical and clinical studies of SkM and CM, which should provide novel mechanistic insights with potential translational relevance for the roles of CM and SkM in the pathobiology of hemostasis and thrombosis.","Deguchi, Hiroshi; Morla, Shravan; Griffin, John H",J. thromb. haemost,50,1

As the global COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, it is also becoming increasingly apparent that the interactions between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus (DM) are complex pathophysiological mechanisms. The outcome of COVID-19 is more severe in people with DM, which has the potential to accelerate the onset of acute metabolic complications of DM such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemia. These mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear, but they likely include the angiotensin converting enzyme receptor 2, a binding site for SARS-CoV-2, which is expressed in key metabolic organs such as in the pancreas, in particular in β-cells. The potential β-cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 can damage cells and impair insulin secretion, causing hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. Understanding the bidirectional interaction between DM and COVID-19 will be critical to protecting and treating people with DM. Current epidemiological data on COVID-19 do not support the hypothesis that diabetic patients are at increased risk of infection compared to the general population. To date, it has been established that decompensated DM is an independent factor that aggravates the course of coronavirus infection and significantly increases the risk of a fatal outcome of the disease. The review provides a brief summary of the evolution of pathogenetic and clinical aspects for understanding the mechanisms of this pathological tandem, as well as therapeutic strategies for treating patients with COVID-19 and DM. As the incidence of DM continues to rise globally, more than ever, diabetes prevention and control must be a priority for health systems around the world.","Tsymbaliuk, V. I.; Tronko, M.

Since then, up to 40% of non-traumatic abdominal emergencies have had unusual delayed treatment. Given the rapidly evolving situation and the absence of evidence to support recommendations during the pandemic, it is useful to assess how the current situation is influencing the management of elderly with acute appendicitis. METHODS: Between February 2020 and December 2020, all patients older than 68 years old undergone appendectomy were included. Surgical approach, hospital stay, post-operative complications, radiology reports, and histologic examination were included in the retrospective analysis and compared with a same sample of the same period before the pandemic. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients underwent appendectomy for acute appendicitis during the pandemic and 34 patients in the pre-outbreak period. Laparoscopic approach was completed in 51.8% of the cases, while conversion to laparotomy in 22.3% of patients and open procedure in the 25.9%, before the pandemic 73.6%, 14.7%, and 11.7%, respectively. During the pandemic, complicated appendicitis occurred in 59.3% of the cases (26.5% before the outbreak). One patient was treated for a pelvic abscess, while no minor complications were detected. No mortality rate was reported, with a mean hospital stay of 5.64 days during the outbreak and 4.21 days before the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Our data highlighted a partial delay in diagnosis in the elderly group, and an increase in complicated appendicitis also demonstrated by the need for conversion to laparotomy.","Lisi, G; Campanelli, M; Mastrangeli, M R; Grande, S; Viarengo, M A; Garbarino, G M; Vanni, G; Grande, M",Int. j. colorectal. dis,50,24

Recently, many countries that suffer from coronavirus crises attempt to access citizen's location data to eliminate the outbreak. However, it raises privacy concerns and may open the doors to more invasive forms of surveillance in the name of public health. It also brings a challenge for privacy protection techniques: how can we leverage people's mobile data to help combat the pandemic without scarifying our location privacy. We demonstrate that we can have the best of the two worlds by implementing policy-based location privacy for epidemic surveillance. Specifically, we formalize the privacy policy using graphs in light of differential privacy, called policy graph. Our system has three primary functions for epidemic surveillance: location monitoring, epidemic analysis, and contact tracing. We provide an interactive tool allowing the attendees to explore and examine the usability of our system: (1) the utility of location monitor and disease transmission model estimation, (2) the procedure of contact tracing in our systems, and (3) the privacy-utility trade-offs w.r.t. different policy graphs.

A major challenge of RNAi therapeutics is the endosomal entrapment of the delivered siRNA. In this study, we developed a family of delivery vehicles called Janus base nanopieces (NPs). They are rod-shaped nanoparticles formed by bundles of Janus base nanotubes (JBNTs) with RNA cargoes incorporated inside via charge interactions. JBNTs are formed by noncovalent interactions of small molecules consisting of a base component mimicking DNA bases and an amino acid side chain. NPs presented many advantages over conventional delivery materials. NPs efficiently entered cells via macropinocytosis similar to lipid nanoparticles while presenting much better endosomal escape ability than lipid nanoparticles; NPs escaped from endosomes via a ""proton sponge"" effect similar to cationic polymers while presenting significant lower cytotoxicity compared to polymers and lipids due to their noncovalent structures and DNA-mimicking chemistry. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we have shown that NPs are promising candidates for antiviral delivery applications, which may be used for conditions such as COVID-19 in the future.","Lee, Jinhyung; Sands, Ian; Zhang, Wuxia; Zhou, Libo; Chen, Yupeng",Proc.

METHODS: Our search was including original articles, reviews, guidelines, letters to the editor, comments on guidelines, and editorials, regarding the male reproductive system. We used the words SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, ""2019 ncov,"" testis, sperm, male factor infertility, fertility treatment, semen, assisted reproductive technology (ART), sexual transmission, and ACE2. RESULTS: Data showed coronavirus affects men more than women because of more expression of 2019 nCoV receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) in testicular cells. Also, ""Bioinformatics Analysis"" suggests that sperm production may be damaged, since ""Pseudo Time Analysis"" has shown disruption in spermatogenesis. ""Gene Ontology"" (GO) showed an increase in viral reproduction and a decrease in sperm production-related terms. Recently, SARS-COV-2 mRNA and protein were detected in the semen of patients that had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, the probable disruption of blood-testis barrier (BTB) in febrile diseases is suspected in the acute phase of the disease enabling viral entry into the testes. Not only is spermatogenesis disturbed, but also disturbs gonadotropin, androgens, and testosterone secretion during SARS-CoV-2 infection. No sexual transmission has been reported yet; however, detection of the virus in semen still makes the sexual transmission an open question. CONCLUSION: There is a concern that male fertility may be disturbed after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, follow-up of the reproductive functions and male fertility may be necessary in recovered cases, especially in aged men.","Moshrefi, Mojgan; Ghasemi-Esmailabad, Saeed; Ali, Jaffar; Findikli, Necati; Mangoli, Esmat; Khalili, Mohammad Ali",J. assist. reprod. genet,50,16

In this study, two AhGPAT9 genes were individually cloned from the A- and B- genomes of peanut, which shared a similarity of 95.65%, with 165 site differences. The overexpression of AhGPAT9 or the knock-down of its gene expression increased or decreased the seed oil content, respectively. Allelic polymorphism analysis was conducted in 171 peanut germplasm, and 118 polymorphic sites in AhGPAT9A formed 64 haplotypes (a1 to a64), while 94 polymorphic sites in AhGPAT9B formed 75 haplotypes (b1 to b75). The haplotype analysis showed that a5, b57, b30 and b35 were elite haplotypes related to high oil content, whereas a7, a14, a48, b51 and b54 were low oil content types. Additionally, haplotype combinations a62/b10, a38/b31 and a43/b36 were associated with high oil content, but a9/b42 was a low oil content haplotype combination. The results will provide valuable clues for breeding new lines with higher seed oil content using hybrid polymerization of high-oil alleles of AhGPAT9A and AhGPAT9B genes.","Lv, Yuying; Zhang, Xiurong; Luo, Lu; Yang, Hui; Li, Pinghua; Zhang, Kun; Liu, Fengzhen; Wan, Yongshan",Sci Rep,50,22

Because of this, it is important to investigate COVID­19 mortality and its predictors in one of the most densely populated regions of the country, Silesia Province. OBJECTIVES: The goals of this study were to assess in­hospital mortality due to COVID­19 and the impact of sex, age, and coexisting diseases on the risk of death. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The data analysis was based on discharge reports of patients with COVID­19 hospitalized between March and June 2020 in all hospitals in the region. Age, sex, hospital discharge status, and the presence of coexisting diseases were abstracted from the charts. RESULTS: In a group of 2830 in­patients with COVID­19, 325 died during hospitalization. COVID­19 deaths were associated with male sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.52; 95% CI, 1.17-1.96), older age (OR, 6.11; 95% CI, 4.5-8.31), and the presence of 3 or more coexisting diseases (OR, 4.78; 95% CI, 3.52-6.49). The most prevalent comorbidities were chronic cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated in­hospital fatality rate for COVID­19 was 11.5%, which is lower than the average COVID­19 fatality rate in other European countries. The risk of in­hospital death was associated with sex, age, and the number of coexisting diseases, such as chronic cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.","Kowalska, Malgorzata; Baranski, Kamil; Brozek, Grzegorz; Kaleta-Pilarska, Angelina; Zejda, Jan E",Pol Arch Intern Med,50,1

There is a marked paucity of articles detailing the CXR findings vis-à-vis a multitude of articles dedicated to the CT features of COVID-19. The purpose of this article is to describe the morphological and distributional patterns of the lung opacities in CXR and to classify the spectrum of essential features on portable AP chest radiographs of PCR-positive COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary care hospital in Scandinavia. To our knowledge, this is the first article to describe the morphological and topographical features of CXRs in COVID-19-positive cases. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of twenty (20) RT-PCR-positive COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital between 12.03.2020 to 10.04.2020 was done in this study. Morphology and distribution of the opacities were reviewed by two senior consultants and analysed for patterns. RESULTS: Most patients had ground-glass opacities (80-85%) and interspersed interstitial opacities (70-75%), often with a characteristic appearance. The opacities were mostly bilateral (80%) and distributed in the lower zones (and to some extent mid zones) and in the middle and peripheral regions, with a tendency to merge towards the hilar areas. There were high interobserver agreements among various parameters and no significant statistical difference between observer 1 and 2. CONCLUSION: Chest radiographics show characteristic patterns and distributions, which can be used as an adjunct in the diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19 patients in specific clinical contexts.","Bharadwaz, Arindam; Langfeldt, Sten",J. med. imaging radiat. oncol.

Since the beginning, SARS-CoV-2 has caused many infections among healthcare workers (HCWs) worldwide. Aims of this study were: a. to compare the distribution among the HCWs and the general population of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Western Sicily and Italy; b. to describe the characteristics of HCWs infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the western Sicilian healthcare context during the first wave of the epidemic diffusion in Italy. Incidence and mean age of HCWs infected with SARS-CoV-2 were comparable in Western Sicily and in the whole Italian country. The 97.6% of infections occurred in HCWs operating in non-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) working environments, while an equal distribution of cases between hospital and primary care services context was documented. Nurses and healthcare assistants, followed by physicians, were the categories more frequently infected by SARS-CoV-2. The present study suggests that healthcare workers are easily infected compared to the general population but that often infection could equally occur in hospital and non-hospital settings. Safety of HCWs in counteracting the COVID-19 pandemic must be strengthened in hospital [adequate provision of personal protective equipment (PPE), optimization of human resources, implementation of closed and independent groups of HCWs, creation of traffic control building and dedicated areas in every healthcare context] and non-hospital settings (influenza vaccination, adequate psychophysical support, including refreshments during working shifts, adequate rest, and family support).","Costantino, Claudio; Cannizzaro, Emanuele; Verso, Maria Gabriella; Tramuto, Fabio; Maida, Carmelo Massimo; Lacca, Guido; Alba, Davide; Cimino, Livia; Conforto, Arianna; Cirrincione, Luigi; Graziano, Giorgio; Palmeri, Sara; Pizzo, Stefano; Restivo, Vincenzo; Casuccio, Alessandra; Vitale, Francesco; Mazzucco, Walter",Front Public Health,50,1

To evaluate the pandemic's impact and required modifications of radiology medical student courses, the authors developed and administered surveys to Alliance of Medical Student Educators in Radiology (AMSER) faculty and enrolled medical students. The surveys requested feedback and insight about respondents' experiences and innovations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anonymous twenty-question and seventeen-question surveys about the pandemic's impact on medical student education were distributed via email to AMSER members and medical students. The surveys consisted of multiple choice, ranking, Likert scale, and open-ended questions. Differences in the Likert score agreement was performed using one-sided Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests. Survey data were collected using SurveyMonkey (San Mateo, California). This study was IRB exempt. RESULTS: The AMSER survey indicated 96% of institutions cancelled medical student courses and 92% resumed with virtual courses, typically general radiology. A total of 64% of faculty enjoyed online teaching, although 82% preferred on-site courses. A total of 62% of students felt an online radiology course was an excellent alternative to an on-site rotation, although 27% disagreed. A total of 69% of students who completed both on-site and online courses preferred the on-site format. Survey-reported innovations and free response comments have been collated as educational resources. CONCLUSION: Faculty were able to adapt radiology courses to the online environment utilizing interactive lectures, self-directed learning, flipped classroom sessions, and virtual readouts, which were effective for student respondents. Hybrid rotations with on-site and online elements may offer the best of both worlds.","Smith, Elana B; Boscak, Alexis; Friedman, Eric M; Frand, Shterna; Deitte, Lori A; Benefield, Thad; Jordan, Sheryl",Acad. radiol,50,20

Compared with adults, children with SARS-CoV-2 infection may have fewer and less severe symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms are commonly reported in children, sometimes as the only manifestation of the disease, and most often manifest as anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, or abdominal pain. Although most children have asymptomatic or mild disease, 10 % of those infected may experience serious or critical disease, or even death. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome is a rare but serious condition recently reported in children with COVID-19. Studies indicate that children with obesity are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19, and inflammation associated with obesity could be one of the factors that worsens COVID-19 symptoms due to an increased inflammatory response involving molecules such as interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein. On the other hand, evidence has been reported of a higher protein expression of ACE2 in the visceral adipose tissue of obese and malnourished humans, and this could be associated with complications and severity of COVID-19. Therefore, regulation of the intake of macronutrients or micronutrients could be used as a strategy to reduce the consequences of COVID-19. Diet in general and bioactive compounds could play an important role in the prevention of the inflammatory cascade. The micronutrients with the most evidence suggesting a role in immune support are vitamins C and D, zinc, and polyphenols.","León-Lara, Ximena; Vargas-Castillo, Ariana; Ávila-Nava, Azalia; Guevara-Cruz, Martha; Serralde Zúñiga, Aurora E; Medina-Vera, Isabel",Nutr. hosp,50,26

Nevertheless, in order to control the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Tokyo 2020 Olympics were postponed for 2021. Given the high contagiousness of the disease and the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Japan, this decision was appropriate and important in order to safeguard athletes and the public. However, it is a major problem for Japan, involving massive financial losses and a lost opportunity for athletes, coaches, and instructors. Summary: Up-to-date epidemiological data is needed on which to base an appropriate decision regarding the Tokyo 2021 Olympics.

In SARS-CoV-2, there was initially strong evidence in favor of convalescent plasma therapy from a large observational study but the evidence from recent randomized controlled trials has been mixed. However, two of those studies provided convalescent plasma therapy on average 8 days after diagnosis despite earlier data proving that the therapy is most effective when given within 3 days of diagnosis. Another more recent randomized controlled trial found evidence in support of convalescent plasma therapy and we believe that it is no coincidence that they administered convalescent plasma therapy within 3 days of symptom onset. We call for more robustly planned randomized controlled studies to further reliably determine the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy against SARS-CoV-2. Progress has been made with developing a vaccine but there is likely to be a substantial lag in widespread administration of the vaccine, especially in poorer countries. We therefore propose that patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection should be considered for early ambulatory administration of high-dose convalescent plasma in order to reduce the burden of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease.","Fisher, David L; Alin, Pavel; Malnick, Stephen",SN Compr Clin Med,50,16

As these measures are exhausted, non-COVID-19 related issues such as those associated with the mental and physical well-being of people under lockdowns became an emerging concern. As these issues are evident, not to mention the economic downturn, governments are currently looking at designing lockdown relaxation efforts by simultaneously considering both public health and economic restart. Without documented experiences to rely on, governments are resorting to trial-and-error approach in creating a lockdown exit strategy while preventing succeeding waves of cases that may overwhelm healthcare facilities. Thus, this work pioneers the use of the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method with intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) sets along with the domain of public health and the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. The DEMATEL handles the intertwined causal relationships among guideline protocols for the relaxation strategy. The intuitionistic fuzzy set theory addresses the vagueness and uncertainty of human judgments in the context of the DEMATEL. A case study of the Philippine government response for the lockdown exit is presented to evaluate the applicability of the proposed method. Findings reveal that compliance of minimum public health standards, limited movement of persons, suspension of physical classes, the prohibition of mass gatherings, non-operation of category IV industries, and non-operation of hotels or similar establishments are the most crucial protocols for such strategy. These findings offer practical insights for the government to allocate resources and impose measures to ensure their implementation, as well as for developing mitigation efforts to cushion their socio-economic impacts. Policy insights and avenues for future works are also discussed.","Ocampo, Lanndon; Yamagishi, Kafferine",Socioecon Plann Sci,50,16

Within the framework, we use weight sharing strategy to significantly improve the search efficiency and finish the search process in 8 hours. We also propose a new objective, namely potential, which is of benefit to improve the search process's robustness.

Previously, the evolution pattern and similarity among the COVID-19 causative organism severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and causative organisms of other similar infections have been determined using a single type of genetic marker in different studies. Herein, the SARS-CoV-2 and related ß coronaviruses Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV, bat coronavirus (BAT-CoV) were comprehensively analyzed using a custom-built pipeline that employed phylogenetic approaches based on multiple types of genetic markers including the whole genome sequences, mutations in nucleotide sequences, mutations in protein sequences, and microsatellites. The whole-genome sequence-based phylogeny revealed that the strains of SARS-CoV-2 are more similar to the BAT-CoV strains. The mutational analysis showed that on average MERS-CoV and BAT-CoV genomes differed at 134.21 and 136.72 sites, respectively, whereas the SARS-CoV genome differed at 26.64 sites from the reference genome of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the microsatellite analysis highlighted a relatively higher number of average microsatellites for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (106.8 and 107, respectively), and a lower number for SARS-CoV and BAT-CoV (95.8 and 98.5, respectively). Collectively, the analysis of multiple genetic markers of selected ß viral genomes revealed that the newly born SARS-COV-2 is closely related to BAT-CoV, whereas, MERS-CoV is more distinct from the SARS-CoV-2 than BAT-CoV and SARS-CoV.","Rehman, Hafiz Abdul; Ramzan, Farheen; Basharat, Zarrin; Shakeel, Muhammad; Khan, Muhammad Usman Ghani; Khan, Ishtiaq Ahmad",J Med Virol,50,3

We conducted phone surveys with 726 randomly selected village informants across seven rural Chinese provinces in February 2020. Four villages (0.55%) reported infections, and none reported deaths. Disease control measures had been universally implemented in all sample villages. About 74% of informants reported that villagers with wage-earning jobs outside the village had stopped working due to workplace closures. A higher percentage of rural individuals could not work due to transportation, housing, and other constraints. Local governments had taken measures to reduce the impact of COVID-19. Although schools in all surveyed villages were closed, 71% of village informants reported that students were attending classes online. Overall, measures to control COVID-19 appear to have been successful in limiting disease transmission in rural communities outside the main epidemic area. Rural Chinese citizens, however, have experienced significant economic consequences from the disease control measures.","Wang, Huan Dill Sarah-Eve Zhou Huan Ma Yue Xue Hao Sylvia Sean Smith Kumi Boswell Matthew Medina Alexis Loyalka Prashant Abby Cody Friesen Dimitris Rose Nathan Guo Yian Rozelle Scott",Agricultural Economics,50,1

However, unlike first-line therapy, to date, very little is known about the outcomes of second-line therapy. Thus, this study assessed the rate of viral re-suppression and attrition to care and their predictors among people living with HIV on second-line therapy. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 642 people living with HIV at Dessie Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from October 2016 to November 2019. A proportional Cox regression model was computed to explore predictors of viral re-suppression (viral load less than 1000 copies/mL) and attrition to care. RESULTS: Out of 642 subjects, 19 (3%), 44 (6.9%), 70 (10.9%), and 509 (79.3%) patients were lost to follow up, died, transferred out, and alive on care, respectively. Similarly, 82.39% (95% CI: 79.24–85.16%) of patients had achieved viral re-suppression, with 96 per 100 person-year rate of re-suppression. Patients who switched timely to second-line therapy were at a higher rate of viral re-suppression than delayed patients [adjusted hazard rate, AHR = 1.43 (95% CI: 1.17–1.74)]. Not having drug substitution history [AHR = 1.25 (95% CI: 1.02–1.52)] was positively associated with viral re-suppression. In contrast, being on anti-TB treatment [AHR = 0.67 (95% CI: 0.49–0.91)] had lower likelihood with viral re-suppression. In the current study, attrition to care was 11% (95% CI: 8.7–13.9%). Ambulatory or bedridden patients were more at risk of attrition to care as compared with workable patients [AHR = 2.61 (95% CI: 1.40–4.87)]. Similarly, being not virally re-suppressed [AHR = 6.87 (95% CI: 3.86–12.23)] and CD4 count ≤450 cells/mm(3) [AHR = 2.61 (95% CI: 1.40–4.87)] were also positively associated with attrition to care. CONCLUSION: A significant number of patients failed to achieve viral re-suppression and attrition from care. Most identified factors related to patient monitoring. Hence, patient-centered intervention should be strengthened, besides treatment switch.","Wedajo, Shambel; Degu, Getu; Deribew, Amare; Ambaw, Fentie",HIV AIDS (Auckl),50,33

However, the full breadth of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission in California is unknown as reported cases only represent a fraction of all infections. METHODS: We conducted a population-based serosurvey, utilizing mailed, home-based SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing along with a demographic and behavioral survey. We weighted data from a random sample to represent the adult California population and estimated period seroprevalence overall and by participant characteristics. Seroprevalence estimates were adjusted for waning antibodies to produce statewide estimates of cumulative incidence, the infection fatality ratio (IFR), and the reported fraction. RESULTS: California’s SARS-CoV-2 weighted seroprevalence during August–December 2020 was 4.6% (95% CI, 2.8%–7.4%). Estimated cumulative incidence as of November 2, 2020, was 8.7% (95% CrI, 6.4%–11.5%), indicating that 2 660 441 adults (95% CrI, 1 959 218–3 532 380) had been infected. The estimated IFR was 0.8% (95% CrI, 0.6%–1.0%), and the estimated percentage of infections reported to the California Department of Public Health was 31%. Disparately high risk for infection was observed among persons of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity and people with no health insurance and who reported working outside the home. CONCLUSIONS: We present the first statewide SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence estimate among adults in California. As of November 2020, ~1 in 3 SARS-CoV-2 infections in California adults had been identified by public health surveillance.

This article describes a study that investigated the pandemic-related work of community-based adult educators in the ethno-culturally diverse Canadian province of British Columbia. Interviews were conducted with 18 educators who were working on the “front lines” of the pandemic, to document their support of low-income and newcomer communities, to understand how these educators responded in terms of pedagogies and strategies, and to map how these pedagogies and practices might be leveraged for more equitable relationships in post-pandemic community-based education. The authors found that the educators developed a range of inventive and dynamic pedagogies oriented to social solidarity and to taking up intersectional oppressions. These “pandemic pedagogies” may contribute to more equitable and inclusive social–technology relationships in a post-pandemic future.","Smythe, Suzanne; Wilbur, Amea; Hunter, Emily",Int Rev Educ,50,16

The programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1)/PD-1 axis is one among the most extensively studied immune-inhibitory checkpoint molecules, which delivers a negative signal for T cell activation by binding to the PD-1 receptor. The general attributes of PD-L1’s immune-suppressive qualities and novel mechanisms on the barrier functions of vascular endothelium to regulate blood vessel-related inflammatory diseases are concisely reviewed. Though targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis has received immense recognition—the Nobel Prize in clinical oncology was awarded in the year 2018 for this discovery—the use of therapeutic modulating strategies for the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway in chronic inflammatory blood vessel diseases is still limited to experimental models. However, studies using clinical specimens that support the role of PD-1 and PD-L1 in patients with underlying atherosclerosis are also detailed. Of note, delicate balances in the expression levels of PD-L1 that are needed to preserve T cell immunity and to curtail acute as well as chronic infections in underlying blood vessel diseases are discussed. A significant link exists between altered lipid and glucose metabolism in different cells and the expression of PD-1/PD-L1 molecules, and its possible implications on vascular inflammation are justified. This review summarizes the most recent insights concerning the role of the PD-L1/PD-1 axis in vascular inflammation and, in addition, provides an overview exploring the novel therapeutic approaches and challenges of manipulating these immune checkpoint proteins, PD-1 and PD-L1, for suppressing blood vessel inflammation.","Veluswamy, Priya; Wacker, Max; Scherner, Maximilian; Wippermann, Jens",Int J Mol Sci,50,26

In rodent and diseased human lungs, tobacco cigarette (TCIG) smoke increases ACE2, but the effect of electronic cigarette vaping (ECIG) is unknown. It is unknown whether nicotine (in both TCIGs and ECIGs) or non-nicotine constituents unique to TCIG smoke increase expression of key proteins in COVID-19 pathogenesis. METHODS: Immune (CD45(+)) cells collected before the pandemic in otherwise healthy young people, including TCIG smokers (n = 9), ECIG vapers (n = 12), or nonsmokers (NS) (n = 12), were studied. Using flow cytometry, expression of key proteins in COVID-19 pathogenesis were compared among these groups. RESULTS: TCIG smokers and ECIG vapers had similar smoking or vaping burdens as indicated by similar plasma cotinine levels. TCIG smokers compared with NS had a significantly increased percentage of cells that were positive for ACE2 (10-fold, p < .001), TMPRSS2 (5-fold, p < .001), and ADAM17 (2.5-fold, p < .001). Additionally, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) consistently showed greater mean ACE2 (2.2-fold, p < .001), TMPRSS2 (1.5-fold, p < .001), furin (1.1-fold, p < .05), and ADAM17 (2-fold, p < .001) in TCIG smokers compared with NS. In ECIG vapers, furin MFI was increased (1.15-fold, p < .05) and TMPRSS2 MFI tended to be increased (1.1-fold, p = .077) compared with NS. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that key instigators of COVID-19 infection are lower in ECIG vapers compared with TCIG smokers is intriguing and warrants additional investigation to determine if switching to ECIGs is an effective harm reduction strategy. However, the trend toward increased proteases in ECIG vapers remains concerning. IMPLICATIONS: (1) This is the first human study to report a marked increase in proteins critical for COVID-19 infection, including ACE2, TMPRSS2, and ADAM17, in immune cells from healthy tobacco cigarette smokers without lung disease compared with e-cigarette vapers and nonsmokers. (2) These findings warrant additional investigation to determine whether switching to electronic cigarettes may be an effective harm reduction strategy in smokers addicted to nicotine who are unable or unwilling to quit. (3) The increase in proteases in electronic cigarette vapers remains concerning.","Kelesidis, Theodoros; Zhang, Yuyan; Tran, Elizabeth; Sosa, Grace; Middlekauff, Holly R",Nicotine Tob Res,50,6

This may cause individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection to test negative according to serological diagnostic tests in the months and years following symptom onset. Methods A multiplex serological assay was developed to measure IgG and IgM antibody responses to four SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) antigens: spike trimeric ectodomain (Stri), its receptor-binding domain (RBD), spike subunit 1 (S1), and spike subunit 2 (S2). Antibody responses were measured in serum samples from patients in French hospitals with RT-qPCR confirmed infection (n = 259), and negative control serum samples collected before the start of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in 2019 (n = 335). The multiplex antibody data was used to train a random forests algorithm for classifying individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. A mathematical model of antibody kinetics informed by prior information from other coronaviruses was used to estimate time-varying antibody responses and assess the potential sensitivity and classification performance of serological diagnostics during the first year following symptom onset. Results IgG antibody responses to one S antigen identified individuals with previous RT-qPCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with 90.3% sensitivity (95% confidence interval (CI); 86.1%, 93.4%) and 99.1% specificity (95% CI; 97.4%, 99.7%). Using a serological signature of IgG to four antigens, it was possible to identify infected individuals with 96.1% sensitivity (95% CI; 93.0%, 97.9%) and 99.1% specificity (95% CI; 97.4%, 99.7%). Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 increase rapidly 1-2 weeks after symptom onset, with antibody responses predicted to peak within 2-4 weeks. Informed by prior data from other coronaviruses, one year following symptom onset antibody responses are predicted to decay by approximately 60% from the peak response. Depending on the selection of sero-positivity cutoff, we estimate that the sensitivity of serological diagnostics may reduce to 56%-97% after six months, and to 49%-93% after one year. Conclusion Serological signatures based on antibody responses to multiple antigens can provide more accurate and robust serological classification of individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Changes in antibody levels over time may cause reductions in the sensitivity of serological diagnostics leading to an underestimation of sero-prevalence. It is essential that data continue to be collected to evaluate this potential risk.","Rosado, J.; Cockram, C.; Merkling, S.

In this study, we aim to look into the most important prioritization principles amongst different groups in the Jordanian population, in order to facilitate the decision-making process for any potential medical crisis. We conducted an online survey that tackled how individuals would deal with three different scenarios of medical scarcity: (1) organ donation, (2) limited hospital beds during an influenza epidemic, and (3) allocation of novel therapeutics for lung cancer. In addition, a free-comment option was included at the end of the survey if respondents wished to contribute further. Seven hundred and fifty-four survey responses were gathered, including 372 males (49.3%), and 382 females (50.7%). Five groups of individuals were represented including religion scholars, physicians, medical students, allied health practitioners, and lay people. Of the five surveyed groups, four found “sickest-first” to be the most important prioritization principle in all three scenarios, and only the physicians group documented a disagreement. In the first scenario, physicians regarded “sickest-first” and “combined-criteria” to be of equal importance. In general, no differences were documented between the examined groups in comparison with lay people in the preference of options in all three scenarios; however, physicians were more likely to choose “combination” in both the second and third scenarios (OR 3.70, 95% CI 1.62–8.44, and 2.62, 95% CI 1.48–4.59; p < 0.01), and were less likely to choose “sickest-first” as the single most important prioritization principle (OR 0.57, CI 0.37–0.88, and 0.57; 95% CI 0.36–0.88; p < 0.01). Out of 100 free comments, 27 (27.0%) thought that the “social-value” of patients should also be considered, adding the 10th potential allocation principle.

In particular, the crisis highlights the need for local communities reliant on rural tourism to enhance their resilience to the risks simultaneously generated by the pandemic and accelerating impacts of climate change. This is important as the effects of these hazards are intertwined and cannot be treated in isolation. We explore community responses and resilience through case study Quebrada Verde, Peru, a small rural community in the Andes Mountains. Specifically, we report on a qualitative examination involving in-depth semi-structured interviews and focus groups with key informants from the community, supplemented by relevant documentary analysis. Drawing on community resilience and social networks perspectives, we find that the community's preparedness to both threats is unbalanced. On one hand, the community eco-tourism system has developed sufficient tools to adapt to the temporary effects of COVID-19 derived from the community's self-organization skills and topophilia. Specifically, the community possesses a cohesive social structure, it has a solid cultural identity rooted in its customs and traditions, and maintains a social humour that enables it to see the positive aspects of adversity. On the other hand, the analysis of the measures towards strengthening the resilience to climate change delivers mixed results. In particular, the relationship that the community has built with other local organizations to successfully prevent and react to climate change is weak. Therefore, stronger efforts towards bridging this gap must be implemented in order to sustain the wider social network of such organizations, of which the community is a part. This would enable further development and implementation of appropriate risk management strategies to counteract climate change, enhancing the community's resilience of its eco-tourism system to this emergent threat. Importantly, this finding might be relevant to other local communities seeking to improve their resilience to COVID-19 and climate change.","Gabriel-Campos, Edwin; Werner-Masters, Katarzyna; Cordova-Buiza, Franklin; Paucar-Caceres, Alberto",Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management,50,1

Also, healthcare professionals are more and more confronted with patients using smartphone-based health applications (apps). This exploratory study aimed at surveying perceptions on such apps in the context of lung health among a cross section of Austrian practitioners involved in pulmonary care. Materials and Methods: The online questionnaire in German assessed socio-demographic characteristics, telehealth readiness as well as opinions on smoke-free and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) apps. We used descriptive statistics to report the finding. Results: We received valid responses from 55 participants (mean age 52.3 years, 69.1% males). Telehealth readiness was medium, indicating existence of certain barriers adversely impacting telehealth use. As for apps targeting smoking cessation and COPD, respondents indicated high relevance for visualization aspects for patients and control/overview features for the treating doctors. Only 40% of participants indicated that they would recommend a COPD app to an older patient. Conclusions: In smoking cessation therapy, doctors commonly adhere to the “5 A’s”: Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, and Arrange.

COVID-19 data from Texas Health and Human Services between March and August 2020 were analysed. COVID-19 incidence rate (cases per 100 000 population) was compared to statewide for selected urban and rural counties. We used joinpoint regression analysis to identify changes in trends of COVID-19 incidence and interrupted time-series analyses for potential impact of state EROP orders on COVID-19 incidence. We found that the incidence rate increased to 145.1% (95% CI 8.4–454.5%) through 4th April, decreased by 15.5% (95% CI −24.4 −5.9%) between 5th April and 30th May, increased by 93.1% (95% CI 60.9–131.8%) between 31st May and 11th July and decreased by 13.2% (95% CI −22.2 −3.2%) after 12 July 2020. The study demonstrates the EROP policies significantly impacted trends in COVID-19 incidence rates and accounted for increases of 129.9 and 164.6 cases per 100 000 populations for the 24- or 17-week model, respectively, along with other county and state reopening ordinances. The incidence rate decreased sharply after 12th July considering the emphasis on a facemask or covering requirement in business and social settings.","Le, Tuan D.; Bosworth, Michele; Ledlow, Gerald; Le, Tony T.; Bell, Jeffrey; Singh, Karan P.",Epidemiol Infect,50,30

In this context, an early and rapid diagnosis of infected patients that do not require expensive equipment or highly trained personnel is crucial in order to reduce the contagious rate. The aim of this study was to evaluate a chromatographic immunoassay's performance for the rapid diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐antigen. METHODS: A cross‐sectional study included 369 adults from Western México with diagnosis or suspicion of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Two samples were collected; a naso‐oropharyngeal was used for a molecular determination of SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA. The molecular analysis was carried out using DeCoV19 Kit Triplex (Genes2life S.A.P.I.) based on the CDC diagnostic panel for N1, N2, and N3 regions. The second sample was retrieved from a nasopharyngeal rub and used for the rapid diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 antigen employing the commercial STANDARD™ Q COVID‐19 Ag Test (SD BIOSENSOR). RESULTS: Overall, in 28.2% of the patients was detected the SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA, and 21.4% were positive for antigen detection. The rapid antigen test showed a sensitivity and specificity of 75.9% and 100%, respectively, with a positive predictive and negative values of 100% and 91%. Symptoms as anosmia presented a high OR for the positive diagnosis for both test, reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), and the rapid antigen test of 8.86 (CI = 4.91–16) and 6.09 (CI = 3.42–10.85), respectively.

Significant changes have had to be made to the way in which non-COVID-19-related care has been delivered. Our objective was to understand, from the perspective of patients with a chronic, life-long condition (congenital heart disease, CHD) and their parents/carers, the impact of COVID-19 on the delivery of care, how changes were communicated and whether healthcare providers should do anything differently in a subsequent wave of COVID-19 infections. DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative study involving a series of asynchronous discussion forums set up and moderated by three patient charities via their Facebook pages. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with CHD and parents/carers of patients with CHD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Qualitative responses to questions posted on the discussion forums. RESULTS: The forums ran over a 6-week period and involved 109 participants. Following thematic analysis, we identified three themes and 10 subthemes related to individual condition-related factors, patient-related factors and health professional/centre factors that may have influenced how patients and parents/carers experienced changes to service delivery as a result of COVID-19. Specifically, respondents reported high levels of disruption to the delivery of care, inconsistent advice and messaging and variable communication from health professionals, with examples of both excellent and very poor experiences of care reported. Uncertainty about follow-up and factors related to the complexity and stability of their condition contributed to anxiety and stress. CONCLUSIONS: The importance of clear, consistent communication cannot be over-estimated. Our findings, while collected in relation to patients with CHD, are not necessarily specific to this population and we believe that they reflect the experiences of many thousands of people with life-long conditions in the UK. Recommendations related to communication, service delivery and support during the pandemic may improve patients’ experience of care and, potentially, their outcomes.","Wray, Jo; Pagel, Christina; Chester, Adrian H; Kennedy, Fiona; Crowe, Sonya",BMJ Open,50,26

Furthermore, we examined VEGF production in FIPV-infected monocytes/macrophages, and we used feline vascular endothelial cells to examine vascular permeability induced by the culture supernatant of FIPV-infected macrophages. In cats with FIP, the production of effusion was related with increasing plasma VEGF levels. In FIPV-infected monocytes/macrophages, the production of VEGF was associated with proliferation of virus. Furthermore, the culture supernatant of FIPV-infected macrophages induced hyperpermeability of feline vascular endothelial cells. It was suggested that vascular permeability factors, including VEGF, produced by FIPV-infected monocytes/macrophages might increase the vascular permeability and the amounts of effusion in cats with FIP.","Takano, Tomomi; Ohyama, Taku; Kokumoto, Aiko; Satoh, Ryoichi; Hohdatsu, Tsutomu",Virus Res,50,1

Cytokine storm appears to be a factor in COVID-19 mortality. Echinacea species have been used historically for immune modulation. A previous rapid review suggested that Echinacea supplementation may decrease the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in cytokine storm. The objective of the present systematic review was to identify all research that has assessed changes in levels of cytokines relevant to cytokine storm in response to administration of Echinacea supplementation. The following databases were searched: Medline (Ovid), AMED (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), EMBASE (Ovid). Title and abstract screening, full text screening, and data extraction were completed in duplicate using a piloted extraction template. Risk of bias assessment was completed. Qualitative analysis was used to assess for trends in cytokine level changes. The search identified 279 unique publications. After full text screening, 105 studies met criteria for inclusion including 13 human studies, 24 animal studies, and 71 in vitro or ex vivo studies. The data suggest that Echinacea supplementation may be associated with a decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and TNF, as well as an increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The risk of bias in the included studies was generally high. While there is currently no substantive research on the therapeutic effects of Echinacea in the management of either cytokine storm or COVID-19, the present evidence related to the herb's impact on cytokine levels suggests that further research may be warranted in the form of a clinical trial involving patients with COVID-19.","Aucoin, Monique; Cardozo, Valentina; McLaren, Meagan D.; Garber, Anna; Remy, Daniella; Baker, Joy; Gratton, Adam; Kala, Mohammed Ali; Monteiro, Sasha; Warder, Cara; Perciballi, Alessandra; Cooley, Kieran",Metabol Open,50,28

This study investigated the public psychosocial and behavioral responses through different time periods of the pandemic, and assessed whether these changes are different in age, gender, and region. Methods: A three-phase survey was conducted through the DaDui Social Q&A Software for COVID-19. A total of 13,214 effective responses of COVID-19 were collected. Statistical analysis was performed based on their basic information and psychosocial responses. Results: The degree of attention, understanding, and cooperation with preventive and control measures of the disease increased and then decreased. The panic level gradually increased with the epidemic process. The degree of satisfaction with management measures and of confidence in defeating COVID-19 increased throughout the survey. Compared with residents in other areas, respondents from the COVID-19 epicenter (Wuhan) reported a higher degree of self-protection during the outbreak and a significantly lower degree of satisfaction with respect to government prevention and control measures during all phases. Shortages of medical supplies and low testing capacity were reported as the biggest shortcoming in the prevention and control strategies during COVID-19, and an abundance of disorderly and inaccurate information from different sources was the primary cause of panic. Conclusions and Relevance: Major public health events elicit psychosocial and behavioral changes that reflect the different phases of the biologic curve. Sufficient medical supplies and improved organization and accurate information during epidemics may reduce panic and improve compliance with requested changes in behavior. We need to recognize this natural phenomenon and our public policy preparedness should attempt to move the social/psychological curve to the left in order to minimize and flatten the biologic curve.","Yang, Huayu; Xian, Xiaomeng; Hu, Jing; Millis, J.

The disease was first identified as a cluster of respiratory illness in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019, and has rapidly spread across the globe to greater than 200 countries. Healthcare providers are at an increased risk for contracting the disease due to occupational exposure and require appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 respirators. The rapid worldwide spread of high numbers of COVID-19 cases has facilitated the need for a substantial supply of PPE that is largely unavailable in many settings, thereby creating critical shortages. Creative solutions for the decontamination and safe reuse of PPE to protect our frontline healthcare personnel are essential. Here, we describe the development of a process that began in late February 2020 for selecting and implementing the use of hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) as viable method to reprocess N95 respirators. Since pre-existing HPV decontamination chambers were not available, we optimized the sterilization process in an operating room after experiencing initial challenges in other environments. Details are provided about the prioritization and implementation of processes for collection and storage, pre-processing, HPV decontamination, and post-processing of filtering facepiece respirators. Important lessons learned from this experience include, developing an adequate reserve of PPE for effective reprocessing and distribution, and identifying a suitable location with optimal environmental controls (i.e. operating room). Collectively, information presented here provides a framework for other institutions considering decontamination procedures for N95 respirators. IMPACT STATEMENT: There is a critical shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) around the globe. This article describes the safe collection, storage, and decontamination of N95 respirators using hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV). This article is unique because it describes the HPV process in an operating room, and is therefore, a deployable method for many healthcare settings. Results presented here offer creative solutions to the current PPE shortage.","Perkins, Douglas J; Villescas, Steven; Wu, Terry H; Muller, Timothy; Bradfute, Steven; Hurwitz, Ivy; Cheng, Qiuying; Wilcox, Hannah; Weiss, Myissa; Bartlett, Chris; Langsjoen, Jens; Seidenberg, Phil",Exp Biol Med (Maywood),50,29

Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED), characterized by severe diarrhoea and vomiting in pigs, is a highly lethal disease caused by porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) and causes substantial losses in the swine industry worldwide. However, currently available commercial drugs have not shown great therapeutic effects. In this study, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay was applied to screen a library containing 1,590 compounds and identified two compounds, 3-(aminocarbonyl)-1-phenylpyridinium and 2,3-dichloronaphthoquinone, that target the 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)) of PEDV. These compounds are of low molecular weight (MW) and greatly inhibited the activity of this enzyme (IC(50) values were obtained in this study). Furthermore, these compounds exhibited antiviral capacity against another member of the CoV family, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). Here, the inhibitory effects of these compounds against CoVs on Vero cells and feline kidney cells were identified (with EC(50) values) and cell viability assays were performed. The results of putative molecular docking models indicate that these compounds, labeled compound 1 and compound 2, contact the conserved active sites (Cys144, Glu165, Gln191) of 3CL(pro) via hydrogen bonds.

METHODS: An online questionnaire was developed according to the Italian validated COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) and addressed to the general population (GP). A similar questionnaire, augmented with CF specific questions, targeted pwCFs. The two web-based surveys were accessible for some weeks during the lockdown mandated by the Italian government. RESULTS: The CF questionnaire was completed by 712 adult pwCFs (422 females), matched for sex and age with a 1/5 ratio to GP questionnaire respondents. Mild or medium distress affected 40.2% of pwCFs and 43.9% of GP controls, severe distress 5.3% of pwCFs and 6.2% of GP controls. The level of psychological distress was not correlated with the degree of pulmonary function impairment. When symptoms of anxiety and depression, and physical manifestations were independently analyzed, the control group featured a 55% higher level of mild-moderate anxiety symptoms. Signs of psychological distress, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and physical manifestations were significantly more frequent in female pwCFs compared to males, similarly to GP. CONCLUSION: Adult pwCFs seem to have equal, and in some domains, lower levels of psychological distress than GP controls. This might be sustained by lifelong experiences in coping with the demands of their chronic disease. These results may orient future psychological interventions.","Ciprandi, Riccardo; Bonati, Maurizio; Campi, Rita; Pescini, Rita; Castellani, Carlo",J Cyst Fibros,50,1

In health care, the goal of geotagging is to gain a better understanding of health-related questions applied to populations. Although there has been a prevalence of geographic information in public health, in order to effectively use and expand geotagging across health care there is a requirement to understand other factors such as the disposition, standardization, data sources, technologies, and limitations. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this document is to serve as a resource for new researchers in the field. This report aims to be comprehensive but easy for beginners to understand and adopt in practice. The optimal geocodes, their sources, and a rationale for use are suggested. Geotagging’s issues and limitations are also discussed. METHODS: A comprehensive review of technical instructions and articles was conducted to evaluate guidelines for geotagging, and online resources were curated to support the implementation of geotagging practices. Summary tables were developed to describe the available geotagging resources (free and for fee) that can be leveraged by researchers and quality improvement personnel to effectively perform geospatial analyses primarily targeting US health care.

The levels of neutralizing antibodies were approximately 5-fold higher in the umbilical cord than in the maternal blood while the level of total antibodies showed only a 2-fold increase. This suggest that the antibodies that crossed the syncytiotrophoblast cell barrier have specific characteristics that correlate to functional neutralizing capacity. Although pregnant and lactating women have been excluded from clinical trials for several reasons including ethical concerns about fetal exposure, accumulating evidence has now revealed that these vaccines are safe and efficient for both the fetus and the woman. Vaccination against COVID-19 in pregnancy is vital to control disease burden and to decrease morbidity in the ante-, peri- and post-natal periods. Inclusion of pregnant women in research programs for the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines should be mandatory to provide this population with the equitable benefits of vaccine research.","Douxfils, Jonathan; Gillot, Constant; De Gottal, Émilie; Vandervinne, Stéphanie; Bayart, Jean-Louis; Dogné, Jean-Michel; Favresse, Julien",Vaccines (Basel),50,16

Emerging data suggest that the ability of patients with hematological malignancies to form an adequate number of antibodies in response to vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 is suboptimal. In this context, we evaluated the ability of 132 patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma and Hodgkin’s Lymphoma to elicit an adequate immune response to the BNT162b2 vaccine. Vaccination with two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine led to lower production of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in these patients compared with healthy controls. Being on active treatment for the underlying disease was an independent prognostic factor for suboptimal antibody response. This finding underlines the need for timely vaccination ideally during a treatment-free period and for continuous vigilance on infection control measures. ABSTRACT: Emerging data suggest suboptimal antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccination in patients with hematological malignancies. We evaluated the humoral response following the BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), and Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL). An FDA-approved, ELISA-based methodology was implemented to evaluate the titers of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 on day 1 of the first vaccine, and afterwards on day 22 and 50. One hundred and thirty-two patients with CLL/lymphomas and 214 healthy matched controls vaccinated during the same period, at the same center were enrolled in the study (NCT04743388). Vaccination with two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine led to lower production of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with CLL/lymphomas compared with controls both on day 22 and on day 50 (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Disease-related immune dysregulation and therapy-related immunosuppression are involved in the low humoral response. Importantly, active treatment with Rituximab, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or chemotherapy was an independent prognostic factor for suboptimal antibody response. Patients with HL showed superior humoral responses to the NHL/CLL subgroups. In conclusion, patients with CLL/lymphomas have low humoral response following COVID-19 vaccination, underlining the need for timely vaccination ideally during a treatment-free period and for continuous vigilance on infection control measures.","Terpos, Evangelos; Gavriatopoulou, Maria; Fotiou, Despina; Giatra, Chara; Asimakopoulos, Ioannis; Dimou, Maria; Sklirou, Aimilia D.; Ntanasis-Stathopoulos, Ioannis; Darmani, Ismini; Briasoulis, Alexandros; Kastritis, Efstathios; Angelopoulou, Maria; Baltadakis, Ioannis; Panayiotidis, Panayiotis; Trougakos, Ioannis P.; Vassilakopoulos, Theodoros P.; Pagoni, Maria; Dimopoulos, Meletios A.",Cancers (Basel),50,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hospital records of four tertiary care centers were reviewed retrospectively. The subjects comprised 188 pregnant patients and 799 non-pregnant women who were admitted to these hospitals. RESULTS: Pregnancy significantly affected the clinical severity of COVID-19 and this effect was more prominent in pregnant women at >20 weeks gestation (p<0.001). Rates of oxygen support (10.1% vs 4.8%; p≤0.001), intensive care unit admission (3.2% vs 0.6%; p=0.009), presence of fever (12.8% vs 4.4%; p<0.001), tachypnea (7.0% vs 2.4%; p=0.003) and tachycardia (16.0% vs 1.9%; p<0.001) were significantly more frequent in pregnant women compared with non-pregnant women. Pregnancy was strongly associated with the need for oxygen support [relative risk (RR), 2.125; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.25-3.60] and admission to the intensive care unit (RR, 5.1; 95% CI: 1.57-16.53) compared with non-pregnant women. Some 14.4% of the pregnant women had co-morbidities. Sixty of the 188 pregnant women (31.9%) delivered during the Severe Acute Respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection, 11 (18.3%) had vaginal deliveries and 49 (81.7%) were by cesarean section. Of these 60 deliveries, 40 (66.7%) were <37 weeks gestation. CONCLUSION: Pregnancy worsens the morbidity of COVID-19 and this effect seems to increase as the pregnancy advances, but not the mortality rate.","Tug, Niyazi; Yassa, Murat; Köle, Emre; Sakin, Önder; Çakır Köle, Merve; Karateke, Ateş; Yiyit, Nurettin; Yavuz, Emre; Birol, Pınar; Budak, Doğuş; Kol, Ömer; Emir, Edip",Turk J Obstet Gynecol,50,24

Masks reduce the expulsion of respiratory aerosols (called source control) and offer some protection to the wearer. However, masks vary greatly in their designs and construction materials, and it is not clear which are most effective. Our study tested 15 reusable cloth masks (which included face masks, neck gaiters, and bandanas), two medical masks, and two N95 filtering facepiece respirators as source control devices for aerosols ≤ 7 μm produced during simulated coughing and exhalation. These measurements were compared with the mask filtration efficiencies, airflow resistances, and fit factors. The source control collection efficiencies for the cloth masks ranged from 17% to 71% for coughing and 35% to 66% for exhalation. The filtration efficiencies of the cloth masks ranged from 1.4% to 98%, while the fit factors were 1.3 to 7.4 on an elastomeric manikin headform and 1.0 to 4.0 on human test subjects. The correlation coefficients between the source control efficacies and the other performance metrics ranged from 0.31 to 0.66 and were significant in all but one case. However, none of the alternative metrics were strong predictors of the source control performance of cloth masks. Our results suggest that a better understanding of the relationships between source control performance and metrics like filtration efficiency, airflow resistance, and fit factor are needed to develop simple methods to estimate the effectiveness of masks as source control devices for respiratory aerosols.","Lindsley, William G.; Blachere, Francoise M.; Beezhold, Donald H.; Law, Brandon F.; Derk, Raymond C.; Hettick, Justin M.; Woodfork, Karen; Goldsmith, William T.; Harris, James R.; Duling, Matthew G.; Boutin, Brenda; Nurkiewicz, Timothy; Noti, John D.",medRxiv,50,5

It is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia with the development of microthrombi caused by inherited or acquired deficiency of the von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease ADAMTS13 and resulting end-organ damage. Most of the cases are the result of acquired deficiency of ADAMTS13, for which the exact etiology is unknown but reported to be related to various autoimmune disorders, infections, and medications. Our case report features of a patient with a history of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, who developed a recurrence of TTP 5 days after his first dose of the mRNA Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine (mRNA-1273 vaccine) in the setting of recent COVID-19. The close temporal association between vaccine administration, recent COVID-19, and relapse of remitted TTP raises concern for an enhanced immune reaction to COVID-19 vaccine in the setting of recent COVID-19 and underlying autoimmune disease. The association is not absolute, but given the novelty of COVID-19 and the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and the relapse timing, it leads us to pose this hypothesis. Vaccine distribution to a larger and more diverse population will allow for an increased rate of adverse event reporting. This case report exemplifies potential safety issues that may be encountered with new vaccine administration in patients with recent COVID-19 and underlying autoimmune disease. There are no specific recommendations for COVID-19 vaccine administration in such patients.","Karabulut, Korin; Andronikashvili, Ana; Kapici, Ahmet Hakki",Case Rep Hematol,50,24

This struggle requires the effective implementation of several measures that are required in medical science. However, the cultural characteristics of each society prevent these measures from being applied in the same way globally. One area in which social scientists have not applied much effort is observing the impact of countries' cultural characteristics in the fight against outbreaks. Therefore, this study aims to determine whether cultural differences among countries have an impact on their fight against outbreaks. This study uses the COVID-19 pandemic’s total cases and selected European countries’ cultural dimension scores as data. Due to the differences in the measurement units of cultural and outbreak variables, a stepwise multiple logarithmic regression analysis is preferred to select the proper regression model. The results have shown that power distance has a significant and negative effect on the increase rate of the total COVID-19 cases per million (IRTCCPM). In addition, the results have demonstrated that both individualism and indulgence have significant and positive effects on IRTCCPM, at the 95 % confidence level. However, the hypotheses concerning the impacts of masculinity, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation on the IRTCCPM are rejected at the α = 0.05 level. In light of the findings of this study, it can be asserted that countries act in harmony with their cultural characteristics in the formal or informal practices of their fight against outbreaks. The contributions of the study can be discussed in academic and practical fields.","Gokmen, Yunus; Baskici, Cigdem; Ercil, Yavuz",Int J Intercult Relat,50,29

While (re)infection after previous COVID-19 illness or following vaccination are known, their impact and the optimal timing of any booster vaccination is currently debated. International evidence about potential underlying immune response differences remains limited and is currently not available in Hungary. Methods We prospectively investigated the magnitude of immune responses to infection or immunisation, their over-time changes and the occurrence of new infections through anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels and the association with selected individual and clinical parameters in two voluntary cohorts of healthcare workers at a public teaching hospital in a real-world longitudinal cohort study in Hungary. In the first cohort, the anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels of 42 health care workers (female: 100%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection were followed-up over 8 months between June 2020 and February 2021. Beyond the change in immune response, associations with age, selected existing chronic conditions, blood type and severity of symptoms were investigated. In the immunised cohort, anti-spike-RBD protein IgG levels of 49 health care workers (female: 73%) with no prior COVID-19 infection were monitored up to 4 months following initial immunisation with BNT162b2 vaccine between December 2020 and April 2021. Statistical analyses included median analysis, linear regression, ANCOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test and Skillings-Mack test for block designs as relevant. Results Within the infected cohort, the median time of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG level reduction below the positive test cut-off was 6 months. First month IgG levels were on average the highest among those in illness severity category 4, but the difference to less severe categories was not statistically significant. Higher age was associated with higher IgG levels. Within the immunised cohort, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike-RBD protein IgG levels increased 25-fold between the first and second immunisations, significantly decreased to 33% of the peak level after 90 days, and had an overall negative tendency with older age and male sex. IgG monitoring revealed 17% (7/42) and 14% (7/49) new infections in the infected and the immunised cohorts, respectively, all symptomless. Discussion Our study is the first to investigate the level, change and associations of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG immune response in infected or immunised healthcare workers in Hungary. It provides further evidence about the significantly declining IgG protection through initial infection beyond 6 months. While immunisation with mRNA vaccination shows a similar pattern of reduction in protection, IgG levels remained within the positive range at 4 months. The observed rate of 15% new, asymptomatic infections and their potential broader impacts call for further investigations. Overall, our findings are confirmative of the effectiveness of vaccination to prevent illness, recent considerations for booster vaccination beyond 6 months, and indicate the potential benefit of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG monitoring for optimisation.","Gervain, J.; Szabo, K.

Our aim was to evaluate how the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and related preventive strategies affected pediatric emergency rooms (ERs) during this period. We performed a retrospective cohort multicenter study, comparing the lockdown period to the corresponding period in 2019. We examined 15 Italian pediatric ERs in terms of visit rates, specific diagnoses (grouped as air communicable diseases and non-air communicable diseases), and triage categories. During the lockdown period, ER admissions decreased by 81% compared to 2019 (52,364 vs. 10,112). All ER specific diagnoses decreased in 2020 and this reduction was significantly higher for air communicable diseases (25,462 vs. 2934, p < 0.001). Considering the triage category, red codes remained similar (1% vs. 1%), yellow codes increased (11.2% vs. 22.3%), and green codes decreased (80.3% vs. 69.5%). We can speculate that social distancing and simple hygiene measures drastically reduced the spread of air communicable diseases. The increase in yellow codes may have been related to a delay in primary care and, consequently, in ER admissions.","Matera, Luigi; Nenna, Raffaella; Rizzo, Valentina; Ardenti Morini, Francesca; Banderali, Giuseppe; Calvani, Mauro; Calvi, Matteo; Cozzi, Giorgio; Fabiani, Elisabetta; Falsaperla, Raffaele; Kantar, Ahmad; Lanari, Marcello; Lubrano, Riccardo; Messini, Beatrice; Niccoli, Antonio Augusto; Scoppi, Pietro; Tipo, Vincenzo; Midulla, Fabio",Int J Environ Res Public Health,50,1

These rDIs elicited SARS-CoV-specific serum IgG antibody and T-cell responses in vaccinated mice following intranasal or subcutaneous administration. Mice that were subcutaneously vaccinated with rDIs expressing S protein with or without other structural proteins induced a high level of serum neutralizing IgG antibodies and demonstrated marked protective immunity against SARS-CoV challenge in the absence of a mucosal IgA response. These results indicate that the potent immune response elicited by subcutaneous injection of rDIs containing S is able to control mucosal infection by SARS-CoV.

Self-collected swabs offer many advantages provided detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses is not compromised. METHODS In a prospective study, patients attending dedicated COVID-19 collection clinics were offered the option to first self-collect (SC) nasal and throat swabs prior to health worker collection (HC). Two different laboratory services participated, with HC at Site 1 collecting nasal and throat swabs and at Site 2 nasopharyngeal (NP) and throat swabs. Samples were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 as well as common respiratory viruses. Concordance of results between methods was assessed using Cohens kappa (κ). RESULTS Of 236 patients sampled by HC and SC, 25 had COVID-19 (24 by HC and 25 by SC) and 63 had other respiratory viruses (56 by HC and 58 by SC). SC was highly concordant with HC (κ = 0.890) for all viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and more concordant than HC to positive results by any method (κ = 0.959 vs 0.933). CONCLUSIONS Self-collection of throat and nasal swabs offers a reliable alternative to health worker collection for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory viruses. High viral load of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the respiratory tract and sensitive molecular methods may explain these findings. Self-collection also provides patients with easier access to testing, reduces the exposure of the community and health workers to those undergoing testing and reduces the requirement for PPE.","Wehrhahn, Michael C; Robson, Jennifer; Brown, Suzanne; Bursle, Evan; Byrne, Shane; New, David; Chong, Smathi; Newcombe, James P; Sivertsen, Terri; Hadlow, Narelle",,50,9

The Mixed Methods Assessment Tool (MMAT) was used to appraise the quality of the studies. RESULTS: Five articles were included for the systematic review. The results showed that the e-health literacy of Chinese older adults was low. Based on the social-ecological model, the influencing factors at the individual level included age, gender, educational attainment, socioeconomic status, physical and psychological conditions, frequency of internet use, and credibility perception of online health resources; at the interpersonal level, the influencing factors included marital status, being the family carer and being taught how to use internet to find health resources; at the social/community level, influencing factors included language barriers and cultural barriers. CONCLUSION: Current e-health literacy among Chinese older adults is low, which is affected by a number of factors.

Having acquaintances infected with or died from COVID-19, worries on re-outbreak of COVID-19, a higher score of OCI-R or lower score of SF-12, and long latency of VTS were independent risk factors of pVT. Conclusion: Our study showed that COVID-19 could have profound mental influences on psychiatric inpatients. It is high time we did some screening in the wards to seek for patients at risk.","Zheng, Yage; Xiao, Ling; Huang, Yonglan; Wang, Qing; Xie, Yinping; Wang, Huiling; Wang, Gaohua",Front Psychiatry,50,30

Early detection of presymptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases supports the timely implementation of effective outbreak control measures but repetitive screening of residents and staff incurs costs and discomfort. Administration of vaccines is key to controlling the pandemic but the robustness and longevity of the antibody response, correlation of neutralising antibodies with commercial antibody assays, and the efficacy of current vaccines for emerging COVID-19 variants require further study. We propose to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in site-specific sewage as an early warning system for COVID-19 in LTCF and to study the immune response of the staff and residents in LTCF to COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study includes two parts: (1) detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in LTCF site-specific sewage samples using a molecular assay followed by notification of Public Health within 24 hours as an early warning system for appropriate outbreak investigation and control measures and cost–benefit analyses of the system and (2) testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among staff and residents in LTCF at various time points before and after COVID-19 vaccination using commercial assays and neutralising antibody testing performed at a reference laboratory. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Alberta Health Research Ethics Board with considerations to minimise risk and discomforts for the participants. Early recognition of a COVID-19 case in an LTCF might prevent further transmission in residents and staff. There was no direct benefit identified to the participants of the immunity study. Anticipated dissemination of information includes a summary report to the immunity study participants, sharing of study data with the scientific community through the Canadian COVID-19 Immunity Task Force, and prompt dissemination of study results in meeting abstracts and manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals.","Lee, Bonita E; Sikora, Christopher; Faulder, Douglas; Risling, Eleanor; Little, Lorie A; Qiu, Yuanyuan; Gao, Tiejun; Bulat, Ross; Craik, Stephen; Hrudey, Steve E; Ohinmaa, Arto; Estabrooks, Carole A; Gingras, Anne-Claude; Charlton, Carmen; Kim, John; Wood, Heidi; Robinson, Alyssia; Kanji, Jamil N; Zelyas, Nathan; O’Brien, Sheila F; Drews, Steven; Pang, Xiao-Li",BMJ Open,50,12

The aim of this study was to evaluate the serum neutralizing activity of three cohorts. METHODS: : BNT162b2-elicited serum (N=103), candidates as hyper-immune plasma donors (N=90) and patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 P.1 variant (N=22) were enrolled. Three strains of SARS-CoV-2 have been tested: 20A.EU1, B.1.1.7 (alpha) and P.1 (gamma). Neutralizing antibodies (NT-Abs) titers against SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated. RESULTS: : B.1.1.7 and P.1 are less efficiently neutralized by convalescent wild-type infected serums if compared to 20A.EU1 strain (mean titer 1.6 and 6.7-fold lower respectively). BNT162b2 vaccine-elicited human sera show an equivalent neutralization potency on the B.1.1.7 but it is significantly lower for the P.1 variant (mean titer 3.3-fold lower). Convalescent P.1 patients are less protected from other SARS-CoV-2 strains with an important reduction of neutralizing antibodies against 20A.EU1 and B.1.1.7, about 12.2 and 10.9-fold, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: : BNT162b2 vaccine confers immunity against all the tested VOCs, while previous SARS-CoV-2 infection may be less protective.","Gidari, Anna; Sabbatini, Samuele; Bastianelli, Sabrina; Pierucci, Sara; Busti, Chiara; Monari, Claudia; Pasqua, Barbara Luciani; Dragoni, Filippo; Schiaroli, Elisabetta; Zazzi, Maurizio; Francisci, Daniela",J Infect,50,4

The outbreak that started from January 22, 2020, in Fujian Province has been controlled as the number of indigenous cases has not increased since March. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in Fujian Province, China. METHODS: In this retrospective, multicenter study, we collected and analyzed the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data of all cases confirmed by nucleic acid tests in five designated hospitals in Fujian Province between January 22 and February 27, 2020. All patients were followed up until discharge. COVID-19 severity was classified as mild, moderate, severe, or critical. RESULTS: Of 199 discharged patients with COVID-19, 105 patients were male, with a median age of 46.3 years, and 17 patients were severe, and 5 patients were critical on admission. Hypertension and diabetes were the most common comorbidities. The symptoms at illness onset were mainly fever (76.4%), cough (60.8%), and myalgia or fatigue (27.6%). A total of 96.5% of patients had abnormal imaging findings on chest computed tomography. Lymphopenia (37.2%) and hypoxemia (13.6%) were observed. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure occurred in 9 patients (4.5%) and 8 patients (4.0%) respectively. One patient died and the others were cured and discharged with the median hospital stay of 19 days. Old age was negatively correlated with lymphocyte count (r = - 0.296, p < 0.001) and oxygenation index (r = - 0.263, p = 0.001). Bivariate regression analysis revealed that old age (≥ 75 years), hypertension, diabetes, and lymphopenia were correlated with the severity of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in Fujian Province were mostly nonsevere cases with mild or moderate symptoms, and had a lower mortality than patients in Wuhan (4.3%-15%). Older age, hypertension, diabetes, and lymphopenia were risk factors for severity of COVID-19.","Wang, Sijiao; Chen, Zhisheng; Lin, Yijian; Lin, Li; Lin, Qunying; Fang, Sufang; Shi, Yonghong; Zhuang, Xibin; Ye, Yuming; Wang, Ting; Zhang, Hongying; Shao, Changzhou",PLoS One,50,5

The susceptibility of different animal species to SARS-CoV-2 is of concern due to the potential for interspecies transmission, and the requirement for pre-clinical animal models to develop effective countermeasures. In the current study, we determined the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to (i) replicate in porcine cell lines, (ii) establish infection in domestic pigs via experimental oral/intranasal/intratracheal inoculation, and (iii) transmit to co-housed naive sentinel pigs. SARS-CoV-2 was able to replicate in two different porcine cell lines with cytopathic effects. Interestingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2-inoculated pigs showed evidence of clinical signs, viral replication or SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses. Moreover, none of the sentinel pigs displayed markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data indicate that although different porcine cell lines are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, five-week old pigs are not susceptible to infection via oral/intranasal/intratracheal challenge. Pigs are therefore unlikely to be significant carriers of SARS-CoV-2 and are not a suitable pre-clinical animal model to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis or efficacy of respective vaccines or therapeutics.","Meekins, David A.; Morozov, Igor; Trujillo, Jessie D.; Gaudreault, Natasha N.; Bold, Dashzeveg; Artiaga, Bianca L.; Indran, Sabarish V.; Kwon, Taeyong; Balaraman, Velmurugan; Madden, Daniel W.; Feldmann, Heinz; Henningson, Jamie; Ma, Wenjun; Balasuriya, Udeni B.

Recently, the Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China required the establishment of the system of ‘High-quality Online and Offline Courses’, which indicates that online courses will play an important role in higher education. Furthermore, the number of pathologists currently cannot satisfy clinical needs. To solve this health issue and implement the policy from the Ministry of Education, it is necessary to improve the current state of pathology education. First, we need to know students’ opinions of the current courses and their professional choices. METHODS: Online questionnaires covering the quality of traditional courses, attitudes towards online courses, and suggestions for optimizing courses were designed and applied. Whether students want to become pathologists and the underlying reasons for this interest are also included in this survey. Participants are medical students from certain colleges in Nanjing. The collected data were assessed by statistical analyses, and p-values less than 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: Of the 342 valid responses, 60.94% of undergraduate students showed their interest in pathology courses, and among them, 48.72% expressed that they may become pathologists. However, the corresponding percentage is only 29.59% in the group without interest. To optimize curricula, the top two suggestions are introducing more clinical cases (undergraduate students, 64.45%; graduate students, 79.09%) and making the classes lively and interesting (undergraduate students, 59.77%; graduate students, 62.79%). Approximately 80.00% of students consider online courses to be good supplementary materials to traditional courses, and approximately half prefer an online-offline mixed learning model. Salary, interest, and employment status are the main factors influencing students’ professional choices. CONCLUSIONS: Students are generally satisfied with traditional pathology courses, and online courses are good supplementary materials in their opinions. It has been suggested that clinical cases be introduced in classes. It is more likely that students who have an interest in pathology will become pathologists. The data from this survey also show that the main causes of the shortage of pathologists are a lack of engaging work and an unsatisfactory salary.","Xu, Chun; Li, Yiping; Chen, Pingsheng; Pan, Min; Bu, Xiaodong",BMC Med Educ,50,9

The continuous increase of MERS cases has posed a serious threat to public health worldwide, calling for development of safe and effective MERS vaccines. We have previously shown that a recombinant protein containing residues 377–588 of MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) fused with human Fc (S377-588-Fc) induced highly potent anti-MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in the presence of MF59 adjuvant. Here we optimized the doses of S377-588-Fc using MF59 as an adjuvant in order to elicit strong immune responses with minimal amount of antigen. Our results showed that S377-588-Fc at 1 μg was able to induce in the immunized mice potent humoral and cellular immune responses. Particularly, S377-588-Fc at 1 μg elicited strong neutralizing antibody responses against both pseudotyped and live MERS-CoV similar to those induced at 5 and 20 μg, respectively. These results suggest that this RBD-based subunit MERS vaccine candidate at the dose as low as one μg is sufficiently potent to induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses, including neutralizing antibodies, against MERS-CoV infection, thus providing guidance for determining the optimal dosage of RBD-based MERS vaccines in the future clinical trials and for applying the dose-sparing strategy in other subunit vaccine trials.","Tang, Jian; Zhang, Naru; Tao, Xinrong; Zhao, Guangyu; Guo, Yan; Tseng, Chien-Te K; Jiang, Shibo; Du, Lanying; Zhou, Yusen",Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics,50,18

Identifying poor prognostic factors is helpful for risk stratification. In this meta-analysis, we investigated the association between severe COVID-19 and a change in white blood cell (WBC) count, an elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP), and fever. Moreover, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of leukocytosis and an elevation of CRP. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library through April 20th, 2020. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. A sensitivity analysis was conducted according to the study size (>200 or <200) and median age (>55 or <55). Meta-regression analyses were conducted to examine possible sources of heterogeneity. We calculated the diagnostic accuracy of leukocytosis and CRP. RESULTS: Eighteen studies with 3278 patients were selected. Fever, leukocytosis, and elevated CRP were associated with poor outcomes (OR (95% CI) 1.63 (1.06–2.51), 4.51 (2.53–8.04), and 11.97 (4.97–28.8), respectively). Leukopenia was associated with a better prognosis (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40–0.78). Sensitivity analyses showed similar tendencies. Meta-regression analysis for leukocytosis indicated that age, dyspnea, and hypertension contributed to heterogeneity. The pooled area under the leukocytosis and CRP curves were 0.70 (0.64–0.76) and 0.89 (0.80–0.99), respectively. CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19, fever, leukocytosis, and an elevated CRP were associated with severe outcomes. Leukocytosis and CRP on arrival may predict poor outcomes.","Yamada, Takayuki; Wakabayashi, Mako; Yamaji, Takahiro; Chopra, Nitin; Mikami, Takahisa; Miyashita, Hirotaka; Miyashita, Satoshi",Clin Chim Acta,50,1

We investigated the role of serum markers measured on admission on severity as assessed at discharge and investigated those which relate to the effect of BMI on severity. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data from 610 COVID‐19 cases hospitalized in the province of Zheijang, China were investigated as risk factors for severe COVID‐19 (assessed by respiratory distress) compared to mild or common forms using logistic regression methods. Biochemical markers were correlated with severity using spearman correlations, and a ROC analysis was used to determine the individual contribution of each of the biochemical markers on severity. We carried out formal mediation analyses to investigate the extent of the effect of body mass index (BMI) on COVID‐19 severity mediated by hypertension, glycemia, Lactose Dehydrogenase (LDH) at the time of hospitalization and C‐Reactive Protein levels (CRP), in units of standard deviations. RESULTS: The individual markers measured on admission contributing most strongly to prediction of COVID‐19 severity as assessed at discharge were LDH, CRP and glucose. The proportion of the effect of BMI on severity of COVID‐19 mediated by CRP, glycemia or hypertension, we find that glucose mediated 79% (p < .0001), LDH mediated 78% (p < .0001), hypertension mediated 66% (p < .0001); however, only 44% (p < .005) was mediated by systemic inflammation (CRP).

To assess the seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in Allegheny County, an urban/suburban county in Western PA, 393 human blood samples collected in Fall 2020 and February 2021 were examined for spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (N) antibodies. All RBD-positive samples were evaluated for virus-specific neutralization activity. Our results showed a seroprevalence of 5.5% by RBD ELISA, 4.5% by N ELISA, and 2.5% for both in Fall 2020, which increased to 24.7% by RBD ELISA, 14.9% by N ELISA, and 12.9% for both in February 2021. Neutralization titer was significantly correlated with RBD titer but not with N titer. Using these two assays, we were able to distinguish infected from vaccinated individuals. In the February cohort, higher median income and white race were associated with serological findings consistent with vaccination. This study demonstrates a 4.5-fold increase in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence from Fall 2020 to February 2021 in Allegheny County, PA, due to increased incidence of both natural disease and vaccination. Future seroprevalence studies will need to include the effect of vaccination on assay results and incorporate non-vaccine antigens in serological assessments.","Xu, Lingqing; Doyle, Joshua; Barbeau, Dominique J.; Le Sage, Valerie; Wells, Alan; Duprex, W.

Here, we report the development of interactive, digital patient-cases (eCases) using Twine, a free IF development platform. Fourteen eCases were developed in collaboration with 11 faculty members and were used in seven different PharmD courses over three semesters. eCase content was developed by faculty members for their respective instructional topics and accessed via Web browsers on students’ personal electronic devices. eCases were received positively by students, with > 90% of students reporting that eCases were easy to use, helped them learn the material at their own pace, and gave them an opportunity to learn from mistakes. Student self-perceived confidence also increased significantly after eCase use. Faculty reported that eCases took more time to develop than conventional cases, but were easier to deliver and provided better student engagement. IF is an accessible media for creating and delivering low-fidelity interactive patient cases that can engage all students in a large class. eCases allow students to apply their knowledge, practice clinical decision-making, and safely learn from their mistakes. eCases are versatile and well suited for both in-person and virtual teaching across a variety of health professions programs to teach clinical decision-making.

Therefore, androgens, particularly testosterone (T), could be suspected as playing a critical role in driving this excess of risk. However, gonadal function in critically ill men is actually unknown, mainly because serum T concentration is not routinely measured in clinical practice, even more in this clinical context. OBJECTIVE: To overview on possible mechanisms by which serum T levels could affect the progression of COVID‐19 in men. METHODS: Authors searched PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Google, and Institutional websites for medical subheading terms and free text words referred to “SARS‐CoV‐2”, “COVID‐19”, “testosterone”, “male hypogonadism”, “gender” “immune system”, “obesity”, “thrombosis” until May 19(th) 2020. RESULTS: T, co‐regulating the expression of angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 in host cells, may facilitate SARS‐CoV‐2 internalization. Instead, low serum T levels may predispose to endothelial dysfunction, thrombosis and defective immune response, leading to both impaired viral clearance and systemic inflammation. Obesity, one of the leading causes of severe prognosis in infected patients, is strictly associated with functional hypogonadism, and may consistently strengthen the aforementioned alterations, ultimately predisposing to serious respiratory and systemic consequences. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: T in comparison to estrogen may predispose men to a widespread COVID‐19 infection. Low serum levels of T, which should be supposed to characterize the hormonal milieu in seriously ill individuals, may predispose men, especially aged men, to poor prognosis or death. Further studies are needed to confirm these pathophysiological assumptions and to promptly identify adequate therapeutic strategies.","Giagulli, Vito Angelo; Guastamacchia, Edoardo; Magrone, Thea; Jirillo, Emilio; Lisco, Giuseppe; De Pergola, Giovanni; Triggiani, Vincenzo",Andrology,50,9

Methods We performed a Google TrendsTM search for “Coronavirus” and compared Relative Search Volumes (RSV) indices to the number of reported COVID-19 cases by the European Center for Disease Control (ECDC) using time-lag correlation analysis. Results Worldwide public interest in Coronavirus reached its first peak end of January when numbers of newly infected patients started to increase exponentially in China. The worldwide Google TrendsTM index reached its peak on the 12th of March 2020 at a time when numbers of infected patients started to increase in Europe and COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. At this time the general interest in China but also the Republic of Korea has already been significantly decreased as compared to end of January. Correlations between RSV indices and number of new COVID-19 cases were observed across all investigated countries with highest correlations observed with a time lag of -11.5 days, i.e. highest interest in coronavirus observed 11.5 days before the peak of newly infected cases. This pattern was very consistent across European countries but also holds true for the US. In Brazil and Australia, highest correlations were observed with a time lag of -7 days. In Egypt the highest correlation is given with a time lag of 0, potentially indicating that in this country, numbers of newly infected patients will increase exponentially within the course of April. Conclusions Public interest indicated by RSV indices can help to monitor the progression of an outbreak such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Public interest is on average highest 11.5 days before the peak of newly infected cases.","Effenberger, Maria; Kronbichler, Andreas; Shin, Jae Il; Mayer, Gert; Tilg, Herbert; Perco, Paul",Int J Infect Dis,50,16

Clinicians often struggle to distinguish these from primary headache disorders whereby there is no underlying structural pathology. Here, the authors describe the advancement in our understanding of vascular headache disorders, their clinical presentation and the developments in neuroimaging that facilitate diagnosis. AREAS COVERED: Here the authors discuss the definition of primary and secondary headache disorders. They review the literature on the presentation, choice of neuroimaging and diagnostic tools that can be used to diagnose specific vascular headaches including Carotid or Vertebral artery dissection, Stroke, Temporal Arteritis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral venous thrombosis, Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction syndrome, Primary angiitis, AV malformation and Genetic vasculopathy. The authors discuss the influence of Covid-19 on the management of patients with headache. EXPERT OPINION: Whilst developments in neuroimaging have been of paramount importance in the diagnosis of vascular headache disorders, there is no substitute for meticulous history taking and examination. Research has aided our understanding of clinical presentation, however further studies are needed as well as increased education of neurologists and acute physicians.","Dorsey, Sophie; Ahmed, Fayyaz",Expert Rev Neurother,50,16

While battling for the disease in China, six Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) recipes have been shown to be remarkably effective for treating patients with COVID-19. The present review discusses principles of TCM in curing infectious disease, and clinical evidence and mechanisms of the 6 most effective TCM recipes used in treating COVID-19 in 92% of all of the confirmed cases in China. Applications of TCM and specific recipes in the treatment of other viral infections, such as those caused by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, influenza A virus (including H1N1 and H7N9), influenza B, dengue virus as well as Ebola virus, are also discussed. Among the 6 TCM recipes, Jinhua Qinggan (JHQG) granules and Lianhua Qingwen (LHQW) capsules are recommended during medical observation; Lung Cleansing and Detoxifying Decoction (LCDD) is recommended for the treatment of both severe and non-severe patients; Xuanfeibaidu (XFBD) granules are recommended for treating moderate cases; while Huashibaidu (HSBD) and Xuebijing (XBJ) have been used in managing severe cases effectively. The common components and the active ingredients of the six TCM recipes have been summarized to reveal most promising drug candidates. The potential molecular mechanisms of the active ingredients in the six TCM recipes that target ACE2, 3CL(pro) and IL-6, revealed by molecular biological studies and/or network pharmacology prediction/molecular docking analysis/visualization analysis, are fully discussed. Therefore, further investigation of these TCM recipes may be of high translational value in revealing novel targeted therapies for COVID-19, potentially via purification and characterization of the active ingredients in the effective TCM recipes.","Huang, Kai; Zhang, Pan; Zhang, Zhenghao; Youn, Ji Youn; Zhang, Hongchun; Cai, Hua Linda",Pharmacol Ther,50,15

A cytokine storm has been recognized as one of the leading causes of death in patients with COVID-19. ALI and ARDS along with multiple organ failure have also been presented as the consequences of acute inflammation and cytokine storm. It has been previously confirmed that SARS-CoV, as another member of the beta-CoV family, activates NLRP3 inflammasome and consequently develops acute inflammation in a variety of ways through having complex interactions with the host immune system using structural and nonstructural proteins. Numerous studies conducted on Tranilast have further demonstrated that the given drug can act as an effective anti-chemotactic factor on controlling inflammation, and thus, it can possibly help the improvement of the acute form of COVID-19 by inhibiting some key inflammation-associated transcription factors such as NF-κB and impeding NLRP3 inflammasome. Several studies have comparably revealed the direct effect of this drug on the prevention of inappropriate tissue’s remodeling; inhibition of neutrophils, IL-5, and eosinophils; repression of inflammatory cell infiltration into inflammation site; restriction of factors involved in acute airway inflammation like IL-33; and suppression of cytokine IL-13, which increase mucosal secretions. Therefore, Tranilast may be considered as a potential treatment for patients with the acute form of COVID-19 along with other drugs.","Saeedi-Boroujeni, Ali; Mahmoudian-Sani, Mohammad-Reza; Nashibi, Roohangiz; Houshmandfar, Sheyda; Tahmaseby Gandomkari, Sima; Khodadadi, Ali",Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology,50,3

No effective prophylactic or post-exposure therapy is currently available. RESULTS: We report, however, that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage. In addition to the well-known functions of chloroquine such as elevations of endosomal pH, the drug appears to interfere with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This may negatively influence the virus-receptor binding and abrogate the infection, with further ramifications by the elevation of vesicular pH, resulting in the inhibition of infection and spread of SARS CoV at clinically admissible concentrations. CONCLUSION: Chloroquine is effective in preventing the spread of SARS CoV in cell culture. Favorable inhibition of virus spread was observed when the cells were either treated with chloroquine prior to or after SARS CoV infection. In addition, the indirect immunofluorescence assay described herein represents a simple and rapid method for screening SARS-CoV antiviral compounds.","Vincent, Martin J; Bergeron, Eric; Benjannet, Suzanne; Erickson, Bobbie R; Rollin, Pierre E; Ksiazek, Thomas G; Seidah, Nabil G; Nichol, Stuart T",Virol J,50,16

We aimed to conduct a nationwide multicenter study to determine the characteristics and the clinical prognostic outcome of critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). Materials and Methods: This is a nationwide cohort retrospective study conducted in twenty Saudi hospitals. Results: An analysis of 1470 critically ill COVID-19 patients demonstrated that the majority of patients were male with a mean age of 55.9 ± 15.1 years. Most of our patients presented with a shortness of breath (SOB) (81.3%), followed by a fever (73.7%) and a cough (65.1%). Diabetes and hypertension were the most common comorbidities in the study (52.4% and 46.0%, respectively). Multiple complications were observed substantially more among non-survivors. The length and frequency of mechanical ventilation use were significantly greater (83%) in the non-survivors compared with the survivors (31%). The mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 6 ± 5. The overall mortality rate of the cohort associated with patients that had diabetes, hypertension and ischemic heart disease was 41.8%. Conclusion: Age; a pre-existing medical history of hypertension, diabetes and ischemic heart disease; smoking cigarettes; a BMI ≥ 29; a long mechanical ventilation and ICU stay; the need of ventilatory support; a high SOFA score; fungal co-infections and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) use were key clinical characteristics that predicted a high mortality in our population.","Al Mutair, Abbas; Elhazmi, Alyaa; Alhumaid, Saad; Ahmad, Gasmelseed Y.; Rabaan, Ali A.; Alghdeer, Mohammed A.; Chagla, Hiba; Tirupathi, Raghavendra; Sharma, Amit; Dhama, Kuldeep; Alsalman, Khulud; Alalawi, Zainab; Aljofan, Ziyad; Al Mutairi, Alya; Alomari, Mohammed; Awad, Mansour; Al-Omari, Awad",Medicina (Kaunas),50,20

It is often unpractical to apply these recommendations to resource-restricted settings. We report on a set of pragmatic recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of patients with COVID-19 and AKI in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). For the prevention of AKI among patients with COVID-19 in LMICs, we recommend using isotonic crystalloid solutions for expansion of intravascular volume, avoiding nephrotoxic medications, and using a conservative fluid management strategy in patients with respiratory failure. For the diagnosis of AKI, we suggest that any patient with COVID-19 presenting with an elevated serum creatinine level without available historical values be considered as having AKI. If serum creatinine testing is not available, we suggest that patients with proteinuria should be considered to have possible AKI. We suggest expansion of the use of point-of-care serum creatinine and salivary urea nitrogen testing in community health settings, as funding and availability allow. For the management of patients with AKI and COVID-19 in LMICS, we recommend judicious use of intravenous fluid resuscitation. For patients requiring dialysis who do not have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), we suggest using peritoneal dialysis (PD) as first choice, where available and feasible. For patients requiring dialysis who do have ARDS, we suggest using hemodialysis, where available and feasible, to optimize fluid removal.

In this study, we predicted 4 T cell epitopes from ESAT-6, Ag85A/B and CFP-10 antigens and constructed an ECANS (epitopes casted in a natural structure) DNA vaccine by inserting the epitope DNA segments separately into the gene backbone of M. tb-derived HSP65 (heat shock protein 65) carrier. The immunogenicity and protective efficacy of pECANS DNA vaccine were assessed in BALB/c mice after intramuscular immunization with 4 doses of 50 μg ECANS DNA and followed by mycobaterial challenge 4 weeks after the last immunization. Compared to plasmid encoding HSP65, pECANS DNA immunization elicited remarkably higher levels of IFN-γ production by both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, which were coupled with higher frequencies of antigen-specific T cells and higher CTL activity. Significantly enhanced levels of Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ and IL-12) and increased serum IgG2a/IgG1 ratio were also noted, indicating a predominant Th1 immune response achieved by pECANS DNA immunization. In the consequence, a better protection against Mycobacterium bovis BCG challenge was achieved which was evidenced by reduced bacterial loads in lungs and spleens and profound attenuation of lung inflammation and injury. Our results suggested that multi-T cell-epitope based ECANS gene vaccine induced T cell response to multiple T cell epitopes and led to enhanced protection against mycobacterial challenge. This strategy might be a useful platform to design multi-T cell epitope-based vaccine against M. tb infection.","Gao, Haifeng; Yue, Yan; Hu, Linkun; Xu, Wei; Xiong, Sidong",Vaccine,50,10

Compressive headaches secondary to PPE use including N95 masks have been reported. We aim to describe subtypes of headache related to PPE use in our hospital in Casablanca and working condition factors associated with it. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study among healthcare workers in frontline at Cheikh khalifa International University Hospital, using an online questionnaire. We collected demographic data, comorbidities and previous headaches history. Data about working conditions during pandemic, type and duration of PPE use were described. We calculated the prevalence of De Novo or an aggravated headache among healthcare workers. We studied correlations between PPE related headaches and working conditions and trends in PPE use during the pandemic. Finally, we described the overall discomfort related to PPE use. Results A total of 155 healthcare workers responded to the questionnaire. The N95 masks were the most used type (95.5%) associated with an eye protection in 61.3%. The overall prevalence of headache related to PPE was 62%. It was experienced De Novo in 32.9%, while it was an aggravation of pre-existing headache in 29%. Working more than 8 hours per shift during the pandemic was correlated to De novo headache (p = 0.008). The profession of doctor and working more than 12 hours per shift were correlated to aggravated headache (p = 0.02, p = 0.023). Healthcare workers experienced moderate discomfort, blurred vision and reduced concentration. They judged their professional performance mildly reduced by the use of PPE. Conclusion The increased use of PPE, especially high filtrating masks during the COVID-19 outbreak is responsible for generating headaches in healthcare workers on frontline either De novo or as an aggravation of pre-existing one. Working conditions have the greater impact on generating these types of headaches more than any pre-existing comorbidity.

METHODS: We extracted data from the medical records of adult patients who were consecutively admitted for suspected COVID-19 infection in Moscow, between April 8 and May 28, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 4261 patients hospitalised for suspected COVID-19, outcomes were available for 3480 patients (median age 56 years (interquartile range 45-66). The commonest comorbidities were hypertension, obesity, chronic cardiac disease and diabetes. Half of the patients (n=1728) had a positive RT-PCR while 1748 were negative on RT-PCR but had clinical symptoms and characteristic CT signs suggestive of COVID-19 infection.No significant differences in frequency of symptoms, laboratory test results and risk factors for in-hospital mortality were found between those exclusively clinically diagnosed or with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR.In a multivariable logistic regression model the following were associated with in-hospital mortality; older age (per 1 year increase) odds ratio [OR] 1.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 - 1.06); male sex (OR 1.71, 1.24 - 2.37); chronic kidney disease (OR 2.99, 1.89 – 4.64); diabetes (OR 2.1, 1.46 - 2.99); chronic cardiac disease (OR 1.78, 1.24 - 2.57) and dementia (OR 2.73, 1.34 – 5.47).

To better understand the epidemiology and relative effects of COVID-19 among hospitalized Hispanic patients, we compared individual and census-tract level characteristics of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 to those diagnosed with influenza, another viral infection with respiratory transmission. We evaluated temporal changes in epidemiology related to a shelter-in-place mandate. METHODS: We evaluated patients hospitalized at Cook County Health, the safety-net health system for the Chicago metropolitan area. Among self-identified hospitalized Hispanic patients, we compared those with influenza (2019–2020 season) to COVID-19 infection during March 16, 2020-May 11, 2020. We used multivariable analysis to identify differences in individual and census-tract level characteristics between the two groups. RESULTS: Relative to non-Hispanic blacks and whites, COVID-19 rapidly increased among Hispanics during promotion of social-distancing policies. Whereas non-Hispanic blacks were more likely to be hospitalized for influenza, Hispanic patients predominated among COVID-19 infections (40% relative increase compared to influenza). In the comparative analysis of influenza and COVID-19, Hispanic patients with COVID-19 were more likely to reside in census tracts with higher proportions of residents with the following characteristics: Hispanic; no high school diploma; non-US citizen; limited English speaking ability; employed in manufacturing or construction; and overcrowding. By multivariable analysis, Hispanic patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to those with influenza were more likely to be male (adjusted OR = 1.8; 95% CI 1.1 to 2.9), obese (aOR = 2.5; 95% CI 1.5 to 4.2), or reside in a census tract with ≥40% of residents without a high-school diploma (aOR = 2.5; 95% CI 1.3 to 4.8). CONCLUSIONS: The rapid and disproportionate increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations among Hispanics after the shelter-in-place mandate indicates that public health strategies were inadequate in protecting this population—in particular, for those residing in neighborhoods with lower levels of educational attainment.","Trick, William E.; Badri, Sheila; Doshi, Kruti; Zhang, Huiyuan; Rezai, Katayoun; Hoffman, Michael J.; Weinstein, Robert A.",PLoS One,50,1

METHODS: We performed cell cultures on 193 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction respiratory samples, positive for SARS-CoV-2, obtained from 189 patients at various times, from clinical diagnosis to follow-up. Eleven samples were obtained from asymptomatic individuals, 91 samples from 91 outpatients with mild forms of COVID-19, and 91 samples from 87 inpatients with severe pneumonia. In these patients, neutralising activity was analysed in 30 paired sera collected after symptom onset >10 days. RESULTS: We detected a cytopathic effect (CPE) in 91 (91/193, 47%) samples. Viral viability was maintained for up to 10 days in the patients with mild COVID-19. In the patients with severe COVID-19, the virus remained viable for up to 32 days after the onset of symptoms. Patients with severe COVID-19 presented infectious virus at a significantly higher rate in the samples with moderate to low viral load (cycle threshold value >26): 32/75 (43%) versus 14/63 (22%) for mild cases (P < 0.01). We observed a positive CPE despite the presence of clear neutralising activity (NT50 >1:1024 in 10% (3/30) of samples. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe COVID-19 might shed viable virus during prolonged periods of up to 4 weeks after symptom onset, even when presenting high cycle threshold values in their respiratory samples and despite having developed high neutralising antibody titres.","Folgueira, Maria Dolores; Luczkowiak, Joanna; Lasala, Fátima; Pérez-Rivilla, Alfredo; Delgado, Rafael",Clin Microbiol Infect,50,16

In a previous study, we investigated the presence of coronaviruses in faecal samples from bats at different locations in Denmark, and made phylogenies based on short, partial ORF1b sequences. In this study, selected samples containing bat coronaviruses from three different bat species were analysed, using a non-targeted approach of next-generation sequencing. From the resulting metagenomics data, we assembled full-genome sequences of seven distinct alphacoronaviruses, three astroviruses, and a polyomavirus, as well as partial genome sequences of rotavirus H and caliciviruses, from the different bat species. Comparisons to published sequences indicate that the bat alphacoronaviruses belong to three different subgenera—i.e., Pedacovirus, Nyctacovirus, and Myotacovirus—that the astroviruses may be new species in the genus Mamastrovirus, and that the polyomavirus could also be a new species, but unassigned to a genus. Furthermore, several viruses of invertebrates—including two Rhopalosiphum padi (aphid) viruses and a Kadipiro virus—present in the faecal material were assembled. Interestingly, this is the first detection in Europe of a Kadipiro virus.","Lazov, Christina M.; Belsham, Graham J.; Bøtner, Anette; Rasmussen, Thomas Bruun",Viruses,50,20

In 2006, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Global Disease Detection [GDD] program began collaborating with China to enhance China’s risk communication capacity to address gaps in the SARS communication response. This article describes tangible improvements in China’s public health emergency risk communication capacity between the SARS and H7N9 outbreaks; documents U.S. CDC GDD cooperative technical assistance during 2006–2017; and shares lessons learnt to benefit other countries and contribute to enhance global health security. METHOD: A questionnaire based on the WHO Joint External Evaluation tool [Risk Communication section] was developed. A key communications official from the China National Health Commission [NHC] completed the questionnaire retrospectively to reflect China’s capacity to manage communication response before, during and after the outbreaks of SARS in 2003, influenza H1N1 in 2009, and influenza H7N9 in 2013. A literature search was also conducted in English and Chinese to further substantiate the results of the questionnaire completed by NHC. RESULTS: China demonstrated significantly improved risk communication capacities of pre-event, during event and post event responses to H7N9 when compared to the SARS response. China NHC improved its response through preparedness, availability of dedicated staff and resources for risk communication, internal clearance mechanisms, standard operating procedures with national response parties external to NHC, rumor management, communication with international agencies and consistent messaging with healthcare and private sectors. Correspondingly, the perceived level of trust that the public had in the NHC following outbreaks rose between the SARS and H7N9 response. CONCLUSION: Risk communication capacities in China have increased during the ten years between the SARS outbreak of 2003 and the H7N9 outbreak of 2013. Long-term risk communication capacity building efforts in bilateral collaborations are uncommon. The U.S. CDC GDD project was one of the first such collaborations worldwide. The lessons learned from this project may benefit lower and middle-income countries as they build their national emergency risk communication capacity.

And, from 2010 to 2019 nonmetropolitan America lost population for the first time in history. Diminished natural increase was a major contributor to this and also accelerated the incidence of natural decrease (more deaths than births), particularly in rural America. Deaths exceeded births in 46 percent of all U.S. counties—a near record high. Nearly 79 percent of these natural decrease counties were nonmetropolitan. This research uses recent data and a multivariate spatial regression model to update our understanding of the growing incidence of natural decrease in both rural and urban America. In light of the mortality increase and likely fertility declines stemming from the Covid‐19 pandemic, these findings have significant implications for future nonmetropolitan demographic trends.","Johnson, Kenneth M.",Rural Sociol,50,21

To research the immunogenicity differences of PEDV G1 and G2 genotype strains and obtain a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb), we inoculated specific-pathogen-free BALB/c mice with a newly emerged strain, PEDV-LNCT2. After immunizations, cells from the spleen of the mice were fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells. Following culturing and subcloning, a strain, 1B9, secreting neutralizing antibody, was obtained. The 1B9 mAb neutralized new variant genotype 2 PEDV strains (LNCT2, LNSY, and Hjms), but it did not neutralize a genotype 1 PEDV strain (CV777), in vitro. Results showed that the epitope recognized by the 1B9 mAb lies in the spike protein, and that it is a conformational epitope. These findings confirm that allelic differences in the PEDV S gene between the G1 and G2 genotype strains led to changes in the S protein and, thus, differences in its immunogenicity.","Liu, Jianbo; Shi, Hongyan; Chen, Jianfei; Zhang, Xin; Ji, Zhaoyang; Yuan, Jing; Shi, Da; Cao, Liyan; Zhu, Xiangdong; Dong, Hui; Wang, Xiaobo; Zhang, Jialin; Feng, Li",Virology,50,1

Compared to the trimeric form of the RBD mRNA vaccine (T-RBD), TF-RBD delivered intramuscularly elicited robust and durable humoral immunity as well as a Th1-biased cellular response. After further challenge with live SARS-CoV-2, immunization with a two-shot low-dose regimen of TF-RBD provided adequate protection in hACE2-transduced mice. In addition, the mRNA template of TF-RBD was easily and quickly engineered into a variant vaccine to address SARS-CoV-2 mutations. The TF-RBD multivalent vaccine produced broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies against Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Beta (B.1.351) variants.

Methods This study describes the multidisciplinary COVID-19 Activity Rehabilitation Program (CARP), established at Mayo Clinic to evaluate and treat post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) patients, and reports the clinical characteristics of the first 100 patients receiving evaluation and management during the timeframe of June 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020. Results The cohort consisted of 100 patients (mean age 45 years, 68% women, BMI 30.2, presenting a mean of 93 days after infection). Common pre-existing conditions were respiratory (23%) and mental health, including depression and/or anxiety (34%.) The majority (75%) had not been hospitalized for COVID-19. Common presenting symptoms ware fatigue (80%), respiratory complaints (59%), and neurologic complaints (59%) followed by subjective cognitive impairment, sleep disturbance, and mental health symptoms. More than one-third of the patients (34%) reported difficulties with performing basic activities of daily living. Only 1 in 3 patients had returned to unrestricted work duty at the time of the analysis. For most patients, laboratory and imaging studies were normal or non-diagnostic despite debilitating symptoms. Most patients required physical therapy, occupational therapy, or brain rehabilitation. Face-to-face and virtual care delivery modalities were feasible. Conclusion Many of the patients did not experience COVID-19-related symptoms that were severe enough to require hospitalization, were younger than 65 years of age, more likely to be female, and most had no pre-existing comorbidities prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Symptoms including mood disorders, fatigue, and perceived cognitive impairment resulted in severe negative impacts on resumption of functional and occupational activities in patients experiencing prolonged effects.","Vanichkachorn, Greg; Newcomb, Richard; Cowl, Clayton T.; Murad, M.

However, because there is no protection against FMD immediately after vaccination, research and development on antiviral agents is being conducted to induce protection until immunological competence is produced. This study tested whether well-known chemicals used as RNA virus treatment agents had inhibitory effects on FMD viruses (FMDVs) and demonstrated that ribavirin showed antiviral effects against FMDV in vitro/in vivo. In addition, it was observed that combining the administration of the antiviral agents orally and complementary therapy with vaccines synergistically enhanced antiviral activity and preserved the survival rate and body weight in the experimental animals. Antiviral agents mixed with an adjuvant were inoculated intramuscularly along with the vaccines, thereby inhibiting virus replication after injection and verifying that it was possible to induce early protection against viral infection prior to immunity being achieved through the vaccine. Finally, pigs treated with antiviral agents and vaccines showed no clinical signs and had low virus excretion. Based on these results, it is expected that this combined approach could be a therapeutic and preventive treatment for early protection against FMD.","Choi, Joo-Hyung; Jeong, Kwiwan; Kim, Su-Mi; Ko, Mi-Kyeong; You, Su-Hwa; Lyoo, Young S.; Kim, Byounghan; Ku, Jin-Mo; Park, Jong-Hyeon",J Vet Sci,50,16

These viral replication organelles (ROs) play a key role in the replicative cycle of important human pathogens like coronaviruses, enteroviruses, or flaviviruses. From their discovery to date, progress in our understanding of viral ROs has closely followed new developments in electron microscopy (EM). This review gives a chronological account of this progress and an introduction to the different EM techniques that enabled it. With an ample repertoire of imaging modalities, EM is nowadays a versatile technique that provides structural and functional information at a wide range of scales. Together with well-established approaches like electron tomography or labeling methods, we examine more recent developments, such as volume scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and in situ cryotomography, which are only beginning to be applied to the study of viral ROs. We also highlight the first cryotomography analyses of viral ROs, which have led to the discovery of macromolecular complexes that may serve as RO channels that control the export of newly-made viral RNA.

Its causes are capillary endothelial cell dysfunction, associated carditis, low oxygenization, and increased sympathetic tone, which all worsen myocardial stiffness and microvascular dysfunction (MD). They lead to severe myocardial dysfunction, arrhythmia, acute congestive heart failure, and a significant rise in death cases. During COVID-19, no specific cardiological treatment is started. As adjuvant therapy, anxiolytics in COVID-19 are widely used, but not in all anxious patients who had been infected with coronavirus. Anxiolytics can be useful to moderate MD and immunosuppressive effect of anxiety. The favorable effects of trimetazidine (TMZ) and Coenzyme Q(10) (CoQ(10)) in the treatment of myocardial ischemia and heart failure had previously been proven, and also their anti-inflammatory effects had been suspected; however, they have not yet been used in COVID-19 cases. TMZ promotes glucose-mediated ATP production, which requires less oxygen, which explains its advantageous cardiac effects. Since it lowers serum and myocardial tissue proinflammatory cytokine levels and inhibits myocardial macrophage infiltration, it was suspected that TMZ might represent a novel therapeutic agent to prevent and treat sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction. CoQ(10) plays an important role in cellular ATP production; however, its concentration is decreased in cardiovascular diseases and in influenza patients. Due to its anti-inflammatory effect, CoQ(10) has been suspected to have a key therapeutic target in influenza infection.

In this study, the possibility of transmission of BVDV from calves simultaneously subjected to acute BVDV and bovine coronavirus (BCV) infection was investigated. Ten calves were inoculated intranasally with BVDV Type 1. Each of the 10 calves was then randomly allocated to one of two groups. In each group there were four additional calves, resulting in five infected and four susceptible calves per group. Virulent BCV was actively introduced in one of the groups by means of a transmitter calf. Two calves, susceptible to both BVDV and BCV, were kept in a separate group, as controls. All ten calves actively inoculated with BVDV became infected as shown by seroconversions, and six of them also shed the virus in nasal secretions. However, none of the other eight calves in the two groups (four in each) seroconverted to this agent. In contrast, it proved impossible to prevent the spread of BCV infection between the experimental groups and consequently all 20 study calves became infected with the virus. Following infection, BCV was detected in nasal secretions and in faeces of the calves and, after three weeks in the study, all had seroconverted to this virus. All calves, including the controls, showed at least one of the following clinical signs during days 3–15 after the trial started: fever (≥40°C), depressed general condition, diarrhoea, and cough. The study showed that BVDV primarily infected cattle, even when co-infected with an enteric and respiratory pathogen, are inefficient transmitters of BVDV. This finding supports the principle of the Scandinavian BVDV control programmes that elimination of BVDV infection from cattle populations can be achieved by identifying and removing persistently infected (PI) animals, i.e. that long-term circulation of the virus without the presence of PI animals is highly unlikely.","Niskanen, R.; Lindberg, A.; Tråvén, M.",The Veterinary Journal,50,5

A broad amount of information related to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic was disseminated by social media in Ethiopia. To date, there is limited evidence on the influence of social media use for COVID-19–related information on COVID-19 preventive practice. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the influence of social media use on the practice of COVID-19 preventive measures in Ethiopia. METHODS: This study used an anonymous Internet-based online cross-sectional survey using Google Forms to collect the data from the respondents from May 15 to June 17, 2020, in Ethiopia. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between social media use as a predictor and COVID-19 preventive practice, after adjusting for socio-demographic and risk perception of COVID-19 variables. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 21. RESULTS: A total of 372 respondents have participated in the study. From 372, a total of 208 (55.9%) respondents in this study were male. Study participants who had good use of social media to get COVID-19–related information were 9.5 times more engaged in COVID-19 preventive practices compared with study participants who had poor use of social media to get COVID-19–related information (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 9.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.70-16.13). Also, study participants who had a high-risk perception of COVID-19 were 2.6 times more engaged in COVID-19 practices compared with study participants who had a low-risk perception of COVID-19 (AOR = 2.63; 95% CI: 1.58-4.38). Study participants who were students at the time of this study were 4 times more likely to show an adequate COVID-19 preventive practice score compared with those who had another occupational status (AOR = 4.07; 95% CI: 1.66-9.98) CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the use of social media networks can have a positive effect on the practice of preventive measures and public safety against COVID-19; high-risk perception contributed to preventive activities against COVID-19. Social networking platforms can be used by public health agencies as an important method to raise public health understanding by disseminating concise messages to targeted audiences.","Sadore, Abinet Arega; Handiso, Demelash Woldeyohannes; Wontamo, Tekle Ejajo; Mekango, Dejene Ermias; Moges, Sisay",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,50,23

Participants: Individuals over age 12 who consent to and have no contraindications to venipuncture were eligible. 6,904 participants (4,202 from slums and 2,702 from non-slums) were tested. Main outcome measures: The primary outcomes were the positive test rate for IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 N-protein by demographic group (age and gender) and location (slums and non-slums). The secondary outcome is seroprevalence at slum and non-slum levels. Sera was tested via chemiluminescence (CLIA) using Abbott Diagnostics ArchitectTM N-protein based test. Seroprevalence was calculated using weights to match the population distribution by age and gender and accounting for imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the test. Results: The positive test rate was 54.1% (95% CI: 52.7 to 55.6) and 16.1% (95% CI: 14.9 to 17.4) in slums and non-slums, respectively, a difference of 38 percentage points (P < 0.001). Accounting for imperfect accuracy of tests (e.g., sensitivity, 0.90; specificity 1.00), seroprevalence was as high as 58.4% (95% CI: 56.8 to 59.9) and 17.3% (95% CI: 16 to 18.7) in slums and non-slums, respectively. Conclusions: The high seroprevalence in slums implies a moderate infection fatality rate. The stark difference in seroprevalence across slums and non-slums has implications for the efficacy of social distancing, the level of herd immunity, and equity. It underlines the importance of geographic specificity and urban structure in modeling SARS-CoV-2.","Malani, Anup; Shah, Daksha; Kang, Gagandeep; Lobo, Gayatri Nair; Shastri, Jayanthi; Mohanan, Manoj; Jain, Rajesh; Agrawal, Sachee Tainwala; Juneja, Sandeep; Imad, Sofia; Kolthur-Seetharam, Ullas",,50,1

Sri Lanka is currently experiencing a cluster epidemic with a specific group of overseas returnees and their contacts. The objective of this study was to develop a mathematical model to predict the epidemic in Sri Lanka incorporating measures taken for social distancing and prevention of social gatherings. Methods: A hybrid model incorporating both exponential and polynomial features was developed and parameters were estimated. The developed model was validated using the datasets of three reference countries. Finally, the model was applied to the Sri Lankan data to simulate the epidemic behaviour. Additional features were incorporated to the model to examine the effects of current control measures. Findings: Sri Lanka will have a peak of 177 COVID-19 active cases at the end of second incubation period from the index case of our projection, if the same trend continues. At 10% risk, we project a peak of 263 COVID-19 active cases at the end of third incubation period, and a peak of 353 at the end of fourth incubation period. Should the risk level reach 20%, the peak will be above 1000 active cases after 90 days. Simulations incorporating control measures predict that, deviation from the control measures currently in place could trigger exponential behaviour of the epidemic. Interpretation: The hybrid model combining exponential and polynomial functions showed promising results to predict COVID-19 epidemic. Projections indicate that any early relaxation of control measures is not advisable. This methodological approach can be replicated in other settings at the initial stages of the epidemic.","Perera, S. N.; Ganegoda, N. C.; Siriwardhana, D. D.; Weerasinghe, M. C.",,50,27

Here we reported a case of sudden lymphoid blast crisis after 67 months of TKI discontinuation and depicted the patient by DNA and RNA sequencing to investigate intrinsic molecular features. The mutations of TGFBR2 and PCNT and the dysregulations of TGF-β and other pathways might accelerate the B cell transformation, which may serve as a blast crisis risk indicator of CML. Single-cell transcriptome data revealed that several clusters of immature B cells and late pro-B cells presented clone evolution during the treatment. After failing multiple lines of TKIs, conditioning chemotherapies and chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) targeting CD19 and CD22 were performed to achieve remission. In conclusion, we report the first case of a CML patient with sudden lymphoid blast crisis after a long treatment-free remission and additional gene abnormalities other than BCR-ABL1 might participate in the progression, which need to be closely monitored, and CAR-T could be a solution to the chemoresistant progression.","Miao, Ya-Ru; Liu, Wen; Zhong, Zhaodong; You, Yong; Tang, Yutong; Li, Weiming; Zhu, Xiaojian; Guo, An-Yuan",Front Oncol,50,6

Respiratory illness is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients with the disease spectrum ranging from asymptomatic subclinical infection, to severe pneumonia progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is growing evidence describing pathophysiological resemblance of SARS-CoV-2 infection with other coronavirus infections such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 receptors play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the virus. Disruption of this receptor leads to cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysfunction, and heart failure. Patients with cardiovascular disease are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and they are more likely to develop severe symptoms. Hypertension, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy and coronary heart disease are amongst major cardiovascular disease comorbidities seen in severe cases of COVID-19. There is growing literature exploring cardiac involvement in SARS-CoV-2. Myocardial injury is one of the important pathogenic features of COVID-19. As a surrogate for myocardial injury, multiple studies have shown increased cardiac biomarkers mainly cardiac troponins I and T in the infected patients especially those with severe disease. Myocarditis is depicted as another cause of morbidity amongst COVID-19 patients. The exact mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 can cause myocardial injury are not clearly understood. The proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury are direct damage to the cardiomyocytes, systemic inflammation, myocardial interstitial fibrosis, interferon mediated immune response, exaggerated cytokine response by Type 1 and 2 helper T cells, in addition to coronary plaque destabilization, and hypoxia.","Babapoor-Farrokhran, Savalan; Gill, Deanna; Walker, Jackson; Rasekhi, Roozbeh Tarighati; Bozorgnia, Behnam; Amanullah, Aman",Life Sci,50,1

Although there is considerable knowledge of the molecular interactions between Env and host cell receptors that lead to successful fusion, the precise way in which HIV-1 receptors redistribute to sites of virus binding at the nanoscale remains unknown. Here, we quantitatively examine changes in the nanoscale organisation of CD4 on the surface of CD4(+) T cells following HIV-1 binding. Using single-molecule super-resolution imaging, we show that CD4 molecules are distributed mostly as either individual molecules or small clusters of up to 4 molecules. Following virus binding, we observe a local 3-to-10-fold increase in cluster diameter and molecule number for virus-associated CD4 clusters. Moreover, a similar but smaller magnitude reorganisation of CD4 was also observed with recombinant gp120. For one of the first times, our results quantify the nanoscale CD4 reorganisation triggered by HIV-1 on host CD4(+) T cells. Our quantitative approach provides a robust methodology for characterising the nanoscale organisation of plasma membrane receptors in general with the potential to link spatial organisation to function.","Yuan, Yue; Jacobs, Caron A.; Llorente Garcia, Isabel; Pereira, Pedro M.; Lawrence, Scott P.; Laine, Romain F.; Marsh, Mark; Henriques, Ricardo",Viruses,50,2

Among the respiratory viruses that can affect the lung and cause ARDS, pandemic viruses head the list, with influenza viruses H5N1 and H1N1 2009 being the most recently identified. However, other viruses can cause severe ARDS. Notably, a novel coronavirus was responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003. Apart from these pandemic viruses, respiratory viruses are rarely responsible for viral pneumonia and ARDS. Other than antiviral drug (mainly oseltamivir) administration and avoidance of corticosteroids, management of ARDS due to these viruses does not differ from that for ARDS caused by other diseases. Among Herpesviridae, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) are the two viruses causing nosocomial viral pneumonia that can evolve into ARDS. HSV is frequently recovered in the respiratory tract of mechanically ventilated patients and can sometimes be responsible for HSV bronchopneumonitis. Although not evaluated for this indication, acyclovir can be a therapeutic option for patients with HSV bronchopneumonitis and ARDS. CMV pneumonia can also occur in mechanically ventilated patients, but is difficult to diagnose because virus recovery does not necessarily mean viral disease. Ganciclovir can be considered for patients with ARDS and histology- or cytology-proven CMV pneumonia.","Luyt, Charles-Édouard; Combes, Alain; Trouillet, Jean-Louis; Nieszkowska, Ania; Chastre, Jean",Presse Med,50,24

This study aimed to determine the association between skeletal muscle depletion and clinical outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: One hundred and sixteen patients with severe COVID-19 who underwent chest computed tomography (CT) scan on admission were included in this multicentre, retrospective study. Paraspinal muscle index (PMI) and radiodensity (PMD) were measured using CT images. The primary composite outcome was the occurrence of critical illness (respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, or intensive care unit admission) or death, and the secondary outcomes were the duration of viral shedding and pulmonary fibrosis in the early rehabilitation phase. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were employed to evaluate the associations. RESULTS: The primary composite outcome occurred in 48 (41.4%) patients, who were older and had lower PMD (both P < 0.05). Higher PMD was associated with reduced risk of critical illness or death in a fully adjusted model overall (OR per SD increment: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.80-0.95; P = 0.002) and in female patients (OR per SD increment: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.56-0.91; P = 0.006), although the effect was not statistically significant in male patients (P = 0.202). Higher PMD (HR per SD increment: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.02-1.14; P = 0.008) was associated with shorter duration of viral shedding among female survivors. However, no significant association was found between PMD and pulmonary fibrosis in the early rehabilitation phase, or between PMI and any outcome in both men and women. CONCLUSION: Higher PMD, a proxy measure of lower muscle fat deposition, was associated with a reduced risk of disease deterioration and decreased likelihood of prolonged viral shedding among female patients with severe COVID-19.","Feng, Zhichao; Zhao, Huafei; Kang, Wendi; Liu, Qin; Wu, Jianzhen; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Ma, Xiaoqian; Wang, Wei; Rong, Pengfei",J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,50,33

As such, there is urgent need to identify predictors of clinical severity in COVID-19 patients. This may be useful for early identification of patients who may require life-saving interventions. In this meta-analysis, we evaluated whether malignancies are associated with a significantly enhanced odds of COVID-19 severity and mortality. METHOD: A systematic search of literature was conducted between November 1, 2019, to May 26th, 2020 on PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) to identify studies reporting data on cancers in patients with or without severe COVID-19 were included. The primary outcome of interest was the association between malignancies and COVID-19 severity, while the secondary outcome was the association between malignancies and COVID-19 mortality. Data were pooled into a meta-analysis to estimate pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for either outcome. RESULTS: A total of 20 studies (n = 4549 patients) were included. Overall, malignancies were found to be associated with significantly increased odds of COVID-19 severity (OR = 2.17; 95% CI 1.47–3.196; p < 0.001) and mortality (OR = 2.39; 95% CI 1.18–4.85; p = 0.016).

CONCLUSION: Malignancies were significantly associated with a 2-fold increase in the odds of developing severe COVID-19 disease, as well as mortality. Larger studies are needed to corroborate these findings. These patients should be closely monitored for any signs of unfavorable disease progression.","Cheruiyot, Isaac; Kipkorir, Vincent; Ngure, Brian; Misiani, Musa; Munguti, Jeremiah",Am J Emerg Med,50,30

Extreme production of many kinds of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines occur in severe COVID-19 that called cytokine storm. Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) present in the cytoplasm in an inactive form and can be stimulated by a vast range of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. Thus, STAT-3 can participate in the induction of inflammatory responses during coronavirus infections. STAT-3 can also suppress anti-virus interferon response and induce unbalanced anti-virus adaptive immune response, through influencing Th17-, Th1-, Treg-, and B cell-mediated functions. Furthermore, STAT-3 can contribute to the M2 macrophage polarization, lung fibrosis and thrombosis. Moreover, STAT-3 may be directly targeted by some virus-derived protein and operate as a pro-viral or anti-viral element in a virus-specific process. Here, the possible contribution of STAT-3 to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 was explained, while providing potential approaches to target this transcription factor in an attempt for COVID-19 treatment.","Jafarzadeh, Abdollah; Nemati, Maryam; Jafarzadeh, Sara",Microb Pathog,50,16

The effects on cellular aging processes are incompletely understood. METHODS: Relative telomere length (RTL) was measured by qPCR in this longitudinal cohort study with blood samples taken at birth and at 2 years of age from 60 children (16 preterm and 44 term). Viral respiratory infections the first year were evaluated. Epigenetic biological DNA methylation (DNAm) age was predicted based on methylation array data in 23 children (11 preterm and 12 term). RTL change/year and DNAm age change/year was compared in preterm and term during the 2 first years of life. RESULTS: Preterm infants had longer telomeres than term born at birth and at 2 years of age, but no difference in telomere attrition rate could be detected. Predicted epigenetic DNAm age was younger in preterm infants, but rate of DNAm aging was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Despite early exposure to risk factors for accelerated cellular aging, children born preterm exhibited preserved telomeres. Stress during the neonatal intensive care period did not reflect accelerated epigenetic DNAm aging. Early-life aging was not explained by preterm birth. IMPACT: Preterm birth is associated with elevated disease risk later in life. Preterm children often suffer from inflammation early in life. Stress-related telomere erosion during neonatal intensive care has been proposed. Inflammation-accelerated biological aging in preterm is unknown. We find no accelerated aging due to prematurity or infections during the first 2 years of life.","Henckel, Ewa; Landfors, Mattias; Haider, Zahra; Kosma, Paraskevi; Hultdin, Magnus; Degerman, Sofie; Bohlin, Kajsa",Pediatr Res,50,24

However, significant differences in hospital conditions, as well as skepticism of doctors about machine learning algorithms, limit their introduction into clinical practice. Our goal was to test and apply the principle of ”patient-like-mine” decision support in rapidly changing conditions of a pandemic. METHODS: In the developed system we implemented a fuzzy search that allows a doctor to compare their medical case with similar cases recorded in their medical center since the beginning of the pandemic. Various distance metrics were tried for obtaining clinically relevant search results. With the use of R programming language, we designed the first version of the system in approximately a week. A set of features for the comparison of the cases was selected with the use of random forest algorithm implemented in Caret. Shiny package was chosen for the design of GUI. RESULTS: The deployed tool allowed doctors to quickly estimate the current conditions of their patients by means of studying the most similar previous cases stored in the local health information system. The extensive testing of the system during the first wave of COVID-19 showed that this approach helps not only to draw a conclusion about the optimal treatment tactics and to train medical staff in real-time but also to optimize patients’ individual testing plans. CONCLUSIONS: This project points to the possibility of rapid prototyping and effective usage of ”patient-like-mine” search systems at the time of a pandemic caused by a poorly known pathogen.","Bakin, Evgeny A.; Stanevich, Oksana V.; Danilenko, Daria M.; Lioznov, Dmitry A.; Kulikov, Alexander N.",Health Inf Sci Syst,50,29

We found that the isolate was better adapted to growth in IECs than in Vero cells, and the titer of the IEC cultures was 10(4.5) TCID(50)/0.1 mL at passage 45. Mutations in the S protein increased with the viral passage and the mutations tended towards attenuation. Viral challenge showed that the survival of IEC-adapted cultures was higher at the 45th passage than at the 5th passage.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the incidence of potentially surgical abdominal emergency in our center during the epidemic of COVID-19. Methods A retrospective study was designed. It included all patients admitted for urgent abdominal pathology with potential surgical treatment in our General and Digestive Surgery Department from February 24, 2020 to April 19, 2020. Results Eighty-nine patients with a mean age of 58.85±22.2 were included. The median time from symptom onset to the Emergency Department (ED) visit was 48 (P25-P75 = 24-96) hours. On arrival at the ED, 18 (20%) patients presented with systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria. Fifty-one (57%) surgical procedures were performed. The rate of post-surgical complications at 30 days was 31% and the mortality rate was 2%. Concerning the same period from 2017 to 2019, the mean number of admissions from the ED to our Department decreased by 14% during the epidemic period. Conclusion There has been a decrease in the number of patients admitted for urgent, potentially surgical, abdominal pathology during the period of the COVID-19 epidemic in our center.","Pérez-Rubio, Álvaro; Sebastián Tomás, Juan Carlos; Navarro-Martínez, Sergio; Gonzálvez Guardiola, Paula; Torrecillas Meroño, Daniel Guillermo; Domingo del Pozo, Carlos",,50,26

Here, we describe the development of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) reverse genetics system for PEDV based on two recent Chinese field isolates, namely CHM2013 and BJ2011C. Phylogenetically, CHM2013 is closely related to the vaccine strain SM98 whereas the isolate BJ2011C belongs to the GIIb group, a cluster that contains many recent pandemic strains. The full-length cDNA clones of the two isolates were constructed into BAC under the control of CMV promoter. The rescued viruses rBJ2011C and rCHM2013 were found to replicate at the kinetics similar to their respective parental viruses in cell culture. When tested in the 2-day-old pig model, rBJ2011C caused severe diarrhea of piglets with extensive damages to the intestinal epithelium, leading to 100% fatality within 48 hours. In contrast, the rCHM2013-inoculated piglets all survived with only very minor tissue damage observed. Thus, we have successfully established a convenient platform for PEDV genome manipulation. This study also represents the first description of a DNA-launched reverse genetics system for the highly virulent PEDV.","Li, Jie; Jin, Zhonghui; Gao, Yueyi; Zhou, Lei; Ge, Xinna; Guo, Xin; Han, Jun; Yang, Hanchun",PLoS One,50,2

In multi-region areas such as Italy, where the contagion peak has been reached, it is crucial to find targeted and coordinated optimal exit and restarting strategies on a regional basis to effectively cope with possible onset of further epidemic waves, while efficiently returning the economic activities to their standard level of intensity. Differently from the related literature, where modeling and controlling the pandemic contagion is typically addressed on a national basis, this paper proposes an optimal control approach that supports governments in defining the most effective strategies to be adopted during post-lockdown mitigation phases in a multi-region scenario. Based on the joint use of a non-linear Model Predictive Control scheme and a modified Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)-based epidemiological model, the approach is aimed at minimizing the cost of the so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions (that is, mitigation strategies), while ensuring that the capacity of the network of regional healthcare systems is not violated. In addition, the proposed approach supports policy makers in taking targeted intervention decisions on different regions by an integrated and structured model, thus both respecting the specific regional health systems characteristics and improving the system-wide performance by avoiding uncoordinated actions of the regions. The methodology is tested on the COVID-19 outbreak data related to the network of Italian regions, showing its effectiveness in properly supporting the definition of effective regional strategies for managing the COVID-19 diffusion.","Carli, Raffaele; Cavone, Graziana; Epicoco, Nicola; Scarabaggio, Paolo; Dotoli, Mariagrazia",Annu Rev Control,50,17

While studies analyzing humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 were available rather early during the pandemic, cellular immunity came into focus of investigations just recently. For the present work, we have adapted a protocol, designed for the detection of rare neoantigen-specific Memory T cells in cancer patients for studying cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. Both, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were detected after 6 days of in vitro expansion using overlapping peptide libraries representing the whole viral protein. The assay readout was an Intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometric analysis detecting four functional markers simultaneously (CD154, TNF, IL-2, IFN-{gamma}). We were able to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in 9 of 9 COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. All patients had reactive T cells against at least one of 12 analyzed viral antigens and all patients had Spike-specific T cells. While some antigens were detected by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, Membrane protein was mainly recognized by CD4+ T cells. Strikingly, we were not able to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in 9 unexposed healthy individuals. We are presenting a highly specific protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells. Our data confirmed the important role of cellular immune responses in understanding SARS-CoV-2 clearance. We showed that Spike is the most immunogenic antigen.

The consolidation of lung parenchyma precipitates the alterations in blood gases in COVID-19 patients that are known to complicate and cause hypoxemic respiratory failure. With SARS-CoV-2 damaging multiple organs in COVID-19, including the central nervous system that regulates the breathing process, it is a daunting task to compute the extent to which the failure of the central regulation of the breathing process contributes to the mortality of COVID-19 affected patients. Emerging data on COVID-19 cases from hospitals and autopsies in the last few months have helped in the understanding of the pathogenesis of respiratory failures in COVID-19. Recent reports have provided overwhelming evidence of the occurrence of acute respiratory failures in COVID-19 due to neurotropism of the brainstem by SARS-CoV-2. In this review, a cascade of events that may follow the alterations in blood gases and possible neurological damage to the respiratory regulation centers in the central nervous system (CNS) in COVID-19 are related to the basic mechanism of respiratory regulation in order to understand the acute respiratory failure reported in this disease. Though a complex metabolic and respiratory dysregulation also occurs with infections caused by SARS-CoV-1 and MERS that are known to contribute toward deaths of the patients in the past, we highlight here the role of systemic dysregulation and the CNS respiratory regulation mechanisms in the causation of mortalities seen in COVID-19. The invasion of the CNS by SARS-CoV-2, as shown recently in areas like the brainstem that control the normal breathing process with nuclei like the pre-Bötzinger complex (pre-BÖTC), may explain why some of the patients with COVID-19, who have been reported to have recovered from pneumonia, could not be weaned from invasive mechanical ventilation and the occurrences of acute respiratory arrests seen in COVID-19. This debate is important for many reasons, one of which is the fact that permanent damage to the medullary respiratory centers by SARS-CoV-2 would not benefit from mechanical ventilators, as is possibly occurring during the management of COVID-19 patients.","Baig, Abdul Mannan",ACS Chem Neurosci,50,1

Herein, we report a microcantilever-based optical detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigenic proteins in just few minutes with high specificity by employing fluidic-atomic force microscopy (f-AFM) mediated nanomechanical deflection method. The corresponding antibodies were first grafted on the gold-coated microcantilever surface pre-functionalized with EDC-NHS chemistry for a suitable antibody-antigen interaction. Rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S1) receptor binding domain (RBD) proteins was first demonstrated at a clinically relevant concentration down to 1 ng mL(-1) (33 pM) by real-time monitoring of nanomechanical signal induced by antibody-antigen interaction. More importantly, we further show high specific detection of antigens with nasopharyngeal swab specimens from patients pre-determined with qRT-PCR. The results take less than 5 minutes (swab to signal ≤ 5 min) and exhibit high selectivity and analytical sensitivity (LoD: 100 copies mL(-1); 0.71 ng mL(-1) of N protein).

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Inpatient units at The Mount Sinai Hospital. PATIENTS: Adults age ≥18 admitted between March 1, 2020 and April 9, 2020 with confirmed COVID-19 infection with at least 28 days follow-up. MEASUREMENTS: We captured baseline demographic, pre-hospitalization antiplatelet medication use, and clinical encounter data for all patients who met inclusion criteria. The primary endpoint was peak score on a 6-point modified ordinal scale (MOS), which is based on World Health Organization blueprint R&S groups, used to grade severity of illness through clinical outcomes of interest. Scores indicate the following: 1 – COVID-19 infection not requiring hospitalization, 2 – requiring hospitalization but not supplemental oxygen, 3 – hospitalization requiring supplemental oxygen, 4 – hospitalization requiring high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), 5 – hospitalization requiring intubation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), 6 – death. Multivariable adjusted partial proportional odds model (PPOM) was performed to examine the association between pre-hospitalization antiplatelet medication use and likelihood of each MOS score. MAIN RESULTS: Of 762 people admitted with COVID-19, 239 (31.4%) used antiplatelet medications pre-hospitalization while 523 (68.6%) did not. Antiplatelet users were older and had more co-morbidities at baseline. Before adjusting for covariates, patients who used antiplatelet medications pre-hospitalization were more likely than non-users to have peak MOS score 6 (death, OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.21 – 2.52), peak MOS score ≥5 (intubation/ECMO or death, OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.00 – 1.98) and peak MOS score ≥4 (HFNC, NIPPV, intubation/ECMO or death, OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.01 – 1.94). On multivariable adjusted PPOM analysis controlling for 13 covariates, there were no longer any significant differences in peak MOS scores between users and non-users. CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for covariates, pre-hospital antiplatelet use was not associated with COVID-19 severity in hospitalized patients.","Pan, Darren; Ip, Ada; Zhan, Serena; Wasserman, Isaac; Snyder, Daniel J.; Agathis, Alexandra Z.; Shamapant, Nikhil; Yang, Jeong Yun; Pai, Akila; Mazumdar, Madhu; Poor, Hooman",Heart Lung,50,16

The focus lies on a particular model, developed in the late 1920s through a collaboration of the former field-epidemiologists and medical officer, Wade Hampton Frost, and the biostatistician and population ecologist Lowell Reed. Other than former approaches to epidemic theory in mathematical formula, the Reed-Frost epidemic theory was materialised in a simple mechanical analogue: a box with coloured marbles and a wooden trough. The article reconstructs how the introduction of this mechanical model has reshaped epidemiological reasoning by shifting the field from purely descriptive to analytical practices. It was not incidental that the history of this model coincided with the foundation of epidemiology as an academic discipline, as it valorised and institutionalised new theoretical contributions to the field. Through its versatility, the model shifted the field’s focus from mono-causal explanations informed by bacteriology, eugenics or sanitary perspectives towards the systematic consideration of epidemics as a set of interdependent and dynamic variables.","Engelmann, Lukas",Hist Philos Life Sci,50,14

CoV strains with different biological and genetic properties with respect to classical CCoV strains have been identified in dogs in the last few years, leading to a full reconsideration of the CoV-induced canine diseases. The genetic evolution of dog CoVs is paradigmatic of how CoVs evolve through accumulation of point mutations, insertions or deletions in the viral genome, that led to the emergence of new genotypes (CCoV type I), biotypes (pantropic CCoV) and host variants (canine respiratory coronavirus). This paper is a review of the current literature on the recent genetic evolution of CCoV and emergence of new CoVs in the dog.

AutoVEM2 is composed of three modules, including call module, analysis module, and plot module, which can be used modularly or as a whole for any virus, as long as the corresponding reference genome is provided. Therefore, it’s much more flexible than AutoVEM. Here, we analyzed three existing viruses by AutoVEM2, including SARS-CoV-2, HBV and HPV-16, to show the functions, effectiveness and flexibility of AutoVEM2. We found that the N501Y locus was almost completely linked to the other 16 loci in SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the UK and Europe. Among the 17 loci, 5 loci were on the S protein and all of the five mutations cause amino acid changes, which may influence the epidemic traits of SARS-CoV-2. And some candidate key mutations of HBV and HPV-16, including T350G of HPV-16 and C659T of HBV, were detected.

The purpose of this paper is to describe the development and implementation of a COVID-19 screening tool for oncology telephone triage. METHODS: An Ambulatory Oncology Clinical Nurse Educator and three faculty members worked on the development of an oncology specific triage tool based on the challenges that oncology nurses were having with the generic COVID triage tool. A thorough search of the published literature, as well as pertinent websites, verified that no screening tool for oncology patients was available. RESULTS: The screening tool met a number of essential criteria: (1) simple and easy to use, (2) included the most common signs and symptoms as knowledge of COVID-19 infection changed, (3) was congruent with the overall screening procedures of the medical center, (4) included questions about risk factors for and environmental exposures related to COVID-19, and (5) assessed patient’s current cancer history and treatment status. Over a period of 3 weeks, the content and specific questions on the tool were modified based on information obtained from a variety of sources and feedback from the triage nurses. CONCLUSION: Within 1 month, the tool was developed and implemented in clinical practice. Oncology clinicians can modify this tool to triage patients as well as to screen patients in a variety of outpatient settings (e.g., chemotherapy infusion units, radiation therapy departments). The tool will require updates and modifications based on available resources and individual health care organizations’ policies and procedures.","Elkin, Emmika; Viele, Carol; Schumacher, Karen; Boberg, Maureen; Cunningham, Mari; Liu, Lauren; Miaskowski, Christine",Support Care Cancer,50,12

There are a few reports of allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a potential treatment for ARDS. In this phase 1 clinical trial, we present the safety, feasibility, and tolerability of the multiple infusions of high dose MSCs, which originated from the placenta and umbilical cord, in critically ill COVID-19-induced ARDS patients. METHODS: A total of 11 patients diagnosed with COVID-19-induced ARDS who were admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of two hospitals enrolled in this study. The patients were critically ill with severe hypoxemia and required mechanical ventilation. The patients received three intravenous infusions (200 × 10(6) cells) every other day for a total of 600 × 10(6) human umbilical cord MSCs (UC-MSCs; 6 cases) or placental MSCs (PL-MSCs; 5 cases). FINDINGS: There were eight men and three women who were 42 to 66 years of age. Of these, six (55%) patients had comorbidities of diabetes, hypertension, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and cardiomyopathy (CMP). There were no serious adverse events reported 24–48 h after the cell infusions. We observed reduced dyspnea and increased SpO2 within 48–96 h after the first infusion in seven patients. Of these seven patients, five were discharged from the ICU within 2–7 days (average: 4 days), one patient who had signs of acute renal and hepatic failure was discharged from the ICU on day 18, and the last patient suddenly developed cardiac arrest on day 7 of the cell infusion. Significant reductions in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α; P < 0.01), IL-8 (P < 0.05), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (P < 0.01) were seen in all six survivors. IL-6 levels decreased in five (P = 0.06) patients and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) levels decreased in four (P = 0.14) patients. Four patients who had signs of multi-organ failure or sepsis died in 5–19 days (average: 10 days) after the first MSC infusion. A low percentage of lymphocytes (< 10%) and leukocytosis were associated with poor outcome (P = 0.02). All six survivors were well with no complaints of dyspnea on day 60 post-infusion. Radiological parameters of the lung computed tomography (CT) scans showed remarkable signs of recovery. INTERPRETATION: We suggest that multiple infusions of high dose allogeneic prenatal MSCs are safe and can rapidly improve respiratory distress and reduce inflammatory biomarkers in some critically ill COVID-19-induced ARDS cases. Patients that develop sepsis or multi-organ failure may not be good candidates for stem cell therapy. Large randomized multicenter clinical trials are needed to discern the exact therapeutic potentials of MSC in COVID-19-induced ARDS.

Although the influenza vaccine is able to achieve serological responses in some allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) recipients, its clinical benefits are still uncertain. METHODS: In this prospective, cross-sectional study, we retrospectively analyzed the effect of inactivated trivalent influenza vaccination on the prevalence of influenza RVI in a consecutive cohort of 136 allo-HSCT adult recipients who developed 161 RVI over 5 flu seasons (from 2013 to 2018). Respiratory viruses in upper– and/or lower–respiratory tract specimens were tested using multiplex polymerase chain reaction panel assays. RESULTS: Overall, we diagnosed 74 episodes (46%) of influenza RVI in 70 allo-HSCT recipients. Influenza RVI occurred in 51% of the non-vaccinated compared to 36% of the vaccinated recipients (P = .036). A multivariate analysis showed that influenza vaccination was associated with a lower prevalence of influenza RVI (odds ratio [OR] 0.39, P = .01). A multivariate risk factor analysis of lower–respiratory tract disease (LRTD) identified 2 conditions associated with the probability of influenza RVI progression: influenza vaccination (OR 0.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.014–1, P = .05) and a high-risk immunodeficiency score (OR 36, 95% CI 2.26–575, P = .011). Influenza vaccination was also associated with a lower likelihood of an influenza-related hospital admission (14% vs 2%, P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that influenza vaccination may have a clinical benefit in allo-HSCT recipients with virologically-confirmed RVI, in terms of a lower influenza RVI prevalence, slower LRTD progression, and lower likelihood of hospital admission.","Piñana, José Luis; Pérez, Ariadna; Montoro, Juan; Giménez, Estela; Gómez, María Dolores; Lorenzo, Ignacio; Madrid, Silvia; González, Eva María; Vinuesa, Víctor; Hernández-Boluda, Juan Carlos; Salavert, Miguel; Sanz, Guillermo; Solano, Carlos; Sanz, Jaime; Navarro, David",Clin Infect Dis,50,28

This study aimed to compare the effect of the measures taken by Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom (UK) governments on the outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic as predicted by a mathematical model. Method: Data on the numbers of cases, deaths and government measures were collected from Saudi Ministry of Health and Public Health England. A prediction of the trend of cases, deaths and days to peak was then modelled using the mathematical technique, Exponential Logistic Growth and Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR) model. The measures taken by the governments and the predicted outcomes were compared to assess effectiveness. Result: We found over three months that 22 fast and extreme measures had been taken in Saudi Arabia compared to eight slow and late measures in the UK. This resulted in a decline in numbers of current infected cases per day and mortality in Saudi Arabia compared to the UK. Based on the SIR model, the predicted number of COVID-19 cases in Saudi as of 31st of March was 2064, while the predicted number of cases was 63012 in the UK. In addition, the pandemic is predicted to peak earlier on the 27th of March in Saudi Arabia compared to the 2nd of May 2020 in the UK. The end of transition phases for Saudi and UK according to the model, were predicted to be on 18th of April and 24th of May, respectively. These numbers relate to early and decisive measures adopted by the Saudi government. Conclusion: We show that early extreme measures, informed by science and guided by experience, helped reduce the spread and related deaths from COVID-19 in Saudi. Actions were taken by Saudi Arabia under the national slogan (We are all responsible) resulted in the observed reduced number of current and predicted cases and deaths compared to the UK approach (keep calm and carry on).","Komies, S.; Aldhahir, A.

Herein, using K18-hACE2 mice, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion and encephalitis is associated with mortality in these mice. Intranasal infection of K18-hACE2 mice with 105 plaque-forming units of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in 100% mortality by day 6 after infection. The highest virus titers in the lungs were observed at day 3 and declined at days 5 and 6 after infection. In contrast, very high levels of infectious virus were uniformly detected in the brains of all the animals at days 5 and 6. Onset of severe disease in infected mice correlated with peak viral levels in the brain. SARS-CoV-2-infected mice exhibited encephalitis hallmarks characterized by production of cytokines and chemokines, leukocyte infiltration, hemorrhage and neuronal cell death. SARS-CoV-2 was also found to productively infect cells within the nasal turbinate, eye and olfactory bulb, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 entry into the brain by this route after intranasal infection. Our data indicate that direct infection of CNS cells together with the induced inflammatory response in the brain resulted in the severe disease observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice.","Kumari, Pratima; Rothan, Hussin A.; Natekar, Janhavi P.; Stone, Shannon; Pathak, Heather; Strate, Philip G.; Arora, Komal; Brinton, Margo A.; Kumar, Mukesh",bioRxiv,50,1

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of anxiety, depression and stress related to COVID‐19 pandemic on disease activity of HAE patients during the quarantine period (QP) and the return to normal period (RTNP). METHODS: This study was conducted between March 2020 and September 2020 in four allergy centres. Demographic, clinical features and mental health status were evaluated in QP (from March to the beginning of June) and RTNP (from June to the beginning of September) applied by the government. The 10‐point visual analogue scale (VAS10) was used to define the severity of HAE attacks. Depression‐Anxiety‐ Stress Scale‐21 (DASS‐21) and Fear of COVID‐19 (FC‐19) scales were performed to assess mental health status. RESULTS: 139 HAE patients were included in the study. In QP, median attack numbers and median VAS10 scores were 5 (min‐max: 0‐45) and 6 (min‐max: 0‐10), respectively. HAE attack numbers, DASS‐21 stress, anxiety, depression and total DASS‐21 scores, as well as FC‐19 scores were higher in QP than RTNP (p=0.001, p<0.001, p=0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, respectively). However, there was no difference in attack severity scores between the two periods (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that the restriction measures during COVID‐19 outbreak causes an increase in the number of HAE attacks in relation to anxiety, depression, stress and fear of COVID‐19 pandemic.

There are no studies in Latin America on illegitimate tasks, so the purpose of this research is to translate and validate the Bern Illegitimate Tasks Scale. The study was performed with a sample of nursing staff from a hospital in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Written informed consent was obtained from each of the participants. The reliability of the questionnaire was evaluated and its structural validity was verified by exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. The internal consistency of the whole scale, measured by Cronbach’s alpha, was 0.857. Moreover, the unnecessary and unreasonable subscales measure were 0.846 and 0.841, respectively. The exploratory factor analysis supported a two-factor model that explained 73.96% of the variance. Additionally, the confirmatory factor analysis showed good indexes of fit (GFI = 0.915, CFI = 0.955, TLI = 0.933, SRMR = 0.084, and RMSEA = 0.087).

The system was tested by transient co-transfection of 293T cells, which demonstrated good correlation with standard spike pseudotyping for inhibition by sera and biologics. Then established stable cell lines were very well behaved and gave even better correlation with pseudotyping results, after a short, overnight co-incubation.

Objectives To determine the association between biologics or systemic corticosteroids use with PCR positivity for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 outcomes among asthmatic patients Methods We used the computerized database of Clalit Health Services, the largest healthcare provider in Israel, to identify all asthmatic adult patients who underwent PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2, between 1st of March 2020 and 7th December 2020. A cohort approach was used to assess the association between biologics use and steroids treatment and COVID-19 severity and 90-day mortality. Results Overall, 8,242 out of 80,602 tested asthmatics had positive PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. Both biologics and systemic corticosteroids were not associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariate analyses revealed that biologics were not associated with a significant increased risk of moderate-severe COVID-19, nor with the composite endpoint of moderate-severe COVID-19 or all-cause mortality within 90 days. Chronic systemic corticosteroids use was associated with significant increased risk of all tested outcome. Recent (within the prior 120 days) systemic corticosteroids use, but not former use, was significantly associated with increased risk of both moderate-severe COVID-19 and the composite of moderate-severe COVID-19 or all-cause mortality. Conclusion Biologics approved for asthma and systemic corticosteroids are not associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. By contrast, systemic corticosteroids are independent risk factor for worst COVID-19 severity and all-cause mortality. Our findings underscore the risk of recent or current exposure to systemic corticosteroids in asthmatics infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Adir, Yochai; Humbert, Marc; Saliba, Walid",J Allergy Clin Immunol,50,7

Unfortunately, people commonly use these platforms to share misinformation which can influence other people adversely. The spread of misinformation is unavoidable in an extraordinary situation like Covid-19, and the consequences can be dreadful. This paper proposes a two-step ranking-based misinformation detection (RMiD) technique. Firstly, a novel ranking-based approach leveraging the scalable information retrieval infrastructure is applied to detect misinformation from a huge collection of unlabelled tweets based on a related but very small labelled misinformation data set. Secondly, the identified misinformation tweets are represented as a coupled matrix tensor model and Nonnegative Coupled Matrix Tensor Factorization is applied to learn their spatio-temporal topic dynamics. The experimental analysis shows that RMiD is capable of detecting misinformation with better coverage and less noise in comparison with existing techniques. Moreover, the coupled matrix tensor representation has improved the quality of topics discovered from unlabelled data up to 4% by leveraging the semantic similarity of terms in labelled data.

So far, there is limited clinical evidence on the effect of corticosteroid therapy for this disease. This study aims to investigate the association between corticosteroid therapy and the duration of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) clearance among patients with mild COVID-19. METHODS: Patients with mild COVID-19 were enrolled from two medical centers in China between January 13, 2020 and February 29, 2020. Baseline characteristics and durations of RNA clearance were compared between the corticosteroid and non-corticosteroid therapy groups. The independent effects of corticosteroid therapy on the duration of RNA clearance were estimated by generalized linear models. RESULTS: Of 82 patients with a mild infection, 40 patients were male (48.8%), with a median age of 49 years (interquartile range, IQR 36–61). Among those patients, 36 patients (43.9%) received corticosteroid therapy. The adjusted multivariate models showed that the effects of corticosteroids were non-significant on the durations of onset to first RNA clearance [β 2.48, 95% CI (95% confidence interval) − 0.42 to 5.38, P = 0.0926] and to persistent RNA clearance (β 1.54, 95% CI − 1.41 to 4.48, P = 0.3016), and durations of therapy to first RNA clearance (β 2.16, 95% CI − 0.56 to 4.89, P = 0.1184) and to persistent RNA clearance (β 1.22, 95% CI − 1.52 to 3.95, P = 0.3787). CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroid therapy in patients with mild COVID-19 was not associated with the duration of SARS-CoV-2 clearance, suggesting that the use of corticosteroids may not be beneficial for patients with mild COVID-19 and should be prudently recommended in clinical practice. However, further studies are needed to verify the findings.

This Commentary is a contribution to the Frontiers Research Topic on social disparities in aging, and aims to draw attention to the novel connections that link social disparities, the biological capital of individuals, and policy strategies. The biological capital (as defined in the paper), accrued since conception by individuals, in turn affects their social, cultural, and economic capitals, and thus creates a positive feedback loop. In a large network funded by the European Commission, Lifepath, we have shown that the determinants of health inequalities start in early life and cumulate throughout the life-course. For example, exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) influences the likelihood of later in life health effects, including poor aging. In this paper I compare two types of evidence that have recently emerged from the literature. One addresses the role of early vs. late exposures to risk factors for aging and mortality, including ACEs, using e.g., microsimulation models. The second type of evidence, provided in a recent document of the WHO European Regional Office, is based on the analysis of five broad determinants of health inequalities and eight different macroeconomic policies to tackle such inequalities. Six of the policies, if enacted, have the potential to reduce inequalities in the short term by increasing public expenditure on housing and community amenities, increasing expenditure on labor market policies, reducing income inequality, increasing social protection expenditure, reducing unemployment, and/or reducing out-of-pocket payments for health. Both of these lines of evidence suggest that there are ample opportunities for policy interventions. I also discuss the need for analytical methods to bridge the two types of analyses (biomedical and macroeconomic), i.e., fill the gap between analyses based on individual determinants of health inequalities and those based on societal determinants, to help create more effective policy-making. Also, I propose that before launching large projects to reduce health inequalities, well-designed experiments must be conducted to test their efficacy. These experiments, though, are challenging when addressing social policies, in consideration of ethical constraints and timescales.","Vineis, Paolo",Front Public Health,50,20

An informative portion of the genome (3.4 kb at the 3′ end) was generated for four NoV strains. In the capsid protein VP1 region, strains 63.15/2015/ITA and FD53/2007/ITA were genetically related to the canine GVI.2 strain C33/Viseu/2007/PRT (97.4–98.6% nt and 90.3–98.6% aa). Strain FD210/2007/ITA displayed the highest identity to the GVI.1 canine strain Bari/91/2007/ITA (88.0% nt and 95.0% aa). Strain 5010/2009/ITA displayed only 66.6–67.6% nt and 75.5–81.6% aa identities to the GVI.1 canine strains FD210/2007/ITA and Bari/91/2007/ITA and the GVI feline strain M49-1/2012/JPN. Identity to the other canine/feline NoVs strains in the VP1 was lower than 67.6% nt and 62.7% aa. Based on the full-length VP1 amino acid sequence and the criteria proposed for distinction of NoV genotypes, the canine NoV 5010/2009/ITA could represent the prototype of a third GVI genotype, thus providing further evidence for the genetic heterogeneity of NoVs in carnivores.","Bodnar, Livia; Lorusso, Eleonora; Di Martino, Barbara; Catella, Cristiana; Lanave, Gianvito; Elia, Gabriella; Bányai, Krisztián; Buonavoglia, Canio; Martella, Vito",Infect Genet Evol,50,33

METHODS: In this study, we designed a dynamic graph model, not for precisely predicting the number of infected cases, but for a glance of the dynamics under a public epidemic emergency situation and of different contributing factors. RESULTS: We demonstrated the impact of asymptomatic transmission in this outbreak and showed the effectiveness of city lockdown to halt virus spread within a city. We further illustrated that sudden emergence of a large number of cases could overwhelm the city medical system, and external medical aids are critical to not only containing the further spread of the virus but also reducing fatality. CONCLUSION: Our model simulation showed that highly populated modern cities are particularly vulnerable and lessons learned in China could facilitate other countries to plan the proactive and decisive actions. We shall pay close attention to the asymptomatic transmission being suggested by rapidly accumulating evidence as dramatic changes in quarantine protocol are required to contain SARS-CoV-2 from spreading globally.

These sensors would continually monitor the manhole’s wastewater, and whenever virus remnants are detected, transmit an alert signal. In a recent paper, we described two new algorithms, each sequentially opening and testing successive manholes for genetic remnants, each algorithm homing in on a neighborhood where the infected person or persons are located. This paper extends that work in six important ways: (1) we introduce the concept of in-manhole sensors, as these sensors will reduce the number of manholes requiring on-site testing; (2) we present a realistic tree network depicting the topology of the sewer pipeline network; (3) for simulations, we present a method to create random tree networks exhibiting key attributes of a given community; (4) using the simulations, we empirically demonstrate that the mean and median number of manholes to be opened in a search follows a well-known logarithmic function; (5) we develop procedures for determining the number of sensors to deploy; (6) we formulate the sensor location problem as an integer nonlinear optimization and develop heuristics to solve it. Our sensor-manhole system, to be implemented, would require at least three additional steps in R&D: (a) an accurate, inexpensive and fast SARS-Cov-2 genetic-remnants test that can be done at the manhole; (b) design, test and manufacture of the sensors; (c) in-the-field testing and fine tuning of an implemented system.","Nourinejad, Mehdi; Berman, Oded; Larson, Richard C.",PLoS One,50,1

Viral testing was performed in 11% (2,722/24,567) of hospital admissions and was not associated with reduced odds for death (odds ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.76–1.10) or longer length of stay (+1 day for those tested). Viral testing resulted in more resource utilization, including intensive care unit admission, but positive test results were not associated with less antibiotic use or shorter duration of isolation. Results suggest that health care providers do not use viral test results in making management decisions at this hospital.

Therefore, stem cell therapy for the treatment of complex perianal fistula can be an innovative option with potential long-term healing. AIM: To evaluate the results of local administration of allogenic, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (darvadstrocel) for complex anal Crohn’s fistula. METHODS: All patients with complex anal fistulas associated with Crohn’s disease who were amenable for definite fistula closure within a defined observation period were potential candidates for stem cell injection (darvadstrocel) if at least one conventional or surgical attempt to close the fistula had failed. Darvadstrocel was only indicated in patients without active Crohn’s disease and without presence of anorectal abscess. Local injection of darvadstrocel was performed as a standardized procedure under general anesthesia including single-shot antibiotic prophylaxis, removal of seton drainage, fistula curettage, closure of the internal openings and local stem cell injection. Data collection focusing on healing rates, occurrence of abscess and follow-up was performed on a regular basis of quality control and patient care. Data were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Between July 2018 and January 2021, 12 patients (6 females, 6 males) with a mean age of 42.5 (range: 26-61) years underwent stem cell therapy. All patients had a minimum of one complex fistula, including patients with two complex fistulas in 58.3% (7/12). Two of the 12 patients had horse-shoe fistula and 3 had one complex fistula. According to Parks classification, the majority of fistulas were transsphincteric (76%) or suprasphincteric (14%). All patients underwent removal of seton, fistula curettage, transanal closure of internal opening by suture (11/12) or mucosal flap (1/12) and stem cell injection. At a mean follow-up of 14.3 (range: 3-30) mo, a healing rate was documented in 66.7% (8/12); mean duration to achieve healing was 12 (range: 6-30) wk. Within follow-up, 4 patients required reoperation due to perianal abscess (33.3%). Focusing on patients with a minimum follow-up of 12 mo (6/12) or 24 mo (4/12), long-term healing rates were 66.7% (4/6) and 50.0% (2/4), respectively.

Nurses play a key role in fighting this disease and are at risk of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, there is an urgent need to assess the mental health condition of nurses and establish appropriate interventions to reduce the negative psychiatric outcomes of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the knowledge and psychological stress related to COVID-19 among nursing staff and to provide evidence of the need for targeted training and psychological intervention. METHODS: This cross-sectional web-based survey study was performed in a class 3 grade A general hospital in a southwest province of China from March 1 to March 15, 2020. A self-designed questionnaire with questions about COVID-19–related prevention and control knowledge and the Triage Assessment Form (TAF) were used to assess nursing staff’s knowledge of COVID-19 and their degree of psychological stress, respectively. SPSS 23.0 was applied for statistical analysis of the collected data. RESULTS: A total of 979 nurses completed the questionnaire. The results showed that the nursing staff provided the fewest correct answers to questions about continuous viral nucleic acid testing specifications (379/979 correct answers, 38.7%), isolation/discharge criteria (539/979 correct answers, 55.1%), and management measures for patients with suspected symptoms (713/979 correct answers, 72.8%). The median total score of the TAF was 7.0 (IQR 5.0-12.0), and there were statistically significant differences in scores between different nursing roles, years of work experience, and hospital departments (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that nursing staff have insufficient knowledge about COVID-19. Meanwhile, although the psychological damage to nurses during the pandemic was found to be low, nurse managers must continue to monitor the mental health of nursing staff and perform timely interventions.","Huang, Huaping; Zhao, Wen-Jun; Li, Gui-Rong",JMIR Form Res,50,8

METHOD: The data of laboratory‐confirmed 188,897 COVID‐19 patients diagnosed between March 11, 2020 and June 22, 2020 included in the Republic of Turkey, Ministry of Health database were analyzed retrospectively. All of the COVID‐19 patients with hematological malignancy (n=740) were included in the study and an age, gender and comorbidity matched COVID‐19 patients without cancer (n=740) at 1:1 ratio was used for comparison. RESULTS: Non Hodgkin lymphoma (30.1%), myelodysplastic syndrome (19.7%), myeloproliferative neoplasm (15.7%), were the most common hematological malignancies. The rates of severe and critical disease were significantly higher in patients with hematological malignancy compared to the patients without cancer (p=0.001). The rates of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admission were higher in patients with hematological malignancy compared to the patients without cancer (p=0.023, p=0.001, respectively). The length of hospital stay and ICU stay were similar between groups (p=0.7, p=0.3; retrospectively). The rate of mechanical ventilation (MV) support was higher in patients with hematological malignancy compared to the control group (p=0.001). The case fatality rate (CFR) was 13.8% in patients with hematological malignancy, and it was 6.8% in the control group (p=0.001). CONCLUSION: This study reveals that there is an increased risk of COVID‐19 related serious events (ICU admission, MV support or death) in patients with hematological malignancy compared to COVID‐19 patients without cancer and supports high vulnerability of patients with hematological malignancy in the current pandemic.

Methods: We set up an experimental study comparing endometrial tissue from recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL, n = 30) and fertile control (CTR, n = 20) women in terms of pinopode expression/morphology; expression of thrombomodulin (TM) and ezrin; cytoskeletal organization. Endometrial samples were collected during implantation window and evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, western blot, and immunofluorescence. Results: We found that RPL endometrial tissue showed: (i) increased pinopodes density (* p < 0.05); (ii) a reduced diameter of pinopodes (* p < 0.05); (iii) a decreased TM and ezrin expression (p < 0.05). Additionally, confocal images showed a significantly reduced expression of phosphorylated (p)-ezrin, confirming the results obtained through immunoblot analysis. Immunofluorescence staining showed that in CTR samples, junctions between cells are intact and clearly visible, whereas actin filaments appear completely lost in RPL endometrial samples; this suggests that, due to the impaired expression and activity of TM and ezrin, actin does not bind to plasma membrane in order to orchestrate the cytoskeletal actin filaments. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that an impaired expression of TM and expression/activation of ezrin may affect the connection between the TM and actin cytoskeleton, impairing the organization of cytoskeleton and, eventually, the adequate pinopode development.","D’Ippolito, Silvia; Di Nicuolo, Fiorella; Papi, Massimiliano; Castellani, Roberta; Palmieri, Valentina; Masciullo, Valeria; Arena, Vincenzo; Tersigni, Chiara; Bernabei, Micaela; Pontecorvi, Alfredo; Scambia, Giovanni; Di Simone, Nicoletta",J Clin Med,50,16

Meanwhile, religious institutions—including synagogues—typically use diverse media, including websites, bulletins/newsletters, and calendars to inform current and potential members about both general (e.g., theological) and specific practical messages (e.g., about the occurrence of services, meetings, and programs). Given the historical role synagogue centers played in the early- to mid-twentieth century in providing members recreational and sport programming, we were interested to know what physical activities synagogues currently advertise through the aforementioned media. From January through May 2019, we completed a line-by-line analysis of the public websites of a large nationally representative sample of synagogues (n = 1383 sites from 337 U.S. cities in 39 states) to assess content (including links to bulletins/newsletters and calendars) related to child and adolescent physical activity. Only 35.4% of the sampled websites used these media to mention that their synagogue provided even a single physical activity program/event. Thus, most synagogues either (a) did not provide physical activity programs for children and adolescents, or (b) neglected to use online platforms to promote engagement in them. We found 938 distinct programs/events and 1667 specific activities across synagogue websites that mentioned at least one physical activity. Programs by type and proportion (i.e., percentage of programs overall) included youth group (39.1%), preschool (26.9%), youth worship (18.0%), and youth education (16.0%).

Future research should examine the beliefs that synagogue rabbis and media gatekeepers hold toward physical activity in general and youth physical activity specifically.

Extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) is a marker of pulmonary oedema which is associated with mortality in ARDS. In this study we evaluate whether EVLWI is higher in patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS as compared to controls and whether EVLWI has the potential to monitor disease progression. METHODS: From the day of intubation, EVLWI, cardiac function were monitored by transpulmonary thermodilution in n=25 patients with COVID-19 and compared to a control group of 49 non-COVID-19 ARDS-patients. RESULTS: EVLWI in COVID-19-patients was noticeably elevated and significantly higher than in the control group (17 (11-38) vs. 11 (6-26) mL/kg; p<0.001). High pulmonary vascular permeability index values (2.9 (1.0-5.2) versus 1.9 (1.0-5.2); p=0.003) suggest inflammatory oedema. By contrast, the cardiac parameters SVI, GEF and GEDVI were comparable. High EVLWI values were associated with viral persistence, prolonged intensive care treatment and mortality (23.2{+/-}6.7% vs. 30.3{+/-}6.0%, p=0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the control group, COVID-19 results in markedly elevated EVLWI-values in patients with ARDS. EVLWI reflects a non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in COVID-19 associated ARDS and could serve as parameter to monitor ARDS progression.","Rasch, S.; Schmidle, P.; Sancak, S.; Herner, A.; Huberle, C.; Schulz, D.; Mayr, U.; Schneider, J.; Spinner, C.; Geisler, F.; Schmid, R.

Based on a battery of indicators, the 21 administrative regions of Italy were assigned a risk level among yellow, orange, red, and, starting on 6 November 2020, different type of restrictions were applied accordingly. This event represents a natural experiment that allows the evaluation of the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions, free from those nuisance factors affecting cross-national studies. In this work, we extract the daily growth rate of new cases, hospitalizations and patients in ICU from official data using an unobserved components model and assess how the different restrictions had different impacts in reducing the speed of spread of the virus. We find that all the three packages of restrictions have an effect on the speed of spread of the disease, but while the mildest (yellow) policy leads to a constant number of hospitalizations (zero growth rate), the strictest (red) policy is able to halve the number of accesses to regular wards and intensive care units in about one month. The effects of the intermediate (orange) policy are more volatile and seem to be only slightly more effective than the milder (yellow) policy.","Pelagatti, Matteo; Maranzano, Paolo",Health Policy,50,24

The formation of immature secretory granules was as fast ( t 1 2 ≈ 5 min ) as that of constitutive secretory vesicles identified by the presence of a rapidly secreted heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Using the cell-free system, the formation of post-Golgi secretory vesicles was found to be dependent upon ATP. Two distinct populations of vesicles were formed: immature secretory granules containing secretogranin II and constitutive secretory vesicles containing the heparan sulfate proteoglycan. These results show that in a cell-free system, a constitutive and a regulated secretory protein are sorted upon exit from the trans-Golgi network.","Tooze, Sharon A.; Huttner, Wieland B.",Cell,50,3

An understanding of the immune response associated with protection could facilitate rapid licensure of new vaccines. Methods: Data from a randomised efficacy trial of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine in the UK was analysed to determine the antibody levels associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2. Anti-spike and anti-RBD IgG by multiplex immunoassay, pseudovirus and live neutralizing antibody at 28 days after the second dose were measured in infected and non-infected vaccine recipients. Weighted generalised additive models for binary data were applied to outcome. Cubic spline smoothed log antibody levels, and baseline risk of exposure were the predictor variables with weights applied to account for selection bias in sample processing. Results: Higher levels of all immune markers were correlated with a reduced risk of symptomatic infection. Vaccine efficacy of 80% against primary symptomatic COVID-19 was achieved with antibody level of 40923 (95% CI: 16748, 125017) and 63383 (95% CI: 16903, not computed (NC)) for anti-spike and anti-RBD, and 185 (95% CI: NC, NC) and 247 (95% CI: 101, NC) for pseudo- and live-neutralisation assays respectively. Antibody responses did not correlate with overall protection against asymptomatic infection. Conclusions: Correlates of protection can be used to bridge to new populations using validated assays. The data can be used to extrapolate efficacy estimates for new vaccines where large efficacy trials cannot be conducted. More work is needed to assess correlates for emerging variants.","Feng, S.; Phillips, D.; White, T.; Sayal, H.; Aley, P. K.; Bibi, S.; Dold, C.; Fuskova, M.; Gilbert, S. C.; Hirsch, I.; Humphries, H.

Design Three cross-sectional surveys. Participants Individuals who participated in the Swiss Health Surveys 2007, 2012, and 2017. We calculated the proportion reporting influenza vaccination in the last 12 months, and performed multivariable logistic regression analyses. Results: The proportion of reporting a history of influenza vaccination overall was 31.9% (95% confidence intervals [95% CI] 31.4-32.4); and dropped from 34.5% in 2007 to 28.8% in 2017. The uptake of vaccination within the past 12 months was 16% in 2007 and similar in 2012 and 2017 (around 14%). In people with chronic disease, uptake dropped from 43.8% in 2007 to 37.1% in 2012 and to 31.6% in 2017 (p<0.001). In people aged [â¥]65 years, uptake dropped from 47.8% in 2007 to 38.5% in 2012 to 36.2% in 2017 (p<0.001). Similarly, a decrease in vaccine uptake was seen in people with poor self-reported health status (39.4%, 33.1%, and 27.0%). In logistic regression, self-reported vaccination coverage decreased in the 65 to 75 years old (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) aOR 0.56, 95% Cl 0.48-0.66 between 2007 and 2012; aOR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77-1.03). Uptake was positively associated with the [â¥]65 age group, living in French-speaking and urban areas, history of smoking, bad self-reported health status, private/semiprivate health insurance, having a medical profession, and having any underlying chronic disease. Use of any alternative medicine therapy was negatively associated with influenza vaccination (aOR 0.72, 95% CI 0.67-0.80). Conclusion: Influenza vaccination coverage was low in older and chronically ill persons. Significant efforts are required in preparing for the flu season 2020/21 to reduce the double burden of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza. These efforts should include campaigns but also novel approaches using social media.","Zuercher, Kathrin; Zwahlen, Marcel; Berlin, Claudia; Egger, Matthias; Fenner, Lukas",,50,22

However, the antiviral functions of IFITMs against fish viruses remain largely uncertain. In this study, the IFITM3 homolog from orange spotted grouper (EcIFITM3) was cloned and its roles in grouper virus infection were investigated. The full-length cDNA of EcIFITM3 was 737 bp, which was composed of a 16 bp 5′-UTR, a 274 bp 3′-UTR, and a 447 bp ORF. EcIFITM3 encodes a 148-amino-acid polypeptide, which contains five domains, i.e., the N-terminal domain (aa 1–65), TM1 (aa 66–90), the cytoplasmic domain (aa 91–110), TM2 (aa 111–140), and the C-terminal domain (aa 141–148), and shares 78% and 47% identity with IFITM3 of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) and human (Homo sapiens), respectively. EcIFITM3 mRNA was detected in 12 tissues of healthy groupers, with the highest expression levels in the head kidney. Additionally, the in vitro mRNA levels of EcIFITM3 were significantly upregulated by infection with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) or red spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), or treatment with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Subcellular localization analysis showed that EcIFITM3 was mainly distributed in the cell membrane of grouper cells. In vitro, the ectopic expression of EcIFITM3 inhibited SGIV and RGNNV infection, as demonstrated by the reduced severity of the cytopathic effect, decreased virus production, and low levels of viral mRNA and proteins. Consistently, knockdown of EcIFITM3 by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) enhanced SGIV and RGNNV replication. EcIFITM3 overexpression and knockdown experiments both suggested that EcIFITM3 inhibits the infection of SGIV and RGNNV by restricting virus entry.","Zhang, Ya; Huang, Youhua; Wang, Liqun; Huang, Liwei; Zheng, Jiaying; Huang, Xiaohong; Qin, Qiwei",Fish Shellfish Immunol,50,29

As of May 2020, Turkey is among the top ten countries with the most cases. A comprehensive genomic characterization of the virus isolates in Turkey is yet to be carried out. Here, we built a phylogenetic tree with globally obtained 15,277 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes. We identified the subtypes based on the phylogenetic clustering in comparison with the previously annotated classifications. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of the first thirty SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated and sequenced in Turkey. We suggest that the first introduction of the virus to the country is earlier than the first reported case of infection. Virus genomes isolated from Turkey are dispersed among most types in the phylogenetic tree. We find two of the seventeen sub-clusters enriched with the isolates of Turkey, which likely have spread expansively in the country. Finally, we traced virus genomes based on their phylogenetic placements. This analysis suggested multiple independent international introductions of the virus and revealed a hub for the inland transmission. We released a web application to track the global and interprovincial virus spread of the isolates from Turkey in comparison to thousands of genomes worldwide.","Adebalı, Ogün; Bırcan, Aylin; Çırcı, Defne; İşlek, Burak; Kilinç, Zeynep; Selçuk, Berkay; Turhan, Berk",bioRxiv,50,29

In this retrospective study, data pertaining to the 31 OHCWs diagnosed with COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, were retrieved and analyzed. Questionnaires were administered to the subjects over the Internet and telephone. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics and information on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) were collected. There were 22 females and 9 males, with a median age of 39 y. Although the severity of most cases of COVID-19 (93.5%) was mild or moderate, 1 case was severe, and another case was critical, resulting in death. Fever was the main first symptom of COVID-19, followed by fatigue and myalgia. Most of the OHCWs routinely used PPE such as medical masks, gloves, caps, and work clothes while performing clinical work. N95 or KN95 masks were rarely available because of the scarcity of PPE during the outbreak. Nineteen OHCWs reported a contact history, among whom 7 worked in a fever clinic, 5 reported contact with dental patients suspected of having COVID-19, and 7 reported contact with family members with COVID-19–related symptoms at least 1 d earlier. Our findings indicated that there were few clusters of COVID-19 in dental settings. Since the outbreak, the Hospital of Stomatology, Wuhan University, has provided emergency dental treatment, and none of their staff were infected while providing dental service, which indicates that comprehensive measures such as the use of advanced PPE and environmental disinfection can prevent cross-infection in dental practice. The analysis of the procedures followed during the emergency treatments indicated that OHCWs preferred to recommend conservative treatment to patients, suggesting that attention should be paid to the psychological impact of COVID-19 on dental practitioners.","Meng, L.; Ma, B.; Cheng, Y.; Bian, Z.",J Dent Res,50,20

Using a previously established reconstituted VF model, we addressed the functions of MT-components and MTOCs concerning their roles in the formation of filamentous VFs. Indeed, the MTOC markers γ-tubulin and centrin were redistributed within the VF-like structures (VFLS) in a μ2-dependent manner. Moreover, the MT-nucleation centers significantly increased in numbers, and γ-tubulin was pulled-down in a binding assay when co-expressed with histidine-tagged-μ2 and μNS. Thus, μ2, by interaction with γ-tubulin, can modulate MTOCs localization and function according to viral needs.","Eichwald, Catherine; Ackermann, Mathias; Fraefel, Cornel",Virology,50,0

Differences were identified between the monthly severe asthma attack during the period 2017–2020 (p<0.001). The rate of severe asthma attack cases peaked in June and September 2020. The percentage of patients who failed to undergo pulmonary function tests was 34.5% in 2020, remarkably higher than in the previous 3 years (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The situation and management of pediatric asthma during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic differed from those in previous years, with more emphasis placed on disease prevention practices and facilities. To design future pediatric asthma management practice, the environmental and psychological impact on asthma management should also be considered. Local areas should make good use of telemedicine to manage pediatric asthma effectively.","Zhang, Lei; Wang, Xinglu; Huang, Yijie; Ai, Tao; Liao, Huiling; Hu, Jie; Tang, Wei; Huang, Yuanyuan",J Asthma Allergy,50,22

The complexity and dynamics of the immune response present a challenge to understanding variation in SARS-CoV-2 infections. To address this challenge, we apply control theory, a framework used to study complex feedback systems, to establish rigorous mathematical bounds on immune responses. Two mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 biology are sufficient to create extreme variation between hosts: (1) a sparsely expressed host receptor and (2) potent, but not unique, suppression of interferon. The resulting model unifies disparate and unexplained features of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, predicts features of future viruses that threaten to cause pandemics, and identifies potential interventions.","Sarma, Anish A.; Sarma, Aartik; Csete, Marie; Lee, Peter P.; Doyle, John C.",bioRxiv,50,20

However, direct clinical evidence linking increased inspiratory effort to lung injury is scarce. We adapted a computational simulator of cardiopulmonary pathophysiology to quantify the mechanical forces that could lead to P-SILI at different levels of respiratory effort. In accordance with recent data, the simulator parameters were manually adjusted to generate a population of 10 patients that recapitulate clinical features exhibited by certain COVID-19 patients, i.e., severe hypoxaemia combined with relatively well-preserved lung mechanics, being treated with supplemental oxygen. RESULTS: Simulations were conducted at tidal volumes (VT) and respiratory rates (RR) of 7 ml/kg and 14 breaths/min (representing normal respiratory effort) and at VT/RR of 7/20, 7/30, 10/14, 10/20 and 10/30 ml/kg / breaths/min. While oxygenation improved with higher respiratory efforts, significant increases in multiple indicators of the potential for lung injury were observed at all higher VT/RR combinations tested. Pleural pressure swing increased from 12.0 ± 0.3 cmH(2)O at baseline to 33.8 ± 0.4 cmH(2)O at VT/RR of 7 ml/kg/30 breaths/min and to 46.2 ± 0.5 cmH(2)O at 10 ml/kg/30 breaths/min. Transpulmonary pressure swing increased from 4.7 ± 0.1 cmH(2)O at baseline to 17.9 ± 0.3 cmH(2)O at VT/RR of 7 ml/kg/30 breaths/min and to 24.2 ± 0.3 cmH(2)O at 10 ml/kg/30 breaths/min. Total lung strain increased from 0.29 ± 0.006 at baseline to 0.65 ± 0.016 at 10 ml/kg/30 breaths/min. Mechanical power increased from 1.6 ± 0.1 J/min at baseline to 12.9 ± 0.2 J/min at VT/RR of 7 ml/kg/30 breaths/min, and to 24.9 ± 0.3 J/min at 10 ml/kg/30 breaths/min. Driving pressure increased from 7.7 ± 0.2 cmH(2)O at baseline to 19.6 ± 0.2 cmH(2)O at VT/RR of 7 ml/kg/30 breaths/min, and to 26.9 ± 0.3 cmH(2)O at 10 ml/kg/30 breaths/min. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the forces generated by increased inspiratory effort commonly seen in COVID-19 acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure are comparable with those that have been associated with ventilator-induced lung injury during mechanical ventilation. Respiratory efforts in these patients should be carefully monitored and controlled to minimise the risk of lung injury.

Constant expiratory flow, as provided by the new flow-controlled ventilation (FCV) mode, was shown to improve lung recruitment. We hypothesized that lung aeration and respiratory mechanics improve in obese patients during FCV. METHODS: We compared FCV and volume-controlled (VCV) ventilation in 23 obese patients in a randomized crossover setting. Starting with baseline measurements, ventilation settings were kept identical except for the ventilation mode related differences (VCV: inspiration to expiration ratio 1:2 with passive expiration, FCV: inspiration to expiration ratio 1:1 with active, linearized expiration). Primary endpoint of the study was the change of end-expiratory lung volume compared to baseline ventilation. Secondary endpoints were the change of mean lung volume, respiratory mechanics and hemodynamic variables. RESULTS: The loss of end-expiratory lung volume and mean lung volume compared to baseline was lower during FCV compared to VCV (end-expiratory lung volume: FCV, − 126 ± 207 ml; VCV, − 316 ± 254 ml; p < 0.001, mean lung volume: FCV, − 108.2 ± 198.6 ml; VCV, − 315.8 ± 252.1 ml; p < 0.001) and at comparable plateau pressure (baseline, 19.6 ± 3.7; VCV, 20.2 ± 3.4; FCV, 20.2 ± 3.8 cmH(2)O; p = 0.441), mean tracheal pressure was higher (baseline, 13.1 ± 1.1; VCV, 12.9 ± 1.2; FCV, 14.8 ± 2.2 cmH(2)O; p < 0.001). All other respiratory and hemodynamic variables were comparable between the ventilation modes. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that, compared to VCV, FCV improves regional ventilation distribution of the lung at comparable PEEP, tidal volume, P(Plat) and ventilation frequency. The increase in end-expiratory lung volume during FCV was probably caused by the increased mean tracheal pressure which can be attributed to the linearized expiratory pressure decline.

Instead, scholars most often examine how news media report health issues. In this study, we recognized the role of time by taking into account how media report differs based on when a global outbreak is confirmed in a country and when it is not. We focused on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and examined six media—two TV stations, two newspapers and two radio stations. We content-analysed 537 stories and found that there were few stories about the virus before it was confirmed in Nigeria. But as soon as Nigeria recorded a confirmed case, the number of stories tripled. We also noticed that story format and recommendation on health behaviour were also closely linked to the COVID-19 status of Nigeria. However, we did not find an association between Nigeria’s COVID-19 status and policy recommendation among the media studied. Therefore, this study concludes that Nigerian media did not provide sufficient health warning messages on COVID-19 before its spread to the country.","Gever, Verlumun Celestine; Ezeah, Gregory",Health Educ Res,50,17

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional follow-up study is a sequel to a study by Biadsee et al. Among the previous study population of 128 non-hospitalized patients, positive for COVID-19 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 97 patients participated in a survey designed for this study. Information and data regarding loss of smell and taste, rate of recovery, xerostomia, and additional symptoms; (Cough, Myalgia, Weakness, Rhinorrhea, Nasal congestion) were collected. RESULTS: A total of 43 men and 54 women were included. Mean age was 37.5 years (range 19–74). Mean follow-up was 229 days (range 191–253). Sixty-five patients reported gustatory dysfunction during the disease of which 61.5% reported full recovery, 38.5% partial recovery. Of 65 patients who reported olfactory impairment during the disease, 52% had full recovery and 48% reported partial recovery of olfactory function. Complete recovery of olfactory function was positively associated with full recovery of gustatory function (p = 0.01). Gender did not significantly affect the recovery of OD and GD (p = 0.45, p = 0.90, respectively). Patients who experienced olfactory dysfunction as an initial symptom had lower rates of olfactory complete recovery (p = 0.043). CONCLUSION: After a mean follow-up of 229 days, complete recovery of smell and taste functions occurred in 52% and 61.5%, respectively. However, dysfunction persisted in 48%–38.5% of patients.","Biadsee, Ameen; Dagan, Or; Ormianer, Zeev; Kassem, Firas; Masarwa, Shchada; Biadsee, Ameer",Am J Otolaryngol,50,1

To assure proper sample collection, sample adequacy controls (SACs) are needed that detect substances indicative of samples collected within the oral cavity. This study evaluated two candidate SACs for this purpose. One detected representative oral microbiota (Streptococcus species DNA) and the other, human cells (human mitochondrial DNA, mtDNA). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays for the two target cell types were applied to buccal swabs (representing samples collected within the oral cavity) and hand swabs (representing improperly collected samples) obtained from 51 healthy U.S. volunteers. Quantification cycle (Cq) cutoffs that maximized Youden’s index were established for each assay. The streptococcal target at a Cq cutoff of ≤34.9 had 99.0% sensitivity and specificity for oral swab samples, whereas human mtDNA perfectly distinguished between hand and mouth swabs with a Cq cutoff of 31.3. The human mtDNA test was then applied to buccal, tongue, and gum swabs that had previously been collected from TB patients and controls in South Africa, along with “air swabs” collected as negative controls (total N = 292 swabs from 71 subjects). Of these swabs, 287/292 (98%) exhibited the expected Cq values. In a paired analysis the three oral sites yielded indistinguishable amounts of human mtDNA, however PurFlock(TM) swabs collected slightly more human mtDNA than did OmniSwabs(TM) (p = 0.012). The results indicate that quantification of human mtDNA cannot distinguish swabs collected from different sites within the mouth. However, it can reliably distinguish oral swabs from swabs that were not used orally, which makes it a useful SAC for oral swab-based diagnosis.","Deviaene, Meagan; Weigel, Kris M.; Wood, Rachel C.; Luabeya, Angelique K.

Ensemble neural networks are composed of a set of modules, which are used to produce several predictions under different conditions. The modules are simple neural networks. Fuzzy logic is then used to aggregate the responses of several predictor modules, in this way, improving the final prediction by combining the outputs of the modules in an intelligent way. Fuzzy logic handles the uncertainty in the process of making a final decision about the prediction. The complete model was tested for the case of predicting the COVID-19 time series in Mexico, at the level of the states and the whole country. The simulation results of the multiple ensemble neural network models with fuzzy response integration show very good predicted values in the validation data set. In fact, the prediction errors of the multiple ensemble neural networks are significantly lower than using traditional monolithic neural networks, in this way showing the advantages of the proposed approach.","Melin, Patricia; Monica, Julio Cesar; Sanchez, Daniela; Castillo, Oscar",Healthcare (Basel),50,1

We aimed to assess the clinical outcomes in these patients. METHODS: In this multicentre cohort study, we collected data on patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, who were older than 18 years, who had previously received a liver transplant, and for whom data had been submitted by clinicians to one of two international registries (COVID-Hep and SECURE-Cirrhosis) at the end of the patient's disease course. Patients without a known hospitalisation status or mortality outcome were excluded. For comparison, data from a contemporaneous cohort of consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who had not received a liver transplant were collected from the electronic patient records of the Oxford University Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust. We compared the cohorts with regard to several outcomes (including death, hospitalisation, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, requirement for intensive care, and need for invasive ventilation). A propensity score-matched analysis was done to test for an association between liver transplant and death. FINDINGS: Between March 25 and June 26, 2020, data were collected for 151 adult liver transplant recipients from 18 countries (median age 60 years [IQR 47–66], 102 [68%] men, 49 [32%] women) and 627 patients who had not undergone liver transplantation (median age 73 years [44–84], 329 [52%] men, 298 [48%] women). The groups did not differ with regard to the proportion of patients hospitalised (124 [82%] patients in the liver transplant cohort vs 474 [76%] in the comparison cohort, p=0·106), or who required intensive care (47 [31%] vs 185 [30%], p=0·837). However, ICU admission (43 [28%] vs 52 [8%], p<0·0001) and invasive ventilation (30 [20%] vs 32 [5%], p<0·0001) were more frequent in the liver transplant cohort. 28 (19%) patients in the liver transplant cohort died, compared with 167 (27%) in the comparison cohort (p=0·046). In the propensity score-matched analysis (adjusting for age, sex, creatinine concentration, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and ethnicity), liver transplantation did not significantly increase the risk of death in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (absolute risk difference 1·4% [95% CI −7·7 to 10·4]). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that age (odds ratio 1·06 [95% CI 1·01 to 1·11] per 1 year increase), serum creatinine concentration (1·57 [1·05 to 2·36] per 1 mg/dL increase), and non-liver cancer (18·30 [1·96 to 170·75]) were associated with death among liver transplant recipients. INTERPRETATION: Liver transplantation was not independently associated with death, whereas increased age and presence of comorbidities were. Factors other than transplantation should be preferentially considered in relation to physical distancing and provision of medical care for patients with liver transplants during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, these impacts are not distributed equally: already marginalized populations, specifically racial/ethnic minority groups and sexual and gender minority populations, may be more likely to suffer the effects of COVID-19. The COVID-19 Resiliency Survey was conducted by the city of Chicago to assess the impact of COVID-19 on city residents in the wake of Chicago’s initial lockdown, with particular focus on the experiences of minority populations. Chi-square tests of independence were performed to compare COVID-19-related outcomes and impacts on heterosexual vs. sexual minority populations, cisgender vs. gender minority populations, and White vs. racial/ethnic minority subgroups. Marginalized populations experienced significant disparities in COVID-19 exposure, susceptibility, and treatment access, as well as in psychosocial effects of the pandemic. Notably, Black and Latinx populations reported significant difficulties accessing food and supplies (p = 0.002). Healthcare access disparities were also visible, with Black and Latinx respondents reporting significantly lower levels of access to a provider to see if COVID-19 testing would be appropriate (p = 0.013), medical services (p = 0.001), and use of telehealth for mental health services (p = 0.001). Sexual minority respondents reported significantly lower rates of using telehealth for mental health services (p = 0.011), and gender minority respondents reported significantly lower levels of primary care provider access (p = 0.016). There are evident COVID-19 disparities experienced in Chicago especially for Black, Latinx, sexual minority, and gender minority groups.

Here, we show that the N‐terminal domain (NTD) of the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein substantially induces multiple inflammatory molecules in myeloid cells and human PBMCs. Using a combination of phenotypic screening with machine learning‐based modeling, we identified and experimentally validated several protein kinases, including JAK1, EPHA7, IRAK1, MAPK12, and MAP3K8, as essential downstream mediators of NTD‐induced cytokine production, implicating the role of multiple signaling pathways in cytokine release. Further, we found several FDA‐approved drugs, including ponatinib, and cobimetinib as potent inhibitors of the NTD‐mediated cytokine release. Treatment with ponatinib outperforms other drugs, including dexamethasone and baricitinib, inhibiting all cytokines in response to the NTD from SARS‐CoV‐2 and emerging variants. Finally, ponatinib treatment inhibits lipopolysaccharide‐mediated cytokine release in myeloid cells in vitro and lung inflammation mouse model.

Viral infections have a greater impact on CF patients compared to non-CF controls. They result in increased respiratory symptoms, deterioration of Shwachman and radiological scores, prolonged hospitalizations, a persistent decrease of pulmonary function, increased use of antibiotics and a higher frequency of exacerbations at follow-up. In addition, interaction between viruses and bacteria in CF is suggested. Some studies observe increased new bacterial colonization and raised antipseudomonal antibodies in episodes of viral respiratory infections. Experimental data suggest that increased virus replication, impaired specific anti-bacterial defense and increased adherence of bacteria play a role in the pathogenesis of viral respiratory infections in CF. Further knowledge about the role of viruses and interaction with bacteria in CF lung disease might result in new therapeutic strategies to improve prognosis of CF patients.","van Ewijk, Bart E.; van der Zalm, Marieke M.; Wolfs, Tom F.W.; van der Ent, Cornelis K.",J Cyst Fibros,50,1

The nanotoxicity affects the range between induction of cellular stress and cytotoxicity. The reasons so far reported for these toxicological effects are due to their variable sizes with high surface areas, shape, charge, and physicochemical properties, which upon interaction with the biological components may influence their functioning and result in adverse outcomes (AO). Thus, understanding the risk produced by these materials now is an important safety concern for the development of nanotechnology and nanomedicine. Since the time nanotoxicology has evolved, the methods employed have been majorly relied on in vitro cell-based evaluations, while these simple methods may not predict the complexity involved in preclinical and clinical conditions concerning pharmacokinetics, organ toxicity, and toxicities evidenced through multiple cellular levels. The safety profiles of nanoscale nanomaterials and nanoformulations in the delivery of drugs and therapeutic applications are of considerable concern. In addition, the safety assessment for new nanomedicine formulas lacks regulatory standards. Though the in vivo studies are greatly needed, the end parameters used for risk assessment are not predicting the possible toxic effects produced by various nanoformulations. On the other side, due to increased restrictions on animal usage and demand for the need for high-throughput assays, there is a need for developing and exploring novel methods to evaluate NPs safety concerns. The progress made in molecular biology and the availability of several modern techniques may offer novel and innovative methods to evaluate the toxicological behavior of different NPs by using single cells, cell population, and whole organisms. This review highlights the recent novel methods developed for the evaluation of the safety impacts of NPs and attempts to solve the problems that come with risk assessment. The relevance of investigating adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) in nanotoxicology has been stressed in particular.","Tirumala, Mounika Gayathri; Anchi, Pratibha; Raja, Susmitha; Rachamalla, Mahesh; Godugu, Chandraiah",Front Pharmacol,50,24

The purpose of this study is to quantify the burden of pneumonia among hospitalized patients with influenza. METHODS: Real-world retrospective data from 01JAN2014-30JUN2019 (study period) were obtained from Optum’s de-identified Clinformatics® Data Mart Database (2007–2020) for patients who had ≥ 1 diagnosis for influenza during the identification period and ≥ 1 all-cause inpatient visit within 1 day of diagnosis. Cases had ≥ 1 diagnosis claim for an influenza-related pneumonia within the 30 days after the initial influenza diagnosis date. Controls had no evidence of influenza-related pneumonia in the 30 days following the initial influenza diagnosis. Final 1:1 matching was determined using propensity score matching (PSM). Statistical significance between the cohorts was tested. RESULTS: After PSM, there were 4878 hospitalized patients with influenza in each of the case and control groups. During the index hospitalization, cases vs. controls had longer length of stay [Mean (standard deviation): 6.5 (8.3) vs. 1.9 (3.7)], greater intensive care unit (ICU) use (38.4 vs. 16.8%), and greater mechanical ventilation use (invasive: 11.4 vs. 2.3%; non-invasive: 6.8 vs. 2.6%) (all p < 0.001). Cases also had higher readmission rates than controls (12.3 vs. 3.5% within 30 days; 20.0 vs. 6.1% within 90 days; p < 0.001 for both). Post-index date direct all-cause healthcare costs were higher for cases than for controls (median total cost: $18,428 vs. $621 for 30 days; $21,774 vs. $3312 for 90 days; $25,960 vs. $8699 for 6 months; $35,875 vs. $21,619 for 1 year; all p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonia as a complication of influenza increases risk of mortality and leads to greater healthcare resource use and direct medical costs among patients hospitalized with influenza. These effects are seen early during the index hospitalization and within the first 30 days after diagnosis, but their impact continues throughout a year of follow-up.

They can be derived from adult stem cells, embryonic stem cells, or induced pluripotent stem cells. They contain most of the relevant cell types with a topology and cell-to-cell interactions resembling that of the in vivo tissue. The widespread and increasing adoption of organoid-based technologies in human biomedical research is testament to their enormous potential in basic, translational- and applied-research. In a similar fashion there appear to be ample possibilities for research applications of organoids from livestock and companion animals. Furthermore, organoids as in vitro models offer a great possibility to reduce the use of experimental animals. Here, we provide an overview of studies on organoids in livestock and companion animal species, with focus on the methods developed for organoids from a variety of tissues/organs from various animal species and on the applications in veterinary research. Current limitations, and ongoing research to address these limitations, are discussed. Further, we elaborate on a number of fields of research in animal nutrition, host-microbe interactions, animal breeding and genomics, and animal biotechnology, in which organoids may have great potential as an in vitro research tool.","Kar, Soumya K.; Wells, Jerry M.; Ellen, Esther D.; te Pas, Marinus F.

Oral cancer involving anterior arch of mandible is difficult to reconstruct and ideally, requires free fibular osteomyocutaneous flap. During this time of resource constraint situation, these free flaps are not a great choice, as it increases exposure of both patient and surgical team to the deadly virus. We are describing a novel method of reconstruction after resection of oral cancer involving anterior arch of mandible. In this new technique, we have reconstructed central arch defect by hanging bipaddle pectoralis major myocutaneous flap with orbicularis oris muscle using ethylene terephthalate suture. Operative time, early postoperative complications and early cosmetic and functional outcome were assessed. We have used this novel technique in eight patients of T4a oral cancer involving anterior arch of mandible and skin over chin. Mean operative time was 180 min. One patient had minor flap loss with surgical site infection (Clavien-Dindo grade I). In all patients, we were able to discharge all patients on eighth postoperative day. Cosmetic outcome and functional outcomes were mostly satisfactory. All patients were able to oppose their lips without any oral incompetence and drooling. Tongue mobility was good. There was no incidence of ‘Andy Gump deformity’. This is a feasible option for reconstructing anterior arch defect in resource- and time-limited setting of COVID 19 pandemic. This technique can also be used in comorbid conditions where it is not advisable to do very long surgery.","Rajan, Shiv; Akhtar, Naseem; Kumar, Vijay; Gupta, Sameer; Misra, Sanjeev; Chaturvedi, Arun; Prakash, Puneet; Azhar, Tashbihul",Indian J Surg Oncol,50,16

With emphasis on the relationship between the Hopf bifurcation and the time-delay, we investigate the effect of time-delay by choosing it as the bifurcation parameter. By using tools from control and bifurcation theory, it is proved that there exists a critical value of time-delay for the stability of the model. When the time-delay passes through the critical value, the model loses its stability and a Hopf bifurcation occurs. To enhance the stability of the model, we propose an improved hybrid control strategy in which state feedback and parameter perturbation are used. Through linear stability analysis, we show that by adjusting the control parameter properly, the onset of Hopf bifurcation of the controlled model can be delayed or eliminated without changing the equilibrium point of the model. Finally, numerical simulations are given to verify the theoretical analysis.","Ding, Dawei; Zhang, Xiaoyun; Wang, Nian; Liang, Dong",J Shanghai Jiaotong Univ Sci,50,1

The Love and Sex in the Time of COVID-19 survey was conducted online from April to May, 2020. GBMSM were recruited through advertisements featured on social networking platforms, recruiting a sample size of 518 GBMSM. Analysis considers changes three in self-reported measures of sexual behavior: number of sex partners, number of anal sex partners and number of anal sex partners not protected by pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or condoms. Approximately two-thirds of the sample reported that they believed it was possible to contract COVID-19 through sex, with anal sex reported as the least risky sex act. Men did not generally feel it was important to reduce their number of sex partners during COVID-19, but reported a moderate willingness to have sex during COVID-19. For the period between February and April–May 20,202, participants reported a mean increase of 2.3 sex partners during COVID-19, a mean increase of 2.1 anal sex partners (range − 40 to 70), but a very small increase in the number of unprotected anal sex partners. Increases in sexual behavior during COVID-19 were associated with increases in substance use during the same period. High levels of sexual activity continue to be reported during the COVID-19 lockdown period and these high levels of sexual activity are often paralleled by increases in substance use and binge drinking. There is a clear need to continue to provide comprehensive HIV prevention and care services during COVID-19, and telehealth and other eHealth platforms provide a safe, flexible mechanism for providing services.","Stephenson, Rob; Chavanduka, Tanaka M.

In order to overcome these risks, we evaluated the potential of using a relatively short exposure of a low concentration of ozone to disinfect an indoor environment in the absence of individuals and animals. ICON3 by O3ZONO/M2L, a new disinfection device generating both ozone and negative ions, was selected to assess the potential of this strategy to inactivate different viral isolates of SARS-CoV-2. Tests under controlled laboratory conditions were performed in a system consisting of an ozone-proof airtight plastic box inside a biological safety cabinet, where suspensions of two strains of SARS-CoV-2 were exposed to ozone and negative ions and virucidal activity was measured by means of two complementary methodologies: viral replication capacity and viral titer determination. These studies revealed that low concentration ozone (average 3.18 ppm after the peak) inactivated up to >99% of SARS-CoV-2 within 20 minutes of exposure. Under controlled conditions, similar ozone exposure was recreated with ICON3 in different volume rooms (15, 30, 60 m3) where a linear relationship was observed between the room volume and the time of continuous ozone/ions flow required to reach and maintain the desired ozone levels used in the laboratory studies. These studies suggest that ICON3 may have the potential for use in the disinfection of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor environments in the absence of individuals and animals, under properly controlled and monitored safety conditions.","De Forni, Davide; Poddesu, Barbara; Cugia, Giulia; Gallizia, Giovanni; Licata, Massimo La; Lisziewicz, Julianna; Lori, Franco",bioRxiv,50,1

As an additional objective we sought to determine whether a different expression of IFN lambda 1–3 was associated with different harboring viruses, the clinical course of bronchiolitis or with the levels of well established IFN stimulated genes (ISGs), such as mixovirus resistance A (MxA) and ISG56. Methods The analysis was undertaken in 118 infants with RSV or HRV bronchiolitis. Nasopharyngeal washes were collected for virological studies and molecular analysis of type III IFN responses. Results RSV elicited higher levels of IFN lambda subtypes when compared with HRV. A similar expression of type III IFN was found in RSVA or RSVB infected infants and in those infected with HRVA or HRVC viruses. Results also indicate that IFN lambda 1 and IFN lambda 2–3 levels were correlated with each other and with MxA and ISG56-mRNAs. In addition, a positive correlation exists between the IFN lambda1 levels and the clinical score index during RSV infection. In particular, higher IFN lambda 1 levels are associated to an increase of respiratory rate. Conclusions These findings show that differences in the IFN lambda 1–3 levels in infants with RSV or HRV infections are present and that the expression of IFN lambda 1 correlates with the severity of RSV bronchiolitis.","Selvaggi, Carla; Pierangeli, Alessandra; Fabiani, Marco; Spano, Lucia; Nicolai, Ambra; Papoff, Paola; Moretti, Corrado; Midulla, Fabio; Antonelli, Guido; Scagnolari, Carolina",Journal of Infection,50,33

METHODS In a phase 3, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned adults with 4 to 14 migraine days per month in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive a once-daily dose of oral atogepant (10 mg, 30 mg, or 60 mg) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the mean number of migraine days per month across the 12 weeks. Secondary end points included headache days per month, a reduction from baseline of at least 50% in the 3-month average of migraine days per month, quality of life, and scores on the Activity Impairment in Migraine-Diary (AIM-D). RESULTS A total of 2270 participants were screened, 910 were enrolled, and 873 were included in the efficacy analysis; 214 were assigned to the 10-mg atogepant group, 223 to the 30-mg atogepant group, 222 to the 60-mg atogepant group, and 214 to the placebo group. The mean number of migraine days per month at baseline ranged from 7.5 to 7.9 in the four groups. The changes from baseline across 12 weeks were -3.7 days with 10-mg atogepant, -3.9 days with 30-mg atogepant, -4.2 days with 60-mg atogepant, and -2.5 days with placebo. The mean differences from placebo in the change from baseline were -1.2 days with 10-mg atogepant (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.8 to -0.6), -1.4 days with 30-mg atogepant (95% CI, -1.9 to -0.8), and -1.7 days with 60-mg atogepant (95% CI, -2.3 to -1.2) (P<0.001 for all comparisons with placebo). Results for the secondary end points favored atogepant over placebo with the exceptions of the AIM-D Performance of Daily Activities score and the AIM-D Physical Impairment score for the 10-mg dose. The most common adverse events were constipation (6.9 to 7.7% across atogepant doses) and nausea (4.4 to 6.1% across atogepant doses). Serious adverse events included one case each of asthma and optic neuritis in the 10-mg atogepant group. CONCLUSIONS Oral atogepant once daily was effective in reducing the number of migraine days and headache days over a period of 12 weeks. Adverse events included constipation and nausea. Longer and larger trials are needed to determine the effect and safety of atogepant for migraine prevention.

Diagnostic testing is currently limited in availability, accuracy, and efficiency. Imaging modalities such as chest radiograph (CXR), computed tomography, and lung ultrasound each demonstrate characteristic findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Lung ultrasound offers benefits over other imaging modalities including portability, cost, reduced exposure of healthcare workers as well as decreased contamination of equipment such as computed tomography scanners. CASE SERIES: Here we present a case series describing consistent lung ultrasound findings in patients with confirmed COVID-19 despite variable clinical presentations and CXR findings. We discuss a triage algorithm for clinical applicability and utility of lung point-of-care ultrasound in the setting of COVID-19 and advocate for judicious and targeted use of this tool. CONCLUSION: Lung point-of-care ultrasound can provide valuable data supporting diagnostic and triage decisions surrounding suspected cases of COVID-19. Prospective studies validating our proposed triage algorithm are warranted.","Duggan, Nicole M.; Liteplo, Andrew S.; Shokoohi, Hamid; Goldsmith, Andrew J.",Clin Pract Cases Emerg Med,50,30

We conducted a three-wave longitudinal study (N = 2364) three months before, during, and after the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Results showed that participants reported increased tendency of MINE during the COVID-19 outbreak than three months before the outbreak. Moreover, both initial MINE and the increased MINE predict less psychological distress including depression, anxiety, and stress, during and three months after the outbreak. Perceived benefits and costs of the COVID-19 mediated the long-term effect. These findings not only provide novel evidence for the meaning making model but also shed light on the underlying mechanism, suggesting an effective strategy to cope with stressful events such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Yang, Ziyan; Ji, Li-Jun; Yang, Ying; Wang, Yuqi; Zhu, Lifang; Cai, Huajian",Pers Individ Dif,50,1

Although the risk of COVID-19 infection is not increased in patients with inherited bleeding disorders, the indirect effects of this infection are many. METHODS: A cross sectional survey was conducted among patients registered to our centre with inherited bleeding disorders. A web-based based questionnaire was developed and shared with patients and families. RESULTS: 120 patients/ families answered the questionnaire completely. During the period of lockdown, many had bleeds that were left untreated due to either difficulty in travel or unavailability of treatment. The time to treatment ranged from 8 h to 15 days in those who had a bleed. 36 % faced financial difficulties and 40 % families reported losing their job or source of income during this period. DISCUSSION: Few solutions that emerged while treating patients during this period and recommendations are discussed. Even though haemophilia has been included under the essential health services and states mandated to continue treatment for these patients despite the global crisis, patients still face challenges in terms of transport and finance.","Radhakrishnan, Nita; Shankar, Ravi; Singh, Savitri; Rana, Megha",Transfus Apher Sci,50,24

Usually, RdRp domains are readily identifiable by comparative sequence analysis, but biochemical confirmation and characterization can be hampered by intrinsic protein properties and technical complications. It is presumed that replication and transcription of the ∼30-kb severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) RNA genome are catalyzed by an RdRp domain in the C-terminal part of nonstructural protein 12 (nsp12), one of 16 replicase subunits. However, thus far full-length nsp12 has proven refractory to expression in bacterial systems, which has hindered both the biochemical characterization of coronavirus RNA synthesis and RdRp-targeted antiviral drug design. Here, we describe a combined strategy involving bacterial expression of an nsp12 fusion protein and its in vivo cleavage to generate and purify stable SARS-CoV nsp12 (106 kDa) with a natural N-terminus and C-terminal hexahistidine tag. This recombinant protein possesses robust in vitro RdRp activity, as well as a significant DNA-dependent activity that may facilitate future inhibitor studies. The SARS-CoV nsp12 is primer dependent on both homo- and heteropolymeric templates, supporting the likeliness of a close enzymatic collaboration with the intriguing RNA primase activity that was recently proposed for coronavirus nsp8.","te Velthuis, Aartjan J.

To test the hypothesis that a simple incentive to self-prone for a maximum of 12 h per day would decrease oxygen needs in patients admitted to the ward for COVID-19 pneumonia on low-flow oxygen therapy. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Geneva University Hospitals were included in the study. Ten patients were randomised to self-prone positioning and 17 to usual care. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Oxygen needs assessed by oxygen flow on nasal cannula at inclusion were similar between groups. Twenty-four hours after starting the intervention, the median oxygen flow was 1.0 L·min(−1) (interquartile range, 0.1–2.9) in the prone position group and 2.0 L·min(−1) (interquartile range, 0.5–3.0) in the control group (p=0.507). Median oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio was 390 (interquartile range, 300–432) in the prone position group and 336 (interquartile range, 294–422) in the control group (p=0.633). One patient from the intervention group who did not self-prone was transferred to the high-dependency unit. Self-prone positioning was easy to implement. The intervention was well tolerated and only mild side-effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Self-prone positioning in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring low-flow oxygen therapy resulted in a clinically meaningful reduction of oxygen flow, but without reaching statistical significance.","Kharat, Aileen; Dupuis-Lozeron, Elise; Cantero, Chloé; Marti, Christophe; Grosgurin, Olivier; Lolachi, Sanaz; Lador, Frédéric; Plojoux, Jérôme; Janssens, Jean-Paul; Soccal, Paola M.; Adler, Dan",ERJ Open Res,50,24

We were interested in exploring the individual (i.e. sense of coherence) as well as the social and national resources (i.e. social support, sense of national coherence, and trust in governmental institutions) that could explain levels of mental health and anxiety during the outbreak of the pandemic. Data collection was conducted via convenience sampling on online platforms, during the end of March and the beginning of April 2020. The data included four samples: 640 Israeli participants (319 males), 622 Dutch participants (177 males), 924 Italian participants (338 males) and 489 Spanish participants (117 males); age range of 18–88 years. The questionnaires included standard tools (MHC-SF, GAD-7, SOC, SONC). Several questions were adapted to the context of coronavirus and measured levels of exposure to COVID-19, trust in governmental institutions, and social support. The results significantly confirmed the suggested salutogenic model regarding the contribution to individual and national coping resources to anxiety levels and mental health. The patterns of the coping resources in explaining anxiety and mental health were similar in the four samples, and SOC was the main predictor these outcomes. Despite these similarities, a different pattern and also different magnitudes of the predictive value of the coping resources were found for the two different reactions: anxiety vs. mental health. While SOC and situational factors (like financial threat) were significant in explaining anxiety levels, the SOC and national resources were found as significant in explaining mental health levels. The findings support the salutogenic approach in studying reactions during pandemic time. They also shed some light on the difference between pathogenic and salutogenic measures in studying psychological reactions to stressful situations.","Mana, Adi; Super, Sabina; Sardu, Claudia; Juvinya Canal, Dolors; Moran, Neuman; Sagy, Shifra",Glob Health Promot,50,19

Design and Setting: A national longitudinal survey using a framework based on evidence-based behaviour change models. The survey was administered to a national sample representative across sex, age and location was undertaken at two time points: May 1st to 5th, 2020, and July 1st to 7th, 2020. Results: Overall 2,056 surveys were completed across the first and second rounds, with 63% (1,296/2,056) completing both. Age range was 18–99 years (median 53, IQR: 34–64). Suboptimal physical distancing and self-quarantining if unwell/diagnosed was reported in one in four respondents and not getting a test at onset of symptoms reported in one in three. Those non-adherent to all three behaviours (19%, 60/323), were mainly male, younger, lived in major cities and reported fewer concerns or motivators to change behaviour. Overall, government lockdown measures were considered very important by 81% (835/1,032) and appropriate by 75% (772/1,029). Conclusions: Prior to the suppression of a second COVID-19 wave, a significant minority of Australians reported suboptimal behavioural adherence to vital policy strategies to limit SARS-CoV-2 spread, mostly young adults and men. Successful wave 2 suppression required consistent communication from political and health leaders and supportive public health and economic strategies. Additional lockdown and punitive strategies were needed in Victoria and were generally well-supported and adhered to. To limit subsequent lockdown, this work reinforces the need for a mix of communication around saving lives of the vulnerable, and other strategies targeting high risk groups, facilitation of easy testing and minimisation of financial impacts.","Enticott, Joanne; Slifirski, William; Lavoie, Kim L.; Bacon, Simon L.; Teede, Helena J.; Boyle, Jacqueline A.",Front Public Health,50,5

Due to the unbounded global spread of the disease, having biosensors with high performance such as high sensitivity and accuracy is of utmost importance. In this paper, the effects of various parameters on the behaviors of micro-biosensors are investigated in order to enhance their performance. These parameters are related to the geometry and material, and they are assumed to be gradually changing in the longitudinal direction of the biosensor according to a power law. Therefore, they are called functionally graded geometrical and material parameters. Another aspect is when considering microcantilever-based biosensors, the main behavior parameter is the deflection at the free end. In the analyses, the influences of the surface stress and van der Waals intermolecular forces are taken into account. Also, the total energy of the beam, which is the combination of the van der Waals energy and the elastic strain energy, is accomplished. In addition, the equivalent force causing the deflection is also evaluated using Castigliano method for two cases. These cases account for a concentrated force at the free end and a distributed load along the biosensor, respectively. Since the governing equations account for the size dependency and the considered parameters are functions of the position, the solution is too complex to be achieved analytically, and therefore, numerical methods are applied. For uniform biosensors made of homogeneous materials, or in other words when all parameters are not varying with the position, the obtained results are compared with those in the literature, and good agreement is obtained. On the other hand, the performance, which include sensitivity and limit of detection, of functionally graded biosensors can be enhanced by proper choices of the considered parameters and the corresponding exponent of the gradation function.","Shabana, Yasser M.; Samy, Mohamed A.; Abdel-Aziz, Mohamed A.; Hindawi, Mohamed E.; Mosry, Mohamed G.; Albarawy, Abdul-Rahman M.; Omar, Mazen M.; Mohamed, Ayman A.; Attia, Ahmed A.",Arch Appl Mech,50,1

As only very limited therapeutic options are clinically available, there is an urgent need for the rapid development of safe, effective, and globally available pharmaceuticals that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry and ameliorate COVID-19. In this study, we explored the use of small compounds acting on the homeostasis of the endolysosomal host-pathogen interface, to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection. We find that fluoxetine, a widely used antidepressant and a functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMA), efficiently inhibited the entry and propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in the cell culture model without cytotoxic effects and also exerted potent antiviral activity against two currently circulating influenza A virus subtypes, an effect which was also observed upon treatment with the FIASMAs amiodarone and imipramine. Mechanistically, fluoxetine induced both impaired endolysosomal acidification and the accumulation of cholesterol within the endosomes. As the FIASMA group consists of a large number of small compounds that are well-tolerated and widely used for a broad range of clinical applications, exploring these licensed pharmaceuticals may offer a variety of promising antivirals for host-directed therapy to counteract enveloped viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and COVID 19.","Schloer, Sebastian; Brunotte, Linda; Goretzko, Jonas; Mecate-Zambrano, Angeles; Korthals, Nadia; Gerke, Volker; Ludwig, Stephan; Rescher, Ursula",bioRxiv,50,16

The dynamic range and lowest detected quantity was determined using a SARS-CoV-2 partial N gene RNA transcript dilution series (100,000–1 copy/μl) and verified using 72 nose and throat swabs, 29 of which tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: Assay C consistently detected the lowest quantity of partial N gene RNA transcript with all mastermixes. The Takara One Step PrimeScript™ III RT-PCR Kit mastermix enabled all primer pairs to detect the entire dynamic range evaluated, with the Qiagen Quantifast and Thermofisher TaqPath 1-Step kits also performing well. Sequences from all three primer/probe sets tested in this study (assay A, B and C) have 100 % homology to ≥97 % of the of SARS-CoV-2 sequences available up to 31st December 2020 (n = 291,483 sequences). CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates that specific assays (in this case assay C) can perform well in terms of dynamic range and lowest detected quantity regardless of the mastermix used. However we also show that, by choosing the most appropriate mastermix, poorer performing primer pairs are also able to detect all of the template dilutions investigated. This work increases the potential options when choosing assays for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and provides solutions to enable them to work with optimal analytical sensitivity.","Brown, Julianne R.; O’Sullivan, Denise M.; Shah, Divya; Atkinson, Laura; Pereira, Rui P.A.; Whale, Alexandra S.; Busby, Eloise J.; Huggett, Jim F.; Harris, Kathryn",J Virol Methods,50,6

DATA SOURCES: PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases. STUDY SELECTION: This review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Protocol. DATA EXTRACTION: Using the Boolean method and relevant search term combinations for terms “mastoid,” “middle ear,” “virus,” “exposure” “COVID-19” “SARS-CoV-2.” PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases were queried. A total of 57 abstracts were identified and screened by two independent reviewers. Following inclusion and exclusion criteria, 18 studies were selected for the final analysis. DATA SYNTHESIS: Due to the heterogeneity of clinical data, a meta-analysis was not feasible. RESULTS: Rhinovirus, followed by respiratory syncytial virus are reported to be the most prevalent viruses in MEF samples but formal statistical analysis is precluded by the heterogeneity of the studies. Drilling was identified to have the highest risk for aerosol generation and therefore viral exposure during otologic Surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The medical literature has consistently demonstrated the presence of nucleic acids of respiratory viruses involving the middle ear, including SARS-CoV2 in a recent postmortem study. Although no in vivo studies have been conducted, due to the likely risk of transmission, middle ear and mastoid procedures, particularly involving the use of a drill should be deferred, if possible, during the pandemic and enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) used if surgery is necessary.","Liaw, Jeffrey; Saadi, Robert; Patel, Vijay A.; Isildak, Huseyin",Otol Neurotol,50,20

Several very recent papers contributed to explaining the key cellular steps occurring in the olfactory epithelium leading to anosmia/hyposmia (collectively known as dysosmia) initiated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this Viewpoint, we discuss current progress in research on olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 and we also propose an updated model of the SARS-CoV-2-induced dysosmia. The emerging central role of sustentacular cells and inflammatory processes in the olfactory epithelium are particularly considered. The proposed model of anosmia in COVID-19 does not answer unequivocally whether the new coronavirus exploits the olfactory route to rapidly or slowly reach the brain in COVID-19 patients.

The beneficial effects of regular physical activity are well established yet to the authors' knowledge, no research addresses the cancellation of all recreational provisions. Using quantitative and qualitative methods, this study assessed the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on recreational sports players, what alternative exercise methods have been sought and how players feel about returning to their sport. METHOD: An online survey was distributed across England for six-weeks commencing in May 2020. A questionnaire explored differences in the impact of COVID-19 restrictions between sex, winter/summer/year-round sports, team/individual sports, age, and resilience groups. The use of alternative exercise methods, coping strategies and feelings about returning to sport were also investigated. Responses were gathered from 2023 adults whose recreational sport had been cancelled by COVID-19. All completed questionnaires (n = 1213) were taken for analysis (mean age = 49.41 years, SD = 17.165, 55.2% female). RESULTS: Quantitative findings showed the negative impact of COVID-19 restrictions was greater for females, those involved in winter and team sports, those aged 18–39 and low-resilient copers (p < .05). No significant differences were found between individuals that had had COVID-19 or were considered vulnerable by government guidelines. Acceptance was the most common coping strategy. The average number of days per week that participants exercised significantly increased during lockdown, with significant increases also seen in the use of online workouts, fitness apps and home-gym exercise. Qualitative findings suggested that participants are looking forward to the social and physical benefits of recreational activity restarting yet are concerned about the logistics of returning under social distancing restrictions. Other worries included loss of fitness, spreading (younger age groups) and catching (older age groups) COVID-19 and being in a crowd. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight what is currently accessible to home-based exercisers and inform the reintroduction of recreational sports clubs. As COVID-19 restrictions look to persist, club representatives should provide accessible home-exercise options and be cautious of participant concerns when considering the return of recreational sport.","Martin, Anna May; Champ, Francesca; Franklin, Zoe",Psychol Sport Exerc,50,5

Using our recently developed electron microscopy polyclonal epitope mapping approach, we have uncovered a phenomenon wherein off-target antibodies elicited by HIV trimer subunit vaccines cause the otherwise highly stabilized trimeric proteins to degrade into cognate protomers.

While e-learning has an advantage for students that they can attend to their courses from anywhere at their convenience, yet the sudden disruptive shift to e-learning during the pandemic saw students facing many challenges, which had strong ability to induce mental health issues among the students. This study aimed at examining the impact of COVID-19-induced e-learning on the university students’ stress perceptions in Oman. RESULTS: A total of 966 usable responses were received. The results showed that 96.9% (moderate stress = 82.5% and high stress = 14.4%) reported having experienced stress through e-learning during COVID-19. The results further indicated that there was a significant negative correlation between perceived stress and the students’ academic performance. The family support and institutional support were observed to have a significant effect on students’ stress perception. CONCLUSIONS: Students are away from the physical campuses over a year now, continuing their courses and programs online. The numerous challenges they are facing through e-learning, together with the prevailing uncertainty, have intensified stress among them. The continued stress over time will not only affect their academic performance, but their mental and physical health as well, as the stress has proven to be one of the major causes of various physical and mental disorders. While e-learning seems to emerge as a new normal, the students require proper attention, help, and support from their families and institutions.

To reduce the impact of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the Italian Government decision-makers issued a series of law decrees that imposed measures limiting social contacts, stopped non-essential production activities, and restructured public health care in order to privilege assistance to patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Health care services were substantially limited including planned hospitalization and elective surgeries. These substantial measures were criticized due to their impact on individual rights including freedom and autonomy, but were justified by the awareness that hospitals would have been unable to cope with the surge of infected people who needed treatment for COVID-19. The imbalance between the need to guarantee ordinary care and to deal with the pandemic, in a context of limited health resources, raises ethical concerns as well as clinical management issues. The emergency scenario caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the lockdown phase, led the Government and health care decision-makers to prioritize community safety above the individuals’ rights.

Persistence and spread of resistant strains within a population contribute to the maintenance of a reservoir and lead to treatment failure. An experimental trial was carried out to study the horizontal transmission of a fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli strain from inoculated to naïve pigs. All naïve contact pigs had positive counts of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli after only two days of contact. Moreover, re-infections of inoculated pigs caused by newly contaminated animals were suspected. A maximum likelihood method, based on a susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model, was used to determine the transmission parameters. Two transmission levels were identified depending on the quantity of bacteria shed by infected individuals: (i) low-shedders with bacterial counts of resistant E. coli in the faeces between 5*10(3 )and 10(6 )CFU/g (β(L )= 0.41 [0.27; 0.62]), (ii) high shedders with bacterial counts above 10(6 )CFU/g (β(H )= 0.98 [0.59; 1.62]).

The similarity of SARS and avian influenza prompted us to examine the relationship between SARS experience and preparedness on a potential avian influenza outbreak. METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was delivered to nurses in Hong Kong to assess their attitude towards avian influenza; risk perception, and their relationships with previous level of exposure to SARS patients. RESULTS: Nine hundred and ninety-nine respondents were included in data analysis. About half of them perceived there would be an avian influenza outbreak in Hong Kong. The majority accepted a personal risk of infection in the course of their work (72.7%), and prepared to take care of patients infected with avian influenza (84.0%). Respondents were classified into two groups: high exposure (44.1%) and low exposure (55.9%) as defined by having worked in SARS ward or hospitals. High exposure nurses were less likely to avoid patients, less inclined to change their job if they were required to take care of infected patients, and had therefore a more positive attitude towards an impending avian influenza epidemic. About half of the nurses had frequent involuntary recalls of incidents relating to SARS, the frequency of which was positively correlated with knowing a person suffering from long-term complications of SARS. CONCLUSION: Healthcare workers who had been actively involved in SARS work were more “positive” in responding to the impending avian influenza epidemic.

The cattle were infected through direct contact with an experimentally inoculated calf. All experimental cattle shed faecal BCV with development of diarrhoea, being profusely watery with small amounts of blood in the most severely affected animals, including both cows and calves. The cows, in contrast to the calves, showed depressed general condition and appetite leading to a marked decrease in milk yield. Further age-associated differences were a shorter incubation period in the two youngest calves, but with milder fever and milder decrease in white blood cell counts. These findings shed light on the apparent epidemiological differences between WD and calf BCV diarrhoea suggesting that, (1) the same strains of BCV cause natural outbreaks of calf diarrhoea and WD, (2) seronegative cows are more severely affected by the infection than seronegative conventionally reared calves, and (3) unaffected general condition in diarrhoeic calves may lead to underestimation of the occurrence of calf diarrhoea in WD outbreaks. In response to infection, all cattle produced early interferon type 1 in serum and, except for one calf, in nasal secretions. A finding not previously reported is the detection of interferon type 1 responses in bovine milk. All cattle developed high IgM antibody responses and long-lasting IgA antibody responses both systemically and locally. The serum IgM antibody responses came earlier in most of the calves than in the cows. Prolonged IgM antibody responses were detected in serum and milk, while those in nasal secretions were much shorter. BCV-specific IgA was present in nasal secretions from all cattle throughout the 6 months follow-up. The IgA antibody response in serum was detected up to 17 months post-infection and the duration showed an age-related variation indicating a more prominent IgA memory in the adult cattle and in the older calves than in the younger ones. BCV-specific IgG was detected in all cattle during the experimental period of up to 22 months. In conclusion, WD was reproduced in seronegative lactating cows. The cows showed a more severe general diseases than seronegative calves infected concurrently.
