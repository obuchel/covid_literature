17223,17223,17223,Pharmaceutical effluent: a critical link in the interconnected ecosystem promoting antimicrobial resistance,23.570059,7.3340063,2021-04-30,"BACKGROUND: A critical shortage of health workers with needed maternal and newborn competencies remains a major challenge for the provision of quality care for mothers and newborns, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Supply-side challenges related to human resources for health (HRH) worsen shortages and can negatively affect health worker performance and quality of care. This review scoped country-focused sources to identify and map evidence on HRH-related challenges to quality facility-based newborn care provision by nurses and midwives. METHODS: Evidence for this review was collected iteratively, beginning with pertinent World Health Organization documents and extending to articles identified via database and manual reference searches and country reports. Evidence from country-focused sources from 2000 onward was extracted using a data extraction tool that was designed iteratively; thematic analysis was used to map the 10 categories of HRH challenges. FINDINGS: A total of 332 peer-reviewed articles were screened, of which 22 met inclusion criteria. Fourteen additional sources were added from manual reference search and gray literature sources. Evidence has been mapped into 10 categories of HRH-related challenges: (1) lack of health worker data and monitoring; (2) poor health worker preservice education; (3) lack of HW access to evidence-based practice guidelines, continuing education, and continuing professional development; (4) insufficient and inequitable distribution of health workers and heavy workload; (5) poor retention, absenteeism, and rotation of experienced staff; (6) poor work environment, including low salary; (7) limited and poor supervision; (8) low morale, motivation, and attitude, and job dissatisfaction; (9) weaknesses of policy, regulations, management, leadership, governance, and funding; and (10) structural and contextual barriers. CONCLUSION: The mapping provides needed insight that informed new World Health Organization strategies and supporting efforts to address the challenges identified and strengthen human resources for neonatal care, with the ultimate goal of improving newborn care and outcomes.","Bolan, Nancy; Cowgill, Karen D.; Walker, Karen; Kak, Lily; Shaver, Theresa; Moxon, Sarah; Lincetto, Ornella",Glob Health Sci Pract,688,1

Herein, we report the isolation, identification, and bioactivity evaluation of Streptomyces sp. NMF6 associated with the marine sponge Diacarnus ardoukobae. RESULTS: Results showed that the strain belonged to the genus Streptomyces, and it was designated as Streptomyces sp. NMF6 with the GenBank accession number MW015111. Ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract of the strain NMF6 demonstrated a promising antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Vibrio damsela, and Candida albicans and a strong antioxidant activity, which were confirmed by DPPH, ferric-reducing power, and phosphomolybdenum assays; results are expressed as ascorbic acid equivalents. NMF6 extract also demonstrated cytotoxicity against breast cancer cell line (MCF-7), hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (Hep-G2), and human colon carcinoma cell line (HCT-116); the selectivity index values were < 2. The extract showed promising antiviral activity against HSV-1, CoxB4, and hepatitis A viruses at concentrations that were nontoxic to the host cells, with the selectivity index values being 13.25, 9.42, and 8.25, respectively. GC-MS analysis of the extract showed the presence of 20 compounds, with bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate being the major component (48%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that the marine sponge–associated Streptomyces sp. NMF6 strain is a potential source of bioactive compounds that could be developed into therapeutic agents.","Fahmy, Nayer Mohamed; Abdel-Tawab, Asmaa Mohamed",J Genet Eng Biotechnol,688,1

Our previous study found that MLIF protects against ischemic stroke in rats and mice and exerts a neuroprotection effect in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Microglia/macrophage polarization has been proven to be vital in the pathology of ischemic stroke. Nevertheless, whether MLIF is able to modulate microglia/macrophage polarization remains unclear. We performed middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) on C57BL/6J male mice and induced cultured BV2 microglia by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), respectively. Immunfluorescence was utilized to detect the M1/2 markers, such as CD206 and CD16/32. qPCR and ELISA were used to detect the signature gene change of M1/2. The MAPK and NF-κB pathway associated proteins were measured by Western blot. To identify the protein target of MLIF, a pull-down assay was performed. We found that MLIF promoted microglia transferring from a “sick” M1 phenotype to a “healthy” M2 phenotype in vivo or in vitro. Furthermore, we proved that eukaryotic elongation factor 1A1 (eEF1A1) was involved in the modulation of microglia/macrophage polarization. Knocking down eEF1A1 by siRNA exhibited the M1 promotion effect and M2 inhibition effect. Taken together, our results demonstrated MLIF modulated microglia/macrophage polarization by targeting eEF1A1 in ischemic stroke.","Liu, Yulan; Deng, Shanshan; Song, Zhibing; Zhang, Qian; Guo, Yuchen; Yu, Yongsheng; Wang, Yuliang; Li, Tiejun; Megahed, Fayed A.

While many surveys have been conducted, most are focused on drinking changes in the general population and validation with biological markers is lacking. METHOD We performed a retrospective cohort study among patients with AUD attending a urine drug screening program. With mixed-effects logistic regression models, we assessed the probability of screening positive for ethyl glucuronide according to patients' main clinical characteristics and time of analysis (either prior to or after a lockdown was implemented in Spain). RESULTS A total of 362 patients provided 2,040 urine samples (1,295 prior to lockdown, 745 during lockdown). The mean age of participants was 52.0 years (SD 12.6), and 69.2% were men. Of the 43% of patients tested for other drugs 22% screened positive. After adjusting for all covariates, the odds of screening positive for ethyl glucuronide during lockdown almost doubled (OR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.33, p = 0.008). Other significant covariates included testing positive for other drugs (OR = 10.79, 95% CI 4.60 to 26.97) and length of treatment (OR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.74). CONCLUSIONS Our data support an association between the lockdown due to COVID-19 and increased alcohol use in patients with AUD. Thus, addiction healthcare systems could face significant challenges ahead. In light of these findings, it is essential to evaluate prospectively how patients with AUD are affected by the pandemic and how health systems respond to their needs.","Barrio, Pablo; Baldaquí, Nuria; Andreu, Magalí; Kilian, Carolin; Rehm, Jürgen; Gual, Antoni; Manthey, Jakob","Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",688,1

A structured questionnaire containing 10 questions was used, and each question had 2 or 3 possible answers. The parents of children (aged 0-14 years) who visited the dental department of our hospital last year were eligible to participate in this study. A total of 148 parents were interviewed by telephone in February 2020 by research staff. A total of 94.59% of the parents said they paid high attention to COVID-19 and explained it to their children; 66.22% thought the dental department environment was more dangerous than other public places; 91.89% believed the dental department had a higher risk of virus infection; and 83.78% said they would take their children to a dental department if the children had a severe toothache. Approximately 81.08% of the parents expressed confidence after we informed them about the preventive measures taken in the dental department to ensure safe treatment for their children. In conclusion, all parents were concerned about COVID-19, and most of them had talked about it with their children often. In addition, a considerable percentage of them would not take their children to the dental department even if they had severe dental pain and thought that the dental environment could be more dangerous than other environments.

Here, human programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) peptides were used for the first time for the modification of gold nanoprisms (GNPs) to enhance targeting efficiency. A multifunctional nanoprobe was developed that the GNPs@PEG/Ce6-PD-L1 peptide (GNPs@PEG/Ce6-P) was used for imaging-guided photothermal/ photodynamic therapy by using the targeting effect of PD-L1. Both confocal imaging and flow cytometry experiments demonstrated a remarkable affinity of the as-prepared nanoprobes GNPs@PEG/Ce6-P to lung cancer cells (HCC827), which have a high PD-L1 expression. Subsequent in vitro and in vivo experiments further demonstrated that the nanoprobes GNPs@PEG/Ce6-P not only allowed for real-time visualization via fluorescence (FL) imaging and photoacoustic (PA) imaging, but also served as phototherapy agents for synergistic photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Furthermore, treatments on human lung cancer cells-derived tumors demonstrated that the nanoprobes GNPs@PEG/Ce6-P could significantly suppress tumor growth through PTT and PDT from GNPs and Ce6, respectively. In conclusion, the as-prepared new nanoprobes show promising potential for nanomedicine with remarkable targeting ability for dual-mode imaging and enhanced PDT and PTT effects on lung cancer.","Liu, Bin; Qiao, Guanglei; Han, Yu; Shen, E; Alfranca, Gabriel; Tan, Haisong; Wang, Lirui; Pan, Shaojun; Ma, Lijun; Xiong, Wujun; Liu, Yanlei; Cui, Daxiang",Acta biomaterialia,688,7

IFN-alpha SC were characterized by an ELISPOT assay on non-adherent PBMC following incubation with the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus. In vitro irradiation of PBMC was followed by a decrease in the number of IFN-alpha SC while IFN-gamma production and cell viability were not affected. These data indicate that porcine IFN-alpha SC are relatively radiosensitive. Indeed, the frequency of blood IFN-alpha SC decreased markedly and rapidly after in vivo whole body or partial lymphoid irradiation. In addition, within several days of compatible bone-marrow engraftment in the irradiated animals, the number of blood IFN-alpha SC returned to normal values. These data demonstrate that circulating porcine IFN-alpha SC are derived from bone-marrow progenitors.","Charley, B; Nowacki, W; Vaiman, M",Veterinary research,688,33

The increasing frequency of emergence of the highly pathogenic H5N1, H7N3 and H7N7 influenza viruses and the panzootic spread of H9N2 influenza virus, all of which can be potentially transmitted to humans, are of great concern to both veterinary and human public health officials. The question is how soon the next pandemic will emerge. A convergence of factors, including the population densities of poultry, pigs and humans, are likely factors affecting the evolution of the virus. Highly concentrated poultry and pig farming, in conjunction with traditional live animal or 'wet' markets, provide optimal conditions for increased mutation, reassortment and recombination of influenza viruses. Strategies to reduce the evolution of influenza and the emergence of pandemics include the separation of species, increased biosecurity, the development of new vaccine strategies and better basic knowledge of the virus. More effective co-operation between scientists and veterinary and public health officials is required to achieve these goals.","Webster, R G; Hulse, D J",Revue scientifique et technique,688,28

A rapid, reliable diagnostic assay is needed for monitoring the spread of the disease. Here we report a method for eliminating false-negative results and increasing test sensitivity, based on the hypothesis that the message encoded by the nucleocapsid (N) gene is the most abundant during viral infection. Nasopharyngeal aspirates and stool samples were obtained from suspected SARS patients with major clinical symptoms and a significant history of close contact with infected patients. Total RNAs were extracted in a 96-well format, together with pig kidney epithelial (PK-15) cells as an internal control for extraction efficiency. PCR inhibitors were removed by ethanol precipitation, and a PCR for the pig beta-actin gene was used as a positive control for all clinical samples. Samples were analyzed by a reverse transcriptase PCR assay. Northern blot analysis was performed to demonstrate differences in subgenomic transcripts of the virus, and a real-time quantitative PCR was employed to compare the sensitivities of two loci (1b and N). The detection rate of the assay reached 44.4% on day 9 after the onset of the disease. The diagnostic PCR amplifying the N gene gave an average of a 26.0% (6.3 to 60.0%) stronger intensity signal than that for the 1b gene. In conclusion, the nucleocapsid gene represents an additional sensitive molecular marker for the diagnosis of the SARS coronavirus and can be further adapted for use in a high-throughput platform assay.","Hui, Raymond K H; Zeng, Fanya; Chan, Charis M N; Yuen, K Y; Peiris, Joseph S M; Leung, Frederick C C",Journal of clinical microbiology,688,17

Interactions between pre-pandemic disgust proneness and current perceived stress were tested to examine a diathesis-stress model of the role of disgust proneness in anxiety response to the pandemic. Increased pre-pandemic disgust proneness predicted increased coronavirus anxiety and safety behaviors, controlling for number of COVID-19 cases by state. Consistent with a diathesis-stress model, current perceived stress moderated this effect, such that highest coronavirus anxiety and safety behaviors were reported by those with high disgust proneness and high stress. Trait disgust proneness may be a vulnerability factor for anxiety responses to the coronavirus pandemic, particularly among individuals experiencing high stress.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the characteristics of patients with a hip fracture following a fall during the COVID-19 pandemic year and during the preceding year. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of older patients who had undergone surgery for hip fracture repair in a major 495-bed hospital located in northern central Israel following a fall. Characteristics of patients who had been hospitalized in 2020 (pandemic year, n=136) and in 2019 (non-pandemic year, n=151) were compared. RESULTS: During the pandemic year, patients were less likely to have fallen in a nursing facility, to have had muscle or balance problems, and to have had a history of falls and fractures following a fall. Moreover, the average length of stay (LOS) in the hospital was shorter;however, the average time from the injury to hospitalization was longer. Patients were less likely to have acquired a postoperative infection or to have died. During the pandemic year, postoperative infection was only associated with prolonged LOS. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic may have had a positive impact on the behavior of older adults as well as on the management of hip fracture patients. However, healthcare providers should be aware of the possible reluctance to seek care during a pandemic. Moreover, further research on the impact of the change in management during COVID-19 on hip fracture survival is warranted.","Steinfeld, Y.; Ben Natan, M.; Yonai, Y.; Berkovich, Y.",Isr Med Assoc J,688,32

Amino acids are ubiquitous as dissolved nitrogenous organic matter in source water and can pass through drinking water treatment processes to react with disinfectants in finished water and in the distribution system. Phenylalanine (Phe) was selected as a model amino acid precursor to investigate its derived DBPs and their variations during a chlorination regime that simulated water distribution with residue chlorine. The 7-day DBPs formation potential (DBPsFP) test with chlorine revealed chlorination by-products of phenylalanine including trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), haloacetonitriles (HANs), and halonitromethanes (HNMs), but not trichloronitromethane (TCNM) which was a significant N-DBP detected during the first 48 h of chlorine contact. The formation of most carbonaceous DBPs (C-DBPs) increased with chlorination time; however N-DBPs and non-chlorinated byproducts of phenylacetonitrile and phenylacetaldehyde reached their highest concentration after 2 h of reaction, and then gradually decreased until below detection after 7 days. The chlorination influencing factors indicated that light enhanced the peak yield of DBPs; the pH value showed different influences associated with corresponding DBPs; and the presence of bromide ions (Br-) generated a variety of bromine-containing DBPs. The DBPsFP test with chloramine reduced C-DBPs generation to about 1/3 of the level observed for chlorine disinfection and caused an increase in dichloroacetonitrile. Surveillance of DBPs during drinking water distribution to consumers should consider the varying contact times with disinfectants to accurately profile the types and concentrations of C-DBPs and N-DBPs present in drinking water.","Zhou, Kejin; Ye, Sheng; Yu, Qi; Chen, Jingji; Yong, Pang; Ma, Xiaoyan; Li, Qingsong; Dietrich, Andrea M",Sci Total Environ,688,33

Furthermore, recent advanced systems allow controlled expression of the effector RNA via coexpression of a tetracycline/doxycycline (DOX) responsive repressor (tTR-KRAB). Herein, this system was utilized to assess the antiviral effects of LV-encoded shRNAs targeting three conserved regions on the pregenomic RNA of hepatitis B virus (HBV), namely the region coding for the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain of the viral polymerase (LV-HBV-shRNA1), the core promoter (CP; LV-HBV-shRNA2), and the direct repeat 1 (DR1; LV-HBV-shRNA3). Transduction of just the LV-HBV-shRNA vectors into the stably HBV expressing HepG2.2.15 cell line showed significant reductions in secreted HBsAg and HBeAg, intracellular HBcAg as well as HBV RNA and DNA replicative intermediates for all vectors, however, most pronouncedly for the DR1-targeting shRNA3. The corresponding vector was therefore applied in the DOX-controlled system. Notably, strong interference with HBV replication was found in the presence of the inducer DOX whereas the antiviral effect was essentially ablated in its absence; hence, the silencing effect of the shRNA and consequently HBV replication could be strictly regulated by DOX. This newly established system may therefore provide a valuable platform to study the antiviral efficacy of RNA drugs against HBV in a regulated manner, and even be applicable in vivo.

In this study, we evaluate whether EVLWI is higher in patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS as compared to COVID-19 negative, ventilated patients with ARDS and whether EVLWI has the potential to monitor disease progression. EVLWI and cardiac function were monitored by transpulmonary thermodilution in 25 patients with COVID-19 ARDS subsequent to intubation and compared to a control group of 49 non-COVID-19 ARDS patients. At intubation, EVLWI was noticeably elevated and significantly higher in COVID-19 patients than in the control group (17 (11–38) vs. 11 (6–26) mL/kg; p < 0.001). High pulmonary vascular permeability index values (2.9 (1.0–5.2) versus 1.9 (1.0–5.2); p = 0.003) suggested a non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. By contrast, the cardiac parameters SVI, GEF and GEDVI were comparable in both cohorts. High EVLWI values were associated with viral persistence, prolonged intensive care treatment and in-hospital mortality (23.2 ± 6.7% vs. 30.3 ± 6.0%, p = 0.025). Also, EVLWI showed a significant between-subjects (r = − 0.60; p = 0.001) and within-subjects correlation (r = − 0.27; p = 0.028) to Horowitz index. Compared to non COVID-19 ARDS, COVID-19 results in markedly elevated EVLWI-values in patients with ARDS. High EVLWI reflects a non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in COVID-19 ARDS and could serve as parameter to monitor ARDS progression on ICU.","Rasch, Sebastian; Schmidle, Paul; Sancak, Sengül; Herner, Alexander; Huberle, Christina; Schulz, Dominik; Mayr, Ulrich; Schneider, Jochen; Spinner, Christoph D.; Geisler, Fabian; Schmid, Roland M.; Lahmer, Tobias; Huber, Wolfgang",Sci Rep,688,1

Although vaccines have been developed, antiviral therapy is an important complement that cannot be substituted. Because of the lack of specific approved treatment, it is urgent to facilitate the cascade of further understanding of the infection biology, identification of druggable targets and the final development of effective antiviral therapies. PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway plays a vital role in regulating the infection course of many viruses. In this study, we have dissected the effects of PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway on rotavirus infection using both conventional cell culture models and a 3D model of human primary intestinal organoids. We found that PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling is essential in sustaining rotavirus infection. Thus, blocking the key elements of this pathway, including PI3K, mTOR and 4E-BP1, has resulted in potent anti-rotavirus activity. Importantly, a clinically used mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, potently inhibited both experimental and patient-derived rotavirus strains. This effect involves 4E-BP1 mediated induction of autophagy, which in turn exerts anti-rotavirus effects. These results revealed new insights on rotavirus-host interactions and provided new avenues for antiviral drug development.","Yin, Yuebang; Dang, Wen; Zhou, Xinying; Xu, Lei; Wang, Wenshi; Cao, Wanlu; Chen, Sunrui; Su, Junhong; Cai, Xuepeng; Xiao, Shaobo; Peppelenbosch, Maikel P.; Pan, Qiuwei",Virulence,688,1

This disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2 that was identified in Chinese patients having severe pneumonia and flu-like symptoms. COVID-19 is a contagious disease that spreads rapidly via droplet particles arising through sneezing and coughing action of an infected person. The reports of asymptomatic carriers changed the scenario of symptom based-diagnosis in COVID-19 and intensified the need for proper diagnosis of the majority of the population to combat the rapid transmission of virus. The diagnosis of positive cases is necessary to ensure prompt care to affected people and also to curb further spread of infection in the population. Collecting samples at the right time and from the exact anatomical site is crucial for proper molecular diagnosis. After the complete genome sequence was available, China formulated RT-PCR as a primary diagnostic procedure for detecting SARS-CoV-2. Many in-house and commercial diagnostic kits have been developed or are under development that have a potential to lower the burden of diagnosis on the primary diagnostic techniques like RT-PCR. Serological based diagnosis is another broad category of testing that can detect different serum antibodies like IgG, IgM, and IgA in an infected patient. PCR-based diagnostic procedures that are commonly used for pathogen detection need sophisticated machines and assistance of a technical expert. Despite their reliable accuracy, they are not cost-effective tests, which a common man can afford, so it becomes imperative to look for other diagnostic approaches, which could be cost effective, rapid, and sensitive with consistent accuracy. To make such diagnostics available to the common man, many techniques can be exploited among, which are Point of Care (POC), also known as bed side testing, which is developing as a portable and promising tool in pathogen diagnosis. Other lateral flow assay (LFA)-based techniques like SHERLOCK, CRISPR-Cas12a (AIOD-CRISPR), and FNCAS9 editor-limited uniform detection assay (FELUDA), etc. have shown promising results in rapid detection of pathogens. Diagnosis holds a critical importance in the pandemic situation when there is no potential drug for the pathogen available in the market. This review sums up the different diagnostic approaches designed or proposed to combat the crisis of widespread diagnosis due to the sudden outbreak of a novel pathogen, SARS-CoV-2 in 2019.","Islam, Khursheed Ul; Iqbal, Jawed",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,688,26

AIMS: This study aims to describe (1) the characteristics of patients who accessed inpatient treatment, (2) the length of inpatient stay and readmissions, and (3) the quality and safety of care as indicated by the type of admission (voluntary/compulsory) and seclusion use during the lockdown period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this comparative database study conducted at North West Area Mental Health Service, the study group included patients who had an admission between March 16, 2020 (starting of social distancing measures in Victoria) and May 12, 2020 (when easing [Stage 1] of social restrictions started). The control group included patients admitted between March 16, 2019, and May 12, 2019. The hospital databases were sources of information. RESULTS: The study and control groups included 104 and 109 patients, respectively. Compared to the control group, the study group had significantly more patients with separated relationship status, a lower number of severe mental illnesses (SMIs), a higher number of substance use disorders, and lower readmissions. A subanalysis within the lockdown period showed more voluntary admissions in the initial phase whereas more compulsory admissions in the later phase at trend significance. CONCLUSION: Patients with a separated relationship status and a substance use disorder sought inpatient treatment more than others. Aside from exploring the reasons for these findings, it is also important to investigate why SMIs and readmissions decreased during the lockdown period through further studies.","Itrat, Annie; Jagadheesan, Karuppiah; Danivas, Vijay; Lakra, Vinay",Indian J Psychiatry,688,16

It occurs in 30%–55% of patients with hip fractures and is one of the most common postoperative complications in older adults undergoing orthopaedic surgery. Multicomponent, non-pharmacological interventions can reduce delirium incidence by up to 30% but are often challenging to implement as part of routine care. We identified a gap in the delivery of non-pharmacological interventions on an orthopaedic unit. This project aimed to implement a bedside sign on an orthopaedic unit to reduce the occurrence of delirium by prompting staff to use multicomponent evidence-based delirium prevention strategies for at-risk older adults. Quality improvement methods were used to integrate and optimise the use of a bedside ‘delirium prevention’ sign on an orthopaedic unit. The sign was implemented in four target rooms and sign completion rates increased from 47% to 83% (95% CI 71.7% to 94.9%; p<0.001) over a 10-month period. The sign did not have a significant impact on delirium prevalence. The mean Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)+ rate during the baseline period was 8% with an absolute increase in the intervention period to 11.4% (95% CI 7.2% to 15.8%; p=0.31). There were no significant shifts or trends in the run chart for the proportion of patients with CAM+ scores over time. The sign was well received by staff, who reported it was a worthwhile use of time and prompted use of non-pharmacological interventions. This quality improvement project successfully integrated a novel, low-cost, feasible and evidence-based approach into routine clinical care to support staff to deliver non-pharmacological interventions. Given the increased pressures on front-line staff in hospital, tools that reduce cognitive load at the bedside are important to consider when caring for a vulnerable older adult patient population.","Reppas-Rindlisbacher, Christina; Siddhpuria, Shailee; Wong, Eric Kai-Chung; Lee, Justin Yusen; Gabor, Christopher; Curkovic, Alexandra; Khalili, Yasmin; Mavrak, Caroline; De Freitas, Sandra; Eshak, Kristeen; Patterson, Christopher",BMJ Open Qual,688,16

We have extensively optimized the conditions for SARS-CoV-2 infection and demonstrated the great flexibility of iPA detection using several antibodies and dual-probing with two distinct epitope-specific antibodies. In addition, we showed that iPA could be utilized for ultra-high-throughput viral titration and neutralization assay within 24 h and is amenable to a 384-well format.

Porcine DCoV has since spread worldwide and is associated with multiple outbreaks of diarrheal disease of variable severity in farmed pigs. In contrast, avian DCoV is being reported in wild birds in different countries without any evidence of disease. The DCoV transboundary nature and the recent discovery of its remarkably broad reactivity with its cellular receptor–aminopeptidase N (APN)–from different species emphasize its epidemiological relevance and necessitate additional research. Further, the ability of porcine DCoV to infect and cause disease in chicks and turkey poults and gnotobiotic calves is suggestive of its increased potential for interspecies transmission or of its avian origin. Whether, porcine DCoVs were initially acquired by one or several mammalian species from birds and whether avian and porcine DCoVs continue co-evolving with frequent spillover events remain to be major unanswered questions. In this review, we will discuss the current information on the prevalence, genetic diversity, and pathogenic potential of porcine and avian DCoVs. We will also analyze the existing evidence of the ongoing interspecies transmission of DCoVs that may provide novel insights into their complex evolution.","Vlasova, Anastasia N.; Kenney, Scott P.; Jung, Kwonil; Wang, Qiuhong; Saif, Linda J.",Front Vet Sci,688,24

In New Zealand during the most restrictive alert level (Level 4), roadside concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) were reduced 48–54% compared to Business-as-usual (BAU) values. NO(2) concentrations rapidly returned to near mean levels as the alert levels decreased and restrictions eased. PM(10) and PM(2.5) responded differently to NO(2) during the different alert levels. This is due to particulates having multiple sources, many of natural origin and therefore less influenced by human activity. PM(10) and PM(2.5) concentrations were reduced during alert level 4 but to a lesser extent than NO(2) and with more variability across regions. Particulate concentrations increased notably during alert level 2 when many airsheds reported concentrations above the BAU means. To provide robust BAU reference concentrations, simple 5-year means were calculated along with predictions from machine learning modelling that, in effect, removed the influence of meteorology on observed concentrations. The results of this study show that latter method was found to be more closely aligned to observed values for NO(2) as well as PM(2.5) and PM(10) away from coastal regions.","Talbot, Nick; Takada, Akika; Bingham, Andrew H.; Elder, Dan; Lay Yee, Samantha; Golubiewski, Nancy E.",Atmos Environ (1994),688,10

COVID-19 pandemic control measures affect the prevalence of other respiratory viruses. Effects on some viruses have been described; however, the broader impact and temporal relationship of control measures on virus decline and subsequent re-emergence have not been thoroughly documented. Understanding these phenomena may influence health policies. Objective. To examine the prevalence of unrelated respiratory viruses in relation to population-wide pandemic response measures and phases in 2020 in Singapore. Design, Setting, and Participants. Data from respiratory multiplex PCRs from 3 major hospitals (total 3700 beds) in Singapore were collated. The full dataset consisted of 42,558 test results, 19,898 from 2019 and 22,660 from 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures. Weekly virus prevalence data were mapped onto prevailing pandemic response measures, in order to elucidate temporal relationships and differential virus responses. Pre-pandemic data from 2019 were compared with data from 2020. Results. Early response measures, even before national lockdown, were followed by a dramatic reduction of influenza viruses and a more gradual decline of other respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, endemic coronaviruses and metapneumovirus. Marked decline of enterovirus/rhinovirus and adenovirus, however, was only observed during lockdown. About 13 weeks into phased reopening, enterovirus/rhinovirus re-emerged, followed by adenovirus, the latter mainly in the pediatric population. All other viruses remained at low levels until the end of 2020. Conclusions and Relevance. COVID-19 control measures in Singapore had a significant impact on a broad range of respiratory viruses. Effects of various control measures varied between phases and different viruses. Influenza viruses declined earliest and most dramatically; relaxation of measures was followed by re-emergence of enterovirus/rhinovirus and adenovirus. These patterns are presumably a result of different propensities for contact versus droplet and overall ease of transmission, and different virus reservoirs. Further studies into these phenomena are a matter of public health importance.","Wan, W. Y.; Thoon, K. C.; Loo, L. H.; Chan, K. S.; Oon, L. L. E.; Ramasamy, A.; Maiwald, M.",,688,16

Due to the inconvenience and difficulty of preparing SEDs from some patients, producing SEDs from allogeneic blood donations is gaining popularity. A major safety concern associated with allogeneic blood is virus transmission. We therefore herein evaluated the possibility of applying a solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment to inactivate viruses and studied the impacts of such treatment of SEDs to resolve DES in a rabbit model. Sera prepared from the blood of five rabbits were pooled and divided into two sub-pools. One was untreated (SEDs), while the other was virally-inactivated with 1% Tri-n-butyl phosphate/1% Triton X-45 at 31°C for 1 h (S/D-SEDs). DES was induced in rabbits using 0.1% benzalkonium chloride (BAC). Rabbits were divided into five groups of two rabbits each. One group was untreated (control), three were treated twice daily for 3 weeks using PBS, SEDs, or S/D-SEDs, and the last received an additional 0.1% BAC (as the negative control). The DES condition was determined by measuring aqueous tear secretion (Schirmer’s test), corneal fluorescein staining, a corneal histologic examination, TUNEL stain apoptosis, and corneal inflammatory marker (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-8, and IL-6) expressions. We first confirmed that SEDs and S/D-SEDs had similar protein profiles and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β contents. Animal experiments showed that tear secretion did not significantly differ between the SED and S/D-SED groups but was significantly higher than in the PBS group. Eye fluorescein staining revealed dramatic improvements in epithelial defects in groups treated with SEDs or S/D-SEDs, and hematoxylin/eosin staining revealed microscopic epithelial layers similar to those of the untreated controls. Inflammatory markers and TUNEL studies showed that healthy epithelium had been restored in groups treated with SEDs or S/D-SEDs. In conclusion, this preclinical study supports the possibility of using S/D virally inactivated SEDs to treat DES and restore a normal epithelium.","Tseng, Ching-Li; Chen, Zhi-Yu; Renn, Ting-Yi; Hsiao, Shun-Hung; Burnouf, Thierry",PLoS One,688,1

Reliable estimates of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection are essential for understanding clinical prognosis, planning healthcare capacity, and epidemic forecasting. The case–fatality ratio (CFR), calculated from total numbers of reported cases and reported deaths, is the most commonly reported metric, but it can be a misleading measure of overall mortality. The objectives of this study were to (1) simulate the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 using publicly available surveillance data and (2) infer estimates of SARS-CoV-2 mortality adjusted for biases and examine the CFR, the symptomatic case–fatality ratio (sCFR), and the infection–fatality ratio (IFR) in different geographic locations. METHOD AND FINDINGS: We developed an age-stratified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model describing the dynamics of transmission and mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Our model accounts for two biases: preferential ascertainment of severe cases and right-censoring of mortality. We fitted the transmission model to surveillance data from Hubei Province, China, and applied the same model to six regions in Europe: Austria, Bavaria (Germany), Baden-Württemberg (Germany), Lombardy (Italy), Spain, and Switzerland. In Hubei, the baseline estimates were as follows: CFR 2.4% (95% credible interval [CrI] 2.1%–2.8%), sCFR 3.7% (3.2%–4.2%), and IFR 2.9% (2.4%–3.5%). Estimated measures of mortality changed over time. Across the six locations in Europe, estimates of CFR varied widely. Estimates of sCFR and IFR, adjusted for bias, were more similar to each other but still showed some degree of heterogeneity. Estimates of IFR ranged from 0.5% (95% CrI 0.4%–0.6%) in Switzerland to 1.4% (1.1%–1.6%) in Lombardy, Italy. In all locations, mortality increased with age. Among individuals 80 years or older, estimates of the IFR suggest that the proportion of all those infected with SARS-CoV-2 who will die ranges from 20% (95% CrI 16%–26%) in Switzerland to 34% (95% CrI 28%–40%) in Spain. A limitation of the model is that count data by date of onset are required, and these are not available in all countries. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a comprehensive solution to the estimation of SARS-Cov-2 mortality from surveillance data during outbreaks. The CFR is not a good predictor of overall mortality from SARS-CoV-2 and should not be used for evaluation of policy or comparison across settings. Geographic differences in IFR suggest that a single IFR should not be applied to all settings to estimate the total size of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in different countries. The sCFR and IFR, adjusted for right-censoring and preferential ascertainment of severe cases, are measures that can be used to improve and monitor clinical and public health strategies to reduce the deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Hauser, Anthony; Counotte, Michel J.; Margossian, Charles C.; Konstantinoudis, Garyfallos; Low, Nicola; Althaus, Christian L.; Riou, Julien",PLoS Med,688,1

The clinical symptoms of Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers are difficult to distinguish and there are currently no specific antiviral therapies against either of the viruses. Therefore, a drug that is safe and effective against both would be an enormous breakthrough. We and others have shown that the folding of the glycoproteins of many enveloped viruses, including the filoviruses, is far more dependent upon the calnexin pathway of protein folding than are most host glycoproteins. Drugs that inhibit this pathway would be expected to be selectively antiviral. Indeed, as we summarize in this review, imino sugars that are competitive inhibitors of the host endoplasmic reticular α-glucosidases I and II, which are enzymes that process N-glycan on nascent glycoproteins and thereby inhibit calnexin binding to the nascent glycoproteins, have been shown to have antiviral activity against a number of enveloped viruses including filoviruses. In this review, we describe the state of development of imino sugars for use against the filoviruses, and provide an explanation for the basis of their antiviral activity as well as limitations.","Chang, Jinhong; Guo, Ju-Tao; Du, Yanming; Block, Timothy",Emerg Microbes Infect,688,28
