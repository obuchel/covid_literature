If you did not include a short abstract for the online version when you submitted the manuscript, the first paragraph or the first 10 lines of the chapter will be displayed here. If possible, please provide us with an informative abstract. Avian infectious bronchitis virus is the prototype of the gammacoronavirus, which is responsible for highly contagious disease in chicken. It continues to be one of the most common diseases in chicken and probably endemic in all countries that raise chicken. The virus infection causes considerable economic losses in both commercial meat- and egg-type birds. The virus tropism includes respiratory tract, proventriculus, cecal tonsils, oviduct and kidney. Infections mainly cause respiratory distress in young chickens. In broiler chicken,the virus causes respiratory distress but some strains produce interstitial nephritis while others cause proventriculitis. In laying hens, the virus causes considerable decrease in egg production and quality. Antigen detection and the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are commonly used methods for rapid virus diagnosis. RT-PCR and direct gene sequence of the S1 gene or restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) are used for virus genotyping. The control strategy against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is conducted by live attenuated vaccine. To date, more than 65 genotypes and variants are characterized worldwide with poor cross protection. In addition, recombination could increase the variety of strains since live attenuated IBV vaccine viruses may recombine with virulent wild-type strains, and the resultant viruses have caused outbreaks of respiratory disease and production problems in chicken flocks.","Abdel-Moneim, Ahmed S.",Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases of Livestock,723,1

Most natural deaths are unlikely to come to the attention of the forensic pathologist, particularly in cases where death occurs in hospital. During the neonatal period (up to 28 days of age), deaths most commonly occur as a result of prematurity and related conditions, chromosomal abnormalities, or congenital malformations. Beyond the neonatal period, trauma-related deaths and sudden infant death syndrome are more common. In terms of natural acquired diseases of childhood, certain conditions are prevalent based on age and may be encountered at autopsy. Common acquired diseases that cause death in infants and children up to 5 years of age include pneumonia and other respiratory diseases, other infectious diseases, and malignancies. In older children, mortality due to natural disease declines substantially with trauma being the major cause of death, and malignancies the major cause of acquired disease. Sudden and/or unexpected deaths in which a natural disease state was previously unknown are most likely to come under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner or coroner and may be related to an underlying natural disease. Depending on the underlying disease process, the approach can differ, and therefore familiarity with common causes of death during childhood is important in order to focus the autopsy so that special techniques can be used along with obtaining proper ancillary testing to arrive at an accurate diagnosis and cause of death.","Burton, Elizabeth C.; Singer, Nicole A.",Forensic Pathology of Infancy and Childhood,723,1

Many existing embedding-based KGC models solve the Out-of-knowledge-graph (OOKG) entity problem (also known as zero-shot entity problem) by utilizing textual information resources such as descriptions and types. However, few works utilize the extra structural information to generate embeddings. In this paper, we propose a new zero-shot scenario: how to acquire the embedding vector of a relation that is not observed at training time. Our work uses a convolutional transition and attention-based aggregation graph neural network to solve both the OOKG entity problem and the new OOKG relation problem without retraining, regarding the structural neighbors as the auxiliary information. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed models in solving the OOKG relation problem.

As aspect mining can be formulated as the sequence labeling problem, supervised deep sequence learning models have recently achieved the best performance. However, these supervised models require a large amount of labeled data which are usually very costly or unavailable. To this end, we propose a semi-supervised End-to-end MOVing-window Attentive framework (called EMOVA) that has three key features for aspect mining. (1) Two neural layers with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) are employed to learn representations of reviews. (2) Cross-View Training (CVT) is used to improve the representation learning over a small set of labeled reviews and a large set of unlabeled reviews from the same domain in a unified end-to-end architecture. (3) Since past nearby information in a text provides important semantic contexts for a prediction task in aspect mining, a moving-window attention component is proposed in EMOVA to enhance prediction accuracy. Experimental results over four review datasets from the SemEval workshops show that EMOVA outperforms the state-of-the-art models for aspect mining.","Li, Ning; Chow, Chi-Yin; Zhang, Jia-Dong",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,723,1

To ensure the quality of patient care (QPC) appropriate implementation of the patient care technology management system (PCTMS) is necessary. Unfortunately, it is found to be absent in the healthcare delivery system in most of the countries in the world. The situation is very much severe, particularly, in medium- and low-income countries like Malaysia, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, etc. The opposite scenario is found in high-income countries, specifically, in Japan where QPC has been improved significantly by adopting the clinical engineering approach (CEA) in their PCDS. Up to now, QPC is determined based on prediction as there are no mathematical ways to evaluate it properly. In this study, we for the first time, propose a mathematical model to evaluate the QPC quantitatively based on feedback control analogy taking into account of CEA in PCTMS, particularly, for clinical and surgical equipment. The model consists of three subsections: the clinical engineering department (CED), PCTMS, and health care engineering directorate (HCED). The correlation among the subsections and their performance parameters are defined and standardized. Multiple linear regression method is applied to derive the least square normal equations for each of the subsections and then the regression coefficients are solved by the standard data taken from 1000 beds hospitals of different countries. The model is applied to reveal the present status of QPC for 18 different countries including high-, middle-, and low-income countries of the world. The results obtained from the model demonstrate that the present status of QPC in Japan is 84.69% and in Pakistan, it is only 0.20%. This huge discrepancy is identified to be caused by the inclusion of CEA in PCDS of Japan. The proposed model can be applied to evaluate the QPC of a hospital/in a country and hence to take necessary steps accordingly for establishing the proposed research methodology. It is to be mentioned here that the proposed model cannot be applied to evaluate the QPC in some countries like Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, etc. due to the unavailability of data related to the model parameters.","Hossain, Md.

The multifactorial processes and novel mechanisms have been identified in S. sonnei, that are collectively playing apart a substantial role in increasing its prevalence, while replacing the S. flexneri and other Gram-negative gut pathogens niche occupancy. Recently, studies suggest that due to improvement in sanitation S. sonnei has reduced cross-immunization from Plesiomonas shigelliodes (having same O-antigen as S. sonnei) and also found to outcompete the two major species of Enterobacteriaceae family (Shigella flexneri and Escherichia coli), due to encoding of type VI secretion system (T6SS). This review aimed to highlight S. sonnei as an emerging pathogen in the light of recent research with pondering aspects on its epidemiology, transmission, and pathogenic mechanisms. Additionally, this paper aimed to review S. sonnei disease pattern and related complications, symptoms, and laboratory diagnostic techniques. Furthermore, the available treatment reigns and antibiotic-resistance patterns of S. sonnei are also discussed, as the ciprofloxacin and fluoroquinolone-resistant S. sonnei has already intensified the global spread and burden of antimicrobial resistance.

How should they communicate effectively and manage disinformation? How should they slow spread of the disease without triggering xenophobia? How should they manage pressures on health care facilities? How should they manage the consequences of social distancing for society as a whole? This panel addresses the fast-moving events surrounding the virus from the perspective of public health policies and politics. Its goal is to identify and explain the different responses of European countries and the European Union- in other words, why do public health systems act as they do in response to a novel threat? It will contribute to our understanding of how the politics and governance of public health in different countries produce different outcomes, with lessons for the overall organization of European public health and also for immediate responses in what is likely to be an ongoing challenge associated with COVID-19. Each panellist will discuss a country that had a distinctive experience of the virus and response. The countries were selected for the diversity of their situations as well as the significant differences in the organization of public health and health care systems as well broader political differences. Yves Charpak will discuss France, Michelle Falkenbach will discuss Italy; Thomas Czyprionka will discuss the German speaking countries, Anniek de Ruijter will discuss the European Union's collective responses and coordination, and Elizabeth King will discuss Russia.

Emerging evidence demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with central nervous system (CNS) disease. In this series, we describe CNS manifestations in critical COVID-19 patients at our tertiary academic center. METHODS: A single center retrospective cross-sectional analysis of all patients admitted to our tertiary care academic center in New Orleans, Louisiana on April 22, 2020, who were in critical condition due to COVID-19 and developed new onset of neurological disease. Patients were grouped into one of three categories according to imaging and clinical features: encephalopathy, acute necrotizing encephalopathy, and vasculopathy. RESULTS: A total of 27 of 76 (35.5%) critical COVID-19 patients met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 59.8 years (range 35–91 years) and most had an underlying medical condition, including hypertension (63%), diabetes mellitus type 2 (52%), obesity (26%), and/or chronic kidney disease (22%). Sixty three percent had evidence of neurological injury on CT, 30% on MRI, 15% on non-invasive vascular imaging, and 44% on EEG. CT findings most often included subacute ischemic strokes, diffuse hypoattenuation, subcortical parenchymal hemorrhages, and focal hypodensities within deep structures. MRI findings included diffuse involvement of deep white matter, the corpus callosum, and the basal ganglia. For patients with acute ischemic stroke, vascular findings consisted of irregular proximal focal stenosis of the supraclinoid internal carotid artery. Twenty patients (74%) were designated with COVID-19 associated encephalopathy, two (7%) with COVID-19 associated acute necrotizing encephalopathy, and five (19%) with COVID-19 associated vasculopathy. CONCLUSION: A one-day snapshot of COVID-19 admissions at a tertiary academic center in New Orleans, LA revealed a high percentage of patients with new neurological disease. Although clinical presentations varied, they were broadly categorized. A better understanding of the neurological sequalae and radiographic findings will help clinicians mitigate the impact of this disease.","Scullen, Tyler; Keen, Joseph R; Mathkour, Mansour H; Kahn, Lora W",Neurosurgery,723,33

The solution has been adopted in European cities such as Antwerp, Florence, Lonato del Garda, Pisa, Santiago, etc., and it is capable of covering extended geographical areas around the cities themselves: Belgium, Finland, Tuscany, Sardinia, etc. In this paper, a major use case is analyzed describing the workflow followed, the methodologies adopted and the SCCR as the starting point to reproduce the same results in other smart cities, industries, research centers, etc. A Living Lab working modality is promoted and organized to enhance the collaboration among municipalities and public administration, stakeholders, research centers and the citizens themselves. The Snap4City platform has been realized respecting the European Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and it is capable of processing every day a multitude of periodic and real-time data coming from different providers and data sources. It is therefore able to semantically aggregate the data, in compliance with the Km4City multi-ontology and manage data: (i) having different access policies; and (ii) coming from traditional sources such as Open Data Portals, Web services, APIs and IoT/IoE networks. The aggregated data are the starting point for the services offered not only to the citizens but also to the public administrations and public-security service managers, enabling them to view a set of city dashboards ad hoc composed on their needs, for example, enabling them to modify and monitor public transportation strategies, offering the public services actually needed by citizens and tourists, monitor the air quality and traffic status to establish, if impose or not, traffic restrictions, etc. All the data and the new knowledge produced by the data analytics of the Snap4City platform can also be accessed, observing the permissions on each kind of data, thanks to the presence of an APIs complex system.","Mitolo, Nicola; Nesi, Paolo; Pantaleo, Gianni; Paolucci, Michela",Smart and Sustainable Planning for Cities and Regions,723,1

A multi-channel input matrix was constructed for the CNN backbone to extract deep features from different sensor signals. An SVM classifier was employed to improve the classification performance due to its high discrimination ability for small sample sizes. The effectiveness of this framework was verified by comparing it with four other machine learning models (SVM, CNN-Shi, CNN-SVM-Shi, and CNN). The proposed framework had the best performance for classifying the GTSGI and identifying the FGTSGI.

DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Medline, CINAHL, Embase and Cochrane database of systematic reviews from 1997 to 2019. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Randomised trials and observational studies of internal or external validation of EWS to predict deterioration (mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) transfer and cardiac arrest) in disease subgroups or clinical settings. RESULTS: We identified 770 studies, of which 103 were included. Study designs and methods were inconsistent, with significant risk of bias (high: n=16 and unclear: n=64 and low risk: n=28). There were only two randomised trials. There was a high degree of heterogeneity in all subgroups and in national early warning score (I(2)=72%–99%). Predictive accuracy (mean area under the curve; 95% CI) was highest in medical (0.74; 0.74 to 0.75) and surgical (0.77; 0.75 to 0.80) settings and respiratory diseases (0.77; 0.75 to 0.80). Few studies evaluated EWS in specific diseases, for example, cardiology (n=1) and respiratory (n=7). Mortality and ICU transfer were most frequently studied outcomes, and cardiac arrest was least examined (n=8). Integration with electronic health records was uncommon (n=9). CONCLUSION: Methodology and quality of validation studies of EWS are insufficient to recommend their use in all diseases and all clinical settings despite good performance of EWS in some subgroups. There is urgent need for consistency in methods and study design, following consensus guidelines for predictive risk scores. Further research should consider specific diseases and settings, using electronic health record data, prior to large-scale implementation.

Located within the city limits at a depth of 10 km, the earthquake generated a peak ground acceleration of more than 0.2 g and a maximum spectral acceleration of about 0.6 g at 0.1 s in the historic downtown area. The situation was particularly challenging since the event occurred amid a partial Covid-19 lockdown at temperatures close to 0 °C, emphasizing the extensive and complex vulnerability of the local communities and individuals. 27 people were reported severely injured, one of which later died. The surprisingly high economic costs, needed to achieve a full reconstruction of damaged buildings and infrastructure in the affected area, are currently evaluated at more than 10B euros. Description of the organization of the emergency response in the first days and the observed damage to buildings is given with typical examples. The focus is on the performance of older masonry residential and cultural heritage buildings in the historic downtown, their inspection and evaluation of damage to structural and non-structural components. This information provides the basis for understanding of the negative impacts and clarifies the overall context identifying the enablers and barriers to the still ongoing recovery process.

Lockdowns like this have had severe economic and social repercussions that are not experienced uniformly. This study evaluates whether households reporting to be severely impacted differ from those reporting to be less affected in terms of household food availability, affordability, and market access. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected as part of a World Vision Rapid Response Assessment in Vietnam (n = 3431) in May 2020. Data on household demographics, employment, food availability, affordability, and market access were collected. Households reporting a perceived severe (full or severe) impact of the COVID-19 pandemic were compared to those reporting less (moderate, slight, or no) impact using multivariable logistic regressions. RESULTS: 19.2% of respondents indicated that the pandemic had severely impacted their livelihood. There was a higher percentage of females (56.4% vs. 45.6%; P < 0.001) and urban residents (25.3% vs. 8.6%; P < 0.001) in the severely impacted group. The groups differed significantly by type of employment prior to the pandemic, and a greater proportion of those who were severely impacted reported decreased income (85.4% vs. 39.9%). Both groups reported similar availabilities of staple food groups at the household-level, but the availability of green vegetables was lower in the severely affected group (OR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.38, 1.00) than in the less affected group. However, the adjusted odds ratios for local market access to hygiene items (OR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.13, 2.39) and essential medicines (OR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.29, 2.50) indicate higher odds of accessibility for those more impacted relative to the less impacted group. CONCLUSIONS: There were relatively few differences identified between the groups. While the self-reported livelihood impact status generally aligned with a loss of income, the connection between this designation and the indicators of household food availability, affordability, and market access were not as strong. The self-determination of a severe economic impact may represent a relative change in the household's socioeconomic status from before the pandemic that is not indicative of current vulnerability.

The majority of people with TMD are women between the age of 20 and 40 years. The purpose of this study was to assess the types and prevalence of temporomandibular disorders in female patients of reproductive age with menstrual disorders. Materials and methods: The study involved 65 females of reproductive age (18–40 years, an average of 28.00 ± 6.27 years). The women who qualified for the study were patients of the University Center for Maternal and Newborn’s Health hospitalized because of infertility or menstrual cycle disorders. Women with confirmed estrogen metabolism disorders participated in a clinical study with the use of Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD). Results: In the studied female patients with menstrual disorders, temporomandibular disorders (92.3%) were frequent occurrences. The most common type was intra-articular joint disorders (68%). Other reported complaints included masticatory muscle pain (44.62%), and degenerative joint diseases (12.3%). Conclusions: 1. In women with menstrual disorders, TMD may exist. 2. In women with TMD symptoms, their medical history should be extended to include the diagnosis of female hormone disorders.","Jedynak, Bożena; Jaworska-Zaremba, Marta; Grzechocińska, Barbara; Chmurska, Magdalena; Janicka, Justyna; Kostrzewa-Janicka, Jolanta",Int J Environ Res Public Health,723,1

Because RSV-induced pulmonary disease is associated with immunopathology, we evaluated the role of IL-10 in modulating the RSV-specific immune response. We found that IL-10 protein levels in the lung were increased following acute RSV infection, with maximum production corresponding to the peak of the virus-specific T cell response. The majority of IL-10-producing cells in the lung during acute RSV infection were CD4(+) T cells. The IL-10-producing CD4(+) T cells included Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells, Foxp3(-) CD4(+) T cells that coproduce IFN-γ, and Foxp3(-) CD4(+) T cells that do not coproduce IFN-γ. RSV infection of IL-10-deficient mice resulted in more severe disease, as measured by increased weight loss and airway resistance, as compared with control mice. We also observed an increase in the magnitude of the RSV-induced CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell response that correlated with increased disease severity in the absence of IL-10 or following IL-10R blockade. Interestingly, IL-10R blockade during acute RSV infection altered CD4(+) T cell subset distribution, resulting in a significant increase in IL-17A-producing CD4(+) T cells and a concomitant decrease in Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. These results demonstrate that IL-10 plays a critical role in modulating the adaptive immune response to RSV by limiting T-cell-mediated pulmonary inflammation and injury.","Weiss, Kayla A; Christiaansen, Allison F; Fulton, Ross B; Meyerholz, David K; Varga, Steven M",Journal of immunology,723,17

Moreover, ZE had anti-bacterial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, which was 30-50% lower than that of tetracycline. After feeding the fish with diets supplemented with 0 (CT, 1 (ZE1), 2 (ZE2), and 3 (ZE3) g/kg ZE for eight weeks, there were no significant differences in growth performance and feed efficiency among the treatments; however, the fish in ZE2 and ZE3 treatments showed significantly higher survival than the fish in CT treatment. Blood leukocyte counts, plasma globulin, total immunoglobulin, lysozyme and bactericidal activity against A. hydrophila in ZE2 and ZE3 groups were significantly higher than that of CT group. All the ZE-treated groups had higher plasma complement activity compared to the CT group. Mucosal lysozyme and bactericidal activities of the ZE2 fish were significantly higher than the other treatments. Expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, and lysozyme genes increased in head kidney of the fish treated with ZE; the highest increases were related to the ZE2 treatment.

With the emergence of new variants, there is a corresponding decrease in the currently available vaccine efficacy, highlighting the need for greater insights into the viral epitope profile for both vaccine design and assessment. In this study, three immunodominant linear B cell epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) were identified by immunoinformatics prediction, and confirmed by ELISA with sera from Macaca fascicularis vaccinated with a SARS-CoV-2 RBD subunit vaccine. Further immunoinformatics analyses of these three epitopes gave rise to a method of linear B cell epitope prediction and selection. B cell epitopes in the spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins were subsequently predicted and confirmed using convalescent sera from COVID-19 infected patients. Immunodominant epitopes were identified in three regions of the S2 domain, one region at the S1/S2 cleavage site and one region at the C-terminus of the M protein. Epitope mapping revealed that most of the amino acid changes found in variants of concern are located within B cell epitopes in the NTD, RBD, and S1/S2 cleavage site. This work provides insights into B cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 as well as immunoinformatics methods for B cell epitope prediction, which will improve and enhance SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development against emergent variants.","Polyiam, Kanokporn; Phoolcharoen, Waranyoo; Butkhot, Namphueng; Srisaowakarn, Chanya; Thitithanyanont, Arunee; Auewarakul, Prasert; Hoonsuwan, Tawatchai; Ruengjitchatchawalya, Marasri; Mekvichitsaeng, Phenjun; Roshorm, Yaowaluck Maprang",Scientific reports,723,1

Here, we investigated the importance of age in household transmission dynamics. Methods: We enroled 112 households (291 participants) in a case-ascertained study in Bergen, Norway from 28th February to 4th April 2020, collecting demographic and clinical data from index patients and household members. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were measured in sera collected 6-8 weeks after index patient nasopharyngeal testing to define household attack rates. Findings: The overall attack rate was 45% (95% CI 38-53) assessed by serology, and 47% when also including seronegative RT-PCR positives. Serology identified a higher number of infected household members than RT-PCR. Attack rates were equally high in children (48%) and young adults (42%). The attack rate was 16% in asymptomatic household members and 42% in RT-PCR negative contacts. Older adults had higher antibody titres than younger adults. The risk of household transmission was higher when the index patient had fever (aOR 3.31 [95% CI 1.52-7.24]; p = 0.003) or dyspnoea (aOR 2.25 [95% CI 1.80-4.62]; p = 0.027) during acute illness. Interpretation: Serological assays provide more sensitive and robust estimates of household attack rates than RT-PCR. Children are equally susceptible to infection as young adults.

The goal of the current study was to detect specific patterns of change in ED volume and severity during a pandemic which would help to arrange medical staff and utilize facilities and resources in EDs in advance in the event of a future pandemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of the patients who visited our ED between November 1, 2019 and April 30, 2020. We evaluated the change in ED patient volume and complexity of patients in our medical record system. Patient volume and severity during various periods were identified and compared with data from the past 3 years and the period that SARS occurred. RESULTS: A reduction in ED volume was evident. The reduction began during the early epidemic period and increased rapidly during the peak period of the epidemic with the reduction continuing during the late epidemic period. No significant difference existed in the percentages of triage levels 1 and 2 between the periods. The admission rate, length of stay in the ED, and average number of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest increased during the epidemic periods. CONCLUSION: A significant reduction in ED volume during the COVID-19 pandemic was noted and a predictable pattern was found. This specific change in pattern in the ED volume may be useful for performing adjustments in EDs in the future during a novel virus pandemic. The severity of patients visiting the ED during epidemic periods was inconclusive.","Lo, Hsiang-Yun; Chaou, Chung-Hsien; Chang, Yu-Che; Ng, Chip-Jin; Chen, Shou-Yen",Am. j. emerg. med,723,16

For the investigation we employed conventional and temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry in combination with high resolving power dielectric spectroscopy techniques, broadband dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (BDS) and thermally stimulated depolarization currents (TSDC). Under ambient conditions short OEGMA (475 g mol-1, â¼4 nm in length) exhibits a remarkable low glass transition temperature, Tg, of -91 °C, crystallization temperature Tc = -24 °C and a significant crystalline fraction, CF, of â¼30%. When doubling the number of monomers (OEGMA-long, 950 g mol-1, chain length â¼8 nm) the Tg increases by about 20 K and CF increases to â¼53%, whereas, the Tc migrates to a room-like temperature of 19 °C. Upon formation of comb-like POEGMA structures the grafted OEGMA short chains, strikingly, are not able to crystallize, while in POEGMA-long the crystallization behaviour changes significantly as compared to OEGMA. Our results indicate that in the comb-like architecture the chain diffusion of the amorphous fractions is also strongly affected. The semicrystalline systems exhibit significant melt memory effects, this being stronger in the comb-like architecture. It is shown that these effects are related to the inter- and intra-chain interactions of the crystallizable chains. The dielectric techniques allowed the molecular dynamics mapping of these new systems from the linear oligomers to POEGMAs for the first time. BDS and TSDC detected various dynamics processes, in particular, the local polymer dynamics (Î³ process) to be sensitive to the Tg, local dynamics triggered in the hydrophilic chain segments by water traces (ß), as well as the segmental dynamics (&#945;) related to glass transition. Interestingly, both the short and long linear OEGMAs exhibit an additional relaxation process that resembles the Normal-Mode process appearing in polyethers. In the corresponding POEGMAs this process could not be resolved, this being an effect of the one-side grafted chain on the comb backbone. The revealed variations in molecular mobility and crystallization behavior suggest the potentially manipulable diffusion of small molecules throughout the polymer volume, via both the molecular architecture as well as the thermal treatment. This ability is extremely useful for these novel materials, envisaging their future applications in biomedicine (drug encapsulation).","Vassiliadou, Olga; Chrysostomou, Varvara; Pispas, Stergios; Klonos, Panagiotis A; Kyritsis, Apostolos",Soft matter (Online),723,6

Second, we propose a practical concept of hierarchical topic model tuning tested on datasets with human mark-up. In the numerical experiments, we consider three different hierarchical models, namely, hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation (hLDA) model, hierarchical Pachinko allocation model (hPAM), and hierarchical additive regularization of topic models (hARTM). We demonstrate that hLDA model possesses a significant level of instability and, moreover, the derived numbers of topics are far away from the true numbers for labeled datasets. For hPAM model, the Renyi entropy approach allows us to determine only one level of the data structure. For hARTM model, the proposed approach allows us to estimate the number of topics for two hierarchical levels.","Koltcov, Sergei; Ignatenko, Vera; Terpilovskii, Maxim; Rosso, Paolo",,723,16

PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar databases were systematically searched using appropriate keywords till 14 May 2021, to identify case reports/case series pertaining to mucormycosis in patients with COVID-19. Relevant data extracted included demographic characteristics, comorbidity profile, clinical category of mucormycosis, glucocorticoid use, treatment offered and patient outcome. We identified 30 case reports/case series, pooling data retrieved from 99 patients with CAM. Most cases were reported from India (72%). The majority of the patients was male (78%) and had diabetes mellitus (85%). A prior history of COVID-19 was present in 37% patients with mucormycosis developing after an initial recovery. The median time interval between COVID-19 diagnosis and the first evidence of mucormycosis infection or CAM diagnosis was 15 days. Glucocorticoid use was reported in 85% of cases. Rhino-orbital mucormycosis was most common (42%), followed by rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis (24%). Pulmonary mucormycosis was observed in 10 patients (10%). The mortality rate was 34%; the use of adjunct surgery, which was undertaken in 81% of patients, was associated with better clinical outcomes (p < .001). In conclusion, CAM is an emerging problem necessitating increased vigilance in COVID-19 patients, even those who have recovered.

The objective of this overview of systematic reviews is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the current evidence on prognosis of COVID-19 in pregnant women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used the Living OVerview of Evidence (L·OVE) platform for COVID-19, which continually retrieves studies from 46 data sources (including PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, other electronic databases, clinical trials registries, and preprint repositories, among other sources relevant to COVID-19), mapping them into PICO (population, intervention, control, and outcomes) questions. The search covered the period from the inception date of each database to 13 September 2020. We included systematic reviews assessing outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 and/or their newborns. Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts, assessed full texts to select the studies that met the inclusion criteria, extracted data, and appraised the risk of bias of each included systematic review. We measured the overlap of primary studies included among the selected systematic reviews by building a matrix of evidence, calculating the corrected covered area, and assessing the level of overlap for every pair of systematic reviews. RESULTS: Our search yielded 1132 references. 52 systematic reviews met inclusion criteria and were included in this overview. Only one review had a low risk of bias, three had an unclear risk of bias, and 48 had a high risk of bias. Most of the included reviews were highly overlapped among each other. In the included reviews, rates of maternal death varied from 0% to 11.1%, admission to intensive care from 2.1% to 28.5%, preterm deliveries before 37 weeks from 14.3% to 61.2%, and cesarean delivery from 48.3% to 100%. Regarding neonatal outcomes, neonatal death varied from 0% to 11.7% and the estimated infection status of the newborn varied between 0% and 11.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Only one of 52 systematic reviews had a low risk of bias. Results were heterogeneous and the overlap of primary studies was frequently very high between pairs of systematic reviews. High-quality evidence syntheses of comparative studies are needed to guide future clinical decisions.","Vergara-Merino, Laura; Meza, Nicolás; Couve-Pérez, Constanza; Carrasco, Cynthia; Ortiz-Muñoz, Luis; Madrid, Eva; Bohorquez-Blanco, Sandra; Pérez-Bracchiglione, Javier",Acta obstet. gynecol. scand,723,2

The post-COVID syndrome, which undoubtedly exists, is at first sight not clearly distinguishable from clinical manifestations that which occur after other acute viral diseases and after prolonged stays in ICUs due to other diseases. Therefore, it offers excellent research opportunities to clarify its pathogenesis and possibly that of other related entities. It is possible that progressively there will be an increased demand for care among the millions of people who have suffered and overcome acute COVID for which the health authorities should design mechanisms for the agile management of care that will possibly require well-coordinated multidisciplinary groups. This paper, structured in questions on different aspects of the post-COVID syndrome, attempts to stage the current state of this problem.","Bouza, E; Cantón Moreno, R; De Lucas Ramos, P; García-Botella, A; García-Lledó, A; Gómez-Pavón, J; González Del Castillo, J; Hernández-Sampelayo, T; Martín-Delgado, M C; Martín Sánchez, F J; Martínez-Sellés, M; Molero García, J M; Moreno Guillén, S; Rodríguez-Artalejo, F J; Ruiz-Galiana, J; De Pablo Brühlmann, S; Porta Etessam, J; Santos Sebastián, M",Rev. esp. quimioter,723,5

These technologies were critical to their success",9.989862,2.6531215,2021,"A poor socioeconomic environment and social adversity are fundamental determinants of human life span, well-being and health. Previous influenza pandemics showed that socioeconomic factors may determine both disease detection rates and overall outcomes, and preliminary data from the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic suggests that this is still true. Over the past years it has become clear that early-life adversity (ELA) plays a critical role biasing the immune system towards a pro-inflammatory and senescent phenotype many years later. Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) appear to be particularly sensitive to the early life social environment. As we understand more about the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 it appears that a functional CTL (CD8+) response is required to clear the infection and COVID-19 severity is increased as the CD8+ response becomes somehow diminished or exhausted. This raises the hypothesis that the ELA-induced pro-inflammatory and senescent phenotype may play a role in determining the clinical course of COVID-19, and the convergence of ELA-induced senescence and COVID-19 induced exhaustion represents the worst-case scenario with the least effective T-cell response. If the correct data is collected, it may be possible to separate the early life elements that have made people particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 many years later. This will, naturally, then help us identify those that are most at risk from developing the severest forms of COVID-19. In order to do this, we need to recognize socioeconomic and early-life factors as genuine medically and clinically relevant data that urgently need to be collected. Finally, many biological samples have been collected in the ongoing studies. The mechanisms linking the early life environment with a defined later-life phenotype are starting to be elucidated, and perhaps hold the key to understanding inequalities and differences in the severity of COVID-19.","Holuka, Cyrielle; Merz, Myriam P; Fernandes, Sara B; Charalambous, Eleftheria G; Seal, Snehaa V; Grova, Nathalie; Turner, Jonathan D",Int. j. mol. sci.

Children and adolescents seem to be particularly at risk of developing psychiatric disorders during and after the stay-at-home but evidences are lacking. The main objective of this article is to present the methodology of Coronavirus Confinement 2020 (CoCo20) Study, which aims to assess the impact of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) and stay-at-home on the development of psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in children and adolescents. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We describe a longitudinal and multicentre study in the paediatric population during and after stay-at-home related to COVID-19 pandemic. Inclusions started on 30 March 2020 for 6 months. This study is proposed to all consecutive paediatric outpatients consulting during and after stay-at-home related to COVID-19 pandemic in medical-psychological centres and in a paediatric psychotrauma centre and/or calling the emergency COVID-19 hotline. We perform standardised and internationally validated psychiatric assessments (Diagnosis Infant and Preschool Assessment, Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime Version) together with anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, PTSD, parenting stress and somatic symptoms scales during five visits (baseline, 1 week after baseline, 1 month after baseline, 1 week after the end of the containment and 1 month after the end of the containment) in patients and their families enrolled during the containment and during three visits in case of enrolment after the containment. The inclusion period will end in 30 November 2020. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Cote d'Azur University « CERNI ¼ (number 2020-59). All patients and their legal caregivers provide a written informed consent on enrolment in the study. We will submit the results of the study to relevant journals and offer national and international presentations. This study will enable better characterisation of the impact of the stay-at-home (related to COVID-19 pandemic) on the mental health of children and adolescents.

Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 still continues to evolve, and specifically the E484K, N501Y, and South Africa triple (K417N + E484K + N501Y) spike protein mutants remain as the ‘escape’ phenotypes. The aim of this study was to compare the interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the E484K, N501Y and South Africa triple spike variants and ACE2 with the interaction between wild-type spike RBD-ACE2 and to show whether the obtained binding affinities and conformations corraborate clinical findings. The structures of the RBDs of the E484K, N501Y and South Africa triple variants were generated with DS Studio v16 and energetically minimized using the CHARMM22 force field. Protein-protein dockings were performed in the HADDOCK server and the obtained wild-type and mutant spike-ACE2 complexes were submitted to 200-ns molecular dynamics simulations with subsequent free energy calculations using GROMACS. Based on docking binding affinities and free energy calculations the E484K, N501Y and triple mutant variants were found to interact stronger with the ACE2 than the wild-type spike. Interestingly, molecular dynamics and MM-PBSA results showed that E484K and spike triple mutant complexes were more stable than the N501Y one. Moreover, the E484K and South Africa triple mutants triggered greater conformational changes in the spike glycoprotein than N501Y. The E484K variant alone, or the combination of K417N + E484K + N501Y mutations induce significant conformational transitions in the spike glycoprotein, while increasing the spike-ACE2 binding affinity.

We describe the frequency, types, and duration of post-discharge symptoms suggestive of PCS among previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients in a treatment center in Nigeria. We conducted a retrospective review of admission and post-discharge follow-up medical records of COVID-19 survivors admitted between April and December 2020. A standardized checklist was used to document post-discharge symptoms. PCS was defined as persisting or new post-discharge symptoms lasting at least 3 weeks after initial COVID-19 symptoms. The relationship between study variables and development of PCS was ascertained by univariate analysis. Thirty of 51 previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients (median age, 46 years; male, 66.7%) were studied. Seventeen (56.7%) of the 30 patients developed features suggestive of PCS. Approximately three post-discharge symptoms were reported per patient over a follow-up period of ranging from 3 weeks to 9 months after initial COVID-19 symptoms. Cough, fatigue, and dyspnea were the most common post-discharge symptoms reported. A few patients had symptoms suggestive of thrombosis and COVID-19 reinfection. Among all study variables, baseline COVID-19 severity was the only significant variable associated with the development of PCS. PCS is common in our setting and is characterized by multisystemic signs and symptoms that require vigilance by clinicians for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Long-term multicenter prospective studies are needed to characterize fully the burden of PCS among COVID-19 survivors in Nigeria.","Ogoina, Dimie; James, Hendris Izibewule; Ogoinja, Stanley Zikeyi",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,723,16

METHODS: The characteristics of HUCMSCs derived from multiple donors were comprehensively analyzed including expressions of surface markers, viability, growth curve, karyotype analysis, tumorigenicity, differentiation potentials, and immune regulation capability. Then, the HUCMSCs with distinct immunomodulatory effects were applied to treat mouse liver fibrosis and their therapeutic effects were observed. RESULTS: The HUCMSCs derived from multiple donors kept a high consistency in surface marker expressions, viability, growth curve, and tumorigenicity in nude mice but had robust heterogeneities in differentiation potentials and immune regulations. In addition, three HUCMSC lines applied to mice liver fibrosis model had different therapeutic outcomes, in line with individual immune regulation capability. CONCLUSION: The HUCMSCs derived from different donors have individual heterogeneity, which potentially lead to distinct therapeutic outcomes in mouse liver fibrosis, indicating we could make use of the donor-variation of MSCs to screen out guaranteed general indicators of MSCs for specific diseases in further stromal cell therapy.

Point-of-care (POC) diagnostics offers the tantalizing possibility of providing rapid diagnostic results in non-laboratory settings. Successful diagnostic testing using body fluids has been reported on in the literature; however, small-volume detection devices, which offer remarkable advantages such as portability, inexpensiveness, capacity for mass production, and tiny sample volume requirements have not been thoroughly discussed. Here, we review progress in this research field, with a focus on developments since 2015. In this review article, we provide a summary of articles that have detailed the development of small-volume detection strategies using clinical samples over the course of the last 5 years. Topics covered include small-volume detection strategies in ophthalmology, dermatology or plastic surgery, otolaryngology, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. In ophthalmology, advances in technology could be applied to examine tear or anterior chamber (AC) fluid for glucose, lactoferrin, interferon, or VEGF. These approaches could impact detection and care for diseases including diabetic mellitus, dry-eye disease, and age-related maculopathy. Early detection and easy monitoring are critical approaches for improving overall care and outcome. In dermatology or plastic surgery, small-volume detection strategies have been applied for passive or interactive wound dressing, wound healing monitoring, and blister fluid analysis for autoimmune disease diagnosis. In otolaryngology, the analysis of nasal secretions and mucosa could be used to differentiate between allergic responses and infectious diseases. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis could be applied in neurodegenerative diseases, central neural system infection and tumor diagnosis. Other small-volume fluids that have been analyzed for diagnostic and monitoring purposes include semen and cervico-vaginal fluids. We include more details regarding each of these fluids, associated collection and detection devices, and approaches in our review.
