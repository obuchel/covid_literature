METHODS A total of 100 patients and their partners or carers were invited to complete questionnaires regarding the impact of SSc on quality of life and psychological wellbeing using valid and reliable patient-reported outcome measures (OHIP-14, MHISS, OIDP, MDAS and HADS. A total of 50 patients with SSc and 18 partners or carers who acted as controls returned the completed questionnaires. Statistical analyses were performed for comparisons of different variables. RESULTS All the mean scores of OHIP-14 [SSc (16.5±12.4) Vs controls (6.06±7.6, P .001)], MHISS components were significantly higher in patients than those of control group [SSc (21.26±12) Vs controls (4.8±7.3, P<.0001)]. Majority of OIDP mean scores were significantly worse in patients compared with controls [SSc (10±8.7) Vs controls (1.72±3.4, P<.0001)]. The mean of total MDAS [SSc (11.7±5.3) Vs controls (9.5±4.4)] and HADS scores were higher in patients compared to controls [SSc depression (4.8±3.3) and anxiety (6±4.6) Vs controls (3.7±3.1) (4.7±3.9)]. CONCLUSIONS Although the present study are limited by the low response rate and its cross-sectional design, present results highlighted that systemic sclerosis has a negative impact on OHRQoL of the affected individuals hence the evaluation of associated psychological impact including anxiety and depression symptoms is needed to better understand, monitor and evaluate the disease comorbidity in patients with SSc.","Abdouh, Ismail; Porter, Stephen; Fedele, Stefano; Elgendy, Nadia; Aboalshamat, Khalid; Ali Babkair, Hamzah; Ni Riordain, Richeal",Journal of oral pathology & medicine : official publication of the International Association of Oral Pathologists and the American Academy of Oral Pathology,827,28

The objective of this rapid review is to understand what we can learn from previous crises or disasters worldwide to optimize the care for older adults in long term care facilities during the outbreak of COVID-19. We searched five electronic databases to identify potentially relevant articles. In total, 23 articles were included in this study.Based on the articles, it appeared that nursing homes benefit from preparing for the situation as best as they can. For instance, by having proper protocols and clear division of tasks and collaboration within the organization. In addition, it is helpful for nursing homes to collaborate closely with other healthcare organizations, general practitioners, informal caregivers and local authorities. It is recommended that nursing homes pay attention to capacity and employability of staff and that they support or relieve staff where possible. With regard to care for the older adults, it is important that staff tries to find a new daily routine in the care for residents as soon as possible. Some practical tips were found on how to communicate with people who have dementia. Furthermore, behavior of people with dementia may change during a crisis. We found tips for staff how to respond and act upon behavior change. After the COVID-19 outbreak, aftercare for staff, residents, and informal caregivers is essential to timely detect psychosocial problems.The consideration between, on the one hand, acute safety and risk reduction (e.g. by closing residential care facilities and isolating residents), and on the other hand, the psychosocial consequences for residents and staff, were discussed in case of other disasters. Furthermore, the search of how to provide good (palliative) care and to maintain quality of life for older adults who suffer from COVID-19 is also of concern to nursing home organizations. In the included articles, the perspective of older adults, informal caregivers and staff is often lacking. Especially the experiences of older adults, informal caregivers, and nursing home staff with the care for older adults in the current situation, are important in formulating lessons about how to act before, during and after the coronacrisis. This may further enhance person-centered care, even in times of crisis. Therefore, we recommend to study these experiences in future research.","Boekel, Leonieke van; Stoop, Annerieke; Luijkx, Katrien G",Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie,827,1

Rare LEP mutations associated with congenital leptin deficiency cause severe early-onset obesity that can be mitigated by administering leptin. However, the role of genetic regulation of leptin in polygenic obesity remains poorly understood. We performed an exome-based analysis in up to 57,232 individuals of diverse ancestries to identify genetic variants that influence adiposity-adjusted leptin concentrations. We identify five novel variants, including four missense variants, in LEP, ZNF800, KLHL31, and ACTL9, and one intergenic variant near KLF 14 The missense variant Val94Met (rs17151919) in LEP was common in individuals of African ancestry only and its association with lower leptin concentrations was specific to this ancestry (P=2x10-16, n=3,901). Using in vitro analyses, we show that the Met94 allele decreases leptin secretion.

However, prevalence of infection among these groups is unknown. METHODS Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) for RT-PCR and serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed on mortuary and cemetery workers in Qatar. We gathered data on specific job duties, living conditions, contact history, and clinical course. Environmental sampling was carried out to explore any association with infection. We used logistic regression analysis to determine the factors associated with infection. RESULTS All 47 mortuary workers provided a NPS and 7(14.9%) were PCR-positive; 32 provided a blood sample and 8 (25%) were antibody positive, 6 (75%) of seropositive were also PCR-positive. Among the 81 cemetery workers, 76 provided a NPS and 5 (6.6%) were PCR-positive; 64 provided a blood sample and 22 (34.4%) were antibody positive, 3 (13.6%) of seropositive were also PCR-positive. Three (22.2 %) and 20 (83.3%) of infected mortuary and cemetery were asymptomatic. Age <30 years (OR 4.9, 95%CI 1.7-14.6), community exposure with a known case (OR 4.7, 95%CI 1.7-13.3), and presence of symptoms in the preceding 2 weeks (OR 9.0, 95%CI 1.9-42.0) were independently associated with an increased risk of infection (PCR or antibody positive). Of the 46 environmental and surface samples, all were negative or had a Ct value of >35. CONCLUSION A substantial proportion of mortuary and cemetery workers have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is incidentally detected upon serologic testing.

72646,72646,72646,In This Issue.,6.947123,6.1226525,2016,"Dengue is a global public health concern and this is aggravated by a lack of vaccines or antiviral therapies. Despite the well-known role of CD8(+) T cells in the immunopathogenesis of Dengue virus (DENV), only recent studies have highlighted the importance of this arm of the immune response in protection against the disease. Thus, the majority of DENV vaccine candidates are designed to achieve protective titers of neutralizing antibodies, with less regard for cellular responses. Here, we used a mouse model to investigate CD8(+) T cell and humoral responses to a set of potential DENV vaccines based on recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (rMVA). To enable this study, we identified two CD8(+) T cell epitopes in the DENV-3 E protein in C57BL/6 mice. Using these we found that all the rMVA vaccines elicited DENV-specific CD8(+) T cells that were cytotoxic in vivo and polyfunctional in vitro. Moreover, vaccines expressing the E protein with an intact signal peptide sequence elicited more DENV-specific CD8(+) T cells than those expressing E proteins in the cytoplasm. Significantly, it was these same ER-targeted E protein vaccines that elicited antibody responses. Our results support the further development of rMVA vaccines expressing DENV E proteins and add to the tools available for dengue vaccine development.","Quinan, Bárbara R; Flesch, Inge E A; Pinho, Tânia M G; Coelho, Fabiana M; Tscharke, David C; da Fonseca, Flávio G",Vaccine,827,7

Unexpectedly, MAPK pathway aberrations are associated with remarkably long patient survival, even among patients with TP53 mutations (median ∼14 yr). We explored underlying outcome-favoring mechanisms with omics followed by preclinical models. Strikingly, multiple hotspot and non-hotspot MAPK mutations (A/BRAF, HRAS, MAPK1, and MAP2K1/2) all abrogated ErbB3 activation, a well-established HNSCC progression signal. Inhibitor studies functionally defined ERK activity negatively regulating phospho-ErbB3 in MAPK-mutants. Furthermore, pan-pathway immunoprofiling investigations identified MAPK-mutant tumors as the only ""CD8+ T-cell-inflamed"" tumors inherently bearing high-immunoreactive, constitutive cytolytic tumor microenvironments. Immunocompetent MAPK-mutant HNSCC models displayed active cell death and massive CD8+ T-cell recruitment in situ. Consistent with CD8+ T-inflamed phenotypes, MAPK-mutant HNSCC patients, independent of tumor-mutational burden, survived 3.3-4 times longer than WT patients with anti-PD1/PD-L1 immunotherapies. Similar prognosticity was noted in pan-cancers. We uncovered clinical, signaling, and immunological uniqueness of MAPK-mutant HNSCC with potential biomarker utilities predicting favorable patient survival.","Ngan, Hoi-Lam; Liu, Yuchen; Fong, Andrew Yuon; Poon, Peony Hiu Yan; Yeung, Chun Kit; Chan, Sharon Suet Man; Lau, Alexandria; Piao, Wenying; Li, Hui; Tse, Jessie Sze Wing; Lo, Kwok-Wai; Chan, Sze Man; Su, Yu-Xiong; Chan, Jason Ying Kuen; Lau, Chin Wang; Mills, Gordon B; Grandis, Jennifer Rubin; Lui, Vivian Wai Yan",Life science alliance,827,17

However, laparoscopic hemihepatic vascular inflow occlusion is technically challenging. SUBJECTS AND METHODS From March 2013 to August 2013, 8 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic liver resection under right hemivascular inflow occlusion using the lowering of the hilar plate approach. RESULTS There were 3 women and 5 men, with a mean age of 52.6 years (range, 44-73 years). The pathologies were hepatocellular carcinoma (n=3), sarcomatoid liver carcinoma (n=1), hepatic vascular epithelial tumor (n=1), hemangioma (n=2), and colorectal liver metastases (n=1). The types of resection included right hepatectomy (n=3), right anterior sectionectomy (n=1), segments 5 and 6 resection (n=1), and segment 6 resection (n=2). All patients underwent right hemivascular inflow occlusion. The mean operation time was 186.2 minutes (range, 100-280 minutes). The mean time taken to prepare for hemivascular inflow occlusion was 17.8 minutes (range, 15-20 minutes). The mean intraoperative blood loss was 218.8 mL (range, 100-300 mL). The mean duration of vascular control was 25.6 minutes (range, 15-40 minutes). No patients developed postoperative liver failure. There was no postoperative morbidity or mortality. The mean hospital stay was 6 days (range, 5-7 days). CONCLUSIONS Hemihepatic vascular inflow occlusion using the lowering of the hilar plate approach was safe and feasible.

Nurse practitioners surveyed on readiness for practice report a lack of confidence and education preparation for performing selected advanced diagnostic and skills. As NPs gain independent, full practice scope, it is imperative advanced diagnostic and procedure skills used in practice are taught in nurse practitioner curriculum. The purpose of this review is to document a systematic review of the literature, answering the following question: Among primary care NPs, does current program curriculum align with current procedures and skills in theclinical setting? METHODS PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, CINAHL, and Embase were searched between inception and 2018 using the search terms ""advanced practice nursing, clinical competence, diagnostic techniques or procedures, and primary health care."" Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines, nine articles were included in the synthesis. CONCLUSION There is scant research regarding NP educational preparation of skills and procedures. Study findings indicate that programs are not teaching all the procedures deemed important. Education should promote improved congruence between the skills and procedures taught in program curricula and those used in clinical practice. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE It is critical to complete an education practice survey measuring skill and procedure preparation and competency at graduation. Survey results will determine whether skill and procedure guidelines are indicated for NP education. A recommendation may include minimal skills and procedure for all nurse practitioner curricula.","Schallmo, Marianne K; Godfrey, Timian M; Dunbar, Darryn; Brown, Kristen M; Coyle, Amanda; DʼAoust, Rita F",Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,827,12

METHODS Interviews with 27 key informants in 15 states with successful IPS programs in rural communities identified challenges that IPS workers faced because of rurality and the work-around methods they used to overcome these challenges. The authors conducted a thematic analysis of interviews. RESULTS Significant challenges to implementing IPS in rural areas included limited availability of public transportation, Internet connectivity, employment opportunities, and workforce. The work-around strategies used by IPS teams differed in relation to local circumstances and cultures, but effective services generally used natural supports for transportation, provided computer access for job applicants, developed relationships with local employers, and hired IPS workers with local knowledge.

DESIGN Cross-sectional survey with survey items developed through literature review and revised following piloting. SETTING The electronic survey was disseminated internationally in November 2019 via e-mail directories of pediatric intensive care societies and networks and using social media. PATIENTS Healthcare providers who self-identified as working in resource-limited settings. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Results were summarized using descriptive statistics and resource availability was compared across World Bank country income groups. We received 328 responses (238 hospitals, 60 countries), predominantly in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa (n = 161, 67.4%). Hospitals were in low-income (28, 11.7%), middle-income (166, 69.5%), and high-income (44, 18.4%) countries. Across 174 PICU and adult ICU admitting children, there were statistically significant differences in the proportion of hospitals reporting consistent resource availability (""often"" or ""always"") between country income groups (p < 0·05). Resources with limited availability in lower income countries included advanced ventilatory support, invasive and noninvasive monitoring, central venous access, renal replacement therapy, advanced imaging, microbiology, biochemistry, blood products, antibiotics, parenteral nutrition, and analgesic/sedative drugs. Seventy-seven ICUs (52.7%) were staffed 24/7 by a pediatric intensivist or anesthetist. The nurse-to-patient ratio was less than 1:2 in 71 ICUs (49.7%). CONCLUSIONS Contemporary data demonstrate significant disparity in the availability of essential and advanced human and material resources for the care of critically ill children in resource-limited settings. Minimum standards for essential pediatric emergency and critical care in resource-limited settings are needed.","Muttalib, Fiona; González-Dambrauskas, Sebastián; Lee, Jan Hau; Steere, Mardi; Agulnik, Asya; Murthy, Srinivas; Adhikari, Neill K J",Critical care medicine,827,7

Spatial overlap with domestic animals is a prominent exposure pathway. However, most studies of wildlife - domestic animal interfaces have focused on livestock and little is known about the wildlife - companion animal interface. Here, we investigated the prevalence and phylogenetic relatedness of extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistant (ESC-R) Escherichia coli from raccoons (Procyon lotor) and domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) in the metropolitan area of Chicago, USA. To assess the potential importance of spatial overlap with dogs, we explored whether raccoons sampled at public parks (i.e., parks where people and dogs could enter) differed in prevalence and phylogenetic relatedness of ESC-R E. coli to raccoons sampled at private parks (i.e., parks where people and dogs could not enter). Raccoons had a significantly higher prevalence of ESC-R E. coli (56.9%) than dogs (16.5%). However, the richness of ESC-R E. coli did not vary by host species. Further, core single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based phylogenetic analyses revealed that isolates did not cluster by host species, and in some cases displayed a high degree of similarity (i.e., differed by less than 20 core SNPs). Spatial overlap analyses revealed that ESC-R E. coli were more likely to be isolated from raccoons at public parks than raccoons at private parks, but only for parks located in suburban areas of Chicago, not urban areas. That said, ESC-R E. coli isolated from raccoons did not genetically cluster by park of origin. Our findings suggest that domestic dogs and urban/suburban raccoons can have a diverse range of ARB, some of which display a high degree of genetic relatedness (i.e., differ by less than 20 core SNPs). Given the differences in prevalence, domestic dogs are unlikely to be an important source of exposure for mesocarnivores in urbanized areas.IMPORTANCEAntimicrobial resistant bacteria (ARB) have been detected in numerous wildlife species across the globe, which may have important implications for human and animal health. Wildlife can be exposed to ARB via numerous pathways, including via spatial overlap with domestic animals. However, the interface with domestic animals has mostly been explored for livestock and little is known about the interface between wild animals and companion animals. Our work suggests that urban and suburban wildlife can have similar ARB to local domestic dogs, but local dogs are unlikely to be a direct source of exposure for urban-adapted wildlife. This finding is important because it underscores the need to incorporate wildlife into antimicrobial resistance surveillance efforts, and to investigate whether certain urban wildlife species could act as additional epidemiological pathways of exposure for companion animals, and indirectly for humans.","Worsley-Tonks, Katherine E L; Gehrt, Stanley D; Miller, Elizabeth A; Singer, Randall S; Bender, Jeff B; Forester, James D; McKenzie, Shane C; Travis, Dominic A; Johnson, Timothy J; Craft, Meggan E",Applied and environmental microbiology,827,16

Lactic acid, a byproduct of glucose metabolism, is abundantly present in inflamed tissues and has been shown to regulate functions of several immune cells. Because the endogenous ligands for MRGPRX2 (substance P and LL-37) are elevated during pathologic conditions, such as cancer and asthma, and given that lactic acid levels are also enhanced in these patients, we explored the role of lactic acid in regulating mast cells response via MRGPRX2 and MrgprB2, the mouse orthologue of the human receptor. We found that lactic acid suppressed both the early (Ca2+ mobilization and degranulation) and late (chemokine/cytokine release) phases of mast cell activation; this data was confirmed in LAD2, human skin and mouse peritoneal mast cells. In LAD2 cells, the reduction in degranulation and chemokine/cytokine production mediated by lactic acid was dependent on pH. In agreement with our in vitro studies, lactic acid also reduced passive systemic anaphylaxis to compound 48/80 (a known MRGPRX2/MrgprB2 ligand) and skin inflammation in a mouse model of rosacea that is dependent on MrgprB2 expression on skin mast cells. Our data thus suggest that lactic acid may serve to inhibit mast cell-mediated inflammation during asthma and reduce immune response during cancer by affecting mast cell activation through MRGPRX2.","Syed, Meesum; Kammala, Ananth K; Callahan, Brianna; Oskeritzian, Carole A; Subramanian, Hariharan",Cellular immunology,827,24

The leak rate after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) ranges between 1.1 and 5.3 %. The aim of the paper is to provide an overview of the current pathogenic and promoting factors of leakage after LSG on the basis of recent literature review and to report the evidence based preventive measures. METHODS Risk factors and pathogenesis of leakage after LSG were examined based on an extensive review of literature and evidence based analysis of the most recent published studies using Oxford centre for evidence-based medicine, 2011, levels of evidence. RESULTS Pathogenesis of leakage after LSG can be attributed to mechanical or ischemic causes. Many factors can predispose to leakage after LSG which are either technically related or patient related. Awareness of these predisposing factors and technical tips may decrease the incidence of leakage. CONCLUSIONS This review reports factors promoting leak and gives technical recommendations to avoid leak after LSG based on the available evidence and expert consensus which encompasses: (1) use a bougie size ≥40 Fr, EL:1, (2) begin the gastric transection 5-6 cm from the pylorus, EL:2-3, (3) use appropriate cartridge colors from antrum to fundus, EL:1, (4) reinforce the staple line with buttress material, EL:1, (5) follow a proper staple line, (6) remove the crotch staples, EL:4, (7) maintain proper traction on the stomach before firing, (8) stay away from the angle of His at least 1 cm, EL:1, (9) check the bleeding from the staple line, (10) perform an intraoperative methylene blue test, EL:4.","Iossa, Angelo; Abdelgawad, Mohamed; Watkins, Brad Michael; Silecchia, Gianfranco",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,827,1

Among 1,236 patients with COVID-19, 45 (3.6%) were evaluated with contrast-enhanced CT examination. VTE events occurred in 10 patients (22.2%), and the incidence of VTE in mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 was 0%, 11.8%, and 40.0%, respectively. COVID-19 patients with VTE showed a higher body weight (81.6 vs. 64.0 kg, P=0.005) and body mass index (26.9 vs. 23.2 kg/m2, P=0.04), and a higher proportion had a severe status for COVID-19 compared with those without. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients alive at discharge between patients with and without VTE (80.0% vs. 88.6%, P=0.48). Among 8 pulmonary embolism (PE) patients, all were low-risk PE. CONCLUSIONS Among a relatively small number of patients undergoing contrast-enhanced CT examination in Japanese real-world clinical practice, there were no VTE patients among those with mild COVID-19, but the incidence of VTE seemed to be relatively high among severe COVID-19 patients, although all PE events were low-risk without significant effect on mortality risk.","Yamashita, Yugo; Maruyama, Yuuki; Satokawa, Hirono; Nishimoto, Yuji; Tsujino, Ichizo; Sakashita, Hideki; Nakata, Hiroko; Okuno, Yoshinori; Ogihara, Yoshito; Yachi, Sen; Toya, Naoki; Shingaki, Masami; Ikeda, Satoshi; Yamamoto, Naoto; Aikawa, Shizu; Ikeda, Nobutaka; Hayashi, Hiroya; Ishiguro, Shingo; Iwata, Eriko; Umetsu, Michihisa; Kondo, Akane; Iwai, Takehisa; Kobayashi, Takao; Mo, Makoto; Yamada, Norikazu",Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,827,5

When there is overlap, the recommendations made here supersede those of previous guidelines. METHODS This focused update analyzes results from 8 randomized, clinical trials of endovascular treatment and other relevant data published since 2013. It is not intended to be a complete literature review from the date of the previous guideline publication but rather to include pivotal new evidence that justifies changes in current recommendations. Members of the writing committee were appointed by the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Stroke Council's Scientific Statement Oversight Committee and the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Manuscript Oversight Committee. Strict adherence to the American Heart Association conflict of interest policy was maintained throughout the consensus process. Recommendations follow the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association methods of classifying the level of certainty of the treatment effect and the class of evidence. Prerelease review of the draft guideline was performed by 6 expert peer reviewers and by the members of the Stroke Council Scientific Statement Oversight Committee and Stroke Council Leadership Committee.

This study aimed to evaluate the anti-bacterial effects of a previously designed peptide named PVP towards the clinical strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in vitro. Secondary structure, cytotoxicity, and membrane-permeabilizing effects of the peptide were also assessed. PVP had a tendency to adopt alpha-helical conformation based upon structural predictions and circular dichroism spectroscopy (in 50% trifluoroethanol). The peptide showed MIC values ranging from 1 to 16 µg/mL against 10 strains of MRSA. In contrast to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin, PVP at sub-lethal concentration (1 µg/mL) did not provoke the development of peptide resistance after 14 serial passages. Remarkably, 1 h of exposure to 4 × MBC of PVP (8 µg/mL) was sufficient for total bacterial clearance, whereas 4 × MBC of vancomycin (8 µg/mL) failed to totally eradicate bacterial cells, even after 8 h. PVP showed negligible cytotoxicity against human dermal fibroblasts at concentrations required to kill the MRSA strains. The results of flow cytometric analysis and fluorescence microscopy revealed that PVP caused bacterial membrane permeabilization, eventually culminating in cell death. Owing to the potent anti-bacterial activity, fast bactericidal kinetics, and negligible cytotoxicity, PVP has the potential to be used as a candidate antibiotic for the topical treatment of MRSA infections.","Memariani, Hamed; Memariani, Mojtaba; Robati, Reza Mahmoud; Nasiri, Soheila; Abdollahimajd, Fahimeh; Baseri, Zohre; Moravvej, Hamideh",World journal of microbiology & biotechnology,827,16

A predefined secondary hypothesis was that subjects with significant early ischemic change on the baseline scan would not respond to endovascular therapy. METHODS The primary outcome was 90-day modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 2. The baseline and follow-up computed tomographic (CT) scan images were reviewed centrally and blinded to any clinical information. We assessed whether the baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) predicted outcome and interacted with study treatment. We analyzed subgroups defined by time from onset to intravenous tPA initiation and baseline occlusion status at a prespecified α=0.01. RESULTS Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of 656 randomized patients were similar between subjects with a baseline ASPECTS 8 to 10 (58% of the study sample) versus 0 to 7. Subjects with ASPECTS 8 to 10 were almost twice as likely (relative risk, 1.8; 99% confidence interval, 1.4-2.4) to achieve a favorable outcome. There was insufficient evidence of a treatment-by-ASPECTS interaction. In those treated with onset to intravenous tPA <120 minutes, in CT angiography-proven internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery occlusion, and in both, results were similar. The probability of achieving recanalization (arterial occlusion lesion, 2-3) of the primary arterial occlusive lesion (relative risk, 1.3; 99% confidence interval, 1.0-1.8) or achieving thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia score 2b/3 reperfusion (relative risk 2.0; 99% confidence interval, 1.2-3.2) was higher among subjects with higher ASPECTS. CONCLUSIONS ASPECTS is a strong predictor of outcome and a predictor of reperfusion. ASPECTS did not identify a subpopulation of subjects that particularly benefitted from endovascular therapy immediately after routine intravenous tPA.

Herein, we use noninvasive isotope-edited FTIR spectroscopy to derive a structural model for the SARS coronavirus E protein transmembrane domain in lipid bilayers. Molecular-dynamics-based structural refinement, incorporating the IR-derived orientational restraints points to the formation of a helical hairpin structure. Disulfide cross-linking and X-ray reflectivity depth profiling provide independent support of the results. The unusually short helical hairpin structure of the protein might explain its ability to deform bilayers and is reminiscent of other peptides with membrane disrupting functionalities. Taken together, we show that isotope-edited FTIR is a powerful tool to analyze small membrane proteins in their native environment, enabling us to relate the unusual structure of the SARS E protein to its function.","Manor, Joshua; Arbely, Eyal; Beerlink, Andrè; Akkawi, Mutaz; Arkin, Isaiah T",The journal of physical chemistry letters,827,1

The patients in group A received brain protection based on the intraoperative monitoring of regional cerebral oxygen saturation and the patients in group B received conventional brain protection. The general clinical data, the types of corrective surgeries, the intraoperative situations, the postoperative complications, and the midterm outcomes of the patients were analyzed. RESULTS The incidence of postoperative cerebral dysfunction in the patients of group A was significantly lower than that in the patients in group B (3.2% vs 14.9%, P = .020). We found significant differences in the incubation times (30.3 ± 22.1 vs 42.3 ± 27.9 hours, P = .014), the lengths of intensive care unit stay (58.0 ± 54.3 vs 79.7 ± 55.5 hours, P = .004), and the hospital stays (19.3 ± 6.7 vs 24.9 ± 17.3 days, P = .045).

However, development of new vaccines is highly dependent on availability of analytical methods for their design and evaluation. This paper highlights the challenges presented in having to rapidly develop vaccine analytical tools during an ongoing pandemic, including the need to address progressive virus mutation and adaptation which can render initial assays unreliable or redundant. It also discusses the potential of new computational modeling techniques to model and analyze key viral proteins and their attributes to assist vaccine production and assay design. It then reviews the current range of analytical tools available for COVID-19 vaccine application, ranging from in vitro assays for immunogen characterization to assays to measure vaccine responses in vivo. Finally, it provides a future perspective for COVID-19 vaccine analytical tools and attempts to predict how the field might evolve over the next 5-10 years.","Baldwin, Jeremy; Piplani, Sakshi; Sakala, Isaac G; Honda-Okubo, Yoshikazu; Li, Lei; Petrovsky, Nikolai",Bioanalysis,827,30

Although airway epithelial cells represent an important target for infection, the respiratory epithelium is also composed of an elaborate network of dendritic cells (DCs) that are essential sentinels of the immune system, sensing pathogens and presenting foreign antigens to T lymphocytes. In this report, we show that in vitro infection by human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) induces massive cytopathic effects in DCs, including the formation of large syncytia and cell death within only few hours. In contrast, monocytes are much more resistant to infection and cytopathic effects despite similar expression levels of CD13, the membrane receptor for HCoV-229E. While the differentiation of monocytes into DCs in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4 requires 5 days, only 24 h are sufficient for these cytokines to sensitize monocytes to cell death and cytopathic effects when infected by HCoV-229E. Cell death induced by HCoV-229E is independent of TRAIL, FasL, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and caspase activity, indicating that viral replication is directly responsible for the observed cytopathic effects. The consequence of DC death at the early stage of HCoV-229E infection may have an impact on the early control of viral dissemination and on the establishment of long-lasting immune memory, since people can be reinfected multiple times by HCoV-229E.","Mesel-Lemoine, Mariana; Millet, Jean; Vidalain, Pierre-Olivier; Law, Helen; Vabret, Astrid; Lorin, Valérie; Escriou, Nicolas; Albert, Matthew L; Nal, Béatrice; Tangy, Frédéric",Journal of virology,827,6

The aim of this study was to analyze the cause of intraoperative hemorrhage and to explore therapeutic strategies. METHODS Retrospective review was performed of 53 consecutive patients with DAVF treated by Onyx embolization between February 2009 and December 2014. Tentorial DAVF with pial arterial supply was diagnosed in 6 patients (2 women and 4 men; mean age, 47.3 years ± 10.2), and transarterial Onyx embolization was performed in these patients. Fisher exact test was used to analyze differences of incidence of procedure-related complications. RESULTS Intraoperative hemorrhage occurred in 2 of 6 patients with pial arterial supply. One patient died as a result of hemorrhage, and the other patient survived after craniotomy. The incidence of complications for these 6 patients (2 of 6; 33.3%) was significantly higher (P = 0.0309) compared with patients with DAVF without pial arterial supply (1 of 47; 2.1%). CONCLUSIONS Pial arterial supply may be a risk factor for intraoperative hemorrhage during transarterial embolization of DAVF through dural feeders. Identification of pial feeders and early superselective occlusion of such feeders are important for safe management.","Wu, Qi; Zhang, Xiang-Sheng; Wang, Han-Dong; Zhang, Qing-Rong; Wen, Li-Li; Hang, Chun-Hua; Zhang, Xin",World neurosurgery,827,1

This study aims to establish the outcomes of contaminated complex AWR. METHOD Analysis was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Systematic search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Pubmed databases was performed. Studies reporting exclusively on single-staged repair of contaminated complex AWR were included. Pooled data were analysed to establish rates of complications. RESULTS Sixteen studies were included, consisting of 601 contaminated complex AWRs, of which 233 included concurrent enterocutaneous fistula repair. The average follow-up period was 26.7 months. There were 146 (24.3%) reported hernia recurrences. When stratified by repair method, suture repair alone had the lowest rate of recurrence (14.2%), followed by nonabsorbable synthetic mesh reinforcement (21.2%), biological mesh (25.8%) and absorbable synthetic mesh (53.1%). Hernia recurrence was higher when fascial closure was not achieved. Of the 233 enterocutaneous fistula repairs, fistula recurrence was seen in 24 patients (10.3%). Suture repair alone had the lowest rate of recurrence (1.6%), followed by nonbiological mesh (10.3%) and biological mesh reinforcement (12%). Forty-six per cent of patients were reported as having a wound-related complication and the mortality rate was 2.5%. CONCLUSION It is feasible to perform simultaneous enterocutaneous fistula repair and AWR as rates of recurrent fistula are comparable with series describing enterocutaneous fistula repair alone. Hernias recurred in nearly a quarter of cases. This analysis is limited by a lack of comparative data and variability of outcome reporting.","Hodgkinson, J D; Maeda, Y; Leo, C A; Warusavitarne, J; Vaizey, C J",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,827,12

Methods Between December 2014 and December 2019, 13 patients underwent the reconstruction of soft tissue defects in various sites using the lower trapezius musculocutaneous flap carrying a portion of the latissimus dorsi muscle. There were 10 males and 3 females, with an average age of 52.1 years (range, 29-83 years). Twelve wounds were resulted from resection of various malignant tumor, including 6 cases of head and neck tumors, 5 cases of shoulder and back tumors, 1 case of chest and back tumors. Among the 12 cases, 4 cases were complicated with wound infection and bone exposure, 1 case with skull defect and cerebral dura exposure, and 1 case with wound infection, skull necrosis, and cerebrospinal fluid leakage. One case was injured in a traffic accident, which resulted in infection wound in the back and shoulder and bone exposure. The sizes of the defect and musculocutaneous flap ranged from 11 cm×7 cm to 23 cm×15 cm and 25 cm×8 cm to 40 cm×14 cm, respectively. According to the spatial relationship between the donor and recipient sites, propeller flaps (8 cases) or percutaneous tunnel island flaps (5 cases) were used to transfer the myocutaneous flap to the recipient area to repair the wound. The donor site was directly closed and sutured in 9 cases, and those with excessive tension were repaired with free skin grafts in 2 cases or transferred flaps in 2 cases. Results After the operation, necrosis of the distal 4-cm of the musculocutaneous flap occurred in 2 cases. After debridement, the resultant wounds were reconstructed using a local flap and a posterior intercostal artery perforator flap, respectively. The remaining 11 myocutaneous flaps survived completely without arteries and veins crisis. The wounds in the donor and recipient areas healed by first intention. All the patients were followed up 1 to 48 months (mean, 7.4 months). The color and texture of the flap were good. During the follow-up, 1 patient underwent tumor resection again due to tumor recurrence, and 1 patient with a scalp hemangiosarcoma died due to unexplained thoracic hemorrhage. Tumor recurrence was not found in the remaining patients. The musculocutaneous flap coverage was stable and the infection was controlled. Conclusion The lower trapezius musculocutaneous flap carrying a portion of the latissimus dorsi muscle can be an alternation option to reconstruct refractory wounds with exposure of vital structures and organs and infection.","Xie, Tingjun; Liu, Yuanbo; Han, Tinglu; Zhu, Shan; Zang, Mengqing; Chen, Bo; Li, Shanshan",Zhongguo xiu fu chong jian wai ke za zhi = Zhongguo xiufu chongjian waike zazhi = Chinese journal of reparative and reconstructive surgery,827,20

DESIGN Retrospective descriptive study. SETTING Pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary pediatric hospital situated in Cape Town, South Africa. PATIENTS All children (n = 195; 20% pediatric intensive care unit admissions) with positive respiratory viral isolates between April 1 and December 31, 2009. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were recorded from medical folders. Complete data were available for 175 patients (median age [interquartile range] 4.7 months [2.3-12.9 months]; 49% male). One hundred four (59.4%) patients had comorbid conditions; 30 (17%) were HIV-infected. Rhinovirus (n = 76 [39%]), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 54 [27.7%]), adenovirus (n = 30 [15.4%]), influenza A (n = 26 [13.3%]), parainfluenza (n = 23 [11.8%]), and human metapneumovirus (n = 12 [6.2%]) were most commonly isolated. Ninety-five infections (51.4%) were isolated >48 hrs after admission. Seasonal patterns were identified for respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and influenza A, whereas others occurred throughout the year. Twenty-five patients (14.3%) had more than one viral isolate. Presumed bacterial coinfection, which occurred in 68 (39%) patients (18 [26.5%] HIV-infected), was associated with significantly longer pediatric intensive care unit and hospital stays but not with mortality. Twenty patients died (11%, standardized mortality ratio 0.64). High Pediatric Index of Mortality scores, HIV exposure and infection, nosocomial infection, and influenza A infection were associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS Viral respiratory tract infection is common in this pediatric intensive care unit associated with significant morbidity and mortality, which may relate to the high burden of comorbidity and HIV.","Ghani, Ani S Abdul; Morrow, Brenda M; Hardie, Diana R; Argent, Andrew C",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,827,2

We compared patient-reported gait and ambulation problems between SGAP flap and deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap reconstructions. METHODS Forty-three patients who underwent bilateral free flap breast reconstruction (17 SGAP, 26 DIEP) participated in the study. The Lower Extremity Functional Score (LEFS) was administered with a supplementary section evaluating gait, balance, fatigue, and pain. Patients evaluated how they felt 2 months postoperatively and at time of survey administration. Multivariate regressions were fit to assess association between type of reconstruction and self-reported lower extremity function controlling for potential confounding factors. RESULTS Although there was no significant difference in overall LEFS between the cohorts on the date of survey, the SGAP patients reported greater difficulty performing the following activities after surgery (P < 0.05): work, usual hobbies, squatting, walking a mile, walking up stairs, sitting for an hour, running, turning, and hopping. The SGAP patients also reported easier fatigue (P < 0.01) both during the early postoperative period and on the date of survey. CONCLUSIONS SGAP flap surgery causes no statistically significant differences in overall LEFS. However, SGAP patients did report donor-site morbidity with decreased ability to perform certain activities and increased fatigue and pain in the longer follow-up period. We feel that patients should be educated regarding gait issues and undergo physical therapy during the early postoperative period.","Hur, Kevin; Ohkuma, Rika; Bellamy, Justin L; Yamazaki, Michiyo; Manahan, Michele A; Rad, Ariel N; Cooney, Damon S; Rosson, Gedge D",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

We analyse the clinical characteristics and management outcomes of a small group of patients who have been treated in the early stage of the COVID-19 disease, and discuss the impact of the pandemic on the service delivered to breast cancer patients. Material Methods: We analysed a cohort of 130 breast cancer patients who underwent elective surgical procedures during the early period of COVID-19. The patients were operated on in the period from March 16th, 2020 to May 18th, 2020. Results: All the patients were female, with an age range of 33-88 years, with a median age of 57.6 years. Most of the cases were admitted as a day case surgery after passing through a preoperative screening pathway, which was developed gradually. Patients were contacted by phone after their surgery to ensure that they have had no symptoms and were reviewed in person two weeks after the procedure with histology results. Only one patient developed COVID-19 symptoms after surgery and recovered. Conclusions: Early and careful implementation of modified practice policies during emerging situation of viral pandemics will reduce the risk of perioperative complications, reduce the risk of patient to staff to patient transmission and minimize the negative impact of COVID-19 on breast cancer management.","Abdalla, Abdalla Saad; Asaad, Amira; Fisher, Rebecca; Clayton, Gill; Syed, Abdul; Barron, Marina; Idaewor, Philip; Salih, Ali; Elamass, Mohamed; Aladili, Zina; Menon, Jay; Uddin, Aaliya; Gee, Hilary; Bonner, Denise; Merron, Helen; Duncombe, Karen; Campaner, Gabriel; Alkistawi, Firas; Targett, John; Eleti, Sudhakar Reddy; Comez, Turhan; Smith, Simon; Thomas, Harun; Lovett, Broyny; Chicken, Wayne",Chirurgia,827,7

We examined early and midterm outcomes, the need for reoperation, postoperative residual AV valve regurgitation, and other risk factors after various CAVSD repairs. METHODS Between 2014 and 2018, we have performed 89 isolated CAVSD repairs. We retrospectively reviewed the patients' medical records. Patients were divided into three groups according to their repair techniques modified one patch repair (MP) (n = 16); two patch repair (TP) (n = 49); and left anterior leaflet augmentation (ALA) technique (n = 24). RESULTS Eighty patients (89.8%) survived hospital discharge. Early mortality rates were three (18.8%) in the group MP, five (10.2%) in the group TP, and one (4.2%) in the group ALA. Thirteen patients died during the follow-up period. Late mortality rates were three (18.8%) in the group MP, four (16.6%) in the group ALA, and six (12.2%) in the group TP. The mean follow-up time was 35.9 ± 22.97 months (range: 0.3-77 months). The morbidity and mortality results were similar between-group TP and ALA but worse in the MP group. Low body weight (<4 kg) and younger age at surgery (<4 months) were found to be risk factors on mortality by univariate and multivariate analysis. Surgical technic was not found to be an independent risk factor. CONCLUSION In our series, TP and ALA techniques had satisfactory results in early and midterm periods. Younger age and small bodyweight might increase early mortality and the need for reoperation.","Basgoze, Serdar; Yildiz, Okan; Ozturk, Erkut; Onan, Ismihan Selen",Journal of cardiac surgery,827,0

One of the most prominent representatives of gammacoronavirus genus is infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) which is a highly contagious viral pathogen of chickens causing considerable economic losses to the poultry industry. IBVs mostly affect the respiratory, urinary, and reproductive tracts leading to a substantial drop in production. Backyard poultry in the villages usually share their food and water with free flight birds which puts them at serious risk of disease transmission. Furthermore, the poor hygienic measurements which are often used in backyard flocks make them a potential reservoir for diseases that can be transferred to commercial poultry flocks. Live bird markets (LBMs) which receive live poultry to be resold or slaughtered and sold onsite play a significant role in spreading infectious diseases among the different bird species. In the present study, a number of 354 cloacal swab samples were collected from different bird species from LBMs of Gilan province. Subsequently, after RNA extraction, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique was carried out using specific primers of S1 gene to detect coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus. Two samples from backyard chickens were reported to be positive to coronavirus which were named Iran/Backyardchicken 96/2017 and Iran/Backyardchicken 94/2017. The results of the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that these two isolates are placed in QX and IS-1494 strains, respectively.

Air samples were collected simultaneously at both sites over 4 h time periods for 3 consecutive days during a stable high pressure system in August 2007. Higher PBDE concentrations in the city compared to the Uetliberg site indicate that Zurich is a likely source of PBDEs to the atmosphere. A multimedia mass balance model was used to (i) explain the diel cycling pattern of PBDE concentrations observed at both sites in terms of dominant processes and (ii) estimate emission rates of PBDEs from the city to the atmosphere. We estimate that Zurich emits 0.4, 6.2, 1.6, and 0.4 kg year(-1) of the PBDE congeners 28, 47, 99, and 100, respectively. On a per-capita basis, these estimates are within the range or somewhat above those obtained in other studies using approaches based on emission factors (EF) and PBDE production, usage, and disposal data, or concentration measurements. The present approach complements emission estimates based on the EF approach and can also be applied to source areas where EFs and PBDE material flows are poorly characterized or unknown, such as electronic waste processing plants.","Moeckel, Claudia; Gasic, Bojan; MacLeod, Matthew; Scheringer, Martin; Jones, Kevin C; Hungerbühler, Konrad",Environmental science & technology,827,11

A general supposition among neurointerventionalists is that embolization of cerebral AVM with silk sutures and PVA particles does not yield a durable occlusion. We performed a retrospective review of all AVM patients treated at our institution with combined SPE and SRS. After extracting the baseline, embolization and SRS data for each patient, the durability of SPE was determined by evaluating the postembolization recanalization between the last procedural angiogram and the most recent neuroimaging. Four AVM patients who underwent a total of nine SPE procedures through 21 arterial pedicles were included for the analyses. The nidus volumes were 5.8-75 cm(3) and the Spetzler-Martin grades were II and V in one patient and III in two patients. The median degree of devascularization per procedure was <25%. There were no procedural complications, with all patients maintaining functional independence after embolization (modified Rankin scale score 0-2). After a median follow-up duration of 27 months (range: 23-36), there were no patients with recanalization. SRS (marginal dose 13-18 Gy) resulted in 40 to >95% volume reduction. Following SRS, one patient remained asymptomatic, two patients improved, and one patient deteriorated due to a latency period AVM hemorrhage. In conclusion, SPE can safely provide durable AVM devascularization, therefore, appropriately selected nidi can be effectively treated with combined SPE and SRS.","Ding, Dale; Sheehan, Jason P; Starke, Robert M; Durst, Christopher R; Raper, Daniel M; Conger, Jordan R; Evans, Avery J",Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,827,1

Although the principles behind these strategies are not new, the capacity and operational requirements needed to support disease investigation during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic are unprecedented. This article analyzes the implementation of case investigation and contact tracing in controlling COVID-19 transmission during the early stages of the US pandemic response (January 20 through August 31, 2020). PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION Governmental public health agencies mobilized to expand case investigation and contact tracing programs in the early months of the pandemic. In doing so, they encountered a range of challenges that included rapidly scaling up the workforce; developing and subsequently revising guidance and protocols specific to COVID-19 as more was learned about the virus over time; defining job functions; encouraging public acceptance of and participation in case investigation and contact tracing; and assessing the utility of these activities during both the containment and mitigation phases of outbreak response. COVID-19 case investigation and contact tracing programs presented an array of opportunities for health departments to innovate, especially around technology to support public health efforts, as well as opportunities to address health equity and advance community resilience. CONCLUSION Lessons learned from disease intervention specialists, guidance and resources from federal agencies and national partners, and peer-to-peer exchange of promising practices can support jurisdictions encountering early implementation challenges. Further research is needed to assess COVID-19 case investigation and contact tracing program models and innovations, as well as strategies for implementing these activities during containment and mitigation phases.","Ruebush, Elizabeth; Fraser, Michael R; Poulin, Amelia; Allen, Meredith; Lane, J T; Blumenstock, James S",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,827,1

The current study aimed to explore care toward PwD and detect if any aspects of care are omitted. An observation study was conducted in three medical-surgical adult wards of an acute general hospital. Data were collected by an observer, through field notes, and were analyzed with content analysis. A face scale was used to assess PwD's mood. Thirteen PwD were observed for 90 hours. Four thematic areas were identified: (a) Unmet Fundamental Patient Needs, (b) Human Right to Dignity and Respect, (c) Communication Deficiencies, and (d) Implementation of Nursing Interventions. Nurse-patient contact lasted from 5 to 7 minutes and numerous care omissions were noted. The face scale assessment revealed that most PwD looked very sad after nursing care. This study enriches insight for the care of PwD during hospitalization and emphasizes the need for health care workers' education and support.

The purpose of this article is to describe the data acquisition process from bedside to the research electronic database. DESIGN Descriptive report and analysis of a prospective database. SETTING A 24-bed PICU, medical ICU, surgical ICU, and cardiac ICU in a tertiary care free-standing maternal child health center in Canada. PATIENTS All patients less than 18 years old were included at admission to the PICU. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Between May 21, 2015, and December 31, 2016, 1,386 consecutive PICU stays from 1,194 patients were recorded in the database. Data were prospectively collected from admission to discharge, every 5 seconds from monitors and every 30 seconds from mechanical ventilators and infusion pumps. These data were linked to the patient's electronic medical record. The database total volume was 241 GB. The patients' median age was 2.0 years (interquartile range, 0.0-9.0). Data were available for all mechanically ventilated patients (n = 511; recorded duration, 77,678 hr), and respiratory failure was the most frequent reason for admission (n = 360). The complete pharmacologic profile was synched to database for all PICU stays. Following this implementation, a validation phase is in process and several research projects are ongoing using this high-fidelity database. CONCLUSIONS Using the existing bedside information system and network architecture of our PICU, we implemented an ongoing high-fidelity prospectively collected electronic database, preventing the continuous loss of scientific information. This offers the opportunity to develop research on clinical decision support systems and computational models of cardiorespiratory physiology for example.","Brossier, David; El Taani, Redha; Sauthier, Michael; Roumeliotis, Nadia; Emeriaud, Guillaume; Jouvet, Philippe",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,827,24

METHODS Eighty cases of refractory PPH were enrolled and retrospective analyzed in this study for further analysis from a consecutive single center database between 2010 and 2018. After undergoing circular suture of the uterine serosa and myometrium layer around placental attachment site, surgical and perioperative outcomes were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS Among all the patients enrolled, 28 cases (35.0%) of refractory PPH were mainly caused by uterine inertia, 36 cases (45.0%) caused by ectopic placenta, and 2 cases (2.5%) caused by coagulation disorders. After circular suture of the uterine serosa and myometrium layer at placental attachment site, all the uterine active bleeding was controlled below 40 ml without recurrence. The perioperative results were similar between the vaginal and cesarean sections groups. CONCLUSIONS Circular suture of the uterine serosa and myometrium at the placental attachment site could control refractory PPH with few postoperative complications. Circular suture around placenta site could be applied in time to protect the endometrium even in primary hospital.","Shi, Xueqin; Wu, Han; Liu, Changyue; Zhu, Xiaoyan",The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,827,17

ANIMALS 94 Holstein calves. PROCEDURES To assess the association between BRD and antibody titers, 38 calves < 3 months old that were treated for BRD were matched with 38 untreated calves. To investigate the effect of vaccination on antibody titers, 24 calves were randomly assigned to be vaccinated against bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 and 2, bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV1), and parainfluenza virus type 3 at 2 weeks of age (n = 6), 5 weeks of age (6), and both 2 and 5 weeks of age (6) or were assigned to be unvaccinated controls (6). Blood samples were obtained at I, 2, 5, and 12 weeks for determination of serum neutralization antibody titers against the vaccine viruses, bovine coronavirus, and Mannheimia haemolytica. Antibody rates of decay were calculated. RESULTS Calves with initial antibody titers against BRSV < 1:64 that were treated for BRD had a slower rate of anti-BRSV antibody decay than did similar calves that were not treated for BRD. Calves with high initial antibody titers against BRSV and BHV1 had lower odds of BRD than did calves with low initial antibody titers against those 2 pathogens. Vaccination at 2 or 5 weeks of age had no effect on the rate of antibody decay.

IBD is considered to be a risk factor for developing osteoporosis; however current literature on this matter is inconsistent. AIM To assess prevalence and development of osteoporosis and low bone mineral density (BMD), and its risk factors, in IBD patients. METHODS Systematic review of population-based studies. Studies were identified by electronic (January 2018) and manual searches (May 2018). Databases searched included EMBASE and PubMed and abstracts from 2014-2018 presented at the United European Gastroenterology Week, the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation congress, and Digestive Disease Week were screened. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they investigated either the prevalence of osteoporosis or osteopenia and/or risk factors for osteoporosis or low BMD in IBD patients. Studies on children under the age of 18 were excluded. Only population-based studies were included. All risk factors for osteoporosis and low BMD investigated in any included article were considered. Study quality and the possibility of bias were analysed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. RESULTS Twelve studies including 3661 IBD patients and 12789 healthy controls were included. Prevalence of osteoporosis varied between 4%-9% in studies including both CD and UC patients; 2%-9% in studies including UC patients, and 7%-15% in studies including CD patients. Among healthy controls, prevalence of osteoporosis was 3% and 10% in two studies. CD diagnosis, lower body mass index (BMI), and lower body weight were risk factors associated with osteoporosis or low BMD. Findings regarding gender showed inconsistent results. CD patients had an increased risk for osteoporosis or low BMD over time, while UC patients did not. Increased age was associated with decreased BMD, and there was a positive association between weight and BMI and BMD over time. Great heterogeneity was found in the included studies in terms of study methodologies, definitions and the assessment of osteoporosis, and only a small number of population-based studies was available. CONCLUSION This systematic review found a possible increase of prevalence of osteoporosis in CD cohorts when compared to UC and cohorts including both disease types. Lower weight and lower BMI were predictors of osteoporosis or low BMD in IBD patients. The results varied considerably between studies.","Kärnsund, Sofia; Lo, Bobby; Bendtsen, Flemming; Holm, Jakob; Burisch, Johan",World journal of gastroenterology,827,7

Barrett oesophagus, the replacement of the normal squamous epithelia with glandular cells, is the first step in the pathway towards OAC. Although most patients with OAC present de novo, the presence of the easily detectable OAC precursor lesion, Barrett oesophagus, enables the possibility of early detection of high-risk patients who are more likely to progress. Currently, identification of high-risk patients depends on histopathological assessment of dysplasia with no regards to molecular pathogenesis. In the future, screening and risk stratification initiatives for Barrett oesophagus that incorporate molecular profiles might permit improved early diagnosis and intervention strategies with the possibility of preventing OAC. For the majority of patients presenting de novo at an advanced stage, combining so-called -omics datasets with current clinical staging algorithms might enable OACs to be better classified according to distinct molecular programmes, thereby leading to better targeted treatment strategies as well as cancer monitoring regimes. This Review discusses how the latest advances in -omics technologies have improved our understanding of the development and biology of OAC, and how this development might alter patient management in the future.","Weaver, Jamie M J; Ross-Innes, Caryn S; Fitzgerald, Rebecca C",Nature reviews.

Two years later, proteinuria occurred, and the urinary protein level increased gradually in the next 3 years. Moreover, the serum creatinine level increased mildly during this period. The urinary protein level reached 2.18 g/gCr; hence, a renal biopsy was conducted. Light microscopy revealed mild proliferation of mesangial cells, and immunofluorescence analysis revealed IgG and C3 depositions in the mesangial area. Electron microscopy revealed electron-dense deposition in the paramesangial area, partial podocyte foot process effacement, and segmental endothelial cell swelling with a slight expansion of the subendothelial space. Dasatinib was discontinued, and within 3 weeks, the proteinuria disappeared, with improvements in her renal function. After switching to bosutinib, a new second-generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor, the proteinuria remained negative. The rapid cessation of proteinuria following dasatinib discontinuation indicated that proteinuria was induced by the long-term administration of dasatinib. Proteinuria and renal function should be regularly monitored during dasatinib therapy.","Koinuma, Kana; Sakairi, Toru; Watanabe, Yoshikazu; IIzuka, Azusa; Watanabe, Mitsuharu; Hamatani, Hiroko; Nakasatomi, Masao; Ishizaki, Takuma; Ikeuchi, Hidekazu; Kaneko, Yoriaki; Hiromura, Keiju",CEN case reports,827,25

Past reviews on FNPs have focused on chemical, physical or medical uses, making the extrapolation to biological applications difficult. In biology, FNPs have largely been used for biosensing and molecular tracking. However, concerns over toxicity in early types of FNPs, such as cadmium-containing quantum dots (QDs), may have prevented wide adoption. Recent developments, especially in non-Cd-containing FNPs, have alleviated toxicity problems, facilitating the use of FNPs for addressing ecological, physiological and molecule-level processes in biological research. Standardised protocols from synthesis to application and interdisciplinary approaches are critical for establishing FNPs in the biologists' tool kit. Here, we present an introduction to FNPs, summarise their use in biological applications, and discuss technical issues such as data reliability and biocompatibility. We assess whether biological research can benefit from FNPs and suggest ways in which FNPs can be applied to answer questions in biology. We conclude that FNPs have a great potential for studying various biological processes, especially tracking, sensing and imaging in physiology and ecology.","Färkkilä, Sanni M A; Kiers, E Toby; Jaaniso, Raivo; Mäeorg, Uno; Leblanc, Roger M; Treseder, Kathleen K; Kang, Zhenhui; Tedersoo, Leho",Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,827,8

The COVID-19 pandemic has crippled health systems, exacerbated household food insecurity, and reversed economic growth, which together could set back improvements in undernutrition across low-income and middle-income countries. This paper highlights how the evidence base for nutrition, health, food systems, social protection, and water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions has evolved since the 2013 Lancet Series on maternal and child nutrition and identifies the priority actions needed to regain and accelerate progress within the next decade. Policies and interventions targeting the first 1000 days of life, including some newly identified since 2013, require renewed commitment, implementation research, and increased funding from both domestic and global actors. A new body of evidence from national and state-level success stories in stunting reduction reinforces the crucial importance of multisectoral actions to address the underlying determinants of undernutrition and identifies key features of enabling political environments. To support these actions, well-resourced nutrition data and information systems are essential. The paper concludes with a call to action for the 2021 Nutrition for Growth Summit to unite global and national nutrition stakeholders around common priorities to tackle a large, unfinished undernutrition agenda-now amplified by the COVID-19 crisis.","Heidkamp, Rebecca A; Piwoz, Ellen; Gillespie, Stuart; Keats, Emily C; D'Alimonte, Mary R; Menon, Purnima; Das, Jai K; Flory, Augustin; Clift, Jack W; Ruel, Marie T; Vosti, Stephen; Akuoku, Jonathan Kweku; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A",Lancet,827,16

Several meshes have been developed to minimize this process. In this experimental study, the ability of different combined meshes to attenuate the adhesion formation was examined. METHODS Three commercially available lightweight porous combined meshes were placed intraperitoneally to repair an abdominal wall defect in rats: DynaMesh-IPOM (PVDF + PP), TiMesh (titanium-coated filament PP) and C-QUR/FX (omega-3 fatty acid-coated filament PP). The DynaMesh-CICAT (PVDF) was implanted in the control group. Adhesion formation was macroscopically evaluated and scored after 7 and 21 days. RESULTS All animals except two presented intra-abdominal adhesions. None of the meshes examined in the study demonstrated to prevent adhesions. C-QUR/FX reduced adhesion formation at 7 days' follow-up compared with all other meshes but by 21 days this effect was diminished. Between 7 and 21 days adhesion extension significantly decreased for TiMesh. TAS did not show significant modifications between 7 and 21 days' follow-up for each mesh. CONCLUSIONS The combined porous meshes tested in the present study demonstrated to reduce but not to prevent the adhesion formation, even if with some differences. Combined porous meshes could be chosen instead of simple meshes for retro-rectus preperitoneal prosthetic ventral hernia repair.","D'Amore, L; Ceci, F; Mattia, S; Fabbi, M; Negro, P; Gossetti, F",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,827,7

The pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and drug interactions of the combination are well understood, but the use of a combined PK and PD model to control target-controlled infusion pumps has not been investigated. In this study, we prospectively tested the accuracy of a PD target-controlled infusion algorithm for propofol and remifentanil using a response surface model of their combined effects on Bispectral Index (BIS). METHODS Effect-site, target-controlled infusions of propofol and remifentanil were given using an algorithm based on standard PK models linked to a PD response surface model of their combined effects on BIS. The combination of a targeted BIS value and adjustable ratio of propofol to remifentanil was used to adjust infusion rates. The standard model performance measures of median performance error (bias) and median absolute performance error (inaccuracy), expressed as percentages, were used to assess accuracy of the infusions in a convenience sample of 50 adult patients undergoing surgery with general anesthesia. The influence of age and weight on the performance of the model was also assessed. RESULTS Patients had a mean (range) age of 48 (19-73) years, weight of 80 (45-169) kg, and body mass index of 28 (19-45) kg/m. The overall model had a bias of 8% (SD 24%) and inaccuracy of 25% (SD 13%). Performance was least accurate during the early induction phase of anesthesia. There was no significant bias in BIS predictions with increasing age (P = 0.44) or weight (P = 0.56). CONCLUSIONS The algorithm performed adequately in a clinical setting. The algorithm could be further refined, and assessment of its accuracy and utility in comparison to current clinical practice for giving IV anesthesia is warranted.","Short, Timothy G; Hannam, Jacqueline A; Laurent, Stephen; Campbell, Douglas; Misur, Martin; Merry, Alan F; Tam, Yuk Ho",Anesthesia and analgesia,827,1

The study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of Solitaire AB device as a rescue therapy for severe thromboembolic complications in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between February 2013 and April 2016, 1047 intracranial aneurysms treated with endovascular procedures were retrospectively reviewed in our center. Severe thromboembolisms occurred in ten patients and were treated by Solitaire AB device including clot retriever and permanent stent deployment. RESULTS The location of arterial occlusion was distal to the aneurysm rather than the coil/parent artery interface or in-stent area. Four patients had distal thromboembolic events before coil embolization, and six patients had it after coiling. The complete arterial recanalization (TICI 3) was achieved in all patients, and no cerebral hemorrhage was related to the procedure after the rescue therapy. Among these patients with the aforementioned neurovascular procedures, the mean Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score was 4.5 (ranging 3-5) and eight cases had good outcome with a score of GOS 4-5 at discharge, while eight patients presented mRS ≤2 at 3-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate that mechanical recanalization using Solitaire AB device seems to be effective and safe as a rescue therapy for severe thromboembolic events during cerebral aneurysm embolization.","Shao, Qiuji; Zhu, Liangfu; Li, Tianxiao; Li, Li; He, Yingkun; Chang, Kaitao; Liang, Xiaodong",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,827,30

EV71 infections increase the production of many host cytokines and pro-inflammatory factors, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 and COX-2. Some of these molecules could stimulate the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which plays a key role in regulating host immune responses and several viral diseases. However, the role of STAT3 in EV71 infection remains unknown. This study found that the phosphorylation levels of STAT3 (pY705-STAT3) are closely related to EV71 infection. Further experiments revealed that STAT3 exerts an anti-EV71 activity. However, the antiviral activity of STAT3 is partially antagonized by EV71-induced miR-124, which directly targets STAT3 mRNA. Similarly, IL-6R, the α-subunit of the IL-6 receptor complex, exhibits anti-EV71 activity and is directly targeted by the virus-induced miR-124. These results indicate that EV71 can evade host IL-6R- and STAT3-mediated antiviral activities by EV71-induced miR-124. This suggests that controlling miR-124 and the downstream targets, IL-6R and STAT3, might benefit the antiviral treatment of EV71 infection.","Chang, Zhangmei; Wang, Yan; Bian, Liang; Liu, Qingqing; Long, Jian-Er",The Journal of general virology,827,9

There is growing evidence that such patients are at higher risk for medication-induced adverse events. Furthermore, frailty seems to be more predictive of poor clinical outcomes than chronological age alone. To our knowledge, no systematic review of clinical trials examining drug therapy of AD or behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) has specifically focused on the topic of physical frailty. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy in AD patients with frailty or significant functional impairments. METHODS We performed a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of drug therapy of AD and BPSD in patients with significant functional impairments according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and Cochrane research criteria. Significant functionally impaired patient populations were identified using the recommendations of the Medication and Quality of Life in frail older persons (MedQoL) Research Group. Screening, selection of studies, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. Outcomes including functional status, cognitive function, changes in BPSD symptoms, clinical global impression and quality of life were analysed. For assessing harm, we assessed adverse events, drop-outs as a proxy for treatment tolerability and death. Results were analysed according to Cochrane standards and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS Of 45,045 search results, 38,447 abstracts and 187 full texts were screened, and finally, 10 RCTs were included in the systematic review. Selected articles evaluated pharmacotherapy with acetylcholinesterase-inhibitors (AChEI), anticonvulsants, antidepressants and antipsychotics. Studies of AChEIs suggested that patients with significant functional impairments had slight but significant improvements in cognition and that AChEIs were generally well tolerated. Studies of antidepressants did not show significant improvements in depressive symptoms. Antipsychotics and anticonvulsants showed small effects on some BPSD items but also higher rates of adverse events. However, due to the very small number of identified trials, the quality of evidence for all outcomes was low to very low. Overall, the small number of eligible studies demonstrates that significantly functional impaired older patients have not been adequately taken into consideration in most clinical trials investigating drug therapy of AD and BPSD. CONCLUSION Due to lack of evidence, it is not possible to give specific recommendations for drug therapy of AD and BSPD in frail older patients or older patients with significant functional impairments.

Acquiring consistent, high-quality data in such large-scale studies is challenging because of normal variations in instrumentation performance over time, as well as artifacts introduced by the samples themselves, such as those because of collection, storage and processing. Existing quality control methods for proteomics data primarily focus on post-hoc analysis to remove low-quality data that would degrade downstream statistics; they are not designed to evaluate the data in near real-time, which would allow for interventions as soon as deviations in data quality are detected. In addition to flagging analyses that demonstrate outlier behavior, evaluating how the data structure changes over time can aide in understanding typical instrument performance or identify issues such as a degradation in data quality because of the need for instrument cleaning and/or re-calibration. To address this gap for proteomics, we developed Quality Control Analysis in Real-Time (QC-ART), a tool for evaluating data as they are acquired to dynamically flag potential issues with instrument performance or sample quality. QC-ART has similar accuracy as standard post-hoc analysis methods with the additional benefit of real-time analysis. We demonstrate the utility and performance of QC-ART in identifying deviations in data quality because of both instrument and sample issues in near real-time for LC-MS-based plasma proteomics analyses of a sample subset of The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young cohort. We also present a case where QC-ART facilitated the identification of oxidative modifications, which are often underappreciated in proteomic experiments.","Stanfill, Bryan A; Nakayasu, Ernesto S; Bramer, Lisa M; Thompson, Allison M; Ansong, Charles K; Clauss, Therese R; Gritsenko, Marina A; Monroe, Matthew E; Moore, Ronald J; Orton, Daniel J; Piehowski, Paul D; Schepmoes, Athena A; Smith, Richard D; Webb-Robertson, Bobbie-Jo M; Metz, Thomas O",Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,827,1

Patients with arthritis of the knee frequently seek care, and depending on arthritis severity and impact on daily life, joint arthroplasty may be considered as a treatment option. We will conduct a systematic review of shared decision-making trials in knee arthroplasty to determine the types of shared decision-making approaches used and their impact on care received. METHODS Our systematic review will describe and critically appraise shared decision approaches used in randomized trials of patients undergoing knee arthroplasty, the types of outcomes reported, and the impact of these approaches on the patients' care. We will use the following databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library, from inception through December 2018. Additionally, we will assess ongoing research by querying experts and searching trial registries. DISCUSSION This study will characterize shared decision-making (SDM) approaches in knee arthroplasty randomized clinical trials and will summarize their effects of SDM on clinical and patient-reported outcomes. We anticipate this review will bring to light knowledge gaps and inform further research into the design and use of shared decision-making approaches in lower extremity arthroplasty.

We report the feasibility of a novel NOTES assisted technique for unlimited length, clean, endolumenal proctocolectomy in a porcine model. This technique is a modification of a transanal intussusception and pull-through procedure recently published by our group. Rectal mobilization was achieved laparoscopically; this was followed by a transanal recto-rectal intussusception and pull-through (IPT). IPT was established in a stepwise fashion. First, the proximal margin of resection was attached laparoscopically to the shaft of the anvil of an end-to-end circular stapler with a ligature around the rectum. Second, this complex was pulled transanally to produce IPT. To achieve an unlimited-length proctocolectomy, the IPT step was repeated several times prior to bowel resection. This was facilitated by removing the ligature applied in the first step of this procedure. Once sequential IPT established the desired length of bowel to be resected, a second ligature was placed around the rectum approximating the proximal and distal resection margins. The specimen was resected and extracted by making a full-thickness incision through the 2 bowel walls. The anastomosis was achieved by deploying the stapler. The technique was found to be feasible. Peritoneal samples, collected after transanal specimen extraction, did not demonstrate bacterial growth. The minimally invasive nature of this evolving technique as well as its aseptic bowel manipulation has the potential to limit the complications associated with abdominal wall incision and surgical site infection.","Kvasha, Anton; Khalifa, Muhammad; Biswas, Seema; Hamoud, Mohamad; Nordkin, Dmitri; Bramnik, Zakhar; Willenz, Udi; Farraj, Moaad; Waksman, Igor",Surgical innovation,827,8

The neoplastic lymphocyte-predominant cells typically express bright CD20 and other B-cell antigens, which distinguishes them from Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg cells of lymphocyte-rich classic Hodgkin lymphoma. OBJECTIVE.— To characterize the clinicopathologic features of CD20-negative NLPHL at a single institution. DESIGN.— A retrospective search for CD20-negative NLPHL in our pathology archives and medical records was conducted. RESULTS.— Of 486 NLPHL patients identified with CD20 available for review, 14 (2.8%) had LP cells with absent CD20 expression. Patients with prior rituximab administration (n = 7) and insufficient clinical history (n = 1) were excluded, leaving 6 patients with rituximab-naïve, CD20-negative NLPHL. A broad immunohistochemical panel showed the LP cells in all cases expressed B-cell antigens, particularly Oct-2, although PAX5 and CD79a were frequently also dim. CD30, CD15, and Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNAs were negative in all evaluated cases. Two patients had high-risk variant immunoarchitectural pattern D. One patient had extranodal disease, involving the spleen and bone, and was suspected to have large cell transformation. Standard NLPHL therapy was given, including local radiation and/or chemotherapy. Of 5 patients with available follow-up, 4 are alive in complete remission after therapy, and 1 is alive with relapsed disease. CONCLUSIONS.— NLPHL can lack CD20 de novo without prior rituximab therapy. In such cases, extensive immunophenotyping helps distinguish NLPHL from lymphocyte-rich classic Hodgkin lymphoma, which differ in clinical behavior and therapy. In our series, CD20-negative NLPHL showed both classic and variant histologic patterns and the expected range of clinical behavior seen in NLPHL, including 1 case with suspected large cell transformation.","Menke, Joshua R; Spinner, Michael A; Natkunam, Yasodha; Warnke, Roger A; Advani, Ranjana H; Gratzinger, Dita A",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,827,31

Significant impact of climate change is seen in the form of rise in temperature called as global warming. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are the primary greenhouse gases (GHGs) mainly responsible for the global warming and climate change. These GHGs have drawn lot of attention due to their significant role in the global warming potential. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested to stop global warming at 1.5oC above preindustrial levels as warming beyond this level might lead to heat extremes, alter insect and plant phenology (Phenological shifts) and more occurrence of vector borne diseases. Climate change is the topic of interest in all fields of life starting from social science and going to the applied science. Global climate cycles and world food production systems are under threat due to the recent climate extreme events. These events include heat waves and change in the rainfall patterns. Thus, risk reduction intervention in the form of mitigation and adaptation is required to minimize the impacts of climate change. Mitigation option includes understanding the present and future components of the climate system and interaction among them through coupled modeling system i.e. Global Circulation Model (GCM). Finally, global issue of climate change could be addressed by taking worldwide cooperation and action and adopting sustainable measures like use of alternative energy sources. The visible benefit on recovery of climate has been seen recently through global lockdown against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Ahmed, Mukhtar",The Science of the total environment,827,16

The goal of surgical or endovascular intervention is complete obliteration of the fistulous connection(s). In cases where dAVF venous drainage is separate from normal cortical drainage, transvenous embolization can provide fast and effective fistula obliteration. OBJECTIVE To describe a new method of efficient transvenous embolization (the 'dual microcatheter technique') for the treatment of dAVFs. METHODS Three patients with dAVFs were treated using the dual microcatheter technique for transvenous embolization. Two microcatheters were placed in the distal aspect of the dAVF venous pouch, after which coil embolization reduced fistula flow, and liquid embolic agent injection with reflux into arterial feeders completed the obliteration of the fistula. RESULTS Lesion grade ranged from Borden-Shucart grades 2 through 3. In all cases, dAVF venous drainage was isolated from the normal cerebral venous drainage. Dual microcatheter transvenous embolization was successful in all patients, with non-target embolization and no new postoperative deficits. At the last follow-up, all three patients were symptom-free without evidence of radiographic recurrence. CONCLUSIONS The dual microcatheter technique of transvenous dAVF embolization is safe and feasible in cases where dAVF venous outflow is isolated from normal cerebral venous drainage.","Abecassis, Isaac Josh; Nerva, John D; Ghodke, Basavaraj V; Sekhar, Laligam N; Levitt, Michael R; Kim, Louis J",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,827,1

METHODS We reviewed the COVID-19 vaccination guidance for pregnant and breastfeeding women published to date and evidence from preclinical experimental and observational clinical studies, and discuss their implications. RESULTS Pregnant women were excluded from the initial phase 3 clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines resulting in limited data on their efficacy and safety during pregnancy and postpartum. As a result, since December 2020, there has been conflicting advice from public health, governmental, and professional authorities on this matter. From the end of 2020 up to now, some consensus guidance has been published with a prevalent precautionary approach on the administration of vaccines in pregnant women, in breastfeeding ones, or for those who are planning a pregnancy (either spontaneously or with assisted technologies). After the first few months of vaccine administration in some countries, more permissiveness seems to prevail, although with inconsistencies. At the moment, the results obtained by preclinical experimental and observational clinical studies suggest that the risks of the maternal COVID-19 outweigh the undocumented and hypothetical risks of the COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy. Also, until two viral vector COVID-19 vaccines were associated with very rare thromboembolic events, all guidance had agreed that all approved COVID-19 vaccines could be administered in pregnancy. Actually, some concern has been expressed. CONCLUSION COVID-19 vaccines administered in pregnancy can reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 and their serious consequences for mothers and their offspring. However, many aspects remain to be clarified.","Brillo, Eleonora; Tosto, Valentina; Gerli, Sandro; Buonomo, Ersilia","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",827,0

To save time, personnel, and financial resources, rapid reviews streamline the methodological steps of the systematic review process. We aimed to explore the validity of a rapid review approach that combines a substantially abbreviated literature search with a single-reviewer screening of abstracts and full texts using three case studies. METHODS We used a convenience sample of three ongoing Cochrane reviews as reference standards. Two reviews addressed oncological topics and one addressed a public health topic. For each of the three topics, three reviewers screened the literature independently. Our primary outcome was the change in conclusions between the rapid reviews and the respective Cochrane reviews. In case the rapid approach missed studies, we recalculated the meta-analyses for the main outcomes and asked Cochrane review authors if the new body of evidence would change their original conclusion compared with the reference standards. Additionally, we assessed the sensitivity of the rapid review approach compared with the results of the original Cochrane reviews. RESULTS For the two oncological topics (case studies 1 and 2), the three rapid reviews each yielded the same conclusions as the Cochrane reviews. However, the authors would have had less certainty about their conclusion in case study 2. For case study 3, the public health topic, only one of the three rapid reviews led to the same conclusion as the Cochrane review. The other two rapid reviews provided insufficient information for the authors to draw conclusions. Using the rapid review approach, the sensitivity was 100% (3 of 3) for case study 1. For case study 2, the three rapid reviews identified 40% (4 of 10), 50% (5 of 10), and 60% (6 of 10) of the included studies, respectively; for case study 3, the respective numbers were 38% (8 of 21), 43% (9 of 21), and 48% (10 of 21). CONCLUSIONS Within the limitations of these case studies, a rapid review approach that combines abbreviated literature searches with single-reviewer screening may be feasible for focused clinical questions. For complex public health topics, sensitivity seems to be insufficient.","Affengruber, Lisa; Wagner, Gernot; Waffenschmidt, Siw; Lhachimi, Stefan K; Nussbaumer-Streit, Barbara; Thaler, Kylie; Griebler, Ursula; Klerings, Irma; Gartlehner, Gerald",Systematic reviews,827,1

This is because also in pre-clinical evaluation they are less effective in the support of nerve regeneration over critical defect lengths.

We evaluated here a modified hyaluronic acid-laminin-hydrogel (M-HAL) as luminal filler for two clinically approved hollow nerve guides. Collagen-based and chitosan-based nerve guides were filled with M-HAL in two different concentrations and the regeneration outcome comprehensively studied in the acute repair rat sciatic nerve 15 mm critical defect size model. Autologous nerve graft (ANG) repair served as gold-standard control. At 120 days post-surgery, all ANG rats demonstrated electrodiagnostically detectable motor recovery. Both concentrations of the hydrogel luminal filler induced improved regeneration outcome over empty nerve guides. However, neither combination with collagen- nor chitosan-based nerve guides resulted in functional recovery comparable to the ANG repair. In contrast to our previous studies, we demonstrate here that M-HAL slightly improved the overall performance of either empty nerve guide type in the critical defect size model.","Huang, Zhong; Kankowski, Svenja; Ertekin, Ella; Almog, Mara; Nevo, Zvi; Rochkind, Shimon; Haastert-Talini, Kirsten",International journal of molecular sciences,827,8

The Zn porphyrin dyad showed a high turnover number for CO production compared with the free-base porphyrin dyad, suggesting that the central Zn ion of porphyrin plays an important role in suppressing electron accumulation on the porphyrin part and achieving high durability of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using both TEA and BIH. The effect of acids on the CO 2 reduction was investigated using the Zn porphyrin-Re dyad and BIH.

We describe and report preliminary experience with a provocative maneuver, i.e. 90-degree elevation of the head of bed for 30 min, which stresses collaterals and facilitates decision-making. METHODS A prospective cohort study of <7.5 h of acute anterior circulation territory ischemia patients with minimal deficits despite middle cerebral artery (MCA) or internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusive disease. RESULTS Five patients met the study entry criteria. Their mean age was 78.4 years (range 65-93). All presented with substantial deficits (median NIHSS score 11, range 5-22), but improved while in supine position during initial imaging to normal or near-normal (NIHSS score 0-2). MRA showed persistent M1 MCA occlusions in 4, critical ICA stenosis or occlusion in 1, and substantial perfusion-diffusion mismatch in all. To evaluate the potential for eventual collateral failure, patients were placed in a head of bed upright posture. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were unchanged. Two showed no neurologic worsening and were treated with supportive care with excellent final outcome. Three showed worsening, including recurrent hemiparesis and aphasia at the 6th, recurrent aphasia at the 23rd, and recurrent hemineglect at the 15th upright minute. These 3 underwent endovascular recanalization therapies with successful reperfusion and excellent final outcome.

To assess the response, toxicity, and survival outcomes of EPx4, we analyzed our experience. MATERIAL AND METHODS Response and survival outcomes, selected toxicities, and adherence to chemotherapy dose and schedule were assessed in good-risk GCT patients who received EPx4 followed by adjunctive surgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between 1982 and 2016. The results were compared to our past results and recently published data. RESULTS Between 1982 and 2016, 944 GCT patients were treated with EPx4, 289 who were previously reported plus 655 treated between January 2000 and August 2016. A favorable response was achieved in 928 of 944 patients (98.3%). Five-year progression-free, disease-specific, and overall survival rates were 93.9%, 98.6%, and 97.9%, respectively. Median follow-up was 7.3 years (range, 2.8 months to 35.5 years). Viable, nonteratomatous malignant GCT was present in 3.5% of 432 post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection specimens from patients with nonseminomatous GCT. Febrile neutropenia and thromboembolic events occurred in 16.0% and 8.9%, respectively, with one treatment-related death. In the more recent 655 patient cohort, full-dose EPx4 was administered to 631 (96.3%), with deviations from planned treatment driven mainly by vascular (n=13), hematologic (n=11), renal (n=7), or infectious (n=5) events. CONCLUSION EPx4 is highly effective and well-tolerated in patients with good-risk GCT, and remains a standard of care. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE EPx4 is a standard-of-care regimen for all patients with good-risk GCT with a favorable response rate and disease-specific survival of 98%.

Cost-effective mental health screening is prerequisite for timely intervention. We developed an online tool to identify prospective predictors of PTSD and depressive symptoms in the context of co-occurring social unrest and COVID-19 in Hong Kong. 150 participants completed baseline and follow-up assessments, with a median duration of 29 days. Three logistic regression models were constructed to assess its discriminative power in predicting PTSD and depressive symptoms at one month. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was performed for each model to determine their optimal decision thresholds. Sensitivity and specificity of the models were 87.1% and 53.8% for probable PTSD, 77.5% and 63.3% for high-risk depressive symptoms, and 44.7% and 96.4% for no significant depressive symptoms. The models performed well in discriminating outcomes (AUCs range: 0.769-0.811). Probable PTSD was predicted by social unrest-related traumatic events, high rumination, and low resilience. Rumination and resilience also predicted high-risk and no significant depressive symptoms, with COVID-19-related events also predicting no significant depression risk. Accessible screening of probable mental health outcomes with good predictive capability may be important for early intervention opportunities.","Wong, Stephanie My; Hui, Christy Lm; Wong, Corine Sm; Suen, Y N; Chan, Sherry Kw; Lee, Edwin Hm; Chang, W C; Chen, Eric Yh",Psychiatry research,827,31

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to determine the latencies of vibration-induced reflexes in individuals with and without spinal cord injury (SCI), and to compare these latencies to identify differences in reflex circuitries. SETTING A tertiary rehabilitation center in Istanbul. METHODS Seventeen individuals with chronic SCI (SCI group) and 23 participants without SCI (Control group) were included in this study. Latency of tonic vibration reflex (TVR) and whole-body vibration-induced muscular reflex (WBV-IMR) of the left soleus muscle was tested for estimating the reflex origins. The local tendon vibration was applied at six different vibration frequencies (50, 85, 140, 185, 235, and 265 Hz), each lasting for 15 s with 3-s rest intervals. The WBV was applied at six different vibration frequencies (35, 37, 39, 41, 43, and 45 Hz), each lasting for 15 s with 3-s rest intervals. RESULTS Mean (SD) TVR latency was 39.7 (5.3) ms in the SCI group and 35.9 (2.7) ms in the Control group with a mean (95% CI) difference of -3.8 (-6.7 to -0.9) ms. Mean (SD) WBV-IMR latency was 45.8 (7.4) ms in the SCI group and 43.3 (3.0) ms in the Control group with a mean (95% CI) difference of -2.5 (-6.5 to 1.4) ms. There were significant differences between TVR latency and WBV-IMR latency in both the groups (mean (95% CI) difference; -6.2 (-9.3 to -3.0) ms, p = 0.0001 for the SCI group and -7.4 (-9.3 to -5.6) ms, p = 0.011 for Control group).

A thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) unit as an electron-deficient unit has been used to construct conjugated polymers for application in fullerene and non-fullerene based OSCs. TPD-based monomers can be simply prepared and TPD-polymers can be synthesized via environmentally friendly direct (hetero)arylation polymerization, providing a possibility for large quantity preparation. TPD-polymers usually have deep frontier energy levels, wide band gaps with absorption onset around 700 nm and good charge transport properties, showing the advantages of high open-circuit voltage, high fill-factor and excellent spectral matching with a small band gap non-fullerene acceptor. From the material design and synthesis and their optoelectrical properties, TPD-polymers have great potential applications in OSCs toward large-area devices. In this review, we provide an overview of TPD-polymers for OSCs in the last ten years, including the design and synthesis of TPD-polymers, and their application in fullerene and non-fullerene OSCs. We will also provide some perspective about the research of TPD-polymers that meet the requirement of OSCs. We hope that our universal summary can stimulate the study of TPD-polymers in the future, especially toward high performance, low cost and stable OSCs.","Zhao, Chaowei; Yang, Fan; Xia, Dongdong; Zhang, Zhou; Zhang, Yuefeng; Yan, Nanfu; You, Shengyong; Li, Weiwei",Chemical communications,827,1

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19) has been particularly successful in evading our evolved defenses. The outcome has been tragic-across the globe, millions have been sickened and hundreds of thousands have died. Moreover, the quarantine has radically changed the structure of our lives, with devastating social and economic consequences that are likely to unfold for years. An evolutionary perspective can help us understand the progression and consequences of the pandemic. Here, a diverse group of scientists, with expertise from evolutionary medicine to cultural evolution, provide insights about the pandemic and its aftermath. At the most granular level, we consider how viruses might affect social behavior, and how quarantine, ironically, could make us susceptible to other maladies, due to a lack of microbial exposure. At the psychological level, we describe the ways in which the pandemic can affect mating behavior, cooperation (or the lack thereof), and gender norms, and how we can use disgust to better activate native ""behavioral immunity"" to combat disease spread. At the cultural level, we describe shifting cultural norms and how we might harness them to better combat disease and the negative social consequences of the pandemic. These insights can be used to craft solutions to problems produced by the pandemic and to lay the groundwork for a scientific agenda to capture and understand what has become, in effect, a worldwide social experiment.","Seitz, Benjamin M; Aktipis, Athena; Buss, David M; Alcock, Joe; Bloom, Paul; Gelfand, Michele; Harris, Sam; Lieberman, Debra; Horowitz, Barbara N; Pinker, Steven; Wilson, David Sloan; Haselton, Martie G",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,827,31

In this study, we further investigated the nature of N protein cleavage using various methods including protease cleavage assays with or without various inhibitors and mutagenesis study. We found that PEDV 8aa infection in Vero cells leads to apoptotic cell death, and caspase 6 or 7 can cleave PEDV 8aa N protein at the late stage of the replication. The caspase-mediated cleavage occurs between D424 and G425 near the C-terminal of N protein.

Airway obstruction due to occluded cuffless tracheostomy tubes themselves remains unknown, although capping trials are commonly used before decannulation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the extent to which airway obstruction can be caused by occluded cuffless tubes in patients who underwent head and neck surgery. DESIGN Prospective Research Outcome. SETTINGS University teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS Fiftypatients requiring transient tracheostomy after head and neck surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES A flow volume loop (FVL) through the mouth using a portable spirometer, with the occluded fenestrated cuffless tube, was measured before and immediately after decannulation, by obstructing the orifice of tracheostomy tube. The measurement of FVL recordedthe forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second(FEV1 ), peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced expiratory flow at 50%of FVC, peak inspiratory flow (PIF), forced inspiratory flow at 50% of FVC. RESULTS A statistically significant difference between all spirometric parameters was found. Mean PEF and PIF respectively increased from 2.8 to 4.5 L/s (P<0.0001), and 2.3 to 2.7 L/s (P<0.01) before and after decannulation, with a strong positive correlation (r =0.7; P<0.05). A mean expiratory (34%) and inspiratory (9%) airflow reductionwas observed due to cannula. CONCLUSIONS Occluded cufflesstracheostomy tubes cause a dramatic airflow obstruction, mainly in the expiratory phase of FVL.

To understand the relationships among these unique features and the transcriptional adaptation of the organism to CO, we performed a transcriptome analysis of C. maritimus KKC1 grown under 100% CO and N2 conditions. Of its 3114 genes, 58 and 32 genes were significantly upregulated and downregulated in the presence of CO, respectively. A cooS-ech gene cluster, an ""orphan"" cooS gene, and bidirectional hyd genes were upregulated under CO, whereas hydrogen-uptake hyd genes were downregulated. Transcriptional changes in anaerobic respiratory genes supported the broad usage of electron acceptors in C. maritimus KKC1 under CO metabolism. Overall, the majority of the differentially expressed genes were oxidoreductase-like genes, suggesting metabolic adaptation to the cellular redox change upon CO oxidation. Moreover, our results suggest a transcriptional response mechanism to CO that involves multiple transcription factors, as well as a CO-responsive transcriptional activator (CooA). Our findings shed light on the diverse mechanisms for transcriptional and metabolic adaptations to CO in CO-utilizing and hydrogen-evolving bacteria.","Inoue, Masao; Izumihara, Hikaru; Fukuyama, Yuto; Omae, Kimiho; Yoshida, Takashi; Sako, Yoshihiko",Extremophiles : life under extreme conditions,827,33

SIRT2's catalytic domain has a hydrophobic tunnel where its substrate acyl groups bind. Here, we report that the fluorescent probe 1-aminoanthracene (AMA) binds within SIRT2's hydrophobic tunnel in a substrate-dependent manner. AMA's interaction with SIRT2 was characterized by its enhanced fluorescence upon protein binding (>10-fold). AMA interacted weakly with SIRT2 alone in solution (Kd = 37 μM). However, when SIRT2 was equilibrated with decanoylated peptide substrate, AMA's affinity for SIRT2 was enhanced ~10-fold (Kd = 4 μM). The peptide's decanoyl chain and AMA co-occupied SIRT2's hydrophobic tunnel when bound to the protein. In contrast, AMA binding to SIRT2 was competitive with myristoylated substrate whose longer acyl chain occluded the entire tunnel. AMA competitively inhibited SIRT2 demyristoylase activity with an IC50 of 21 μM, which was significantly more potent than its inhibition of other deacylase activities. Finally, binding and structural analysis suggests that the AMA binding site in SIRT2's hydrophobic tunnel was structurally stabilized when SIRT2 interacted with decanoylated or 4-oxononanoylated substrate, but AMA's binding site was less stable when SIRT2 was bound to acetylated substrate. Our use of AMA to explore changes in SIRT2's hydrophobic tunnel that are induced by interactions with specific acylated substrates has implications for developing ligands that modulate SIRT2's substrate specificity.","Bi, David; Yang, Jie; Hong, Jun Young; Parikh, Prashit; Hinds, Nicole; Infanti, Joseph; Lin, Hening; Weiser, Brian P",Biochemistry,827,9

The knowledge of dentists of the reported guidelines is not yet assessed and lack of awareness of these guidelines may have negative implications on dental patients. Aims The aim of this study is to assess the knowledge of dentists about COVID-19 and the MOH guidelines while treating dental patients in Saudi Arabia. Materials and Method A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey which was sent to a sample of dentists in Saudi Arabia from March to May 2020. Results A total of 294 dentists with a mean age of (36.9 ± 10.6) years completed the questionnaire. Participants included 157 females and 137 males with a range of professional classification and experience. All of the participants were aware of COVID-19, the nature of the disease, symptoms, modes of transmission and people at higher risk, except for 7.2% who did not report the correct incubation period. All participants agreed that patients and staff should wear a facial mask, use hydroalcoholic hand sanitizer upon arrival. Only 72.4% had knowledge about published guidelines. Infection control training was provided for 53% of the participants and those who had training were more confident to treat patients. Regarding personal protective equipment (PPE), putting on and taking off PPE, 64.6% and 78.6%, respectively, were aware of the guidelines. Conclusion Dentists in Saudi Arabia had optimal knowledge about COVID-19.

Generally, total Ab bridging assays combine good sensitivity with high specificity. Therefore, we developed sensitive total Ab bridging assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 Abs to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein in addition to conventional isotype-specific assays. Ab kinetics was assessed in PCR-confirmed, hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients (n = 41) and three populations of patients with COVID-19 symptoms not requiring hospital admission: PCR-confirmed convalescent plasmapheresis donors (n = 182), PCR-confirmed hospital care workers (n = 47), and a group of longitudinally sampled symptomatic individuals highly suspect of COVID-19 (n = 14). In nonhospitalized patients, the Ab response to RBD is weaker but follows similar kinetics, as has been observed in hospitalized patients. Across populations, the RBD bridging assay identified most patients correctly as seropositive. In 11/14 of the COVID-19-suspect cases, seroconversion in the RBD bridging assay could be demonstrated before day 12; nucleocapsid protein Abs emerged less consistently. Furthermore, we demonstrated the feasibility of finger-prick sampling for Ab detection against SARS-CoV-2 using these assays. In conclusion, the developed bridging assays reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 Abs in hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients and are therefore well suited to conduct seroprevalence studies.","Vogelzang, Erik H; Loeff, Floris C; Derksen, Ninotska I L; Kruithof, Simone; Ooijevaar-de Heer, Pleuni; van Mierlo, Gerard; Linty, Federica; Mok, Juk Yee; van Esch, Wim; de Bruin, Sanne; Vlaar, Alexander P J; Seppen, Bart; Leeuw, Maureen; van Oudheusden, Anne J G; Buiting, Anton G M; Jim, Kin Ki; Vrielink, Hans; Swaneveld, Francis; Vidarsson, Gestur; van der Schoot, C Ellen; Wever, Peter C; Li, Wentao; van Kuppeveld, Frank; Murk, Jean-Luc; Bosch, Berend Jan; Wolbink, Gerrit-Jan; Rispens, Theo",Journal of immunology,827,27

There is sparse information on the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Internal Medicine hospitalists. METHODS We surveyed Internal Medicine hospitalists at Mayo Clinic sites in four states (Arizona, Florida, Minnesota, and Wisconsin). We collected demographic information, and used Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) measures to assess global well-being, anxiety, social isolation, and emotional support. Descriptive statistics were used to compare responses between two periods: prior to the pandemic (before March 15th, 2020), and during the pandemic (March 15 through April 30, 2020). The survey was conducted from May 4-25, 2020. RESULTS Of 295 Internal Medicine hospitalists, 154 (52%) responded. Fifty-six percent were women (n=85/154) and 54% were physicians (n=84/154). Most hospitalists (75%; n=115/154) reported concerns about contracting COVID-19 infection at work, and 5% (n=8/154) reported changing where they lived during the pandemic. Most hospitalists (73%; n=112/154) reported relying primarily on institutional resources for COVID-19 information. During the pandemic, the percentage of participants with excellent or very good global well-being decreased (90% prior to pandemic vs. 53% during pandemic), with increases in mean anxiety (-4.88 [95% confidence interval, -5.61 to -4.16]; P<.001) and social isolation (-3.91[95% confidence interval, -4.68 to -3.13]; P<.001). During the same period, there was a small decrease in mean emotional support (1.46 [95% confidence interval, 0.83 to 2.09]; P<.001). CONCLUSION During the COVID-19 pandemic, Internal Medicine hospitalists reported lower global well-being, higher anxiety and social isolation, and a small decrease in emotional support. These results provide a framework to develop programs to support hospitalists and potentially mitigate long-term psychological sequelae including burnout.","Dugani, Sagar B; Geyer, Holly L; Maniaci, Michael J; Fischer, Karen; Croghan, Ivana; Burton, Caroline",Hospital practice,827,5

METHODS An expert-devised paper or online questionnaire was completed by members of the British Uro-oncology Group. RESULTS All respondents stated that they would offer patients with newly-diagnosed mHSPC docetaxel and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) if they were sufficiently fit to receive chemotherapy (this was the only option available at the time of the survey); 64% would strongly recommend docetaxel for those with high-volume metastatic disease and 31% for those with low-volume disease. Hypothetically, if both docetaxel and ARTAs were available in the UK for mHSPC, almost 65% of respondents would recommend an ARTA with ADT to these patients in at least one-half of all cases, with the strongest recommendations to patients with high-risk disease. Imaging for response was conducted according to suspicion of disease progression, regardless of treatment, with the minority of clinicians recommending routine imaging. If a choice of therapy was available, docetaxel would be more likely to be offered to patients with liver or lung metastases, and ARTAs to patients with bone or lymph node only metastases. Almost all respondents would offer local radiotherapy to the primary tumour in patients with low-volume disease. CONCLUSION All the UK uro-oncologists those surveyed stated that they would offer docetaxel in combination with ADT to all newly-diagnosed patients with mHSPC if fit enough for chemotherapy. ARTAs would be offered to many patients if available, especially those with high-risk disease or those unfit to receive chemotherapy.

METHODS Seven patients with ascites with unknown cause and diagnosed with vNOTES between November 2018 and May 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. The following data were collected retrospectively: body mass index, age, parity, previous abdominal or pelvic surgery, total operating time, perioperative complications and visual analog scale scores for evaluation of postoperative pain. After general anesthesia and disinfection, a 2-3 cm incision was made in the posterior fornix of the vagina. In all of the vNOTES procedures, a handmade glove port system comprised of a glove-wound retractor NOTES port was used. RESULTS Transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery for diagnostic peritoneoscopy was successfully performed in seven patients. Following postoperative pathological examination; three patients were established to have peritoneal carcinomatosis, one patient abdominal tuberculous, one patient ovarian fibroma, one patient ovarian mature cystic teratoma and one patient stomach cancer. In 1-year follow-up period after vNOTES procedure, no adverse events occurred in patients. CONCLUSION In making histological diagnosis of ascites with unknown cause, vNOTES is a feasible, safe and efficient technique. Due to its high performance in diagnosis, this technique helps to initiate treatment early in some diseases in addition to preventing unnecessary treatment and examination in benign diseases. Besides, via obtaining a detailed and enlarged image of abdominal cavity, this procedure also guides the clinician in the evaluation of the suitability of patient for operation.","Mat, Emre; Kale, Ahmet; Yıldız, Gazi; Başol, Gülfem; Gündogdu, Elif C",The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,827,1

Transanal minimally invasive surgery is a relatively new technique using a disposable port in combination with conventional laparoscopic instruments. This method is less expensive as compared with transanal endoscopic microsurgery, relatively easy to learn, and available. Despite wide adoption of transanal minimally invasive surgery, to date only a few series on the implementation and use of this technique are reported, and detailed information on the effect of transanal minimally invasive surgery on fecal continence is not available. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this work was to prospectively assess the functional outcome after transanal minimally invasive surgery using the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index preoperatively and postoperatively. DESIGN This was a prospective cohort study. SETTINGS The study was conducted at a large teaching hospital. PATIENTS Patients included those who underwent transanal minimally invasive surgery between October 2011 and September 2013. INTERVENTIONS Transanal minimally invasive surgery was studied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES We measured postoperative surgical and functional results. RESULTS A total of 37 patients underwent transanal minimally invasive surgery during our study period. Short-term morbidity rate was 14%, and positive resection margins were reported in 6 cases (16%); in 1 of these patients, a local recurrence was observed. Overall, there was a significant decline in preoperative and postoperative Fecal Incontinence Severity Index scores (p = 0.02), indicating an improvement in anorectal function after transanal minimally invasive surgery for patients with impaired preoperative continence. Seventeen patients (49%) had impaired continence before transanal minimally invasive surgery (mean Fecal Incontinence Severity Index score = 21). Continence improved in 15 (88%) of these patients after surgery; no change was observed in 1 patient (6%), and continence further decreased in another. In addition, 18 patients (51%) had normal preoperative continence (Fecal Incontinence Severity Index score = 0), of which 83% had no change in functionality, and continence decreased in 3. LIMITATIONS No quality of life was measured.

However, the current primary in vitro models in use for SARS-CoV-2 display apparent limitations for modeling such complex human respiratory disease. While patient cells can directly model the effects of a drug, their availability and capacity for expansion are limited compared to the transformed/immortalized cells or the tumor-derived cell lines. What's more, the latter may harbor genetic and metabolic abnormalities in the course of their derivation, making them unsuitable for drug screening. Therefore, it is important to create physiologically relevant human-cell models that can replicate the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2, thus, facilitating drug testing. Here, we show preliminary data on how human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)-based lung epithelial cell system could emerge as a relevant and sensitive platform for modelling SARS-CoV-2 infection and drug screening.","Surendran, Harshini; Nandakumar, Swapna; Pal, Rajarshi",Stem cells and development,827,0

A combined research strategy of in-silico analysis and gene silencing experiment was employed to investigate the role of different classes of CBLs in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) during the response to drought stress. Two different classes of CBL genes, including SlCBL3-1, and SlCBL3-2, with the minimum and a maximum number of drought-responsive cis-elements, were selected and were targeted for transient gene silencing in tomato followed by the drought treatment. The effect of silencing events was evaluated by determining of further growth and physiological traits in plants under both control and drought stress conditions. The results showed that silencing of SlCBL3-1 significantly reduced shoot and root growth, relative water content (RWC), and the concentration of pigments while increased free radical accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and leakage from the cells. On the other hand, no antioxidant enzyme activity or proline induction was triggered in plants after SlCBL3-1 silencing. Some of these adverse events were more significantly enhanced when the silenced plants were exposed to drought stress. Overall, a significant role for SlCBL3-1 in the life cycle of plant suggested under both normal and stress conditions. The SlCBL3-2 silencing showed more efficient plants recovery from silencing or drought stress conditions. Therefore, SlCBL3-2 gene may act as a negative regulator under stress conditions. The results might provide new theoretical insight and genetic resources for developing resistant crops against environmental stresses.","Hosseini Tafreshi, Seyed Ali; Aghaie, Peyman; Ebrahimi, Mohammad Ali; Haerinasab, Maryam",Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,827,16

One population that might benefit from telehealth are individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS). Although FXS is the leading inherited cause of intellectual disability, it is nonetheless a low incidence disorder. Individuals with FXS and their families are involved in research studies, clinical trials and receive interventions - many of which are only offered in a few locations in the United States and thus, not easily accessible to many families. The current project explored the feasibility of using telehealth procedures to collect multimodal behavioural and psychological assessment data from these families. METHODS Participation in the current study involved online surveys, measures of physiological indices of stress, live interviews and observations of mother-child interactions conducted via distance videoconferencing using the family's own technology when possible. Across all modes of data collection, we obtained information regarding the feasibility of participating entirely via distance by documenting missing data as well as each mother's overall impression of participating via distance. RESULTS Our telehealth procedures were successfully implemented across a wide range of technology platforms with limited difficulty, and we documented little missing data due to technology-related challenges. Perhaps most importantly, however, our sample of mothers reported high satisfaction with participating via distance. DISCUSSION These findings suggest that a wide range of services and types of assessments may be amenable to telehealth procedures. Further, the findings have immediate applications as the field shifts towards telehealth due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Bullard, Lauren; Harvey, Danielle; Abbeduto, Leonard",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,827,24

AIM We aimed to explore how care processes work and how patient safety incidents associated with GPs working in ED settings may be mitigated. DESIGN AND SETTING We used realist methodology with a purposive sample of 13 EDs with different GP service models. We sought to understand the relationship between contexts, mechanisms and outcomes to develop theories about how and why patient safety incidents may occur, and how safe care was perceived to be delivered. METHOD We collected qualitative data (observations, semi-structured audio-recorded staff interviews and local patient safety incident reports). We coded data using 'if, then, because' statements to refine initial theories developed from an earlier rapid realist literature review and analysis of a sample of national patient safety incident reports. RESULTS We developed a programme theory to describe how safe patient care was perceived to be delivered in these service models including: an experienced streaming nurse using local guidance and early warning scores; support for GPs' clinical decision-making with clear governance processes relevant to the intended role (traditional GP approach or emergency medicine approach); and strong clinical leadership to promote teamwork and improve communication between services.

An 82-year-old woman developed sudden left hemiparesis and aphasia during an urgent cardiac catheterization procedure for a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. She had a baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of at least 10 and no improvement with intravenous administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Cerebral angiography was performed with conscious sedation, confirming an occlusion of the superior division of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA). Using standard technique, a Trevo thrombectomy device was deployed across the clot. Post-thrombectomy control angiography demonstrated complete revascularization of the right MCA. The device was then gently withdrawn without difficulty. Immediately afterward the patient's blood pressure showed a sudden and significant elevation. Immediate posttreatment angiography demonstrated active extravasation from the posterior wall of the communicating segment of the right internal carotid artery. Rapid cessation of bleeding was achieved with intravenous administration of protamine and induced hypotension. Immediate neurological assessment was performed, which showed motor improvement. An immediate postintervention CT scan confirmed a moderate-sized subarachnoid hemorrhage and contrast in the prepontine cistern. The patient was discharged home on postoperative Day 3 with an NIHSS score of zero. At 6-month follow-up in the neurointerventional clinic, her NIHSS and modified Rankin Scale scores were both zero. Endovascular stent retriever devices are increasingly being used as first-line thrombectomy devices in acute embolic strokes. A unique and previously undescribed complication is vessel perforation during withdrawal of a stent retriever. Conservative treatment options and reversal of anticoagulation should be the first line of treatment for such complications. In the authors' case, performing the procedure without anesthesia was helpful in assessing the patient's neurological status.","Leishangthem, Lakshmi; Satti, Sudhakar R",Journal of neurosurgery,827,17

The diagnosis of HLH and its subtype Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) remains a challenge. Interleukin 18 (IL-18) is emerging as a potential biomarker for HLH/MAS but is currently not a part of diagnostic criteria. This systematic review aimed to assess the potential role of IL-18 in the diagnosis and monitoring of HLH and MAS. METHODS This review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed and Embase were searched on January 30th 2020. Studies included all subtypes of HLH and a range of underlying disorders in both children and adults. RESULTS A total of 14 studies were included. Generally, serum IL-18 was elevated in both primary and secondary HLH (>1,000 pg/ml) compared with other inflammatory conditions and with healthy individuals, thus serum IL-18 may be able to discriminate between HLH and other inflammatory conditions. Significantly increased IL-18 (>10,000 pg/ml) was also consistently described in MAS compared with other subtypes of HLH. The ability of IL-18 to distinguish MAS from systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is less unambiguous, as IL-18 levels >100,000 pg/ml was described in sJIA patients both with and without MAS. CONCLUSION IL-18 may help differentiate between HLH subtypes and other inflammatory conditions. Since HLH and MAS are rare disorders, only few and relatively small studies exist on the subject. Larger, prospective multi-center studies are called for to assess the diagnostic precision of IL-18 for HLH and MAS.","Krei, Julia Marie; Møller, Holger Jon; Larsen, Julie Brogaard",Clinical and experimental immunology,827,7

According to the World Health Organization, NTDs are detected annually in approximately 300,000 neonates worldwide. The exact etiology of NTDs remains complex and poorly understood. It is generally agreed that most NTD cases are of multifactorial origin, having a combination of multiple genes and a number of environmental risk factors. The role of folic acid, vitamin B12 deficiency, genetics and other risk factors, in the etiology of NTDs, have also been extensively studied. This knowledge synthesis brings together different types of evidence to update the role of vitamin B12 deficiency, genetics and other risk factors, in the etiology of NTDs. Following a PubMed search and screening for relevant articles, we included 40 studies in our review (30 case control studies, 3 cross-sectional studies, 5 cohort studies, and 2 case reports). The available data showed that vitamin B12 levels were decreased in mothers and infants in NTD groups compared to control groups. Holo-transcobalamin, the active form of vitamin B12, was also found in lower levels in mothers with NTD-affected infants. Several studies reported elevated homocysteine levels in mothers and infants in NTD groups. Additionally, numerous studies reported links between genetic variants and increased NTD risk. These genes include GIF, LRP2, CUBN, TCb1R, MTHFR, and others. Several maternal factors have also been linked with significant NTD risk such as BMI, maternal diet, air pollutants, low maternal age, and many others. The majority of studies on NTDs have focused on the role of folic acid, hence there is a need for well-designed studies on the role of other risk factors like vitamin B12 deficiency in the etiology of NTDs.","Wahbeh, Farah; Manyama, Mange",International journal of developmental neuroscience : the official journal of the International Society for Developmental Neuroscience,827,28

We hypothesized that an aggressive enteral nutrition (EN) protocol would result in higher macronutrient delivery and fewer late infections. METHODS We enrolled adult surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients receiving >72 hours of EN from July 2012 to June 2014. Our intervention consisted of increasing protein prescription (2.0-2.5 vs 1.5-2.0 g/kg/d) and compensatory feeds for EN interruption. We compared the intervention group with historical controls. To test the association of the aggressive EN protocol with the risk of late infections (defined as occurring >96 hours after ICU admission), we performed a Poisson regression analysis, while controlling for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, and exposure to gastrointestinal surgery. RESULTS The study cohort comprised 213 patients, who were divided into the intervention group (n = 119) and the historical control group (n = 94). There was no difference in age, sex, BMI, admission category, or Injury Severity Score between the groups. Mean APACHE II score was higher in the intervention group (17 ± 8 vs 14 ± 6, P = .002). The intervention group received more calories (19 ± 5 vs 17 ± 6 kcal/kg/d, P = .005) and protein (1.2 ± 0.4 vs 0.8 ± 0.3 g/kg/d, P < .001), had a higher percentage of prescribed calories (77% vs 68%, P < .001) and protein (93% vs 64%, P < .001), and accumulated a lower overall protein deficit (123 ± 282 vs 297 ± 233 g, P < .001). On logistic regression, the intervention group had fewer late infections (adjusted odds ratio, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.83). CONCLUSIONS In surgical ICU patients, implementation of an aggressive EN protocol resulted in greater macronutrient delivery and fewer late infections.","Yeh, D Dante; Cropano, Catrina; Quraishi, Sadeq A; Fuentes, Eva; Kaafarani, Haytham M A; Lee, Jarone; Chang, Yuchiao; Velmahos, George",Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition,827,1

Sorting nexin 10 (SNX10) has been reported to be an important regulator in embryonic development and human diseases, however, little is known about its role in cardiac disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of SNX10 expression in AF. METHODS Nineteen valvular heart disease patients with AF and nine valvular heart disease patients with sinus rhythm (SR) were enrolled. Atrial tissue samples from patients undergoing open heart surgery were examined. Atrial tissues of normal hearts were obtained from two cases' autopsies. The SNX10 expression and its associations with the degree of fibrosis were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Masson's trichrome staining. RESULTS SNX10 expression was detected in the cytoplasm of cardiac cells in human myocardial tissue. The SNX10 expression level was higher in the SR group than in the AF group (P=0.023). SNX10 expression was negatively associated with the degree of fibrosis (P=0.017, Spearman rho=-0.447), the New York Heart Association degree (P=0.003, Spearman rho=-0.545), left atrial diameter (P=0.038, Spearman rho=-0.393), right atrial diameter (P=0.043, Spearman rho=-0.386), and the brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level 24 hours after surgery (P=0.030, Spearman rho=-0.426), but not the BNP level before surgery and 72 hours after surgery. No statistical significance was observed between SNX10 and the level of troponin T and C-reactive protein.

Methods The same applicant selection criteria were used for both interview types. However, we modified the informal interactions with residents, campus tours, and interview formats for VC interviews. We sought to compare the 2 methods by analyzing the respective costs, benefits, and match results. Results Of 159 candidates interviewed, we ranked 127 and matched with 12. The IP (n = 135) and VC (n = 24) groups were similar in gender distribution but not by the type of medical school, with more international medical graduates interviewing by VC than IP. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 interview types for being ranked (81% of IP, 71% of VC) or matched (6% of IP, 17% of VC). US Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 and Step 2 scores and type of medical school did not affect the likelihood of being ranked or matched. Program costs per candidate were higher for the IP group ($431 for IP, $294 for VC). Conclusion Our single-center study indicates that the interview type did not affect the likelihood of a candidate being ranked by or matched to our program. Further, VC interviews were more cost-effective and time-effective than IP interviews.

The objective of this study was to determine the level of inactivation provided by hot-air drying on a Salmonella cocktail inoculated onto apple cubes and to evaluate the performance of Enterococcus faecium as a surrogate. A Salmonella cocktail ( S. Agona, S. Tennessee, S. Montevideo, S. Mbandaka and S.

Apple cubes were dried at 104°C or 135°C in ~1.5 kg batches using a hot-air dryer with a vertically directed heat source and without mixing. Three subsamples, consisting of 4 inoculated cubes, were enumerated at each time point (n ≥ 5) from multiple product bed depths. Water activity decreased throughout the duration of the study with samples at 135°C drying faster than 104°C. Samples at the bottom bed depth, closer to the heat source, dried faster than those at the higher bed depth, regardless of temperature. Significant microbial inactivation was not seen immediately. It took >10 min at the bottom bed depth or > 40 min of drying at the top bed depth, regardless of temperature (p < 0.05). By the end of drying average Salmonella inactivation of greater than 5 log CFU/sample was achieved. At temperature conditions evaluated, E. faecium inactivation was slower than Salmonella , indicating that it would likely serve as a good surrogate for in-plant validation studies. Case hardening did not inhibit microbial inactivation in the conditions tested. Hot-air drying under the conditions evaluated may provide a preventive control in the production of dehydrated products, such as apples.","Grasso-Kelley, Elizabeth; Liu, Xiyang; Halik, Lindsay; Douglas, Becky",Journal of food protection,827,1

METHODS Forty-one eyes of 41 pediatric obese participants and 41 eyes of 41 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included in this study. Body mass index was calculated, based on sex and age, using body weight and height measurements. Blood lipid values (i.e., cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride) were measured in obese participants. Optical coherence tomography was used to examine optic nerve head parameters, including rim area, disc area, cup-to-disc ratio, and cup volume, as well as the thicknesses of retinal nerve fiber layers and macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layers. RESULTS Optic disc parameters were similar in obese and healthy children (p>0.05). The percentage of binocular retinal nerve fiber layer thickness symmetry was significantly different between obese and control groups (p=0.003). Compared to the control group, participants in the obese group exhibited thinner retinal nerve fiber layers in the superior quadrants (p=0.04) and thinner ganglion cell-inner plexiform layers in the superior-temporal sectors (p=0.04). There were no statistically significant correlations between the ocular parameters and lipid blood test values assessed in this study (p>0.05).

Overall, 9308 patients were examined, with cytology results from 10,147 breasts [age (years), mean ± SD = 49.73 ± 4.09 years]. Diagnostic accuracy meta-analysis of NAF revealed a pooled specificity of 0.97 (95% CI 0.97-0.98), and sensitivity of 0.64 (95% CI 0.62-0.66). CONCLUSIONS The diagnostic accuracy of nipple smear cytology is limited by poor sensitivity. If nipple fluid assessment is to be used for diagnosis, then emerging technologies for fluid biomarker analysis must supersede the current diagnostic accuracy of NAF cytology.","Jiwa, Natasha; Gandhewar, Rishikesh; Chauhan, Hemali; Ashrafian, Hutan; Kumar, Swathica; Wright, Corrina; Takats, Zoltan; Leff, Daniel Richard",Annals of surgical oncology,827,1

Whole-brain SWI was used to detect multiple thrombus fragments, and their clinical significance was analyzed. MATERIALS AND METHODS Pretreatment SWI was analyzed for the presence of a single intracranial thrombus or multiple intracranial thrombi. Associations with baseline clinical characteristics, complications, and clinical outcome were studied. RESULTS Single intracranial thrombi were detected in 300 (92.6%), and multiple thrombi, in 24 of 324 patients (7.4%). In 23 patients with multiple thrombi, all thrombus fragments were located in the vascular territory distal to the primary occluding thrombus; in 1 patient, thrombi were found both in the anterior and posterior circulation. Only a minority of thrombus fragments were detected on TOF-MRA, first-pass gadolinium-enhanced MRA, or DSA. Patients with multiple intracranial thrombi presented with more severe symptoms (median NIHSS scores, 15 versus 11; P = .014) and larger ischemic areas (median DWI ASPECTS, 5 versus 7; P = .006); good collaterals, rated on DSA, were fewer than those in patients with a single thrombus (21.1% versus 44.2%, P = .051). The presence of multiple thrombi was a predictor of unfavorable outcome at 3 months (P = .040; OR, 0.251; 95% CI, 0.067-0.939). CONCLUSIONS Patients with multiple intracranial thrombus fragments constitute a small subgroup of patients with stroke with a worse outcome than patients with single thrombi.","Gratz, P P; Schroth, G; Gralla, J; Mattle, H P; Fischer, U; Jung, S; Mordasini, P; Hsieh, K; Verma, R K; Weisstanner, C; El-Koussy, M",AJNR.

This microcirculatory damage can be demonstrated by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The aim of this study was to compare microvascular reactivity by NIRS during a dynamic vascular occlusion test in healthy smokers and nonsmokers volunteers. Twenty healthy volunteers (10 men, 10 women), aged from 22 to 38 years old, were included after approval of the local Ethics Committee and divided into two groups: smokers (n = 10) and nonsmokers (n = 10). Tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) was measured at the level of each individual's calves during an ischemia and reperfusion test. In addition, during the ischemia phase, the slope of decline in StO2 was determined. Therefore, for each group, we were able to deduce the speed of desaturation (ΔStO2/ischemia time). The same was applied for resaturation rates during the reperfusion phase (ΔStO2/reperfusion time). StO2 values were comparable at all experimental steps between smokers and nonsmokers. During the vascular occlusion test, rates of desaturation were the same between smokers and nonsmokers [respectively 3.7%·min(-1) (range 2.5-12.6) and 3.7%·min(-1) (range 1.8-15.1); p = 0.50]. It was the same for the rate of resaturation [smokers 30.4%·min(-1) (range 14.2-51.6) and nonsmokers 30.5%·min(-1) (range 18.6-44.5); p = 0.82]. NIRS study of microvascular reactivity during a dynamic vascular occlusion test did not reveal any difference between smokers and nonsmokers. Therefore, NIRS could not be sensitive enough to highlight endothelial dysfunction in healthy subjects exposed to tobacco smoke.","Zamparini, Guillaume; Butin, Géraldine; Fischer, Marc-Olivier; Gérard, Jean-Louis; Hanouz, Jean-Luc; Fellahi, Jean-Luc",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,827,31

RECENT FINDINGS ACE2 has quickly gained prominence in basic research as it has been identified as the main entry receptor for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This novel pathogen causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pathogenic condition that reached pandemic proportion and is associated with unprecedented morbidity and mortality. SUMMARY The renin-angiotensin system is a complex, coordinated hormonal cascade that plays a pivotal role in controlling individual cell behaviour and multiple organ functions. ACE2 acts as an endogenous counter-regulator to the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways triggered by ACE through the conversion of Ang II into the vasodilatory peptide Ang 1-7. We discuss the structure, function and expression of ACE2 in different tissues. We also briefly describe the role of ACE2 as a pivotal driver across a wide spectrum of pathogenic conditions, such as cardiac and renal diseases. Furthermore, we provide the most recent data concerning the possible role of ACE2 in mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection and dictating COVID-19 severity.","Perico, Luca; Benigni, Ariela; Remuzzi, Giuseppe",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,827,26

The most reliable option has been proven to be the RT-PCR, which allows to detect virus RNA on a specimen from a high viral load site, such as nasopharynx. Nasopha-ryngeal sample collection is possible by means of a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and is a practical and relatively non-invasive technique, but rather bothersome for the recipient. Aim The aim of the present study is to evaluate the discomfort evoked during NPS. Materials and Methods We surveyed 429 patients receiving NPS before hospitalization or other procedures non related to COVID-19. For each one we noted the discomfort level felt during the swab using a 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain and the total time needed for the procedure to be taken. Sex, age, smoking status and positive history of previous swab have been taken into account. Results We found that, among the variables, sex had a statistically significant impact on the perceived discomfort of nasal swab, with females experiencing slightly more discomfort. Conclusions NPS is largely a none-to-minimum discomfort in-ducing procedure. The differences in perceived discomfort could be explained based on anatomical features, and should remark the need for a tailored and anatomy-oriented approach in each patient.","Marra, P; Colacurcio, V; Bisogno, A; De Luca, P; Calvanese, M; Petrosino, M; De Bonis, E; Troisi, D; Cassandro, C; Cavaliere, M; Ralli, M; Cassandro, E; Scarpa, A",La Clinica terapeutica,827,1

Duty can take multiple forms in the professional and private worlds of those working to save the lives of others. At times, different forms of duty create confliciting demands, necessitating some kind of sacrifice. This dilemma is not new; it was a central theme of Virgil's Aeneid, the best known epic poem of ancient Rome. Statues and paintings of a scene from this poem, in which a man carries his father on his shoulders to safety from a burning city, became the most common representation of duty in Rome after the first century BCE and were frequently copied in later ages. Examining how Virgil's poem and these images communicate the rewards, complexity, ambiguity, and costs of duty can contribute to our understanding of the experiences of those who work to heal others in this lethal pandemic.

Although skin toxicity is common during treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), osimertinib-associated TEN is quite rare-thus far, only one report has been published from China. We report a case of an 80-year-old Japanese woman with lung adenocarcinoma harboring an EGFR-sensitizing mutation who was treated with osimertinib as the first-line treatment. Forty-six days after osimertinib induction, diffuse erythematous rash rapidly spread over the patient's trunk along with vesicles and purpuric macules; furthermore, she developed targetoid erythema on the face. Despite osimertinib discontinuation and corticosteroid treatment, diffuse erythema with Nikolsky's sign, general epidermal detachment, erosion and loose blisters developed over her entire body including the face. Based on her symptoms, TEN was diagnosed and thus, intravenous immunoglobulin was immediately administered for 4 days. The treatment ameliorated TEN-associated skin toxicity and caused epithelialization.

Thus, assays for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in blood, validated on commercially available PCR systems, are required to allow a good comparability of data. MATERIAL AND METHODS The cobas SARS-CoV-2 dual-target RT-PCR assay, licensed for respiratory swab SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing, was validated for detection of viral RNA in blood. For the validation panel, SARS-CoV-2 positive plasma samples were prepared by spiking SARS-CoV-2 positive respiratory specimens in negative human plasma. The 95% limit of detection (LOD95) was determined by probit analysis. For clinical validation, COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors and COVID-19 patients with a severe disease course treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) were included. RESULTS The validation of the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay for blood demonstrated high sensitivity, specificity, intra- and inter-assay precision and efficiency. The LOD95 for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 5.0 genome copies/mL (95% CI, 3.3-12 copies/ml) for target 1 and 4.3 genome copies/mL (95% CI, 2.9-10 copies/ml) for target 2. In a cohort of 39 CCP donors with 66 CCP donations no SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma was detected. Screening of 25 blood samples of 19 ICU COVID-19 patients showed six positive results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in at least one target of the assay. CONCLUSION The SARS-CoV-2 RNA assay, only licensed for respiratory swabs, performed on a PCR system for high-throughput testing, showed a good assay performance for blood testing.","Strasser, E F; Steininger, P A; Korn, K; Achenbach, S; Tenbusch, M; Cunningham, S; Zimmermann, R; Überla, K; Hackstein, H",Transfusion,827,1

BAFF system molecules are primarily involved in B cell homeostasis. The relevance of BAFF system molecules in host responses to microbial assaults has been investigated in clinical studies and in mice deficient for each of these molecules. Many microbial products modulate the expression of these molecules. Data from clinical studies suggest a correlation between increased expression levels of BAFF system molecules and elevated B cell responses. Depending on the pathogen, heightened B cell responses may strengthen the host response or promote susceptibility. Whereas pathogen-mediated increases in the expression levels of the ligands and/or the receptors appear to promote microbial clearance, certain pathogens have evolved to ablate B cell responses by suppressing the expression of TACI and/or BAFF-R on B cells. Other than its well-established role in B cell responses, the TACI-mediated activation of macrophages is also implicated in resistance to intracellular pathogens. An improved understanding of the role that BAFF system molecules play in infection may assist in devising novel strategies for vaccine development.","Sakai, Jiro; Akkoyunlu, Mustafa",Clinical microbiology reviews,827,1

While tectonic plate motions provide evidence for this relation, the mechanism by which mantle processes influence near-surface tectonics remains elusive. Here, we present an azimuthal anisotropy model for the Pacific Northwest crust that strongly correlates with high-velocity structures in the underlying mantle but shows no association with the regional mantle flow field. We suggest that the crustal anisotropy is decoupled from horizontal basal tractions and, instead, created by upper mantle vertical loading, which generates pressure gradients that drive channelized flow in the mid-lower crust. We then demonstrate the interplay between mantle heterogeneities and lithosphere dynamics by predicting the viscous crustal flow that is driven by local buoyancy sources within the upper mantle. Our findings reveal how mantle vertical load distribution can actively control crustal deformation on a scale of several hundred kilometers.","Castellanos, Jorge C; Perry-Houts, Jonathan; Clayton, Robert W; Kim, YoungHee; Stanciu, A Christian; Niday, Bart; Humphreys, Eugene",Science advances,827,7

The large number of patients requiring intensive care threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems globally. Likewise, there is a compelling need for a COVID-19 disease severity test to prioritize care and resources for patients at elevated risk of mortality. Here, an integrated point-of-care COVID-19 Severity Score and clinical decision support system is presented using biomarker measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), N-terminus pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), myoglobin (MYO), D-dimer, procalcitonin (PCT), creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB), and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). The COVID-19 Severity Score combines multiplex biomarker measurements and risk factors in a statistical learning algorithm to predict mortality. The COVID-19 Severity Score was trained and evaluated using data from 160 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from Wuhan, China. Our analysis finds that COVID-19 Severity Scores were significantly higher for the group that died versus the group that was discharged with median (interquartile range) scores of 59 (40-83) and 9 (6-17), respectively, and area under the curve of 0.94 (95% CI 0.89-0.99). Although this analysis represents patients with cardiac comorbidities (hypertension), the inclusion of biomarkers from other pathophysiologies implicated in COVID-19 (e.g., D-dimer for thrombotic events, CRP for infection or inflammation, and PCT for bacterial co-infection and sepsis) may improve future predictions for a more general population. These promising initial models pave the way for a point-of-care COVID-19 Severity Score system to impact patient care after further validation with externally collected clinical data. Clinical decision support tools for COVID-19 have strong potential to empower healthcare providers to save lives by prioritizing critical care in patients at high risk for adverse outcomes.","McRae, Michael P; Simmons, Glennon W; Christodoulides, Nicolaos J; Lu, Zhibing; Kang, Stella K; Fenyo, David; Alcorn, Timothy; Dapkins, Isaac P; Sharif, Iman; Vurmaz, Deniz; Modak, Sayli S; Srinivasan, Kritika; Warhadpande, Shruti; Shrivastav, Ravi; McDevitt, John T",Lab on a chip,827,1

A meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the impact of AL on long-term survival. METHODS A systematic electronic search for articles was performed for studies published between 2001 and 2020 evaluating the long-term oncological impact of AL. Meta-analysis was performed using the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model to compute hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria, yielding a total of 9885 patients. Long-term survival was significantly reduced after AL (HR: 1.79, 95% CI: 1.33-2.43). AL was associated with significantly reduced overall survival in studies within hospital volume Quintile 1 (HR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.12-1.63) and Quintile 2 (HR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.35-2.47). However, no significant association was found for studies within Quintile 3 (HR: 2.24, 95% CI: 0.85-5.88), Quintile 4 (HR: 2.59, 95% CI: 0.67-10.07), and Quintile 5 (HR: 1.29, 95% CI: 0.92-1.81). AL was significantly associated with poor long-term survival in patients with associated overall Clavien Dindo Grades 1-5 (HR: 2.17, 95% CI: 1.31-3.59) and severe Clavien Dindo Grades 3-5 (HR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.14-1.78) complications. CONCLUSIONS AL has a negative prognostic impact on long-term survival after restorative resection of oesophageal cancers, particularly in low-volume centers. Future efforts must be focused on strategies to minimize the septic and immunological response to AL with early recognition and treatment thus reducing the impact on long-term survival.","Gujjuri, Rohan R; Kamarajah, Sivesh K; Markar, Sheraz R",Diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus,827,29

Under the framework of the proposed dynamic infectious disease model, we tested the impact of temperature, precipitation, state emergency order and stay home order on the spread of COVID-19 based on the United States county-wise daily counts data. Our numerical results show that warm and humid weather can significantly slow the spread of COVID-19, and the state emergency and stay home orders also help to slow it.

Case fatality rate (CFR) estimation helps understanding the disease severity and the lethality trend, high risk population and subsequently, optimization of quality healthcare facilities. Our observational study aimed to find out existing trends in treating the most vulnerable group with scarce medical resource allocation and to implement necessary support services to comply with the ensuing need for best possible outcomes in our ICU. Methodology: In this observational study, all COVID-19 diagnosed patients admitted in our ICU from July 4, 2020 to September 22, 2020, were enrolled. Data were obtained from the core ICU register of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh. Information accumulated on predesigned data sheets comprised of particulars of patients, co-morbidities, duration of ICU stay, mode of oxygenation, organ support and quick SOFA scores. Total deaths in ICU (in hospital or referred from outside of BSMMU) were recorded. Results: The results revealed that all patients were either very severe or critically sick with COVID-19 pneumonia at the time of ICU admission. Out of 174 patients, 46 (26.44%) were put on invasive ventilation and the rest received noninvasive ventilation in the form of NRM, high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP or BiPAP), CTEX CPAP and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) as appropriate. Male and female ratio was 74:26. Age of patients ranged between 19-95y. The median age of patients was 65 y (IQR: 57-70).Quick SOFA scores were more than 2 in 65.37% of patients. Regarding co-existing organ dysfunction 13.8% had 3 or more co-morbidities;while 74.1% had 2 and 9.8% had a single systemic illness along with COVID-19. Most common diseases encountered among 135 deceased were hypertension (64%), IHD (49%), diabetes mellitus (45%), bronchial asthma or COPD (32%), renal failure (either ARF or CRF) (20%). Overall CFR due to COVID-19 pneumonia associated with co-morbidities was 77.6%. Relatively higher CFR (82.6%) was evident harboring multi-organ dysfunction especially among COVID-19 patients aged 50y or more. Gender linked CFR were 81.4% and 66.7% in males and females respectively. Conclusion: High CFR demonstrates significant correlation with increasing age and co-morbidities and survival functions. Late presentation to the hospital and invasive mechanical ventilation also contributed to high CFR.","Islam, M. S.; Bhowmick, D. K.; Parveen, M.; Kamal, M. M.; Akhtaruzzaman, A. K.

Two doctors investigated keywords including coronary artery disease, COVID-19"", “coronavirus, heart disease”, “coronavirus, chest pain”, “COVID-19, heartache” and “COVID-19, heart disease”. “Coronary artery disease”, “heartache”, “chest pain” and “heart disease” are the Turkish translations for coronary artery disease, heart pain, chest pain and heart disease, respectively. Firstly, for each video, video length, number of days on Youtube, and the number of views and comments were recorded, along with the number of “likes” and “dislikes”. Sources of the videos were categorized into three groups: “health care professionals”, “new agencies” and “non-professional individuals”. Moreover, DISCERN and medical information and content index (MICI) were evaluated. Results: Finally, 92 Youtube videos met the study inclusion criteria. The present study included 36 informative videos, 34 patient experience videos and 22 news update videos, and none were categorized in the misleading group. The shortest video length was found in patient experience videos (p=0.001). The DISCERN scores of videos were 3.5±1.1 for informative videos, 1.8±0.4 for patient experience videos and 0.9±1.3 for news update videos. The statistical analyses revealed that informative videos had significantly higher DISCERN scores when compared to patient experience videos and news update videos (p=0.005 and p=0.001, respectively). The mean MICI score was 4.1±1.5 for informative videos. Conclusion: The present study showed that videos about coronary artery disease and COVID-19 are generally poor quality and low reliability.","Sevgili, E.; Baytaroglu, C.",Haseki Tip Bulteni,827,24

Since March 2020, national education systems all over the world have been adapting their activities to the quarantine measures and have been switching to distance learning. In varying degrees, these changes affected all levels of education - from preschool to higher and postgraduate education. However, the tasks to be solved differed by the level of education. The article presents the results of the comparative analysis of the activities of the Russian higher-educational institutions based on their students estimates - during the forced distance learning in the spring of 2020 and during the planned switch to such a format in the fall of 2020. The article is based on the surveys of the Russian students conducted in June 2020 (N=31423) and February 2021 (N=32358). The study was conducted to test the hypotheses that negative estimates of distance learning and rejection of such a format by many students in the spring of 2020 changed in the fall of 2020. The results of two surveys show that Russian universities have passed through the stage of digital transformation which affected both the resources for organizing the educational process and the competences of the teaching staff. The experience of work in the difficult and unpredictable conditions of the pandemic changed the public opinion from the negative perception of distance learning to understanding and accepting its positive features for the education system and its actors. The introduction of digital technologies is an objective and inevitable process in the development of the educational sphere and the country.","Aleshkovski, I. A.; Gasparishvili, A.

While this is shifting somewhat, there remains a considerable need to address the underprioritization of mental health and well-being, perhaps even more so in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, given the history of mental health interventions—which have overemphasized the biomedical model and have thus resulted in coercion, denial of life in the community, and unnecessary pathologization of human experience—there is also a need to ensure that increased funding does not simply replicate these mistakes. This is particularly true in the current landscape, where efforts to “scale up” mental health and to reduce “treatment gaps” are gaining momentum and where post-pandemic responses are still being formulated. As the potential for global mechanisms for funding mental health increases, national and international funders should look to practices that are rights affirming and contextually relevant. In this paper, I explore the current landscape of mental health financing, in terms of both national resource allocation and development assistance. I then outline the momentum in global mental health that is likely to materialize through increased funding, before considering ways in which that funding might be utilized in a manner that promotes human rights.","Mahomed, Faraaz",Health Hum Rights,827,19

An RT-PCR that amplified part of the 3' end of the viral spike (S) gene was devised to distinguish FCoV types I and II. All but 1 of 28 strains of FCoV from 43 cats were type I. Nucleotide identities of the amplified 320 bp product from 49 type I FCoVs ranged from 79 to 100 %. The consensus partial S sequence of isolates recovered from persistently infected cats at time intervals spanning years was generally conserved. While most cats were infected with a single strain, a few may have been infected by more than one strain. Cats that were transiently infected and ceased shedding could be re-infected with either the same, or a different, strain. In most cases, whether a cat became persistently or transiently infected was independent of the virus strain. However, one strain was unusual in that it infected the majority of cats in the household simultaneously and was still being shed 18 months later. Factors that influence whether FCoV establishes lifelong infection in some cats and not others are determined mainly by the host response to infection.","Addie, D D; Schaap, I A T; Nicolson, L; Jarrett, O",The Journal of general virology,827,17

In this study, we examined whether demographics predicted the likelihood that a person would adopt these behaviours in Singapore. METHODS A total of 1,145 participants responded to an online survey conducted between 7 March and 21 April 2020. We collected demographic information and asked participants to report which of 17 behaviour changes they had undertaken because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Regression analyses were performed to predict the number of behavioural changes (preventive, avoidant, and total) as a function of demographics. Finally, we sought to identify predictors of persons who declared that they had not undertaken any of these measures following the outbreak. RESULTS Most participants (97%) reported at least one behavioural change on account of the pandemic, with changes increasing with the number of local COVID-19 cases (P<0.001). Additionally, women and those who were younger adopted more preventive behaviours (gender: P<0.001; age: P=0.001). Women were more likely to increase handwashing frequency, and younger individuals were more likely to wear face masks prior to legislation. Finally, women and those who were married adopted more avoidant behaviours (gender: P<0.001; marital status: P<0.001), with both groups avoiding crowded areas and staying home more than usual. Women also voluntarily reduced physical contact, whereas those who were married preferentially chose outdoor venues and relied on online shopping. CONCLUSION Our characterisation of behavioural changes provides a baseline for public health advisories. Moving forward, health authorities can focus their efforts on encouraging segments of the population who do not readily adopt infection control measures against COVID-19.","Long, Victoria J E; Liu, Jean C J","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",827,1

Serological surveys indicate that at least 25 other species of cat possess antibodies that cross-react with domestic cat FIV. Most infected nondomestic cat species are without major symptoms of disease. Long-term studies of FIV genome variation and pathogenesis reveal patterns consistent with coadaptation of virus and host in free-ranging FIV-Ple-infected African lions (Panthera leo) and FIV-Pco-infected pumas (Puma concolor) populations. This report examined correlates of immunodeficiency in wild and captive lions and pumas by quantifying CD5(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+) T-cell subsets. Free-ranging FIV-Ple-infected lions had immunofluorescence flow cytometry (IFC) profiles marked by a dramatic decline in CD4(+) subsets, a reduction of the CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio, reduction of CD8(+)beta(high) cells, and expansion of the CD8(+)beta(low) subset relative to uninfected lions. An overall significant depletion in CD5(+) T-cells in seropositive lions was linked with a compensatory increase in total CD5(-) lymphocytes. The IFC profiles were altered significantly in 50% of the seropositive individuals examined. The FIV-Pco-infected pumas had a more generalized response of lymphopenia expressed as a significant decline in total lymphocytes, CD5(+) T-cells, and CD5(-) lymphocytes as well as a significant reduction in CD4(+) T-cells. Like lions, seropositive pumas had a significant decline in CD8(+)beta(high) cells but differed by not having compensatory expansion of CD8(+)beta(low) cells relative to controls. Results from FIV-infected lions and pumas parallel human and Asian monkey CD4(+) diminution in HIV and SIV infection, respectively, and suggest there may be unrecognized immunological consequences of FIV infection in these two species of large cats.","Roelke, M E; Pecon-Slattery, J; Taylor, S; Citino, S; Brown, E; Packer, C; Vandewoude, S; O'Brien, S J",Journal of wildlife diseases,827,1

Objective To find out the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on students from high schools, colleges and universities in Nepal, along with examining the association between socio-demographic and other related variables and level of anxiety in the students. Method This study sampled students from Nepal using convenience sampling and responded to a quantitative questionnaire that included the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and other basic information. Finally, 105 respondents were included in the final analysis (100% response rate). Convenient sampling technique was used to gather the sample. Result The results indicated that 18.1% of the respondents were experiencing severe anxiety, 22.9% moderate anxiety, and 25.7% mild anxiety. Moreover, females were more prone to anxiety as compared to males. The results of correlation analysis indicated that economic effects, and delays in academic activities, were positively associated with anxiety symptoms (p < .05). However, social support was negatively correlated with the level of anxiety (p < .001).

METHODS The authors prospectively studied 60 patients with MS. Twenty patients were evaluated with sequential MRI on initial visit, and 2 and 12 weeks later. Blood samples were collected at first infection symptom and 2, 5, 12, and 24 weeks later, and production of IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, IFN-gamma, TNFalpha, VLA-4, LFA-1, MMP-9, and MMP-2 were measured after infectious antigens (Ag) stimulation. RESULTS Increased risk of relapse and MRI activity were observed during SI. Numbers of IFN-gamma, TNFalpha, and IL-12 secreting cells, serum concentrations of MMP-9, and expression of VLA-4 and LFA-1 after PBMC viral or bacterial Ag stimulation were higher in samples collected during exacerbations associated to SI. Transwell analysis demonstrated that soluble factors produced during viral stimulation have little effect on myelin specific T cells activity. In contrast, PBMC viral stimulation in the presence of cognate myelin Ag induces maximal effector responses at 20 to 30 times lower than the Ag alone. CONCLUSIONS There was a significant association between systemic infections and risk of MS relapse, increased MRI activity, and T cells activation. Furthermore, infectious agents increased myelin specific T-cells sensitivity to cognate Ag.","Correale, Jorge; Fiol, Marcela; Gilmore, Wendy",Neurology,827,16

The clinical relevance of hBoV is still unclear. The aim of our study was to establish a real-time PCR assay for the detection and quantification of hBoV DNA, to apply the real-time assay for the analysis of stool and serum samples for the presence of hBoV DNA, and to perform a phylogenetic analysis of the hBoV positive samples. A total of 834 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA), 10 serum samples, and 31 stool samples of children with acute respiratory diseases were retrospectively tested. For phylogenetic analysis, 968 bp of the VP2 gene were sequenced from 69 hBoV-positive NPA samples. The qualitative results of the real-time hBoV PCR were in good agreement with a conventional hBoV PCR. We found that 12% of the NPA were positive for hBoV DNA. The median viral load in the NPA was 4.9 x 10(3) copies/ml (range, 2.7 x 10 degrees to 1.5 x 10(11) copies/ml). There was no difference of the hBoV load in NPA between children with or without known coinfection, but the load was significantly higher in children with bronchitis than in children with the diagnosis of febrile seizures. hBoV DNA was found in 1 of 10 serum samples and in 14 of 31 stool samples. hBoV sequence identity was >99% in the VP2 region. In conclusion, hBoV DNA can be found in NPA samples at very high titers. In addition to being found in the respiratory tract, hBoV was found in stool samples. The clinical relevance of these findings remains to be determined.","Neske, Florian; Blessing, Kerstin; Tollmann, Franz; Schubert, Jörg; Rethwilm, Axel; Kreth, Hans Wolfgang; Weissbrich, Benedikt",Journal of clinical microbiology,827,16

We have analyzed the role of the transmembrane domain (TMD) of a p24 protein isolated from COPI-coated intra-Golgi transport vesicles. CD8-p24 chimeras were transiently expressed in COS7 cells and analyzed by immunofluorescence and pulse-chase experiments. The localization and transit of the wild-type chimera from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through the Golgi complex involved a glutamic acid residue and a conserved glutamine in the TMD. The TMD glutamic acid mediated the localization of the chimeras to the ER in the absence of the conserved glutamine. Efficient ER exit required the TMD glutamine and was further facilitated by a pair of phenylalanine residues in the cytoplasmic tail. TMD residues of p24 proteins may mediate the interaction with integral membrane proteins of the vesicle budding machinery to ensure p24 packaging into transport vesicles.,"Fiedler, K; Rothman, J E",The Journal of biological chemistry,827,4

The study reported here aimed at investigating the origin of stress and psychological morbidity among frontline healthcare workers in response to this catastrophe. METHOD Self-administered questionnaires were sent to frontline healthcare workers in three hospitals. The General Health Questionnaire was used to identify psychological distress. Socio-demographic and stress variables were entered into a logistic regression analysis to find out the variables associated with psychological morbidity. RESULTS The response rate was 40 %. Sixty-eight per cent of participants reported a high level of stress. About 57 % were found to have experienced psychological distress. The healthcare workers' psychological morbidity was best understood by the perceptions of personal vulnerability, stress and support in the workplace. CONCLUSION These findings shed light on the need for hospital administrators to be aware of the extent and sources of stress and psychological distress among frontline healthcare workers during disease outbreak.","Tam, Cindy W C; Pang, Edwin P F; Lam, Linda C W; Chiu, Helen F K",Psychological medicine,827,17

Proper knowledge, perception, and practices towards COVID-19 are essential for these patients during pandemic. This study aimed to know their knowledge, perception, and practices regarding COVID-19. METHODS cross sectional study using online survey was conducted from April to May 2020. Patients with autoimmune disease were asked about demographic characteristics, diagnosis, history of treatment, knowledge, perception, and practice regarding COVID-19. RESULTS there were 685 respondents. Most of them were female and had systemic lupus erythematosus with median age of 37 years old. Almost all respondents had good knowledge regarding transmission of COVID-19 and did proper prevention practices. Adequacy of information and steroid or mycophenolate mofetil/mycophenolic acid (MMF/MPA) use were related to perception of the effect of pandemic to their own health. Visiting private clinic and receiving hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine sulfate or sulfasalazine were related to perception that autoimmune conditions would make them more prone to COVID-19. Work from home was related to perception that when contracting COVID-19, the symptoms would be more severe. Living in Sumatra region and getting hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine sulfate or MMF/MPA were related to perception that autoimmune medications could reduce risk of getting COVID-19. Adequate information, university education, private clinic visit, and hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine sulfate use were related to perception that COVID-19 pandemic would cause difficulties in getting medications. CONCLUSION almost all respondents had good knowledge and practices regarding COVID-19. Adequacy of information, autoimmune treatment, work from home, educational background, area of living, and health care facilities contributed to perception regarding COVID-19 pandemic.","Widhani, Alvina; Rengganis, Iris; Susanto, Agus Joko; Surachmanto, Eko E; Hasibuan, Anshari Saifuddin; Fetarayani, Deasy; Mulya, Deshinta Putri; Kurniati, Nova; Yunihastuti, Evy; Masri, Raveinal; Karjadi, Teguh Harjono; Koesnoe, Sukamto; Zubir, Zuhrial; Alimudin, Suriani; Estiasari, Riwanti; Safri, Ahmad Yanuar; Maria, Suzy",Acta medica Indonesiana,827,30

PURPOSE: To evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether use of ACEIs or ARBs either increases risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or is associated with worse COVID-19 disease outcomes, and to assess the efficacy of these medications for COVID-19 treatment. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (Ovid) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2003 to 4 May 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance for 1 year; the World Health Organization database of COVID-19 publications and medRxiv.org through 17 April 2020; and ClinicalTrials.gov to 24 April 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance. STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies and trials in adults that examined associations and effects of ACEIs or ARBs on risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease severity and mortality. DATA EXTRACTION: Single-reviewer abstraction confirmed by another reviewer, independent evaluation by 2 reviewers of study quality, and collective assessment of certainty of evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: Two retrospective cohort studies found that ACEI and ARB use was not associated with a higher likelihood of receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, and 1 case-control study found no association with COVID-19 illness in a large community (moderate-certainty evidence). Fourteen observational studies, involving a total of 23 565 adults with COVID-19, showed consistent evidence that neither medication was associated with more severe COVID-19 illness (high-certainty evidence). Four registered randomized trials plan to evaluate ACEIs and ARBs for treatment of COVID-19. LIMITATION: Half the studies were small and did not adjust for important confounding variables. CONCLUSION: High-certainty evidence suggests that ACEI or ARB use is not associated with more severe COVID-19 disease, and moderate-certainty evidence suggests no association between use of these medications and positive SARS-CoV-2 test results among symptomatic patients. Whether these medications increase the risk for mild or asymptomatic disease or are beneficial in COVID-19 treatment remains uncertain. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: None.

METHODS: This study adopted a retrospective data analysis. We investigated ACP services provided by 15 veterans hospitals in Taiwan from 2019 to June 2020. We also conducted a statistical analysis on the ACP services provided by the Taipei Veterans General Hospital. RESULTS: From 2019 to June 2020, 15 veterans hospitals in Taiwan provided ACP services to 2,493 individuals. The outpatient ACP services declined significantly after January 2020, decreasing from a national average of 206.2 ± 29.2 declarants per month to 106.2 ± 30.8 declarants per month in the 6 months immediately following the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak (p < 0.001). From the official implementation of the ACP in January 2019 to the end of June 2020, a total of 1,126 declarants accepted ACP services at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital. When the COVID-19 pandemic was prevalent, the declarants who received ACP services were younger (i.e., 60.1 ± 15.2 vs. 65.5 ± 16.3 years; p <0.001). After the variables had been adjusted, the changes in the characteristics of the declarants receiving ACP services when the COVID-19 pandemic was prevalent were as follows: a significant increase in the percentage of hospital staff receiving ACP services (OR: 5.460, 95% CI: 2.378-12.536); An increase in the percentage of declarants who paid for the ACP services received at their own expense (OR: 3.417, 95% CI: 1.591-7.339); and an increase in the percentage of declarants who received the consultations with 3 or more people (OR: 2.017, 95% CI: 1.278-3.182). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 severely changed outpatient ACP services provided by hospitals.

However, the plurality of advanced sequencing datasets—such as short and long reads—presents a formidable computational challenge to uniformly perform quantitative, variant or phylogenetic analysis, thus limiting its application in public health laboratories engaged in studying epidemic outbreaks. We present a computational tool, Infectious Pathogen Detector (IPD), to perform integrated analysis of diverse genomic datasets, with a customized analytical module for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The IPD pipeline quantitates individual occurrences of 1060 pathogens and performs mutation and phylogenetic analysis from heterogeneous sequencing datasets. Using IPD, we demonstrate a varying burden (5.055–999655.7 fragments per million) of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts across 1500 short- and long-read sequencing SARS-CoV-2 datasets and identify 4634 SARS-CoV-2 variants (~3.05 variants per sample), including 449 novel variants, across the genome with distinct hotspot mutations in the ORF1ab and S genes along with their phylogenetic relationships establishing the utility of IPD in tracing the genome isolates from the genomic data (as accessed on 11 June 2020). The IPD predicts the occurrence and dynamics of variability among infectious pathogens—with a potential for direct utility in the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond to help automate the sequencing-based pathogen analysis and in responding to public health threats, efficaciously.
