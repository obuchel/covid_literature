The purpose of this report is to describe the process of sustaining a clinical program in practice for over 4 years. We present a framework for integrating tools for sustainability with the Knowledge-to-Action model in the context of a proactive physical therapy (PAPT) program for individuals with early-stage Parkinson's disease. METHODS Sustainability of implementation strategies was addressed using the Dynamic Sustainability Framework and sustainability assessment tools. Repeated retrospective medical record reviews and phone interviews were used to evaluate the reach and adoption of the PAPT over 4 years. Characteristics of those who engaged with PAPT, implementation fidelity, and clinical effectiveness were assessed for year 1 and year 3. Sustainability was measured using RE-AIM, NHS Sustainability Model, and Clinical Sustainability Assessment Tool. RESULTS Reach increased from 28 to 110 total patients per year and spread occurred from one to three sites. PAPT user age, sex, Hoehn and Yahr rating, time since diagnosis, and type of insurance were similar in year 1 and year 3 (p > 0.05). The program sustained its effect to help participants increase or maintain self-reported exercise (Y1, 95%; Y3, 100%). However, upon evaluation PAPT users in year 3 had longer time since symptom onset and worse UPDRS motor scores compared to the PAPT users in year 1 (p < 0.05). All sites sustained the core intervention components, with sustainability scores of 71/100 (± 9.9) on the NHS Sustainability Model and 6.1/7 (± 0.9) on the Clinical Sustainability Assessment Tool. CONCLUSIONS Integrating multiple sustainability models and assessments supported continued effectiveness, spread, and sustainment of PAPT for 4 years. Effective planning, anticipating common healthcare changes, and addressing sustainability determinants early in program implementation were essential aspects of long-term success.","MacDonald, Jillian; Doyle, Laura; Moore, Jennifer L; Rafferty, Miriam R",Implementation science communications,853,17

However, many studies have reported the issue of loosening pedicle screws after spinal surgery, which is a serious concern. To address this problem, diverse types of pedicle screws have been examined to identify those with good fixation strength and osseointegration in spine bone. The porcine spine is a good alternative for the human spine in the evaluation of pedicle screws due to the anatomical size, mechanical characteristics, and cost. Although several studies have reported that pedicle screws are efficient in the porcine model, no study has described detailed protocols for the evaluation of a pedicle screw using the porcine model. Here, we describe a detailed method for evaluating transpedicular screws using an in vivo porcine lumbar spine model. The technical details for anesthesia, spine surgery, and harvest provided here will facilitate with the evaluation of the transpedicular screw fixation model.","Moon, Young Jae; Kim, Jong-Kil; Oh, Hong-Geun; Kang, Ji-Hun; Park, Gun-Joo; Lee, Kwang-Bok",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,853,16

METHODS A comparison was made among the number of first cellular pathological diagnoses of malignancy made from the 11th to the 20th week of the years 2018-2020. RESULTS Cancer diagnoses fell in 2020 by 39% compared with the average number recorded in 2018 and 2019. Prostate cancer (75%) bladder cancer (66%) and colorectal cancer (CRC; 62%) had the greatest decrease. CRC was identified as carrying a potentially important diagnostic delay. CONCLUSIONS For CRC corrective procedures (continuing mass screening tests; patient triage by family physicians; diagnostic procedures alternative to colonoscopy; predictive evaluation on biopsy samples) were advised.

To identify host factors essential for coronavirus infection, we performed genome-wide functional genetic screens with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human coronavirus 229E. These screens uncovered virus-specific as well as shared host factors, including TMEM41B and PI3K type 3. We discovered that SARS-CoV-2 requires the lysosomal protein TMEM106B to infect human cell lines and primary lung cells. TMEM106B overexpression enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as pseudovirus infection, suggesting a role in viral entry. Furthermore, single-cell RNA-sequencing of airway cells from patients with COVID-19 demonstrated that TMEM106B expression correlates with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present study uncovered a collection of coronavirus host factors that may be exploited to develop drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection or future zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks.","Baggen, Jim; Persoons, Leentje; Vanstreels, Els; Jansen, Sander; Van Looveren, Dominique; Boeckx, Bram; Geudens, Vincent; De Man, Julie; Jochmans, Dirk; Wauters, Joost; Wauters, Els; Vanaudenaerde, Bart M; Lambrechts, Diether; Neyts, Johan; Dallmeier, Kai; Thibaut, Hendrik Jan; Jacquemyn, Maarten; Maes, Piet; Daelemans, Dirk",Nature genetics,853,6

QC increased the antimicrobial activity against yeast exponentially with a pH-dependent increase in the cationic amphiphilic drug (CAD) structure. CAD-QC localized in the yeast membranes and induced glucose starvation by noncompetitively inhibiting glucose uptake as antipsychotic chlorpromazine (CPZ) did. An exponential increase in antimicrobial activity with pH-dependent CAD formation was also observed for CQ, indicating that the CAD structure is crucial for its pharmacological activity. A decrease in CAD structure with a slight decrease in pH from 7.4 greatly reduced their effects; namely, these drugs would inefficiently act on falciparum malaria and COVID-19 pneumonia patients with acidosis, resulting in resistance. The decrease in CAD structure at physiological pH was not observed for quinine, primaquine, or mefloquine. Therefore, restoring the normal blood pH or using pH-insensitive quinoline drugs might be effective for these infectious diseases with acidosis.","Kitagawa, Tomohisa; Matsumoto, Atsushi; Terashima, Ichiro; Uesono, Yukifumi",Journal of medicinal chemistry,853,16

Specific antagonism of TLR9 is of great clinical interest to reduce tissue damage in a wide range of pathologies, and has been approached by modification of nucleic acids, the recognized ligand for TLR9. Such oligonucleotide-derived pharmacotherapeutics have limitations in specificity for nucleic acid receptors, significant potential for immunologic recognition with generation of innate and adaptive immune responses, and limited bioavailability. We have identified enantiomeric analogues of traditional (-)-morphinans as having TLR9 antagonist properties on reporter cell lines. One of these analogues (COV08-0064) is demonstrated to be a novel small-molecule antagonist of TLR9 with greater specificity for TLR9 than oligo-based antagonists. COV08-0064 has wide bioavailability, including the s.c. and oral routes. It specifically inhibits the action of TLR9 antagonists on reporter cells lines and the production of cytokines by TLR9 agonists from primary cells. It also has efficacy in limiting TLR9-mediated sterile inflammation in in vivo models of acute liver injury and acute pancreatitis. The identification of a morphinan-based novel small-molecule structure with TLR9 antagonism is a significant step in expanding therapeutic strategies in the field of sterile inflammatory injury.","Hoque, Rafaz; Farooq, Ahmad; Malik, Ahsan; Trawick, Bobby N; Berberich, David W; McClurg, Joseph P; Galen, Karen P; Mehal, Wajahat",Journal of immunology,853,12

DESIGN Sphincter-saving mesorectal excision in 4 human cases via a single laparoscopic port. SETTINGS A university hospital and a private hospital. PATIENTS A series of 4 patients who underwent single-port laparoscopic sphincter-saving rectal resection for rectal cancer. Two of them were total and 2 were partial mesorectal excisions. INTERVENTIONS An umbilical incision was made to place the multichannel single port. The sigmoid colon was hung to the left lateral abdominal wall using an intracorporeal stitch passing through its appendices epiploicae to achieve medial dissection and vascular ligation. The mesorectum was sharply dissected down to the pelvic floor. Endoscopic linear roticulating staplers were used to divide the rectum and proximal colon. A specimen was retrieved using an extraction bag through the umbilicus. Anastomosis was performed using a circular stapler, or pull-through hand-sewn anastomosis was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Duration of the operation, length of hospital stay, surgical complications, wound size, and histopathologic data. RESULTS There were no perioperative or postoperative complications. Mean operative time was 347 minutes (range, 240-480 minutes). Mean hospital stay was 4.25 days (range, 4-5 days). Mean wound size was 3.5 cm (range, 3-4 cm). Mean number of harvested lymph nodes was 15 (range, 8-28). CONCLUSIONS With the help of sophisticated surgical technology and techniques, single-port laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer will be feasible while also maintaining oncologic principles and patient safety.","Hamzaoglu, Ismail; Karahasanoglu, Tayfun; Baca, Bilgi; Karatas, Adem; Aytac, Erman; Kahya, Arif Sami",Archives of surgery,853,0

We investigated the feasibility, acceptability and performance of optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging based diagnosis of uveitis. METHODS Observational cross-sectional study involving children with and without uveitis. Children underwent routine clinical examination and acquisition of anterior segment (AS) OCT scans images of intraocular inflammatory cells. Acceptability of image acquisition was assessed using a visual analogue scale, and duration of image acquisition. Inter and intra-observer variability of manual counting of acquired images (Bland-Altman limits of agreement), correlation between imaging and routine assessment, and sensitivity and specificity of AS-OCT detection of active inflammation were assessed. RESULTS Of 26 children aged 3yrs to 15yrs (median 8yrs) who underwent imaging, 12 had active inflammation. All patients rated acceptability of image acquisition as at least 8·5/10. Time taken to acquire images ranged from 1·5mins to 22mins (median 8mins). There was good positive correlation between clinical assessment and image based cell quantification (R2 =0·63, p=0·002). Sensitivity of AS-OCT manual image cell count for diagnosis of active inflammation was 92% (95% Confidence interval 62%-99%), specificity 86% (58%-98%), and negative predictive value ('ruling-out' uveitis) 92% (65%-99%). CONCLUSION Non-contact, high-resolution imaging for JIA uveitis surveillance is feasible, acceptable to patients, and holds the promise of transforming paediatric practice. Further work is needed to determine the analytic and clinical validity of AS-OCT quantification of active inflammation, and the clinical and cost-effectiveness of imaging based disease monitoring.","Akbarali, Saira; Rahi, Jugnoo S; Dick, Andrew D; Parkash, Kiren; Etherton, Katie; Edelsten, Clive; Liu, Xiaoxuan; Solebo, Ameenat L",Arthritis & rheumatology,853,0

Unfortunately, Chinese nurses currently do not have a valid short-form instrument for determining family resilience. This study aimed to translate the Revised Walsh Family Resilience Questionnaire (WFRQ-R) into Chinese and determine its reliability and validity among stroke survivors and stroke family caregivers. METHODS We translated the WFRQ-R into Chinese according to Brislin's translation guidelines, and conducted a questionnaire survey among stroke survivors and stroke family caregivers., in Jinzhou City, People's Republic of China. We conducted two rounds of the questionnaires. First, we conducted 400 questionnaires, including 394 effective questionnaires for item analysis and exploratory factor analysis. Secondly, we conducted 350 questionnaires, including 322 effective questionnaires for reliability analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. RESULTS The instrument was found to have a Cronbach's α value of 0.83 and acceptable composite reliability coefficients. Moreover, content validity was determined to be good, and the three-factor model obtained during exploratory factor analysis (explaining 60.67% of the variance) and modified during confirmatory factor analysis (χ2/degrees of freedom =1.41; root mean square error of approximation =0.04; goodness-of-fit index =0.91) suggested an acceptable construct validity.

Recent interest and widespread implementation of LESS stems from advancements in commercially available access port technology. Consequently, this study objectively compared the technical performance between conventional laparoscopic and LESS surgical ports in a modified Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) simulator. METHODS The 24 novice participants in this study performed the FLS peg transfer task using two conventional laparoscopic 12-mm working ports, the SILS port, the TriPort access system, and the GelPOINT system with two standard length 5-mm graspers. Each participant completed the task using conventional laparoscopy first for familiarization, followed by each of the three LESS surgical ports in random order. Task completion time, errors, and subjective questionnaire ratings were used to compare conventional laparoscopy and the single-port devices. Congruent with FLS scoring procedures, task completion time and errors were used to compute a standardized task score for each port. RESULTS The task score did not differ significantly between conventional laparoscopy and the single-port devices. Additionally, there were no task score differences between trials for either the SILS port or the GelPOINT system. There was a significant performance decrement starting with the TriPort versus starting with either the SILS port or the GelPOINT, which resulted in the lowest overall trial task score (p<0.05). Task completion difficulty and instrument maneuverability resulted in no significant differences between ports. Ease of use and overall rank were significant, with conventional laparoscopy rated as the easiest to use and the highest overall followed by the GelPOINT system. CONCLUSIONS Overall, the TriPort may be more challenging for novices to use in learning the LESS procedure than either the SILS port or the GelPOINT system. The GelPOINT system may offer the most consistent platform for LESS performance and novice skill acquisition.","Brown-Clerk, Bernadette; de Laveaga, Adam E; LaGrange, Chad A; Wirth, Laura M; Lowndes, Bethany R; Hallbeck, M Susan",Surgical endoscopy,853,1

Nevertheless, it poses a challenge and many people with TB remain use only smear microscopy for diagnosis. In an environment where transmission is becoming easier by the day the challenge becomes burdensome once disease gets associated with drug resistance, HIV, other diseases, etc. It becomes of paramount importance to address this biggest public health challenge delivering timely diagnosis using advanced technologies. Initial microscopic examination forms the backbone of TB diagnosis since 100 years along with clinical confirmations. Newer advanced diagnostic tools coming into play are genotypic assays (LPA, CBNAAT, LAMP) that are rapid molecular tests, and culture methods (liquid culture media) with standard drug susceptibility testing assays. Program ideates to correlate these rapid molecular diagnostics with turn-around time (TAT) as low as around 2 hours, with conventional standard methods. These help in reinforcing the diagnostic capacities and also provide identification of drug resistance patterns for few most important first line and second line drugs.

Such disease patterns make pertussis recognition difficult and lead to delays in treatment. Ongoing research using newer tools for molecular analysis holds promise for improved understanding of pertussis epidemiology, bacterial pathogenesis, bioinformatics, and immunology. Together, these advances provide a foundation for the development of new-generation diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.","Kilgore, Paul E; Salim, Abdulbaset M; Zervos, Marcus J; Schmitt, Heinz-Josef",Clinical microbiology reviews,853,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty male piglets were the study subjects; normocapnic hypoxia was induced in 40 piglets and ten were sham-operated (controls). When bradycardia and/or severe hypotension occurred, reoxygenation was initiated. Animals were allocated in 4 groups according to the oxygen concentration, they were resuscitated with 18%, 21%, 40%, and 100% O2. Persisting asystole despite 10 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and return of spontaneous circulation were the endpoints of the experiment. Surviving animals were euthanized and brain cortex samples were collected, hematoxylin and eosin-stained, and examined for apoptotic bodies observing 10 consecutive high power fields. RESULTS Histological examination of the control group did not show any pathological change. On the contrary, apoptosis of neurons was found in 87.5% of treated animals. When specimens were examined according to the oxygen concentration used for resuscitation, we found marked intergroup variability; a higher percentage of apoptotic neurons was observed in piglets of group 4 (100% oxygen) compared to the others (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS This preliminary data shows that normocapnic hypoxia and reoxygenation in Landrace/Large White piglets resulted in significant histological changes in the brain cortex. The degree of pathological changes in cortical neurons was significantly associated with the oxygen concentration used for reoxygenation, with a higher percentage of apoptotic neurons being observed in piglets reoxygenated with 100% compared to 18% O2 and to 21% O2.","Faa, G; Fanos, V; Fanni, D; Gerosa, C; Faa, A; Fraschini, M; Pais, M E; Di Felice, E; Papalois, A; Varsami, M; Xanthos, T; Iacovidou, N",BioMed research international,853,1

Tubes with cuffs made of polyurethane rather than polyvinyl chloride or with a conical rather than a cylindrical shape increase tracheal sealing. OBJECTIVES To test whether using polyurethane and/or conical cuffs reduces tracheal colonization and VAP in patients with acute respiratory failure. METHODS We conducted a multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized study in four parallel groups in four intensive care units between 2010 and 2012. A cohort of 621 patients with expected ventilation longer than 2 days was included at intubation with a cuff composed of cylindrical polyvinyl chloride (n = 148), cylindrical polyurethane (n = 143), conical polyvinyl chloride (n = 150), or conical polyurethane (n = 162). We used Kaplan-Meier estimates and log-rank tests to compare times to events. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS After excluding 17 patients who secondarily refused participation or had met an exclusion criterion, 604 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Cumulative tracheal colonization greater than 10(3) cfu/ml at Day 2 was as follows (median [interquartile range]): cylindrical polyvinyl chloride, 0.66 (0.58-0.74); cylindrical polyurethane, 0.61 (0.53-0.70); conical polyvinyl chloride, 0.67 (0.60-0.76); and conical polyurethane, 0.62 (0.55-0.70) (P = 0.55). VAP developed in 77 patients (14.4%), and postextubational stridor developed in 28 patients (6.4%) (P = 0.20 and 0.28 between groups, respectively).

Colonoscopy is regarded as the gold standard examination for detecting and eradicating neoplastic lesion. However, there are some uncertainties in colonoscopy practice that are related to limitations in human performance. First, approximately one-fourth of colorectal neoplasms are missed on a single colonoscopy. Second, it is still difficult for non-experts to perform adequately regarding optical biopsy. Third, recording of some quality indicators (e.g. cecal intubation, bowel preparation, and withdrawal speed) which are related to adenoma detection rate, is sometimes incomplete. With recent improvements in machine learning techniques and advances in computer performance, artificial intelligence-assisted computer-aided diagnosis is being increasingly utilized by endoscopists. In particular, the emergence of deep-learning, data-driven machine learning techniques have made the development of computer-aided systems easier than that of conventional machine learning techniques, the former currently being considered the standard artificial intelligence engine of computer-aided diagnosis by colonoscopy. To date, computer-aided detection systems seem to have improved the rate of detection of neoplasms. Additionally, computer-aided characterization systems may have the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy in real-time clinical practice. Furthermore, some artificial intelligence-assisted systems that aim to improve the quality of colonoscopy have been reported. The implementation of computer-aided system clinical practice may provide additional benefits such as helping in educational poorly performing endoscopists and supporting real-time clinical decision making.

Effect of trocar insertion and position on MN are examined in the present study. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten millimeter incision was made at the center of the lower lip oral vestibule. Two 5 mm lateral incisions of the lower lip oral vestibule were made at the junction between the incisor and the canine. These 2 lateral incisions were high, just below the edge of lower lip. Nine pigs (18 MN) were randomly divided into 3 groups and MN dissection was performed. The angle between the lateral ports and median line were changed between 15 and 45 degrees among 3 groups and effect on MN was examined. RESULTS During dissection when insertion and other ports are in neutral position visual inspection of MNs did not reveal any compression bilaterally. The distance between MN and the ports was 18.2±2.1 mm (16.3 to 21.2 mm). In group I and group II, MNs have no compression by the lateral trocars. In group III (45 degrees), left MNs were all compressed. Two MNs (66.7%) were compressed on the right side. The MN was compressed at its ramification. CONCLUSIONS The results of the present experimental study, endorse the suggested medial and lateral vestibular incisions for transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy vestibular approach. However, during dynamic modification of the lateral port position/angle, MN compression was observed when the angle was >45 degrees.","Zhang, Daqi; Li, Shijie; Dionigi, Gianlorenzo; Wang, Tie; Zhang, Jiao; Xue, Gaofeng; Sun, Hui","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",853,1

Patients prefer a simultaneous bilateral procedure instead of 2 separate unilateral procedures. There is currently little evidence comparing bilateral and unilateral varicose vein surgeries. OBJECTIVE To report the clinical outcomes of unilateral and bilateral radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for varicose veins. MATERIALS AND METHODS The authors retrospectively collected data on clinical outcomes of patients who underwent RFA. They investigated clinical, etiologic, anatomic, and pathophysiologic (CEAP) score, venous clinical severity score (VCSS), and quality of life (QoL) score. RESULTS Radiofrequency ablation was performed in 546 limbs in 385 patients. Women comprised 60.4% of the patients. The mean age was 52.3 ± 11.6 years (range, 19-84). The occlusion rate after 2 years was 94.5%. Clinical outcomes of CEAP score, VCSS, and QoL scores improved significantly from 2.15 ± 0.45, 2.70 ± 2.04, and 6.91 ± 6.69 at baseline to 2.10 ± 0.32, 0.63 ± 0.04, and 3.38 ± 4.74 at the study end, respectively.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients with metastatic non-resectable colorectal cancer treated with a combination of an antibody and a chemotherapeutic drug, were included. Computed tomography (CT) scans (thorax, abdomen and pelvis) were performed at baseline and after every fourth treatment cycle. RECIST was intended for response evaluation. The scans were consecutively read by a heterogeneous group of radiologists as a part of daily work and hereafter retrospectively reviewed by a dedicated experienced radiologist. Agreement on best overall response (BOR) between readers and reviewer was quantified using κ-coefficients and the discrepancy rate was correlated with the number of different readers per patient using a χ(2)-test. RESULTS One hundred patients with 396 CT scans were included. Discrepancies between the readers and the reviewer were found in 47 patients. The majority of discrepancies concerned the application of RECIST. With the review, BOR changed in 17 patients, although, only in six patients the change was potentially treatment altering. Overall, the κ-coefficient of agreement between readers and reviewer was 0.71 (good). However, in the subgroup of responding patients the κ-coefficient was 0.21 (fair). The number of patients with discrepancies was significantly higher with three or more different readers per patient than with less (p =0.0003). CONCLUSION RECIST was not consistently applied and the majority of the reader discrepancies were RECIST related. Post review, 17 patients changed BOR; six patients in a potentially treatment altering manner. Additionally, we found that the part of patients with discrepancies increased significantly with more than three different readers per patient. The findings support a peer-review approach where a few dedicated radiologists perform double blinded readings of all the on-going cancer trial patients' CT scans.","Skougaard, Kristin; McCullagh, Mark James Dusgaard; Nielsen, Dorte; Hendel, Helle Westergren; Jensen, Benny Vittrup; Johannesen, Helle Hjorth",Acta oncologica,853,5

OATP3A1 is widely expressed in the human body and its presence in tissue-blood barriers, neurons and muscle cells marks it as a potential pharmacological target. Herein we demonstrate that an otherwise membrane impermeant, zwitterionic fluorescent coumarin probe, bearing a sulfonate function is a potent substrate of human OATP3A1, thus readily transported into HEK-293-OATP3A1 cells allowing functional investigation and the screen of drug interactions of the OATP3A1 transporter. At the same time, dyes lacking either the sulfonate motif or the coumarin scaffold showed a dramatic decrease in affinity or even a complete loss of transport. Furthermore, we observed a distinct inhibition/activation pattern in the OATP3A1-mediated uptake of closely related fluorescent coumarin derivatives differing only in the presence of the sulfonate moiety. Additionally, we detected a synergistic effect between one of the probes tested and the endogenous OATP substrate estrone-3-sulfate. These data, together with docking results indicate the presence of at least two cooperative substrate binding sites in OATP3A1. Besides providing the first sensitive probe for testing OATP3A1 substrate/inhibitor interactions, our results also help to understand substrate recognition and transport mechanism of the poorly characterized OATP3A1. Moreover, coumarins are good candidates for OATP3A1-targeted drug delivery and as pharmacological modulators of OATP3A1.","Bakos, Éva; Tusnády, Gábor E; Német, Orsolya; Patik, Izabel; Magyar, Csaba; Németh, Krisztina; Kele, Péter; Özvegy-Laczka, Csilla",Biochemical pharmacology,853,4

These differences have attracted considerable attention, with studies highlighting several potential causes, including male biased mutation and reproductive variance, historical changes in population size, and selection at linked loci. We revisit this question in light of our new theory about the effects of life history and given pedigree-based estimates of the dependence of human mutation rates on sex and age. We demonstrate that life history effects, particularly higher generation times in males than females, likely had multiple effects on human X-to-autosomes (X:A) polymorphism ratios, through the extent of male mutation bias, the equilibrium X:A ratios of effective population sizes, and differential responses to changes in population size. We also show that the standard approach of using divergence between species to correct for the male bias in mutation results in biased estimates of X:A effective population size ratios. We obtain alternative estimates using pedigree-based estimates of the male mutation bias, which reveal X:A ratios of effective population sizes to be considerably greater than previously appreciated. We then show that the joint effects of historical changes in life history and population size can explain X:A polymorphism ratios in extant human populations. Our results suggest that ancestral human populations were highly polygynous; that non-African populations experienced a substantial reduction in polygyny and/or increase in male-biased generation times around the out of Africa bottleneck; and that extant diversity levels were affected by fairly recent changes in sex-specific life history. Significance Statement All else being equal, the ratio of diversity levels on X and autosomes at selectively neutral sites should mirror the ratio of their numbers in the population and thus equal ¾. In reality, the ratios observed across human populations differ markedly from ¾ and from each other. Because from a population perspective, autosomes spend an equal number of generations in both sexes while the X spends twice as many generations in females, these departures from the naïve expectations likely reflect differences between male and female life histories and their effects on mutation processes. Indeed, we show that the ratios observed across human populations can be explained by demographic history, assuming plausible, sex-specific mutation rates, generation times and reproductive variances.","Amster, Guy; Murphy, David A.; Milligan, William M.; Sella, Guy",bioRxiv,853,30

Sarawak, the largest state in Malaysia has consistently recorded the highest cervical cancer rate in the country where nearly half of its population still live in the rural areas and is at increased risk of the disease due to inequitable access to healthcare. The countrywide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic had halted the accessibility to cervical cancer screening programme. The aim of the study is to determine the feasibility of providing primary HPV DNA test using the selfsampling method to the hard-to-reach population in the interior of Sarawak during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a cross-sectional study where women aged between 20-80 years were recruited via convenient sampling from villages in Long Banga, Sarawak over a five-day outreach programme. Cervicovaginal selfsamples were obtained and screened for the presence of high-risk human papillomavirus DNA (HR-HPV) using the careHPVTM Test. A self-administered questionnaire was also administered to determine the sociodemographic and perception towards the self-sampling method. RESULTS The 55 women recruited consist of ethnic backgrounds of Penan (58.18%), Kenyah (25.45%), Iban (5.45%), Saban (3.64%), Kelabit (3.64%), Malay (1.82%) and Chinese (1.82%). The prevalence of HR-HPV was 1.85% (n=1/55). Nearly 80% of the women were unemployed, and more than half have had attended primary education. Nine (16.4%) have heard about HPV, and seven (13%) knew HPV infection could cause cervical cancer. Three of them had HPV vaccination, and only one (1.85%) knew the brand of the HPV vaccine. Although 40% preferred self-sampling over clinician-collection, only ten (18.2%) women have completed the self-collection perception questionnaire. CONCLUSION Primary HPV DNA screening using the selfsampling method can be carried out in the remote areas during the COVID-19 pandemic without compromising mobility restriction.","Tan, C S; Hamzah, N D; Ismail, Z H F; Jerip, A R; Kipli, M",The Medical journal of Malaysia,853,6

Although literature remained sparse, reports indicated that food insecurity is disproportionately high among African, Caribbean, and Black (ACB) population since the outset of COVID-19. Hence, we assessed the food insecurity conditions of ACB populations globally during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Comprehensive searches in CINAHL, Medline (Ovid), PubMed (Medline), Food Science and Technology Abstracts, SCOPUS, EMBASE, AMED, CAB Abstracts, Cochrane Library (OVID), and PsycINFO were carried out. Title/abstract and full-text screening, quality appraisal (modified JBI QARI), and data extraction were carried out by double reviewers. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 354 articles. After removal of duplicates and irrelevant articles, a full-text review and critical appraisal, 9 papers were included in the study. After data extraction and synthesis, six major themes emerged from the analysis: increased food insecurity, adverse health outcomes of food insecurity, exacerbation of existing disparities, systemic inequities and adverse policies, racism, and sociocultural response and solutions. CONCLUSION/IMPLICATIONS: The study showed that COVID-19 had exacerbated food insecurity and other health disparities within racialized populations including ACB people, due to systemic anti-Black racism; inadequate representation in decision-making; and issues of cultural appropriateness and competency of health services. While sociocultural response by ACB people through the expansion of their social capital is imperative, specific policies easing access to food, medicine, and shelter for racialized communities will ensure equity while reducing global food insecurity and health crises during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Dabone, Charles; Mbagwu, Ikenna; Muray, Mwali; Ubangha, Lovelyn; Kohoun, Bagnini; Etowa, Egbe; Nare, Hilary; Kiros, Getachew; Etowa, Josephine",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),853,24

To examine the association between the use and timing of IFN-&#945;2b and clinical outcomes, we analyzed in a retrospective multicenter cohort study of 446 COVID-19 patients in Hubei, China. Regression models estimated that early administration (&#8804;5 days after admission) of IFN-&#945;2b was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality in comparison with no admission of IFN-&#945;2b, whereas late administration of IFN-&#945;2b was associated with increased mortality. Among survivors, early IFN-&#945;2b was not associated with hospital discharge or computed tomography (CT) scan improvement, whereas late IFN-&#945;2b was associated with delayed recovery. Additionally, early IFN-&#945;2b and umifenovir alone or together were associated with reduced mortality and accelerated recovery in comparison with treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) alone.

Here, we collected measures on perceived stress, resilience, and behavioral coping strategies, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in a cross-sectional sample of 141 community dwelling older adults (mean age = 74.4 ± 8.4, 59% females) who were part of two longitudinal observational studies in Massachusetts, U.S. Our results indicate that participants demonstrated moderate levels of stress related to COVID-19 and showed relatively high levels of resilience. Higher resilience was associated with greater use of adaptive coping behaviors and less use of maladaptive coping behaviors. The use of maladaptive coping strategies was associated with more stress. Moreover, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that resilience was the strongest unique predictor of stress, thus, largely accounting for the observed coping-outcome associations. Individual differences in resilience levels moderated the effects of two coping strategies (planning and self-blame) on stress. Specifically, planning was associated with increased levels of stress for people with low resilience. In contrast, high personal resilience attenuated the negative effect of self-blame on their stress levels. Taken together, our findings suggest that resilience is critical for coping with stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future approaches for augmenting resilience could prove to be important potential interventions to help support older adults navigating stressful situations as well as lessen adverse effects on neurocognitive and mental health in the future.","Vannini, Patrizia; Gagliardi, Geoffroy P; Kuppe, Madeline; Dossett, Michelle L; Donovan, Nancy J; Gatchel, Jennifer R; Quiroz, Yakeel T; Premnath, Pranitha Y; Amariglio, Rebecca; Sperling, Reisa A; Marshall, Gad A",J Psychiatr Res,853,6

METHODS: Peptide/siRNA complexes were prepared with two new derivatives of the CPP S413-PV, which combine a lauroyl group attached to the N- or C-terminus with a histidine-enrichment in the N-terminus of the S413-PV peptide, being named C12-H5-S413-PV and H5-S413-PV-C12, respectively. Physicochemical characterization of siRNA complexes was performed and their cytotoxicity and efficiency to mediate siRNA delivery and gene silencing in cancer cells were assessed in the absence and presence of serum. RESULTS: Peptide/siRNA complexes prepared with the C12-H5-S413-PV derivative showed a nanoscale (ca. 100 nm) particle size, as revealed by TEM, and efficiently mediated gene silencing (37%) in human U87 glioblastoma cells in the presence of 30% serum. In addition, the new C12-H5-S413-PV-based siRNA delivery system efficiently downregulated stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1, a key-enzyme of lipid metabolism overexpressed in cancer, which resulted in a significant decrease in the viability of U87 cells. Importantly, these complexes were able to spare healthy human astrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: These encouraging results pave the way for a potential application of the C12-H5-S413-PV peptide as a promising tool in cancer gene therapy.","Morais, Catarina M; Cardoso, Ana M; Aguiar, Luísa; Vale, Nuno; Nóbrega, Clévio; Zuzarte, Mónica; Gomes, Paula; Pedroso de Lima, Maria C; Jurado, Amália S",Pharm Res,853,21

Research over the past decade has added further to our understanding of the role of prenatal infection in schizophrenia risk. These investigations include several well-powered designs, and like some earlier studies, measured maternal antibodies to specific infectious agents in stored serum samples and large registers to identify clinically diagnosed infections during pregnancy. Convergent findings from antibody studies suggest that prenatal maternal infection with Toxoplasma gondii is associated with increased schizophrenia risk in the offspring, while associations with HSV-2 infection are likely attributable to confounding. Maternal influenza infection remains a viable candidate for schizophrenia, based on an early serological study, though there has been only one attempt to replicate this finding, with a differing methodology. A prior association between maternal serologically confirmed cytomegalovirus infections require further study. Clinically diagnosed maternal infection, particularly bacterial infection, also appears to be associated with increased risk of offspring schizophrenia, and heterogeneity in these findings is likely due to methodological differences between studies. Further clarification may be provided by future studies that address the timing, type, and clinical features of infections. Important insight may be gained by examining the long-term offspring outcomes in emerging epidemics such as Zika virus and COVID-19, and by investigating the interaction between exposure to prenatal infection and other risk or protective factors.","Cheslack-Postava, Keely; Brown, Alan S",Schizophr. res,853,21

Hypertension, diabetes, and obesity are under discussion as important factors affecting the severity of disease. Air pollution has been considered to play a role in the diffusion of the virus, in the propagation of the contagion, in the severity of symptoms, and in the poor prognosis. Accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis that environmental particulate matter (PM) can trigger inflammatory responses at molecular, cellular, and organ levels, sustaining respiratory, cardiovascular, and dysmetabolic diseases.To better understand the intricate relationships among pre-existing conditions, PM, and viral infection, we examined the response at the molecular level of T47D human breast adenocarcinoma cells exposed to different fractions of PM. T47D cells express several receptors, including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and ACE2, the main - but not the only - receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry.PM samples were collected in an urban background site located in the Northern area of the City of Bologna (Emilia-Romagna Region, Northern Italy) during winter 2013. T47D cells were exposed to organic or aqueous (inorganic) extracts at the final concentration of 8 m3 for a 4-hour duration. Both the concentration and the exposure time were chosen to resemble an average outdoor exposure. RNA was extracted from cells, purified and hybridised on 66k microarray slides from Agilent.The lists of differentially expressed genes in PM organic extracts were evaluated by using Metacore, and an enrichment analysis was performed to identify pathways maps, process networks, and disease by biomarkers altered after T47D treatment.The analysis of the modulated genes gave evidence for the involvement of PM in dysmetabolic diseases, including diabetes and obesity, and hypertension through the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) canonical pathway.On the basis of current knowledge, existing data, and exploratory experimental evidence, we tease out the likely molecular interplay that can ultimately tip the disease outcome into severity. Looking beyond ACE2, several additional key markers are identified. Disruption of these targets worsens pre-existing conditions and/or exacerbates the adverse effects induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whilst appropriately designed, epidemiological studies are very much needed to investigate these associations based on our hypothesis of investigation, by reviewing recent experimental and epidemiological evidence, here we speculate and provide new insights on the possible role of environmental pollution in the exacerbation of effects by SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses.

The Dutch fight against the water would have stimulated perseverance, ingenuity, cooperation and an egalitarian and democratic society. Despite the long water management history of the Netherlands, water became an important part of the self-images of the nation only in the eighteenth Century. In the 1780s the idea that the Dutch had wrung their country from the sea became popular. Initially, this idea was especially popular among the (proto-)liberal opposition, who emphasised the importance of the nation and its achievements. By the end of the nineteenth Century, water had become a national symbol for orthodox Calvinists, Roman Catholics and Socialists too, despite their different views on the nation. Whenever there was fast social change, political turmoil or external threats, as in the late eighteenth Century, the 1930s and 1940s and since the 1990s, the link between water and the Netherlands was used to promote national pride and unity and stimulate action.

Methods: In a relevant renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patient derived xenograft (PDX) model, we use zirconium-89 (89Zr)-labeled anti-RTKs antibodies (immunoPET) onartuzumab, panitumumab, and trastuzumab to monitor MET, EGFR, and HER2 protein levels, respectively, during treatment with agents to which the model was resistant (cetuximab) or sensitive (INC280 and trametinib). Results: Cetuximab treatment resulted in continued tumor growth, as well as an increase in all RTK protein levels at the tumor in vivo on immunoPET, and ex vivo at the cellular level.

Here, we performed a combined in-silico and cell culture comparison of SARS-CoV-2 and the closely related SARS-CoV. RESULTS: Many amino acid positions are differentially conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which reflects the discrepancies in virus behaviour, i.e. more effective human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and higher mortality associated with SARS-CoV. Variations in the S protein (mediates virus entry) were associated with differences in its interaction with ACE2 (cellular S receptor) and sensitivity to TMPRSS2 (enables virus entry via S cleavage) inhibition. Anti-ACE2 antibodies more strongly inhibited SARS-CoV than SARS-CoV-2 infection, probably due to a stronger SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2 affinity relative to SARS-CoV S. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV displayed differences in cell tropism. Cellular ACE2 and TMPRSS2 levels did not indicate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. In conclusion, we identified genomic variation between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV that may reflect the differences in their clinical and biological behaviour.

Commonly associated with high fevers, gastrointestinal symptoms, and hyponatremia, it can be easily overlooked, especially during the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Legionella has specific antibiotic treatment that will improve outcome;thus, its recognition is important. Case Report: We present a case of Legionella pneumonia in a man presenting with shortness of breath and fever. The patient’s initial chest radiography was negative. With the use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) the changes of atypical pneumonia could be seen. Ultimately Legionella was confirmed with urine antigen testing, and appropriate antibiotic treatment was started. Discussion: Given the increased awareness of COVID-19 it is important to consider a broad differential with respiratory illness. Legionella pneumonia on POCUS is consistent with atypical pneumonia descriptions on ultrasound. Point-of-care ultrasound can be used to diagnose atypical pneumonia, specifically caused by Legionella in our case. Conclusion:Legionella is evident on POCUS but is difficult to distinguish from other infections with POCUS alone. One should consider Legionella if POCUS is positive for signs of atypical infection.","Lopez, Robert W.; Hysell, Matthew K.; Long, Jereme P.; Longobardi, Joseph",Clinical Practice and Cases in Emergency Medicine,853,2

In the first place we fit a global SIR model, with time delay, and constant parameters throughout the outbreak, including the contagion rate. The contention measures are reflected on an effective reduced susceptible population $N_{eff}$. In the second approach we consider a time-dependent contagion rate that reflects the contention measures either through a step by step fitting process or by following an exponential decay. In this last model the population is considered the one of the country $N$. In the linear region of the differential equations, when the total population $N$ is large the predictions are independent of $N$. We apply these methodologies to study the spread of the pandemic in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and South Africa for which the infection peaks are yet to be reached. In all of these cases we provide estimates for the reproduction and recovery rates. The scenario for a time varying contagion rate is optimistic, considering that reasonable measures are taken such that the reproduction factor $R_0$ decreases exponentially. The measured values for the recovery rate $\gamma$ are reported finding a universality of this parameter over various countries. We discuss the correspondence between the global SIR with effective population $N_{eff}$ and the evolution of the time local SIR.","Bizet, Nana Geraldine Cabo; Pena, Dami'an Kaloni Mayorga",,853,20

We aimed to investigate the indirect effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on general practice health-care usage, and the subsequent diagnoses of common physical and mental health conditions in a deprived UK population. METHODS: We did a retrospective cohort study using routinely collected primary care data that was recorded in the Salford Integrated Record between Jan 1, 2010, and May 31, 2020. We extracted the weekly number of clinical codes entered into patient records overall, and for six high-level categories: symptoms and observations, diagnoses, prescriptions, operations and procedures, laboratory tests, and other diagnostic procedures. Negative binomial regression models were applied to monthly counts of first diagnoses of common conditions (common mental health problems, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer), and corresponding first prescriptions of medications indicative of these conditions. We used these models to predict the expected numbers of first diagnoses and first prescriptions between March 1 and May 31, 2020, which were then compared with the observed numbers for the same time period. FINDINGS: Between March 1 and May 31, 2020, 1073 first diagnoses of common mental health problems were reported compared with 2147 expected cases (95% CI 1821 to 2489) based on preceding years, representing a 50·0% reduction (95% CI 41·1 to 56·9). Compared with expected numbers, 456 fewer diagnoses of circulatory system diseases (43·3% reduction, 95% CI 29·6 to 53·5), and 135 fewer type 2 diabetes diagnoses (49·0% reduction, 23·8 to 63·1) were observed. The number of first prescriptions of associated medications was also lower than expected for the same time period. However, the gap between observed and expected cancer diagnoses (31 fewer; 16·0% reduction, -18·1 to 36·6) during this time period was not statistically significant. INTERPRETATION: In this deprived urban population, diagnoses of common conditions decreased substantially between March and May 2020, suggesting a large number of patients have undiagnosed conditions. A rebound in future workload could be imminent as COVID-19 restrictions ease and patients with undiagnosed conditions or delayed diagnosis present to primary and secondary health-care services. Such services should prioritise the diagnosis and treatment of these patients to mitigate potential indirect harms to protect public health.

Material and Method: Sociodemographic and Clinical Data Form, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Trait Hope Scale (THS), Multi-Dimensional Perceived Social Support Scale (MDPSSS), Coping with Stress Scale (CSS) were applied to 170 healthcare professionals working in the pandemic hospital and meeting the study criteria. Results: The THS score was found to be the lowest in those working in both the service and emergency service/polyclinic, and a statistically significant dif-ference was found between this group and those working in the service and those working in the emergency/outpatient clinic (p &lt;0.001). The MDPSSS score of the group working in both departments was the lowest and this decrease was statistically significant (p=0.002). THS scores of the doctors were lower than nurses, and this lowness was statistically significant (p=0.001). A positive significant correlation was found between the total score of THS and CSS and MDPSSS scores (r=0.226, p=0.003) (r=0.194, p=0.023). Discussion: Perceived social support and hope levels decrease as the number of working units of health personnel increases during the Covid-19 pandemic process. Levels of hope differ according to the professions. The level of hope is positively associated with the coping ability and perceived multi-dimensional social support. This study has revealed that functional coping attitudes and perceived social support in healthcare professionals during pandemic periods are associated with high levels of hope.","Kazgan, A.; Yıldız, S.; Kurt, O.",Annals of Clinical and Analytical Medicine,853,20

We performed a retrospective cardiopathological analysis of the heart and vasculature from 23 autopsies of COVID-19 patients, comparing the findings with control tissue. Myocardium from autopsies of COVID-19 patients was categorised into severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive (n = 14) or negative (n = 9) based on the presence of viral RNA as determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Control tissue was selected from autopsies without COVID-19 (n = 10) with similar clinical sequelae. Histological characteristics were scored by ordinal and/or categorical grading. Five RT-PCR-positive cases underwent in situ hybridisation (ISH) for SARS-CoV-2. Patients with lethal COVID-19 infection were mostly male (78%) and had a high incidence of hypertension (91%), coronary artery disease (61%), and diabetes mellitus (48%). Patients with positive myocardial RT-PCR died earlier after hospital admission (5 versus 12 days, p < 0.001) than patients with negative RT-PCR. An increased severity of fibrin deposition, capillary dilatation, and microhaemorrhage was observed in RT-PCR-positive myocardium than in negatives and controls, with a positive correlation amongst these factors All cases with increased cardioinflammatory infiltrate, without myocyte necrosis (n = 4) or with myocarditis (n = 1), were RT-PCR negative. ISH revealed positivity of viral RNA in interstitial cells. Myocardial capillary dilatation, fibrin deposition, and microhaemorrhage may be the histomorphological correlate of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. Increased cardioinflammation including one case of myocarditis was only detected in RT-PCR-negative hearts with significantly longer hospitalisation time.

The relevance of studying the human psychological reactions caused by the unpredictable aggravation of the worldwide epidemiological situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is growing. The purpose of the research is to analyse the dynamics of impact of forced self-isolation and the situation engendered by the spread of COVID-19 on the psycho-emotional state of the students and the teaching staff of the Institute of Pedagogy under Belgorod State National Research University, and their treatment of this situation. Materials and methods. The research was carried out in remote mode through the online service “Google Forms” in April and October 2020. The number of students and teachers of the Institute of Pedagogy under Belgorod State National Research University that took part in the questioning was 1620. The questionnaire consisted of 3 blocks, including the feedback forms: “My emotional state” (Gut, Doronina);“Actual mental state” (Kulikov);Spielberger’s State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The processing of the research results was carried out with the use of the statistical package SPSS 25.0. Results. It was revealed that most of the respondents, during both the first and the second diagnostic assessment periods, complied entirely with the coronavirus prevention measures and did not visit crowded public places: 79.1% and 70%, respectively. Following the study of the actual emotional state of the tested people during the first and second waves, some reliably significant differences in terms of indicators were revealed: “Physical well-being” (temp=-2.7;р≤0.01), “Tranquility-anxiety” (temp = -4.2;p≤0.01), “Emotional excitement” (temp = -3.1;p≤0.01). Discussion and conclusion. The results of the comparative analysis of the respondents’ answers in respect of the first and second waves of the coronavirus spread made it possible to conclude that the tested people had revaluated the COVID situation and started treating this phenomenon in more prudent and serious terms. In addition, the prolonged stay-at-home regime, along with limited communication and relocation, results in cumulation of psychological fatigue, increased emotional strain, which conditions the need for informational and psychological support of university students and teachers during the pandemic and after it. © 2021 LLC Ecological Help.

Based on this hypothesis, several immunosuppressant agents are currently being tested as potential treatment for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: report a patient treated with alemtuzumab (Humanized monoclonal antibody against the lymphocyte and monocyte surface antigen CD52, which depletes B and T cells) (Thompson et al., 2018) for recurrent remittent multiple sclerosis (RRMS) who developed mild COVID-19. RESULTS: Despite complete B and T cell depletion, patient symptoms abated few days with no need for hospitalization due to COVID-19 and no clinical evidence of disease activation regarding her MS.

The aim of this study was to assess whether chronic lung disease or use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) affects the risk of contracting severe COVID-19. METHODS: In this population cohort study, records from 1205 general practices in England that contribute to the QResearch database were linked to Public Health England's database of SARS-CoV-2 testing and English hospital admissions, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and deaths for COVID-19. All patients aged 20 years and older who were registered with one of the 1205 general practices on Jan 24, 2020, were included in this study. With Cox regression, we examined the risks of COVID-19-related hospitalisation, admission to ICU, and death in relation to respiratory disease and use of ICS, adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic status and comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19. FINDINGS: Between Jan 24 and April 30, 2020, 8 256 161 people were included in the cohort and observed, of whom 14 479 (0·2%) were admitted to hospital with COVID-19, 1542 (<0·1%) were admitted to ICU, and 5956 (0·1%) died. People with some respiratory diseases were at an increased risk of hospitalisation (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] hazard ratio [HR] 1·54 [95% CI 1·45-1·63], asthma 1·18 [1·13-1·24], severe asthma 1·29 [1·22-1·37; people on three or more current asthma medications], bronchiectasis 1·34 [1·20-1·50], sarcoidosis 1·36 [1·10-1·68], extrinsic allergic alveolitis 1·35 [0·82-2·21], idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 1·59 [1·30-1·95], other interstitial lung disease 1·66 [1·30-2·12], and lung cancer 2·24 [1·89-2·65]) and death (COPD 1·54 [1·42-1·67], asthma 0·99 [0·91-1·07], severe asthma 1·08 [0·98-1·19], bronchiectasis 1·12 [0·94-1·33], sarcoidosis 1·41 [0·99-1·99), extrinsic allergic alveolitis 1·56 [0·78-3·13], idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 1·47 [1·12-1·92], other interstitial lung disease 2·05 [1·49-2·81], and lung cancer 1·77 [1·37-2·29]) due to COVID-19 compared with those without these diseases. Admission to ICU was rare, but the HR for people with asthma was 1·08 (0·93-1·25) and severe asthma was 1·30 (1·08-1·58). In a post-hoc analysis, relative risks of severe COVID-19 in people with respiratory disease were similar before and after shielding was introduced on March 23, 2020. In another post-hoc analysis, people with two or more prescriptions for ICS in the 150 days before study start were at a slightly higher risk of severe COVID-19 compared with all other individuals (ie, no or one ICS prescription): HR 1·13 (1·03-1·23) for hospitalisation, 1·63 (1·18-2·24) for ICU admission, and 1·15 (1·01-1·31) for death. INTERPRETATION: The risk of severe COVID-19 in people with asthma is relatively small. People with COPD and interstitial lung disease appear to have a modestly increased risk of severe disease, but their risk of death from COVID-19 at the height of the epidemic was mostly far lower than the ordinary risk of death from any cause.

Knowledge can influence healthcare professionals through adoption of the correct attitudes and practices. The aim of this study was to evaluate, by a questionnaire, the perceptions of physicians about their level of knowledge as well as conditions in their workplaces for dealing with COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of Angolan physicians took place from 11 May to 23 June 2020. A questionnaire was electronically shared across social media and via email. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 637 valid questionnaires; 53% of respondents were female, 41% were aged 31-40 y and 79% were from Luanda province. About 51% of physicians perceived that they had adequate knowledge about COVID-19 and 64% used personal protective equipment. These figures were higher among specialists from the province of Luanda. About 81% stated that their health units lacked the technical capacity to diagnose COVID-19. Only 35% of health units have chest tomography equipment; 44% are prepared for the care and/or isolation of patients. Only 33% of units are running intensive care units. The main concerns of physicians were training opportunities and limited access to personal protective equipment. CONCLUSION: The results show that it is necessary to strengthen physicians' knowledge about COVID-19, as well as to improve the conditions of the health units, so as to promote safe practices.","Arrais, Margarete; Dias, Welwitschia; Gama, Jorge M R; Brito, Miguel",International health (Online),853,6

It examines indicators across five broad domains: climate change impacts, exposures and vulnerability; adaptation, planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement. In the wake of the unprecedented and catastrophic 2019-20 Australian bushfire season, in this special report we present the 2020 update, with a focus on the relationship between health, climate change and bushfires, highlighting indicators that explore these linkages. In an environment of continuing increases in summer maximum temperatures and heatwave intensity, substantial increases in both fire risk and population exposure to bushfires are having an impact on Australia's health and economy. As a result of the ""Black Summer"" bushfires, the monthly airborne particulate matter less than 2.5 µm in diameter (PM2.5 ) concentrations in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory in December 2019 were the highest of any month in any state or territory over the period 2000-2019 at 26.0 µg/m3 and 71.6 µg/m3 respectively, and insured economic losses were $2.2 billion. We also found growing awareness of and engagement with the links between health and climate change, with a 50% increase in scientific publications and a doubling of newspaper articles on the topic in Australia in 2019 compared with 2018. However, despite clear and present need, Australia still lacks a nationwide adaptation plan for health. As Australia recovers from the compounded effects of the bushfires and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the health profession has a pivotal role to play. It is uniquely suited to integrate the response to these short term threats with the longer term public health implications of climate change, and to argue for the economic recovery from COVID-19 to align with and strengthen Australia's commitments under the Paris Agreement.","Zhang, Ying; Beggs, Paul J; McGushin, Alice; Bambrick, Hilary; Trueck, Stefan; Hanigan, Ivan C; Morgan, Geoffrey G; Berry, Helen L; Linnenluecke, Martina K; Johnston, Fay H; Capon, Anthony G; Watts, Nick",Med. j.

There is increasing evidence that sialylated compounds of cellular glycocalyx can serve as an important factor in the mechanism of CoVs infection. Additionally, the sialic acid-mediated cross-reactivity with the host immune lectins is known to exert the immune response of different intensity in selected pathological stages.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review article is to provide a summary of the diagnosis and management of MIS-C with a focus on management in the acute care setting. DISCUSSION: MIS-C is an inflammatory syndrome which can affect nearly any organ system. The most common symptoms are fever and gastrointestinal symptoms, though neurologic and dermatologic findings are also well-described. The diagnosis includes a combination of clinical and laboratory testing. Patients with MIS-C will often have elevated inflammatory markers and may have an abnormal electrocardiogram or echocardiogram. Initial treatment involves resuscitation with careful assessment for cardiac versus vasodilatory shock using point-of-care ultrasound. Treatment should include intravenous immunoglobulin, anticoagulation, and consideration of corticosteroids. Interleukin-1 and/or interleukin-6 blockade may be considered for refractory cases. Aspirin is recommended if there is thrombocytosis or Kawasaki disease-like features on echocardiogram. Patients will generally require admission to an intensive care unit. CONCLUSION: MIS-C is a condition associated with morbidity and mortality that is increasingly recognized as a potential complication in pediatric patients with COVID-19. It is important for emergency clinicians to know how to diagnose and treat this disorder.","Gottlieb, Michael; Bridwell, Rachel; Ravera, Joseph; Long, Brit",Am J Emerg Med,853,1

RNA viruses can encode microRNAs (miRNAs) capable of modulating host gene expression, and with that notion, we aimed to predict viral miRNA like sequences of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, analyze sequence reciprocity and investigate SARS-CoV-2 encoded potential miRNA-human genes interaction using bioinformatics tools. In this study, we retrieved 206 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, executed phylogenetic analysis, and the selected reference genome (MT434792.1) exhibited about 99% similarities among the retrieved genomes. We predicted 402, 137, and 85 putative miRNAs of MERS-CoV (NC_019843.3), SARS-CoV (NC_004718.3), and SARS-CoV-2 (MT434792.1) genome, respectively. Sequence similarity was analyzed among 624 miRNAs which revealed that the predicted miRNAs of SARS-CoV-2 share a cluster with the clad of miRNAs from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Only SARS-CoV-2 derived 85 miRNAs were encountered for target prediction and 29 viral miRNAs seemed to target 119 human genes. Moreover, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis suggested the involvement of respective genes in various pathways and biological processes. Finally, we focused on eight putative miRNAs influencing 14 genes that are involved in the adaptive hypoxic response, neuroinvasion and hormonal regulation, and tumorigenic progression in patients with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 encoded miRNAs may cause misexpression of some critical regulators and facilitate viral neuroinvasion, altered hormonal axis, and tumorigenic events in the human host. However, these propositions need validation from future studies.","Roy, Sawrab; Sharma, Binayok; Mazid, Md Ishtiaque; Akhand, Rubaiat Nazneen; Das, Moumita; Marufatuzzahan, Marufatuzzahan; Chowdhury, Tanjia Afrin; Azim, Kazi Faizul; Hasan, Mahmudul",Comput Biol Med,853,1

Human coronavirus (HCoV)-NL63 is a coronavirus that could cause mortality among patients with underlying disease complications. Serological tests are of limited diagnostic value in immunocompromised hosts and cases of latent infection reactivation. In contrast, macro-genomic high-throughput (DNA and RNA) sequencing allows for rapid and accurate diagnosis of infecting pathogens for targeted treatment. PATIENT CONCERNS: In this report, we describe a patient who exhibited acute B-lymphocytic leukemia and developed complicated pulmonary HCoV-NL63 infection after a second allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT). Six months after the second allo-HSCT, he developed sudden-onset hyperthermia and cough with decreased oxygen saturation. Chest computed tomography (CT) suggested bilateral multiple rounded ground-glass opacities with the pulmonary lobules as units. DIAGNOSES: HCoV-NL63 was detected by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (NGS), and HCoV-NL63 viral pneumonia was diagnosed. INTERVENTIONS: The treatment was mainly based on the use of antiviral therapy, hormone administration, and gamma-globulin. OUTCOMES: After the therapy, the body temperature returned to normal, the chest CT findings had improved on review, and the viral copy number eventually became negative. LESSONS: The latest NGS is an effective method for early infection diagnosis. The HCoV-NL63 virus can cause inflammatory factor storm and alter the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). This case suggests that the patient's NLR and cytokine levels could be monitored during the clinical treatment to assess the disease and its treatment outcome in a timely manner.","Li, Zhihui; Meng, Shuo; Zheng, Qinlong; Wu, Tong",Medicine (Baltimore),853,21

The virus is shed into various body fluids including saliva, which represents a possible source of viral transmission. Thus, we here explored whether human saliva affects ZIKV infectivity. We found that physiological concentrations of pooled saliva dose-dependently inhibit ZIKV infection of monkey and human cells by preventing viral attachment to target cells. The anti-ZIKV activity in saliva could not be abrogated by boiling, suggesting the antiviral factor is not a protein. Instead, we found that purified extracellular vesicles (EVs) from saliva inhibit ZIKV infection. Salivary EVs (saEVs) express typical EV markers such as tetraspanins CD9, CD63 and CD81 and prevent ZIKV attachment to and infection of target cells at concentrations that are naturally present in saliva. The anti-ZIKV activity of saliva is conserved but the magnitude of inhibition varies between individual donors. In contrast to ZIKV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), predominantly spreading via respiratory droplets, is not affected by saliva or saEVs. Our findings provide a plausible explanation for why ZIKV transmission via saliva, i.e. by deep kissing have not been recorded and establish a novel oral innate immune defence mechanism against some viral pathogens.","Conzelmann, Carina; Groß, Rüdiger; Zou, Min; Krüger, Franziska; Görgens, André; Gustafsson, Manuela O; El Andaloussi, Samir; Münch, Jan; Müller, Janis A.",J.

Therapeutic approaches to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection are mostly focused on blocking S-ACE2 binding, but critical residues that stabilize this interaction are not well understood. By performing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified an extended network of salt bridges, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonds between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein and ACE2. Mutagenesis of these residues on the RBD was not sufficient to destabilize binding but reduced the average work to unbind the S protein from ACE2. In particular, the hydrophobic end of RBD serves as the main anchor site and is the last to unbind from ACE2 under force. We propose that blocking the hydrophobic surface of RBD via neutralizing antibodies could prove to be an effective strategy to inhibit S-ACE2 interactions.","Taka, Elhan; Yilmaz, Sema Z; Golcuk, Mert; Kilinc, Ceren; Aktas, Umut; Yildiz, Ahmet; Gur, Mert",J. phys. chem.

This has resulted in a cessation of normal face-to-face services and patient advice can only be offered by remote means. A service evaluation was carried out to assess the quality of information published on websites and social media pages of specialist orthodontic practices in London, against General Dental Council guidance on communication and advertising and the British Orthodontic Society (BOS) COVID-19 specific guidance for orthodontics in primary care in relation to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study also aimed to provide a gold standard template for orthodontic practices to aid in the delivery of information on a digital platform during the current (COVID-19) pandemic and future possible spikes. Materials and methods: All orthodontic practices providing care in the London region were identified from a CQC Database and subsequently checked against predetermined criteria based on the BOS guidance and the GDC Guidance on Ethical Advertising. Results: Of the 83 orthodontic practices sampled; 78 had a website of which 18 (23.1%) were non-compliant with GDC guidance. Facebook pages were identified for 62 orthodontic practices. 17 practices did not provide any update in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was more frequently carried out on practice websites (78.2%) compared to Facebook pages (33.9%). A number of practices were identified as having novel strategies to manage communication during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Variation was observed in information published by practices despite the regularly updated, blanket information provided by the BOS. Communication may have been delivered by a different means during the pandemic which this study did not account for. In addition, the sampling method may not have identified all practices within the London region, however the sample size seems appropriate to draw meaningful conclusions.

The risk of severe manifestations and mortality characteristically increase in the elderly and in the presence of non-COVID-19 comorbidity. We and others previously demonstrated that the low molecular weight (LMW) and protein thiol/disulfide ratio declines in human plasma with age and such decline is even more rapid in the case of inflammatory and premature aging diseases, which are also associated with the most severe complications of COVID-19 infection. The same decline with age of the LMW thiol/disulfide ratio observed in plasma appears to occur in the extracellular fluids of the respiratory tract and in association with many pulmonary diseases that characteristically reduce the concentrations and adaptive stress response of the lung glutathione. Early evidence in literature suggests that the thiol to disulfide balance of critical Cys residues of the COVID-19 spike protein and the ACE-2 receptor may influence the risk of infection and the severity of the disease, with a more oxidizing environment producing the worst prognosis. With this hypothesis paper we propose that the age-dependent decline of LMW thiol/disulfide ratio of the extracellular fluids, could play a role in promoting the physical (protein-protein) interaction of CoV-2 and the host cell in the airways. Therefore, this redox-dependent interaction is expected to affect the risk of severe infection in an age-dependent manner. The hypothesis can be verified in experimental models of in vitro CoV-2 infection and at the clinical level in that LMW thiols and protein thiolation can now be investigated with standardized, reliable and versatile laboratory protocols. Presenting the verification strategy of our hypothesis, we also discuss available nutritional and ancillary pharmacological strategies to intervene on the thiol/disulfide ratio of extracellular fluids of subjects at risk of infection and COVID-19 patients.","Giustarini, Daniela; Santucci, Annalisa; Bartolini, Desirée; Galli, Francesco; Rossi, Ranieri",Redox Biol,853,16

METHODS: This was a prospective, longitudinal observational study. Adult patients with HNC undergoing RT between March 2017 and August 2018 were recruited. Patients' body compositions were evaluated by bioelectrical impedance analysis, and dietary intake was recorded by 24-hour dietary recall at three time points, including baseline (T1), mid-treatment (T2) and post-treatment (T3). Patients were divided into low, middle and high energy intake groups based on the average daily energy intake (DEI). Changes in body weight (BW), fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM) and skeletal muscle mass (SMM) among these three groups were compared. RESULTS: From T1 to T3, the median loss of patients' BW, FM, FFM and SMM was 4.60, 1.90, 2.60 and 1.50 kg, respectively. The loss of BW was more dramatic from T2 to T3 than that from T1 to T2. BW loss was mainly contributed by SMM loss from T1 to T2 and by FM loss from T2 to T3. Meanwhile, patients' dietary intake reduced during treatment. High DEI group had a significantly attenuated loss of patients' BW, FFM, SMM and FM compared with the low DEI group. CONCLUSION: Patients' BW, FM, FFM and SMM all significantly reduced, especially from T2 to T3, with decreased DEI during RT, which stresses the importance of nutrition intervention during the whole course of RT.","Zhuang, Bing; Zhang, Lichuan; Wang, Yujie; Cao, Yiwei; Shih, Yian; Jin, Sanli; Li, Hongmei; Gong, Liqing; Wang, Yanli; Jin, Shuai; Lu, Qian",BMJ support. palliat. care (Online),853,21

Reports on symptoms of COVID-19 are non-specific and known to vary from asymptomatic, mild to severe, or fatal. This study aimed to analyze the symptomatic and clinical characteristics of study participants based on the medical records of participants hospitalized with COVID-19 in Uzbekistan. METHODS: We collected all data from medical records of COVID-19 confirmed patients in 19 hospitals from 13 regions of Uzbekistan between March 15 and April 30. We selected 1,030 patients discharged from the hospitals after COVID-19 treatment as study participants, excluding those with missing data. Further, we collected demographics, symptoms, clinical outcomes, and treatment data through medical records. RESULTS: More than half (57.6%) of confirmed cases of COVID-19 were males, and the median age was 36.0 years. The most frequent symptoms at the first inspection on hospital admission of all patients were fatigue (59.7%), dry cough (54.1%), pharyngalgia (31.6%), headache (20.6%), and anorexia (12.5%). Compared to the oldest group, the youngest group showed a lower frequency of symptoms. About half of the group aged 18-49 years reported that they came from abroad. One-fifth of patients in group 50-84 received oxygen support, while no patients in group aged 0-17 years received oxygen support. About two-thirds of the participants from intensive care unit (ICU) came from abroad, whereas 42.1% of the non-ICU group returned from other countries. Regarding symptoms, 16.9% of the patients in the ICU group were asymptomatic, while 5.8% in the non-ICU group were asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the medical delivery system and resource distribution need to be implemented based on clinical characteristics by age and severity to delay and effectively respond to the spread of infections in the future.

The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of collecting and processing of CCP, in preparation for a randomized clinical trial of CCP for treatment of COVID-19 in Uganda. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, persons with documented evidence of recovery from COVID-19 in Uganda were contacted and screened for blood donation via telephone calls. Those found eligible were asked to come to the blood donation centre for further screening and consent. Whole blood collection was undertaken from which plasma was processed. Plasma was tested for transfusion transmissible infections (TTIs) and anti-SARS CoV-2 antibody titers. SARS-CoV-2 testing was also done on nasopharyngeal swabs from the donors.

A rise in the spread of misinformation is thought to have played a significant role in vaccine hesitancy. To maximize uptake, it is important to understand why misinformation has been able to take hold at this time and why it may pose a more significant problem within certain contexts. OBJECTIVE: To understand people's COVID-19 beliefs, their interactions with (mis)information during COVID-19 and attitudes towards a COVID-19 vaccine. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Bradford, UK, was chosen as the study site to provide evidence to local decision makers. In-depth phone interviews were carried out with 20 people from different ethnic groups and areas of Bradford during Autumn 2020. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Participants discussed a wide range of COVID-19 misinformation they had encountered, resulting in confusion, distress and mistrust. Vaccine hesitancy could be attributed to three prominent factors: safety concerns, negative stories and personal knowledge. The more confused, distressed and mistrusting participants felt about their social worlds during the pandemic, the less positive they were about a vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy needs to be understood in the context of the relationship between the spread of misinformation and associated emotional reactions. Vaccine programmes should provide a focused, localized and empathetic response to counter misinformation. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: A rapid community and stakeholder engagement process was undertaken to identify COVID-19 priority topics important to Bradford citizens and decision makers.","Lockyer, Bridget; Islam, Shahid; Rahman, Aamnah; Dickerson, Josie; Pickett, Kate; Sheldon, Trevor; Wright, John; McEachan, Rosemary; Sheard, Laura",Health expect,853,16

All viruses described to date entirely rely on the protein synthesis machinery of the host cells to produce proteins required for their replication and spread. As such, virus often need to control the cellular translational apparatus to avoid the first line of the cellular defense intended to limit the viral propagation. Thus, coronaviruses have developed remarkable strategies to hijack the host translational machinery in order to favor viral protein production. In this review, we will describe some of these strategies and will highlight the role of viral proteins and RNAs in this process.","de Breyne, Sylvain; Vindry, Caroline; Guillin, Olivia; Condé, Lionel; Mure, Fabrice; Gruffat, Henri; Chavatte, Laurent; Ohlmann, Théophile",Nucleic acids res,853,16

In the recent past, Nigerian universities have started to respond to these cyber-attacks. Many of them now invest in anti-cybercrime tools and programs to mitigate cyber security threats and breaches. Despite this, the number of times Nigerian universities suffer from cyber-attacks and the losses that result from them keeps increasing. Our observation, however, indicates that most Nigerian universities run their cyber security without using scientifically derived frameworks that spell out how to manage threats and breaches that emanate from within and outside them. We consider this a problem to ongoing efforts made by Nigerian universities to mitigate cyber security threats and breaches. The study reported in this paper was therefore, carried out to explicate how Nigerian universities can develop actionable frameworks that can help them to mitigate cyber security threats and breaches. The study is based on literature review and propose how an actionable framework that Nigerian Universities can adopt to setoff cybersecurity programs can be developed. The process comprises of problem identification, description of objectives, designing and developing the artefact, testing, and evaluating the artefact, and communicating the result.

Findings: We see these widening disparities as not only as threats to human health, societal stability, and planetary health, but also as moral wrongs - outward manifestations of unrecognized privilege and greed. They are the concrete consequences of policies that promote structural violence and institutionalize racism. Recommendations: We encourage governments to take the following three scientific and ethical justified actions to reduce disparities, prevent future pandemics, and advance the common good: (1) Invest in public health systems; (2) Reduce economic inequities by making health care affordable to all; providing education, including early education, to all children; strengthening environmental and occupational safeguards; and creating more just tax structures; and (3) Preserve our Common Home, the small blue planet on which we all live.","Landrigan, Philip J; Ferrer, Lilian; Keenan, James",Ann Glob Health,853,29

The algorithm takes input from citizens and schedules the store's time-slots based on their importance to visit the facility (e.g., a general store). Naturally, the formulation applies to several similar problems. We consider the single slot and multiple slot demands of the requests. The salient properties of our approach are: it (a) ensures social distancing by ensuring a maximum population in a given time-slot at the facility, (b) prioritizes individuals based on the users' importance of the jobs, (c) maintains truthfulness of the reported importance by adding a cooling-off period after their allocated time-slot, during which the individual cannot re-access the same facility, (d) guarantees voluntary participation of the citizens, and yet (e) is computationally tractable. We show that the problem becomes NP-complete as soon as the multi-slot demands are indivisible and provide a polynomial-time mechanism that is truthful, individually rational, and approximately optimal. Experiments show that visitors with more important jobs are allocated more preferred slots, which comes at the cost of a longer delay to re-access the store. We show that it reduces the social congestion significantly using users' visit data from a store.

The ""cortical spread"" of grey matter loss in schizophrenia and the mid-pericallosal ""congestion"" in fMRI of periodic catatonia - treatable electromagnetically along arteries - are interpreted in terms of the fastest interstitial outflow through the Cerebral IntraMural Reverse Arterial Flow-engine (CIMURAF, Treviranus 2018-19) draining ""waste"" via arterio-adventitial lymphatics to the neck. Such repetitively sliding segments of CIMURAF are wrung downstream by muscles likely steered by the neurovascular pterygopalatine ganglion. At the pericallosal artery, along its ideal long straight segment, this likely happens diverging from the mid-callosum towards the front and the back. In the case of a convergent inversion a mid-callosal clash will result, which is observable in psychoses as a mid-callosal high-flow-spot simultaneously with hyper-perfusions of branches and ""backwatering"" of pial vessels with reactive waste - till date interpreted psycho-mathematically. CIMURAF might also accelerate the perivascular intrusion of MCs by flushing autocrine signals (of which electro-magnetism moves the dipoles) through a putative periadventitial counter-current. Psychoses plausible occur through tryptase-mediated attacks operated by mast cells against oligodendrocytes' cytoskeleton (Medic 2009) and probably via complement-4 (Schizophrenia WG, 2014) against neurons. Usually MCs are essential long-lived ""orchestrators"" of homeostases and immune or barrier defences interacting with nerves, immunocytes, organs, and routes. MCs after somatic programming as to ""destination & destiny"" (Treviranus 2017a, 6.2., 2018) rapidly intrude also into the brain's parenchyma, first within the lymphatics and then putatively by crossing-over to extraluminal arterial routes. MCs transverse the BBBs, while macrophages only trespass in ""disease"" (Faraco et al. 2017). Both can be ""subverted"" by a list of microbes (and putatively blown up by COVID-19 within walls). Enuresis and MCs' reactions to clozapine add to the interactive support from (epi-)genetics and imaging.","Treviranus, Gottfried R S",Psychiatr Danub,853,1

A single well-resolved relaxation process dominates the experimental acoustic spectra following a Debye-type distribution function. The analysis of the temperature-dependent ultrasonic relaxation data also revealed analogous effect with concentration on the relaxation spectra. All acoustic parameters were estimated by means of a fitting procedure. The behavior of the relaxation frequency and amplitude with concentration allowed us to assign the observed process to self-association mechanism. Combining the ultrasonic and electric conductivity data, the self-association scheme has been established. The thermodynamic constants and the rate of the aggregation due to hydrophobic interactions have been estimated in view of the Eyring’s theory. The concentration dependence of relaxation amplitude and characteristic frequency revealed that the presence of additional relaxation processes in the spectra related to additional mechanisms, such as conformational changes and proton-transfer reaction is excluded and the self-association process considered here was found to dominate in this frequency range. The results have been discussed in view of the fair ability of DSP for hydrophobic interactions and aggregate formation in aqueous environment.

The aim of this experiment was to compare the pathogenicity of European avian-like swine H1N1 and European human-like reassortant swine H1N2 viruses in naïve pigs and in pigs previously infected with Mhp. Six groups of SPF pigs were inoculated intra-tracheally with either Mhp, or H1N1, or H1N2 or Mhp + H1N1 or Mhp + H1N2, both pathogens being inoculated at 21 days intervals in these two last groups. A mock-infected group was included. Although both SIV strains induced clinical signs when singly inoculated, results indicated that the H1N2 SIV was more pathogenic than the H1N1 virus, with an earlier shedding and a greater spread in lungs. Initial infection with Mhp before SIV inoculation increased flu clinical signs and pathogenesis (hyperthermia, loss of appetite, pneumonia lesions) due to the H1N1 virus but did not modify significantly outcomes of H1N2 infection. Thus, Mhp and SIV H1N1 appeared to act synergistically, whereas Mhp and SIV H1N2 would compete, as H1N2 infection led to the elimination of Mhp in lung diaphragmatic lobes. In conclusion, SIV would be a risk factor for the severity of respiratory disorders when associated with Mhp, depending on the viral subtype involved. This experimental model of coinfection with Mhp and avian-like swine H1N1 is a relevant tool for studying the pathogenesis of SIV-associated PRDC and testing intervention strategies for the control of the disease.","Deblanc, C.; Gorin, S.; Quéguiner, S.; Gautier-Bouchardon, A.V.; Ferré, S.; Amenna, N.; Cariolet, R.; Simon, G.",Vet Microbiol,853,20

Saliva droplets containing SARS-COV-2 are a major vector for COVID-19 infection, making saliva a promising alternative for COVID-19 testing using nasopharyngeal swab samples. To diagnose COVID-19 patients in the field, a point-of-care test (POCT) using saliva was conceptualized. We have developed a simple method for extracting RNA from saliva samples using semi-alkaline proteinase, a sputum homogenizer typically used for preparing samples for tuberculosis testing, and a subsequent simple heating step with no need for centrifugation or RNA extraction. Further, we newly developed a triplex reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification approach (RT-LAMP) which utilizes colorimetric readout using a heat block, with results evaluated with the unaided eye. In 44 clinical patients suspected of having COVID-19 infection, the test took 45 min, and resulted in a diagnostic sensitivity of 82.6% (19/23) and diagnostic specificity of 100% (21/21), compared to the reference standard. The limit of detection was 250 copies/reaction (25,000 copies/mL). Our newly developed POCT approach achieved simple RNA extraction and constant RT-LAMP detection. This POCT has the potential to be used for simple inspection stations in a field setting, helping reduce the risk of infection by simplifying and accelerating testing for COVID-19.","Yamazaki, Wataru; Matsumura, Yasufumi; Thongchankaew-Seo, Uraiwan; Yamazaki, Yasuko; Nagao, Miki",J Clin Virol,853,26

Some clinicians who were already experiencing a rise in burnout due to the mass digitization of healthcare are now facing increased moral distress due to ethical dilemmas, pervasive uncertainty, boundary ambiguity, isolation, and burnout brought about by emerging COVID‐19 policies. Fears about personal safety, exposing loved ones, financial concerns, self‐doubt, and frustrations with telehealth have contributed to increased moral distress during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Building resilience by setting one's personal moral compass can help clinicians avoid the pitfalls of moral distress.

This paper discusses the interplay between ABHS input (formulation) factors and output (product performance) factors in the context of a multidimensional perspective using a novel representative paradigm. In the model, represented in the form of a three-dimensional tetrahedron, each of the faces represents inputs in the manufacturing of the ABHS product, which are the type and amount of alcohol, the inactive ingredients, the formulation and the manufacturing practices. The four corners of the tetrahedron represent the product performance factors which include product efficacy, sensory characteristics, usage and compliance and product safety. The multidimensional approach to the formulation and evaluation of ABHS shows that several factors contribute to the effectiveness and utility of these products.

The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) emerged as a promising drug target because of its essential role in the processing of polyproteins, which is translated from viral RNA. The present study reports a designed novel hybrid antiviral molecule (VTRRT-13.V2.1) against SARS-CoV2 main protease. A series of different combinations of hybrid antiviral were generated from nonspecific antiviral molecules currently used to control COVID-19. To enhance the specificity of the designed hybrid antiviral molecule, the core pocket region of the active site of M(pro) protein was targeted. In-silico screening, molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) analysis identified a hybrid VTRRT-13.V2 molecule. Retrosynthetic analysis and combinatorial synthesis generated 1000 analogs of VTRRT-13.V2 molecules. Docking, molecular mechanics, and MDS analysis selected VTRRT-13.V2.1 as a possible inhibitor for SARS-CoV2 main protease. Comparative analysis of all the results showed that VTRRT-13.V2.1 have the highest docking Glide score (-12.28 kcal/mol) and best binding energy (-52.23 kcal/mol) as compared to the other hybrid constructs such as VTRRT-13.V2 (-9.47 and -47.36 kcal/mol), VTRRT-13 (-8.9 and -47.55 kcal/mol), and current antiviral investigated. The mutational sensitivity screening showed that binding residues of M(pro) are not present in mutation hotspots. It was also observed that VTRRT-13.V2.1 does not have any human off-targets. SARS-CoV2 main protease is essential for the survival of this virus; hence, a designed novel hybrid antiviral molecule (VTRRT-13.V2.1) might be useful to control the infection of COVID-19 infection.","Tiwari, Vishvanath",Heliyon,853,24

Although it is widely known about its pulmonary presence and ensuing complications, evidence is emerging that there are other organ systems including the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems that may be damaged by this virus. There have been reports of large vessel stroke occurring in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) positive patients, with very few reported in the age group less than 50 years. In this case, we describe a previously healthy 49-year-old male who presented with signs of stroke, and was found to have the novel coronavirus as he had been suffering from upper respiratory tract symptoms for 3 weeks. He subsequently developed further large vessel stroke while in the hospital despite being started on antiplatelet therapy. He was also found to have new onset cardiomyopathy. He was started on anticoagulation and discharged with follow-up for cardiomyopathy testing outpatient. This case begs the question on which anticoagulation to utilize in COVID-19 positive patients to be effective in preventing thrombotic events. It is postulated that a pro-inflammatory state induced by the virus and the virus’ affinity for angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptors in the cerebral vasculature are predispositions to cause a stroke. The virus also directly damages cardiac myocytes causing a number of cardiac complications including cardiomyopathy. It is crucial that guidelines on anticoagulation choice and indications for when to start anticoagulation be developed in order to prevent the more devastating consequences of thrombosis and embolism and their subsequent clinical sequelae.","Chaughtai, Saira; Soomro, Rabail; Chaughtai, Khaula; Anwaar, Waleed; Chaughtai, Zeeshan; Asif, Arif; Hossain, Mohammad A.",J Med Cases,853,20

As one of the European countries experiencing one of the worst COVID-19 epidemics, the UK government at the end of March 2020 implemented the biggest lockdown of society during peacetime in British history, aiming to contain the rapid spread of the virus. While the lockdown has been maintained for seven weeks in UK, the effectiveness of the control measures in suppressing the transmission of the disease remains incompletely understood. METHOD: We applied a Bayesian SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-removed) epidemiological model to rebuild the local transmission dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in nine regions of England. RESULTS: We found that the basic reproduction number (R(0)) in England is relatively high compared with China. Our estimation of the temporally varying effective reproduction number (R(t)) suggests that the control measures, especially the forceful lockdown, were effective to reduce the transmissibility and curb the COVID-19 epidemic. Although the overall incidence rate in the UK has declined, our forecasting highlights the possibility of a second wave of the disease in several regions, which may be currently underway in one of the cities there (e.g. Leicester, East Midlands).

In addressing mental health needs, web-based interventions have shown increasing promise in overcoming geographic distances and high student-to-counselor ratios, leading to the potential for wider implementation. The Mindfulness Virtual Community (MVC) program, a web-based program, guided by mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy principles, is among efforts aimed at effectively and efficiently reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress in students. OBJECTIVE: This study’s aim was to evaluate the efficacy of an 8-week MVC program in reducing depression, anxiety, and perceived stress (primary outcomes), and improving mindfulness (secondary outcome) in undergraduate students at a large Canadian university. Guided by two prior randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that each demonstrated efficacy when conducted during regular university operations, this study coincided with a university-wide labor strike. Nonetheless, the students’ response to an online mental health program on a disrupted campus can provide useful information for anticipating the impact of other disruptions, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future disruptions. METHODS: In this parallel-arm RCT, 154 students were randomly allocated to an 8-week MVC intervention (n=76) or a wait-list control (WLC) condition (n=78). The MVC intervention included the following: (1) educational and mindfulness video modules, (2) anonymous peer-to-peer discussions, and (3) anonymous, group-based, professionally guided, 20-minute videoconferences. Study outcomes were evaluated at baseline and at 8-week follow-up using the following: Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire Short Form (FFMQ-SF). Generalized estimation equations with an AR (1) covariance structure were used to evaluate the impact of the intervention, with outcome evaluations performed on both an intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) basis. RESULTS: Participants (n=154) included 35 males and 117 females with a mean age of 23.1 years. There were no statistically significant differences at baseline between the MVC and WLC groups on demographics and psychological characteristics, indicating similar demographic and psychological characteristics across the two groups. Results under both ITT and PP approaches indicated that there were no statistically significant between-group differences in PHQ-9 (ITT: β=–0.44, P=.64; PP: β=–0.62, P=.053), BAI (ITT: β=–2.06, P=.31; PP: β=–2.32, P=.27), and FFMQ-SF (ITT: β=1.33, P=.43; PP: β=1.44, P=.41) compared to WLC. There was a significant difference for the PSS (ITT: β=–2.31, P=.03; PP: β=–2.38, P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: During a university labor strike, the MVC program led to statistically significant reductions in PSS compared to the WLC group, but there were no other significant between-group differences.

Total negative pressure isolation using portable bioisolation tents may provide a solution. The study assesses the ability of health care workers to perform emergency procedures in this environment. METHODS: Physician performance in completing predetermined critical actions in 5 emergency care scenarios inside and outside of a bioisolation tent (“setting”) was studied in an advanced medical simulation laboratory. By design, no pretraining of subjects about total negative pressure isolation use occurred. Impact of setting on time to completion of predetermined critical actions was the primary outcome measured. Secondary variables studied included impact of study groups, scenarios, and run order (inside or outside of the tent first). Subjective assessments were obtained through questionnaires. RESULTS: Four teams of 3 physicians completed 5 emergency patient care scenarios during 2 4-hour sessions. Mean time to completion of critical actions was for tent/no tent 298 seconds/284 seconds (P=.69, one way ANOVA), respectively. Mean time to completion for first versus second performance of a scenario in the crossover design was 338 versus 243 (P=.01).

The virus can affect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract as well. Recognizing the various manifestations in every organ system is important because these manifestations can contribute to community-based transmission. Methods: We outline the evidence of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in the GI tract, the effects of the virus on the gut and liver, the presence of the virus in stool samples, and the potential for fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19. Most of the literature sources used in this paper are case studies from China following the surge of COVID-19 infection. Results: In patients with COVID-19, GI symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain have presented in conjunction with respiratory symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath, and cough. Evidence also shows acute hepatocellular injury, indicated by elevated liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase. Fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 is suspected because of the presence of COVID-19 RNA in stool samples of COVID-19–positive patients. Conclusion: Even without the presence of respiratory symptoms, several GI symptoms are associated with COVID-19 infection, as well as possible fecal-oral transmission. Therefore, COVID-19 infection should be considered for patients presenting with primarily GI symptoms.","Groff, Andrew; Kavanaugh, Madison; Ramgobin, Devyani; McClafferty, Brendan; Aggarwal, Chander Shekher; Golamari, Reshma; Jain, Rohit",Ochsner J,853,22

Design Scoping review. Methods Two parallel searches of academic bibliographic databases and grey literature were undertaken. Governments were also contacted for further information where possible. Due to the time-sensitive nature of the review and the need to report the most up-to-date information for an ever-evolving situation, there were no restrictions on language, information sources utilised, publication status, and types of sources of evidence. The AACODS checklist was used to appraise each source of evidence. Outcome measures Publication characteristics, country-specific data points, COVID-19 specific data, demographics of affected HCWs, and public health measures employed Results A total of 152,888 infections and 1413 deaths were reported. Infections were mainly in women (71.6%) and nurses (38.6%), but deaths were mainly in men (70.8%) and doctors (51.4%). Limited data suggested that general practitioners and mental health nurses were the highest risk specialities for deaths. There were 37.17 deaths reported per 100 infections for healthcare workers aged over 70. Europe had the highest absolute numbers of reported infections (119628) and deaths (712), but the Eastern Mediterranean region had the highest number of reported deaths per 100 infections (5.7). Conclusions HCW COVID-19 infections and deaths follow that of the general world population. The reasons for gender and speciality differences require further exploration, as do the low rates reported from Africa and India. Although physicians working in certain specialities may be considered high-risk due to exposure to oronasal secretions, the risk to other specialities must not be underestimated. Elderly HCWs may require assigning to less risky settings such as telemedicine, or administrative positions. Our pragmatic approach provides general trends, and highlights the need for universal guidelines for testing and reporting of infections in HCWs.","Bandyopadhyay, S.; Baticulon, R.

This study is to test the hypothesis that environmental surfaces played important roles in transmission for SARS-CoV-2 during this outbreak. Methods We sampled environmental surfaces including air from common areas in the cruise ship and cabins in which confirmed COVID-19 cases and non-cases had stayed after they left the cabins. We tested the samples for SARS-CoV-2 by rt-PCR and conducted viral isolation. Findings Of 601 samples tested, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected from 58 samples (10%) from case-cabins from which they left 1-17 days before sampling, but not from non-case-cabins. Except for one sample from an air hood in a corridor, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected from samples in common areas. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected from all 14 air samples. RNA was most often detected on the floor around toilet in the bathroom (39%, 13/33, cycle quantification (Cq): 26.21-37.62) and bed pillow (34%, 11/32, Cq: 34.61-38.99). There was no difference in the detection proportion between cabins for symptomatic (15%, 28/189, Cq: 29.79-38.86) and asymptomatic cases (21%, 28/131, Cq: 26.21-38.99). No SARS-CoV-2 virus was isolated from any of the samples. Interpretation The environment around the COVID-19 cases was extensively contaminated from SARS-CoV-2 during COVID-19 outbreak in the cruise ship. Transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients seems to be similar and the environmental surface could involve viral transmission through direct contact.","Outbreak, Taskforce for the COVID-19 Cruise Ship; Yamagishi, Takuya",,853,20

However, limitations that persist in current disease modeling with limited physiological relevancy of human patients skew drug responses, hamper translation of clinical efficacy, and contribute to high clinical attritions. The emergence of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology revolutionizes the paradigm of drug discovery. In particular, iPSC-based three-dimensional (3D) tissue engineering that appears as a promising vehicle of in vitro disease modeling provides more sophisticated tissue architectures and micro-environmental cues than a traditional two-dimensional (2D) culture. Here we discuss 3D based organoids/spheroids that construct the advanced modeling with evolved structural complexity, which propels drug discovery by exhibiting more human specific and diverse pathologies that are not perceived in 2D or animal models. We will then focus on various central nerve system (CNS) disease modeling using human iPSCs, leading to uncovering disease pathogenesis that guides the development of therapeutic strategies. Finally, we will address new opportunities of iPSC-assisted drug discovery with multi-disciplinary approaches from bioengineering to Omics technology. Despite technological challenges, iPSC-derived cytoarchitectures through interactions of diverse cell types mimic patients’ CNS and serve as a platform for therapeutic development and personalized precision medicine.","Qian, Lu; TCW, Julia",Int J Mol Sci,853,5

Severe COVID-19 pneumonia is characterised by refractory hypoxemia with significant shunting due to a combination of alveolar damage, vascular vasoconstriction, and occlusion due to microthrombi. Similar pathological features are seen in extra-pulmonary organs. However, the influence of thrombotic markers on the risk of mechanical ventilation (MV) and the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) is not fully defined. Methods: This was a cross-sectional evaluation of haemostatic and thrombotic markers of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU to determine their predictability for the development of thromboembolism and the need for non-invasive or invasive MV, development of AKI, and mortality. Results: An extended coagulation profile was obtained in 71 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients admitted to the ICU. All patients had acute severe hypoxic respiratory failure and required non-invasive or invasive MV. There were increases in peak D-dimer (3.0 mg/L), factor VIII levels (255 IU/dL) vWF antigen (471 IU/dL) with low ADAMTS13 activity (54.7 IU/dL) compared to the reference ranges. Peak D-dimer was consistently raised in patients who developed AKI and required invasive MV. ADAMTS13/vWF/platelet axis was associated with disease severity, multi-organ dysfunction, and mortality. Conclusions: Haematological abnormalities are a common feature of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. We found peak D-dimer and vWF-ADAMTS13-platelet axis are associated with increased ICU severity and outcome in severe COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU. Larger studies are needed to evaluate this more comprehensively.","Dushianthan, Ahilanandan; Abdul, Nabil; Dmochowski, Josh; James, Izabela; Heesom, Lesley; Westwood, Jennifer; Effney, Judith; Bruty, Sarah; Saeed, Kordo; Rangarajan, Savita; Kazmi, Rashid",Cureus,853,3

Therefore effective prevention and treatment of RTIs remain a high priority worldwide. Preclinical and clinical data highlight the rationale for the use and effectiveness of immunity‐targeted approaches, including targeted immunisations and non‐specific immunomodulation in the prevention and management of recurrent upper RTIs. OBJECTIVE OF REVIEW: The idea of this review was to summarise the current evidence and address key questions concerning the use of conservative and immunity‐targeted approaches to recurrent and chronic URTIs, with a focus on the paediatric population. SEARCH STRATEGY/EVALUATION METHOD: Literature searches were conducted in March 2017 and updated in September 2017 using: Academic Search Complete; CENTRAL; Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition; MEDLINE; clinicaltrials.gov; and Cochrane databases. In total, 84 articles were retrieved and reviewed. Two independent researchers focused on primary and secondary endpoints in systematic reviews, meta‐analyses and randomised, controlled trials, using immunity‐directed strategies as the control group or within a subpopulation of larger studies. Existing guidelines and interventional/observational studies on novel applications were also included. RESULTS: Children are particularly susceptible to RTIs due to the relative immaturity of their immune systems, as well as other potential predisposing factors such as day care attendance and/or toxic environmental factors (eg increased pathogenic microbial exposure and air pollutants). Recurrent URTIs can affect otherwise healthy children, leading to clinical sequelae and complications, including the development of chronic conditions or the need for surgery. Available pre‐clinical and clinical data highlight the rationale for the use and effectiveness of immunity‐targeted approaches, including targeted immunisations (flu and pneumococcal vaccines) and non‐specific immunomodulation (bacterial lysates), in the prevention and management of recurrent croup, tonsillitis, otitis media, recurrent acute rhinosinusitis and chronic rhinosinusitis. CONCLUSIONS: In this review, we summarise the current evidence and provide data demonstrating that some immunity‐targeted strategies, including vaccination and immunomodulation, have proved effective in the treatment and prevention of recurrent and chronic URTIs in children.","Feleszko, Wojciech; Marengo, Ricardo; Vieira, Antonio Sousa; Ratajczak, Karol; Mayorga Butrón, José Luis",Clin Otolaryngol,853,10

Interaction of DC-SIGN with carbohydrate moieties induces maturation of dendritic cells and promotes endocytosis of pathogens which is an important property of these professional antigen presenting cells. Uptake of pathogens by dendritic cells may lead to cross-presentation of antigens or infection of these cells, which ultimately results in activation of virus-specific T cells in draining lymph nodes. Little is known about the interaction of DC-SIGN with influenza A viruses. Here we show that a virus with a non-functional receptor binding site in its hemagglutinin, can replicate in cells expressing DC-SIGN. Also in the absence of sialic acids, which is the receptor for influenza A viruses, these viruses replicate in DC-SIGN expressing cells including human dendritic cells. Furthermore, the efficiency of DC-SIGN mediated infection is dependent on the extent of glycosylation of the viral hemagglutinin.","Hillaire, Marine L. B.; Nieuwkoop, Nella J.; Boon, Adrianus C.

Recently, neurologic alterations have been associated with hRSV infection in children, which include seizures, central apnea, and encephalopathy. Also, hRSV RNA has been detected in cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) from patients with neurological symptoms after hRSV infection. Additionally, previous studies have shown that hRSV can be detected in the lungs and brains of mice exposed to the virus, yet the potential effects of hRSV infection within the central nervous system (CNS) remain unknown. Here, using a murine model for hRSV infection, we show a significant behavior alteration in these animals, up to two months after the virus exposure, as shown in marble-burying tests. hRSV infection also produced the expression of cytokines within the brain, such as IL-4, IL-10, and CCL2. We found that hRSV infection alters the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in mice, allowing the trespassing of macromolecules and leading to increased infiltration of immune cells into the CNS together with an increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain. Finally, we show that hRSV infects murine astrocytes both, in vitro and in vivo. We identified the presence of hRSV in the brain cortex and colocalizes with vWF, MAP-2, Iba-1, and GFAP, which are considered markers for endothelial cells, neurons, microglia, and astrocyte, respectively. hRSV-infected murine astrocytes displayed increased production of nitric oxide (NO) and TNF-α. Our results suggest that hRSV infection alters the BBB permeability to macromolecules and immune cells and induces CNS inflammation which can contribute to the behavioral alterations observed on infected mice. A better understanding of the neuropathy caused by hRSV could help to reduce the potential detrimental effects on the CNS in hRSV-infected patients.","Bohmwald, Karen; Soto, Jorge A.; Andrade, Catalina; Fernández-Fierro, Ayleen; Espinoza, Janyra A.; Ríos, Mariana; Eugenin, Eliseo A.; González, Pablo A.; Opazo, María Cecilia; Riedel, Claudia A.; Kalergis, Alexis M.",Brain Behav Immun,853,18

Moreover, positive SARS-CoV-2 patients with underlying cardiovascular disease are more likely to require intensive care and are at higher risk of death. The underlying mechanism for myocardial injury is multifaceted, in which the severe inflammatory response causes myocardial inflammation, coronary plaque destabilization, acute thrombotic events, and ischemia. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is the non-invasive method of choice for identifying myocardial injury, and it is able to differentiate between underlying causes in various and often challenging clinical scenarios. Multimodal imaging protocols that incorporate CMR and computed tomography provide a complex evaluation for both respiratory and cardiovascular complications of SARS-CoV2 infection. This, in relation to biological evaluation of systemic inflammation, can guide appropriate therapeutic management in every stage of the disease. The use of artificial intelligence can further improve the diagnostic accuracy of these imaging techniques, thus enabling risk stratification and evaluation of prognosis. The present manuscript aims to review the current knowledge on the possible modalities for imaging COVID-related myocardial inflammation or post-COVID coronary inflammation and atherosclerosis.","Mester, Andras; Benedek, Imre; Rat, Nora; Tolescu, Cosmin; Polexa, Stefania Alexandra; Benedek, Theodora",Diagnostics (Basel),853,1

Spike protein is an important target for both vaccines and therapeutics. Insights into the mechanisms of spike‐ACE2 binding and cell fusion could support the identification of compounds with inhibitory effects. Here, we demonstrate that the integrity of disulfide bonds within the receptor‐binding domain (RBD) plays an important role in the membrane fusion process although their disruption does not prevent binding of spike protein to ACE2. Several reducing agents and thiol‐reactive compounds are able to inhibit viral entry.

As this virus spread rapidly, it became a matter of time before many countries began to implement measures to try and contain the spread of the disease. COVID-19 as it is referred to, resulted in two main approaches to fighting the viral pandemic, either through a progressive set of measures to slow down the number of identified cases designed to ‘flatten the curve’ over time (anticipated to be at least six months), or to attack it by the severest of measures including a total lock-down and/or herding exposure to fast track ‘immunisation’ while we await a vaccine. The paper reports the findings from the first phase of an ongoing survey designed to identify the changing patterns in travel activity of Australian residents as a result of the stage 2 restrictions imposed by the Australian government. The main restrictions, in addition to social distancing of at least 1.5 m, are closure of entry to Australia (except residents returning), and closure of non-essential venues such as night clubs, restaurants, mass attendee sporting events, churches, weddings, and all social gatherings in any circumstance. With some employers encouraging working from home and others requiring it, in addition to job losses, and many children attending school online from home, the implications on travel activity is extreme.
