Most importantly, acute exacerbation leads to an in-hospital mortality of more than 50% with a mean survival time of only a few months. Therefore, consideration of complications in IPF is of great importance for understanding the disease and treatment planning. Furthermore, the evidence for pneumological rehabilitation in IPF has greatly increased. This resulted in specific recommendations by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) for improvement in physical capacity, quality of life and symptom control.","Gläser, S.; Glöckl, R.; Bonella, F.",Pneumologe (Berl),461,5

Due to osmotic forces, MPT is paralleled by a massive influx of water into the mitochondrial matrix, eventually leading to the structural collapse of the organelle. Thus, MPT can initiate outer-mitochondrial-membrane permeabilization (MOMP), promoting the activation of the apoptotic caspase cascade and caspase-independent cell-death mechanisms. The induction of MPT is mostly dependent on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca(2+), but is also dependent on the metabolic stage of the affected cell and signaling events. Therefore, since its discovery in the late 1970s, the role of MPT in human pathology has been heavily investigated. Here, we summarize the most significant findings corroborating a role for MPT in the etiology of a spectrum of human diseases, including diseases characterized by acute or chronic loss of adult cells and those characterized by neoplastic initiation.","Bonora, Massimo; Patergnani, Simone; Ramaccini, Daniela; Morciano, Giampaolo; Pedriali, Gaia; Kahsay, Asrat Endrias; Bouhamida, Esmaa; Giorgi, Carlotta; Wieckowski, Mariusz R.; Pinton, Paolo",Biomolecules,461,22

Here, we describe a novel thiosulfate oxidation pathway discovered in the deep-sea cold seep bacterium Erythrobacter flavus 21–3, which provides a new clue about the formation of ZVS. Electronic microscopy, energy-dispersive, and Raman spectra were used to confirm that E. flavus 21–3 effectively converts thiosulfate to ZVS. We next used a combined proteomic and genetic method to identify thiosulfate dehydrogenase (TsdA) and thiosulfohydrolase (SoxB) playing key roles in the conversion of thiosulfate to ZVS. Stoichiometric results of different sulfur intermediates further clarify the function of TsdA in converting thiosulfate to tetrathionate ((−)O(3)S–S–S–SO(3)(−)), SoxB in liberating sulfone from tetrathionate to form ZVS and sulfur dioxygenases (SdoA/SdoB) in oxidizing ZVS to sulfite under some conditions. Notably, homologs of TsdA, SoxB, and SdoA/SdoB widely exist across the bacteria including in Erythrobacter species derived from different environments. This strongly indicates that this novel thiosulfate oxidation pathway might be frequently used by microbes and plays an important role in the biogeochemical sulfur cycle in nature.","Zhang, Jing; Liu, Rui; Xi, Shichuan; Cai, Ruining; Zhang, Xin; Sun, Chaomin",ISME J,461,1

Nonetheless, the roles of m6A regulators in childhood asthma remain unknown. In this study, 11 significant m6A regulators were selected using difference analysis between non-asthmatic and asthmatic patients from the Gene Expression Omnibus GSE40888 dataset. The random forest model was used to screen five candidate m6A regulators (fragile X mental retardation 1, KIAA1429, Wilm’s tumor 1-associated protein, YTH domain-containing 2, and zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein 13) to predict the risk of childhood asthma. A nomogram model was established based on the five candidate m6A regulators. Decision curve analysis indicated that patients could benefit from the nomogram model. The consensus clustering method was performed to differentiate children with asthma into two m6A patterns (clusterA and clusterB) based on the selected significant m6A regulators. Principal component analysis algorithms were constructed to calculate the m6A score for each sample to quantify the m6A patterns. The patients in clusterB had higher m6A scores than those in clusterA. Furthermore, we found that the patients in clusterA were linked to helper T cell type 1 (Th1)-dominant immunity while those in clusterB were linked to Th2-dominant immunity. In summary, m6A regulators play nonnegligible roles in the occurrence of childhood asthma. Our investigation of m6A patterns may be able to guide future immunotherapy strategies for childhood asthma.","Dai, Bing; Sun, Feifei; Cai, Xuxu; Li, Chunlu; Liu, Henan; Shang, Yunxiao",Front Genet,461,19

However, studies with a large sample size are needed to clarify their independent and combined risks for subsequent dementia. METHODS: This nationwide population-based cohort study included all individuals aged 66 years who participated in the National Screening Program between 2009 and 2013 (N = 939,099). Subjects were followed from the day they underwent screening to the diagnosis of dementia, death, or the last follow-up day (December 31, 2017). RESULTS: Depressive symptom presentation, recent depressive disorder, and SCD independently increased dementia incidence with adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.286 (95% CI:1.255–1.318), 1.697 (95% CI:1.621–1.776), and 1.748 (95% CI: 689–1.808) respectively. Subjects having both SCD and depression had a higher risk (aHR = 2.466, 95% CI:2.383–2.551) of dementia than having depression (aHR = 1.402, 95% CI:1.364–1.441) or SCD (aHR = 1.748, 95% CI:1.689–1.808) alone. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms, depressive disorder, and SCD are independent risk factors for dementia. Co-occurring depression and SCD have an additive effect on the risk of dementia; thus, early intervention and close follow up are necessary for patients with co-occurring SCD and depression.","Wang, Sheng-Min; Han, Kyung-do; Kim, Nak-Young; Um, Yoo Hyun; Kang, Dong-Woo; Na, Hae-Ran; Lee, Chang-Uk; Lim, Hyun Kook",PLoS One,461,22

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether GWLs can affect US smokers’ perceptions about their cigarettes or health consequences and changes in smoking behavior. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was a randomized clinical trial of the effect of a 3-month, real-world experience of cigarettes with GWL packaging. Community recruitment was done from September 2016 through December 2019 of daily smokers from San Diego, California, aged 21 to 65 years, who were not ready to quit. Participants were randomized to purchase and receive cigarettes in 1 of 3 pack designs: GWL, blank, or standard US pack. Data analysis was performed from July 2020 to February 2021. INTERVENTIONS: The study manufactured GWL cigarette packs (3 versions with Australian-licensed images) and packs devoid of marketing. For 3 months, participants purchased GWL, blank, or standard US pack cigarettes that were delivered to their home. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Smoking-related cognitions and behavior were queried by daily and weekly interactive text messages. Smoking behavior was self-reported before and after the intervention by 96% of randomized participants and was biochemically validated on a subsample. RESULTS: The study sample included 357 participants (195 women [54.6%]; mean [SD] age, 39.5 [11.9] years); 116 were randomized to the standard US pack group, 118 were randomized to the GWL pack group, and 125 were randomized to the blank pack group. Over the 3 months, participants who received the GWL packs had reduced positive perceptions of recent cigarettes smoked compared with participants who received the branded US pack (mean difference, −0.46 SD; 95% CI, −0.73 SD to −0.20 SD; P < .001). Health concerns increased in all groups, with a significant increase in the GWL group vs the US pack group (mean difference, 0.35 SD; 95% CI, 0.09 SD to 0.62 SD; P = .002). Quitting cognitions increased in all study groups, with a peak mean change of 0.60 SD for GWL participants vs 0.34 SD for US pack participants (mean difference, 0.55 SD; 95% CI, 0.28 SD to 0.81 SD; P < .001). GWL participants had slightly more cigarette abstinence periods per week than the US pack group, but the difference was not significant (adjusted odds ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.13). At 3 months, there was no between-group difference in any smoking behavior. The blank pack group was similar to the US pack group on all measures. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that the introduction of GWL packs appears to decrease positive perceptions of cigarettes and increase quitting cognitions in the short term. However, additional complementary tobacco control strategies may be necessary for GWL packs to be associated with reduced smoking behavior.

They are considered to provide high stability to the associated molecular cargoes because of encapsulation by the lipid bilayer, making them ideal for liquid biopsy and as a drug delivery system. Moreover, EVs can affect immunomodulatory functions, including antigen presentation and immune activation and suppression. Inhibiting the production of tumor-derived EVs can support tumor immunity, and immune cell-derived EVs can be used as an anticancer vaccine. This review summarizes the biological functions and isolation methods of EVs, and explores their diagnostic and therapeutic applications in lung cancer. ABSTRACT: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized lipid-bound particles containing proteins, nucleic acids and metabolites released by cells. They have been identified in body fluids including blood, saliva, sputum and pleural effusions. In tumors, EVs derived from cancer and immune cells mediate intercellular communication and exchange, and can affect immunomodulatory functions. In the context of lung cancer, emerging evidence implicates EV involvement during various stages of tumor development and progression, including angiogenesis, epithelial to mesenchymal transformation, immune system suppression, metastasis and drug resistance. Additionally, tumor-derived EVs (TDEs) have potential as a liquid biopsy source and as a means of therapeutic targeting, and there is considerable interest in developing clinical applications for EVs in these contexts. In this review, we consider the biogenesis, components, biological functions and isolation methods of EVs, and the implications for their clinical utility for diagnostic and therapeutic applications in lung cancer.","Kato, Taketo; Vykoukal, Jody V.; Fahrmann, Johannes F.; Hanash, Samir",Cancers (Basel),461,1

Our objective was to evaluate the association of TNF-α gene −308 G>A polymorphism with susceptibility to, and severity of, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). RESULTS: This was a cross-sectional study including 45 Egyptian children hospitalized for CAP in addition to 45 healthy children who served as a control group. Pneumonia severity was assessed on admission by the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines; Pediatric Respiratory Severity Score (PRESS) score; Predisposition, Infection, Response and Organ failure (PIROm) score; and Respiratory Index of Severity in Children (RISC) score. Genotyping of TNF-α polymorphism was performed to all individuals by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Patients were monitored till hospital discharge. Frequency of AG genotype was lower among patients compared with control [odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.13 (0.03–0.63); p = 0.012]. Prevalence of genotypes AA+AG was lower among patients compared with controls [OR and 95% CI = 0.34 (0.12–0.99); p = 0,048]. The “A” allele prevalence was higher among controls, but no significant association was found with CAP [OR and 95% CI = 0.58 (0.25–1.35); p = 0.21]. When PRESS score was used to classify patients into “severe pneumonia” and “non-severe pneumonia,” no significant association of any of the alleles or genotypes with CAP severity was found. CONCLUSION: TNF-α −308 G>A polymorphism confers protection from pediatric CAP but is not associated with indicators of CAP severity. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings in pediatric patients from different ethnicities.","El Gendy, Fady M.; El-Mekkawy, Muhammad Said; El-Naidany, Sherin Sobhy; El-torgoman, Shimaa Tarek",,461,19

Considering the main objective of the study, to assess the perception of security in Colombia, a questionnaire was carried out to identify the risks associated with this destination. To allow a comparison of the perception of safety with the Global Safety index, the responses of 206 potential tourists, 103 from Portugal and 103 from the Czech Republic, were selected. The results show that the destination Colombia is perceived as more dangerous by potential tourists than by actual tourists who have visited it and perceive it as much safer and more attractive.","Antošová, Gabriela; Lima Santos, Luís; Stradová, Sara","Advances in Tourism, Technology and Systems",461,1

We use a path‐dependency framework to understand the evolution of the Australian fashion industry and to evaluate the impact of COVID‐19 as an external shock to this evolution. The Australian fashion industry has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic. Drawing upon a qualitative methodology and associated set of methods consisting of 24 semi‐structured interviews with key industry actors, we explore three key themes. First, we examine the impact of COVID‐19 on firm dynamics, investigating how fashion brands have navigated a period of significant uncertainty through a combination of highly nimble internal business practices and industry collaborations. Second, in light of unstable globalised supply chains, we consider the important role of local garment production in supporting industrial resilience. Third, we explore how changing consumption behaviours are altering the retail geographies of the Australian fashion industry in both physical and virtual spaces.

However, as this new process can be cost and labour intensive, providing the clinic remotely has been proposed as a way of streamlining this service. This review aims to develop a Montgomery-compliant checklist that provides practical considerations on conducting a remote consent clinic, with scope to integrate this initially into orthopaedic practice. Two literature searches were conducted with the first establishing previous study in remote consent clinics and the second determining the feasibility and financial viability of providing a remote clinic against a face-to-face clinic. The initial analysis revealed remote consent clinics as a relatively novel area of research. However, both literature searches suggested improvements in both patient recall and understanding in remote consenting, further enhanced by additional resources. Moreover, remote clinics are more efficient and cost-effective while still maintaining high patient satisfaction; outcomes are further improved by delegating this service to alternative staff members. Patients also benefit from the complete erasure of travel times and associated costs. Additionally, in the era of COVID-19, it limits patient exposure allowing hospitals to provide safer services. Consent clinics, when performed remotely, are a cost-effective and efficient tool to minimise negligence claims while maximising patient satisfaction. In line with the digitisation of healthcare, it also allows for a COVID-appropriate service.

Although various research on the topic exists, such as contributors to food insecurity, and implications for individual physical and mental health outcomes; there is currently a lack of consideration as to how individual implications of food insecurity such as poor physical and mental health can consequently impact on business and the wider economy. In addition, there is a lack of conceptual literature related to food insecurity. Stakeholder interviews (n = 19) were conducted, and data were used to inform the conceptual model (risk factors, potential implications for individuals, the economy and business, and opportunities for business and policy response). The main suggested implications related to business and the economy were reduced contribution to the workforce and the economy, and increased cost pressures on the National Health Service. Business responses suggested included the inclusion of initiatives to address food insecurity in corporate social responsibility strategies, and further involvement of food businesses/retailers in redistributing surplus food. Policy responses suggested included policies relating to welfare, wages and work contracts, food redistribution incentives, sustainability, and community interventions in disadvantaged areas. The resulting model is unique in conceptualising food insecurity in the Northern Ireland context, with applicability to the UK and other developed nations.","Beacom, Emma; Furey, Sinéad; Hollywood, Lynsey; Humphreys, Paul",SN Bus Econ,461,25

COVID-19 had affected all age groups in both previously healthy individuals and those with chronic disease including IBD. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence and factors associated with psychosocioeconomical and medical changes in patients with IBD during the COVID-19 pandemic and post-pandemicperiod in China. METHODS: The survey questionnaires were sent to the patients with IBD in China including epicentres and outside. Bivariate analyses and logistic regression models were used to analysis associations between IBD and various demographic, disease factors, and patient-reported outcomes including working conditions, income, anxiety, stress, and sadness. RESULTS: Of the 2277 respondents, 144 (6.3%) respondents were from Hubei province which was the epicenter of COVID-19 in China. Multivariable regression demonstrated that patients had part-time work (odds ratio [OR]: 4.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.48-7.36; P<0.001) or those had middle education level (high school graduate and bachelor’s degree) (OR:7.28; 95%CI: 3.58-14.81; P<0.001) were more likely to have reduced income compared with those had full-time work or less than high school education level. In addition, female (OR: 1.41; 95%CI: 1.16-1.71; P= 0.01) patients were at higher risk of having an anxiety, stress and sadness disorder. While un-married patients (OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.63-0.91; P=0.003) patients were less likely to have mood changes. Moreover, IBD patients with active disease (OR: 4.79; 95% CI: 3.87-5.91; P<0.001) were at higher risk of IBD medication changes. CONCLUSION: The results from this large survey demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the patients with IBD financially, psychosocially, and medically. Our findings highlighted the importance of screening for psychosocioeconomic and medical changes in patients with IBD, with particular attention to those of female sex, have part-time work, and active disease. Our IBD community needs to develop effective and feasible strategies to deal with current and future challenges such as a viral pandemic.","Hu, S; Wang, X; Shen, B; Yu, Q; Zheng, J J; Chen, Y",J Crohns Colitis,461,1

Two common classifications of entrepreneurship types are based on professional status and start-up motive, where independent own-account workers are assumed to perform better than dependent self-employed and opportunity entrepreneurs are assumed to perform better than necessity entrepreneurs. However, these supposed performance differentials are seldomly tested or quantified. Using recent data drawn from the European Working Conditions Survey for the EU-28, we explore self-employment earnings (as an indicator of performance) across these different entrepreneurship types. Our results from OLS and multilevel linear regressions show that dependent self-employed workers are indeed observed to have significantly lower earnings than independent own-account workers, but the difference is only 10%, suggesting that the precarious nature of the dependent self-employed may be overstated in certain policy circles. Regarding start-up motive, our paper highlights the importance of distinguishing the group of entrepreneurs who simultaneously have both opportunity and necessity motives to start a business.","van Stel, André; Barrientos-Marín, Jorge; Caçador-Rodrigues, Leonel; Millán, Ana; Millán, José María",Int Entrep Manag J,461,1

We assess this question by analyzing emerging market decisions to tighten restrictions on capital outflows. While policymakers should be more likely to tighten restrictions to protect their economies as capital flow volatility (CFV) increases, investors view outflow controls as heterodox policies that violate investment contracts. We argue that the effect of CFV on outflow controls depends on the use of controls in peer markets. When peers are open, governments anticipate that controls will come at a high cost to their market reputations as heterodox measures send a negative signal to investors among a crowd of liberal peers. Conversely, when peers are closed, using controls should do less damage to an economy’s reputation. For 25 emerging markets from 1995–2015, we show that CFV is associated with outflow controls, but only when market peers are already closed, suggesting reputational concerns can limit policy autonomy.

Antimicrobial stewardship has been acknowledged as a primary strategy to tackle AMR. An important first step for antimicrobial stewardship is to quantify antimicrobial use (AMU). In Fiji, there are currently no data on AMU in livestock farms. This study aimed to quantify AMU in different livestock enterprises (beef, dairy, broiler, and layer) and farming systems (backyard, semi-commercial and commercial) in Central and Western divisions of Viti Levu, Fiji. A survey with 210 livestock farmers and 26 managers representing 276 enterprises was conducted between May and September 2019. The difference in AMU between different livestock enterprises and farming systems was investigated using ANOVA. In Fiji, the estimated annual antibiotic use in livestock was lower than the global average (44 compared with 118 mg/PCU). However, this use was concentrated in 56% of participant farms (the remaining 44% did not use antimicrobials). Total estimated quarterly anthelmintic use (20,797 mg) was not affected by farming systems but was highest (P < 0.001) in dairy enterprises (24,120 mg) and lowest in broiler enterprises (4 mg). Quarterly antibiotic use was different between the enterprises regardless of the metrics used to quantify the use (P < 0.05). Total estimated quarterly mg/PCU of antibiotic use was highest (P < 0.001) in broiler enterprises (12.4 mg/PCU) and lowest in beef enterprises (0.2 mg/PCU). For all other ESVAC metrics, total estimated antibiotic use was higher in poultry and lower in cattle enterprises. Backyard systems used less antibiotics (total mg) than commercial systems, but for other metrics, the trend was reversed. The use of both antibiotics and anthelmintics (rather than antibiotics or anthelmintics alone, or no AMU) was associated with dairy enterprises (Χ(2) = 123, P < 0.001). Further studies should be conducted to quantify and evaluate the drivers of AMU in Fijian livestock farms. In addition, differences in AMU between different enterprises and farming systems suggest that strategies to reduce AMU should be tailored to specific settings.","Khan, X.; Rymer, C.; Ray, P.; Lim, R.",One Health,461,28

Metabolic surgical procedures have been shown to improve diabetes, but the mechanism of action is poorly understood. The Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rodent is a type 2 diabetic animal model that is ideally situated for studying the effect of surgery on diabetes; however, the operative mortality is high. The aim of this study was to describe the operative technique, improvements in perioperative management, and the technique of micro-positron emission tomography (PET) scanning of the beta-cell mass in GK rodents. METHODS A total of 53 GK rats were divided into 1 of 3 operative groups: sham, sleeve gastrectomy, and duodenojejunal bypass. A subset of animals underwent micro-PET scanning with [11C]-dihydrotetrabenazine to determine the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 binding index, an indicator of beta-cell mass. RESULTS The 30-day mortality in the sham and sleeve gastrectomy rodents was 0; however, 2 sleeve gastrectomy rodents developed enterocutaneous fistula and 1 developed an abscess. In the duodenojejunal bypass group, the initial mortality rate was close to 90%; however, refinements in the surgical technique and perioperative management (fluids, antibiotics, pain control) lowered the mortality rate to 60%. The surgical technique is discussed in detail. [11C]-Dihydrotetrabenazine uptake in the pancreas was demonstrated on micro-PET scanning in the sham and duodenojejunal bypass rodents. CONCLUSION Intensive medical management in the perioperative period and attention to the operative technique lowered the mortality. [11C]-Dihydrotetrabenazine micro-PET scanning is a feasible method for assessing the beta-cell mass in GK rodents and could prove to be an important modality for evaluating beta-cell performance in type 2 diabetes.","Inabnet, William B; Milone, Luca; Korner, Judith; Durak, Evren; Ahmed, Leaque; Pomrantz, Jill; Harris, Paul E; Bessler, Marc",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,461,31

However, the improvement in overall survival is modest and only in combination with chemotherapy. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify potential underlying mechanisms of resistance specific to antiangiogenic therapy and develop strategies to overcome them. Here we found that anti-VEGFR2 therapy up-regulates both C-X-C chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) and C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) in orthotopic murine CRC models, including SL4 and CT26. Blockade of CXCR4 signaling significantly enhanced treatment efficacy of anti-VEGFR2 treatment in both CRC models. CXCR4 was predominantly expressed in immunosuppressive innate immune cells, which are recruited to CRCs upon anti-VEGFR2 treatment. Blockade of CXCR4 abrogated the recruitment of these innate immune cells. Importantly, these myeloid cells were mostly Ly6Clow monocytes and not Ly6Chigh monocytes. To selectively deplete individual innate immune cell populations, we targeted key pathways in Ly6Clow monocytes (Cx3cr1-/- mice), Ly6Chigh monocytes (CCR2-/- mice), and neutrophils (anti-Ly6G antibody) in combination with CXCR4 blockade in SL4 CRCs. Depletion of Ly6Clow monocytes or neutrophils improved anti-VEGFR2-induced SL4 tumor growth delay similar to the CXCR4 blockade. In CT26 CRCs, highly resistant to anti-VEGFR2 therapy, CXCR4 blockade enhanced anti-VEGFR2-induced tumor growth delay but specific depletion of Ly6G+ neutrophils did not. The discovery of CXCR4-dependent recruitment of Ly6Clow monocytes in tumors unveiled a heretofore unknown mechanism of resistance to anti-VEGF therapies. Our findings also provide a rapidly translatable strategy to enhance the outcome of anti-VEGF cancer therapies.","Jung, Keehoon; Heishi, Takahiro; Incio, Joao; Huang, Yuhui; Beech, Elizabeth Y; Pinter, Matthias; Ho, William W; Kawaguchi, Kosuke; Rahbari, Nuh N; Chung, Euiheon; Kim, Jun Ki; Clark, Jeffrey W; Willett, Christopher G; Yun, Seok Hyun; Luster, Andrew D; Padera, Timothy P; Jain, Rakesh K; Fukumura, Dai",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,461,24

We compared characteristics and outcomes of delirious and nondelirious patients enrolled in a multicenter trial comparing protocolized sedation with protocolized sedation plus daily sedation interruption. DESIGN Randomized trial. SETTING Sixteen North American medical and surgical ICUs. PATIENTS Four hundred thirty critically ill, mechanically ventilated adults. INTERVENTIONS All patients had hourly titration of opioid and benzodiazepine infusions using a validated sedation scale. For patients in the interruption group, infusions were resumed, if indicated, at half of previous doses. Delirium screening occurred daily; positive screening was defined as an Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist score of 4 or more at any time. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Delirium was diagnosed in 226 of 420 assessed patients (53.8%). Coma was identified in 32.7% of delirious compared with 22.7% of nondelirious patients (p = 0.03). The median time to onset of delirium was 3.5 days (interquartile range, 2-7), and the median duration of delirium was 2 days (interquartile range, 1-4). Delirious patients were more likely to be male (61.1% vs 46.6%; p = 0.005), have a surgical/trauma diagnosis (21.2% vs 11.0%; p = 0.030), and history of tobacco (31.5% vs 16.2%; p = 0.002) or alcohol use (34.6% vs 20.9%; p = 0.009). Patients with positive delirium screening had longer duration of ventilation (13 vs 7 d; p < 0.001), ICU stay (12 vs 8 d; p < 0.0001), and hospital stay (24 vs 15 d; p < 0.0001). Delirious patients were more likely to be physically restrained (86.3% vs 76.7%; p = 0.014) and undergo tracheostomy (34.6% vs 15.5%; p < 0.0001).

The sample of throat and pharyngeal swab were collected from each patient.11 types of virus including influenza A (FluA), influenza B (FluB), adenovirus (ADV), human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus type 1, type 2, type 3 (HPIV1, HPIV2, HPIV3), human metapneumovirus (MPV) and human coronavirus (HCoV) type 229E, type OC43 were detected by Fluorescence Quota PCR method. The epidemic feature and clinical characteristic of each virus were then analyzed. RESULTS Virus were found in 1024 samples in total, accounting for 65.9% (1024/1554). RSV was the most common virus, which was found in 261 samples (16.8%); and followed by HRV as 13.9% (216/1554), FluA as 11.6% (181/1554), MPV as 6.5% (101/1554), FluB as 6.4% (99/1554), HPIV as 4.9% (76/1554), ADV as 3.5% (55/1554) and HCoV as 2.3% (35/1554). HPIV and HCoV shared a similar infection ratio among different age groups. The infection ratio of FluA and FluB was highest among 15-24 years old group, accounting for 16.5% (29/176) and 7.4% (13/176) respectively.

The infection ratio of ADV was 6.0% (19/318), which was the most common pathogen among 5-14 years old patients. The incidence rate of HPIV and HRV showed no obvious seasonal features; while the prevalence of FluA, FluB, RSV, ADV, MPV and HCoV changed significantly in different seasons.22.2% (227/1024) ARI patients co-infected other respiratory virus.90.1% (163/181) FluA patients, 88.9% (88/99) FluB patients and 92.7% (51/55) ADV patients had high fever symptoms. CONCLUSION RSV was the main pathogen of ARI, and the new-found virus MPV was also another crucial pathogen. Some pathogens' incidence rate were related to the season and patient's age.

This procedure can result in tissue shrinkage, with the amount of shrinkage related to tissue composition and tissue type. AIMS To evaluate the shrinkage of nasal mucosa and cartilage tissue and compare differences in shrinkage after resection, after formalin fixation, and during microscopic examination to understand differences in the rate of shrinkage of different tissue types. STUDY DESIGN Animal experimentation. METHODS Fresh nasal septa were excised from sheep (10 mm diameter in 40 sheep and 20 mm diameter in 40 sheep). The mucosa was separated from one side of the cartilage, with the contralateral mucosa remaining attached to the cartilage. Specimen diameters were measured in situ, after resection, after fixation for 6 or 24 hours (10% formalin), and during microscopic examination. RESULTS There were no differences between the in situ and after resection diameters of any tissue components (free mucosa, mucosa attached to cartilage, and cartilage) of all nasal specimens (10- or 20-mm diameter and 6- or 24-hour fixation). However, significant shrinkage occurred between resection and after-fixation. Regarding tissue specimens that were fixed for different durations (6 or 24 hours), we observed a significantly smaller mean tissue diameter in specimens fixed for 24 hours versus those fixed for 6 hours for mucosa attached to cartilage (in the 10-mm diameter after-fixation samples), free mucosa (in the 20-mm diameter after-fixation samples), mucosa attached to cartilage (in the 20-mm diameter after-fixation and microscopic measurement samples), and cartilage (in the 20-mm diameter after-fixation samples). Tissue shrinkage was greatest in free mucosal tissue and least in cartilage. CONCLUSION These results should be considered when evaluating patients undergoing surgical procedures for nasal cavity and paranasal sinus malignancies. Surgical margins should be measured before fixation or evaluated if possible before fixation and shrinkage.","Kansu, Leyla; Aydın, Erdinç; Akkaya, Hampar; Avcı, Suat; Akalın, Nalan",Balkan medical journal,461,16

We collected tweets related to dental care needs of individuals exposed to the COVID-19 outbreak scenario between March 23 to May 4, 2020 and of those not exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic (unexposed group) on the same reported days of 2019 using the terms ""dentista (dentist), dente (tooth), siso (third molar), and aparelho (orthodontic appliance)."" Descriptive analysis was performed to provide summary statistics of the frequencies of tweets related to different dental treatment needs and also the differences in volume content between the years 2019 and 2020. Moreover, the data were analyzed by qualitative analysis using an inductive approach. A total of 1,763 tweets from 2020 and 1,339 tweets from 2019 were screened. Those tweets posted by non-Brazilian users, duplicates, and those unrelated to dental treatment needs were removed and, therefore 1,197 tweets from 2020 and 719 tweets from 2019 were selected. Content volume related to dental treatment needs greatly increased during the COVID-19 outbreak. Findings from the word cloud and content analysis suggest that dental pain, related or not to the third molar, and problems with orthodontic appliances were the topics most commonly related to dental treatment needs discussed during the COVID-19 outbreak, mainly conveying anxiety and distress. The volume of tweets related to dental treatment needs posted by Brazilian users increased during the COVID-19 outbreak and self-reported pain and urgencies were the most popular topics.","Oliveira, Leandro Machado; Zanatta, Fabrício Batistin",Brazilian oral research,461,1

Inducing host translation shutoff is a strategy used by many viruses to optimize their replication and spread. Here, we demonstrate that PRRSV infection causes host translation suppression, which is strongly dependent on viral replication. By screening PRRSV-encoded nonstructural proteins (nsps), we found that nsp2 participates in the induction of host translation shutoff and that its transmembrane (TM) domain is required for this process. nsp2-induced translation suppression is independent of protein degradation pathways and the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). However, the overexpression of nsp2 or its TM domain significantly attenuated the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, an alternative pathway for modulating host gene expression. PRRSV infection also attenuated the mTOR signaling pathway, and PRRSV-induced host translation shutoff could be partly reversed when the attenuated mTOR phosphorylation was reactivated by an activator of the mTOR pathway. PRRSV infection still negatively regulated the host translation when the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation were completely reversed. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PRRSV infection induces host translation shutoff and that nsp2 is associated with this process. Both eIF2α phosphorylation and the attenuation of the mTOR signaling pathway contribute to PRRSV-induced host translation arrest.IMPORTANCE Viruses are obligate parasites, and the production of progeny viruses relies strictly on the host translation machinery. Therefore, the efficient modulation of host mRNA translation benefits viral replication, spread, and evolution. In this study, we provide evidence that porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection induces host translation shutoff and that the viral nonstructural protein nsp2 is associated with this process. Many viruses induce host translation shutoff by phosphorylating eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). However, PRRSV nsp2 does not induce eIF2α phosphorylation but attenuates the mTOR signaling pathway, another pathway regulating the host cell translational machinery. We also found that PRRSV-induced host translation shutoff was partly reversed by eliminating the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation or reactivating the mTOR pathway, indicating that PRRSV infection induces both eIF2α phosphorylation-dependent and -independent host translation shutoff.","Li, Yang; Fang, Liurong; Zhou, Yanrong; Tao, Ran; Wang, Dang; Xiao, Shaobo",Journal of virology,461,31

Innovative gene expression-based approaches promise to deliver precise, fast, and clinically practicable diagnostic tools to bedside. This study aimed to validate the SepsisMetaScore, an 11-gene signature previously reported by our study group, in a representative longitudinal cohort of trauma patients. DESIGN Prospective observational cohort study. SETTING Surgical ICUs of the University Medical Center Goettingen, Germany. PATIENTS Critically ill patients with severe traumatic injuries. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Paired box gene (PAXgene) RNA blood tubes were drawn at predefined time points over the course of disease. The performance of the SepsisMetaScore was tested using targeted polymerase chain reaction and compared with Procalcitonin using area under the receiver operating characteristics analyses. The SepsisMetaScore showed significant differences between infected and noninfected patients (n = 52). It was able to accurately discriminate infectious from noninfectious acute inflammation with an area under the receiver operating characteristics of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.85-0.99) and significantly outperformed Procalcitonin (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.42-0.64) early in the course of infection (p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated the clinical utility for diagnosis of infections with higher accuracy using the SepsisMetaScore compared with Procalcitonin in a prospective cohort of severe trauma patients. Future studies should assess whether the SepsisMetaScore may substantially improve clinical practice by accurate differentiation of infections from sterile inflammation and identification of patients at risk for sepsis. Our results support further investigation of the SepsisMetaScore for the development of tailored precision treatment of critically ill patients.","Thair, Simone; Mewes, Caspar; Hinz, José; Bergmann, Ingo; Büttner, Benedikt; Sehmisch, Stephan; Meissner, Konrad; Quintel, Michael; Sweeney, Timothy E; Khatri, Purvesh; Mansur, Ashham",Critical care medicine,461,13

The pollution level of six organophosphorus pesticides, three herbicides, and one bactericide in groundwater and the Wenyu River, and their fates in three sewage treatment plants (STPs) and a hospital were investigated in this study. The concentrations of the ten detected pesticides ranged from not detected (ND) to 323.44 ng L-1 in different water samples from Beijing; metalaxyl was detected to have the highest concentration (89.58 ng L-1), and the detection frequencies of atrazine and metalaxyl were 100%. The maximum concentrations of pesticides in the Wenyu River, STPs, and the hospital were 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than those in the groundwater. Good removal efficiencies by the treatment processes were observed for ametryn (100%), while the removal efficiencies for atrazine and omethoate were the lowest in the three STPs (- 9.6% and 12.67%, respectively). Finally, risk quotient (RQ) values of each contaminant were estimated from the maximum values determined for typical urban to assess the ecology and health effects. In the case of environmental toxicity, the highest RQ values (> 1) were obtained for dichlorvos and omethoate. In the case of health toxicity, the RQ values show that the pesticides found in groundwater pose no potential health risks to humans at current concentrations.","Zhang, Yaru; Qin, Pan; Lu, Shaoyong; Liu, Xianbin; Zhai, Jun; Xu, Jiamin; Wang, Yongqiang; Zhang, Guodong; Liu, Xiaohui; Wan, Zhengfen",Environmental science and pollution research international,461,1

For example, high incidence and density of the Y1 subtype of neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptors are found in breast tumors. Recently, we demonstrated that the use of potent radiolabeled somatostatin or bombesin receptor antagonists considerably improved the sensitivity of in vivo imaging when compared to agonists. We report here on the first DOTA-coupled peptidic Y1 receptor affine dimer antagonists. METHODS Based on a Y1 affine dimeric peptide scaffold previously reported to competitively antagonize NPY-mediated processes, we have developed new dimeric DOTA-coupled Y1 receptor affine antagonists for scintigraphy and radiotherapy. These dimeric peptides were tested for their specific binding to Y1 expressed in SK-N-MC cells and Y2 expressed in SH-SY5Y as well as for their ability to mediate cAMP production in SK-N-MC cells. RESULTS Introduction of two DOTA moieties at the N-termini of the dimeric NPY analogs as well as the double Asn29 replacement by Dpr(DOTA) or Lys(DOTA) (6 and 10) moiety dramatically reduced binding affinity. However, asymmetric introduction of the DOTA moiety in one segment of the peptidic heterodimer (8 and 11) resulted in suitable antagonists for receptor targeting with high binding affinity for Y1. All compounds were devoid of Y2 binding affinity. CONCLUSIONS The design and the in vitro characterization of the first DOTA-coupled dimeric NPY receptor antagonist with high affinity and selectivity for Y1 over Y2 are described. This compound may be an excellent candidate for the imaging of Y1-positive tumors and their treatment.","Chatenet, David; Cescato, Renzo; Waser, Beatrice; Erchegyi, Judit; Rivier, Jean E; Reubi, Jean Claude",EJNMMI research,461,16

However, patients who need re-operation for this complication have a high rate of postoperative complications. We report a case series of three patients who underwent fluoroscopic balloon dilation (FBD) for early jejunojejunostomy obstruction (JJO) after gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction (R-Y reconstruction). CASE PRESENTATION Three patients were referred to our hospital for surgery for gastric cancer. Robot-assisted distal gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection and antecolic R-Y reconstruction were performed in two patients, and robot-assisted total gastrectomy with D1+ lymph node dissection and antecolic R-Y reconstruction was performed in one patient. The jejunojejunostomy was created as a side-to-side anastomosis using a linear 45-mm stapler. The entry hole was closed with a knotless barbed suture, and serosal-muscle layer suture reinforcement with an absorbable suture was performed at the jejunojejunostomy. Subsequently, all the patients were diagnosed with JJO by computed tomography and upper gastrointestinal series. The average time to JJO from gastrectomy was 5 days (range 2-7); initial clinical symptoms were vomiting in all three cases, with simultaneous upper abdominal pain in one case. We successfully performed FBD in all three cases after unsuccessful conservative treatment using an ileus tube. The clinical symptoms improved soon after FBD, and all the patients were able to avoid re-operation. The average period to FBD from JJO was 10 days (range 4-14). The average procedure time was 46 min (range 29-68), and the average duration to oral intake from FBD was 4 days (range 2-5). The average duration of hospital stay after FBD was 12 days (range 9-15). There were no complications in any of the cases. CONCLUSION FBD might be a feasible procedure to avoid surgery for early small bowel obstruction after gastrectomy with R-Y reconstruction.","Kamada, Teppei; Ohdaira, Hironori; Hoshimoto, Sojun; Narihiro, Satoshi; Suzuki, Norihiko; Marukuchi, Rui; Takeuchi, Hideyuki; Yoshida, Masashi; Yamanouchi, Eigoro; Suzuki, Yutaka",Surgical case reports,461,1

Thiol/disulfide homeostasis balance parameters were measured using a novel automatic and spectrophotometric method and compared statistically. Serum total thiol (TT), native thiol (SH), disulphide (SS), disulphide/native thiol (SS/SH), disulphide/total thiol (SS/TT), and native thiol/total thiol (SH/TT) ratios were measured after the second month of the treatment. RESULTS The 35 patients included 20 (58%) females and 15 (42%) males. The mean age of the patients was 33.17 ± 9.9 years. Disulphide, SS/SH, and SS/TT ratios decreased significantly after the treatment (P < .05), while SH and SH/TT increased significantly (P < .05).

We aimed to assess whether active learning strategies increase after implementing a faculty development workshop and transitioning rheumatology fellowship didactics to a virtual flipped classroom. METHODS We measured baseline faculty use of active learning strategies during lectures within the Introductory Rheumatology Curriculum by calculating an ""active learning score"" from a cognitive learning theory assessment tool. We held a faculty development workshop demonstrating active teaching strategies and encouraged using a flipped classroom for fellowship didactics. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the strategies were discussed in a virtual classroom setting, where the intervention phase would occur. We compared active learning scores before and after the intervention for lectures within the Introductory Rheumatology Curriculum. The primary outcome was the change in active teaching scores pre- versus post-intervention. RESULTS Active learning scores increased in 14 out of the 16 lectures, with a mean score increase of 4.7 out of 24 points (95% CI 2.3-7.2). Paired T-test analyses comparing active learning scores pre-and post-intervention for each lecture confirmed that results were highly statistically significant (p < 0.001). Despite faculty hesitancy to teach within a virtual environment, faculty satisfaction remained high post-intervention.

SAMPLE POPULATION 28 canine cadavers. PROCEDURES Thoracostomy tube placement techniques (7 cadavers/technique) included subcutaneous tunneling with a silicone tube by use of Carmalt forceps or with a polyvinyl chloride tube by use of a trocar (SC-CARM and SC-TRO, respectively) and tunneling under the latissimus dorsi muscle with similar tube-instrument techniques (LD-CARM and LD-TRO, respectively). Differences in intrapleural pressures (IPPs) measured before and after tube placement and before and after tube removal were calculated; duration of air leakage around the tubes was assessed by use of a 3-chamber thoracic drainage system. RESULTS Tunneling method and depth had no interaction effect on the difference in IPP measured before and after tube placement; the IPP difference for both forceps technique groups was significantly greater than findings for both trocar technique groups. Tunneling method and depth had an interaction effect on the difference in IPP measured before and after tube removal; compared with SC-TRO and LD-CARM group differences, the SC-CARM group difference was significantly greater, but the LD-TRO group difference was similar. More intermittent air leakage was associated with the 2 forceps techniques than with the 2 trocar techniques. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Trocar-implemented thoracostomy tube placement in canine cadavers resulted in less air leakage than the forceps method. Air leakage upon tube removal was less pronounced for the LD-CARM technique than the SC-CARM technique.

Studies using DOACs in cancer patients include few with myeloma. The aim of this feasibility clinical trial was to establish the foundations for creating a multicentre trial and identify any safety concerns with apixaban. Patient perspectives were sought. NDMM patients were stratified according to VTE risk and randomised to either standard TP or apixaban 2.5 mg BD and reviewed every 3 weeks throughout their chemotherapy. Two focus groups were carried out on 2 occasions at King's College Hospital and Guy's Hospital, London. Each lasted an hour, were recorded, transcribed and themes explored using NVivo 11. Ten patients were recruited, 2 considered high risk and received apixaban and 8 standard risk; 4 randomised to aspirin and 4 to apixaban. Five patients and 2 carers participated in the focus groups. There were no major bleeding or VTE events. Patients were not aware of the thrombotic risk associated with cancer. There is a lack of both written and verbal information on this topic. Myeloma patients were happy to be included in more than one trial simultaneously. Our study provides information on the difficulties facing physicians and patients on obtaining evidence of the safety of DOACs in the context of myeloma.

The delivery, organization, and financing of the health care system has evolved over time due to technological innovation, policy changes, patient preferences, altering payment mechanisms, shifting demographics, and other factors. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to examine trends over time in health care utilization and expenditures in the United States. RESEARCH DESIGN This analysis employs descriptive statistics to examine 5 decades of health care utilization and expenditure data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) for 1977-2017. MEASURES Measures include utilization and expenditures (not charges) for inpatient, emergency department, outpatient physician, outpatient nonphysician, office-based physician, dental, and out-of-pocket retail prescription drugs. RESULTS We demonstrate that while health care expenditures have increased significantly overall and by type of care, utilization trends are less pronounced. The population of the United States grew 53% between 1977 and 2017, while annual total expenditures on health care increased by 208%. Amidst attention to out-of-pocket exposure for unexpected medical care bills, out-of-pocket payments for care have declined from 32% in 1977 to 12% in 2017 but increased in amount. CONCLUSIONS This article provides the first extended snapshot of the dynamics of health care utilization and expenditures in the United States. Aspects of health care are much different today than in previous decades, yet the inpatient setting still dominates the expenditures.","Mortensen, Karoline; Dean, Emma Boswell; French, Michael T; Wang, Nianyang; Chen, Jie",Medical care,461,31

In a state of septic shock complicated by limb ischemia, surgical interventions are necessary to control the pathological cascade and improve patient outcomes. The objective of this article was to report etiologies and surgical outcomes associated with cutaneous manifestations in adults. Methods This systematic review and meta-analysis compared 190 adult patients with etiologies, signs and symptoms, and surgical outcomes associated with cutaneous manifestations of PF. The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were systematically and independently searched. Patient and clinical characteristics, surgical interventions, outcomes, and complications were recorded. Results Seventy-nine studies were eligible for the systematic review, and 77 were eligible for meta-analysis using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) and Cochrane guidelines. A total of 71/190 (38%) cases reported surgical debridement. Fasciotomies were reported in 12/190 (6%) cases and 20 procedures. Amputations were reported in 154/190 (81%) cases. Reconstruction was reported in 45 cases. Skin grafts were applied in 31 cases. Flaps were used for reconstruction in 28 cases. Median (IQR) surgical procedures per patient were 4 (4, 5) procedures. Infectious organisms causing PF were 32% Neisseria meningitidis (n = 55) and 32% Streptococcus pneumonia (n = 55). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (95% confidence interval (CI)(8.2-177.9), p = 0.032), Haemophilus influenza (95%CI (7.2-133), p = 0.029), Streptococcus pneumonia (95% CI (13.3-75.9), p = 0.006), and West Nile Virus (95%CI (8.2-177.9), p = 0.032) were associated with significantly more extensive amputations compared to other organisms. Conclusion This systematic review and patient-level meta-analysis found the most common presentation of PF was septic shock from an infectious organism. Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumonia were equally the most common organisms associated with PF. The majority of cases were not treated in a burn center. The most common surgeries were amputations, with below-the-knee-amputations being the most common procedure. Skin grafting was the most commonly performed reconstructive procedure. The most common complications were secondary infections. Organisms with significantly more extensive amputations were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Haemophilus influenza, Streptococcus pneumonia, and West Nile Virus. Interpretation of findings should be cautioned due to limited sample data.","Klifto, Kevin M; Gurno, Caresse F; Grzelak, Michael J; Seal, Stella M; Asif, Mohammed; Hultman, C Scott; Caffrey, Julie A",Burns & trauma,461,31

The infiltrated neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are associated with tissue damage. It is not known whether NETs are involved in the pathogenesis of one-lung injury and if they could be a potential therapeutic target. In the present study, we quantified NETs in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from pediatric patients who underwent OLV and assessed their relationship with prognosis. Methods Eighteen patients with congenital pulmonary cysts or pulmonary sequestration were enrolled in this prospective monocentric study. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels, NET markers [i.e., citrullinated histone-3 (CH-3) and free double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)], and inflammatory cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were assessed. Continuous variables were compared using the paired t-test. The association of NET concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and clinical parameters was assessed using linear regression analyses. Results dsDNA concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was higher after OLV than before OLV in both the affected lung (0.23±0.30 vs. 0.97±1.05, P<0.05) and the healthy lung (0.28±0.19 vs. 2.45±2.23, P<0.05). However, there were no significant differences in concentrations of MPO, CH-3, and inflammatory cytokines before and after OLV. Serum interleukin (IL)-6 concentration was higher after OLV than before (t=-3.222, P=0.007). Moreover, no associations between dsDNA concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and the duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation, postoperative hospital stay, and chest high-resolution computed tomography score were observed. The durations of OLV, anesthesia, and operation, as well as the amount of blood loss, had no significant influence on postoperative dsDNA concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Conclusions NETs in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid are not involved in patients who undergo OLV.","Xu, Yingyi; Lu, Bingtai; Zhang, Na; Liang, Yufeng; Gao, Ying; Ye, Xiaoxin; Liu, Wei",Translational pediatrics,461,1

Currently, there is observed an increasing interest in natural plant-derived substances as a potential and promising group of medicines in prevention and treatment of several infectious diseases. Terpenes and their derivatives are a large class of natural organic components of essential oils and are widespread in the plant kingdom. Numerous experimental studies have shown that essential oils exhibit a large spectrum of biological and pharmacological activities in vitro. Herbal essential oils have been proved to possess antimicrobial, antiviral, antifungal and antiparasitic properties. They have also been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory and immunostimulatory activities. Based on the wide spectrum of various biological activities, essential oils and terpenes commonly found in fruit, vegetables, herbs etc. have been suggested to constitute a novel group of preventive and therapeutic agents. Further experiments are necessary to confirm their pharmacological effectiveness, to determine potential toxic effects and the mechanism of their activity in in vivo models. This article describes the biological and pharmacological properties of herbal essential oils and some of their components, and summarizes the future prospects of potential application of essential oils in the prevention and treatment of infectious human diseases. In this review also possible mechanisms of their biological action are presented.","Król, Sylwia Katarzyna; Skalicka-Woźniak, Krystyna; Kandefer-Szerszeń, Martyna; Stepulak, Andrzej",Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej,461,28

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection induces severe lung inflammatory lesions in piglets, which is manifested as pulmonary endothelial dysfunction. However, the underlying mechanism of PRRSV affecting porcine pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMECs) remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the susceptibility of PMECs to PRRSV. Primary PMECs were isolated and purified from piglet lungs, and the expression of three PRRSV receptors was characterized using immunofluorescence. Overt cytopathic effects of the PRRSV strain HN in PMECs were observed at day five post-infection, and PRRSV antigens in PMECs were determined at both RNA and protein levels using immunofluorescence and quantitative RT-PCR assays. The viral antigen significantly increased at 96 hr post-infection, and infectious virus was recovered from the supernatant of the infected PMECs. The results show that PMECs can be infected with the PRRSV strain HN, and that their receptor expression pattern is different from that of alveolar macrophages. The results of this study shed light on the potential roles of PMECs in PRRSV infection and provide a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis underlying its severe manifestation.","Li, Peishan; Yang, Zhongjin; Ma, Shun; Hu, Ge; Dong, Hong; Zhang, Tao",The Journal of veterinary medical science,461,12

The trichomonad was identified as Tritrichomonas foetus, with a genotype that is distinct from venereal T foetus of cattle. Clinical challenges: Despite multiple means for diagnosis of the infection, including light microscopy, protozoal culture and PCR amplification using species-specific primers, tests with even greater sensitivity are needed. Feline trichomonosis is resistant to all commonly used antiprotozoal drugs. Ronidazole is currently the only drug demonstrated to be effective in eliminating the infection from cats; however, this drug has a narrow safety margin and clinical resistance is increasingly recognized. The more we learn about trichomonosis in cats, the more complicated and controversial the infection has become, ranging from what we should call the organism to whether we should even bother trying to treat it. Global importance: Feline trichomonosis is recognized to occur worldwide and is regarded as one of the most common infectious causes of colitis in the domestic cat. The infection is widespread in catteries and shelters; and, while remission of diarrhea may occur over time, persistence of the infection is common. Evidence base: This review provides a comprehensive examination of what is currently known about feline trichomonosis and pinpoints areas, based on the authors' opinion, where further research is needed.","Gookin, Jody L; Hanrahan, Katherine; Levy, Michael G",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,461,16

DESIGN Qualitative study involving key informant interviews. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Purposive sample of US public health practitioners, leaders, and academics expected to be knowledgeable about the report recommendations, public health practice, and changes in public health finance since the report. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Qualitative feedback about changes to public health finance since the report. RESULTS Thirty-two interviews were conducted between April and May 2019. The greatest momentum toward the report recommendations has occurred predominantly at the state and local levels, with recommendations requiring federal action making less progress. In addition, much of the progress identified is consensus building and preparation for change rather than clear changes. Overall, progress toward the recommendations has been slow. CONCLUSIONS Many of the achievements reported by respondents were characterized as increased dialogue and individual state or local progress rather than widespread, identifiable policy or practice changes. Participants suggested that public health as a field needs to achieve further consensus and a uniform voice in order to advocate for changes at a federal level. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE Slow progress in achieving 2012 IOM Finance Report recommendations and lack of a cohesive voice pose threats to the public's health, as can be seen in the context of COVID-19 emergency response activities. The pandemic and the nation's inadequate response have highlighted deficiencies in our current system and emphasize the need for coordinated and sustained core public health infrastructure funding at the federal level.","Yeager, Valerie A; Balio, Casey P; McCullough, J Mac; Leider, Jonathon P; Orr, Jason; Singh, Simone R; Bekemeier, Betty; Resnick, Beth",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,461,5

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted on children age 6 to 19 years who are diagnosed with T1DM, and examined the effect of adding Metformin to standard insulin therapy. We performed literature searches on Ovid Midline, Ovid Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from the date of inception of the database to February 15, 2016. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts independently, assessed full text eligibility, and extracted information from eligible trials. The primary outcome is glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and the secondary outcomes are health-related quality of life, body mass index (BMI), lipid profile, total insulin daily dose, hypoglycaemia, and diabetes ketoacidosis. We screened 736 studies, and included 6 RCTs with 325 patients. All RCTs were of low risk of bias, and included adolescents (mean age 15 years). The meta-analysis showed that the addition of Metformin resulted in decreased total insulin daily dose (TIDD) (unit/kg/d) (mean difference [MD] = -0.15, 95%CI, -0.24, -0.06), and reduced BMI kg/m2 (MD -1.46, 95%CI -2.54, 0.38), and BMI z-score (MD= - 0.11, 95%CI -0.21, -0.01), and similar HbA1c (%) (MD= - 0.05, 95%CI, -0.19, 0.29). The overall evidence quality was high to moderate. Current evidence does not support use of Metformin in T1DM adolescents to improve HbA1c.

We investigated whether hyperglycemia affected the outcomes of subjects treated with MT in the Solitaire Flow Restoration With the Intention for Thrombectomy (SWIFT) multicenter randomized trial, overall and according to reperfusion status after MT. METHODS We analyzed the relationships between the presenting glucose level as a continuous variable and presenting hyperglycemia (>140 mg/dL glucose) as a binary variable and several outcomes of interest. Subjects were stratified according to the completeness of reperfusion (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Ischemia scale 3 versus 0-2) after MT. Excellent outcome at 3 months was defined as a modified Rankin scale score of 0-1. RESULTS Among all patients undergoing MT, patients with hyperglycemia less frequently exhibited an excellent outcome at 3 months than patients without hyperglycemia, 13% versus 34%; P=0.01. Presenting glucose levels did not differ among patients achieving complete reperfusion and incomplete reperfusion. Among patients with incomplete reperfusion, after adjustment for covariates, higher glucose levels were independently associated with worse outcome at 3 months (per 10 mg/dL increase in glucose: odds ratio for modified Rankin scale score 0-1 at 3 months 0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.34-0.99; P=0.047). In contrast, among patients with complete reperfusion, differences in presenting glucose levels by final outcome did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS In patients treated with MT, hyperglycemia was independently associated with worse outcome at 3 months, and the negative effects of hyperglycemia may have been exacerbated in patients with incomplete reperfusion after MT.

Knowledge on the types and frequency of respiratory viruses affecting school-children is important in determining the role of schools in transmission in the community and identifying targets for interventions. Methods: We conducted a one-year (term-time) surveillance of respiratory viruses in a rural primary school in Kilifi County, coastal Kenya between May 2017 and April 2018. A sample of 60 students with symptoms of ARI were targeted for nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) collection weekly. Swabs were screened for 15 respiratory virus targets using real time PCR diagnostics. Data from respiratory virus surveillance at the local primary healthcare facility was used for comparison. Results: Overall, 469 students aged 2-19 years were followed up for 220 days. A total of 1726 samples were collected from 325 symptomatic students; median age of 7 years (IQR 5-11). At least one virus target was detected in 384 (22%) of the samples with a frequency of 288 (16.7%) for rhinovirus, 47 (2.7%) parainfluenza virus, 35 (2.0%) coronavirus, 15 (0.9%) adenovirus, 11 (0.6%) respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and 5 (0.3%) influenza virus. The proportion of virus positive samples was higher among lower grades compared to upper grades (25.9% vs 17.5% respectively; χ 2 = 17.2, P -value <0.001). Individual virus target frequencies did not differ by age, sex, grade, school term or class size. Rhinovirus was predominant in both the school and outpatient setting. Conclusion: Multiple respiratory viruses circulated in this rural school population. Rhinovirus was dominant in both the school and outpatient setting and RSV was of notably low frequency in the school. The role of school children in transmitting viruses to the household setting is still unclear and further studies linking molecular data to contact patterns between the school children and their households are required.","Adema, Irene Wangwa; Kamau, Everlyn; Uchi Nyiro, Joyce; Otieno, Grieven P; Lewa, Clement; Munywoki, Patrick K; Nokes, D James",Wellcome open research,461,1

Data along the TB cascade are recorded for all clients using the CommCare app. Cochran-Armitage χ2 test for linear trend was used to assess the significance declining trends along the TB cascade. Results There was a progressive decrease of respectively 63%, 64%, 73% and 72% in clinic attendance, presumptive TB identification, TB cases detected and treatment initiation for the TB Surge ACF intervention since the emergence of coronavirus; a similar decrease was noted for the WoW intervention. Trend analysis showed a significant decline in trends for both interventions for all variables (P < 0.001). Conclusion The COVID-19 epidemic has impacted negatively on TB services in Nigeria. The TB programme could leverage some resources used to combat the epidemic such as digital health technology and funds, and work towards strengthening patient-centred approach to care to limit the challenges that COVID-19 presents to TB control.","Odume, B; Falokun, V; Chukwuogo, O; Ogbudebe, C; Useni, S; Nwokoye, N; Aniwada, E; Olusola Faleye, B; Okekearu, I; Nongo, D; Odusote, T; Lawanson, A",Public health action,461,23

METHODS Sixty-five patients with NET underwent DOPA-cePET/CT. The DOPA-PET, multi-phase CT and combined DOPA cePET/CT data were evaluated and diagnostic accuracies compared. The value of ceCT in DOPA cePET/CT concerning lesion detection and therapeutic impact was evaluated. Sensitivities, specificities and accuracies were calculated. Histopathology and clinical follow-up served as the standard of reference. Differences were tested for statistical significance by McNemar's test. RESULTS In 40 patients metastatic and/or primary tumour lesions were detected. Lesion-based analysis for the DOPA-PET showed sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 66%, 100% and 67%, for the ceCT data 85%, 71% and 85%, and for the combined DOPA cePET/CT data 97%, 71% and 96%. DOPA cePET/CT was significantly more accurate compared with dual-phase CT (p < 0.05) and PET alone (p < 0.05). Additional lesion detection was based on ceCT in 12 patients; three patients underwent significant therapeutic changes based on the ceCT findings. CONCLUSION DOPA cePET/CT was significantly more accurate than DOPA-PET alone and ceCT alone. The CT component itself had a diagnostic impact in a small percentage but contributed to the therapeutic strategies in selected patients.","Veit-Haibach, Patrick; Schiesser, Marc; Soyka, Jan; Strobel, Klaus; Schaefer, Niklaus G; Hesselmann, Rolf; Clavien, P-A; Hany, Thomas F",European radiology,461,10

Previous studies with H. parasuis have revealed virulence disparity among isolates and inconsistent heterologous protection. In this study, virulence, direct transmission, and heterologous protection of 4 isolates of H. parasuis (SW114, 12939, MN-H, and 29755) were evaluated using a highly susceptible pig model. In an initial experiment, isolates 12939, MN-H, and 29755 caused Glässer's disease, while strain SW114 failed to cause any clinical signs of disease. One pig from each group challenged with MN-H or 29755 failed to develop clinical disease but was able to transmit H. parasuis to noninfected pigs, which subsequently developed Glässer's disease. Pigs colonized with SW114, 29755, or MN-H that were free of clinical disease were protected from a subsequent challenge with isolate 12939. In a following experiment, pigs vaccinated with strain SW114 given as either a bacterin intramuscularly or a live intranasal vaccine were protected from subsequent challenge with isolate 12939; however, some pigs given live SW114 developed arthritis. Overall these studies demonstrated that pigs infected with virulent isolates of H. parasuis can remain healthy and serve as reservoirs for transmission to naive pigs and that heterologous protection among H. parasuis isolates is possible. In addition, further attenuation of strain SW114 is necessary if it is to be used as a live vaccine.","Brockmeier, Susan L; Loving, Crystal L; Mullins, Michael A; Register, Karen B; Nicholson, Tracy L; Wiseman, Barry S; Baker, Rodney B; Kehrli, Marcus E",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,461,16

The frying process of soybean oil (SO) showed three obvious stages-break-in, optimum, and degrading. Further, in order to distinguish the key aroma compounds in each stage, the FFs prepared in SO with total polar compounds (TPC) of 6.5% (FF7), 16.37% (FF16), and 26.5% (FF27), and their corresponding oils (SO7, SO16, SO27) were chosen for sensory-directed analysis. In the break-in stage (6.50-13.50% of TPC), the flavor of the FFs was light and undesirable due to the lower content of (E,E)-2,4-decadienal. Then at the optimum stage (15.43-22.70% of TPC), the FFs obtained a higher sensory score, mainly owing to the increase of (E,E)-2,4-decadienal with a strong, deep-fried odor. However, in the degrading stage (over 22.70% of TPC), high level of four acids (hexanoic, heptanoic, octanoic, and nonanoic acid), benzeneacetaldehyde and trans-4,5-epoxy-(E)-2-decenal resulted in flavor deterioration in FF27.","Xu, Lirong; Mei, Xue; Chang, Jiarui; Wu, Gangcheng; Zhang, Hui; Jin, Qingzhe; Wang, Xingguo",Food chemistry,461,16

This was a retrospective study into potential ethnic disparity in the presentation and outcomes of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) between New Zealand (NZ) Polynesian and European patients. Data were analysed for patients treated at Auckland City Hospital (ACH; n = 55) and recorded in the New Zealand Cancer Registry (NZCR; n = 173), both for the period 2000-2017. We found that Polynesian patients treated at ACH presented at a younger age than European (P = 0.005), showed higher blast counts (P = 0.033), and a marginally higher prothrombin ratio (P = 0.02). Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) was started faster in Polynesian patients than European (P = 0.021), suggesting Polynesians were sicker at presentation but were managed accordingly. There were no differences in bleeding events, transfusion requirements and early deaths during the first month of treatment. Long-term survival was also similar. Data extracted from the NZCR confirmed NZ Polynesian patients with APL were younger than European (P < 0.001), but long-term survival was similar (P = 0.920). In summary, this study indicates a discrepancy in the presentation and severity of APL between NZ Polynesian and European patients but treatment initiation was rapid with no difference in outcomes. The distinctive features of APL in NZ Polynesians raise the possibility of a predisposing genetic factor or a different risk factor profile, elucidation of which is important for all patients with APL.","Varghese, Chris; Liu, Valery Yizhuo; Immanuel, Tracey; Chien, Nicole; Green, Taryn; Chan, George; Theakston, Edward; Kalev-Zylinska, Maggie",Hematology,461,16

Timely diagnosis of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) improves the survival of the patients and also prevents the transmission of the infection. In this study, we reviewed the applicable and available methods for the diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS For the review, we systematically searched Web of Science, PubMed, and Iranian articles that were published about COVID-19 diagnostic methods with a combination of the key terms: laboratory, radiological, tests, coronavirus. RESULTS Although the current gold standard diagnostic test for this virus is real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the occasional false-negative and the low sensitivity of the test should not be underestimated. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan is another diagnostic test for COVID-19, with higher sensitivity but low specificity. A combination of sensitive RT-PCR with a chest CT scan together with the clinical features are highly recommended for the proper diagnosis. Notably, there are some other sensitive and low-cost tests for evaluation of COVID-19 infection, but their validation should be approved. CONCLUSION Since early and accurate diagnosis of the viral disease could improve the survival rate of the patients, and halt the transmission chain, it is not surprising that tremendous attempts should be made to reduce the limitations of the tests leading to the false-negative results and to find a rapid test for the diagnosis of COVID-19.","Rafiee, Mohammad; Parsaei, Farahnaz; Rahimi Pordanjani, Sajjad; Amiri, Vahid; Sabour, Siamak",Archives of Iranian medicine,461,17

A shared responsibility.,17.762335,1.651651,2020,"BACKGROUND Cancer patients increasingly seek second opinion (SO) consultations, but there is scarce empirical evidence to substantiate medical and psychological benefits for patients. This is the first study to examine patient- and oncologist-reported (1) motivations and expectations of patients to seek a SO, (2) the perceived medical outcome, and (3) psychological consequences of SOs over time (i.e. patients' uncertainty and anxiety). MATERIAL AND METHODS This multi-informant longitudinal cohort study (SO-COM) included consecutive cancer patients referred for a SO (N = 70; age 28-85), as well as their referring and consulting oncologists. Outcome measures were completed at three time points: Patients and referring oncologists reported motivations and expectations before the SO (T0), patients and consulting oncologists reported the medical outcome of the SO (i.e. discrepancy between first and second opinion) immediately following the SO (T1), and patients reported their uncertainty and anxiety at T0, T1, and two months following the SO (T2). RESULTS Cancer patients most frequently reported wanting expert advice, exhausting all options, and/or needing more information as motivations for SOs. Referring oncologists rather accurately anticipated these motivations, except most did not recognize patients' information needs. The vast majority of patients (90.0%) received a medical advice similar to the first opinion, although 65.7% had expected to receive a different opinion. Patients' uncertainty (F = 6.82, p=.002; η2 =.22), but not anxiety (F = 3.074, p=.055, η2 =.11) was significantly reduced after the SO. CONCLUSIONS SOs can yield psychological benefits by reducing patients' uncertainty, but the added medical value remains debatable. Referring oncologists may not be fully aware of their patients' information needs. Patients should be better informed about goals and benefits of SOs to better manage their expectations. More cost-effective ways of optimally providing medically and psychologically valuable SOs need to be explored.","Lehmann, Vicky; Smets, Ellen M A; de Jong, Maxime; de Vos, Filip Y F; Kenter, Gemma G; Stouthard, Jacqueline M; Hillen, Marij A",Acta oncologica,461,31

This systematic review summarizes the evidence on interventions used to motivate health workers in LMICs. A standardized keyword search strategy was employed across five databases from September 2007 -September 2017. Studies had to meet the following criteria: original study; doctors and/or nurses as target population for intervention(s); work motivation as study outcome; study design with clearly defined comparison group; categorized as either a supervision, compensation, systems support, or lifelong learning intervention; and conducted in a LMIC setting. Two independent reviewers screened 3845 titles and abstracts and, subsequently, reviewed 269 full articles. Seven studies were retained from China (n = 1), Ghana (n = 2), Iran (n = 1), Mozambique (n = 1), and Zambia (n = 2). Study data and risk of bias were extracted using a standardized form. Though work motivation was the primary study outcome, four studies did not provide an outcome definition and five studies did not describe use of a theoretical framework in the ascertainment. Four studies used a randomized trial-group design, one used a non-randomized trial-group design, one used a cross-sectional design, and one used a pretest-posttest design. All three studies that found a significant positive effect on motivational outcomes had a supervision component. Of the three studies that found no effects on motivation, two were primarily compensation interventions and the third was a systems support intervention. One study found a significant negative effect of a compensation intervention on health worker motivation. In conducting this systematic review, we found there is limited evidence on successful interventions to motivate health workers in LMICs. True effects on select categories of health workers may have been obscured given that studies included health workers with a wide range of social and professional characteristics. Robust studies that use validated and culturally appropriate tools to assess worker motivation are greatly needed in the Sustainable Development Goals era.","Gupta, Jaya; Patwa, Mariya C; Khuu, Angel; Creanga, Andreea A",Human resources for health,461,8

The objective of this study was to compare the detection of respiratory virus targets using the Luminex xTAG respiratory viral panel (RVP) assay with individual real-time NATs used at the Provincial Laboratory of Public Health, Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The study included 1,530 specimens submitted for diagnosis of respiratory infections from December 2006 to May 2007. Direct-fluorescent-antigen-positive nasopharyngeal samples were excluded from this study. A total of 690 and 643 positives were detected by RVP and in-house NATs, respectively. Kappa correlation between in-house NATs and RVP for all targets ranged from 0.721 to 1.000. The majority of specimens missed by in-house NATs (96.7%) were positive for picornaviruses. Samples missed by RVP were mainly positive for adenovirus (51.7%) or respiratory syncytial virus (27.5%) by in-house NATs and in general had low viral loads. RVP allows for multiplex detection of 20 (and differentiation between 19) respiratory virus targets with considerable time and cost savings compared with alternative NATs. Although this first version of the RVP assay has lower sensitivity than in-house NATs for detection of adenovirus, it has good sensitivity for other targets. The identification of picornaviruses and coronaviruses and concurrent typing of influenza A virus by RVP, which are not currently included in our diagnostic testing algorithm, will improve our diagnosis of respiratory tract infections.","Pabbaraju, Kanti; Tokaryk, Kara L; Wong, Sallene; Fox, Julie D",Journal of clinical microbiology,461,27

Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) found in the bone marrow ensure hematopoietic homeostasis in an organism. Failure of this complex process, which involves a fine balance of self-renewal and differentiation fates, often result in severe hematological conditions such as leukemia and lymphoma. Several molecular and metabolic programs, internal or in close interaction with the bone marrow niche, have been identified as important regulators of HSPC function. More recently, nutrient sensing pathways have emerged as important modulators of HSC homing, dormancy, and function in the bone marrow. Here we describe a method for reliable measurement of various amino acids and minerals in different rare bone marrow (BM) populations, namely HSPCs. We found that the amino acid profile of the most primitive hematopoietic compartments (KLS) did not differ significantly from the one of their direct progenies (common myeloid progenitor CMP), while granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs), on the opposite of megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs), have higher content of the majority of amino acids analyzed. Additionally, we identified intermediates of the urea cycle to be differentially expressed in the KLS population and were found to lower mitochondrial membrane potential, an established readout on self-renewal capability. Moreover, we were able to profile for the first time 12 different minerals and detect differences in elemental contents between different HSPC compartments. Importantly, essential dietary trace elements, such as iron and molybdenum, were found to be enriched in granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs). We envision this amino acid and mineral profiling will allow identification of novel metabolic and nutrient sensing pathways important in HSPC fate regulation.","Girotra, Mukul; Monnard, Caroline; Konz, Tobias; Sizzano, Federico; Goulet, Laurence; Godin, Jean-Philippe; Coukos, George; Rezzi, Serge; Vannini, Nicola",International journal of molecular sciences,461,1

These technologies are well embedded in the areas of global finance, health care and defence, to name a few. This review focuses on the relevance of blockchain technology to health care. Blockchain technology will be the unifying platform for sharing patient data currently inaccessible due to the siloed architecture of legacy software systems, and as a result potentially be the basis for precision or individualized patient treatment. It will also strengthen digital security of sensitive patient data that is presently a lucrative target for cyber criminals. In the current COVID-19 environment, clinicians will rely more on telehealth to reduce person-to-person contact. This service can be delivered by the clinical team with confidence in the veracity of the patient data made accessible through the blockchain platform. Smart contracts written on the blockchain platform will reduce the possibility of international humanitarian aid to low- and middle-income countries being misspent. The pharmaceutical supply chain industry is adopting blockchain technology to ensure supply chain provenance. Similarly, the health insurance industry recognizes how the blockchain ecosystem can improve services to its members and expedite reimbursements to clinicians.","Tan, Lorwai; Tivey, David; Kopunic, Helena; Babidge, Wendy; Langley, Sally; Maddern, Guy",ANZ journal of surgery,461,1

In this study, numerical methods were implemented to approximate solutions to mathematical models that were not solvable analytically, such as a SARS model. More complex models such as a tumor growth model involve high-dimensional parameter spaces; efficient numerical simulation techniques were used to search for optimal or close-to-optimal parameter values in the equations. Runge-Kutta methods are a group of explicit and implicit numerical methods that effectively solve the ordinary differential equations in these models. Effects of the order and the step size of Runge-Kutta methods were studied in order to maximize the search accuracy and efficiency in parameter spaces of the models. Numerical simulation results showed that an order of four gave the best balance between truncation errors and the simulation speed for SIR, SARS, and tumormodels studied in the project.

Our model predicts that the key infection control measure is the use of N95 respirators, and that the combination of respirators, humidifiers, and ventilation reduces the threshold parameter (which dictates whether or not an epidemic breaks out) by approximately 20% if 70% of households comply, and by approximately 40% if 70% of households and workplaces comply (approximately 28% reduction would have been required to control the 1918 pandemic). However, only approximately 30% of the benefits in the household are achieved if these interventions are used only after the infected develops symptoms.

OBJECTIVE To characterise the distribution and clinical features of diseases associated with pediatric PH, including natural history, evaluation, therapeutic interventions and outcomes, as defined by the WSPH Classification. METHODS 1475 patients were enrolled into a multisite registry across the Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension Network (PPHNet), comprised of 8 interdisciplinary PH programs. RESULTS WSPH Groups 1 (PAH) and 3 (lung disease) were the most common primary classifications (45% and 49% of subjects, respectively). The most common Group 3 conditions were BPD and CDH. Group 1 disease was predominantly associated with congenital heart disease (60%) and idiopathic (23% of Group 1 cases). In comparison with Group 1, Group 3 subjects had better disease resolution (HR=3.1, p<0.001), tended to be younger at diagnosis (0.3 (0.0,0.6) versus 1.6 (0.1,6.9) years (median (IQR); p<0.001), and were more often male (57% versus. 45%, p<0.001). Down syndrome (DS), the most common genetic syndrome in the registry, constituted 11% of the entire PH cohort. CONCLUSIONS We find a striking proportion of pediatric PH patients with Group 3 disorders, reflecting the growing recognition of PH in diverse developmental lung diseases. Greater precision of clinical phenotyping based on disease-specific characterization may further enhance care and research of pediatric PH.","Abman, Steven H; Mullen, Mary P; Sleeper, Lynn A; Austin, Eric D; Rosenzweig, Erika B; Kinsella, John P; Ivy, Dunbar; Hopper, Rachel K; Usha Raj, J; Fineman, Jeffrey; Keller, Roberta L; Bates, Angela; Krishnan, Usha S; Avitabile, Catherine M; Davidson, Alexander; Natter, Marc D; Mandl, Kenneth D",The European respiratory journal,461,1

We investigated the presence of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in AS and how they are involved in the osteogenic capacity of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) through interleukin-17A (IL-17A). Peripheral neutrophils and sera were obtained from patients with active AS and healthy controls. NET formation and neutrophil/NET-associated proteins were studied using immunofluorescence, immunoblotting, qPCR and ELISA. In vitro co-culture systems of AS NET structures and MSCs isolated from controls were deployed to examine the role of NETs in the differentiation of MSCs towards osteogenic cells. Analysis was performed using specific staining and qPCR. Neutrophils from patients with AS were characterized by enhanced formation of NETs carrying bioactive IL-17A and IL-1β. IL-17A-enriched AS NETs mediated the differentiation of MSCs towards bone-forming cells. The neutrophil expression of IL-17A was positively regulated by IL-1β. Blocking IL-1β signaling on neutrophils with anakinra or dismantling NETs using DNase-I disrupted osteogenesis driven by IL-17A-bearing NETs. These findings propose a novel role of neutrophils in AS-related inflammation, linking IL-17A-decorated NETs with the differentiation of MSCs towards bone-forming cells. Moreover, IL-1β triggers the expression of IL-17A on NETs offering an additional therapeutic target in AS. This article is protected by copyright.

The use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is essential to prevent this occupational disease. Surgical masks and filtering face piece (FFP) respirators are important parts of this PPE. European standard EN 149 establishes three protection levels for FFP respirators (FFP1, FFP2, FFP3), depending on the particle infiltration degree through their materials, and these, in turn, are based on their filtration effectiveness. The aim of this laboratory test is to determine and quantify the filtration and fit rate of different FFP respirators, singly and in combination with surgical masks, by performing a series of fit tests and consequently, to check whether this combination improves protection levels for healthcare workers who care for COVID-19 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS Several FFP respirators and surgical masks, singly and in combination, were fit tested with a PortaCount Pro + 8038, which fulfills OSHA standards, in a series of tests performed on healthcare workers in seven different breathing situations when taking care on COVID-19 patients, in order to determine and quantify their fit to the workers' face. RESULTS Wearing a surgical mask together with a highly efficient FFP respirator provided increased respiratory protection. Interestingly, one of these highly efficient FFP models, combined with a surgical mask, achieved a protection factor over 200 (whereas 100 is the minimum required protection factor). CONCLUSIONS Surgical masks, when used together with a FFP2 respirator, could significant ly improve the degree of fit of all self-filtering face piece by providing greater filtration efficiency and greater user protection from exposure to aerosols.","García Vela, Raquel; Cabanas Valdés, Rosa; Huertas Ríos, Santos; Donat Roca, Rafel; Monné Cuevas, Pol; Moizé Arcone, Luciana; Calvo Sanz, Jordi",Archivos de prevencion de riesgos laborales,461,1

TECHNIQUE For 3DRA, the C-arm was placed in the propeller position with the foot in an isocentric position. The patient's unaffected foot was positioned in a footrest outside the field of view. For correct timing of 3DRA, the delay from contrast injection in the popliteal artery at the level of knee joint to complete pedal arterial enhancement was assessed using DSA. With this delay, 3DRA was started after injection of 15 ml contrast. Imaging of the 3DRA could directly be reconstructed and visualized. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients undergoing 3DRA of the foot were prospectively registered. DSA and 3DRA images were scored separately for arterial patency and presence of collaterals. Treatment strategies were proposed based on DSA with and without the availability of 3DRA. RESULTS Eleven patients underwent 3DRA of the foot. One 3DRA was not included because the acquisition was focused on the heel instead of the entire foot. Diagnostic quality of 3DRA was good in all ten patients. 3DRA compared with DSA showed additional patent arteries in six patients, patent plantar arch in three patients, and collaterals between the pedal arteries in five patients. Additional information from 3DRA resulted in a change of treatment strategy in six patients. CONCLUSION 3DRA of the foot contains valuable additional real-time information to better guide peripheral vascular interventions in patients with CLI and nonhealing tissue lesions.","Jens, Sjoerd; Lucatelli, Pierleone; Koelemay, Mark J W; Marquering, Henk A; Reekers, Jim A",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,461,31

We analyzed responses using descriptive statistics. RESULTS A total of 35 of 42 eligible practice sites responded (83% response rate). Most sites (51.4%) reported using telehealth less than once per month before the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the onset of COVID-19, 100% of programs reported conducting video-based telehealth visits multiple days per week. Most sites reported conducting evaluations and follow-up visits for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, behavioral concerns, developmental delay, genetic disorders, and learning disability. Most sites were able to continue medication management by telehealth (>88%), offer interpreter services for families with limited English proficiency participating in telehealth visits (>90%), and incorporate trainees and interdisciplinary team members in telehealth visits (>90%). Greater variability was observed in sites' ability to collect telehealth practice evaluation measures. CONCLUSION Most sites are providing evaluations and ongoing care for DBP conditions through telehealth. The rapid adoption of telehealth can have ramifications for the way that DBP care is delivered in the future; therefore, it is imperative to understand current practice patterns and variations to determine the best use of telehealth.","Wallis, Kate E; Mulé, Christina; Mittal, Shruti; Cerda, Natalie; Shaffer, Rebecca; Scott, Angela; Langkamp, Diane; Augustyn, Marilyn; Perrin, Ellen; Soares, Neelkamal; Blum, Nathan J",Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP,461,1

Evidence-based emerging reports of neurological manifestations show that SARS-CoV-2 can attack the nervous system. However, little is known about the biomarkers in disease in neuropsychiatric and neuroimmunological disorders. One of the important keys in the management of COVID-19 is an accurate diagnosis. Biomarkers could provide valuable information in the early detection of disease etiology, diagnosis, further treatment, and prognosis. Moreover, ongoing investigations on hematologic, biochemical, and immunologic biomarkers in nonsevere, severe, or fatal forms of COVID-19 patients provide an urgent need for the identification of clinical and laboratory predictors. In addition, several cytokines acting through mechanisms to emerge immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection are known to play a major role in neuroinflammation. Considering the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2, which can be capable of triggering a cytokine storm, the current evidence on inflammation in psychiatry and neurodegenerative by emerging neuroinflammation is discussed in this review.

Recently TP-mediated signaling has been suggested to function in multiple cell types in the brain. In this report, we aim to study the expression and physiological role of TP in microglia, in particular after brain ischemia. METHODS Ischemic brain sections were analyzed for TP expression. Microglial cell line and primary microglia were cultured, or neuronal cell line co-culture system was used to determine the TP mediated signaling in inflammation and microglia activation. RESULTS We found that the TP level was significantly increased in ipsilateral mouse brain tissue at 24 h after ischemia-reperfusion, which was also found to partly co-localize with CD11b, a marker for microglial and infiltrated monocyte/macrophage, in peri-infarct area. Immunofluorescence staining of primary microglia and microglial cell line BV2 revealed the predominant membrane distribution of TP. Conditioned culture media from TP agonist U46619-treated BV2 cells decreased neuronal SH-SY5Y cell viability and induced apoptotic morphological changes. Furthermore, U46619 enhanced IL-1β, IL-6, and iNOS mRNA expression as well as IL-1β and NO releases in BV2 cells or primary microglia. Such stimulation could be attenuated by TP antagonist SQ29548 or MEK inhibitor U0126. The dose- and time-dependent extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation induced by U46619 further demonstrated ERK signaling-mediated microglia activation by TP agonist. CONCLUSION This study has shown a novel role of TP in microglia activation via the ERK signaling pathway, which provides insights for the management of neuroinflammation in diseases like cerebral infarction.","Yang, Wanlin; Yan, Aijuan; Zhang, Tingting; Shao, Jiaxiang; Liu, Tengyuan; Yang, Xiao; Xia, Weiliang; Fu, Yi",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,461,1

This study examined whether alternative mismatch criteria can also differentiate patients according to their response to reperfusion. METHODS Patients from the DEFUSE 2 study were categorized according to vessel occlusion on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and DWI lesion volume criteria (MRA-DWI mismatch) and symptom severity and DWI criteria (clinical-DWI mismatch). Favorable clinical response was defined as an improvement of ≥8 points on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) by day 30 or an NIHSS score of ≤1 at day 30. We assessed, for each set of criteria, whether the association between reperfusion and favorable clinical response differed according to mismatch status. RESULTS A differential response to reperfusion was observed between patients with and without MRA-DWI mismatch defined as an internal carotid artery or M1 occlusion and a DWI lesion<50 mL. Reperfusion was associated with good functional outcome in patients who met these MRA-DWI mismatch criteria (odds ratio [OR], 8.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-31.3), whereas no association was observed in patients who did not meet these criteria (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.08-3.1; P for difference between the odds, 0.01). No differential response to reperfusion was observed with other variations of the MRA-DWI or clinical-DWI mismatch criteria. CONCLUSIONS The MRA-DWI mismatch is a promising alternative to DEFUSE 2's PWI-DWI mismatch for patient selection in endovascular stroke trials.","Mishra, Nishant K; Albers, Gregory W; Christensen, Søren; Marks, Michael; Hamilton, Scott; Straka, Matus; Liggins, John T P; Kemp, Stephanie; Mlynash, Michael; Bammer, Roland; Lansberg, Maarten G",Stroke,461,19

STUDY DESIGN Randomized controlled trial. ANIMALS 30 adult female dogs. METHODS Dogs were randomly assigned to ST or DS procedures. Measures of nociception were assessed through measurements of preoperative and intraoperative heart rate during manipulation of the suspensory ligament. Measures of pain were assessed through preoperative and postoperative pain scores by using the short form Glasgow Composite Pain Scale. Time efficiency was measured through total surgical time and the time to release each suspensory ligament. RESULTS After body weight was accounted for, the total surgical time was 1.1 minutes (P = .06) faster for ST than for DS, and each additional kilogram of body weight increased total surgical time by 0.1 minutes (P = .02). Digital strumming had 30.6-fold greater odds of taking greater than 1 minute compared with ST (P = .001). The heart rate from baseline to peak was 7.4 beats per minute lower in the ST group than in the DS group (P = .06). No complications were observed, and there was no difference in postoperative pain scores between treatments. CONCLUSION Sharp transection was faster and generated less intraoperative acceleration in heart rate but did not differ in postoperative outcomes compared with DS. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Sharp transection is a viable alternative to DS for breakdown of the suspensory ligament during canine OVH. Sharp transection may improve surgical efficiency, especially when performing large volumes in the spay/neuter setting and could influence veterinary student training.","Shivley, Jacob M; Richardson, Jodi M; Woodruff, Kimberly A; Brookshire, Wilson C; Meyer, Robert E; Smith, David R",Veterinary surgery : VS,461,32

This study examines the influence of resilience on the impact of COVID-related stress and enforced lockdown on mental health, drug use, and treatment adherence among people living with HIV (PLWH) in Argentina. SETTING PLWH residing predominantly in Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area and urban regions of Argentina were identified from a private clinic electronic database. METHODS Participants completed an anonymous online survey to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on economic disruption, resilience, mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, stress, and loneliness), adherence to HIV treatment, and substance use. We performed ordinary least squares and logistic regressions to test whether resilient coping buffered the impact of economic disruption on mental health and drug use during quarantine. RESULTS A total of 1336 PLWH aged 18-82 were enrolled. The impact of economic disruption on mental health ΔF(1,1321) = 8.86, P = 0.003 and loneliness ΔF(1,1326) = 5.77, P = 0.016 was buffered by resilience.

Here we recommend a technique for dissecting the secondary splenic pedicle vessels on the basis of analysis of retrospective data. STUDY DESIGN A retrospective review (April 2006 to October 2011) of databases at 2 institutions identified 136 patients who had undergone LS. In 34 patients with massive splenomegaly, primary splenic pedicle dissection technique (PSPD) had been used in 19 patients and secondary splenic pedicle dissection technique (SSPD) had been used in 15 patients. In 102 patients with normal-sized spleen or moderate splenomegaly, PSPD had been used in 56 patients and SSPD in 46 patients. We compared perioperative and follow-up data. RESULTS Laparoscopic splenectomy was completed in 128 patients. In the massive splenomegaly group, the conversion rate was 5.3% for PSPD and 33.3% for SSPD, the complication rate was 42.1% vs 20%, hospital stay was 3.2 ± 2.0 days vs 7.5 ± 3.5 days, and transfusion requirement was 1.1 ± 1.2 U vs 3.2 ± 0.9 U, respectively. However, in the normal or moderate splenomegaly group, except for complications, there were no significant differences between PSPD and SSPD techniques in perioperative findings. In the 2 groups, there were significant differences between the PSPD and SSPD techniques in pancreatic leakage (15.8% vs 0 and 8.9% vs 0, respectively) and postoperative fever (15.8% vs 6.7% and 10.7% vs 2.2%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Secondary splenic pedicle dissection can decrease the incidence of splenic fever and pancreatic leakage and is a valuable technique for LS for normal-sized spleen or moderate splenomegaly. It is not a safe procedure for massive splenomegaly because of the high conversion rate.","Yan, Qiuliang; Zhu, Jinhui; Zhan, Xiaoli; Weng, Weihong; Wu, Wanbo; Shen, Dijian; Yu, Kai; Wang, Yuedong",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,461,29

However, many urban areas have so far achieved limited results in this direction because of political, institutional, organizational, technological, infrastructural, and socio-economic barriers as well as unforeseeable (e.g., COVID-19) conditions. The overall aim of the present research study is to support policy-making by proposing a methodology that identifies and prioritizes the sustainable mobility barriers for a specific urban area, with a view to developing effective policies. Towards this purpose, this work provides, in the first phase, a comprehensive inventory of barriers based on a literature review. In the second phase, a methodology using as a basic scientific tool a modified Delphi-AHP is proposed for the adaptation of this inventory to a specific urban area and for both the evaluation and prioritization of sustainable mobility barriers. The whole process is then applied in Thessaloniki, Greece, a European city suffering from many problems related to sustainable mobility. The above pilot application confirms that this approach can be integrated as a supporting tool in the first steps of sustainable urban mobility plans (SUMPs).","Anastasiadou, Konstantina Gavanas Nikolaos Pyrgidis Christos Pitsiava-Latinopoulou Magda",Sustainability,461,16

We study whether early identified risk factors for COVID-19 persist one year later and through varying disease progression trajectories. Methods: This was a retrospective study of 6,731 COVID-19 patients presenting to Michigan Medicine between March 10, 2020 and March 10, 2021. We describe disease progression trajectories from diagnosis to potential hospital admission, discharge, readmission, or death. Outcomes pertained to all patients: rate of medical encounters, hospitalization-free survival, and overall survival, and hospitalized patients: discharge versus in-hospital death and readmission. Risk factors included patient age, sex, race, body mass index, and 29 comorbidity conditions. Results: Younger, non-Black patients utilized healthcare resources at higher rates, while older, male, and Black patients had higher rates of hospitalization and mortality. Diabetes with complications, coagulopathy, fluid and electrolyte disorders, and blood loss anemia were risk factors for these outcomes. Diabetes with complications, coagulopathy, fluid and electrolyte disorders, and blood loss were associated with lower discharge and higher inpatient mortality rates. Conclusions: This study found differences in healthcare utilization and adverse COVID-19 outcomes, as well as differing risk factors for short- and long-term outcomes throughout disease progression. These findings may inform providers in emergency departments or critical care settings of treatment priorities, empower healthcare stakeholders with effective disease management strategies, and aid health policy makers in optimizing allocations of medical resources.","Salerno, S.; Sun, Y.; Morris, E.

A pilot study explores the relationship between state mindfulness and service encounter quality. Experiment 1 examines whether a 15-min mindfulness exercise results in an increase in service employees’ state mindfulness. Experiment 2 tests whether induced state mindfulness produces higher service quality and whether a reminding technique can prolong state mindfulness between service encounters.FindingsThe results demonstrate the following. First, that more mindful employees provide better service quality. Second, that a short, easily implemented, mindfulness exercise can reliably increase employees’ state mindfulness. Third, induced mindfulness has an impact on subsequent service quality in terms of reliability, assurance, empathy and responsiveness. These effects persist regardless of the service encounter structure (high vs low structure) or the degree of emotional labor involved (high vs low emotionally charged). Finally, the reminding technique developed as part of this research suggests that state mindfulness can be maintained between service encounters.Research limitations/implicationsAs simulated (programmed) customers are used, independent evaluators to assess service quality are used. Service providers in this study are college students;future field studies should consider a wider range of service providers. The research focuses on state mindfulness;exploration of trait mindfulness offers future research opportunities.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is the first to empirically examine the link between mindfulness and service quality. It shows that mindfulness can be induced, and through a reminding technique be maintained, and improve service quality across service interactions. This is a powerful finding for marketing managers, for it offers a new method to enhance service provision. Moreover, this research implies that the increase in service quality is likely to be accompanied by reduced job burnout: a double win for employees, employers and customers.","Wang, Emma Junhong Berthon Pierre R.; Nada Nasr, Bechwati",The Journal of Services Marketing,461,16

Since SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in stool samples, quantifying SARS-CoV-2 genome by RT-qPCR in WWTPs has been proposed as an alternative tool to monitor virus circulation among human populations. However, measuring SARS-CoV-2 viral load in WWTPs can be affected by many experimental and environmental factors. To circumvent these limits, we propose here a novel indicator WWI that partly reduces and corrects the noise associated with the SARS-CoV-2 genome quantification in wastewater. This method has been successfully applied in the context of Obepine, a French national network that has been quantifying SARS-CoV-2 genome in a representative sample of French WWTPs since March 5th 2020. On August 26th, 2021, 168 WWTPs were monitored twice a week in the metropolitan and overseas territories of France. We detail the process of elaboration of this indicator, show that it is strongly correlated to the incidence rate and that the optimal time lag between these two signals is only a few days, making our indicator an efficient complement or even a credible alternative to the incidence rate.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out among COVID-19 patients (18-year-old or older) consecutively admitted to a dedicated COVID-19 hospital located in northwest Rajasthan, India. Data regarding socio-demographic parameters, KAP, and primary composite outcome (admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death) were collected. KAP scores were compared between different demographic variables and primary composite outcomes. Association between different demographic variables, primary composite outcomes, and KAP scores were determined through multivariate linear regression. Besides, the correlation among KAP scores was analyzed. Results: Out of the total 222 patients, most of them (65.76%) had average KAP scores towards COVID-19. The mean scores for knowledge were 7.88, with an overall correct rate of 71.63%;the mean attitude scores were 2.42, with an overall correct rate of 60.50%;the mean practice scores were 5.12, with an overall correct rate of 64.00%. Patients who met the primary composite outcomes had higher knowledge scores, but lower attitude and practice scores. The result showed a significant positive correlation between the level of education, socioeconomic class, and knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19. Knowledge towards COVID-19 was significantly associated with a positive attitude and good practice. Conclusions: Our findings show that adult COVID-19 patients have average KAP towards COVID-19 among COVID-19 patients. Poor attitude and practice towards COVID-19 are associated with adverse outcomes, so it is suggested to strengthen attitude and practice towards COVID-19 to improve the outcomes.","Nehara, H.

However, at present the implications of COVID-19 for people with RA remain poorly understood. Objectives: To investigate the associations between rheumatoid arthritis and the risk of COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation with COVID-19 and COVID-19-related death. Methods: A population-based cohort study including all individuals registered in the Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP). SIDIAP includes primary care records covering over 80% of the population of Catalonia, Spain, and was linked to region-wide SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, hospital and mortality records. Outpatient diagnoses of COVID-19, hospitalisations with COVID-19 and deaths with COVID-19 were identified as study outcomes between 1st March and 6th May 2020. A multi-state model was used, with cause-specific Cox survival models estimated for each transition, adjusted for age and sex. Results: A total of 5,586,565 individuals were identified in SIDIAP as of the 1st March 2020, of which 16,344 had RA. RA patients were median (IQR) 63 years (52.0, 74.0) and the majority (n=11,727, 71.8%) were female. Having RA was positively associated with being diagnosed with COVID-19 (adjusted HR 1.14 (1.03 to 1.28)), with hospitalisation with COVID-19 (HR 1.66 (1.35 to 2.04)). However, we did not find an association between RA status and the risk of worsening from outpatient diagnosis to hospitalization or death, or from hospitalization to death (see Table 1). Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the largest study performed to date looking at COVID-19 outcomes in RA patients. Individuals with RA were found to have an increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis and hospitalisation with COVID-19, compared to the general population. Further research is needed to address factors associated with this including the presence of other co-morbidities, underlying RA disease activity and the use of immunosuppressive medications.","Vivekanantham, A.; Burn, E.; Fernandez-Bertolin, S.; Aragon, M.; Duarte-Salles, T.; Prieto-Alhambra, D.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,461,26

To get CSI, the receiver performs channel estimation based on the pre-known training field of the transmitted WiFi signal.

In this paper, we open sourced a CSI fuzzer to enhance the privacy and security of WiFi CSI applications. It is built and embedded into the transmitter of openwifi, which is an open source full-stack WiFi chip design, to prevent unauthorized sensing without sacrificing the WiFi link performance. The CSI fuzzer imposes an artificial channel response to the signal before it is transmitted, so the CSI seen by the receiver will indicate the actual channel response combined with the artificial response. Only the authorized receiver, that knows the artificial response, can calculate the actual channel response and perform the CSI sensing. Another potential application of the CSI fuzzer is covert channels based on a set of pre-defined artificial response patterns.

Shortness of breath is one of the hallmark symptoms of COVID-19 infection. The main medical management for shortness of breath in COVID-19 infection is oxygen therapy. Physiotherapy and medical rehabilitation such as breathing exercise and chest physiotherapy can be adjuvant therapy that effectively improves breathing effort in COVID-19 patients. This case report will describe breathing exercises and chest therapy done in a patient with a COVID-19 infection. Case: In this study, we presented the case of a 53-year-old female patient with complaints of fever, cough, fatigue, anosmia, shortness of breath, and diagnosis with confirmed COVID-19 infection based on swab PCR result. On admission in the isolation ward, the patient was on non-invasive ventilation (NIV), medical medication, and physical therapy. The physical therapy done in this patient was breathing exercise and chest therapy once daily. After four series of chest therapy and breathing exercise, the shortness of breath and her breathing effort was improved. The patient was discharged after 15 days of hospitalization. Conclusion: This case shows the utility of chest therapy and breathing exercise as a physical rehabilitation treatment for the COVID-19 patient. This physical therapy helps to maximize lung expansion and improve the patient’s breathing effort. © 2021, Sanglah General Hospital. All rights reserved.","Prabawa, I. M.

As vaccination programs roll out globally and social distancing is relaxed, future SARS-CoV-2 trends are uncertain. Methods We analysed prevalence trends and their drivers using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab-positivity data from round 12 (between 20 May and 7 June 2021) and round 13 (between 24 June and 12 July 2021) of the Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study, with swabs sent to non-overlapping random samples of the population ages 5 years and over in England. Results We observed sustained exponential growth with an average doubling time in round 13 of 25 days (lower Credible Interval of 15 days) and an increase in average prevalence from 0.15% (0.12%, 0.18%) in round 12 to 0.63% (0.57%, 0.18%) in round 13. The rapid growth across and within rounds appears to have been driven by complete replacement of Alpha variant by Delta, and by the high prevalence in younger less-vaccinated age groups, with a nine-fold increase between rounds 12 and 13 among those aged 13 to 17 years. Prevalence among those who reported being unvaccinated was three-fold higher than those who reported being fully vaccinated. However, in round 13, 44% of infections occurred in fully vaccinated individuals, reflecting imperfect vaccine effectiveness against infection despite high overall levels of vaccination. Using self-reported vaccination status, we estimated adjusted vaccine effectiveness against infection in round 13 of 49% (22%, 67%) among participants aged 18 to 64 years, which rose to 58% (33%, 73%) when considering only strong positives (Cycle threshold [Ct] values < 27); also, we estimated adjusted vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection of 59% (23%, 78%), with any one of three common COVID-19 symptoms reported in the month prior to swabbing. Sex (round 13 only), ethnicity, household size and local levels of deprivation jointly contributed to the risk of higher prevalence of swab-positivity. Discussion From end May to beginning July 2021 in England, where there has been a highly successful vaccination campaign with high vaccine uptake, infections were increasing exponentially driven by the Delta variant and high infection prevalence among younger, unvaccinated individuals despite double vaccination continuing to effectively reduce transmission. Although slower growth or declining prevalence may be observed during the summer in the northern hemisphere, increased mixing during the autumn in the presence of the Delta variant may lead to renewed growth, even at high levels of vaccination.","Elliott, P.; Haw, D.

This need has generated a high number of new testing methods aimed at replacing RT-PCR, which is the golden standard for testing. Most of the testing techniques are based on biochemistry methods and require chemicals that are often expensive and the supply might become scarce in a large crisis. In the present paper we suggest the use of methods based on physics that leverage novel nanomaterials. We demonstrate that using Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) of virion particles a very distinct spectroscopic signature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be obtained. We demonstrate that the spectra are mainly composed by signals from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. It is believed that a clinical test using SERS can be developed. The test will be fast, inexpensive, and reliable. It is also clear that SERS can be used for analysis of structural changes on the S and N proteins. This will be an example of application of nanotechnology and properties of nanoparticles for health and social related matters.","Sanchez, J. E.; Jaramillo, S. A.; Settles, E.; Salazar, J. J.

Small molecule ENPP1 inhibitors are much needed as tools to study basic biology of extracellular cGAMP and as investigational cancer immunotherapy drugs. Here, we surveyed structure-activity relationships around a series of cell-impermeable and thus extracellular-targeting phosphonate inhibitors of ENPP1. Additionally, we solved the crystal structure of an exemplary phosphonate inhibitor to elucidate the interactions that drive potency. This study yielded several best-in-class compounds with Ki < 2 nM and excellent physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. Finally, we demonstrate that an ENPP1 inhibitor delays tumor growth in a breast cancer mouse model.

However, in cystic fibrosis (CF), despite the benefits of regular exercise being well documented (Radtke et al, 2017), there is limited uptake. Concerns regarding infection control, lack of CF education, and participating with an older age group may be contributing factors. A pilot study demonstrated good clinical benefits to participants in a CF-specific PR program (Bowen et al, 2019) and current CF Foundation guidelines advise that patients with advanced lung disease should be offered such programs (Kapnadak et al, 2020). We aimed to establish a CF-specific PR program at Manchester Adult CF Centre, as part of the CF Trust Physiotherapy Fellowship service development project. Method: Patients completed a bespoke 8-week program, comprised of biweekly 1:1 virtual exercise sessions. Each session included aerobic and strength training linked to patient goals and was progressed according to reported Borg and muscle fatigue scores. A 1-minute sit to stand test (STS) was performed pre-program and repeated at the end. Enrolled patients had access to an online educational website, which covered a range of CF-specific topics. Patient feedback was collected at the end of the program. Results: [Table Preseteed] Patient feedback indicated that 100% of participants felt their goals had been met and that they would recommend the program to other people with CF (PWCF). Conclusion: Some of the program design was in accordance with what was achievable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Alteration of outcome measures may be required as clinical services normalise. Although a small sample, initial feedback has been extremely positive, indicating that a virtual PR approach may be suitable in engaging PWCF in physical activity.

Traditionally, this remapping has been characterised by changes in the lip representation, which is assumed to be the immediate neighbour of the hand based on electrophysiological research in non-human primates. However, the orientation of facial somatotopy in humans is debated, with contrasting work reporting both an inverted and upright topography. We aimed to fill this gap in the S1 homunculus by investigating the topographic organisation of the face. Using both univariate and multivariate approaches we examined the extent of face-to-hand remapping in individuals with a congenital and acquired missing hand (hereafter one-handers and amputees, respectively), relative to two-handed controls. Participants were asked to move different facial parts (forehead, nose, lips, tongue) during fMRI scanning. We first report evidence for an upright facial organisation in all three groups, with the upper face and not the lips bordering the hand area. We further found little evidence for remapping of all tested facial parts in amputees, with no significant relationship to the chronicity of their PLP. In contrast, we found converging evidence for a complex pattern of face remapping in congenital one-handers across all facial parts, where the location of the cortical neighbour – the forehead – is shown to shift away from the deprived hand area, which is subsequently activated by the lips and the tongue. Together, our findings demonstrate that the face representation in humans is highly plastic, but that this plasticity is restricted by the developmental stage of input deprivation, rather than cortical proximity.","Root, Victoria; Muret, Dollyane; Arribas, Maite; Amoruso, Elena; Thornton, John; Tarall-Jozwiak, Aurelie; Tracey, Irene; Makin, Tamar R.",bioRxiv,461,16

We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the use of vitamin D intervention on COVID-19 outcomes. Methods: Literature search was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane library, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases (latest search on August 5, 2021). We included RCTs reporting the use of vitamin D intervention to control/placebo group in COVID-19. Two independent researchers did literature search, abstracted data, and the risk of bias assessment. Results: A total of 6 RCTs with 551 COVID-19 patients were included. The overall collective evidence pooling all the outcomes across all RCTs indicated the beneficial use of vitamin D intervention in COVID-19 (relative risk, RR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.92, Z=2.33, p=0.02, I2 = 48%). However, no statistical significance was observed for individual outcomes of ICU care (RR = 0.11, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.30, Z=1.48, p=0.14, I2 = 66%) and mortality (RR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.40, Z=0.66, p=0.02, I2 = 33%), though decreased rates were noted.

The risk of infection with the respiratory system coronavirus attracts increased attention to respiratory sensations. These two aspects can be beneficial grounds for the dysfunctional breathing-changes emergence in the breathing pattern that does not correspond to physiological needs.ObjectivesTo study the prevalence of dysfunctional breathing associated with anxiety during the COVID – 19 pandemic in Russia.MethodsThe author’s socio-demographic questionnaire, the Naimigen Questionnaire, The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were used. The survey was conducted online in May 2020. There were 582 participants (496 women&86 men) between the ages of 18 and 64.ResultsThe severity of dysfunctional breathing significantly correlated with the height of personal anxiety (r=0.488,p=0.000). Women are more likely than men to have dysfunctional breathing (18.1±9.6vs11.6 ±7.9;p=0.000) and have more expressed personal anxiety(26±10.5vs19.8 ±9.7;p=0.000). The age of respondents has an inverse correlation with personal anxiety (r=-0.147,p= 0.000), but not with dysfunctional breathing. Respondents who consider coronavirus to be a very dangerous trend to have dysfunctional breathing more than those who believe that the danger of coronavirus is exaggerated(18.1±10vs15.9 ±8.9;p=0.052).ConclusionsDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of dysfunctional breathing increases in a wide range of the population, especially among women. Since one of the dysfunctional breathing symptoms is a feeling of “difficulty inhaling”, anxious people may interpret this as shortness of breath in COVID-19, which may motivate them to seek medical help, thereby artificially increasing the burden on the health system during the COVID-19 pandemic.Conflict of interestNo significant relationships.","Koniukhovskaia, J.; Mitina, O.; Stepanova, O.; Dorokhov, E.; Pervichko, E.",European Psychiatry,461,26

This retrospective study summarizes clinical experience and analgo-sedation treatment used for this novel epidemic in an Italian ICU between February to May 2020. Methods: This is a retrospective trial of 72 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) admitted to ICU between February15, 2020 and May 15, 2020. Main Outcomes are demographic, clinical data (age, sex, medical comorbidities, respiratory supports, positive end-expiratory pressure values (PEEP), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), sedatives and analgesic drugs, their dosage and way of administration, medical treatments and patients mortality), ventilation strategies, sedation management in ICUs and patient mortality. Results: The mean age of the 72 patients included in the study was 69 years (SD ±12), 77% were male. All patients required respiratory support and sedation management according to different techniques of ventilation: 100% received deep sedation (RASS-4) before intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation and 19% received light sedation (RASS-1) and noninvasive ventilation). Conclusions: Of the 72 patients admitted in ICUs, 92% died. A total of 608 patients admitted to the AORN dei Colli “Naples” with confirmed COVID-19. In this restrospective study we have analyzed 72 (out of 608) patients that were admitted to intensive care due to worsening clinical conditions. All patients required tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation with deep sedation (RASS-4), while only 19% (patients required light sedation so RASS-1) were subsequentely swiched to light sedation because of the need of compliance with non-invasive ventilation. Sedation was obtained with propofol, remifentanil, midazolam and dexmedetomidine, according to hospital guidelines. ©2021 The Author(s).

We have previously shown that inoculation of mice with rhinovirus (RV) two days prior to inoculation with a lethal dose of influenza A virus (PR8), provides complete protection against mortality and reduces morbidity. In this study, we extended that finding to a second lethal respiratory virus, pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) and analyzed potential mechanisms whereby RV reduces lethal viral pneumonia caused by PR8 and PVM. RV prevented mortality and weight loss associated with PVM infection, suggesting that RV-mediated protection is more effective against PVM than PR8. Major changes in host gene expression upon PVM infection were delayed compared to PR8, which likely provides a larger time frame for RV-induced gene expression to alter the course of disease. Overall, RV induced earlier recruitment of inflammatory cells, while these populations were reduced at later times in RV-inoculated mice. Findings common to both virus pairs included upregulated expression of mucin-associated genes and dampening of inflammation-related genes in mice that were inoculated with RV prior to lethal virus infection. However, type I IFN signaling was required for RV-mediated protection against PR8, but not PVM. IFN signaling had minor effects on PR8 replication and contributed to controlling neutrophilic inflammation and subsequent hemorrhagic lung pathology in RV/PR8 infected mice. These findings, combined with differences in virus replication levels and disease severity, suggest that the suppression of inflammation in RV/PVM infected mice may be due to early, IFN-independent suppression of viral replication, while in RV/PR8 infected mice may be due to IFN-dependent modulation of immune responses. Thus, a mild upper respiratory viral infection can reduce the severity of a subsequent severe viral infection in the lungs through virus-dependent mechanisms. Author Summary Respiratory viruses from diverse families co-circulate in human populations and are frequently detected within the same host. Though clinical studies suggest that infection by more than one unrelated respiratory virus may alter disease severity, animal models in which we can control the doses, timing, and strains of coinfecting viruses are critical to understand how coinfection affects disease severity. In this study, we compared gene expression and immune cell recruitment between two pairs of viruses (RV/PR8 and RV/PVM) inoculated sequentially in mice that both result in reduced severity compared to lethal infection by PR8 or PVM alone. Reduced disease severity was associated with suppression of inflammatory responses in the lungs. However, differences in disease kinetics and host and viral gene expression suggest that protection by coinfection with RV may be due to distinct molecular mechanisms. Indeed, we found that antiviral cytokine signaling was required for RV-mediated protection against lethal infection by PR8, but not PVM.","Van Leuven, James T.; Gonzalez, Andres J.; Ijezie, Emmanuel C.; Wixom, Alexander Q.; Clary, John L.; Naranjo, Maricris N.; Ridenhour, Benjamin J.; Miller, Craig R.; Miura, Tanya A.",bioRxiv,461,1

Working from home is not an option for everyone. At work it may be difficult to keep social distance, which may lead to fear and anxiety of being infected with SARS-CoV-19 or of spreading the virus. Objectives: To explore frequency of anxiety and concerns related to work in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases(IRD) during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify patient and disease characteristics associated with increased anxiety. Methods: Patients in routine care followed in the nationwide Danish DANBIO registry were invited to answer an on-line questionnaire regarding current rheumatic disease activity, behavior and anxiety including current work-status and -concerns. Responses were linked to patient data previously recorded in DANBIO. Clinical factors associated with work-related concerns (completely/mostly agree versus neither/nor, completely/mostly disagree) were explored with multivariable logistic regression. Results: Among 14,758 respondents (38% of eligible patients), 5,950 patients (40%) were currently working (60% full time/31% part time/9% self-employed) (61% female, 53% rheumatoid arthritis/19% psoriatic arthritis/ 20% axial spondyloarthritis/9% other). Although 68% reported that the workplace helped to make necessary interventions, work-related concerns and anxiety were frequent. Thus, 22% found it difficult (completely/mostly agree) to keep physical distance at work and 20% were worried about going to work (Figure 1). Factors associated with concerns about going to work were female gender, longer education, other chronic conditions, biological therapy, and higher (=poorer) EQ-5D, whereas diagnosis was without significance. Similar patterns were found for other work-related concerns (not shown).

In order to deal with the health emergency, in early March 2020, the Italian government enforced strict lockdown measures. The different Italian police forces, the Polizia di Stato, Carabinieri and city police forces (Polizia Municipale), patrolled the streets, ensuring that people stayed at home and non-essential shops remained closed. These police forces received unprecedented support from the public in enforcing lockdown. People were active in their neighbourhoods, taking pictures of alleged violators and reporting them to the police, as well as posting pictures of those violating the rules on social networks. Local administrators encouraged citizens to report lockdown violations and in the case of Rome, introduced an online reporting system. This article focuses on the policing of lockdown in Italy. The article develops the argument that public attitudes, defined as policing from below, combined with policing from above by local administrators, produced a populist policing of the lockdown. Qualitative methodology is used to discuss interviews with police officers and analyse newspaper articles. Populist political forces are hegemonising in Italy, relying on the feelings of insecurity that the virus has embittered. Populist hegemony strongly influenced the policing of problems related to COVID. The lack of community policing or plural policing models within the organisation of Italian police forces, which remain a combination of continental and colonial models, has been decisive in the development of populist policing. The consequence of this is a type of 'policing on demand', with the public providing the police with intelligence and demanding enforcement.

Initial findings on computed tomography (CT) typically include peripheral multifocal bilateral ground-glass opacities, and correspondingly microscopic alveolar edema. This is followed by peripheral consolidations with air bronchogram and perilobular pattern on CT, signs of organizing pneumonia, corresponding to loose (potentially reversible) fibrosis. The posterior parts of the lungs and the lower lobes are typically more markedly affected. In severe disease with acute respiratory distress syndrome, thickened interlobular septa and crazy paving pattern appear on CT, which corresponds to histologic diffuse alveolar damage with, depending on the stage of the disease, features such as edema, hyaline membranes, reactive epithelium, inflammation, and fibrosis.","Mari Svensson, Ann; Hansen, Tomas; Nyren, Sven; Csatlós, Martin; Brunnström, Hans",Lakartidningen,461,16
189407,189407,189407,The nature of international health security.,17.946678,1.952861,2009,"Spleen cells from uninfected control mice selectively lysed BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a murine coronavirus. Lysis of infected cells occurred within 3 hr, and histocompatibility between effector and target cells was not required. This natural, cell-mediated, virus-associated cytotoxicity differed from NK cell- and T cell-mediated lysis. Spleen cells from animals infected with MHV were enriched in NK activity and were more cytotoxic to YAC-1 target cells, but did not show enhanced cytotoxicity for MHV-infected target cells. Spleen cells from beige mice, which are deficient in NK cell activity, were able to lyse MHV-infected target cells, as were spleen cells from nude mice, which are deficient in T cell activity. Lysis of MHV-infected target cells could be mediated by cells from the spleen and, to a lesser extent, by cells from the bone marrow, but not by resident peritoneal cells or thymocytes. We suggest the term ""virus killer (VK) activity"" for this phenomenon. VK activity of splenocytes from different mouse strains correlated with the ability of the splenocytes to bind purified radiolabeled MHV virions. MHV virions caused agglutination of spleen leukocytes from susceptible mouse strains, indicating that leukocyte agglutination or adsorption may provide a useful assay for coronaviruses such as MHV which lack hemagglutinating activity. SJL mouse splenocytes did not bind MHV and did not lyse infected targets. MHV bound relatively well to splenocytes of other mouse strains, but poorly to thymocytes and erythrocytes. Binding of MHV to leukocytes was not influenced by 6 mM EDTA or EGTA, indicating a lack of requirement for Mg++ or Ca++. VK activity was also resistant to EDTA and EGTA, in contrast to NK activity, which was sensitive to those chelating agents. VK activity was also unaffected by actinomycin D, cycloheximide, or puromycin, indicating that new protein synthesis was not required for lysis. Antibody to interferon-alpha/beta did not block lysis, nor was there substantially enhanced lysis mediated by leukocytes from mice infected with virus and thus exposed to high levels of interferon. VK activity was blocked by antibody directed against the peplomeric glycoprotein E2 of MHV. VK activity required infected target cells, because cells with adsorbed MHV virions were not lysed by splenocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","Holmes, K V; Welsh, R M; Haspel, M V",Journal of immunology,461,4

Here, we describe a reverse genetic system for MHV (strain A59) based upon the cloning of a full-length genomic cDNA in vaccinia virus. We show that the recombinant virus generated from cloned cDNA replicates to the same titers as the parental virus in cell culture ( approximately 10(9) PFU/ml), has the same plaque morphology, and produces the same amounts and proportions of genomic and subgenomic mRNAs in virus-infected cells. In a mouse model of neurological infection, the recombinant and parental viruses are equally virulent, they replicate to the same titers in brain and liver, and they induce similar patterns of acute hepatitis, acute meningoencephalitis, and chronic demyelination. We also describe improvements in the use of the coronavirus reverse genetic system based on vaccinia virus cloning vectors. These modifications facilitate (i) the mutagenesis of cloned cDNA by using vaccinia virus-mediated homologous recombination and (ii) the rescue of recombinant coronaviruses by using a stable nucleocapsid protein-expressing cell line for the electroporation of infectious full-length genomes. Thus, our system represents a versatile and universal tool to study all aspects of MHV molecular biology and pathogenesis. We expect this system to provide valuable insights into the replication of group II coronaviruses that may lead to the development of novel strategies against coronavirus infections, including the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.","Coley, Scott E; Lavi, Ehud; Sawicki, Stanley G; Fu, Li; Schelle, Barbara; Karl, Nadja; Siddell, Stuart G; Thiel, Volker",Journal of virology,461,12

Ninety fecal samples from calves with diarrhea, 81 samples from adult cows with diarrhea (winter dysentery), and 20 fecal samples from healthy adult cows were tested for group C rotaviruses by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immune electron microscopy, and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Three samples from adult cow diarrhea cases were positive only by RT-PCR, and a group C rotavirus was isolated from a positive sample in monkey kidney (MA104) cells (WD534tc/C). Genetically and serologically, the WD534tc/C strain was more closely related to the Cowden porcine group C strain than to the Shintoku bovine strain. Because the original cow feces also contained a group A rotavirus (detected after passage in cell culture), we hypothesized that such dual-rotavirus infections might play a role in the pathogenesis and host adaptation of rotaviruses. Thus, we examined the pathogenesis of WD534tc/C alone or combined with virulent (IND/A) or attenuated (NCDV/A) bovine group A rotaviruses in gnotobiotic calves. WD534tc/C alone induced diarrhea without (or with limited) virus shedding in inoculated calves (n = 3). In contrast, all calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and IND/A (n = 2) developed diarrhea and shed both viruses, whereas calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and NCDV/A (n = 3) developed diarrhea but did not shed either virus. Infection with WD534tc/C or NCDV/A alone caused only mild villous atrophy (jejunum and/or ileum), whereas dual infection with both viruses induced lesions throughout the small intestine. Although IND/A alone caused villous atrophy, more-widespread small intestinal lesions occurred in calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and IND/A. In conclusion, coinfection of calves with group A rotaviruses enhanced fecal shedding of a bovine group C rotavirus and the extent of histopathological lesions in the small intestines. Thus, our findings suggest a potential novel hypothesis involving dual infections for the adaptation of heterologous rotaviruses to new host species.","Chang, K O; Nielsen, P R; Ward, L A; Saif, L J",Journal of virology,461,1

Many of monoclonal antibodies are successfully adopted for therapeutic and diagnostic targeting of viral pathogens. Efficacy of antiviral neutralizing or protective antibodies depends on their ability to recognize epitopes interfering with viral infection. However, viruses are able to incessantly change their antigenic determinants to escape surveillance of humoral immune system and therefore the successful antiviral therapies require continuous development. Characterization of interactions of antibodies with prevalently conformational viral epitopes is important for understanding antibody mode of action and can help to identify conserved regions that may be exploited in designing new vaccines and virus neutralizing antibodies. In this article, we are reviewing techniques in use for characterization of conformational epitopes of monoclonal antibodies with focus on viruses.","Augustin, T; Cehlar, O; Skrabana, R; Majerova, P; Hanes, J",Acta virologica,461,24

To more accurately and reasonably treat these diseases, a more sophisticated understanding of interrelatedness is required. This review focuses on avian astroviruses (AAstVs), in particular the recent advances in our understanding of AAstV molecular biology, and also history, diagnosis, treatment and control. The known AastVs comprise duck astrovirus 1, turkey astrovirus 1 and 2, and avian nephritis virus of chickens. Nucleotide and amino acid identities between the avian and mammalian (human, ovine, bovine) astroviruses is very low (e.g. 20 to 25% and 12 to 15%, respectively) in open reading frame (ORF) 1a. There is also variation among the avian astroviruses, including between the two known types of turkey astrovirus. The ORF 1b sequence contains a number of conserved amino acid motifs; these could be the basis of degnerate oligonucleotide primers. A nomenclature for astroviruses is also proposed, based on: host species-astrovirus-type number/country(state)/reference number/year of isolation.

With a built-in 110,000-pixel digital camera, pictures of the injured digit(s) or radiograph were taken by surgical residents in the emergency room and transmitted to another camera-phone to be viewed by the remote consultant surgeon. A brief medical and trauma history of each patient was relayed also by mobile phone. The consultant surgeon then reviewed all of these patients in the emergency room shortly after the initial telemedicine referral. Separate triaging for each digital injury into three groups was recorded during remote teleconsultation and according to actual treatment by the attending surgeon as follows: group I, the injury could be managed with conservative treatment, such as secondary intention wound healing, or primary closure with or without bone shortening; group II, skin grafting or local flap coverage was required for management of the injury; and group III, microsurgery such as replantation or free flap coverage was necessary to deal with the injury. Later, triaging was also performed individually by three junior plastic residents according to image review and patient referral information. Teleconsultation through a mobile camera-phone was performed for 45 patients with injuries of 81 digits from January to May of 2003. Of these 81 digital injuries, there were 12 cases (15 percent) where disagreement of triaging occurred between the teleconsultation and the actual treatment by the attending surgeon. In image reviewing, there was 79 percent sensitivity and 71 percent specificity in remote diagnosis of the skin defect and 76 percent sensitivity and 75 percent specificity in remote identification of the bone exposure regarding the concordance of opinions of all three surgeons; there was significant discordance in triaging in 20 cases (25 percent), and the difference in triaging was partly attributed to the inability to show instances of tiny exposed digital bone or tendon in some cases under the low-resolution digital image and the situation of a bloody oozing wound. In some cases, the difficulty in evaluating the probability of primary closure of severely avulsed skin edges or the probability of executing replantation for finger amputation also contributed to different triaging outcomes. Two neglected diagnoses of transected digital nerves were found and influenced triaging, highlighting the importance of on-site physical examination during teleconsultation. The telemedicine system using a mobile camera-phone based on the global system for mobile communication is feasible and valuable for early diagnosis and triaging of digital soft-tissue injury in emergency cases, with on-line verbal communication and review of the transmitted captured image. This system has the advantages of ease of use, low cost, high portability, and mobility. With advances in hardware for digital imaging and transmission technology and the development of the third-generation advanced mobile phone system in the foreseeable future, this system has potential for future applications in telemedicine and telecare.","Hsieh, Ching-Hua; Tsai, Hui-Hong; Yin, Jir-Wen; Chen, Chih-Yuan; Yang, Johnson Chia-Shen; Jeng, Seng-Feng",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,461,16

We sought to conduct a meta-analysis comparing asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients to determine the clinical significance of preexisting asthma in COVID-19 patients. DATA SOURCES: Online databases PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and Scopus, were searched up to July 15, 2020, for papers comparing asthma versus non-asthma COVID-19 patients. STUDY SELECTION: According to prespecified inclusion criteria, this analysis included eleven retrospective studies with 107,983 COVID-19 patients. Subgroup analysis was performed based on age groups. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 59.9 years (95%CI = 51.9-67.9). Across studies, the prevalence of asthma was 11.2% (95%CI: 9.1%-13.3%) among COVID-19 patients who attended the hospitals. Asthma patients were more likely to be younger (SMD = -0.36, 95%CI = -0.61 to -0.10, p = 0.005), and obese (OR = 1.98, 95%CI = 1.54-2.55, p < 0.001), there was no differential risk of hospitalization rate, ICU admission, or development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) between asthmatic and non-asthmatic cohorts. However, asthmatic patients had increased risk of endotracheal intubation (RR = 1.27, 95%CI = 1.02-1.58, p = 0.030) especially patients aged <50 years (RR = 6.68, 95%CI = 1.76-11.13, p = 0.009). Despite this result, asthmatic patients had better recovery with a higher liability of being discharged and were less likely to die (RR = 0.80, 95%CI = 0.65-0.97, p = 0.026). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, our meta-analysis is the largest to shed light on preexisting asthma as a predictor of intubation in COVID-19, especially in young and obese patients.

Methods: Retrospective review of electronic medical records of all patients presenting to the ophthalmology department from March 23, 2020, to July 15, 2020, was compared with that from March 23, 2019, to July 15, 2019. The data between March 23, 2020, to May 31, 2020 (lockdown) and June 06, 2020, to July 15, 2020 (unlock) was compared separately. Parameters evaluated were age, gender, presenting complaints, final diagnosis, treatment advised, and surgical interventions. Results: During the lockdown, routine outpatient flow reduced by 97.14% (P < 0.001), the median age of presentation decreased to 29 years (55 years last year) and males increased by 4.7% (from 61.51% to 66.21%) in 2020. Emergency services decreased by 35.25%, percentage of children decreased by 4.28% (from 34.28% to 30%) and males increased by 13.53% (from 59.97% to 73.5%). Mechanical trauma, microbial keratitis, and conjunctivitis were the most common reasons for presentation. The former lessened by 41.75% while the latter two amplified by 1.25 times and 2 times, respectively. While sanitizer-associated chemical injury increased in proportion, endophthalmitis, and postoperative complications declined. The number of donor corneas collected and emergency therapeutic keratoplasties performed decreased by 99.61% and 92.39%, respectively (P < 0.001).

Models reflecting the patient-specific structure were fabricated based on the CT images. Appropriate reusable design, realistic mechanical properties with various material types, and 3D printers (fused deposition modeling (FDM) and PolyJet printers) were used to represent the realistic anatomical structures. As a result, the phantom printed by PolyJet reflected closer mechanical properties than those of the FDM phantom. Accuracies (mean difference ± 95 confidence interval) of phantoms by FDM and PolyJet were 0.53 ± 0.46 and 0.98 ± 0.55 mm, respectively. Phantoms were used by surgeons for VATS training, which is considered more reflective of the clinical situation than the conventional simulation phantom. In conclusion, the patient-specific, realistic, and reusable VATS phantom provides a better understanding the complex anatomical structure of a patient and could be used as an educational phantom for esophageal structure replacement in VATS.","Hong, Dayeong; Kim, HaeKang; Kim, Taehun; Kim, Yong-Hee; Kim, Namkug",Sci Rep,461,24

Such repairs are prone to failure, particularly with low pressure venous flow (bidirectional cavopulmonary connection or Fontan). We describe our experience of disconnection of central pulmonary arteries and selective systemic-PA shunt to the hypoplastic vessel. Single ventricle patients (n=12) with diffuse left pulmonary artery (LPA) hypoplasia (LPA:RPA diameter <0.7) underwent PA disconnection (ligation clip) and selective arterial shunt to the LPA. Patients with &#8804; mild atrioventricular valve regurgitation (AVVR), and no more than mild systolic dysfunction on echocardiogram were considered. Following systemic-LPA shunt, patients were re-assessed by cardiac catheterisation prior to further surgery, with follow-up catheterisation later performed and description of changes observed. Increased volume loading was well tolerated with no greater than mild AVVR and preserved systolic function (normal or mildly reduced). Selective arterial shunting increased the caliber of the LPA from 4.1 mm (1.2-5.6) to 6.5 mm (1.7-11.9) and this increase was preserved post-Fontan (6.7 mm (1.3-8.0)) (median (range)). Ventricular end diastolic pressure (EDP) increased with arterial shunting but resolved after shunt takedown and Fontan completion (median +3 and -4 mmHg respectively). Post-Fontan hospital length of stay was not prolonged (median 11 days, range 7-14). No deaths occurred. In univentricular hearts and PA hypoplasia, selective systemic-PA shunting physiologically increases the caliber of the distal vessels. In selected patients this can be done safely with maintenance of PA growth and resolution of the elevated EDP with Fontan completion.","Seaman, Cameron S; d039,; Udekem, Yves; Jones, Bryn; Brizard, Christian; Cheung, Michael M H",Semin. thorac. cardiovasc. surg,461,33

We examined the relationship between blood group and clinical outcomes in individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and compared their blood group distribution with the general population. METHODS: At the inception of the pandemic, all individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Kuwait were admitted to one designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospital and enrolled in a prospective registry. Patients admitted from February 24 to May 27, 2020, were stratified according to blood group. As a control, blood groups of 3,730,027 anonymized individuals representing almost Kuwait's entire population were obtained from a national database. RESULTS: Of 3305 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, 37.1%, 25.5%, 28.9%, and 8.5% were groups O, A, B, and AB, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed no significant differences in severe clinical outcomes or death among the blood groups. However, multivariable analysis demonstrated that group A individuals had higher odds of developing pneumonia compared with non-group A (adjusted odds ratio 1.32, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.72, p < .036). Compared with the general population, the COVID-19 cohort had a lower frequency of group O, equivalent frequency of A, and higher frequency of B and AB. No significant difference in the RhD group was found. CONCLUSION: This study supports potential involvement of the ABO blood group system in predisposing to infection with SARS-CoV-2 in an unselected population.

The polymerization is initiated by primary amine initiators using N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as solvent. Carrying out the reaction in a silicon microflow reactor speeds up the rate of ROP (92% conversion in 40 min in flow as opposed to 6 h in batch) due to highly efficient permeation of CO2 through the reactor tubing. The polymerization strategy provides a facile, scale-up friendly alternative to traditional batch mode polymerization and has the capability of streamlining NCA ROP.","Vrijsen, Jeroen Hendrik; Rasines Mazo, Alicia; Junkers, Tanja; Qiao, Greg Guanghua",Macromol Rapid Commun,461,16

Therapies targeting this population were a recent addition to the multiple sclerosis (MS) drugs portfolio. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the risk of severe COVID-19 have challenged the safety of B cell depletion in MS patients. STATE OF THE ART: Selective depletion of B cells by monoclonal antibodies as monotherapy in MS has been shown to profoundly suppress disease activity among relapsing-remitting MS patients. Furthermore ocrelizumab, a humanised anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, was the first licensed therapy in primary progressive MS. Based on the concept of the role of B cells in MS, many therapeutic approaches are emerging as novel ways to treat autoimmune demyelination. However, during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a conservative approach toward limiting immune suppression in MS patients has been proposed. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Emerging evidence does not support the notion of increased susceptibility among MS patients to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, or any predisposition toward greater severity of COVID-19. This also does not appear to be the case for MS patients undergoing B cell depletion therapies. Thus, any decision to withhold immune suppression in MS patients during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is probably incorrect. MS therapeutic decision-making should focus on the danger of poorly controlled autoimmune demyelination rather than perceived risks from COVID-19. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: The current pandemic highlights the need to develop more selective and safer methods of immunomodulation in MS. B cells represent several functionally different populations. Further research into the different role of these cells during autoimmune demyelination should yield better, safer strategies to control the encephalitogenic process.","Mycko, Marcin P",Neurol. neurochir. pol,461,29

Here, we report nine newly evolved SARS-CoV-2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) alleles those underwent a rapid increase (seven cases) or decrease (two cases) in their frequency for 30-80% in the initial four months, which are further confirmed by intrahost single nucleotide variation analysis using raw sequence data including 8,217 samples. The nine SNPs are mostly (8/9) located in the coding region and are mainly (6/9) nonsynonymous substitutions. The nine SNPs show a complete linkage in SNP pairs and belong to three different linkage groups, named LG_1 to LG_3. Analyses in population genetics show signatures of adaptive selection toward the mutants in LG_1, but no signal of selection for LG_2. Population genetic analysis results on LG_3 show geological differentiation. Analyses on geographic COVID-19 cases and published clinical data provide evidence that the mutants in LG_1 and LG_3 benefit virus replication and those in LG_1 have a positive correlation with the disease severity in COVID-19-infected patients. The mutants in LG_2 show a bias toward mildness of the disease based on available public clinical data.

Over the years this prescription tool was updated several times: starting from a paper form without any template (""paper TP"") to a template defined by AIFA to collect specific clinical information, up to a web-based form to collect all information into a database. Over time-critical issues concerning its usefulness have been raised, especially when AIFA established several extensions for TP validity to ensure the social distancing required by the covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, after several years from their establishment, pending adoption of necessary implementing of Ministerial Decree of 25th March 2020, a check of the actual impact of TPs is required, in order to plan their review. This study provide a detailed overview of all TPs active in Italy at the 11th May 2020. From Farmadati database, all drugs reimbursed by the National Health Service (class A drugs) and requiring TP were selected. The consumption of these drugs has been derived from OsMed Reports that make available data of medicines consumption and expenditure in the general population in Italy. The analysis showed that TP is required for the prescription of 935 medicinal products (9.6% of class-A drugs) and 147 different active substances (belonging to 34 different Therapeutic Groups and 66 subgroups). Out of these, 67 (46%) required a paper TP without any template, 72 (49%) a paper TP on AIFA template, and 8 (5%) a web-based TP. The Therapeutic Group with the largest number of active ingredients with TP were antidiabetics (19.7%), followed by immunomodulating and immunosuppressants (9.5%) and medications for asthma and COPD (6.8%). Consumption analysis of drugs with TP showed that this prescription tool covers 943,899,598 DDD per year, equal to 2,586,026 DDD/day. This means that TPs have a very high impact in terms of the prevalence of patients treated on the entire care process. Of all annual DDDs prescribed on TP, 46.8% concerned drugs with TP on template AIFA, 34.5% drugs with web-based TP, while the remaining 18.7% drugs with paper TP without a template. This analysis may provide the basis for an analytical case-by-case review of TP maintenance needs, trying to maximize the benefits of this tool and to reduce its possible adverse effects. This review could be helpful to ensure the appropriateness in the drug uses, to enhance the role of general medicine, and to simplify the pathways of millions of patients ensuring the continuity of their care.","Piccinni, Carlo; Addesi, Alice; Pedrini, Antonella; Esposito, Immacolata; Rampazzo, Roberta; Mezzalira, Luigi; Trentin, Luca; Font, Maria; Trotta, Francesco; Pierantozzi, Andrea; Di Filippo, Aurora; Altamura, Gianluca; Da Cas, Roberto; Martini, Nello",Recenti Prog Med,461,16

In the face of the global economic repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, community-led approaches are required to address the setting-specific needs of residents and reduce the adverse impacts of widespread financial strain. To encourage evidence-informed best practices, a provincial health authority and community-engaged research centre collaborated to conduct a rapid review. We augmented the rapid review with an environmental scan and interviews. Our data focused on Western Canada and was collected prior to the pandemic (May-September 2019). We identified eight categories of community-led strategies to promote financial well-being: systems navigation and access; financial literacy and skills; emergency financial assistance; asset building; events and attractions; employment and educational support; transportation; and housing. We noted significant gaps in the evidence, including methodological limitations of the included studies (e.g. generalisability, small sample size), a lack of reporting on the mechanisms leading to the outcomes and evaluation of long-term impacts, sparse practice-based data on evaluation methods and outcomes, and limited intervention details in the published literature. Critically, few of the included interventions specifically targeted financial strain and/or well-being. We discuss the implications of these gaps in addition to possibilities and priorities for future research and practice.

National healthcare services have to manage unexpected shortages of healthcare resources that have to be re-allocated according to the principles of fair and ethical prioritisation, in order to maintain the highest levels of care to all patients, ensure the safety of patients and healthcare workers, and save as many lives as possible. Also, cancer care services have to pursue restructuring, following the same evidence-based dispositions. In this article, we propose a guidance to the management of pancreatic cancer during the pandemic, prioritised according to a three-tiered framework, and based on expert clinical judgement and magnitude of benefit expected from specific interventions. Since the availability of resources for diagnostic procedures, surgery and postoperative care, systemic therapy and radiotherapy may differ, the authors have separated the prioritisation analyses. The impact of postponing or abrogating cancer interventions on outcomes according to a high, medium or low priority scale is outlined and discussed. The implementation of healthcare services using telemedicine is explored; it reveals itself as functional and effective for limiting patients' need to travel to centres and thereby has the potential to reduce diffusion of SARS-CoV-2. Pancreatic cancer demands a considerable amount of medical resources. Therefore, the redefinition of its diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms with a rigorous method is crucial in order to ensure the highest quality of continuum of care in the broader context of the pandemic and the challenged healthcare systems.","Catanese, Silvia; Pentheroudakis, George; Douillard, Jean-Yves; Lordick, Florian",,461,26

These symptoms are also known as a behavioral risk marker in predicting pediatric mood disorders. The underlying neural mechanism of emotional dysregulation, however, remains unclear. This study used the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique to identify anatomically specific variation in white-matter microstructure that is associated with pediatric emotional dysregulation severity. Thirty-two children (mean age 9.53 years) with varying levels of emotional dysregulation symptoms were recruited by the Massachusetts General Hospital and underwent the DTI scans at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Emotional dysregulation severity was measured by the empirically-derived Child Behavior Checklist Emotional Dysregulation Profile that includes the Attention, Aggression, and Anxiety/Depression subscales. Whole-brain voxel-wise regression tests revealed significantly increased radial diffusivity (RD) and decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the cingulum-callosal regions linked to greater emotional dysregulation in the children. The results suggest that microstructural differences in cingulum-callosal white-matter pathways may manifest as a neurodevelopmental vulnerability for pediatric mood disorders as implicated in the clinical phenotype of pediatric emotional dysregulation. These findings may offer clinically and biologically relevant neural targets for early identification and prevention efforts for pediatric mood disorders.","Hung, Yuwen; Uchida, Mai; Gaillard, Schuyler L; Woodworth, Hilary; Kelberman, Caroline; Capella, James; Kadlec, Kelly; Goncalves, Mathias; Ghosh, Satrajit; Yendiki, Anastasia; Chai, Xiaoqian J; Hirshfeld-Becker, Dina R; Whitfield-Gabrieli, Susan; Gabrieli, John D E; Biederman, Joseph",Neuroimage Clin,461,22

Objective: This study aimed to forecast the first pandemic wave of coronavirus disease 2019 in the general population and the incidence of severe, critical, and fatal coronavirus disease 2019 cases during delivery hospitalization in the United States. Study Design: We used a phenomenological model to forecast the incidence of the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 in the United States. Incidence data from March 1, 2020, to April 14, 2020, were used to calibrate the generalized logistic growth model. Subsequently, Monte Carlo simulation was performed for each week from March 1, 2020, to estimate the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 for delivery hospitalizations during the first pandemic wave using the available data estimate. Results: From March 1, 2020, our model forecasted a total of 860,475 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in the general population across the United States for the first pandemic wave. The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 during delivery hospitalization is anticipated to be 16,601 (95% confidence interval, 9711-23,491) cases, 3308 (95% confidence interval, 1755-4861) cases of which are expected to be severe, 681 (95% confidence interval, 1324-1038) critical, and 52 (95% confidence interval, 23-81) fatal. Assuming similar baseline maternal mortality rate as the year 2018, we projected an increase in maternal mortality rate in the United States to at least 18.7 (95% confidence interval, 18.0-19.5) deaths per 100,000 live births as a direct result of coronavirus disease 2019. Conclusion: Coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnant women is expected to severely affect obstetrical care. From March 1, 2020, we forecast 3308 severe and 681 critical cases with about 52 coronavirus disease 2019-related maternal mortalities during delivery hospitalization for the first pandemic wave in the United States. These results are significant for informing counseling and resource allocation.","Putra, Manesha; Kesavan, Malavika; Brackney, Kerri; Hackney, David N; Roosa, Kimberlyn M",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,461,2

The lockdown has affected and challenged different medical areas. Doctors, nurses, dentists, and other health care workers are concerned about contagion, not only for themselves, but also for their families and colleagues. Furthermore, the oral mucosa has been accepted as a high-risk route of transmission for COVID-19. In many countries, dentists have been forced to stop working during quarantine until further notification. Isolation and its financial impact have produced physical and psychological pressure, depression, social anxiety, and other mental health concerns. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the consequences of past epidemics on mental health and to assess possible aspects that might be associated with mental implications in dentists during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, some concrete actions to avoid subsequent potential consequences are recommended.","Vergara-Buenaventura, Andrea; Chavez-Tuñon, Mariella; Castro-Ruiz, Carmen",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,461,20

Increasing transparency around the representation of these populations in health care professions may encourage efforts to increase diversity that could improve cultural competence among health care professionals and reduce health disparities. Objective: To estimate the racial/ethnic diversity of the current health care workforce and the graduate pipeline for 10 health care professions and to evaluate whether the diversity of the pipeline suggests greater representation of Black, Hispanic, and Native American populations in the future. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used weighted data from the 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) to compare the diversity of 10 health care occupations (advanced practice registered nurses, dentists, occupational therapists, pharmacists, physical therapists, physician assistants, physicians, registered nurses, respiratory therapists, and speech-language pathologists) with the diversity of the US working-age population, and 2019 data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) were used to compare the diversity of graduates with that of the US population of graduation age. Data from the IPEDS included all awards and degrees conferred between July 1, 2018, and June 30, 2019, in the US. Main Outcomes and Measures: A health workforce diversity index (diversity index) was developed to compare the racial/ethnic diversity of the 10 health care professions (or the graduates in the pipeline) analyzed with the racial/ethnic diversity of the current working-age population (or average student-age population). For the current workforce, the index was the ratio of current workers in a health occupation to the total working-age population by racial/ethnic group. For new graduates, the index was the ratio of recent graduates to the population aged 20 to 35 years by racial/ethnic group. A value equal to 1 indicated equal representation of the racial/ethnic groups in the current workforce (or pipeline) compared with the working-age population. Results: The study sample obtained from the 2019 ACS comprised a weighted total count of 148 358 252 individuals aged 20 to 65 years (White individuals: 89 756 689; Black individuals: 17 916 227; Hispanic individuals: 26 953 648; and Native American individuals: 1 108 404) who were working or searching for work and a weighted total count of 71 608 009 individuals aged 20 to 35 years (White individuals: 38 995 242; Black individuals: 9 830 765; Hispanic individuals: 15 257 274; and Native American individuals: 650 221) in the educational pipeline. Among the 10 professions assessed, the mean diversity index for Black people was 0.54 in the current workforce and in the educational pipeline. In 5 of 10 health care professions, representation of Black graduates was lower than representation in the current workforce (eg, occupational therapy: 0.31 vs 0.50). The mean diversity index for Hispanic people was 0.34 in the current workforce; it improved to 0.48 in the educational pipeline but remained lower than 0.50 in 6 of 10 professions, including physical therapy (0.33). The mean diversity index for Native American people was 0.54 in the current workforce and increased to 0.57 in the educational pipeline. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that Black, Hispanic, and Native American people were underrepresented in the 10 health care professions analyzed. Although some professions had greater diversity than others and there appeared to be improvement among graduates in the educational pipeline compared with the current workforce, additional policies are needed to further strengthen and support a workforce that is more representative of the population.","Salsberg, Edward; Richwine, Chelsea; Westergaard, Sara; Portela Martinez, Maria; Oyeyemi, Toyese; Vichare, Anushree; Chen, Candice P",JAMA Netw Open,461,16

Moreover, conscientious employees tend to be more satisfied and less stressed from their work. One consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, is that many workers have transitioned to working remotely, often under conditions of less direct supervision and less clarity about expected work activities and outcomes. We proposed that this significant change in work context constitutes a weakening of situational strength that can change the relationship of conscientiousness with job strain, job satisfaction, and job performance. Using Meyer et al.'s (2010) conceptualization of situational strength, we tested the moderating effect of situational strength by surveying 474 white-collar employees in a Fortune-1000 firm in 2019 and again in 2020 after they had all transitioned to working remotely. We found that the changes in work context due to COVID-19 significantly lowered scores on situational strength and this was accompanied by a stronger positive effect of conscientiousness on performance. Importantly, during COVID-19, the relationships of conscientiousness with strain and satisfaction showed a reversal of sign, with more conscientious workers reporting higher strain and lower satisfaction. These effects were partially mediated by job demands and were replicated with work hours. The results provide a test of situational strength theory and suggest that changes in situational strength due to COVID-19 may cause an organization's most conscientious employees to be at elevated risk for burnout and dissatisfaction, and consequently, turnover, if not managed appropriately.

Lianhua Qingwen capsule (LQC) has shown therapeutic effects in patients with COVID-19. This study is aimed to discover its molecular mechanism and provide potential drug targets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An LQC target and COVID-19-related gene set was established using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology database and seven disease-gene databases. Gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were performed to discover the potential mechanism. Molecular docking was performed to visualize the patterns of interactions between the effective molecule and targeted protein. RESULTS: A gene set of 65 genes was generated. We then constructed a compound-target network that contained 234 nodes of active compounds and 916 edges of compound-target pairs. The GO and KEGG indicated that LQC can act by regulating immune response, apoptosis and virus infection. PPI network and subnetworks identified nine hub genes. The molecular docking was conducted on the most significant gene Akt1, which is involved in lung injury, lung fibrogenesis and virus infection. Six active compounds of LQC can enter the active pocket of Akt1, namely beta-carotene, kaempferol, luteolin, naringenin, quercetin and wogonin, thereby exerting potential therapeutic effects in COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The network pharmacological strategy integrates molecular docking to unravel the molecular mechanism of LQC. Akt1 is a promising drug target to reduce tissue damage and help eliminate virus infection.","Xia, Qi-Dong; Xun, Yang; Lu, Jun-Lin; Lu, Yu-Chao; Yang, Yuan-Yuan; Zhou, Peng; Hu, Jia; Li, Cong; Wang, Shao-Gang",Cell Prolif,461,16

Cross-sectional studies already evidence deleterious psychological consequences, with poor sleep as a risk factor for impaired mental health. However, limitations of cross-sectional assessments are response bias tendencies, and the inability to track daily fluctuations in specific subjective experiences in extended confinement conditions. In a prospective study conducted across three European countries, we queried participants (N = 166) twice a day through an online interface about their sleep quality and their negative psychological experiences for two consecutive weeks. Focus was set on between-and within-person associations of subjective sleep quality with daytime experiences such as rumination, psychotic-like experiences, and somatic complaints about the typical symptoms of the coronavirus. Results show that daily reports of country-specific COVID-19 deaths predicted increased negative mood, psychotic-like experiences and somatic complaints during the same day, and decreased subjective sleep quality the following night. Disrupted sleep was globally associated with negative psychological outcomes during the study period, and a relatively poorer night of sleep predicted increased rumination, psychotic-like experiences, and somatic complaints the following day. This temporal association was not paralleled by daytime mental complaints predicting relatively poorer sleep quality on the following night. Our findings show that night-to-night changes in sleep quality predict how individuals cope the next day with daily challenges induced by home confinement.","Simor, Péter; Polner, B; Báthori, N; Sifuentes-Ortega, R; Van Roy, A; Albajara Sáenz, A; Luque González, A; Benkirane, O; Nagy, T; Peigneux, P",Sleep,461,21

Here we use the national healthcare databases of the US Department of Veterans Affairs to systematically and comprehensively identify 6-month incident sequelae-including diagnoses, medication use and laboratory abnormalities-in patients with COVID-19 who survived for at least 30 days after diagnosis. We show that beyond the first 30 days of illness, people with COVID-19 exhibit a higher risk of death and use of health resources. Our high-dimensional approach identifies incident sequelae in the respiratory system, as well as several other sequelae that include nervous system and neurocognitive disorders, mental health disorders, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, malaise, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain and anaemia. We show increased incident use of several therapeutic agents-including pain medications (opioids and non-opioids) as well as antidepressant, anxiolytic, antihypertensive and oral hypoglycaemic agents-as well as evidence of laboratory abnormalities in several organ systems. Our analysis of an array of prespecified outcomes reveals a risk gradient that increases according to the severity of the acute COVID-19 infection (that is, whether patients were not hospitalized, hospitalized or admitted to intensive care). Our findings show that a substantial burden of health loss that spans pulmonary and several extrapulmonary organ systems is experienced by patients who survive after the acute phase of COVID-19. These results will help to inform health system planning and the development of multidisciplinary care strategies to reduce chronic health loss among individuals with COVID-19.","Al-Aly, Ziyad; Xie, Yan; Bowe, Benjamin",Nature (Lond.),461,16

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of children and adolescents (<21 years of age) with a SARS-CoV-2-infected close contact. We collected nasopharyngeal or nasal swabs at enrollment and tested for SARS-CoV-2 using a real-time PCR assay. RESULTS: Of 382 children, 293 (77%) were SARS-CoV-2-infected. SARS-CoV-2-infected children were more likely to be Hispanic (p<0.0001), less likely to have asthma (p=0.005), and more likely to have an infected sibling contact (p=0.001) than uninfected children. Children ages 6-13 years were frequently asymptomatic (39%) and had respiratory symptoms less often than younger children (29% vs. 48%; p=0.01) or adolescents (29% vs. 60%; p<0.0001). Compared to children ages 6-13 years, adolescents more frequently reported influenza-like (61% vs. 39%; p<0.0001), gastrointestinal (27% vs. 9%; p=0.002), and sensory symptoms (42% vs. 9%; p<0.0001), and had more prolonged illnesses [median (IQR) duration: 7 (4, 12) vs. 4 (3, 8) days; p=0.01]. Despite the age-related variability in symptoms, we found no differences in nasopharyngeal viral load by age or between symptomatic and asymptomatic children. CONCLUSIONS: Hispanic ethnicity and an infected sibling close contact are associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among children, while asthma is associated with decreased risk. Age-related differences in the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection must be considered when evaluating children for COVID-19 and in developing screening strategies for schools and childcare settings.","Hurst, Jillian H; Heston, Sarah M; Chambers, Hailey N; Cunningham, Hannah M; Price, Meghan J; Suarez, Lilianna; Crew, Carter G; Bose, Shree; Aquino, Jhoanna N; Carr, Stuart T; Griffin, S Michelle; Smith, Stephanie H; Jenkins, Kirsten; Pfeiffer, Trevor S; Rodriguez, Javier; DeMarco, C Todd; De Naeyer, Nicole A; Gurley, Thaddeus C; Louzao, Raul; Zhao, Congwen; Cunningham, Coleen K; Steinbach, William J; Denny, Thomas N; Lugo, Debra J; Moody, M Anthony; Permar, Sallie R; Rotta, Alexandre T; Turner, Nicholas A; Walter, Emmanuel B; Woods, Christopher W; Kelly, Matthew S",Clin. infect. dis,461,16

We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, distress, and insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We searched online biomedical databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Ovid, CNKI, and Wanfang Data) and preprint databases (SSRN, bioRxiv, and MedRxiv) for observational studies from January 1, 2020 to March 16, 2020 investigating the prevalence of mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: We retrieved 821 citations from the biomedical databases and 53 citations from the preprint databases: 66 studies with 221,970 participants were included in our meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety, distress, and insomnia was 31.4%, 31.9%, 41.1% and 37.9%, respectively. Noninfectious chronic disease patients, quarantined persons, and COVID-19 patients had a higher risk of depression (Q=26.73, p<0.01) and anxiety (Q=21.86, p<0.01) than other populations. The general population and non-medical staff had a lower risk of distress than other populations (Q=461.21, p< 0.01). Physicians, nurses, and non-medical staff showed a higher prevalence of insomnia (Q=196.64, p<0.01) than other populations. LIMITATIONS: All included studies were from the early phase of the global pandemic. Additional meta-analyses are needed to obtain more data in all phases of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic increases the mental health problems of the global population, particularly health care workers, noninfectious chronic disease patients, COVID-19 patients, and quarantined persons.

Isolation is an important aspect of infection prevention and control, but has been associated with undesirable consequences among hospital inpatients. The aim of the present study was to determine if isolation is associated with an increased length of stay (LOS) in the ED. METHODS: The Registry for Emergency Care Project is a prospective cohort study with a series of nested sub-studies. The present study was a retrospective analysis of adult patients allocated an Australasian Triage Scale category of 1 or 2 who presented to a tertiary ED between 18 and 31 May 2020. The primary outcome was ED LOS. Regression methods were used to determine the independent association between ED isolation and LOS. RESULTS: There were 447 patients who met inclusion criteria, of which 123 (28%) were managed in isolation. The median (interquartile range) ED LOS was 259 (210-377) min for the isolation group and 204 (126-297) min for the non-isolation group, a difference in median ED LOS of 55 min (P < 0.001). Isolation was independently associated with a 23% increase in ED LOS (P = 0.002) and doubled the odds of an ED stay of more than 4 h (adjusted odds ratio 2.2 [1.4-3.4], P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Consistent with the anecdotal experience of Australian ED clinicians, the present study demonstrated an increased ED LOS for patients managed in isolation. Enhanced infection prevention and control precautions will be required during and beyond the current pandemic, creating significant ongoing challenges for emergency care systems.","O039,; Reilly, Gerard M; Mitchell, Rob D; Mitra, Biswadev; Noonan, Michael P; Hiller, Ryan; Brichko, Lisa; Luckhoff, Carl; Paton, Andrew; Smit, De Villiers; Cameron, Peter A",Emerg Med Australas,461,33

We aimed to investigate whether serum ferritin level predicts mortality is a marker for rapid progression for inpatients. Our study included 56 patients who were died due to COVID-19 as the study group, and 245 patients who were hospitalized and recovered as the control group. The laboratory data of the patients were evaluated from the first blood tests (pre) taken from the first moment of admission to the hospital and the blood tests taken from before the patient's discharge or exitus (post) were evaluated retrospectively. The mean age of the nonsurvivor group was 62.0 ± 15.7 and the mean age of the control group was 54.34 ± 13.03. Age and length of stay are significantly higher in the nonsurvivor group. When comparing the pre- and postvalues of ferritin, according to the two groups separately, there was no significant difference in the control group and a high level of significance was observed in the nonsurvivor group (p < .01). COVID-19 disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 causes high mortality with widespread inflammation and cytokine storm. Ferritin is a cheap and widespread available marker, ferritin, which can be used for its predictivity of the mortality and hope it would be a useful marker for clinicians for the management of the disease.","Tural Onur, Seda; Altin, Sedat; Sokucu, Sinem Nedime; Fikri, Burcu Ileri; Barça, Tugçe; Bolat, Erkut; Toptas, Mehmet",J. med. virol,461,16

We compared the cut-off indexes (COIs) between all control samples (HCWs and pre-pandemic) to generate an optimised COI limit for reactivity. RESULTS: The assay specificity was 99.8% (n = 980) and sensitivity was 45.9-96.7% (n = 279). When tested &#8805; 14 days post-positive RT-PCR (POS), the PPV/NPV was 96.4%/99.8%.

General dental practices are obligated by NHS guidance to remain open and provide remote consultation and referral where appropriate to patients having pain or problems. AIMS: To compare two urgent dental centres with different triage and referral systems with regard to quality and appropriateness of referrals, and patient management outcomes. METHODS: 110 consecutive referrals received by a primary care urgent dental centre and a secondary care urgent dental centre were assessed. It was considered whether the patients referred had access to remote primary care dental services, fulfilled the criteria required to be deemed a dental emergency as mandated by NHS guidance, and what the outcomes of referrals were. RESULTS: At the primary care centre, 100% of patients were referred by general dental practitioners and had access to remote primary care dental services. 95.5% of referrals were deemed appropriate and were seen for treatment. At the secondary care site, 94.5% of referrals were direct from the patient by contacting NHS 111. 40% had received triaging to include 'advice, analgesia and antimicrobial' from a general dental practitioner, and 25.5% were deemed appropriate and resulted in treatment.

Our hemodialysis unit experienced a COVID-19 outbreak despite following symptom-based screening guidelines. We describe the course of the COVID-19 outbreak and the infection control measures taken for mitigation. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 237 maintenance hemodialysis patients and 93 hemodialysis staff at a single hemodialysis center in Toronto, Canada. EXPOSURE: Universal screening of patients and staff for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples from patients and staff using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Descriptive statistics were used for clinical characteristics and the primary outcome. RESULTS: 11 of 237 (4.6%) hemodialysis patients and 11 of 93 (12%) staff members had a positive RT-PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2. Among individuals testing positive, 12 of 22 (55%) were asymptomatic at time of testing and 7 of 22 (32%) were asymptomatic for the duration of follow-up. One patient was hospitalized at the time of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 4 additional patients with positive test results were subsequently hospitalized. 2 (18%) patients required admission to the intensive care unit. After 30 days' follow-up, no patients had died or required mechanical ventilation. No hemodialysis staff required hospitalization. Universal droplet and contact precautions were implemented during the outbreak. Hemodialysis staff with SARS-CoV-2 infection were placed on home quarantine regardless of symptom status. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including asymptomatic individuals, were treated with droplet and contact precautions until confirmation of negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results. Analysis of the outbreak identified 2 index cases with subsequent nosocomial transmission within the dialysis unit and in shared shuttle buses to the hemodialysis unit.

Under normal circumstances, gross anatomy classes give students opportunities to touch and observe human bones and cadaveric tissues, thus enhancing their understanding; such morphology is difficult to learn from textbooks alone. As many studies have shown, three-dimensional (3D) technologies used in online lectures can serve as alternatives to real specimens for providing knowledge of anatomy. However, such technologies are often expensive. The goal of this study was to create 3D anatomy models for online lectures using a free cellphone app. Free application software (Qlone) was used to create 3D anatomical models. The extracranium and intracranium of adult skull, fetal skull, mandible, temporal bone, second cervical vertebra, and ilium were all scanned and exported to the computer in 3D format. A total of 53 anatomical structures were evaluated by nine observers. Although the 53 structures used in this study did not include all the structures that students need to learn, visibility was good/acceptable for most of the 53. The free and simple 3D scanning app used in this study could enable anatomy educators to provide better content to students during online lectures.","Iwanaga, Joe; Terada, Satoshi; Kim, Hee-Jin; Tabira, Yoko; Arakawa, Takamitsu; Watanabe, Koichi; Dumont, Aaron S; Tubbs, R Shane",Clin Anat,461,31

However, research examining the efficacy and safety of favipiravir for patients with COVID-19 is limited. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of published studies reporting the efficacy of favipiravir against COVID-19. Two investigators independently searched PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MedRxiv, and ClinicalTrials.gov (inception to September 2020) to identify eligible studies. A meta-analysis was performed to measure viral clearance and clinical improvement as the primary outcomes. RESULTS: Among 11 eligible studies, 5 included a comparator group. Comparing to the comparator group, the favipiravir group exhibited significantly better viral clearance on day 7 after the initiation of treatment (odds ratio [OR] = 2.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19-5.22), whereas no difference was noted on day 14 (OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 0.69-6.95). Although clinical improvement was significantly better in the favipiravir group on both days 7 and 14, the improvement was better on day 14 (OR = 3.03, 95% CI = 1.17-7.80) than on day 7 (OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.03-2.49). The estimated proportions of patients with viral clearance in the favipiravir arm on days 7 and 14 were 65.42 and 88.9%, respectively, versus 43.42 and 78.79%, respectively, in the comparator group. The estimated proportions of patients with clinical improvement on days 7 and 14 in the favipiravir group were 54.33 and 84.63%, respectively, compared with 34.40 and 65.77%, respectively, in the comparator group. CONCLUSIONS: Favipiravir induces viral clearance by 7 days and contributes to clinical improvement within 14 days. The results indicated that favipiravir has strong possibility for treating COVID-19, especially in patients with mild-to-moderate illness. Additional well-designed studies, including examinations of the dose and duration of treatment, are crucial for reaching definitive conclusions.","Manabe, Toshie; Kambayashi, Dan; Akatsu, Hiroyasu; Kudo, Koichiro",BMC Infect Dis,461,24

To minimise this, the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital NHS Foundation Trust elective surgery hub and the executive team at London Bridge Hospital (LBH) created an elective operating framework at LBH, a COVID-19 minimal site, in which patients self-isolated for two weeks and proceeded with surgery only following a negative preoperative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction swab. The aim was to determine the rates of rates of postoperative COVID-19 infection. METHODS: The collaboration involved three large hospital trusts, covering the geographic area of south-east London. All patients were referred to LBH for elective surgery. Patients were followed up by telephone interview at four weeks postoperatively. RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety-eight patients from 13 surgical specialties were included in the analysis. The median age was 60 (IQR 29-71) years. Sixty-three per cent (252/398) were female. In total, 78.4% of patients had an American Society of Anesthesiologists grade of 1-2 and the average BMI was 27.2 (IQR 23.7-31.8) kg/m2. Some 83.6% (336/402) were 'major' operations. The rate of COVID-19-related death in our cohort was 0.25% (1/398). Overall, there was a 1.26% (5/398) 30-day postoperative all-cause mortality rate. Seven patients (1.76%) reported COVID-19 symptoms, but none attended the emergency department or were readmitted to hospital as a result. CONCLUSION: The risk of contracting COVID-19 in our elective operating framework was very low. We demonstrate that high-volume major surgery is safe, even at the peak of the pandemic, if patients are screened appropriately preoperatively.","Chong, Smy; Hung, Rky; Gwozdz, A; Irwin, S; Eastbury, J; Cross, T; Ahmed, K; Taylor, C; Goldenberg, S D; Sanderson, J; Olsburgh, J",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,461,20

Neutrophils are known to contribute to immunopathology in infections, inflammatory diseases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Changes in neutrophil function in COVID-19 may give insight into disease pathogenesis and identify therapeutic targets. METHODS: Blood was obtained serially from critically ill COVID-19 patients for eleven days. Neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis), oxidative burst, phagocytosis and cytokine levels were assessed. Lung tissue was obtained immediately post-mortem for immunostaining. Pubmed searches for neutrophils, lung and COVID-19 yielded ten peer-reviewed research articles in English. RESULTS: Elevations in neutrophil-associated cytokines IL-8 and IL-6, and general inflammatory cytokines IP-10, GM-CSF, IL-1b, IL-10 and TNF, were identified both at first measurement and across hospitalization (p<0.0001). COVID neutrophils had exaggerated oxidative burst (p<0.0001), NETosis (p<0.0001) and phagocytosis (p<0.0001) relative to controls. Increased NETosis correlated with leukocytosis and neutrophilia, and neutrophils and NETs were identified within airways and alveoli in lung parenchyma of 40% of SARS-CoV-2 infected lungs available for examination (2 out of 5). While elevations in IL-8 and ANC correlated with disease severity, plasma IL-8 levels alone correlated with death. CONCLUSIONS: Literature to date demonstrates compelling evidence of increased neutrophils in the circulation and lungs of COVID-19 patients. importantly, neutrophil quantity and activation correlates with severity of disease. Similarly, our data shows that circulating neutrophils in COVID-19 exhibit an activated phenotype with enhanced NETosis and oxidative burst.","Masso-Silva, Jorge A; Moshensky, Alexander; Lam, Michael T Y; Odish, Mazen; Patel, Arjun; Xu, Le; Hansen, Emily; Trescott, Samantha; Nguyen, Celina; Kim, Roy; Perofsky, Katherine; Perera, Samantha; Ma, Lauren; Pham, Josephine; Rolfsen, Mark; Olay, Jarod; Shin, John; Dan, Jennifer M; Abbott, Robert; Ramirez, Sydney; Alexander, Thomas H; Lin, Grace Y; Fuentes, Ana Lucia; Advani, Ira; Gunge, Deepti; Pretorius, Victor; Malhotra, Atul; Sun, Xin; Duran, Jason; Hepokoski, Mark; Crotty, Shane; Coufal, Nicole G; Meier, Angela; Alexander, Laura E Crotty",Clin. infect. dis,461,22

RESULTS: The study comprised 243 patients, 107 during the lockdown period of 2020 and 136 during the same period in 2019, with no difference in demographics and clinical characteristics. Patients admitted in 2020 had higher admission and peak troponin levels, had a 2.4 fold greater likelihood of Door-to-balloon times> 90 min (95%CI: 1.2-4.9, p = 0.01) and 3.3 fold greater likelihood of pain-to-balloon times> 12 hours (OR 3.3, 95%CI: 1.3-8.1, p<0.01).

The S protein is a key virulence factor determining viral pathogenesis, host tropism, and disease pathogenesis. There are currently diverse corona viruses that are known to cause disease in humans. The occurrence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), as fatal human CoV diseases, has induced significant interest in the medical field. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a novel strain of coronavirus (SAR-CoV-2). The SARSCoV2 outbreak has been evolved in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and identified as a pandemic on March 2020 resulting in 53.24 M cases and 1.20M deaths worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 main proteinase (MPro), a key protease of CoV-2, mediates viral replication and transcription. SARS-CoV-2 MPro has been emerged as an attractive target for SARS-CoV-2 drug design and development. Diverse scaffolds have been released targeting SARS-CoV-2 MPro. In this review, we culminate the latest published information about SARS-CoV-2 main proteinase (MPro) and reported inhibitors.","Sabbah, Dima A; Hajjo, Rima; Bardaweel, Sanaa K; Zhong, Haizhen A",Curr. top. med. chem,461,25

We measured the rate of enzyme-free hydrolysis for 17 phosphoramidates of ribonucleotides with amino acids or related compounds at pH 7.5. Phosphoramidates of proline hydrolyzed fast, with a half-life time as short as 2.4 h for Pro-AMP in ethylimidazole-containing buffer at 37 °C; 45-fold faster than Ala-AMP and 120-fold faster than Phe-AMP.

AIM: The aim of this study is to assess the impact of COVID-19 on total mortality of Poland and the Silesian voivodship. METHODS: Secondary epidemiological data on COVID-19 deaths were obtained from the Ministry of Health registry and data on total mortality were gathered from the National Statistical Office and Registry Office in Poland. Three scenarios were used to estimated COVID-19 deaths: real number + an extra 30%, 60%, and 70% excess total deaths. RESULTS: In 2020, there were 73,254, 64,584, and 67,677 excess deaths in comparison to 2017-2019, respectively. For the Silesian voivodship, it was 8339, 7946, and 8701, respectively. The total mean increase in deaths was 16% for the whole country and the Silesian voivodship. The simulation for 30% extra COVID-19 deaths gave COVID-19 mortality equal to 12.5%;n = 50,708 deaths, for extra 60%;17.9% n = 72,866 and for extra 70%;19.7% n = 80,251 for Poland;and 11.9% (n = 6072), 17.2% (n = 8740), 24.2% (n = 12,297), respectively, for the Silesian voivodship.

To create a tool to rapidly determine where pandemic demand for critical care overwhelms county-level surge capacity and to compare public health and medical responses.Methods. In March 2020, COVID-19 cases requiring critical care were estimated using an adaptive metapopulation SEIR (susceptibleâexposedâinfectiousârecovered) model for all 3142 US counties for future 21-day and 42-day periods from April 2, 2020, to May 13, 2020, in 4 reactive patterns of contact reduction-0%, 20%, 30%, and 40%-and 4 surge response scenarios-very low, low, medium, and high.Results. In areas with increased demand, surge response measures could avert 104 120 additional deaths-55% through high clearance of critical care beds and 45% through measures such as greater ventilator access. The percentages of lives saved from high levels of contact reduction were 1.9 to 4.2 times greater than high levels of hospital surge response. Differences in projected versus actual COVID-19 demands were reasonably small over time.Conclusions. Nonpharmaceutical public health interventions had greater impact in minimizing preventable deaths during the pandemic than did hospital critical care surge response.

We compared the outcomes of 'elderly' patients presenting to our unit with a colorectal cancer emergency over a 10-year period with those of a 'younger' cohort. METHODS: A single centre retrospective review of colorectal cancer emergencies between 1 April 2007 and 1 April 2017 was performed. Patients were separated into two cohorts: 'young' (< 75 years) and 'elderly' (&#8805; 75 years). Data collected included demographics, disease status, treatment and outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 341 patients (< 75 years: n = 154; &#8805; 75 years: n = 187) presented as a colorectal cancer emergency. Significantly fewer 'elderly' patients underwent curative surgical procedures (72% vs 49%, P < 0.0001) or received adjuvant chemotherapy (56% vs 21%, P < 0.0001). 'Elderly' patients had significantly more postoperative cardio-respiratory complications (7% vs 36%, P < 0.0001), but despite this there was no significant difference in 30-day mortality (7% vs 12%) and survival rates at 1 year (75% vs 74%) or 3 years (56% vs 49%). Elderly patients treated with best supportive care had a median overall survival of just 62 (range 1-955) days. CONCLUSION: Patients &#8805; 75 years presenting as a colorectal cancer emergency were significantly less likely to undergo emergency curative surgery or receive adjuvant chemotherapy than those < 75 years.

Since its outset, efforts have been made to guide the rapid generation of research in medicine. There are gaps in some areas of rehabilitation research for patients with COVID-19. The development of a specific research framework might serve to help monitor the status of research (mapping), shape and strengthen research by pointing to under-investigated areas, and promote rehabilitation research in this context. This paper introduces and discusses the COVID-19 Rehabilitation Research Framework (CRRF) and presents the methodology used for its development. The questions have been developed among the World Health Organization Rehabilitation Programme, Cochrane Rehabilitation and the experts of its REH-COVER (Rehabilitation - COVID-19 Evidence-based Response) Action International Multiprofessional Steering Committee. The framework is divided into two parts and includes 20 questions organized in four groups: epidemiology, and evidence at the micro- (individual), meso- (health services) and macro- (health systems) level. The CRRF offers a comprehensive view of the research areas relevant to COVID-19 and rehabilitation that are necessary to inform best practice and ensure rehabilitation services and health systems can best serve the COVID-19 population. The collaboration between Cochrane Rehabilitation and the WHO Rehabilitation Programme in establishing the CRRF brought together perspectives from the health systems, health management and clinical evidence. The authors encourage researchers to use the CRRF when planning studies on rehabilitation in the context of COVID-19.","Negrini, Stefano; Mills, Jody-Anne; Arienti, Chiara; Kiekens, Carlotte; Cieza, Alarcos",Arch. phys. med. rehabil,461,29

We also quantify the impact of misclassification error bias on publicly reported case data in Maryland. Using a stratified random sampling approach, 50,000 individuals were selected from a simulated Maryland population to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19. We examined the situation when the true prevalence is low (0.07%-2%), medium (2%-5%) and high (6%-10%). Bayesian models informed by published validity estimates were used to account for misclassification error when estimating COVID-19 prevalence. Adjustment for misclassification error captured the true prevalence 100% of the time, irrespective of the true prevalence level. When adjustment for misclassification error was not done, the results highly varied depending on the population's underlying true prevalence and the type of diagnostic test used. Generally, the prevalence estimates without adjustment for misclassification error worsened as the true prevalence level increased. Adjustment for misclassification error for publicly reported Maryland data led to a minimal but not significant increase in the estimated average daily cases.

However, CPFs can be inefficient or difficult to apply with diffuse initial distributions, which are common in statistical applications. We propose a simple but generally applicable auxiliary variable method, which can be used together with the CPF in order to perform efficient inference with diffuse initial distributions. The method only requires simulatable Markov transitions that are reversible with respect to the initial distribution, which can be improper. We focus in particular on random-walk type transitions which are reversible with respect to a uniform initial distribution (on some domain), and autoregressive kernels for Gaussian initial distributions. We propose to use on-line adaptations within the methods. In the case of random-walk transition, our adaptations use the estimated covariance and acceptance rate adaptation, and we detail their theoretical validity. We tested our methods with a linear-Gaussian random-walk model, a stochastic volatility model, and a stochastic epidemic compartment model with time-varying transmission rate. The experimental findings demonstrate that our method works reliably with little user specification, and can be substantially better mixing than a direct particle Gibbs algorithm that treats initial states as parameters.","Karppinen, Santeri; Vihola, Matti",,461,26

Although coronavirus disease (COVID-19) clinical manifestations are mainly respiratory, major cardiac complications are being reported. Cardiac manifestations etiology seems to be multifactorial, comprising direct viral myocardial damage, hypoxia, hypotension, enhanced inflammatory status, ACE2-receptors downregulation, drug toxicity, endogenous catecholamine adrenergic status, among others. Studies evaluating patients with COVID-19 presenting cardiac injury markers show that it is associated with poorer outcomes, and arrhythmic events are not uncommon. Besides, drugs currently used to treat the COVID-19 are known to prolong the QT interval and can have a proarrhythmic propensity. This review focus on COVID-19 cardiac and arrhythmic manifestations and, in parallel, makes an appraisal of other virus epidemics as SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and H1N1 influenza.","Kochi, Adriano Nunes; Tagliari, Ana Paula; Forleo, Giovanni Battista; Fassini, Gaetano Michele; Tondo, Claudio",J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol,461,2

The disease can lead to serious problems, like pneumonia or even death especially among vulnerable people with existing health conditions. Its treatment and management require huge efforts from medical professionals often at the cost of their own health and life. Nutrition is the epicenter for the management of such diseases which works synergistically with the medical treatment for quick and better recovery. It has been associated with great human and economic toll and it is still not contained. Currently over two million people are affected and over 300,000 deaths globally. However, due to its newness and unfamiliarity, the understanding of this novel virus is still evolving. This viral infection poses numerous metabolic challenges to those severely affected and addressing them is a key to better outcomes. Medical nutritional therapy is thus among the mainstay of core components of comprehensive treatment measures for patients with COVID-19. This manuscript therefore aims to highlight the role of nutritional management and support in covid-19 disease.","Gupta, Lovely; Jalang039,; o, Grace Atieno; Gupta, Piyush",J Pak Med Assoc,461,16

METHODS: The first case of COVID-19 in our country was seen on March 11th, 2020. The patients operated between March 11th, 2019-and March 10th, 2020 were taken as the pre-COVID group, and those operated between March 11th and May 11th, 2020 were taken as the COVID group. The data was retrospectively collected, and the two periods were compared. RESULTS: Monthly average number of cases which was 52 patients/month (626 patients in 12 months) before COVID decreased to 35 patients/month (70 patients in 2 months) during COVID periods (P < .01). During the pre-COVID period the median postoperative length of hospital stay was 3 (IQR: 1-5) days. During the COVID period, this decreased to 1 (IQR: 1-3) day (P < .01). During the pre-COVID period, the hospital expenses of 17% (8/47) of the foreign nationals were covered by their homeland. The remaining 83% (39/47) were paid from the asylum seekers' fund. The proportion of foreign nationals operated significantly decreased during the COVID period ([7%; 47/632 vs 1%; 1/70]; P = .04). No significant difference was observed in terms of STAT mortality scores and categories and postoperative results of the operations performed between the two periods. CONCLUSIONS: Congenital cardiac surgery practice can be safely maintained with restricted case volume during the pandemic period. It is alarming that patients in the deprived areas cannot access pediatric cardiac surgery and possibly other health services because of closure of the borders between countries.","Korun, Oktay; Yurdakök, Okan; Arslan, Akin; Çiçek, Murat; Selçuk, Arif; Kiliç, Yigit; Altin, Firat; Sasmazel, Ahmet; Aydemir, Numan Ali",J. card. surg,461,15

METHODS: Three electronic databases including PubMed, Science Direct and Google Scholar were searched to identify relevant cohort studies of COVID-19 disease from January 1, 2020, to August 11, 2020. A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled prevalence rate (PR), risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for both effect measures. Cochrane chi-square test statistic Q, [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] tests were used to measure the presence of heterogeneity. Publication bias and sensitivity of the included studies were also tested. RESULTS: In this meta-analysis, a total of 58 studies with 122,191 patients were analyzed. The pooled prevalence rate of mortality among the hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 18.88%, 95% CI (16.46-21.30), p < 0.001. Highest mortality was found in Europe [PR 26.85%, 95% CI (19.41-34.29), p < 0.001] followed by North America [PR 21.47%, 95% CI (16.27-26.68), p < 0.001] and Asia [PR 14.83%, 95% CI (12.46- 17.21), p < 0.001]. An significant association were found between mortality among COVID-19 infected patients and older age (> 65 years vs. < 65 years) [RR 3.59, 95% CI (1.87-6.90), p < 0.001], gender (male vs. female) [RR 1.63, 95% CI (1.43-1.87), p < 0.001], ICU admitted patients [RR 3.72, 95% CI (2.70-5.13), p < 0.001], obesity [RR 2.18, 95% CI (1.10-4.34), p < 0.05], hypertension [RR 2.08,95% CI (1.79-2.43) p < 0.001], diabetes [RR 1.87, 95% CI (1.23-2.84), p < 0.001], cardiovascular disease [RR 2.51, 95% CI (1.20-5.26), p < 0.05], and cancer [RR 2.31, 95% CI (1.80-2.97), p < 0.001]. In addition, significant association for high risk of mortality were also found for cerebrovascular disease, COPD, coronary heart disease, chronic renal disease, chronic liver disease, chronic lung disease and chronic kidney disease. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis revealed that the mortality rate among COVID-19 patients was highest in the European region and older age, gender, ICU patients, patients with comorbidity had a high risk for case fatality. Those findings would help the health care providers to reduce the mortality rate and combat this pandemic to save lives using limited resources.","Noor, Farha Musharrat; Islam, Md Momin",J Community Health,461,16

Poor needle tip visualization has been cited for USGPIV failure. Twinkle artifact (TA), visualized with color Doppler, is used in other clinical settings. Our objective was to investigate whether teaching students USGPIV placement utilizing TA would enhance needle tip visualization and improve first pass success. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized study of premedical and preclinical medical students without prior USGPIV experience. Students were given a standardized didactic session on USGPIV placement before being randomized and separated to learn and practice USGPIV with or without TA (control). The students were given 5 min to perform USGPIV on phantom models. The primary outcome was the rate of first pass success. Secondary outcomes included total time to cannulation, rate of posterior venous wall puncture, and total number of attempts. RESULTS: Rates of first pass success were similar in both the TA (82%) and control groups (57%), p = 0.095. There was a difference in the mean time to cannulation. The TA group achieved success at 50.76 s (SD 26.93) while the control group achieved success at 85.30 s (SD 65.47), p = 0.048. CONCLUSION: In this study of utilizing TA to aid in USGPIV placement, students were able to achieve successful cannulation in a shorter amount of time. There was no significant difference in first pass success. Future studies should utilize a larger sample size and evaluate the utility of TA when placing USGPIV on patients.","Gardecki, Jeffrey; Hughes, Liam P; Zakaria, Saami; Lewiss, Resa E; Goodsell, Kelly; Risler, Zachary; Chang, Anna Marie; Shughart, Hailey; Norton, Kyle; Au, Arthur",J Vasc Access,461,6

Entry of coronaviruses into host cells is mediated by the spike (S) protein. In our previous ESR studies, the local membrane ordering effect of the fusion peptide (FP) of various viral glycoproteins including the S of SARS-1 and MERS has been consistently observed. We previously determined that the sequence immediately downstream from the S2' cleavage site is the bona fide SARS-1 FP. In this study, we used sequence alignment to identify the SARS-2 FP, and studied its membrane ordering effect. Although there are only three residue differences, SARS-2 FP induces even greater membrane ordering than SARS-1 FP, possibly due to its greater hydrophobicity. This may be a reason that SARS-2 is better able to infect host cells. In addition, the membrane binding enthalpy for SARS-2 is greater. Both the membrane ordering of SARS-2 and SARS-1 FPs are dependent on Ca2+, but that of SARS-2 shows a greater response to the presence of Ca2+. Both FPs bind two Ca2+ ions as does SARS-1 FP, but the two Ca2+ binding sites of SARS-2 exhibit greater cooperativity. This Ca2+ dependence by the SARS-2 FP is very ion-specific. These results show that Ca2+ is an important regulator that interacts with the SARS-2 FP and thus plays a significant role in SARS-2 viral entry. This could lead to therapeutic solutions that either target the FP-calcium interaction or block the Ca2+ channel.","Lai, Alex L; Freed, Jack H",J Mol Biol,461,11

In the present study, we used the COVIDSeq protocol, which involves multiplex-PCR, barcoding, and sequencing of samples for high-throughput detection and deciphering the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. We used the approach on 752 clinical samples in duplicates, amounting to a total of 1536 samples which could be sequenced on a single S4 sequencing flow cell on NovaSeq 6000. Our analysis suggests a high concordance between technical duplicates and a high concordance of detection of SARS-CoV-2 between the COVIDSeq as well as RT-PCR approaches. An in-depth analysis revealed a total of six samples in which COVIDSeq detected SARS-CoV-2 in high confidence which were negative in RT-PCR. Additionally, the assay could detect SARS-CoV-2 in 21 samples and 16 samples which were classified inconclusive and pan-sarbeco positive respectively suggesting that COVIDSeq could be used as a confirmatory test. The sequencing approach also enabled insights into the evolution and genetic epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 samples. The samples were classified into a total of 3 clades. This study reports two lineages B.1.112 and B.1.99 for the first time in India. This study also revealed 1,143 unique single nucleotide variants and added a total of 73 novel variants identified for the first time.

However, targeted synthesis of zeolites with new pore structures and compositions remains a key challenge. Here, we propose an approach based on a unique 3D-3D topotactic transformation, which takes advantage of weak bonding in zeolites. This is inspired by the structure transformation of PST-5, a new aluminophosphate molecular sieve, to PST-6 by calcination. The structure of nano-sized PST-5 crystals is determined by 3D electron diffraction. We find that the 3D-3D topotactic transformation involves two types of building units where penta- or hexa-coordinated Al is present. We apply this approach to several other zeolite systems and predict a series of new zeolite structures that would be synthetically feasible. This method provides a concept for the synthesis of targeted zeolites, especially those which may not be feasible by conventional methods.","Huang, Zhehao; Seo, Seungwan; Shin, Jiho; Wang, Bin; Bell, Robert G; Hong, Suk Bong; Zou, Xiaodong",Nat Commun,461,1

Although vaccination process has already started, reaching sufficient availability will take time. Considering the impact of this widespread disease, many research attempts have been made by the computer scientists to screen the COVID-19 from Chest X-Rays (CXRs) or Computed Tomography (CT) scans. To this end, we have proposed GraphCovidNet, a Graph Isomorphic Network (GIN) based model which is used to detect COVID-19 from CT-scans and CXRs of the affected patients. Our proposed model only accepts input data in the form of graph as we follow a GIN based architecture. Initially, pre-processing is performed to convert an image data into an undirected graph to consider only the edges instead of the whole image. Our proposed GraphCovidNet model is evaluated on four standard datasets: SARS-COV-2 Ct-Scan dataset, COVID-CT dataset, combination of covid-chestxray-dataset, Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset and CMSC-678-ML-Project dataset. The model shows an impressive accuracy of 99% for all the datasets and its prediction capability becomes 100% accurate for the binary classification problem of detecting COVID-19 scans.

Here, we developed and validated a practical model based on the data from a multi-center cohort in China for early identification and prediction of which patients will be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Data of 1087 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were collected from 49 sites between January 2 and February 28, 2020, in Sichuan and Wuhan. Patients were randomly categorized into the training and validation cohorts (7:3). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and logistic regression analyzes were used to develop the nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated for the C-index, calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness. Further, the nomogram was externally validated in a different cohort. RESULTS: The individualized prediction nomogram included 6 predictors: age, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, smoking status, fever, and chronic kidney disease. The model demonstrated a high discriminative ability in the training cohort (C-index = 0.829), which was confirmed in the external validation cohort (C-index = 0.776). In addition, the calibration plots confirmed good concordance for predicting the risk of ICU admission. Decision curve analysis revealed that the prediction nomogram was clinically useful. CONCLUSION: We established an early prediction model incorporating clinical characteristics that could be quickly obtained on hospital admission, even in community health centers. This model can be conveniently used to predict the individual risk for ICU admission of patients with COVID-19 and optimize the use of limited resources.","Zhou, Yiwu; He, Yanqi; Yang, Huan; Yu, He; Wang, Ting; Chen, Zhu; Yao, Rong; Liang, Zongan",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,461,16

METHODS: This is a prospective descriptive study of 100 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, randomly sampled, from February to March 2020. Demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory findings were analyzed according to the olfactory loss or sinonasal symptoms. The olfactory impairment and sinonasal symptoms were evaluated by 9 Likert scale questions asked from the patients. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients completed the follow-up (means 20.1 (± 7.42) days). Twenty-two (23.91%) patients complained of olfactory loss and in 6 (6.52%) patients olfactory loss was the first symptom of the disease. The olfactory loss was reported to be completely resolved in all but one patient. Thirty-nine (42.39%) patients had notable sinonasal symptoms while rhinorrhea was the first symptom in 3 (3.26%).

Participants were shown static facial expressions (Angry, Happy and Neutral) covered by a sanitary mask or by a scarf. They were asked to evaluate the expressed emotions as well as to assess the degree to which one would adopt physical and social distancing measures for each stimulus. Results demonstrate that, despite the covering of the lower-face, participants correctly recognized the facial expressions of emotions with a polarizing effect on emotional valence ratings found in females. Noticeably, while females' ratings for physical and social distancing were driven by the emotional content of the stimuli, males were influenced by the ""covered"" condition.

Objectives: In this article, we reviewed the varied neuroimaging patterns in patients with COVID-19-associated neurological complications. Methods: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus and preprint databases (medRxiv and bioRxiv). The search terms we used were ""COVID -19 and encephalitis, encephalopathy, neuroimaging or neuroradiology"" and ""SARS-CoV-2 and encephalitis, encephalopathy, neuroimaging or neuroradiology"". Results: Neuroimaging abnormalities are common in old age and patients with comorbidities. Neuroimaging abnormalities are largely vascular in origin. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy results in large vessel occlusion and cerebral venous thrombosis. COVID-19-associated intracerebral hemorrhage resembles anticoagulant associated intracerebral hemorrhage. On neuroimaging, hypoxic-ischemic damage along with hyperimmune reaction against the SARS-COV-2 virus manifests as small vessel disease. Small vessel disease appears as diffuse leukoencephalopathy and widespread microbleeds, and subcortical white matter hyperintensities. Occasionally, gray matter hyperintensity, similar to those observed seen in autoimmune encephalitis, has been noted. In many cases, white matter lesions similar to that in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis have been described. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in COVID-19 seems to be a parainfectious event and autoimmune in origin. Many cases of acute necrotizing encephalitis resulting in extensive damage to thalamus and brain stem have been described; cytokine storm has been considered a pathogenic mechanism behind this. None of the neuroimaging abnormalities can provide a clue to the possible pathogenic mechanism.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in South Korea and evaluate whether a social distancing campaign is effective in mitigating the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: We used contract tracing data to investigate the epidemic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in South Korea and evaluate whether a social distancing campaign was effective in mitigating the spread of COVID-19. We calculated the mortality rate for COVID-19 by infection type (cluster vs noncluster) and tested whether new confirmed COVID-19 trends changed after a social distancing campaign. RESULTS: There were 2537 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who completed the epidemiologic survey: 1305 (51.4%) cluster cases and 1232 (48.6%) noncluster cases. The mortality rate was significantly higher in cluster cases linked to medical facilities (11/143, 7.70% vs 5/1232, 0.41%; adjusted percentage difference 7.99%; 95% CI 5.83 to 10.14) and long-term care facilities (19/221, 8.60% vs 5/1232, 0.41%; adjusted percentage difference 7.56%; 95% CI 5.66 to 9.47) than in noncluster cases. The change in trends of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases before and after the social distancing campaign was significantly negative in the entire cohort (adjusted trend difference -2.28; 95% CI -3.88 to -0.68) and the cluster infection group (adjusted trend difference -0.96; 95% CI -1.83 to -0.09). CONCLUSIONS: In a nationwide contact tracing study in South Korea, COVID-19 linked to medical and long-term care facilities significantly increased the risk of mortality compared to noncluster COVID-19. A social distancing campaign decreased the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea and differentially affected cluster infections of SARS-CoV-2.","Lee, Seung Won; Yuh, Woon Tak; Yang, Jee Myung; Cho, Yoon-Sik; Yoo, In Kyung; Koh, Hyun Yong; Marshall, Dominic; Oh, Donghwan; Ha, Eun Kyo; Han, Man Yong; Yon, Dong Keon",JMIR Med Inform,461,20

This messaging enables the U.S. Department of Agriculture to track and respond to high-consequence animal disease outbreaks such as highly pathogenic avian influenza. Because of the lack of standardized data collection in the LIMSs used at VDLs, there is, to date, no means of summarizing VDL large data streams for multi-state and national animal health studies or for providing near-real-time tracking for hundreds of other important animal diseases in the United States that are detected routinely by VDLs.

The CSF of Neuro-COVID patients exhibited an expansion of dedifferentiated monocytes and of exhausted CD4+ T cells. Neuro-COVID CSF leukocytes featured an enriched interferon signature; however, this was less pronounced than in viral encephalitis. Repertoire analysis revealed broad clonal T cell expansion and curtailed interferon response in severe compared with mild Neuro-COVID patients.

Por outro lado a fasciolose, também considerada uma zoonose, possui uma menor ocorrência quando comparada à cisticercose, fato que pode estar atribuído a sua dinâmica epidemiológica. Visando conhecer o nível de infecção destas zoonoses no rebanho bovino goiano, realizou-se este trabalho com o objetivo de determinar a prevalência e a distribuição espacial, além de avaliar a associação de algumas variáveis epidemiológicas com a ocorrência destas enfermidades nos animais e estimar as perdas econômicas causadas aos produtores e indústrias. Foi realizado um estudo do tipo retrospectivo referente a um total de 23.255.979 animais abatidos agrupados por ano, mesorregiões e microrregiões de Goiás.

DESIGN: Quantitative analysis of resident-level assessment data. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Long-stay residents living in Connecticut nursing homes. METHODS: We used Minimum Data Set assessments to measure nursing home resident outcomes observed in each week between March and July 2020 for long-stay residents (eg, those in the nursing home for at least 100 days) who lived in a nursing home at the beginning of the pandemic. We compared outcomes to those observed at the beginning of the pandemic, controlling for both resident characteristics and patterns for outcomes observed in 2017-2019. RESULTS: We found that nursing home resident outcomes worsened on a broad array of measures. The prevalence of depressive symptoms increased by 6 percentage points relative to before the pandemic in the beginning of March-representing a 15% increase. The share of residents with unplanned substantial weight loss also increased by 6 percentage points relative to the beginning of March-representing a 150% increase. We also found significant increases in episodes of incontinence (4 percentage points) and significant reductions in cognitive functioning. Our findings suggest that loneliness and isolation play an important role. Though unplanned substantial weight loss was greatest for those who contracted COVID-19 (about 10% of residents observed in each week), residents who did not contract COVID-19 also physically deteriorated (about 7.5% of residents in each week). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These analyses show that the pandemic had substantial impacts on nursing home residents beyond what can be quantified by cases and deaths, adversely affecting the physical and emotional well-being of residents. Future policy changes to limit the spread of COVID-19 or other infectious disease outbreaks should consider any additional costs beyond the direct effects of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19.","Levere, Michael; Rowan, Patricia; Wysocki, Andrea",J Am Med Dir Assoc,461,26

Tocilizumab (TCZ) was administered to these subjects, despite the lack of randomised clinical trial data. Hence, summarising data on the mortality rate and related risks factors may help physicians to correctly administer TCZ. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on mortality rate in TCZ- treated patients with COVID-19 according to the PRISMA guidelines. The pooled mortality rate in TCZ-treated persons was calculated and meta-regressions were done to investigate associated factors. RESULTS: We included 22 studies and 1520 TCZ-treated patients (mean age: 61 years, 95% CI: 59-64; male: 71%, 95% CI: 64-78%). The mortality estimated pooled prevalence was 19% (95% CI: 13-25, I2=100%, p<0.00001) and improvement estimated pooled prevalence was 71% (95% CI: 62-81). Factors associated with the mortality are the number of patients in intensive care unit, the number of patients requiring invasive ventilation and the sera C-reactive protein value before TCZ administration. We observed a reduction in the odds of mortality in TCZ-treated patients when compared to those treated with other therapies (OR=0.47, 95% CI: 0.22-0.98, p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the mortality pooled prevalence in TCZ-treated patients is lower than the overall mortality reported in patients with severe COVID-19.","Berardicurti, Onorina; Ruscitti, Piero; Ursini, Francesco; D039,; Andrea, Settimio; Ciaffi, Jacopo; Meliconi, Riccardo; Iagnocco, Annamaria; Cipriani, Paola; Giacomelli, Roberto",Clin Exp Rheumatol,461,14

Previously, we demonstrated that asymmetric, phosphorothioate (PS)-modified, chemically stabilized, cholesterol-conjugated siRNAs, called hsiRNAs, support rapid cellular uptake and efficient mRNA silencing both in cultured cells and in vivo. Here, we systematically evaluated the impact of number, structure, and sequence context of PS-modified backbones on cellular uptake and RNAi-mediated silencing efficacy. We find that PS enhances cellular internalization in a sequence-dependent manner but only when present in a single-stranded but not double-stranded region. Furthermore, the observed increase in cellular internalization did not correlate with functional silencing improvement, indicating that PS-mediated uptake may drive compounds to non-productive sinks. Thus, the primary contributing factor of PS modifications to functional efficacy is likely stabilization rather than enhanced cellular uptake. A better understanding of the relative impact of different chemistries on productive versus non-productive uptake will assist in improved design of therapeutic RNAs.","Ly, Socheata; Echeverria, Dimas; Sousa, Jacquelyn; Khvorova, Anastasia",Mol Ther Nucleic Acids,461,24

We used open questions to examine challenges experienced and solutions implemented during the early pandemic and chose qualitative content analysis to extract and describe the meaning of the answers. We derived deductive categories from the research questions and formed inductive categories during the material reviews. Results: Main challenges were: insufficient information, lack of protective equipment, need to restructure practice procedures and insufficient individual and structural pandemic preparedness, resulting in secondary challenges: fear of infection, impaired patient care, aggravated steering of patients, difficult cooperation with external entities and a not viable hygiene concept advised by authorities. Strategies to address these challenges included establishing regular team-meetings to develop new solutions, focusing on few reliable sources of information, working in alternating shifts, increasing telemedicine, establishing window and open-air practices and building networks with other health care providers. Respondents criticized the lack of consideration of their experiences in planning pandemic measures within primary care. Conclusions: General practitioners successfully applied pragmatic and creative strategies in their practices during the early phase of the pandemic. Among these, communication within and between practices emerged as a key strategy. These strategies should be provided with pandemic preparedness plans.

METHODS: We included all patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who had completed hospitalization between March 10, 2020 and April 10, 2020 with follow-up through April 20, 2020. Patients who received TCB in addition to standard of care within 48 h of admission were matched in a 1:2 fashion to a similar cohort who received standard of care alone. Clinical outcomes were compared between matched groups. The primary outcome was de-escalation in oxygen therapy. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital death, septic shock, and acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring hemodialysis. RESULTS: Out of 77 patients who received TCB in addition to standard of care, 34% (n = 26) received TCB within 48 h of admission.

We estimated the real-world effectiveness of two doses of BNT162b2 against a range of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes and to evaluate the nationwide public-health impact following the widespread introduction of the vaccine. METHODS: We used national surveillance data from the first 4 months of the nationwide vaccination campaign to ascertain incident cases of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and outcomes, as well as vaccine uptake in residents of Israel aged 16 years and older. Vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 outcomes (asymptomatic infection, symptomatic infection, and COVID-19-related hospitalisation, severe or critical hospitalisation, and death) was calculated on the basis of incidence rates in fully vaccinated individuals (defined as those for whom 7 days had passed since receiving the second dose of vaccine) compared with rates in unvaccinated individuals (who had not received any doses of the vaccine), with use of a negative binomial regression model adjusted for age group (16-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, and &#8805;85 years), sex, and calendar week. The proportion of spike gene target failures on PCR test among a nationwide convenience-sample of SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens was used to estimate the prevelance of the B.1.1.7 variant. FINDINGS: During the analysis period (Jan 24 to April 3, 2021), there were 232 268 SARS-CoV-2 infections, 7694 COVID-19 hospitalisations, 4481 severe or critical COVID-19 hospitalisations, and 1113 COVID-19 deaths in people aged 16 years or older. By April 3, 2021, 4 714 932 (72·1%) of 6 538 911 people aged 16 years and older were fully vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2. Adjusted estimates of vaccine effectiveness at 7 days or longer after the second dose were 95·3% (95% CI 94·9-95·7; incidence rate 91·5 per 100 000 person-days in unvaccinated vs 3·1 per 100 000 person-days in fully vaccinated individuals) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 91·5% (90·7-92·2; 40·9 vs 1·8 per 100 000 person-days) against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, 97·0% (96·7-97·2; 32·5 vs 0·8 per 100 000 person-days) against symptomatic COVID-19, 97·2% (96·8-97·5; 4·6 vs 0·3 per 100 000 person-days) against COVID-19-related hospitalisation, 97·5% (97·1-97·8; 2·7 vs 0·2 per 100 000 person-days) against severe or critical COVID-19-related hospitalisation, and 96·7% (96·0-97·3; 0·6 vs 0·1 per 100 000 person-days) against COVID-19-related death. In all age groups, as vaccine coverage increased, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes declined. 8006 of 8472 samples tested showed a spike gene target failure, giving an estimated prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant of 94·5% among SARS-CoV-2 infections. INTERPRETATION: Two doses of BNT162b2 are highly effective across all age groups (&#8805;16 years, including older adults aged &#8805;85 years) in preventing symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospitalisations, severe disease, and death, including those caused by the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant. There were marked and sustained declines in SARS-CoV-2 incidence corresponding to increasing vaccine coverage. These findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination can help to control the pandemic.

Unfortunately, prolonged viral RNA shedding frequently hinders transplantation. Recent data reveal that positive test results for viral genome are frequently due to noninfectious and prolonged convalescent shedding of viral genome. Moreover, studies demonstrated that the cycle threshold of quantitative RT-PCR could be leveraged to inform clinical transplant decision-making. We present an evidence-adjusted and significantly less restrictive policy for LT, where risk tolerance is tiered to recipient acuity. In addition, we delineate the pretransplant clinical decision-making, intra- and postoperative management, and early outcome of 2 recipients of a liver graft performed while their RT-PCR of airway swabs remained positive.

We, then examined, retrospectively and prospectively, the clinical course during hospitalization by performing serial examinations of serum SARS-CoV-2 RNA status. The findings from our cases suggest that not only is detection of viremia useful as a predictive marker of severity, but also serial serum SARS-CoV-2 RNA results can be helpful for predicting the clinical course.","Kodama, Tatsuya; Kouzaki, Yuji; Kawano, Shuichi; Obinata, Hirofumi; Taniguchi, Hiroaki; Sasaki, Hisashi; Ota, Shinichiro; Kawana, Akihiko; Tamura, Kaku",J Infect Chemother,461,16

In order to develop new insights on the immune-based treatments against this disease, it is vital to understand the immunopathology of the COVID-19, implications of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and immune dysfunction in response to SARS-CoV-2. There is no approved drug for the treatment of COVID-19. It is, thus, promising to design immune-based treatments that inhibit the infectious mechanism of the virus, improve the inadequate immune response, or regulate the hyperactivated immune response in severely ill patients. According to the antiviral immune response against the virus, antibody-based immunotherapies of COVID-19 include injection of convalescent plasma from recovered patients, high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), monoclonal antibodies, and polyclonal antibodies. Also, cell-based treatment, vaccine-based approaches, cytokine-based immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, decoy receptors, and immunosuppressive drugs are discussed in this chapter.","Esmaeilzadeh, Abdolreza; Jafari, Davood; Tahmasebi, Safa; Elahi, Reza; Khosh, Elnaz",Adv Exp Med Biol,461,26

Video consultations were introduced in March 2020, and this article presents the experiences gained by healthcare professionals and patients. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The data was collected in June 2020 through focus-group interviews with healthcare professionals and through an anonymous online survey of patients who had attended video consultations during a period of three weeks in June 2020. RESULTS: The data from the focus-group interviews with seven rheumatologists and seven nurses were sorted into main thematic categories: patient, healthcare professional, consultation, and technology. The healthcare professionals felt that video consultations, with some exceptions, were appropriate in the follow-up of patients with rheumatic diseases, and especially for stable patients with no confounding issues. Of the 383 patients who were invited to participate, 139 (36 %) responded to the survey. The patients were largely satisfied with the video consultation, with a median score of 10 (quartiles 8-10) on a numerical rating scale from 0 to 10, however, 32 (27 %) patients considered the lack of clinical examination to be detrimental.

The first nontravel-related U.S. case was confirmed on February 26 in a California resident who had become ill on February 13 (3). Two days later, on February 28, a second nontravel-related case was confirmed in the state of Washington (4,5). Examination of four lines of evidence provides insight into the timing of introduction and early transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, into the United States before the detection of these two cases. First, syndromic surveillance based on emergency department records from counties affected early by the pandemic did not show an increase in visits for COVID-19-like illness before February 28. Second, retrospective SARS-CoV-2 testing of approximately 11,000 respiratory specimens from several U.S. locations beginning January 1 identified no positive results before February 20. Third, analysis of viral RNA sequences from early cases suggested that a single lineage of virus imported directly or indirectly from China began circulating in the United States between January 18 and February 9, followed by several SARS-CoV-2 importations from Europe. Finally, the occurrence of three cases, one in a California resident who died on February 6, a second in another resident of the same county who died February 17, and a third in an unidentified passenger or crew member aboard a Pacific cruise ship that left San Francisco on February 11, confirms cryptic circulation of the virus by early February. These data indicate that sustained, community transmission had begun before detection of the first two nontravel-related U.S. cases, likely resulting from the importation of a single lineage of virus from China in late January or early February, followed by several importations from Europe. The widespread emergence of COVID-19 throughout the United States after February highlights the importance of robust public health systems to respond rapidly to emerging infectious threats.","Jorden, Michelle A; Rudman, Sarah L; Villarino, Elsa; Hoferka, Stacey; Patel, Megan T; Bemis, Kelley; Simmons, Cristal R; Jespersen, Megan; Iberg Johnson, Jenna; Mytty, Elizabeth; Arends, Katherine D; Henderson, Justin J; Mathes, Robert W; Weng, Charlene X; Duchin, Jeffrey; Lenahan, Jennifer; Close, Natasha; Bedford, Trevor; Boeckh, Michael; Chu, Helen Y; Englund, Janet A; Famulare, Michael; Nickerson, Deborah A; Rieder, Mark J; Shendure, Jay; Starita, Lea M",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,461,26

This report outlines the rationale and functionality of the PyRoss library, with various illustrations and examples focusing on well-mixed, age-structured populations. The PyRoss library supports arbitrary structured models formulated stochastically (as master equations) or deterministically (as ODEs) and allows mid-run transitioning from one to the other. By supporting additional compartmental subdivision ad libitum, PyRoss can emulate time-since-infection models and allows medical stages such as hospitalization or quarantine to be modelled and forecast. The PyRoss library enables fitting to epidemiological data, as available, using Bayesian parameter inference, so that competing models can be weighed by their evidence. PyRoss allows fully Bayesian forecasts of the impact of idealized NPIs by convolving uncertainties arising from epidemiological data, model choice, parameters, and intrinsic stochasticity. Algorithms to optimize time-dependent NPI scenarios against user-defined cost functions are included. PyRoss's current age-structured compartment framework for well-mixed populations will in future reports be extended to include compartments structured by location, occupation, use of travel networks and other attributes relevant to assessing disease spread and the impact of NPIs. We argue that such compartment models, by allowing social data of arbitrary granularity to be combined with Bayesian parameter estimation for poorly-known disease variables, could enable more powerful and robust prediction than other approaches to detailed epidemic modelling. We invite others to use the PyRoss library for research to address today's COVID-19 crisis, and to plan for future pandemics.","Adhikari, R.; Bolitho, Austen; Caballero, Fernando; Cates, Michael E.; Dolezal, Jakub; Ekeh, Timothy; Guioth, Jules; Jack, Robert L.; Kappler, Julian; Kikuchi, Lukas; Kobayashi, Hideki; Li, Yuting I.; Peterson, Joseph D.; Pietzonka, Patrick; Remez, Benjamin; Rohrbach, Paul B.; Singh, Rajesh; Turk, Gunther",,461,33

Its collateral fallout on head injury care has not been studied in detail, especially from low- and middle-income countries, possibly overwhelmed more than developed nations. Here, we analyze the effects of COVID19 restrictions on head injury patients in a high-volume Indian referral trauma center. METHODS: From the prospective trauma registry, clinico-epidemiological and radiological parameters of patients managed during 190 days before and 190 days during COVID19 phases were studied. As an indicator of care, the inpatient mortality of patients with severe HI was also compared with appropriate statistical analyses. RESULTS: Of the total 3372 patients, there were 83 head injury admissions per week before COVID19 restrictions, which decreased to 33 every week (60% drop) during the lock phases and stabilized at 46 per week during the unlock phases. COVID19 restrictions caused a significant increase in the proportion of patients arriving directly without resuscitation at peripheral centers and later than 6 h of injury. Though the most common mechanism was vehicular, a relative increase in the proportion of assaults was noted during COVID19. There was no change in the distribution of mild, moderate, and severe injuries. Despite a decrease in the percentage of patients with systemic illnesses, severe head injury mortality was significantly more during the lock phases than before COVID19 (59% vs. 47%, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: COVID19 restrictions have amplified the already delayed admission among patients of head injury from north-west India. The severe head injury mortality was significantly greater during lock phases than before COVID19, highlighting the collateral fallout of lockdown.

In the majority of cases patients are either asymptomatic or show mild to moderate symptoms and signs of a common cold. A subset of patients, however, develop a severe atypical pneumonia, with the characteristic ground-glass appearance on chest x-ray and computerized tomography, which evolves into an acute respiratory distress syndrome, that requires mechanical ventilation and eventually results in multiple organ failure and death. The Molecular pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still unknown. AIM OF THE STUDY: In the present work we performed a stringent metanalysis from the publicly available RNAseq data from bronchoalveolar cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells to elucidate molecular alterations and cellular deconvolution to identify immune cell profiles. RESULTS: Alterations in genes involved in hyaluronan, glycosaminoglycan and mucopolysaccharides metabolism were over-represented in bronchoalveolar cells infected by SARS-CoV-2, as well as potential lung infiltration with neutrophils, T CD4+ cell and macrophages. The blood mononuclear cells presented a proliferative state. Dramatic reduction of NK and T lymphocytes, whereas an exacerbated increase in monocytes. CONCLUSIONS: In summary our results revealed molecular pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection to bronchoalveolar cells inducing the hyaluronan and glycosaminoglycan metabolism that could shape partially the components of the ground-glass opacities observed in CT.

As the novel coronavirus continues to take its toll in the US and all across the globe, particularly among the elderly (&gt;65 years), clinicians and translational researchers are taking a closer look at the nexus of sleep, circadian rhythms and immunity that may contribute toward severe COVID-19 disease. SARS-CoV-2-induced multi-organ failure affects both central and peripheral organs, causing increased mortality in the elderly. However, whether differences in sleep, circadian rhythms, and immunity between older and younger individuals contribute to the age-related differences in systemic dysregulation of target organs observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection is still being investigated. Current literature demonstrates the emerging role of sleep, circadian rhythms, and immunity in the development of chronic pulmonary diseases and respiratory infections in human and mouse models. The exact mechanism underlying acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other cardiopulmonary complications in elderly patients in combination with associated comorbidities remain unclear. Nevertheless, understanding the nexus of sleep, circadian clock dysfunction in target organs, and immune status of patients with SARS-CoV-2 may provide novel insights into possible therapies. Chronotherapy is an emerging concept that is gaining attention in sleep medicine. Accumulating evidence suggests that nearly half of all physiological functions follow a strict daily rhythm. However, healthcare professionals rarely take implementing timed administration of drugs into consideration. In this review, we summarize recent findings directly relating to the contributing roles of sleep, circadian rhythms and immune response in modulating infectious disease processes, and integrate chronotherapy in the discussion of the potential drugs that can be repurposed to improve the treatment and management of the coronavirus disease -19 (COVID-19).","Giri, Allan Srinivasan Ashokkumar Sundar Isaac Kirubakaran",Frontiers in Neuroscience,461,24

At the start of the outbreak, cases were mostly individuals of Romanian origin; the outbreak subsequently spread to the wider population. Over the 8-month response, the IMT conducted the following control measures: extensive contact tracing, immediate provision of post-exposure prophylaxis, community engagement amongst specific high-risk groups, MMR awareness raising including catch-up campaigns and enhanced vaccination services at selected GP surgeries. Key challenges to the effective control measures included language difficulties limiting community engagement; delays in diagnosis, notification and appropriate isolation of cases; limited resources for contact tracing across multiple high-risk settings (including GPs and hospitals) and lack of timely data on vaccine coverage in sub-groups of the population to guide public health action.","Mulchandani, R; Sibal, B; Phillips, A; Suleman, S; Banerjee, A; Teagle, R; Foulkes, S; Spence, K; Edeghere, O",Epidemiol Infect,461,16

This study aimed to investigate the source of the outbreak and assess the risk of transmission of COVID-19 during the flight. METHOD: Using a standardized questionnaire, we collected information on the travelers' demographic characteristics and illness before, during, and after the flight. We also collected data on factors potentially associated with COVID-19 transmission during the flight. RESULTS: A total of 16 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed among all passengers; the overall attack rate was 4.8%. The attack rate among passengers who had departed from Wuhan was significantly higher than that among those who had departed from other places. One passenger without an epidemiological history of exposure before boarding developed COVID-19. During the flight, he was seated near four infected passengers from Wuhan for approximately an hour and did not wear his facemask correctly during the flight. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 transmission may have occurred during the flight. However, the majority of the cases in the flight-associated outbreak could not be attributed to transmission on the flight but were associated with exposure to the virus in Wuhan or to infected members in a single tour group.","Chen, Junfang; He, Hanqing; Cheng, Wei; Liu, Yan; Sun, Zhou; Chai, Chengliang; Kong, Qingxin; Sun, Wanwan; Zhang, Jiaqi; Guo, Song; Shi, Xuguang; Wang, Jinna; Chen, Enfu; Chen, Zhiping",Travel Med Infect Dis,461,1

Objective: we aimed to assess STD in healthcare professionals (HCP), mainly allergists, affected with COVID-19, by means of a survey, and to evaluate the association of STD and their severity with demographic characteristics, symptoms, comorbidities, and hospital admission. METHODS: A 15-item questionnaire was designed including different sections as follows: demographics, diagnostic characteristics, STD patterns, medication use as well as comorbidities. The questionnaire was developed using Google forms, implemented and distributed to members of the Spanish Society of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (SEAIC) and spread via Social Media to be completed by HCP affected with COVID-19. RESULTS: HCP (n=234), 76.5% &#8804;55 yrs, 73.5% female, completed the survey. There was STD in up to 74.4% of the respondents, 95.6% reporting a moderate-severe impairment. Mean recovery time of taste dysfunction was 21.6±24.0 days in HCP &#8804;55 yrs and 33.61±26.2 days in >55 yrs (p=0.019). Stratified analysis by severity of STD showed that more than a half of COVID-19 subjects presented severe loss of smell. An older age (>55 yrs) was associated with fever, anorexia, less headache and with a longer persistence of taste dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: STD is a common symptom in COVID-19, even as a unique or preceding symptom. HCP who declared smell dysfunction (SD) were younger than those not affected with STD. Taste dysfunction (TD) may imply more systemic involvement in COVID-19-positive HCP.","Antolín-Amérigo, D; Cubero, J L; Colás, C; Alobid, I; Mullol, J; Valero, A",J Investig Allergol Clin Immunol,461,16

Our aim was to describe the topography of extrinsic tongue muscles and show that their involvement in oropharyngeal cancers does not always correspond to T4a staging. METHODS: This cadaveric study was based on dissections of the tongues of ten healthy subjects. Dissections were carried out using sections, and careful macroscopic examination with a 3.5-diopter magnifying glass allowed the identification of muscles from their origin to their termination. Imagery and histology were excluded to stay as close as possible to the clinical evaluation. RESULTS: The sample comprised seven men and three women, with a mean age 82 years. In all the ten cases, the extrinsic muscles were located at the periphery of the tongue. The genioglossus was the only deep extrinsic muscle, extending to the periphery and under the mucous membrane of the tongue. As a result, a T1 tumor can invade the mucous membrane and affect the extrinsic muscles without transforming into a T4a tumor. CONCLUSION: As extrinsic tongue muscles are peripheral and submucosal, the use of the term ""deep"" is erroneous, as is the systematic usage of extrinsic muscles to define T4a oropharyngeal cancers. This study attempts to explain this error, which is recurrent in the different editions of the Union for International Cancer Control and American Joint Committee on Cancer.","Touré, Gaoussou; Vlavonou, Sandrine; Andrianantoandro, Iavosoa; Ndiaye, Makhtar Mouhamadou",J. oral maxillofac. surg,461,1

Because of the role of social and environmental factors in COVID-19 transmission and burden of disease, it is essential to ensure that there is adequate coordination of population-based health services and public health interventions. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the primary and community healthcare (P&CHC) system's weaknesses worldwide. In many instances, P&CHC played only a minor role, the emphasis being on hospital and intensive care beds. This was compounded by political failures, in supporting local community resilience. Placing community building, social cohesion and resilience at the forefront of dealing with the COVID-19 crisis can help align solutions that provide a vision of 'planetary health'. This can be achieved by involving local well-being and participation in the face of any pervasive health and environmental crisis, including other epidemics and large-scale ecological crises. This paper proposes that P&CHC should take on two critical roles: first, to support local problem-solving efforts and to serve as a partner in innovative approaches to safeguarding community well-being; and second, to understand the local environment and health risks in the context of the global health perspective. We see this as an opportunity of immediate value and broad consequence beyond the control of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lauriola, Paolo; Martín-Olmedo, Piedad; Leonardi, Giovanni S; Bouland, Catherine; Verheij, Robert; Dückers, Michel L A; van Tongeren, Martie; Laghi, Ferdinando; van den Hazel, Peter; Gokdemir, Ozden; Segredo, Evelyn; Etzel, Ruth A; Abelsohn, Alan; Bianchi, Fabrizio; Romizi, Roberto; Miserotti, Giuseppe; Romizi, Francesco; Bortolotti, Paolo; Vinci, Emanuele; Giustetto, Guido; Santamaria, Mariagrazia; Serafini, Alice; Pegoraro, Samantha; Agius, Raymond; Zeka, Ariana",,461,1

Patients with COVID-19 most commonly present with respiratory symptoms. However, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms can also occur. We aimed to study the relationship between GI symptoms and disease prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Methods: In a single-center and retrospective cohort study, the outcomes in COVID-19 patients with or without GI symptoms were compared. The propensity score is a conditional probability of having a particular exposure (COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms vs. without GI symptoms) given a set of baseline measured covariates. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and any differences in survival were evaluated with a stratified log-rank-test. To explore the GI symptoms associated with ARDS, non-invasive ventilator treatment, tracheal intubation, tracheotomy, and CRRT, univariable and multivariable COX regression models were used. Results: Among 1,113 eligible patients, 359 patients with GI symptoms and 718 without GI symptoms had similar propensity scores and were included in the analyses. Patients with GI symptoms, as compared with those without GI symptoms, were associated with a similar risk of death, but with higher risks of ARDS, non-invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients, respectively. Conclusions: The presence of GI symptoms was associated with a high risk of ARDS, non-invasive mechanical ventilation and tracheal intubation in patients with COVID-19 but not mortality.","Chen, Rong; Yu, Yan-Li; Li, Wei; Liu, Ya; Lu, Jing-Xiao; Chen, Fangyue; Zhou, Qin; Xia, Zhong-Yuan; Gao, Ling; Meng, Qing-Tao; Ma, Daqing",Front Med (Lausanne),461,20

By comparing the predictive accuracy between multiple regression and machine learning models before and after the use of random forest recursive feature elimination, all multiple regression, and machine learning models showed improved accuracy while the most accurate model was the elastic net regression with 65.2% explained variance. The results show only neutral (4.11 on a 7-point Likert scale) regarding the overall satisfaction score on ERL. Even majority of students are competent in technology and have no obvious issue in accessing learning devices or Wi-Fi, face-to-face learning is more preferable compared to ERL and this is found to be the most important predictor. Besides, the level of efforts made by instructors, the agreement on the appropriateness of the adjusted assessment methods, and the perception of online learning being well delivered are shown to be highly important in determining the satisfaction scores.

The impact of COVID-19 on the thyroid gland has been described but several aspects have to be clarified. The systematic review was conceived to achieve more solid information about: 1) which thyroid disease or dysfunction should be expected in COVID-19 patients; 2) whether thyroid patients have a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection; 3) whether the management has to be adapted in thyroid patient when infected. The literature was searched by two authors independently. A 5-step search strategy was a priori adopted. Only reviews focused on the relationship between thyroid and COVID-19 were included. The last search was performed on February 21st 2021. Two-hundred-forty-seven records was initially found and nine reviews were finally included. The reviews identified several potential thyroid consequences in COVID-19 patients, such as thyrotoxicosis, low-T3 syndrome and subacute thyroiditis, while no relevant data were found regarding the potential impact of COVID-19 on the management of patients on thyroid treatment. The present systematic review of reviews found that: 1) patients diagnosed with COVID-19 can develop thyroid dysfunction, frequently non-thyroidal illness syndrome when hospitalized in intensive care unit, 2) having a thyroid disease does not increase the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 3) thyroid patients do not need a COVID-19-adapted follow-up. Anyway, several factors, such as critical illness and medications, could affect thyroid laboratory tests.","Trimboli, Pierpaolo; Camponovo, Chiara; Scappaticcio, Lorenzo; Bellastella, Giuseppe; Piccardo, Arnoldo; Rotondi, Mario",Rev Endocr Metab Disord,461,16

The fact that only a small subset of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop severe disease suggests that there have to be some predisposing factors, but biomarkers that reliably predict disease severity have not been found so far. Since overactivation of the immune system is implicated in a severe form of COVID-19 and the IgG glycosylation is known to be involved in the regulation of different immune processes, we evaluated the association of inter-individual variation in IgG N-glycome composition with the severity of COVID-19. The analysis of 166 severe and 167 mild cases from hospitals in Spain, Italy and Portugal revealed statistically significant differences in the composition of the IgG N-glycome. The most notable difference was the decrease in bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in severe patients from all three cohorts. IgG galactosylation was also lower in severe cases in all cohorts, but the difference in galactosylation was not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing.","Petrovic, Tea; Alves, Inês; Bugada, Dario; Pascual, Julio; Vuckovic, Frano; Skelin, Andrea; Gaifem, Joana; Villar-Garcia, Judit; Vicente, Manuel M; Fernandes, Ângela; Dias, Ana M; Kurolt, Ivan-Christian; Markotic, Alemka; Primorac, Dragan; Soares, Adriana; Malheiro, Luis; Trbojevic-Akmacic, Irena; Abreu, Miguel; Sarmento E Castro, Rui; Bettinelli, Silvia; Callegaro, Annapaola; Arosio, Marco; Sangiorgio, Lorena; Lorini, Luca F; Castells, Xavier; Horcajada, Juan P; Pinho, Salomé S; Allegri, Massimo; Barrios, Clara; Lauc, Gordan",Glycobiology,461,16

Using a purchasing experiment, study 1 examined the positive effect of unneeded consumption behaviour on recovery among 100 MBA students. Using the experience sampling method, the data in study 2 were collected from 115 consumers (employees) using ten iterations of 2-day continual questionnaires (Sunday and the following Monday) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results from multilevel structural equation modelling indicate that unneeded consumption behaviour positively impacts work engagement in a moderated mediating mode. Consumer indulgence positively moderates the mediating effect of recovery level on the relationship between indulgent consumption behaviour and work engagement, while perceived consumer effectiveness negatively moderates the mediating effect of recovery level. This paper also identifies the value of transformation from consumption to work during the COVID-19 pandemic.","He, Jianjia; Liu, Shengmin; Li, Tingting; Mai, Thi Hoai Thuong",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),461,3

Social isolation and the use of personal protective equipment - the latter being especially important for health care workers - emerged as two of the main methods of preventing the spread of the disease. The eye can represent a source of transmission through contaminated tears, as well as a source of infection for respiratory droplets or aerosol particles, which may come into contact with the ocular surface and migrate to the lungs and other parts of the body. Objectives: To investigate the risk of ocular transmission through a literature review and identify ways of preventing it. Methods: A search of the scientific literature was conducted in the PubMed and Cochrane databases, using a combination of the following keywords: “COVID-19,” “eye,” “personal protective equipment,” “SARS-CoV-2,” “protective goggles,” “face shields,” and “workers' health.” Results: The mechanisms of ocular transmission have not been fully elucidated, but studies have demonstrated the presence of viral RNA in the conjunctival sac and aerosolized secretions of contaminated patients;these droplets may come into contact with the eyes of uninfected bystanders, entering the respiratory system through the nose and gaining access to the lungs. Conclusions: Studies show that the virus can be effectively transmitted through the eyes, underscoring the importance of protective goggles for health care workers or potential transmitters of the virus, in addition to the need for additional education measures to encourage hand hygiene and discourage touching of the eyes. © 2021 Associacao Nacional de Medicina do Trabalho.

Despite landmark medical advancements, mortality due to cardiovascular disease is still 20 times higher in CKD patients than in the general population, which is mainly due to the high prevalence of risk factors in this group. Indeed, in addition to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, CKD patients are exposed to nontraditional ones, which include metabolic, hormonal, and inflammatory alterations. The global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has brought novel challenges for both cardiologists and nephrologists alike. Emerging evidence indicates that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increases the risk of cardiovascular events and that several aspects of the disease may synergize with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors in CKD patients. A better understanding of these mechanisms is pivotal for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular events in this context, and we believe that additional clinical and experimental studies are needed to improve cardiovascular outcomes in CKD patients with COVID-19. In this review, we provide a summary of traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors in CKD patients, discussing their interaction with SARS-CoV-2 infection and focusing on CO-VID-19-related cardiovascular complications that may severely affect short- and long-term outcomes in this high-risk population.","Podestà, Manuel Alfredo; Valli, Federica; Galassi, Andrea; Cassia, Matthias A; Ciceri, Paola; Barbieri, Lucia; Carugo, Stefano; Cozzolino, Mario",Blood Purif,461,16

The aim of this study was to determine the association between acute deterioration risk, care complexity factors and unfavourable outcomes in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A multicentre cohort study was conducted from 1 to 31 March 2020 at seven hospitals in Catalonia. All adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospitals and with a complete minimum data set were recruited retrospectively. Patients were classified based on the presence or absence of a composite unfavourable outcome (in-hospital mortality and adverse events). The main measures included risk of acute deterioration (as measured using the VIDA early warning system) and care complexity factors. All data were obtained blinded from electronic health records. Multivariate logistic analysis was performed to identify the VIDA score and complexity factors associated with unfavourable outcomes. RESULTS: Out of a total of 1176 patients with COVID-19, 506 (43%) experienced an unfavourable outcome during hospitalisation. The frequency of unfavourable outcomes rose with increasing risk of acute deterioration as measured by the VIDA score. Risk factors independently associated with unfavourable outcomes were chronic underlying disease (OR: 1.90, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.72; p<0.001), mental status impairment (OR: 2.31, 95% CI 1.45 to 23.66; p<0.001), length of hospital stay (OR: 1.16, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.21; p<0.001) and high risk of acute deterioration (OR: 4.32, 95% CI 2.83 to 6.60; p<0.001).

Despite the disproportionate incidence of Covid-19 among underserved and racial and ethnic minority populations, the safety and efficacy of the anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab in patients from these populations who are hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia are unclear. METHODS: We randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia who were not receiving mechanical ventilation to receive standard care plus one or two doses of either tocilizumab (8 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously) or placebo. Site selection was focused on the inclusion of sites enrolling high-risk and minority populations. The primary outcome was mechanical ventilation or death by day 28. RESULTS: A total of 389 patients underwent randomization, and the modified intention-to-treat population included 249 patients in the tocilizumab group and 128 patients in the placebo group; 56.0% were Hispanic or Latino, 14.9% were Black, 12.7% were American Indian or Alaska Native, 12.7% were non-Hispanic White, and 3.7% were of other or unknown race or ethnic group. The cumulative percentage of patients who had received mechanical ventilation or who had died by day 28 was 12.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.5 to 16.9) in the tocilizumab group and 19.3% (95% CI, 13.3 to 27.4) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for mechanical ventilation or death, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.97; P = 0.04 by the log-rank test). Clinical failure as assessed in a time-to-event analysis favored tocilizumab over placebo (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.93). Death from any cause by day 28 occurred in 10.4% of the patients in the tocilizumab group and 8.6% of those in the placebo group (weighted difference, 2.0 percentage points; 95% CI, -ï»¿5.2 to 7.8). In the safety population, serious adverse events occurred in 38 of 250 patients (15.2%) in the tocilizumab group and 25 of 127 patients (19.7%) in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized patients with Covid-19 pneumonia who were not receiving mechanical ventilation, tocilizumab reduced the likelihood of progression to the composite outcome of mechanical ventilation or death, but it did not improve survival.

This study aimed to assess the accuracy of the SARS-CoV-2 RAD for testing of nasopharyngeal swab specimens and saliva samples in comparison with the RT-PCR tests and viral culture for detecting viable virus. METHODS: One hundred seventeen nasopharyngeal swab specimens and 73 saliva samples with positive results on RT-PCR were used. Residual samples were assayed using a commercially available RAD test immediately, and its positivity was determined at various time points during the clinical course. The concordance between 54 nasopharyngeal swab samples and saliva samples that were collected simultaneously was determined. Viral culture was performed on 117 samples and compared with the results of the RAD test. RESULTS: The positive rate of RAD test using saliva samples was low throughout the clinical course. Poor concordance was observed between nasopharyngeal swab specimens and saliva samples (75.9%, kappa coefficient 0.310). However, a substantially high concordance between the RAD test and viral culture was observed in both nasopharyngeal swab specimens (86.8%, kappa coefficient 0.680) and saliva samples (95.1%, kappa coefficient 0.643). CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 RAD test was insufficient, particularly for saliva samples. However, a substantially high concordance with viral culture suggests its potential utility as an auxiliary test for estimating SARS-CoV-2 viability.","Uwamino, Yoshifumi; Nagata, Mika; Aoki, Wataru; Nakagawa, Terumichi; Inose, Rika; Yokota, Hiromitsu; Furusawa, Yuri; Sakai-Tagawa, Yuko; Iwatsuki-Horimoto, Kiyoko; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Hasegawa, Naoki; Murata, Mitsuru",J Infect Chemother,461,26

This review scopes and analyzes published orthodontic literature in eight different domains: (1) robotic dental assistants; (2) robotics in diagnosis and simulation of orthodontic problems; (3) robotics in orthodontic patient education, teaching, and training; (4) wire bending and customized appliance robotics; (5) nanorobots/microrobots for acceleration of tooth movement and for remote monitoring; (6) robotics in maxillofacial surgeries and implant placement; (7) automated aligner production robotics; and (8) TMD rehabilitative robotics. A total of 1,150 records were searched, of which 124 potentially relevant articles were retrieved in full. 87 studies met the selection criteria following screening and were included in the scoping review. The review found that studies pertaining to arch wire bending and customized appliance robots, simulative robots for diagnosis, and surgical robots have been important areas of research in the last decade (32%, 22%, and 16%). Rehabilitative robots and nanorobots are quite promising and have been considerably reported in the orthodontic literature (13%, 9%). On the other hand, assistive robots, automated aligner production robots, and patient robots need more scientific data to be gathered in the future (1%, 1%, and 6%). Technological readiness of different robotic applications in orthodontics was further assessed. The presented eight domains of robotic technologies were assigned to an estimated technological readiness level according to the information given in the publications. Wire bending robots, TMD robots, nanorobots, and aligner production robots have reached the highest levels of technological readiness: 9; diagnostic robots and patient robots reached level 7, whereas surgical robots and assistive robots reached lower levels of readiness: 4 and 3, respectively.","Adel, Samar; Zaher, Abbas; El Harouni, Nadia; Venugopal, Adith; Premjani, Pratik; Vaid, Nikhilesh",Biomed Res Int,461,10

We retrospectively reviewed clinical characteristics and risk factors for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases among PUIs at a tertiary care center in Bangkok, Thailand, between March 23 and April 7, 2020. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was performed. There were 405 evaluable PUIs; 157 (38.8%) were men, with a mean age ± SD of 36.2 ± 12.6 years. The majority (68.9%) reported no comorbidities. There were 53 (13.1%) confirmed COVID-19 cases. The most common symptoms among those were cough (73.6%), fever (58.5%), sore throat (39.6%), and muscle pain (37.4%). Among these patients, diagnoses were upper respiratory tract infection (69.8%), viral syndrome (15.1%), pneumonia (11.3%), and asymptomatic infection (3.8%).

To ground this suggestion and emphasize the complexity and significance of migrant health research, we start by briefly reviewing several migration-related notions including the process of migration and its key facilitators and benefits;existing barriers to the provision of migrant health care;and the intricate links between health systems, health professionals, and migrant health. The three areas of research examined in this article address (i) the specific role of health workers in providing care to migrants and refugees and their capacity to do so, (ii) the health problems experienced by health workers who become migrants or refugees, and (iii) the precarious employment conditions experienced by both migrant and non-migrant health care workers. After summarizing the current available evidence on these topics, we discuss key information gaps and strategies to address them, while also incorporating several relevant COVID-19 pandemic considerations and research implications. Expanding the focus of research studies on migration and health could not only enhance the results of current strategies by supplying additional information to support their implementation but also spearhead the development of new solutions to the migrant health problem.","Gunn, Dr Virginia Somani Rozina Bloomberg Lawrence S.; Muntaner, Dr Carles",Journal of Migration and Health,461,1

Still, authentication of mobile device-to-server (in both homogeneous and heterogeneous IoMT) is not explicitly addressed for the black-hole attack. In this paper, a device-to-server and vice versa mutual authentication scheme are presented to ensure secure communication sessions among numerous mobile devices Ci and server Sj in the operational IoMT. The proposed scheme is a hybrid of Medium Access Control (MAC) and enhanced on-demand vector (EAODV)-enabled routing schemes. In the proposed scheme, an offline phase is introduced to complete the registration process of member devices with the concerned server module. It blocks every possible entry of the potential intruder devices Ak in the operational IoMT. A mobile device, Ci, interested in initiating a communication session with a particular Server Sj, is needed to pass the mutual authentication process. As a result, only registered devices Ci are allowed to communicate. Additionally, a reliable encryption and decryption scheme is used to ensure data reliability during these communication sessions. Simulation results verify the exceptional performance of the proposed mutual authentication scheme in terms of authenticity, security, and integrity of both devices and data in the operational IoMT.

The onset of severe COVID-19 could lead to multiple organ damage and even death. It is worth paying attention to the warning index of the onset for severe COVID-19 so that patients can be identified and monitored carefully. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The report is a retrospective study that describes and analyzes the clinical features during the treatment of COVID-19. Four patients with COVID-19 were involved in this study, who were father-and-son pairs from two families. All patients were treated with the same combination of anti-microbial and anti-viral agents for 10-14 days, adjusting for the disease status. The primary outcome measure was SARS-CoV-2 detection using RT-qPCR with oropharyngeal swabs. Chest CT imaging served as a secondary outcome measure. RESULTS: One of the four patients progressed to severe disease, while the remaining patients recovered with the same treatment. A persistent decrease in the lymphocyte ratio and increase in the C-reactive protein (CRP) level were observed in the severe patient, along with other typical symptoms of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The cases we described indicate that blood cell and CRP tests could be useful risk warnings of severe onset of COVID-19.","Song, Y-S; Hao, Y-B; Liu, H-T; Li, L-H; Yang, Z-Z; Liu, W-W; Liu, Q; Zhang, S-S; Fan, T-L",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,461,16

In light of CPT symmetry, the Universe's initial condition is thought to be somehow responsible. We propose a model, the stochastic partitioned cellular automaton (SPCA), in which to study the mechanisms and consequences of emergent irreversibility. While their most natural definition is probabilistic, we show that SPCA dynamics can be made deterministic and reversible, by attaching randomly initialized degrees of freedom. This property motivates analogies to classical field theories. We develop the foundations of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics on SPCAs. Of particular interest are the second law of thermodynamics, and a mutual information law which proves fundamental in non-equilibrium settings. We believe that studying the dynamics of information on SPCAs will yield insights on foundational topics in computer engineering, the sciences, and the philosophy of mind. As evidence of this, we discuss several such applications, including an extension of Landauer's principle, and sketch a physical justification of the causal decision theory that underlies the so-called psychological arrow of time.","Ebtekar, Aram",,461,1

There is much debate about the major route of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmissions. So, more evidence is required to determine the potential pathway of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 including airborne transmission. Therefore, we examined the potential aerosol transmission of the virus through hospital wards indoor air by confirmed COVID-19 patients on May 7, 2020. In order to capture airborne SARS-CoV-2, the liquid impinger biosampler was used to take fourteen air samples in different wards of the indoor air of the hospital. The specific primer and probe real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were applied to detect viral genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in positive air samples. Accordingly, we found two positive air samples (in the ICU) out of 14 ones taken from different wards with confirmed COVID-19 patients. The results revealed the possibility of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 though more studies are required to determine the role of actual mechanisms such as cough, sneeze, normal breathing and speaking in the emission of airborne size carrier aerosols. Likewise, more quantitative analyses are needed to estimate airborne viability of SARS-CoV-2 in the carrier aerosols.","Kenarkoohi, Azra; Noorimotlagh, Zahra; Falahi, Shahab; Amarloei, Ali; Mirzaee, Seyyed Abbas; Pakzad, Iraj; Bastani, Elham",Sci Total Environ,461,16

Despite increasing international calls for the inclusion of evidence-based decision-making (EBDM) processes in chronic disease prevention and control programming as well as policymaking, there is relatively little research that assesses the current capacity of physicians and the factors that influence that capacity in China. METHOD: This cross-sectional study was conducted in community health centres (CHCs) in Shanghai, China, using multistage cluster sampling. An evidence-based chronic disease prevention (EBCDP) evaluation tool was employed to assess physician EBCDP awareness, adoption, implementation and maintenance based on the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and using a 7-point Likert scale. Linear regression analysis was used to assess associations between each EBCDP aspect and overall EBCDP status with participant characteristics or organizational factors. RESULT: A total of 892 physicians from CHCs in Shanghai, China, were assessed. The physicians perceived their awareness (mean = 4.90, SD = 1.02) and maintenance (mean = 4.71, SD = 1.07) of EBCDP to be relatively low. Physicians with relatively lower job titles and monthly incomes (> 9000 RMB) tended to have relatively higher scores for the awareness, adoption, and implementation of EBCDP (P < 0.05). Those who had participated in one program for chronic disease prevention and control were less likely to adopt (b = - 0.284, P = 0.007), implement (b = - 0.292, P = 0.004), and maintain (b = - 0.225, P = 0.025) EBCDP than those who had participated in more programs. Physicians in general practice (Western medicine) had a lower level of awareness of EBCDP than those in other departments (P < 0.0001). Physician from CHCs located in suburban areas had lower scores for awareness (b = - 0.150, P = 0.047), implementation (b = - 0.171, P = 0.029), and maintenance (b = - 0.237, P = 0.002) that those from urban CHCs. Physicians in CHCs affiliated with universities had higher scores on all four EBCDP aspects that those in CHCs not affiliated with a university. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides quantitative evidence illustrating EBCDP practices among physicians in CHCs with various personal and organizational characteristics, respectively. More methods should be provided to increase the awareness of such physicians regarding EBCDP to stimulate the use of EBCDP for their patients and in connection with other public health priorities.","Fan, Feng; Wang, Zhaoxin; Yu, Dehua; Chen, Chen; Shen, Delei; Yu, Zhaohu; Liu, Xin; Zhou, Huining; Shi, Jianwei",BMC Fam Pract,461,1

Across all waves, intention to share details of close contacts was 79.1% (95% confidence interval 78.8% to 79.5%, n=36 145/45 680), increasing to 81.9% (80.1% to 83.6%, n=1547/1890) from 25 to 27 January. Non-adherence was associated with being male, younger age, having a dependent child in the household, lower socioeconomic grade, greater financial hardship during the pandemic, and working in a key sector. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of adherence to test, trace, and isolate are low, although some improvement has occurred over time. Practical support and financial reimbursement are likely to improve adherence. Targeting messaging and policies to men, younger age groups, and key workers might also be necessary.","Smith, Louise E; Potts, Henry W W; Amlôt, Richard; Fear, Nicola T; Michie, Susan; Rubin, G James",BMJ,461,18

If the filtration might be combined with antiviral agents simultaneously in the masks, this would be much more efficient during the use of these masks and against cross-infection after being discarded. For centuries, sodium chloride (NaCl) contributes to inhibiting pathogens on various occasions. If aerosol with infectious agents reaches the filtering face-piecé surface of the filtering face-piece, coated with hypertonic saline, they become attracted by hygroscopic salt crystals. Proteins and nucleic acids lose their structural integrity and become inactivated concerning their infectious properties. We provide further evidence for cell growth inhibition with hypertonic saline in yeast cells comprising a defending cell wall. Proliferation was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner, i.e., above 50 g/L, yeast cell proliferation was completely blocked. At a NaCl concentration of 100 g/L, even decomposition of the original inoculated organisms was observed. Therefore, we conclude that hypertonic saline- coated filtering facepiece might strongly reduce the numbers of infectious particles on their surfaces and thus protect mask carriers efficiently from infections.","Tatzber, Franz; Resch, Ulrike; Lindschinger, Meinrad; Cvirn, Gerhard; Wonisch, Willibald",Prev Med Rep,461,16

However, data on exposure and impact of misinformation is not readily available. OBJECTIVE: We aim to characterize and compare the start, peak and doubling time of COVID-19 misinformation topics across eight countries using an exponential growth model usually employed to study infectious disease epidemics. METHODS: COVID-19 misinformation topics were selected from the WHO Mythbusters website. Data representing exposure was obtained from Google Trends API for eight English-speaking countries. Exponential growth models were used in modeling trends for each country. RESULTS: Searches for ""coronavirus AND 5G"" started at different times but peaked in the same week for six countries. Searches for 5G also had the shortest doubling time across all misinformation topics, with the shortest time in Nigeria and South Africa (approximately 4 to 5 days). Searches for ""coronavirus AND ginger"" started at the same time (the week of January 19) for several countries, but peaks were incongruent and searches did not always grow exponentially after the initial week. Searches for ""coronavirus AND sun"" had different start times across countries, but peaked at the same time for multiple countries. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns in start, peak and doubling time for ""coronavirus AND 5G"" were different from the other misinformation topics and were mostly consistent across countries assessed, which might be attributable to a lack of public understanding of 5G technology. Understanding the spread of misinformation, similarities and differences across different contexts can help in the development of appropriate interventions for limiting its impact similar to how we address infectious disease epidemics. Furthermore, the rapid proliferation of misinformation that discourages adherence to public health interventions could be predictive of future increases in disease cases.","Nsoesie, Elaine Okanyene; Cesare, Nina; Müller, Martin; Ozonoff, Al",J. med. internet res,461,24

Studies have confirmed asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 have potential infectivity, and most of the transmission occurred before symptoms appear. Asymptomatic infection rates varied widely in different countries and regions. Identifying the asymptomatic infected persons and cutting off the infection source is an effective way to prevent the spread of this disease. However, asymptomatic patients have hidden clinical symptoms, and screening based only on the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 can easily lead to a missed diagnosis. Therefore, determining asymptomatic infection patients by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is the gold standard. A series of prevention and control measures adopted by the Chinese government, especially the ""Four Early"" policy, have achieved outstanding achievements, which are worth learning from by other countries.","Chen, Zheng; Wang, Bili; Mao, Shanshan; Ye, Qing",Int J Biol Sci,461,20

Public awareness and adherence to the recommendations play a major role in managing a crisis of this magnitude which is largely affected by knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP). Hence, the aim of this study was to assess COVID-19-related KAP of the University of Sharjah (UOS) students and compare between health-related (HR) and non-HR (NHR) majors. A cross-sectional study was conducted in May 2020 in which 1,012 (481 health-related and 531 NHR) students participated via an online KAP questionnaire. The students' sociodemographic characteristics and sources of information were also recorded, and data were analyzed. Students were aged 20-25 years, with an overall knowledge score of 72.4%, and the main source of their information was the Internet and social media (85.2%). Those in HR majors had a higher knowledge score (76%) than those in NHR students (69%). Regarding attitudes, both HR and NHR students demonstrated comparable and positive attitudes to curb the spread. With respect to practices, more NHR students used masks (92.3%), almost all the time than HR students (88.4%). HR students (99.4%) avoided crowded places and practiced social distancing more than NHR students (99.4% versus 97.4% and 97.7% versus 93.2%, respectively). In conclusion, UOS students demonstrated adequate knowledge, and possessed good attitudes and low-risk practices toward prevention of COVID-19.

METHODS: In the discovery cohort, the gene expression level of 84 lncRNAs were measured in the blood of 24 adult patients including healthy controls and patients with asthma and COPD. In the replication cohort the expression of 6 selected lncRNAs were measured in 163 subjects including healthy controls and adults with allergic rhinitis, asthma, COPD and children with asthma. It was evaluated whether these lncRNAs can be used as diagnostic biomarkers for any studied disease. With systems biology analysis the biological functions of the selected lncRNAs were predicted. RESULTS: In the discovery cohort, the mean expression of 27 lncRNAs showed nominally significant differences in at least one comparison. OIP5-AS1, HNRNPU, RP11-325K4.3, JPX, RP11-282O18.3, MZF1-AS1 were selected for measurement in the replication cohort. Three lncRNAs (HNRNPU, RP11-325K4.3, JPX) expressed significantly higher in healthy children than in adult controls. All the mean expression level of the 6 lncRNAs differed significantly between adult allergic rhinitis patients and controls. RP11-325K4.3, HNRNPU and OIP5-AS1 expressed higher in allergic asthma than in non-allergic asthma. COPD and asthma differed in the expression of RP11-325K4.3 from each other. In examining of the lncRNAs as biomarkers the weighted accuracy (WA) values were especially high in the comparison of healthy controls and patients with allergic rhinitis. OIP5-AS1 and JPX achieved 0.98 and 0.9 WA values, respectively, and the combination of the selected lncRNAs also resulted in a high performance (WA = 0.98). Altogether, OIP5-AS1 had the highest discriminative power in case of three out of six comparisons. CONCLUSION: Differences were detected in the expression of circulating lncRNAs in chronic respiratory diseases. Some of these differences might be utilized as biomarkers and also suggest a possible role of these lncRNAs in the pathomechanism of these diseases. The lncRNAs and the associated pathways are potential therapeutic targets in these diseases, but naturally additional studies are needed for the confirmation of these results.","Gál, Zsófia; Gézsi, András; Semsei, Ágnes F; Nagy, Adrienne; Sultész, Monika; Csoma, Zsuzsanna; Tamási, Lilla; Gálffy, Gabriella; Szalai, Csaba",J Transl Med,461,16

Proteins from our own innate immune system can serve as ideal sources of novel drug candidates thanks to their safety and immune regulation versatility. Some host defense RNases equipped with antiviral activity have been reported over time. Here, we try to summarize the currently available information on human RNases that can target viral pathogens, with special focus on enveloped single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses. Overall, host RNases can fight viruses by a combined multifaceted strategy, including the enzymatic target of the viral genome, recognition of virus unique patterns, immune modulation, control of stress granule formation, and induction of autophagy/apoptosis pathways. The review also includes a detailed description of representative enveloped ssRNA viruses and their strategies to interact with the host and evade immune recognition. For comparative purposes, we also provide an exhaustive revision of the currently approved or experimental antiviral drugs. Finally, we sum up the current perspectives of drug development to achieve successful eradication of viral infections.","Li, Jiarui; Boix, Ester",Virulence,461,2

Their effectiveness is however dependent on the uptake of such COVID-19 apps. OBJECTIVE: We examine the role of individuals' general health status in the willingness to participate in a COVID-19 tracing app, as well as the roles of socioeconomic characteristics and 'COVID-19 proximity.' METHODS: We draw on survey data from the WageIndicator Foundation: the Living and Working in Coronavirus Times. The survey collects data on labor market status, as well as potential confounders of the relationship between general health and COVID-19 app usage, such as sociodemographics and regular smartphone usage. The survey also contains information that allow us to examine the role of 'COVID-19 proximity,' such as having contracted the virus, having observed COVID-19 cases among family members or colleagues, displaying depressive symptoms, and anxiety. We select data collected in Spain, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands between ages 18 and 70 (N = 4,504). Logistic regressions are utilized to measure willingness to use a COVID-19 app. RESULTS: We find that the influence of socioeconomic factors on COVID-19 app usage varies dramatically between the four countries, although forms of not being employed (i.e.. recent job loss and inactivity) are consistently associated with lower willingness to use a tracing app (24.6%) as compared to employees (33.4%, P<.001). Among selected COVID-19 proximity indicators, having a close family member being infected with COVID-19 is associated with higher contact tracing app usage (36.3% vs. 27.1%, P<.001). Accounting for these proximity factors, and the country-variation therein, we find that having a poorer general health status is significantly associated with of a much higher likelihood of contact tracing app usage. That is, compared to a self-reported 'very good' health status (estimated probability of 29.6), a 'good' (+4.6%-points [1.2-8.1]) and 'fair or bad' (+6.3%-points [2.3-10.3]) health statuses yield markedly higher willingness to use a COVID-19 app. CONCLUSIONS: In so far public health policy is aimed at using smartphone contact tracing during off-peak periods in the pandemic, campaigns appealing to health benefits for oneself and that of family members may be most successful for increasing the COVID-19 tracing app uptake. Public health campaigns that rely on digital platforms would also benefit from taking seriously the country-specific distribution of privacy concerns.","Witteveen, Dirk; Pedraza, Pablo De",,461,13

Previous studies showing a correlation between certain laboratory tests and diagnosis suggest an alternative method based on an ensemble of tests. METHODS: We have trained a machine learning model to analyze the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 test results and 20 routine laboratory tests collected within a 2-day period around the SARS-CoV-2 test date. We used the model to compare SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients. RESULTS: In a cohort of 75,991 veteran inpatients and outpatients who tested for SARS-CoV-2 in the months of March through July, 2020, 7,335 of whom were positive by RT-PCR or antigen testing, and who had at least 15 of 20 lab results within the window period, our model predicted the results of the SARS-CoV-2 test with a specificity of 86.8%, a sensitivity of 82.4%, and an overall accuracy of 86.4% (with a 95% confidence interval of [86.0%, 86.9%]). CONCLUSIONS: While molecular-based and antibody tests remain the reference standard method for confirming a SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, their clinical sensitivity is not well known. The model described herein may provide a complementary method of determining SARS-CoV-2 infection status, based on a fully independent set of indicators, that can help confirm results from other tests as well as identify positive cases missed by molecular testing.","Bayat, Vafa; Phelps, Steven; Ryono, Russell; Lee, Chong; Parekh, Hemal; Mewton, Joel; Sedghi, Farshid; Etminani, Payam; Holodniy, Mark",Clin. infect. dis,461,26

The presence and zoonotic assemblages of G. duodenalis have previously been reported in rabbits. In this study, to understand the infection status of G. duodenalis in rabbits from Shaanxi province, a total of 537 fecal samples were collected from two breeds of rabbits in four age groups (<30 days, 31-90 days, 91-200 days and >200 days) from four geographical origins (Fengxiang, Yangling, Tongchuan, and Shanyang). The presence of G. duodenalis in these samples was assessed using molecular assays based on beta-giardin (bg). The glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) and triosephosphate isomerase (tpi) loci were then amplified in the bg-positive samples for multi-locus genotype (MLG) analysis. The total prevalence of G. duodenalis in these rabbits was 3.54% (19/537). Giardia duodenalis infection was found in both breeds of rabbits, and in all farms and age groups, but with no statistically significant differences related to these factors (p > 0.05). Two assemblages, including B and E, were identified, with the former the predominant assemblage detected in both breeds, and in all age groups and farms.

Nevertheless, the highly contagious virus has instigated an unimaginably rapid response from scientific and medical communities. OBJECTIVES: Pioneering research on molecular mechanisms underlying the viral transmission, molecular pathogenicity, and potential treatments will be highlighted in this review. The development of antiviral drugs specific to SARS-CoV-2 is a complicated and tedious process. To accelerate scientific discoveries and advancement, researchers are consolidating available data from associated coronaviruses into a single pipeline, which can be readily made available to vaccine developers. METHODS: In order to find studies evaluating the COVID-19 virus epidemiology, repurposed drugs and potential vaccines, web searches and bibliographical bases have been used with keywords that matches the content of this review. RESULTS: The published results of SARS-CoV-2 structures and interactomics have been used to identify potential therapeutic candidates. We illustrate recent publications on SARS-CoV-2, concerning its molecular, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics, and focus on innovative diagnostics technologies in the production pipeline. This objective of this review is to enhance the comprehension of the unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and strengthen future control measures. Lay Summary: An innovative analysis is evaluating the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim is to increase knowledge of possible viral detection methods, which highlights several new technology limitations and advantages. We have assessed some drugs currently for patients (Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Anakinra and Interferon beta 1a), as the feasibility of COVID-19 specific antivirals is not presently known. The study explores the race toward vaccine development and highlights some significant trials and candidates in various clinical phases. This research addresses critical knowledge gaps by identifying repurposed drugs currently under clinical trials.

The importance of public health surveillance systems to monitor the spread and impact of COVID-19 has been well demonstrated. The purpose of this study was to describe the development and effectiveness of a real-time public health syndromic surveillance system (ACES Pandemic Tracker) as an early warning system and to provide situational awareness in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We used hospital admissions data from the Acute Care Enhanced Surveillance (ACES) system to collect data on pre-defined groupings of symptoms (syndromes of interest; SOI) that may be related to COVID-19 from 131 hospitals across Ontario. To evaluate which SOI for suspected COVID-19 admissions were best correlated with laboratory confirmed admissions, laboratory confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions data were collected from the Ontario Ministry of Health. Correlations and time-series lag analysis between suspected and confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions were calculated. Data used for analyses covered the period between March 1, 2020 and September 21, 2020. RESULTS: Between March 1, 2020 and September 21, 2020, ACES Pandemic Tracker identified 22,075 suspected COVID-19 hospital admissions (150 per 100,000 population) in Ontario. After correlation analysis, we found laboratory-confirmed hospital admissions for COVID-19 were strongly and significantly correlated with suspected COVID-19 hospital admissions when SOI were included (Spearman's rho = 0.617) and suspected COVID-19 admissions when SOI were excluded (Spearman's rho = 0.867). Weak to moderate significant correlations were found among individual SOI. Laboratory confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions lagged in reporting by 3 days compared with suspected COVID-19 admissions when SOI were excluded. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the utility of a hospital admissions syndromic surveillance system to monitor and identify potential surges in severe COVID-19 infection within the community in a timely manner and provide situational awareness to inform preventive and preparatory health interventions.","Papadomanolakis-Pakis, Nicholas; Maier, Allison; van Dijk, Adam; VanStone, Nancy; Moore, Kieran Michael",BMC Public Health,461,1

A total of 464 smartphone users (346 women, 35 ± 12 years old, body mass index [BMI] 23.4 ± 4.5) participated in Period A (January 7 to April 28, 2019) and 622 smartphone users (533 women, 32 ± 11 years old, BMI 23.3 ± 4.0) participated in Period B (January 6 to April 26, 2020). Compared with Period A, there was a sharp decline in physical activity during Period B (4642 ± 3513 vs. 3814 ± 3529 steps/day, p<0.001), especially during the final 9 weeks in both periods (4907 ± 3908 vs. 3528 ± 3397 steps/day, p<0.001); however, there were large variations in physical activity among participants. We found a surprising trend during Period B toward increased happiness among women aged 30-50 years, the group most affected by stay-at-home policies that led to working from home and school closure. Moreover, daily eating duration declined in this population. Additionally, there was a positive association of happiness with steps per day in Period B (&#961; = 0.38, p = 0.02). Despite the many negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, subjective feelings of happiness among middle-aged Japanese women tended to increase, which indicates that some favorable lifestyle changes that could be adopted during quarantine in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Azuma, Koichiro; Nojiri, Tetsuya; Kawashima, Motoko; Hanai, Akiyoshi; Ayaki, Masahiko; Tsubota, Kazuo",PLoS One,461,15

Neonates with respiratory viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may pose a risk to healthcare workers. International guidelines differ on methods to minimize the risk due to limited data. OBJECTIVE: We examined the expiratory airflow dispersion during common neonatal resuscitation AGMPs using infant simulators. METHODS: Expiratory airflow dispersion in term and preterm manikins was simulated (n = 288) using fine particle smoke at tidal volumes of 5 ml/kg. Using ImageJ, we quantified dispersion during common airway procedures including endotracheal tube (ETT) and T-piece ventilation. RESULTS: Maximal expiratory dispersion distances for the unsupported airway and disconnected uncuffed ETT scenarios were 30.2 and 22.7 cm (term); 22.1 and 17.2 cm (preterm), respectively. Applying T-piece positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) via an ETT (ETTPEEP ) generated no expiratory dispersion but increased tube leak during term simulation, while ventilation breaths (ETTVENT ) caused significant expiratory dispersion and leak. There was no measurable dispersion during face mask ventilation. For term uncuffed ETT ventilation, the particle filter eliminated expiratory dispersion but increased leak. No expiratory dispersion and negligible leak were observed when combining a cuffed ETT and filter. Angulated T-pieces generated the greatest median dispersion distances of 35.8 cm (ETTPEEP ) and 23.3 cm (ETTVENT ). CONCLUSIONS: Airflow dispersion during neonatal AGMPs is greater than previously postulated and potentially could contaminate healthcare providers during resuscitation of infants infected with contagious viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. It is possible to mitigate this risk using particle filters and cuffed ETTs. Applicability in the clinical setting requires further evaluation.","Kwok, T039; Chang, ng; Swaby, Rabbi; Sharkey, Don",Pediatr Pulmonol,461,21

Publicly available, county-level time series data on mobility are derived from individual GPS-devices, providing a variety of indices of social distancing behavior per day. Such indices allow a fine-grained approach to modeling public behavior during the pandemic. Previous studies of social distancing and policy have not accounted for the occurrence of pre-policy social distancing and other dynamics reflected in the long-term trajectories of public mobility data. OBJECTIVE: We propose a differential equation state-space model of county-level social distancing that accounts for distancing behavior leading up to the first official policies, equilibrium dynamics reflected in the long-term trajectories of mobility, and the specific impacts of four kinds of policy. The model is fit to each US county individually, producing a nation-wide data set of novel, estimated mobility indices. METHODS: A differential equation model was fit to three indicators of mobility for each of N=3054 counties, with T=100 occasions per county of: distance traveled, visitations to key sites, and the log number of interpersonal encounters. The indicators were highly correlated and assumed to share common underlying latent trajectory, dynamics, and responses to policy. Maximum likelihood estimation with the Kalman-Bucy filter was used to estimate the model parameters. Bivariate distributional plots and descriptive statistics were used to examine the resulting county-level parameter estimates. The association of chronology with policy impact was also considered. RESULTS: Mobility dynamics show moderate correlations with two census covariates: population density (Spearman's r ranging from .11 to .31) and median household income (Spearman's r ranging from -.03 to .39). Stay-at-home order effects were negatively correlated with both (r=-.37 and r=-.38 respectively) while the effects of the ban on all gatherings were positively correlated with both (r=.51, r=.39). Chronological ordering of policies was a moderate to strong determinant of their effect per county (Spearman's r ranging from -.12 to -.56), with earlier policies accounting for most of the change in mobility, and later policies having little or no additional effect. CONCLUSIONS: Chronological ordering, population density, and median household income were all associated with policy impact. The stay-at-home order and the ban on gatherings had the largest impacts on mobility on average. The model is implemented in a graphical online app for exploring county-level statistics and running counterfactual simulations. Future studies can incorporate the model-derived indices of social distancing and policy impacts as important social determinants of COVID-19 health outcomes.","McKee, Kevin L; Crandell, Ian C; Hanlon, Alexandra L",,461,16

Here, we systematically analyze the impact of SARS-CoV-2 proteins on interferon (IFN) responses and autophagy. We show that SARS-CoV-2 proteins synergize to counteract anti-viral immune responses. For example, Nsp14 targets the type I IFN receptor for lysosomal degradation, ORF3a prevents fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes, and ORF7a interferes with autophagosome acidification. Most activities are evolutionarily conserved. However, SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 antagonizes IFN signaling less efficiently than the orthologs of closely related RaTG13-CoV and SARS-CoV-1. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 proteins counteract autophagy and type I IFN more efficiently than type II or III IFN signaling, and infection experiments confirm potent inhibition by IFN-Î³ and -&#955;1.

Currently, we have a limited toolset available for visualizing SARS-CoV-2 in cells and tissues, particularly in tissues from patients who died from COVID-19. Generally, single-molecule RNA FISH techniques have shown mixed results in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues such as those preserved from human autopsies. Here, we present a platform for preparing autopsy tissue for visualizing SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RNA FISH with amplification by hybridization chain reaction (HCR). We developed probe sets that target different regions of SARS-CoV-2 (including ORF1a and N) as well as probe sets that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic mRNAs. We validated these probe sets in cell culture and tissues (lung, lymph node, and placenta) from infected patients. Using this technology, we observe distinct subcellular localization patterns of the ORF1a and N regions, with the ORF1a concentrated around the nucleus and the N showing a diffuse distribution across the cytoplasm. In human lung tissue, we performed multiplexed RNA FISH HCR for SARS-CoV-2 and cell-type specific marker genes. We found viral RNA in cells containing the alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell marker gene (SFTPC) and the alveolar macrophage marker gene (MARCO), but did not identify viral RNA in cells containing the alveolar type 1 (AT1) cell marker gene (AGER). Moreover, we observed distinct subcellular localization patterns of viral RNA in AT2 cells and alveolar macrophages, consistent with phagocytosis of infected cells. In sum, we demonstrate the use of RNA FISH HCR for visualizing different RNA species from SARS-CoV-2 in cell lines and FFPE autopsy specimens. Furthermore, we multiplex this assay with probes for cellular genes to determine what cell-types are infected within the lung. We anticipate that this platform could be broadly useful for studying SARS-CoV-2 pathology in tissues as well as extended for other applications including investigating the viral life cycle, viral diagnostics, and drug screening.","Acheampong, Kofi K; Schaff, Dylan L; Emert, Benjamin L; Lake, Jonathan; Reffsin, Sam; Shea, Emily K; Comar, Courtney E; Litzky, Leslie A; Khurram, Nigar A; Feldman, Michael; Weiss, Susan R; Montone, Kathleen T; Cherry, Sara; Shaffer, Sydney M",,461,24

As of July 2020, there have been more than 17 million cases worldwide. Determining multiple transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 is critical to improving safety practices for the public and stemming the spread of SARS-CoV-2 effectively. This article mainly focuses on published studies on the transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 including contact transmission, droplet transmission, aerosol transmission and fecal-oral transmission, as well as related research approaches, such as epidemiological investigations, environmental sampling in hospitals and laboratories and animal models. We also provide four specific recommendations for the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 that may help reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection under different environmental conditions. First, social distancing, rational use of face masks and respirators, eye protection, and hand disinfection for medical staff and the general public deserve further attention and promotion. Second, aerodynamic characteristics, such as size distribution, release regularity, aerosol diffusion, survival and decline, infectious dose and spread distance, still require further investigation in order to identify the transmissibility of COVID-19. Third, background monitoring of the distribution of pathogenic microorganisms and environmental disinfection in crowded public places, such as railway stations, schools, hospitals and other densely populated areas, can give early warning of outbreaks and curb the transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 in those high-risk areas. Forth, establishing novel predictive models can help us to not only assess transmission and impacts in communities, but also better implement corresponding emergency response measures.","Wang, Zhongyi; Fu, Yingying; Guo, Zhendong; Li, Jiaming; Li, Jingjing; Cheng, Hongliang; Lu, Bing; Sun, Qiang",Biochem Soc Trans,461,1

First, we use machine learning to remove the confounding effects of weather conditions on pollution concentrations. Second, we use a new augmented synthetic control method (Ben-Michael et al. in The augmented synthetic control method. University of California Berkeley, Mimeo, 2019. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04170.pdf) to estimate the impact of the lockdown on weather normalised pollution relative to a control group of cities that were not in lockdown. We find NO 2 concentrations fell by as much as 24 µ g/m 3 during the lockdown (a reduction of 63% from the pre-lockdown level), while PM10 concentrations fell by a similar amount but for a shorter period. The lockdown had no discernible impact on concentrations of SO 2 or CO. We calculate that the reduction of NO 2 concentrations could have prevented as many as 496 deaths in Wuhan city, 3368 deaths in Hubei province and 10,822 deaths in China as a whole.","Cole, Matthew A; Elliott, Robert J R; Liu, Bowen",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),461,15

The present study examines patterns of the first wave of Covid-19 morbidity in Israel at the macro level, during the period of late February to early June 2020, when the first wave has faded out. The analysis focuses on the significance of four sociodemographic variables: socioeconomic status, population density, rate of elderly population and minority status (Jewish / Arab identity) of the population in cities with 5000 residents or more. Additionally, we take a closer look into the association between morbidity rates and one SES component - home Internet access. METHODS: The article is a cross sectional study of morbidity rates, investigated on a residential community basis. Following the descriptive statistics, we move on to present multivariate analysis to explore associations between these variables and Covid-19 morbidity in Israel. RESULTS: Both the descriptive statistics and regressions show morbidity rates to be positively associated with population density. Socioeconomic status as well as the size of elderly population were both significantly related to morbidity, but only in Jewish communities. Interestingly, the association was inverse in both cases. i.e., the higher the SES the lower the morbidity and the larger the elderly population, the lower the community's morbidity. Another interesting result is that overall, morbidity rates in Jewish cities were consistently higher than in Arab communities. CONCLUSIONS: We attribute the low morbidity rates in communities with relatively small elderly populations to the exceptionally high fertility rates in ultra-orthodox communities that sustained increased rates of morbidity; the lower morbidity in Arab communities is attributed to several factors, including the spatial Jewish-Arab segregation.","Birenbaum-Carmeli, Daphna; Chassida, Judith",Int J Equity Health,461,23

When face-to-face follow-up is unavailable or undesirable, telepsychiatry becomes a promising alternative. This study aimed to investigate hospital- and county-level characteristics associated with telepsychiatry adoption. METHODS: Cross-sectional national data of 3475 acute care hospitals were derived from the 2017 American Hospital Association Annual Survey. Generalized linear regression models were used to identify characteristics associated with telepsychiatry adoption. RESULTS: About one-sixth (548 [15.8%]) of hospitals reported having telepsychiatry with a wide variation across states. Rural noncore hospitals were less likely to adopt telepsychiatry (8.3%) than hospitals in rural micropolitan (13.6%) and urban counties (19.4%). Hospitals with both outpatient and inpatient psychiatric care services (marginal difference [95% CI]: 16.0% [12.1% to 19.9%]) and hospitals only with outpatient psychiatric services (6.5% [3.7% to 9.4%]) were more likely to have telepsychiatry than hospitals with neither psychiatric services. Federal hospitals (48.9% [32.5 to 65.3%]), system-affiliated hospitals (3.9% [1.2% to 6.6%]), hospitals with larger bed size (Quartile IV vs. I: 6.2% [0.7% to 11.6%]), and hospitals with greater ratio of Medicaid inpatient days to total inpatient days (Quartile IV vs. I: 4.9% [0.3% to 9.4%]) were more likely to have telepsychiatry than their counterparts. Private non-profit hospitals (- 6.9% [- 11.7% to - 2.0%]) and hospitals in counties designated as whole mental health professional shortage areas (- 6.6% [- 12.7% to - 0.5%]) were less likely to have telepsychiatry. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, telepsychiatry adoption in US hospitals was low with substantial variations by urban and rural status and by state in 2017. This raises concerns about access to psychiatric services and continuity of care for patients discharged from hospitals.","Li, Zhong; Harrison, Sayward E; Li, Xiaoming; Hung, Peiyin",BMC Psychiatry,461,16

We have previously shown that endotoxemia, presumably from the gut, may complicate COVID-19. However, the role of endotoxin adsorbent (EA) therapy to mitigate organ dysfunction in COVID-19 has not been explored. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study in COVID-19 patients who received EA therapy at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between March 13 and April 17, 2020. Relevant clinical and laboratory data were collected by inpatient chart review. RESULTS: Among 147 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 6 patients received EA therapy. All of the 6 patients had severe COVID-19 infection with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Among these, 5 of them were mechanically ventilated and 4 had complications of secondary bacterial infection. The endotoxin activity assay (EAA) results of pre-EA therapy ranged from 0.47 to 2.79. The choices of EA therapy were at the discretion of attending physicians. One patient was treated with oXiris® along with continuous renal replacement therapy, and the others received polymyxin B hemoperfusion sessions. All patients have survived and were finally free from the mechanical ventilation as well as had improvement in PaO2/FiO2 ratio and decreased EAA level after EA therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the clinical improvement of severe COVID-19 patients with elevated EAA level upon receiving EA therapy. However, the benefit of EA therapy in COVID-19 ARDS is still unclear and needs to be elucidated with randomized controlled study.","Peerapornratana, Sadudee; Sirivongrangson, Phatadon; Tungsanga, Somkanya; Tiankanon, Kanitha; Kulvichit, Win; Putcharoen, Opass; Kellum, John A; Srisawat, Nattachai",Blood Purif,461,16

To address these problems associated with cell-based therapy, MSC exosome therapy was developed and has shown promising clinical outcomes. MSC exosomes are nanosized vesicles secreted from MSCs and represent a non-cellular therapeutic agent. MSC exosomes retain therapeutic features of the cells from which they originated including genetic material, lipids, and proteins. Similar to MSCs, exosomes can induce cell differentiation, immunoregulation, angiogenesis, and tumor suppression. MSC exosomes have therefore been employed in several experimental models and clinical studies. Here, we review the therapeutic potential of MSC-derived exosomes and summarize currently ongoing clinical trials according to disease type. In addition, we propose several functional enhancement strategies for the effective clinical application of MSC exosome therapy.","Lee, Byung-Chul; Kang, Insung; Yu, Kyung-Rok",,461,31

Severe courses may present as ARDS. Several publications report a high incidence of coagulation abnormalities in these patients. We aimed to compare coagulation and inflammation parameters in patients with ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 infection versus patients with ARDS due to other causes. METHODS: This retrospective study included intubated patients admitted with the diagnosis of ARDS to the ICU at Munich university hospital. 22 patients had confirmed SARS-CoV2-infection (COVID-19 group), 14 patients had bacterial or other viral pneumonia (control group). Demographic, clinical parameters and laboratory tests including coagulation parameters and thromboelastometry were analysed. RESULTS: No differences were found in gender ratios, BMI, Horovitz quotients and haemoglobin values. The median SOFA score, serum lactate levels, renal function parameters (creatinine, urea) and all inflammation markers (IL-6, PCT, CRP) were lower in the COVID-19 group (all: p < 0.05). INR (p < 0.001) and antithrombin (p < 0.001) were higher in COVID-19 patients. D-dimer levels (p = 0.004) and consecutively the DIC score (p = 0.003) were lower in this group.

Mechanical forces are implicated in the progression of emphysema that is a major pathologic feature of COPD. We hypothesized that resistive breathing exacerbates emphysema. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 0.75 units of pancreatic porcine elastase intratracheally to develop emphysema. Resistive breathing was applied by suturing a nylon band around the trachea to reduce surface area to half for the last 24 or 72 hours of a 21-day time period after elastase treatment in total. Following RB (24 or 72 hours), lung mechanics were measured and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. Emphysema was quantified by the mean linear intercept (Lm) and the destructive index (DI) in lung tissue sections. Results: Following 21 days of intratracheal elastase exposure, Lm and DI increased in lung tissue sections [Lm (µm), control 39.09±0.76, elastase 62.05±2.19, p=0.003 and DI, ctr 30.95±2.75, elastase 73.12±1.75, p<0.001]. RB for 72 hours further increased Lm by 64% and DI by 19%, compared to elastase alone (p<0.001 and p=0.02, respectively). RB induced BAL neutrophilia in elastase-treated mice. Static compliance (Cst) increased in elastase-treated mice [Cst (mL/cmH2O), control 0.067±0.001, elastase 0.109±0.006, p<0.001], but superimposed RB decreased Cst, compared to elastase alone [Cst (mL/cmH2O), elastase+RB24h 0.090±0.004, p=0.006 to elastase, elastase+RB72h 0.090±0.005, p=0.006 to elastase]. Conclusion: Resistive breathing augments pulmonary inflammation and emphysema in an elastase-induced emphysema mouse model.","Toumpanakis, Dimitrios; Mizi, Eleftheria; Vassilakopoulou, Vyronia; Dettoraki, Maria; Chatzianastasiou, Athanasia; Perlikos, Fotis; Giatra, Georgia; Moscholaki, Marina; Theocharis, Stamatios; Vassilakopoulos, Theodoros",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,461,16

Despite an incidence rate of 0.02% in the vaccine arm of the Moderna mRNA-1273 trial, concerns have been expressed about the association of adverse reactions following soft tissue filler injections and the COVID-19 vaccines. The International Society for Dermatologic and Aesthetic Surgery (ISDS) understands these concerns and has designed the following study. METHODS: A global survey was designed to capture the incidence of adverse events related to: (1) previous soft tissue filler injections, (2) soft tissue filler injections during positive testing for COVID-19, and (3) soft tissue filler injections during and after receiving any of the COVID-19 vaccines globally available. RESULTS: The information of 106 survey participants from 18 different countries was analyzed. 80.2% (n=85) never experienced any adverse reaction following their soft tissue filler injection whereas 15.1% (n=16) experienced swelling and 4.7% (n=5) experienced pain that lasted longer than two days. Of those who received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (n=78), 94.9% reported not to have experienced any adverse reaction related to their previous soft tissue filler injection, whereas 5.1% (n=4) reported to have perceived pain that lasted longer than two days. CONCLUSION: The data collected does not support the concern for an increased risk of developing adverse reactions following soft tissue filler injections associated with the COVID-19 vaccines compared to that risk associated with other previously described triggers or the default risk following soft tissue filler injections.

Hospitalisation offers an opportunity for physicians to initiate ACP conversations. Despite expert recommendations, hospital-based physicians (hospitalists) do not routinely engage in these conversations, reserving them for the critically ill.The objective of this study is to test the effect of a novel behavioural intervention on the incidence of ACP conversations by hospitalists practicing at a stratified random sample of hospitals drawn from 220 US acute care hospitals staffed by a large, nationwide acute care physician practice with an ongoing ACP quality improvement initiative. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We developed Hopewell Hospitalist, a theory-based adventure video game, to modify physicians' attitudes towards ACP conversations and to increase their motivation for engaging in them. The planned study is a pragmatic stepped-wedge crossover phase III trial, testing the efficacy of Hopewell Hospitalist for increasing ACP conversations. We will randomise 40 hospitals to the month (step) in which they receive the intervention. We aim to recruit 30 hospitalists from up to eight hospitals each step to complete the intervention, playing Hopewell Hospitalist for at least 2 hours. The primary outcome is ACP billing for patients aged 65 and older managed by participating hospitalists. We hypothesise that the intervention will increase ACP billing in the quarter after dissemination, and have 80% power to detect a 1% absolute increase and 99% power to detect a 3.5% absolute increase. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Dartmouth's Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects has approved the study protocol, which is registered on clinicaltrials.gov. We will disseminate the results through manuscripts and the trials website. Hopewell Hospitalist will be made available on the iOS Application Store for download, free of cost, at the conclusion of the trial.

It is essential to understand vaccine hesitancy among SNF workers to inform vaccine campaigns going forward. OBJECTIVE: To describe the concerns raised among healthcare workers and staff from SNFs during town hall meetings. DESIGN: Sixty-three SNFs from four corporations were invited to send Opinion Leaders, outspoken staff from nursing, nurse aid, dietary, housekeeping or recreational therapy, to attend a 1-h virtual town hall meeting. Meetings used a similar format where the moderator solicited concerns that the attendees themselves had or had heard from others in the facility about the COVID-19 vaccine. Physicians and moderators used personal stories to address concerns and reaffirmed positive emotions. SETTING: Twenty-six video town hall meetings with SNF staff. PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare workers and staff, with physicians serving as content experts. MEASUREMENT: Questions and comments about the COVID-19 vaccines noted by physicians. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety three staff from 50 facilities participated in 26 meetings between December 30, 2020 and January 15, 2021. Most staff reported getting information about the vaccine from friends or social media. Concerns about how rapidly the vaccines were developed and side effects, including infertility or pregnancy related concerns, were frequently raised. There were no differences in concerns raised by discipline. Questions about returning to prior activities after being vaccinated were common and offered the opportunity to build on positive emotions to reduce vaccine hesitancy. CONCLUSIONS: Misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine was widespread among SNF staff. Sharing positive emotions and stories may be more effective than sharing data when attempting to reduce vaccine hesitancy in SNF staff.","Berry, Sarah D; Johnson, Kimberly S; Myles, Lonnita; Herndon, Laurie; Montoya, Ana; Fashaw, Shekinah; Gifford, David",J Am Geriatr Soc,461,30

The main question is how Israeli sex workers perceive the public debate over governing the Israeli sex industry. Methods: This study combines qualitative methods that include ethnographic observations and interviews. The ethnographic observations were carried out between November 2018 and October 2019 in gatherings, protests, and academic conferences where sex workers were the lead speakers. In addition, 16 in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with sex workers across various indoor sectors, and four interviews were conducted with political figures to learn about their efforts to adopt neo-abolitionist legislation. Results: the Israeli legislative proceedings initiated in 2007 deny sex workers a voice and exclude them from the political space and policy debates that have a direct bearing on their working lives and wellbeing. Thus, Israeli sex workers perceive sex work governance as controlling their agency and deepening their stigmatization. In this process, we show how contrasting groups became strange bedfellows in their attempt to protect sex workers by incriminating clients of the sex industry. Conclusions: We conclude that the binary framings of debates about sex work in Israel do not address the actual needs or political desires of sex workers who are ignored and excluded from the discourse about them. Policy Implications: Furthermore, we conclude that the issue at hand is not about permitting sex workers to express their views but rather about the need to listen to their critiques to ensure that policy is built on their knowledge and experience.","Levy-Aronovic, Stephanie; Lahav-Raz, Yeela; Raz, Aviad",Sex Res Social Policy,461,24

The large amounts of epidemiological data and the wealth of information deriving from animal models of gestational infections have contributed to delineate, in the last years, possible underpinning mechanisms for this phenomenon, including defects in neuronal migration, impaired spine and synaptic development, and altered activation of microglia. Recently, dysfunctions of the neurovascular unit and anomalies of the brain vasculature have unexpectedly emerged as potential causes at the origin of behavioral abnormalities and psychiatric disorders consequent to prenatal and perinatal infections. This review aims to discuss the up-to-date literature evidence pointing to the neurovascular unit and brain vasculature damages as the etiological mechanisms in neurodevelopmental syndromes.

Thus, a comprehensive investigation of DON's spatial distribution and its association with DBP occurrence in the surface water is urgently needed. In this study, a total of 51 water samples were collected from two rivers and four lakes in May 2020 in Wuhan to explore the regional variation of nitrogen (N) species, DON's compositional characteristics, and the three classes of DBP occurrence. In lakes, 53.0% to 86.3% of N existed as DON, with its concentration varying between 0.3-4.0 mg N/L. In contrast, NO3--N was the dominant N species in rivers. Spectral analysis revealed that DON in the lakes contained higher humic and fulvic materials with higher A254, A253/A203, SUVA254, and PIII+IV/PI+II+V ratios, while rivers had higher levels of hydrophilic compounds. Trihalomethanes (THMs) were the most prevalent DBPs in the surface waters, followed by N-nitrosamines and haloacetonitriles (HANs). The levels of N-nitrosamines (23.1-97.4 ng/L) increased significantly after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Excessive DON in the surface waters was responsible for the formation of N-nitrosamines. This study confirmed that the presence of DON in surface water could result in DBP formation, especially N-nitrosamines, when disinfectants were discharged into surface water during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wang, Leyun; Zhang, Xian; Chen, Shanshan; Meng, Fanbin; Zhang, Dayi; Liu, Yi; Li, Miao; Liu, Xiang; Huang, Xia; Qu, Jiuhui",Water Res,461,10

So far, viral targets of cellular immunity and factors determining successful mounting of T cell responses are poorly defined. We therefore analyzed cellular responses to membrane, nucleocapsid, and spike proteins in individuals suffering from moderate or severe infection and in individuals who recovered from mild disease. We demonstrate that the CoV-2-specific CD4+ T helper cell response is directed against all 3 proteins with comparable magnitude, ex vivo proliferation, and portions of responding patients. However, individuals who died were more likely to have not mounted a cellular response to the proteins. Higher patient age and comorbidity index correlated with increased frequencies of CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells, harboring higher portions of IL-2-secreting, but lower portions of IFN-Î³-secreting, cells. Diminished frequencies of membrane protein-reactive IFN-Î³+ T cells were particularly associated with higher acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II scores in patients admitted to intensive care. CoV-2-specific T cells exhibited elevated PD-1 expression in patients with active disease as compared with those individuals who recovered from previous mild disease.

Limited data exists regarding the involvement of cardiovascular system in COVID-19 patients. We sought to evaluate the cardiovascular (CV) complications and its impact on outcomes in symptomatic COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This was a single center observational study among symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Data regarding clinical profile, laboratory investigations, CV complications, treatment and outcomes were collected. Cardiac biomarkers and 12 lead electrocardiograms were done in all while echocardiography was done in those with clinical indications for the same. Corrected QT-interval (QTc) at baseline and maximum value during hospitalization were computed. RESULTS: Of the 108 patients, majority of them were males with a mean age of 51.2 ± 17.7 years. Hypertension (38%) and diabetes (32.4%) were most prevalent co-morbidities. ECG findings included sinus tachycardia in 18 (16.9%), first degree AV block in 5 (4.6%), VT/VF in 2 (1.8%) and sinus bradycardia in one (0.9%). QTc prolongation was observed in 17.6% subjects. CV complications included acute cardiac injury in 25.9%, heart failure, cardiogenic shock and acute coronary syndrome in 3.7% each, ""probable"" myocarditis in 2.8% patients. Patients with acute cardiac injury had higher mortality than those without (16/28 [57.1%] vs 14/78 [17.5%]; P < 0.0001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that acute cardiac injury (OR: 11.3), lymphopenia (OR: 4.91), use of inotropic agents (OR: 2.46) and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (OR:1.1) were independent predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: CV complications such as acute cardiac injury is common in COVID-19 patients and is associated with worse prognosis.","Kunal, Shekhar; Sharma, Shashi Mohan; Sharma, Sohan Kumar; Gautam, Dinesh; Bhatia, Harnish; Mahla, Himanshu; Sharma, Sandeep; Bhandari, Sudhir",Indian Heart J,461,24

In this present study, we have predicted the reported bioactive flavonoids and triterpenoids of the plant against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike protein, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2) receptor and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP4) receptor through molecular docking and in silico ADME predictions methods. According to the binding affinities, the two triterpenoids, hederagenin and oleanolic acid exhibited the best docking scores with these proteins than the catechin and quercetin with compared to standard remdesivir, favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine. The in vitro protein-drug studies have also showed significant interaction of catechin and quercetin compounds than standard drugs. The in silico binding studies correlated with the in silico binding studies. Further, M. dioica being used as antidiabetic and its metabolite had significant interaction with DDP4, a comorbidity protein involved in aiding the viral entry. Out of all the natural ligands, quercetin was reported relatively good and safe for humans with high gastrointestinal tract permeability and poor blood brain barrier crossing abilities.

How the lockdown modified older adults' physical activity (PA) has been poorly described. This research assesses the effect of the lockdown on PA levels and identifies predictors of sufficient/insufficient PA in frail older community-dwellers. Community-dwelling participants from the +ÀGIL Barcelona frailty intervention program, suspended during the pandemic, underwent a phone-assessment during the lockdown. PA was measured before and after the lockdown using the Brief Physical Activity Assessment Tool (BPAAT). We included 98 frail older adults free of COVID-19 (mean age = 82.7 years, 66.3% women, mean Short Physical Performance Battery = 8.1 points). About one third of participants (32.2%) were not meeting sufficient PA levels at the end of the lockdown. Depressive symptoms (OR = 0.12, CI95% = 0.02-0.55) and fatigue (OR = 0.11, CI95% = 0.03-0.44) decreased the odds of maintaining sufficient PA, whereas maintaining social networks (OR = 5.07, CI95% = 1.60-16.08) and reading (OR = 6.29, CI95% = 1.66-23.90) increased it. Living alone was associated with the reduction of PA levels (b = -1.30, CI95% = -2.14--0.46). In our sample, pre-lockdown mental health, frailty-related symptoms and social relationships were consistently associated with both PA levels during-lockdown and pre-post change.

The mathematical model can help when these intervention measures are the best strategies for disease control as well as how they might affect the disease dynamics. Motivated by this, in this article, we have formulated a mathematical model introducing a quarantine class and governmental intervention measures to mitigate disease transmission. We study a thorough dynamical behavior of the model in terms of the basic reproduction number. Further, we perform the sensitivity analysis of the essential reproduction number and found that reducing the contact of exposed and susceptible humans is the most critical factor in achieving disease control. To lessen the infected individuals as well as to minimize the cost of implementing government control measures, we formulate an optimal control problem, and optimal control is determined. Finally, we forecast a short-term trend of COVID-19 for the three highly affected states, Maharashtra, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu, in India, and it suggests that the first two states need further monitoring of control measures to reduce the contact of exposed and susceptible humans.","Mandal, Manotosh; Jana, Soovoojeet; Nandi, Swapan Kumar; Khatua, Anupam; Adak, Sayani; Kar, T K",Chaos Solitons Fractals,461,5

OBJECTIVE: To identify factors impacting the health-related-quality of life (HRQOL) among Italian patients affected by PADs switched to remote assistance at the time of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. METHODS: The quality of life was surveyed in 158 patients with PADs by the Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life questionnaire, a disease-specific tool, and by the 12-item General Health Questionnaire, a generic tool to assess the risk of anxiety/depression. Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic, we shifted all patients with PADs to home therapy, and activated remote visits. Questionnaires were sent by email 4 weeks later. Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life questionnaire and 12-item General Health Questionnaire data scores were compared with the same set of data from a survey done in 2017. RESULTS: Of 210 patients, 158 (75%) agreed to participate. The quality of life was worse in the group of patients who were at risk of anxiety/depression at the study time. HRQOL was similar in patients forced to shift from hospital-based to home-based immunoglobulin treatment and in patients who continued their usual home-based replacement. The risk of anxiety/depression is associated with pandemia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and with patients' fragility, and not with related clinical conditions associated with common variable immune deficiencies.

This framing focuses on the medical sciences (e.g. public health) and social sciences (e.g. tourism management) to identify gaps between medical scientific knowledge and public awareness in the context of COVID-19. The authors' experience in public health and tourism management further demonstrates a missing link between academic research and the information made available in public health and everyday settings. A potential research agenda is proposed accordingly. Findings: This paper summarizes how salient issues related to knowledge transfer can become intensified during a global pandemic, such as medical research not being communicated in plain language, which leads some citizens to feel apathetic about findings. Reporting on the prevalence and anticipated consequences of disease outbreaks can hence be difficult, especially early in the development of diseases such as COVID-19. Research limitations/implications: By assuming a cross-disciplinary perspective on medical/health and social science research, this paper encourages academic and practical collaboration to bring medical research to the masses. This paper also outlines several research directions to promote public health, safety and sustainability through tourism. Practical implications: This paper highlights that it is essential for medical knowledge to be disseminated in a manner that promotes public understanding. The tourism and hospitality industry can benefit from an essential understanding of medical findings, particularly during this pandemic. Without a firm grasp on COVID-19's origins and treatment, the tourism and hospitality industry will likely struggle to recover from this catastrophe. Social implications: Taking COVID-19 as a case in point, this study advocates leveraging the strengths of disparate domains to bring medical findings to a wider audience and showcase cutting-edge developments for the greater good. This study also emphasizes the importance of engaging the general public in reputable scientific research findings to increase public awareness in a professional and accurate manner. Originality/value: This paper presents a unique and critical discussion of the gap between medical science knowledge and public awareness, as well as its implications for tourism and hospitality recovery after COVID-19, with a focus on applying medical scientific knowledge to post-pandemic industry recovery. © 2021, Jun Wen, Haifeng Hou, Metin Kozak, Fang Meng, Chung-En Yu and Wei Wang.","Wen, J.; Hou, H.; Kozak, M.; Meng, F.; Yu, C.

In several recent studies, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been demonstrated to be the cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2 as it was previously well known as the receptor of SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 can bind with high affinity to human ACE2 and engages it as an entry receptor. It seems that the genetic, notably epigenetic variations of ACE2 are less known in different populations, indicating the need for its further investigation. These variations have the potential to affect its contribution to the pathogenicity of COVID-19. The contribution of epigenetics in the interindividual variability of ACE2 merits more attention because epigenetic processes can play important roles in ACE2 alterations in various tissues and different people and populations. Analyzing different DNA methylation patterns and microRNAs, contributing to the ACE2 modulation in the lungs will have a high priority. The epigenetic and genetic variations of ACE2 become even more important when considering that some people have mild clinical symptoms despite having COVID-19. The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is complex; therefore, a better understanding of the underlying pathobiology, especially binding the virus to its receptors, could help improve therapeutic and preventive approaches. This review aims to highlight the importance of evaluating both the epigenetic and genetic variations of ACE2 as a receptor for the deadly SARS-CoV-2.","Kianmehr, Anvarsadat; Faraoni, Isabella; Kucuk, Omer; Mahrooz, Abdolkarim",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,461,22

Potentially, reduced out-of-home mobility and lower activity levels among older people may lower their quality of life (QOL). We studied cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of and changes in life-space mobility, active ageing and QOL during COVID-19 social distancing compared to two years before. METHODS: Altogether 809 community-living participants initially aged 75, 80 or 85 years of our active aging study (AGNES) conducted in 2017-2018 took part in the current AGNES-COVID-19 survey in May and June 2020. Outdoor mobility was assessed with the Life-Space Assessment (range 0-120). Active approach to life was assessed with the University of Jyväskylä Active Aging Scale (range 0-272), and QOL with the shortened Older People's Quality of Life Questionnaire (range13-65; higher scores better for all). Data were analyzed with General Estimating Equations, General Linear Models, and Oneway-ANOVA. RESULTS: Life-space mobility (B -10.8, SE 0.75, p<0.001), the active ageing score (B -24.1, SE 0.88, p<0.001) and the QOL score (B -1.65, SE 0.21, p<0.001) were lower during COVID-19 social distancing vs. two years before. Concurrent life-space mobility and active ageing scores, age and sex explained 48% of QOL at the baseline and 42% during social distancing. Longitudinally, steeper declines in all three variables coincided. CONCLUSIONS: The observed declines indicate compliance with social distancing recommendation, but underline the importance of participation in meaningful life situations as a factor underlying good QOL also during COVID-19 pandemic.","Rantanen, Taina; Eronen, Johanna; Kauppinen, Markku; Kokko, Katja; Sanaslahti, Sini; Kajan, Niina; Portegijs, Erja","J. gerontol.

According to the literature, images of hand and fingers can support telediagnosis in hand emergencies. We present this feasibility study on online video consultation in hand surgery. METHODS: A structured examination was designed to query the medical history and examine motor skills, sensitivity, strength and function tests of the hand. Thirty examinations on both hands were carried out by online video consultation, then in direct contact and compared with each other. RESULTS: With 4560 evaluated range of movement of the hand and finger joints, there was a high correlation between the measurement methods of R = 0.995 (p < 0.0001, confidence interval 0.9946â-â0.9954). In the video-based examination, 84.6% of the measured values showed a deviation of less than 5° compared to the direct examination, 92.8% less than 10° deviation. Good accordance was also found in the patient's medical history. An estimating examination of sensitivity, function and strength during video examination is feasible with simple auxiliary aids. Deficits are evident in the detection of scars, in function tests and the absence of haptic findings. CONCLUSION: Online video consultation allows hand examination with sufficient documentation of hand and finger movements (range of motion) and proper evaluation of symptoms. It cannot replace direct examination but complement patient care in hand surgery even beyond the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Welle, Kristian; Täger, Stefan; Hackenberg, Roslind Karolina; Markowetz, Alexander; Schildberg, Frank Alexander; Burger, Christof; Wirtz, Dieter Christian; Jansen, Tom; Kabir, Koroush",Z. orthop. unfallchirurgie,461,21

It is therefore crucial to clarify this aspect, considering its implications in the development of successful surveillance strategies, therapies, and vaccinations. The aim of this study was to assess the antibody response in a children group after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to compare it with that of their parents affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. We enrolled 12 children and their parents, both groups being affected by COVID-19 in April 2020. In the children's group, we collected real-time RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values and gene characterization of first nasal-throat swab at the time of diagnosis (T0); 30 days after the diagnosis (T30), we performed blood tests to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG. Finally, 180 days after the diagnosis (T180), we measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in both children and parents. In children, antibody levels declined significantly at 180 days (T180) after first measurement (T30). There were no significant differences in IgG level related to age, sex, and clinical manifestations. We found a significant correlation between IgG titers at T30 and Ct value of gene N. Children showed a lower level of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at T180 compared to their parents.Conclusion: Antibody responses in children waned 180 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and at the same time, their parents showed a different antibody response to the virus. These results highlight that serological tests should be used with caution in surveillance strategies among the general population. What is known: â¢ Currently is not known how long antibody response will be maintained or if it protects from reinfection. â¢ Recent reports in adults suggest that antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 declined several months after infection, but data are missing in pediatric age. What is new: â¢ We showed that antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 wane several months after infection also in children with quantitative differences in antibody levels between children and adults. â¢ In this context, serological tests should be used with caution in surveillance strategies.","Bloise, Silvia; Marcellino, Alessia; Testa, Alessia; Dilillo, Anna; Mallardo, Saverio; Isoldi, Sara; Martucci, Vanessa; Sanseviero, Maria Teresa; Del Giudice, Emanuela; Iorfida, Donatella; Ventriglia, Flavia; Lubrano, Riccardo",Eur. j. pediatr,461,17

However, major depressive disorder may also cause temporary deterioration of one's cognition known as pseudodementia. Differentiating a true dementia and pseudodementia is still difficult even for an experienced clinician and extensive and careful examinations must be performed. Although mental disorders such as depression and dementia have been studied, there is still no solution for shorter and undemanding pseudodementia screening. This study inspects the distribution and statistical characteristics from both dementia patient and depression patient, and compared them. It is found that some acoustic features were shared in both dementia and depression, albeit their correlation was reversed. Statistical significance was also found when comparing the features. Additionally, the possibility of utilizing machine learning for automatic pseudodementia screening was explored. The machine learning part includes feature selection using LASSO algorithm and support vector machine (SVM) with linear kernel as the predictive model with age-matched symptomatic depression patient and dementia patient as the database. High accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity was obtained in both training session and testing session. The resulting model was also tested against other datasets that were not included and still performs considerably well. These results imply that dementia and depression might be both detected and differentiated based on acoustic features alone. Automated screening is also possible based on the high accuracy of machine learning results.","Sumali, Brian; Mitsukura, Yasue; Liang, Kuo-Ching; Yoshimura, Michitaka; Kitazawa, Momoko; Takamiya, Akihiro; Fujita, Takanori; Mimura, Masaru; Kishimoto, Taishiro",,461,16

With infections soaring rapidly, users took to Twitter asking people to self isolate and quarantine themselves. Users also demanded closure of schools, bars, and restaurants as well as lockdown of cities and states. We methodically collect tweets by identifying and tracking trending COVID-related hashtags. We first manually group the hashtags into six main categories, namely, 1) General COVID, 2) Quarantine, 3) Panic Buying, 4) School Closures, 5) Lockdowns, and 6) Frustration and Hope}, and study the temporal evolution of tweets in these hashtags. We conduct a linguistic analysis of words common to all hashtag groups and specific to each hashtag group and identify the chief concerns of people as the pandemic gripped the nation (e.g., exploring bidets as an alternative to toilet paper). We conduct sentiment analysis and our investigation reveals that people reacted positively to school closures and negatively to the lack of availability of essential goods due to panic buying. We adopt a state-of-the-art semantic role labeling approach to identify the action words and then leverage a LSTM-based dependency parsing model to analyze the context of action words (e.g., verb deal is accompanied by nouns such as anxiety, stress, and crisis). Finally, we develop a scalable seeded topic modeling approach to automatically categorize and isolate tweets into hashtag groups and experimentally validate that our topic model provides a grouping similar to our manual grouping.

These tools have grown in use together with the rise in enrollments in computer science programs and the widespread availability of code on-line. Educators rely on the robustness of plagiarism detection tools; the working assumption is that the effort required to evade detection is as high as that required to actually do the assigned work. This paper shows this is not the case. It presents an entirely automatic program transformation approach, Mossad, that defeats popular software plagiarism detection tools. Mossad comprises a framework that couples techniques inspired by genetic programming with domain-specific knowledge to effectively undermine plagiarism detectors. Mossad is effective at defeating four plagiarism detectors, including Moss and JPlag. Mossad is both fast and effective: it can, in minutes, generate modified versions of programs that are likely to escape detection. More insidiously, because of its non-deterministic approach, Mossad can, from a single program, generate dozens of variants, which are classified as no more suspicious than legitimate assignments. A detailed study of Mossad across a corpus of real student assignments demonstrates its efficacy at evading detection. A user study shows that graduate student assistants consistently rate Mossad-generated code as just as readable as authentic student code. This work motivates the need for both research on more robust plagiarism detection tools and greater integration of naturally plagiarism-resistant methodologies like code review into computer science education.","Devore-McDonald, Breanna; Berger, Emery D.",,461,16

Specifically, it analyzes the effects of different types of sport activities, including nature-based, natural resource-using, and nature-neutral sport activities and different types of environmentally sustainable behaviors such as recycling, ecological consumption, energy-saving, and mobility on subjective well-being. The study conducts comparisons between the period before the COVID-19 pandemic and during the first lockdown in Germany. Quantitative survey data were collected using a convenience sampling approach (n = 412). Sport activities were captured with the number of hours spent on nature-based, natural resource-using, and nature-neutral activities. Environmentally sustainable behaviors were measured across four areas, including recycling, ecological consumption, energy-saving, and mobility. Subjective well-being was measured using the scale of the World Health Organization (WHO-5). Differences between the periods before and during COVID-19 were analyzed using t-tests. A set of multivariate regression models were estimated with subjective well-being as the dependent variable and sport activities, environmentally sustainable behaviors, and socio-demographics as independent variables. The results show that nature-based and nature-neutral sport activities significantly decreased during the first COVID-19 lockdown, while environmentally sustainable behaviors increased. The regression analyses reveal that nature-based and nature-neutral sport activities as well as ecological consumption significantly added to individuals' subjective well-being in the pre- and during-COVID-19-period. A decrease in nature-based and nature-neutral sport activities significantly predicted a decrease in individuals' subjective well-being.

Based on 12,042 fully completed questionnaires, we find that higher intention to get vaccinated is associated with men, older respondents, physicians and medical students, respondents who got the influenza vaccination, those who knew someone who had gotten hospitalised or died from COVID-19 and those who have more trust in experts, institutions and vaccines. Nurses and technicians were less likely to get vaccinated. In answers to an open question, sceptics were split into those doubting the quality due to the rapid development of the vaccine and those that reported personal experiences with side effects of prior vaccinations. Although the Slovenian population is diverse in its attitudes towards vaccination, the results are comparable to those found in other countries.

SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is an attractive candidate for a vaccine, antibodies, and inhibitors development because of the many roles it plays in attachment, fusion and entry into the host cell. In the present investigation, we characterized the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein by immunoinformatics techniques to put forward potential B and T cell epitopes, followed by the use of epitopes in construction of a multi-epitope peptide vaccine construct (MEPVC). The MEPVC revealed robust host immune system simulation with high production of immunoglobulins, cytokines and interleukins. Stable conformation of the MEPVC with a representative innate immune TLR3 receptor was observed involving strong hydrophobic and hydrophilic chemical interactions, along with enhanced contribution from salt-bridges towards inter-molecular stability. Molecular dynamics simulation in aqueous milieu aided further in interpreting strong affinity of the MEPVC for TLR3. This stability is the attribute of several vital residues from both TLR3 and MEPVC as shown by radial distribution function (RDF) and a novel axial frequency distribution (AFD) analytical tool. Comprehensive binding free energies estimation was provided at the end that concluded major domination by electrostatic and minor from van der Waals.

Many difficulties are faced by human beings to prevent the spread of the corona virus. However, this unexpected evolution of COVID-19 has also thrown many challenges to scientists and researchers so as to develop technologies that can be used to combat COVID-19. In the effort to combat COVID-19, many research universities and academic laboratories are also contributing by developing many technologies like Facing masks, hand sanitizers, hand washing machines, etc., to control and prevent the spread of COVID-19 disease. The use of Nano-materials is proving to be very effective in prevention, detection and diagnosis of COVID-19. In this paper many such technologies that are used to combat COVID-19 are also discussed. Some of the technologies like the germ trap technology used in face masks and hoods are also discussed. The use of nano-coatings, nano materials like graphene and carbon nano materials is playing a key role in preventing the spread of the virus. Antimicrobial nano-materials like silver nanoparticles are also effectively contributing to preventing the spread of the virus. Nano bio-sensors and gold nanoparticles are used in RT-PCR (Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) testing devices which are used for detection of coronavirus. The use of many nano chemicals and compounds has helped in making vaccines and anti-viral drugs that are today showing a way to safeguard human beings against the attack of this deadly virus.","B Ramaiah, Gurumurthy; Tegegne, Asmamaw; Melese, Bahiru",,461,24

Metagenomic sequencing rapidly revealed the causative agent of this outbreak to be a novel coronavirus - SARS-CoV-2. Herein, to provide a snapshot of the pathogens in pneumonia-associated respiratory samples from Wuhan prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, we collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 408 patients presenting with pneumonia and acute respiratory infections at the Central Hospital of Wuhan between 2016 and 2017. Unbiased total RNA sequencing was performed to reveal their ""total infectome"", including viruses, bacteria and fungi. Consequently, we identified 37 pathogen species, comprising 15 RNA viruses, 3 DNA viruses, 16 bacteria and 3 fungi, often at high abundance and including multiple co-infections (12.8%). However, SARS-CoV-2 was not present. These data depict a stable core infectome comprising common respiratory pathogens such as rhinoviruses and influenza viruses, an atypical respiratory virus (EV-D68), and a single case of a sporadic zoonotic pathogen - Chlamydia psittaci. Samples from patients experiencing respiratory disease on average had higher pathogen abundance than healthy controls. Phylogenetic analyses of individual pathogens revealed multiple origins and global transmission histories, highlighting the connectedness of the Wuhan population. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the pathogens associated with acute respiratory infections and pneumonia, which were more diverse and complex than obtained using targeted PCR or qPCR approaches.

N/OFQ and its receptor, NOP, are enriched in dopaminergic pathways, and intra-ventricular agonist delivery decreases dopamine levels in the dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens (NAc), and ventral tegmental area (VTA). We used whole cell electrophysiology in acute rat midbrain slices to investigate synaptic actions of N/OFQ. N/OFQ was primarily inhibitory, causing outward currents in both immunocytochemically identified dopaminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase positive (TH(+)) and non-dopaminergic (TH(-)) VTA neurons (effect at 1 µM: 20 ± 4 pA). Surprisingly, this effect was mediated by augmentation of postsynaptic GABAAR currents, unlike the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), where the N/OFQ induced outward currents were K+ channel dependent. A smaller population, 19% of all VTA neurons, responded to low concentrations N/OFQ with inward currents (10 nM: -11 ± 2 pA). Following 100 nM N/OFQ, the response to a second N/OFQ application was markedly diminished in VTA neurons (14 ± 10% of first response), but not in SNc neurons (90 ± 20% of first response). N/OFQ generated outward currents in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-projecting VTA neurons, but inward currents in a subset of posterior anterior cingulate cortex-projecting VTA neurons. While N/OFQ inhibited NAc-projecting VTA cell bodies, it had little effect on electrically or optogenetically evoked terminal dopamine release in the NAc measured ex vivo with fast scan cyclic voltammetry. These results extend our understanding of the N/OFQ system in brainstem circuits implicated in many neurobehavioral disorders.Significance statement The neuropeptide nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) and its receptor (NOP) are engaged under conditions of stress and are associated with reward processing disorders. Both peptide and receptor are highly enriched in ventral tegmental area (VTA) pathways underlying motivation and reward. Using whole cell electrophysiology in rat midbrain slices we found: 1) NOPs are functional on both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic VTA neurons; 2) N/OFQ differentially regulates VTA neurons based on neuroanatomical projection target; and 3) repeated application of N/OFQ produces evidence of receptor desensitization in VTA but not SNc neurons. These results reveal candidate mechanisms by which the NOP system regulates motivation and emotion.","Driscoll, Joseph R; Wallace, Tanya L; Mansourian, Kasra A; Martin, William J; Margolis, Elyssa B",ENeuro,461,16

As the pandemic has been shifting locations rapidly, individual studies have been at risk of failing to meet recruitment targets because of declining numbers of eligible patients with COVID-19 encountered at participating sites. It has become clear that it might take several more COVID-19 surges at the same location to achieve full enrollment and to find answers about what treatments are effective for this disease. This paper proposes an innovative approach for pooling patient-level data from multiple ongoing randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that have not been configured as a network of sites. We present the statistical analysis plan of a prospective individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis (MA) from ongoing RCTs of convalescent plasma (CP). We employ an adaptive Bayesian approach for continuously monitoring the accumulating pooled data via posterior probabilities for safety, efficacy, and harm. Although we focus on RCTs for CP and address specific challenges related to CP treatment for COVID-19, the proposed framework is generally applicable to pooling data from RCTs for other therapies and disease settings in order to find answers in weeks or months, rather than years.","Goldfeld, Keith S; Wu, Danni; Tarpey, Thaddeus; Liu, Mengling; Wu, Yinxiang; Troxel, Andrea B; Petkova, Eva",Stat. med,461,16

The current economic downturn is unprecedented and involves many companies and industries that have faced new, previously unknown challenges and threats. The objective of the article is to identify the most important risks and their resources based on the empirical research carried out in small and medium-sized enterprises in Poland. The formulated objective was accomplished using the data collection method, i.e., the survey and reports on the condition of the SME sector in Poland as well as statistical data analysis methods, i.e., structure index and the analysis of variance, using the SPSS system. The process of primary data collection was carried out by means of an electronic survey among selected enterprises of the SME sector, conducting business activities in Poland. In the study, the employment factor was taken into account as a determinant of the perception and assessment of the intensity of selected risks arising from the economic activity in the Polish market in the conditions of the current economic downturn. On the basis of the obtained results, the impact of market, economic, financial and operational risks, depending on their intensity, on the functioning of micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises was identified. Based on the analysis of variance, the effect of the size of the company on the level of individual risks was also examined. As a result of the observations made, it was established that, during the pandemic, the level and type of risk is similar in all the surveyed enterprises. They are most often threatened by strong competition in the industry, an increase in energy prices and insufficient profit.

Redirecting physical activity research in a post-COVID-19 world,17.644327,3.3585207,2021,"Rationale: A dysregulated host inflammatory response in COVID-19 is considered a central pathogenetic mechanism of acute lung injury and extrapulmonary end-organ damage. However, limited comparative data are available as to whether the host-response in COVID-19 ARDS differs from patients with other (non-COVID) ARDS etiologies, and how such differences may inform targeted immunomodulating therapeutics. Methods: We prospectively enrolled 36 intubated patients with COVID-19 ARDS and 70 hospitalized non-intubated patients with COVID-19 (COVID-19 non-ARDS), and compared them with a pre-COVID-19 cohort of patients with bacterial (n=21), viral (n=14), and culture-negative ARDS (n=30). We measured 10 host-response biomarkers of innate immunity and epithelial/endothelial injury (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, RAGE, TNFR1, Angiopoeitin-2, Procalcitonin, Fractalkine, Pentraxin-3, ST2) in plasma. Using a 4-variable predictive model (TNFR1, Angiopoeitin-2, Procalcitonin and bicarbonate levels), we classified patients into hyper-vs. hypo-inflammatory subphenotypes. We compared biomarker levels, subphenotypes and outcomes between the clinical groups. Results: Host-response biomarker levels were widely distributed between the 5 groups, with a characteristic pattern for IL-6, IL-8, Angiopoeitin-2, Procalcitonin, ST-2 and fractalkine: COVID-19 ARDS patients had higher biomarker levels than COVID-19 non-ARDS (p&lt;0.01), lower levels than bacterial or culture-negative ARDS (p&lt;0.01), and similar levels to viral ARDS (Figure 1A example for IL-6). A lower proportion of the COVID-19 ARDS cohort was classified in the adverse hyper-inflammatory subphenotype (15%) compared to bacterial (47%) and culture-negative ARDS (31%) (Figure 1B). Despite the lower level of inflammatory host responses, COVID-ARDS patients had longer median duration of mechanical ventilation (20.5 [10.0-40.8] days) compared to bacterial (8.0 [5.0-25.0]), culture-negative (7.0 [5.2-9.8]) and viral ARDS (7.5 [3.5-14.8]) (p&lt;0.01). Patients with COVID-19 but without ARDS had lower 30-day mortality (6%) compared to patients with ARDS from COVID-19 (31%) or other etiologies (bacterial 33%, culture-negative 40% and viral 21%). Conclusion: Development of ARDS from COVID-19 is characterized by intensified inflammation compared to hospitalized COVID-19 patients not requiring mechanical ventilation. Compared to ARDS from other etiologies, host-response inflammatory profiles in COVID-19 ARDS appear similar to other viral etiologies of ARDS, and are lower compared to bacterial or culture-negative ARDS. The etiology of worse clinical outcomes of COVID-19 ARDS despite the lower frequency of the prognostically adverse hyper-inflammatory subphenotype warrant urgent investigation.

Generally, total Ab bridging assays combine good sensitivity with high specificity. Therefore, we developed sensitive total Ab bridging assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 Abs to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein in addition to conventional isotype-specific assays. Ab kinetics was assessed in PCR-confirmed, hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients (n = 41) and three populations of patients with COVID-19 symptoms not requiring hospital admission: PCR-confirmed convalescent plasmapheresis donors (n = 182), PCR-confirmed hospital care workers (n = 47), and a group of longitudinally sampled symptomatic individuals highly suspect of COVID-19 (n = 14). In nonhospitalized patients, the Ab response to RBD is weaker but follows similar kinetics, as has been observed in hospitalized patients. Across populations, the RBD bridging assay identified most patients correctly as seropositive. In 11/14 of the COVID-19-suspect cases, seroconversion in the RBD bridging assay could be demonstrated before day 12; nucleocapsid protein Abs emerged less consistently. Furthermore, we demonstrated the feasibility of finger-prick sampling for Ab detection against SARS-CoV-2 using these assays. In conclusion, the developed bridging assays reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 Abs in hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients and are therefore well suited to conduct seroprevalence studies.","Vogelzang, Erik H; Loeff, Floris C; Derksen, Ninotska I L; Kruithof, Simone; Ooijevaar-de Heer, Pleuni; van Mierlo, Gerard; Linty, Federica; Mok, Juk Yee; van Esch, Wim; de Bruin, Sanne; Vlaar, Alexander P J; Seppen, Bart; Leeuw, Maureen; van Oudheusden, Anne J G; Buiting, Anton G M; Jim, Kin Ki; Vrielink, Hans; Swaneveld, Francis; Vidarsson, Gestur; van der Schoot, C Ellen; Wever, Peter C; Li, Wentao; van Kuppeveld, Frank; Murk, Jean-Luc; Bosch, Berend Jan; Wolbink, Gerrit-Jan; Rispens, Theo",J Immunol,461,16

This article reviews the neuroimaging manifestations of COVID-19 on CT and MRI, presenting cases from the New York City metropolitan region encountered by the authors during the first surge of the pandemic. The most common neuroimaging manifestations are acute infarcts with large clot burden and intracranial hemorrhage, including microhemorrhages. However, a wide range of additional imaging patterns occur, including leukoencephalopathy, global hypoxic injury, acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum, olfactory bulb involvement, cranial nerve enhancement, and Guillain Barré syndrome. The described central nervous system abnormalities largely represent secondary involvement from immune activation that leads to a prothrombotic state and cytokine storm; evidence for direct neuroinvasion is scant. Comorbidities such as hypertension, complications of prolonged illness and hospitalization, as well as associated supportive treatments, also contribute to the central nervous system involvement in COVID-19. Routine, long-term, neurologic follow-up may be warranted, given emerging evidence of long-term microstructural and functional changes on brain imaging, after COVID-19 recovery.","Moonis, Gul; Filippi, Christopher G; Kirsch, Claudia F E; Mohan, Suyash; Stein, Evan G; Hirsch, Joshua A; Mahajan, Amit",,461,24

Among them, genistein (Gen) stands out for showing cytotoxic activity against breast cancer cells. However, its low water solubility, limited bioavailability, and fast metabolism hinder its administration in chemopreventive therapies. To overcome these obstacles, bovine serum albumin nanovehicles (BSAnp) were obtained by a heat-induced self-assembly process at 70â¯°C and two aqueous medium pH (9.0 and 11.0) and assayed for the Gen loading. Thus, in this work, Gen loading in BSAnp was studied by spectroscopic techniques and compared with the one obtained for its stereoisomer, chrysin (Chrys). Results revealed that Gen binds to BSAnp via fluorescence quenching mechanism forming inclusion complexes. Compared to Chrys, Gen binding to BSAnp involved more molecules, whereas the association constant was similar for both flavonoids. In general, flavonoid loading in protein systems was strongly affected by the combined effects of BSA conformational state (native vs. aggregated), nanovehicle size, and flavonoid chemical structure. To evaluate the antitumor properties freeze-dried powders were obtained, and they were assayed in vitro after reconstitution by XTT technique and Annexin V-FITC flow cytometry against mouse mammary adenocarcinoma F3II cells. Gen-loaded BSAnp produced a significant decrease in cell viability compared with unloaded BSAnp systems, being the highest cytotoxic effects found for the lowest sized Gen-loaded BSAnp. The leading cytotoxicity mechanism for Gen-loaded systems was apoptosis. Summarizing, it can be concluded that BSAnp constitute versatile nanovehicles for potential flavonoid incorporation in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical matrices.","Ferrado, Joana B; Perez, Adrián A; Baravalle, María E; Renna, María Sol; Ortega, Hugo H; Santiago, Liliana G",Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,461,1

However, significant variations are observed in adherence to social distancing across individuals and countries. Due to the lack of treatment, rapid spread, and prevalence of COVID-19, panic and fear associated with the disease causes great stress. Subsequent effects will be a variation around the coping and mitigation strategies for different individuals following different paths to manage the situation. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore how threat and coping appraisal processes work as mechanisms between information and citizens' adherence to COVID-19-related recommendations (ie, how the information sources and social media influence threat and coping appraisal processes with COVID-19 and how the threat and coping appraisal processes influence adherence to policy guidelines). In addition, this study aims to explore how citizens in three different countries (the United States, Kuwait, and South Korea), randomly sampled, are effectively using the mechanisms. METHODS: Randomly sampled online survey data collected by a global firm in May 2020 from 162 citizens of the United States, 185 of Kuwait, and 71 of South Korea were analyzed, resulting in a total sample size of 418. A seemingly unrelated regression model, controlling for several counterfactuals, was used for analysis. The study's focal estimated effects were compared across the three countries using the weighted distance between the parameter estimates. RESULTS: The seemingly unrelated regression model estimation results suggested that, overall, the intensity of information source use for the COVID-19 pandemic positively influenced the threat appraisal for the disease (P<.001). Furthermore, the intensity of social media use for the COVID-19 pandemic positively influenced the coping appraisal for the disease (P<.001). Higher COVID-19 threat appraisal had a positive effect on social distancing adherence (P<.001). Higher COVID-19 coping appraisal had a positive effect on social distancing adherence (P<.001). Higher intensity of COVID-19 knowledge positively influenced social distancing adherence (P<.001). There were country-level variations. Broadly, we found that the United States had better results than South Korea and Kuwait in leveraging the information to threat and coping appraisal to the adherence process, indicating that individuals in countries like the United States and South Korea may be more pragmatic to appraise the situation before making any decisions. CONCLUSIONS: This study's findings suggest that the mediation of threat and coping strategies are essential, in varying effects, to shape the information and social media strategies for adherence outcomes. Accordingly, coordinating public service announcements along with information source outlets such as mainstream media (eg, TV and newspaper) as well as social media (eg, Facebook and Twitter) to inform citizens and, at the same time, deliver balanced messages about the threat and coping appraisal is critical in implementing a staggered social distancing and sheltering strategy.","Al-Hasan, Abrar; Khuntia, Jiban; Yim, Dobin",J Med Internet Res,461,16

A suitable parameter calibration that is based on the combined use of least squares method and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is proposed with the aim of reproducing the past history of the epidemic in Italy, surfaced in late February and still ongoing to date, and of validating SUIHTER in terms of its predicting capabilities. A distinctive feature of the new model is that it allows a one-to-one calibration strategy between the model compartments and the data that are daily made available from the Italian Civil Protection. The new model is then applied to the analysis of the Italian epidemic with emphasis on the second outbreak emerged in Fall 2020. In particular, we show that the epidemiological model SUIHTER can be suitably used in a predictive manner to perform scenario analysis at national level.","Parolini, Nicola; Dede', Luca; Antonietti, Paola F.; Ardenghi, Giovanni; Manzoni, Andrea; Miglio, Edie; Pugliese, Andrea; Verani, Marco; Quarteroni, Alfio",,461,1

In this paper, we present a method based on DeepConv-DilatedNet of identifying and localizing pneumonia in chest X-ray (CXR) images. Two-stage detector Faster R-CNN is adopted as the structure of a network. Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) is integrated into the residual neural network of a dilated bottleneck so that the deep features are expanded to preserve the deep feature and position information of the object. In the case of DeepConv-DilatedNet, the deconvolution network is used to restore high-level feature maps into its original size, and the target information is further retained. On the other hand, DeepConv-DilatedNet uses a popular fully convolution architecture with computation shared on the entire image. Then, Soft-NMS is used to screen boxes and ensure sample quality. Also, K-Means++ is used to generate anchor boxes to improve the localization accuracy. The algorithm obtained 39.23% Mean Average Precision (mAP) on the X-ray image dataset from the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) and got 38.02% Mean Average Precision (mAP) on the ChestX-ray14 dataset, surpassing other detection algorithms. So, in this paper, an improved algorithm that can provide doctors with location information of pneumonia lesions is proposed.","Yao, Shangjie; Chen, Yaowu; Tian, Xiang; Jiang, Rongxin",Comput Math Methods Med,461,1

In this review, we give an overview of the current literature regarding prevalence, diagnosis, and therapeutic options of recurrent CD. METHODS: We systematically screened the literature regarding recurrent and persistent Cushing's disease using the MESH term Cushing's disease and recurrence. Of 717 results in PubMed, all manuscripts in English and German published between 1980 and April 2020 were screened. Case reports, comments, publications focusing on pediatric CD or CD in veterinary disciplines or studies with very small sample size (patient number < 10) were excluded. Also, papers on CD in pregnancy were not included in this review. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Because of the high incidence of recurrence in CD, annual clinical and biochemical follow-up is paramount. 50% of recurrences occur during the first 50 months after first surgery. In case of recurrence, treatment options include second surgery, pituitary radiation, targeted medical therapy to control hypercortisolism, and bilateral adrenalectomy. Success rates of all these treatment options vary between 25 (some of the medical therapy) and 100% (bilateral adrenalectomy). All treatment options have specific advantages, limitations, and side effects. Therefore, treatment decisions have to be individualized according to the specific needs of the patient.","Braun, Leah T; Rubinstein, German; Zopp, Stephanie; Vogel, Frederick; Schmid-Tannwald, Christine; Escudero, Montserrat Pazos; Honegger, Jürgen; Ladurner, Roland; Reincke, Martin",Endocrine,461,16

We use a two step approach which is analogous to supervised training with ImageNet initialization, where we pretrain networks that are already pretrained on ImageNet dataset to improve downstream task performance on the domain of interest. To improve the speed of convergence and the overall performance, we propose weight scaling and filter selection methods prior to second step of pretraining. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on three popular contrastive techniques, namely SimCLR, SWaV and BYOL. Benefits of double pretraining include better performance, faster convergence, ability to train with smaller batch sizes and smaller image dimensions with negligible differences in performance. We hope our work helps democratize self-supervision by enabling researchers to fine-tune models without requiring large clusters or long training times.","Ciga, Ozan; Xu, Tony; Martel, Anne L.",,461,16

In the current review, we focused on the neurological complications associated with COVID-19. We discussed different pathways followed by RNA-virus, especially Flaviviridae family in the brain and passage through the Blood-Brain-Barrier BBB. Then, we explored SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms responsible of neuroinvasion and BBB disruption as well as the immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in the central nervous system CNS. Since SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, enclosed in a lipid bilayer and that lipids are essential cell components playing numerous biological roles in viral infection and replication, we investigated the lipid metabolism remodeling upon coronavirus replication. We also highlighted the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective potential of an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid DHA, as well as several bioactive lipid mediators. Altogether, our data allow better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion and could assist in drug targeting to decline the burden of short-term and long-term neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2.","Hachem, Mayssa",Biochimie,461,16

INTERVENTION: A team of nurses at the University of Ottawa and Ottawa Public Health and staff from the Ontario HIV Treatment Network (OHTN) obtained Health Canada's Special Access approval on April 23, 2020 to distribute bioLytical's INSTI HIV self-test in Ottawa; we received REB approval on May 15, 2020. As of July 20, 2020, eligible participants (&#8805;18 years old, HIV-negative, not on PrEP, not in an HIV vaccine trial, living in Ottawa, no bleeding disorders) could register via www.GetaKit.ca to order kits. OUTCOMES: In the first 6 weeks, 637 persons completed our eligibility screener; 43.3% (n = 276) were eligible. Of eligible participants, 203 completed a baseline survey and 182 ordered a test. These 203 participants were an average of 31 years old, 72.3% were white, 60.4% were cis-male, and 55% self-identified as gay. Seventy-one percent (n = 144) belonged to a priority group for HIV testing. We have results for 70.9% (n = 129/182) of participants who ordered a kit: none were positive, 104 were negative, 22 were invalid, and 2 ""preferred not to say""; 1 participant reported an unreadiness to test. IMPLICATIONS: Our results show that HIV self-testing is a pandemic-friendly strategy to help ensure access to sexual health services among persons who are good candidates for HIV testing. It is unsurprising that no one tested positive for HIV thus far, given the 0.08% positivity rate for HIV testing in Ottawa. As such, we advocate for scale-up of HIV self-testing in Canada.","O039,; Byrne, Patrick; Musten, Alexandra; Orser, Lauren; Inamdar, Gauri; Grayson, Marie-Odile; Jones, Clay; Francoeur, Megan; Lachance, Sarah; Paulin, Vickie",Can J Public Health,461,1

Compared to other risks affecting public health such as flooding, EDs attract little attention in terms of risk assessment in the current literature. It does not well respond to the high practical demand for advanced techniques capable of tackling ED risks. To bridge this gap, an adapted fuzzy evidence reasoning method is proposed to realize the quantitative analysis of ED outbreak risk assessment (EDRA) with high uncertainty in risk data. The novelty of this article lies in (1) taking the lead to establish the outbreak risk evaluation system of epidemics covering the whole epidemic developing process, (2) combining quantitative and qualitative analysis in the fields of epidemic risk evaluation, (3) collecting substantial first-hand data by reviewing transaction data and interviewing the frontier experts and policymakers from Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Chinese National Medical Products Administration. This work provides useful insights for the regulatory bodies to (1) understand the risk levels of different EDs in a quantitative manner and (2) the sensitivity of different EDs to the identified risk factors for their effective control. For instance, in the case study, we use real data to disclose that influenza has the highest breakout risk level in Beijing. The proposed method also provides a potential tool for evaluating the outbreak risk of COVID-19.","Shi, Xianliang; Li, Jiangning; Huang, Anqiang; Song, Shaohua; Yang, Zaili",Risk anal,461,1

METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 63 individuals attending a clozapine clinic within the Galway-Roscommon Mental Health Services to determine the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on anxiety and depressive symptoms, social and occupational functioning and quality of life, utilising Likert Scale data. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) were additionally utilised to measure anxiety symptoms cross-sectionally. RESULTS: Anxiety symptoms were low with a median Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) score of 4.0 and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) score of 4.0. Likert scale measurements recorded only a modest adverse impact of COVID-19 restrictions on anxiety and depressive symptoms, quality of life and occupational and social functioning. Free-text comments from patients (n=55), were grouped into five themes (neutral impact (n=22), negative psychological impact (n=13), negative social impact (n=11), positive psychological impact (n=5), and media coverage inducing anxiety (n=4)). CONCLUSIONS: Three months into the COVID-19 pandemic and its restrictions, the impact on individuals with treatment resistant psychotic disorders attending a clozapine clinic has been modest, with preliminary evidence demonstrating minimal increases in subjective symptoms of anxiety and reduced social functioning.

However, severe adverse effects have been reported for some of these repurposed drugs. Recently, several in silico studies have identified compounds that are potential inhibitors of the main protease (3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease) and the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2. An essential step of drug development is the careful evaluation of toxicity, which has a range of associated financial, temporal and ethical limitations. In this study, a number of in silico tools were used to predict the toxicity of 19 experimental compounds. A range of web-based servers and applications were used to predict hepatotoxicity, mutagenicity, acute oral toxicity, carcinogenicity, cardiotoxicity, and other potential adverse effects. The compounds were assessed based on the consensus of results, and were labelled as positive or negative for a particular toxicity endpoint. The compounds were then categorised into three classes, according to their predicted toxicity. Ten compounds (52.6%) were predicted to be non-mutagenic and non-hERG inhibitors, and exhibited zero or low level hepatotoxicity and carcinogenicity. Furthermore, from the consensus of results, all 19 compounds were predicted to be non-mutagenic and negative for acute oral toxicity. Overall, most of the compounds displayed encouraging toxicity profiles.

A mechanistic study showed that hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;) was directly recruited to the Wnt3a promoter. Wnt3a overexpression significantly decreased cell viability, promoted the generation of apoptotic cells, and enhanced hypoxia-induced injury in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. This was partially through the upregulation of Caspase-3 mRNA levels and cleaved PARP-1 protein levels. In addition, we observed that Wnt3a exacerbated hypoxia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cytosolic release of cytochrome C. Furthermore, we found that Sirt3, a mitochondrial NAD+-dependent deacetylase that modulates mitochondrial metabolism and homeostasis, was negatively regulated by Wnt3a. Conversely, Sirt3 overexpression repressed Wnt3a expression and ameliorated the hypoxia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.

Mass testing was found not to have impact on the number of hospitalizations during the pandemic. Furthermore, during the highest level of testing in the spring 2021 the fraction of positive tests increased slightly on comparable days indicating that mass testing at best, did not reduce the prevalence of Covid-19. The relationship between positives in antigen testing and in PCR testing indicated that many patients are not tested early in their infection where the risk of transmission is highest. A likely explanation for the lack of impact of mass testing on hospitalizations and infections is that the testing increases risk-behaviour of the tested persons and that a high fraction of false negatives at low Covid-19 prevalence combined with increased risk-behaviour outweighs beneficial effects of mass testing.","Busk, Peter Kamp; Kristiansen, Thomas Birk; Engsig-Karup, Allan",,461,16

To address these limitations, we propose CrossPath: a brain tumor grading tool that supports top-down, cross data type, multi-criterion histological analysis, where pathologists can shepherd mixed AI models. CrossPath first uses AI to discover multiple histological criteria with H and E and Ki-67 slides based on WHO guidelines. Second, CrossPath demonstrates AI findings with multi-level explainable supportive evidence. Finally, CrossPath provides a top-down shepherding workflow to help pathologists derive an evidence-based, precise grading result.

After the announcement of lockdown in Italy on 9 March 2020, situation was becoming stable since last days of March. In view of this, it is important to forecast the COVID-19 evaluation of Italy condition and the possible effects, if this lock down could continue for another 60 days. METHODS: COVID-19 infected patient data has extracted from the Italian Health Ministry website includes registered and recovered cases from mid February to end March. Adoption of seasonal ARIMA forecasting package with R statistical model was done. RESULTS: Predictions were done with 93.75% of accuracy for registered case models and 84.4% of accuracy for recovered case models. The forecasting of infected patients could be reach the value of 182,757, and recovered cases could be registered value of 81,635 at end of May. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of country lockdown and self isolation in control the disease transmissibility among Italian population through data driven model analysis. Our findings suggest that nearly 35% decrement of registered cases and 66% growth of recovered cases will be possible.","Chintalapudi, Nalini; Battineni, Gopi; Amenta, Francesco",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,461,1

Therapy for symptoms must remain flexible and individualized because the specific needs of the patient will change as disease progresses. Because strangulation is uncommon, malignant bowel obstruction is usually not a surgical emergency. There is usually time to proceed with deliberate and thoughtful decisions on how best to meet the needs and expectations of the individual patient and family. Providers must be well versed in both surgical and nonsurgical therapeutic options, the natural history of disease, and be active and compassionate providers to foster meaningful ongoing dialogue focused on excellent care even after cure is no longer possible. The palliative triangle not only allows patient, family, and surgeon to effectively utilize the full continuum of care that can be delivered, but also it supports end-of-life decisions when continuity in care matters most. Due to social distancing requirements, the dynamics of communication between patient, family, and surgeon have changed.

Methods: We collected data provided by users of the mobile app ""Anesthesiologist"" during 1 October 2018-30 June 2020. We analysed these using RStudio and generated 7-day moving-average app use plots. We calculated country-level reductions in app use as a percentage of baseline. We obtained data on COVID-19 case counts from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. We plotted changing app use and COVID-19 case counts for several countries and regions. Findings: A total of 100 099 app users within 214 countries and territories provided data. We observed that app use was reduced during holidays, weekends and at night, correlating with expected fluctuations in surgical volume. We observed that the onset of the pandemic prompted substantial reductions in app use. We noted strong cross-correlation between COVID-19 case count and reductions in app use in low- and middle-income countries, but not in high-income countries. Of the 112 countries and territories with non-zero app use during baseline and during the pandemic, we calculated a median reduction in app use to 73.6% of baseline.

This report describes a case of cholestatic liver injury induced by favipiravir. A 73-year-old Japanese with a history of alcoholic hepatitis was infected with SARS-CoV2. Drug therapy was instituted with lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon ß-1b. However, his condition worsened despite additional support with continuous hemodiafiltration and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We suspected complications of bacterial pneumonia and started favipiravir in addition to antimicrobial therapy. Favipiravir was administered at 6000 mg/day on the first day and 2400 mg/day for the second and subsequent days for 14 days. After the initiation of antibiotics, transaminase and total bilirubin were elevated, suggesting a transient cholestasic liver dysfunction. The liver dysfunction in this case may have been triggered by antibacterial treatment, and high dose of favipiravir may have promoted the deterioration of liver function. Monitoring of liver function is vital and close attention should be paid when using favipiravir at high doses or in patients with impaired liver function.","Yamazaki, Shingo; Suzuki, Takaaki; Sayama, Misa; Nakada, Taka-Aki; Igari, Hidetoshi; Ishii, Itsuko",J Infect Chemother,461,16

Findings suggest that many of the tweets employing #BoomerRemover were grounded in either personal or political ageism. In addition, a significant portion of tweeters used #BoomerRemover to defend older adults and speak out against ageism. This study highlights the importance of recognizing and addressing the growing intergenerational divide on social media, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Skipper, Antonius D; Rose, Daniel J",J Aging Stud,461,33

We aim to review the various aspects of patient-centered care via diabetes self-management education based on available literature. METHODS: This is a narrative review using Pubmed, EMBASE and Google Scholar search till March 29, 2020. Search terms were ""COVID-19"", ""diabetes self-care"", ""diabetes self-management education"", ""DSME"", ""diabetes self-management in India"", ""diabetes self-care in India"" and ""DSME in India"". RESULTS: We have discussed an educational plan on diabetes self-management that can be adopted for people with diabetes mellitus in our country amid the ongoing pandemic. We have also identified the barriers to diabetes self-management in the current scenario and suggested possible solutions to overcome those. CONCLUSIONS: We have reemphasized the need for a simultaneous patient-centered approach in routine diabetes care that has to be coordinated by a multidisciplinary team amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Banerjee, Mainak; Chakraborty, Soumen; Pal, Rimesh",Diabetes Metab Syndr,461,16

MAIN METHODS: The novel ventilator consists of an inspiratory limb composed of an elastic flow-inflating bag encased within a non-compliant outer sheath and an expiratory limb composed of a series of two, one-way bidirectional splitter valves derived from a self-inflating bag system. An Arduino Uno microcontroller controls a solenoid valve that can be programmed to open and close to produce a set respiratory rate and inspiratory time. Using an ASL 5000 Lung Simulator, we obtained flow, pressure, and volume waveforms at different lung compliances. KEY FINDINGS: At a static lung compliance of 50 mL/cm H2O and an airway resistance of 6 cm H2O/L/s, ventilated at a PIP and PEEP of 16 and 5 cm H2O, respectively, tidal volumes of approximately 540 mL were achieved. At a static lung compliance of 20 mL/cm H2O and an airway resistance of 6 cm H2O/L/s, ventilated at a PIP and PEEP of 38 and 15 cm H2O, respectively, tidal volumes of approximately 495 mL were achieved. SIGNIFICANCE: This novel ventilator is able to safely and reliably ventilate patients with a range of pulmonary disease in a simulated setting.

This article uses China UnionPay transaction data and takes Hubei, the worst-hit region by COVID-19 in China, as an example, to conduct empirical analysis using the generalized method of moments (GMM) of the impact of current urbanization patterns on the spread of the epidemic and economic recovery from the perspectives of time, industry, and regional differences. The study found that during the different stages of COVID-19, including discovery, outbreak, and subsidence, the overall impact of urbanization on the economy in Hubei Province was first positive, then became negative, and finally gradually increased. This process had significant industrial and urban heterogeneity, which was mainly manifested in losses in tourism and catering industries that were significantly greater than those in the audio-visual entertainment and digital office industries. Similarly, the recovery speed of large cities was lower than that of small and medium-sized cities. The main reason for these differences is that the one-sided problem of urbanization is more obvious in areas with higher urbanization rates. COVID-19 has drawn attention to the development of urbanization in the future, that is, the development path of one-sided economic resource agglomeration and scale expansion should be abandoned, with greater attention paid to the improvement of service functions and the development of amenities. This transformation is necessary to enhance urban economic resilience and reduce public health risks.","Yang, Wenyi; Wang, Xueli; Zhang, Keke; Ke, Zikan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),461,16

However, multiple recent findings have verified its importance in blocking virus spread. Evidence on the association between mobility, cases imported from abroad and local medical resource supplies is limited. To reveal the association, this study quantified the importance of inter- and intra-country mobility in containing virus spread and avoiding hospitalizations during early stages of COVID-19 outbreaks in India, Japan, and China. We calculated the time-varying reproductive number (Rt) and duration from illness onset to diagnosis confirmation (Doc), to represent conditions of virus spread and hospital bed shortages, respectively. Results showed that inter-country mobility fluctuation could explain 80%, 35%, and 12% of the variance in imported cases and could prevent 20 million, 5 million, and 40 million imported cases in India, Japan and China, respectively. The critical time for screening and monitoring of imported cases is 2 weeks at minimum and 4 weeks at maximum, according to the time when the Pearson's Rs between Rt and imported cases reaches a peak (>0.8). We also found that if local transmission is initiated, a 1% increase in intra-country mobility would result in 1430 (±501), 109 (±181), and 10 (±1) additional bed shortages, as estimated using the Doc in India, Japan, and China, respectively.

While most randomized controlled trials have shown negative results, uncontrolled studies have suggested that the antibody content may influence patient outcomes. We conducted an open-label, randomized controlled trial of convalescent plasma for adults with COVID-19 receiving oxygen within 12 days of respiratory symptom onset. Patients were allocated 2:1 to 500 mL of convalescent plasma or standard of care. The composite primary outcome was intubation or death by 30 days. The effect of convalescent plasma antibodies on the primary outcome was assessed by logistic regression. The trial was terminated at 78% of planned enrollment after meeting stopping criteria for futility. 940 patients were randomized and 921 patients were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. Intubation or death occurred in 199/614 (32.4%) in the convalescent plasma arm and 86/307 (28.0%) in the standard of care arm; relative risk (RR) 1.16 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-1.43; p=0.18). Patients in the convalescent plasma arm had more serious adverse events (33.4% vs. 26.4%; RR=1.27, 95% CI 1.02-1.57, p=0.034). The antibody content significantly modulated the therapeutic effect of convalescent plasma. In multivariate analysis, each standard log increase in neutralization or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity independently reduced the potential harmful effect of plasma (OR=0.74; 0.57-0.95 and OR=0.66; 0.50-0.87, respectively), while IgG against the full transmembrane Spike protein increased it (OR=1.53, 95% CI 1.14-2.05). Convalescent plasma did not reduce the risk of intubation or death at 30 days among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Transfusion of convalescent plasma with unfavourable antibody profiles may be associated with worse clinical outcomes compared to standard care.

But pathogens cannot been seen as unique entities; their intraspecific genetic variability represented in variants, strains, antigenic types or genetic lineages may cause different impacts at the population level (Nelson and Holmes, 2007; Greenspan et al., 2018). The global spread of pathogens has been largely facilitated by globalization of transport, which particularly intensified during the last century (O'Hanlon et al., 2018). As seen with SARS-CoV-2, air travel can rapidly spread a pathogen globally (Wells et al., 2020). Furthermore, after initial introduction subsequent translocations of a pathogen may cause the contact of different variants facilitating the rise of novel genotypes that may have higher pathogenicity or transmissibility (Nelson and Holmes, 2007; Greenspan et al., 2018). Chytridiomycosis is an EID caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), that infects amphibian skin causing population declines to extinction in susceptible species. Now a wildlife pandemic, Bd has been recognized as the single pathogen causing the greatest loss of biodiversity on Earth (Scheele et al., 2019). Recent advances in genetics have made novel tools for pathogen detection and characterization more accessible and reliable (Boyle et al., 2004; Byrne et al., 2019).

The transition towards a sustainable forest bio-based economy is associated with resource efficiency optimization, adoption of innovative bio-based approaches in terms of technological improvements and cost effectiveness, and an opportunity to reach multiple societal challenges. This paper is focused on a comparative analysis of the forestry sector in the Republic of Bulgaria and the Slovak Republic by estimating the economic efficiency of four Bulgarian state-owned forest enterprises and four Slovak forest enterprises. The evaluation of economic efficiency was carried out using selected indicators of the studied enterprises over a period of five years. A data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach was used as a non-parametric linear technique for measuring the relative efficiency of a set of production decision-making units (DMUs). The Malmquist productivity index (MPI) was used to assess the pure efficiency changes (PEC) and technological changes (TCs) of the studied forest enterprises. Data for 2014–2018 were processed. The results obtained for the economic efficiency study outlined the major factors affecting the differences in efficiency scores. The long-term sustainability and increased economic efficiency of forest enterprises in both countries can be achieved by improvements in forest management and investments in research and development activities.","Neykov, Nikolay Krišťáková Stanislava Hajdúchová Iveta Sedliačiková Mariana Antov Petar Giertliová Blanka",Forests,461,26

Understanding how hospitals can continue providing services in an effective manner under these circumstances is thus important. In this study, we investigate how information technology (IT) helped hospitals in mainland China better respond to the outbreak of the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a content analysis of pages published on the websites of the top 50 hospitals in mainland China between January 22 and February 21, 2020. In total, we analyzed 368 pages that the hospitals published during the initial days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose was to identify common themes related to the utilization of IT by these hospitals in response to the pandemic's outbreak. RESULTS: We identified 5 focal themes across the webpages published by the hospitals during our study period, including (1) popular medical science education, (2) digitalized hospital processes, (3) knowledge management for medical professionals, (4) telemedicine, and (5) new IT initiatives for healthcare services. Our analysis revealed that Chinese hospitals spent greater effort in promoting popular medical science education in the initial stages of our study period and more on telemedicine in the latter stages. DISCUSSION: We propose a configurational approach for hospitals to design response strategies to pandemic outbreaks based on their available resources. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides rich insights for hospitals to better utilize their IT resources and some recommendations for policymaker to better support hospitals in the future.","Yan, Aihua; Zou, Yi; Mirchandani, Dinesh A",J Am Med Inform Assoc,461,12

These stereo-specific phosphorothioates are made with a newly developed synthesis method and are being analyzed both theoretically and experimentally. Their structures are obtained theoretically by using many-body Schrödinger equations applied to a group of 11 stereo-defined LNA antisense oligonucleotides selected for biological experiments. The fully converged electronic structures were obtained from ab initio quantum calculations providing the specific electronic structures. One important result was the observation that the calculated electronic structure, represented by the iso-surface area of the electron density in Å2, correlated linearly with LNA oligonucleotide uptake in the liver and kidney. This study also shows that more complex biological phenomena, such as drug activity, will require more molecular and cellular identifiers than used here before a correlation can be found. Establishing biological correlations between quantum mechanical (QM) calculated structures and antisense oligonucleotides is novel, and this method may constitute new tools in drug discovery.","Hansen, Henrik Frydenlund; Albaek, Nanna; Hansen, Bo Rode; Shim, Irene; Bohr, Henrik; Koch, Troels",Sci Rep,461,20

Despite the promise of COVID-19 vaccines, the community is highly distrustful of the vaccine and institutions given a history of mistreatment and many other current concerns. Trusted messengers such as Black pastors are crucial to protecting the community that faces a disproportionate amount of disease. We present a framework to build trust and acceptance including understanding history and context; listening and empathy; engaging pastors as trusted messengers; creating partnerships with shared responsibility and power; and co-creation of solutions with faith leaders and their community, governments and institutions to create sustainable, long-term change. Efforts to support vaccine acceptance must be customized to the variety of needs and realities of the African American community, not just the topic of concern to the institution. Evaluations are needed to help ensure the community is engaged and feeling heard. Pastors and other religious leaders can work with government and institutions to bring information, facilitate discussion, build trust and develop measurable improvement efforts.

However, the high variability in cellphone image data acquisition and the common need for large amounts of specialist-annotated images for traditional DL model training may preclude generalizability of smartphone-based diagnostics. Here, we employed adversarial neural networks with conditioning to develop an easily reconfigurable virus diagnostic platform that leverages a dataset of smartphone-taken microfluidic chip photos to rapidly generate image classifiers for different target pathogens on-demand. Adversarial learning was also used to augment this real image dataset by generating 16,000 realistic synthetic microchip images, through style generative adversarial networks (StyleGAN). We used this platform, termed smartphone-based pathogen detection resource multiplier using adversarial networks (SPyDERMAN), to accurately detect different intact viruses in clinical samples and to detect viral nucleic acids through integration with CRISPR diagnostics. We evaluated the performance of the system in detecting five different virus targets using 179 patient samples. The generalizability of the system was confirmed by rapid reconfiguration to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigens in nasal swab samples (n = 62) with 100% accuracy. Overall, the SPyDERMAN system may contribute to epidemic preparedness strategies by providing a platform for smartphone-based diagnostics that can be adapted to a given emerging viral agent within days of work.","Shokr, Ahmed; Pacheco, Luis G C; Thirumalaraju, Prudhvi; Kanakasabapathy, Manoj Kumar; Gandhi, Jahnavi; Kartik, Deeksha; Silva, Filipe S R; Erdogmus, Eda; Kandula, Hemanth; Luo, Shenglin; Yu, Xu G; Chung, Raymond T; Li, Jonathan Z; Kuritzkes, Daniel R; Shafiee, Hadi",ACS nano,461,20

In order to confirm our results, we supplemented our analysis with a study of the introduction of coronavirus-related university webpages. We find that universities with large numbers of students are more likely to use social media and the web to speak about the pandemic sooner than institutions with fewer students. Universities with large financial resources are also more likely to tweet sooner, but they do not introduce Covid-19 webpages faster than other universities. We also find evidence of a strong process of emulation, whereby universities are more likely to post a coronavirus-related tweet or webpage if other universities have already done so.","Flores, A.

Further monitoring of the disease prognosis and effective control of the ""relapse"" of the epidemic has become the next focus of work. This study analysed the clinical prognosis of discharged COVID-19 patients by monitoring their SAR-CoV-2 nucleic acid status, which provided a theoretical basis for medical institutions to formulate discharge standards and follow-up management for COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We included 13 discharged COVID-19 patients who were quarantined for 4 weeks at home. The patient's daily clinical signs were recorded and sputum and faecal specimens were regularly sent for detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. RESULTS: The time between initial symptoms and meeting discharge criteria was 18 to 44 days with an average of 25 ± 6 days. The faecal samples of two patients still tested positive after meeting the discharge criteria and the sputum samples of four patients returned positive 5 to 14 days after discharge. The rate of the recurring positive test result in samples from the respiratory system was 31% (4/13). CONCLUSION: Under the present discharge criteria, the high presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in faecal and respiratory samples of discharged COVID-19 patients indicates potential infectivity. Therefore, we suggest that faecal virus nucleic acid should be tested as a routine monitoring index for COVID-19 and a negative result be added to the criteria. Simultaneously, we should strengthen the regular follow-up of discharged patients with continuous monitoring of the recurrence of viral nucleic acid.","Li, Youjiang; Hu, Yingying; Yu, Yuanyuan; Zhang, Xiaodong; Li, Bin; Wu, Jianguo; Li, Junyu; Wu, Yingping; Xia, Xiaoping; Tang, Huina; Xu, Jian",J Med Virol,461,16

We aimed to assess the association of NIV versus MV with mortality and morbidity during respiratory intervention among hypoxemic patients admitted with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective multi-center cohort study across 5 hospitals during March-April 2020. Outcomes included mortality, severe COVID-19-related symptoms, time to discharge, and final oxygen saturation (SpO2) at the conclusion of the respiratory intervention. Multivariable regression of outcomes was conducted in all hypoxemic participants, 4 subgroups, and propensity-matched analysis. RESULTS: Of 2381 participants with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, 688 were included in the study who were hypoxemic upon initiation of respiratory intervention. During the study period, 299 participants died (43%), 163 were admitted to the ICU (24%), and 121 experienced severe COVID-19-related symptoms (18%). Participants on MV had increased mortality than those on NIV (128/154 [83%] versus 171/534 [32%], OR = 30, 95% CI 16-60) with a mean survival of 6 versus 15 days, respectively. The MV group experienced more severe COVID-19-related symptoms [55/154 (36%) versus 66/534 (12%), OR = 4.3, 95% CI 2.7-6.8], longer time to discharge (mean 17 versus 7.1 days), and lower final SpO2 (92 versus 94%). Across all subgroups and propensity-matched analysis, MV was associated with a greater OR of death than NIV. CONCLUSIONS: NIV was associated with lower respiratory intervention mortality and morbidity than MV. However, findings may be liable to unmeasured confounding and further study from randomized controlled trials is needed to definitively determine the role of NIV in hypoxemic patients with COVID-19.","Forrest, Iain S; Jaladanki, Suraj K; Paranjpe, Ishan; Glicksberg, Benjamin S; Nadkarni, Girish N; Do, Ron",Infection,461,16

Positive wastewater samples triggered clinical testing of almost all residents within that dorm; thus, SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals were identified regardless of symptom expression. This current study examined clinical testing data to determine the abundance of asymptomatic versus symptomatic cases in these defined communities. Nasal and nasopharyngeal swab samples processed via antigen and PCR tests indicated that 79.2% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were asymptomatic, and only 20.8% of positive cases reported COVID-19 symptoms at the time of testing. Clinical data was paired with corresponding wastewater virus concentrations, which enabled calculation of viral shedding rates in feces per infected person(s). Mean shedding rates averaged from positive wastewater samples across all dorms were 6.84 {+/-} 0.77 log10 genome copies per gram of feces (gc/g-feces) based on the N1 gene and 7.74 {+/-} 0.53 log10 gc/g-feces based on the N2 gene.

An 8-year-old girl who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) presented with fever, abdominal pain, and shock with ultrasound findings consistent with acute appendicitis. After being treated for MIS-C, she underwent appendectomy and improved. Final pathology was consistent with acute appendicitis. A 9-year-old girl who tested negative for COVID RT-PCR presented with uncomplicated appendicitis and underwent laparoscopic appendectomy, but developed post-operative fever and shock. Antibody testing was positive and she responded to treatment for MIS-C. Histology showed lymphohistiocytic inflammation within the muscularis propria, mesoappendix and serosa without the typical neutrophil-rich inflammation and mucosal involvement of acute appendicitis. The diagnosis was MIS-C, not appendicitis.

In this study, we investigate the potential of high-dose intravenous vitamin C (HDIVC) in the prevention of moderate COVID-19 disease aggravation. Methods: In this retrospective before-after case-matched clinical study, we compare the outcome and clinical courses of patients with moderate COVID-19 patients who were treated with an HDIVC protocol (intravenous injection of vitamin C, 100 mg/kg/day, 1 g/h, for 7 days from admission) during a one-month period (between March 18 and april 18, 2020, HDIVC group) with a control group treated without the HDIVC protocol during the preceding two months (January 18 to March 18, 2020). Patients in the two groups were matched in a 1:1 ratio according to age and gender. Results: The HDIVC and control groups each comprised 55 patients. For the primary outcomes, there was a significant difference in the number of patients that evolved from moderate to severe type between the two groups (HDIVC: 4/55 vs. control: 12/55, relative risk [RR] = 0.28 [0.08, 0.93], P = 0.03). Compared to the control group, there was a shorter duration of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (P = 0.0004) during the first week and lower SIRS occurrence (2/21 vs 10/22, P = 0.0086) on Day 7 (6–7 days after admission). In addition, HDIVC group had lower C-reactive protein levels (P = 0.005) and higher number of CD4(+) T cells from Day 0 (on admission) to Day 7 (P = 0.04).” The levels of coagulation indicators, including activated partial thromboplastin time and D-dimer were also improved in the HDIVC compared to the control group on Day 7. Conclusion: HDIVC may be beneficial in limiting disease aggravation in the early stage of COVID-19 pneumonia, which may be related to its improvements on the inflammatory response, immune function and coagulation function. Further randomized controlled trials are required to augment these findings.","Zhao, Bing; Liu, Min; Liu, Ping; Peng, Yibing; Huang, Jun; Li, Mengjiao; Wang, Yihui; Xu, LiLi; Sun, Silei; Qi, Xing; Ling, Yun; Li, Jian; Zhang, Wenhong; Mao, Enqiang; Qu, Jieming",Front Pharmacol,461,16

RESULTS: 54% (n = 152) reported never attending a training session on (Infection Prevention & Control) IPC prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. The perception regarding IPC were found to be good among radiologists as majority of the respondents were correctly able to answer questions regarding IPC. 86% (n = 152) of the respondents believed that their knowledge on IPC has improved during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it was revealed that majority of the respondents only started to practice appropriate contact and droplet / procedural precautions only after the COVID-19 outbreak.

Hospitalization and disease severity were associated with predominant IFNg and IL-4 responses, as well as increased responses against S peptides and apoptosis, while non-hospitalized patients were characterized by IL-10 secretion, to which a particular subset expressing high levels of CCR7 contributed abundantly. Importantly, lung-resident memory T cells were strongly detected in convalescent patients, in which contemporary blood did not reflect tissue resident profiles. Our results suggest that a balanced anti-inflammatory antiviral response promoted by non-spike proteins may be key to favor infection resolution without major complications.

METHODS: A multilevel framework informed interview guide development. Using purposeful sampling, we recruited study participants who were (1) able to speak English or Spanish and (2) resided or employed in Washington Heights or the South Bronx. Participants included community leaders (local government officials, community board members, and employees from community- and faith-based organizations) as well as community members. Trained research staff conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews. Using immersion/crystallization and template style coding, the study team performed thematic analysis until no new relevant themes emerged. RESULTS: Among the 19 female study participants, perceived facilitators to SSB policy and program implementation included sustained partnerships with broad coalitions; continual education and clear messaging; and increased accessibility to healthier beverages. Perceived barriers included systems-level challenges accessing programs that support healthy beverage options, and individual-level lack of access to affordable healthy beverages. Acceptable potential intervention strategies included messaging that emphasizes health in pregnancy and infancy; policies that require healthy beverages as the default option in restaurants; and policies that remove SSBs from childcare settings. Some strongly favored SSB excise taxes while others opposed them, but all participants supported reinvestment of SSB tax revenue into health resources among marginalized communities. CONCLUSIONS: A multi-pronged approach that incorporates engagement, access, equitable reinvestment of revenue, and continual clear messaging may facilitate implementation of policies and programs to reduce SSB consumption in the first 1000 days.","Braid, Lucy; Oliva, Rocio; Nichols, Kelsey; Reyes, Anita; Guzman, Jairo; Goldman, Roberta E.; Woo Baidal, Jennifer A.",Matern Child Health J,461,24

RESULTS: In comparison with White ethnic groups, the risk of short-duration Covid-19 sickness absence was modestly elevated in South Asian but not Black groups. However, all Black and ethnic minority groups were at higher risk of prolonged Covid-19 sickness absence. Odds ratios (ORs) relative to White ethnicity were more than doubled in South Asian groups (Indian OR 2.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.36–2.63; Pakistani OR 2.38, 2.15–2.64; Bangladeshi OR 2.38, 1.98–2.86), while that for Black African ethnicity was 1.82 (1.71–1.93).

As a consequence, an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA has allowed importation of N95-type masks manufactured to international standards; these include KN95 masks from China and FFP2 masks from the European Union. METHODS: We conducted a survey of mask in the inventory of major academic medical centers in Boston, MA to determine provenance and manufacturer. We then assembled a simple apparatus for performing a necessary (but not sufficient) test of filtration performance and tested masks from the inventory; an accompanying website shows how to build and use the testing apparatus. RESULTS: Our survey showed that, seven months after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, over 100 different makes and models of N95-type masks are in the inventory of local hospitals as opposed to 2–5 models under normal circumstances. A substantial number of unfamiliar masks are from unknown manufacturers. Many did not perform to accepted standards and are likely to be counterfeit. Due to the absence of publicly available information on mask suppliers in the FDA EUA and confusing or inconsistent labeling of KN95 masks, it is difficult to distinguish legitimate and counterfeit products. CONCLUSIONS: Many of the FFR masks available for procurement during the COVID-19 pandemic do not provide levels of fit and filtration similar to those of N95 masks and are not acceptable for use in healthcare settings. Based on these results, and in consultation with occupational health officers, we make six recommendations for end users to assist in acquiring legitimate products. In particular, institutions should always assess masks from non-traditional supply chains by checking their markings and manufacturer information against data provided by NIOSH and the latest FDA EUA Appendix A. In the absence of verifiable information on the legitimacy of mask source, institutions should consider measuring mask fit and filtration directly. We also make suggestions for U.S and Chinese regulatory agencies with regard to labeling and public disclosure aimed at increase pandemic resilience.","Plana, Deborah; Tian, Enze; Cramer, Avilash K.; Yang, Helen; Carmack, Mary M.; Sinha, Michael S.; Bourgeois, Florence T.; Yu, Sherry H.; Masse, Peter; Boyer, Jon; Kim, Minjune; Mo, Jinhan; LeBoeuf, Nicole R.; Li, Ju; Sorger, Peter K.",medRxiv,461,24

Although global and national AMR action plans are in place, infection prevention and control is primarily discussed in the context of healthcare facilities with home and everyday life settings barely addressed. As seen with the recent global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, everyday hygiene measures can play an important role in containing the threat from infectious microorganisms. This position paper has been developed following a meeting of global experts in London, 2019. It presents evidence that home and community settings are important for infection transmission and also the acquisition and spread of AMR. It also demonstrates that the targeted hygiene approach offers a framework for maximizing protection against colonization and infections, thereby reducing antibiotic prescribing and minimizing selection pressure for the development of antibiotic resistance. If combined with the provision of clean water and sanitation, targeted hygiene can reduce the circulation of resistant bacteria in homes and communities, regardless of a country's Human Development Index (overall social and economic development). Achieving a reduction of AMR strains in healthcare settings requires a mirrored reduction in the community. The authors call upon national and international policy makers, health agencies and healthcare professionals to further recognize the importance of targeted hygiene in the home and everyday life settings for preventing and controlling infection, in a unified quest to tackle AMR.","Maillard, Jean-Yves; Bloomfield, Sally F.; Courvalin, Patrice; Essack, Sabiha Y.; Gandra, Sumanth; Gerba, Charles P.; Rubino, Joseph R.; Scott, Elizabeth A.",Am J Infect Control,461,33

In response both to low uptake of testing across all camps, and rumours of an outbreak of an influenza-like illness in May/June 2020, the International Organization for Migration (in partnership with ACAPS) undertook a qualitative study to collect accounts from the Rohingya relating to testing and treatment, and to explore the possibility that what was thought to be an outbreak of influenza may have been COVID-19. The report provided rich descriptions of the apprehension around testing and offered some clear recommendations for addressing these. We developed a testing ‘script’ in response to these recommendations, deploying it alongside a survey to determine reasons for declining a test. We compared testing uptake before deploying the testing script, and after (controlling for the total number of consultations), to generate a crude measure of the impact of the script on testing uptake. We coded reasons for declining a test thematically, disaggregated by status (Rohingya and host community) and sex. Despite the small sample size our results suggest an increase in testing uptake following the implementation of the script. Reasons provided by patients for declining a test included: 1) fear, 2) the belief that COVID-19 does not exist, that Allah will prevent them from contracting it, or that their symptoms are not caused by COVID-19, 3) no permission from husband/family, and 4) a preference to return at a later time for a test. Our findings largely mirror the qualitative accounts in the International Organization for Migration/ACAPS report and suggest that further testing amongst both populations will be complicated by fear, and a lack of clarity around testing. Our data lend force to the recommendations in the International Organization for Migration/ACAPS report and emphasise that contextual factors play a key role and must be considered in designing and implementing a health response to a novel disease.","McGowan, Catherine R.; Hellman, Nora; Chowdhury, Sayem; Mannan, Abdul; Newell, Katherine; Cummings, Rachael",Confl Health,461,16

To place recent findings into context, we compared symptoms and functional health status in two independent samples assessed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Participants were recruited via an online panel using quota sampling. We assessed symptoms, functional health, and global quality of life with the EORTC QLQ-C30 in two general population samples in Spain (collected in July 2019 and April 2020). We also assessed several COVID-19 related variables, such as adherence to social distancing. RESULTS: Data from N = 1010 participants before the pandemic (mean age 47.1 years, 50.5% female) were compared with data from N = 504 participants during the pandemic (mean age 47.1 years, 50.8% female). Participants during the pandemic (vs. before the pandemic) reported lower role functioning and emotional functioning, as well as less symptom burden. A lower degree of social distancing was associated with better functional health and lower symptom burden. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on functional health and symptom burden in the Spanish general population. The comparison of before and during the pandemic can be used to benchmark results raised only during the pandemic.

PD-L1 (B7-H1, CD274) est un ligand de PD-1 (CD279), récepteur co-inhibiteur (« checkpoint ») exprimé par les lymphocytes (Ly) T. Les synapses Eos-Ly médiées par PD-L1/PD-1 inhibent les réponses des Ly T. Nous formulons l’hypothèse que l’Eos en tant que cellule de première ligne pourrait contribuer à l’épuisement immunitaire lié au COVID-19. Méthodes La neurotoxine dérivée des éosinophiles (EDN), une protéine granulaire des Eos, a été mesurée dans le sérum de 53 patients atteints de COVID-19 confirmé par PCR et de 11 sujets témoins. L’EDN sérique renseigne sur le contenu granulaire des Eos. Le ratio EDN/Eos a été comparé entre les groupes de gravité et les points de suivi. L’EDN a été mesurée par méthode ImmunoCAP (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Uppsala, Suède). Résultats Les groupes patients et témoins étaient comparables en termes d’âge (patients : médiane 44 ans, extrêmes 18–87 ; témoins : 36 ans, 19–74) et de sex-ratio. Les patients atteints de COVID-19 ont présenté des formes légères (42) ou modérées (11). Le ratio EDN/Eos augmentait précocement, 24h après l’apparition des symptômes, avec un maximum pendant la première semaine et une décroissance progressive jusqu’à des valeurs similaires à celles observées chez les témoins. Le maximum était plus élevé dans les formes modérées par opposition aux formes légères (31 600 contre 852, p <10e–4). Le retour aux valeurs normales a été atteint dès la fin de la 3e semaine dans les formes légères (500 contre 543 chez les témoins), mais seulement après le 3e mois dans les formes modérées (542 à partir du 3e mois). Discussion L’analyse des niveaux d’EDN en fonction du nombre d’Eos suggère une activation précoce de l’Eos au cours du COVID-19, proportionnelle à la gravité et culminant au cours de la première semaine après l’apparition des symptômes. Conclusion Cette activation éosinophilique précoce pourrait contribuer à la modulation des réponses immunitaires adaptatives, notamment des Ly T. De plus, des niveaux élevés d’EDN circulant peuvent contribuer à l’inflammation systémique et locale du COVID-19.","Abecassis, A.; Sereme, Y.; Michel, M.; Ménard, A.; Perrier, R.; Sahli, W.; Gautret, P.; Vitte, J.",Revue Française d'Allergologie,461,1

This study examined the association between patients' HLA genotype and serum ferritin level modulation and also assessed the effect of serum ferritin levels on infection severity/mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and thirty-six COVID-19 Saudi patients were divided into two groups according to their ferritin levels: group 1 (<500 ng/mL, N = 67) and group 2 (>500 ng/mL, N = 69). HLA genotyping (class I and II) was carried out through the rPCR-SSO method. RESULTS: High serum ferritin levels were associated with a significant increase in infection severity, as 75% of ICU patients showed high levels of ferritin compared to 43% of patients with moderate symptoms, p = .002. This elevation indicated a gender skew in that 56% of the infected male patients displayed high ferritin levels compared to 36.6% of the female patients, p = .03. In terms of mortality, 74% of patients with fatal outcomes had a high level of serum ferritin compared to 47% of recovered patients, p = .039. There was a significant difference in the HLA frequency between the two groups, with a predominance of HLA-A*01 in the low-ferritin group (19.4 vs. 6.5%, p = .002, pc = .016) and predominance of C*03 in the high ferritin group (10.9 vs. 3%, p = .047, pc = .27). CONCLUSION: High serum ferritin levels are associated with an increase in COVID-19 severity, which may be affected by HLA polymorphism.","Naemi, Fatmah M A; Al-Adwani, Shurooq; Al-Nazawi, Ashwaq; Al-Khatabi, Heba",Infect Dis (Lond),461,3

To prevent and control BRSV infection, further knowledge on virus shedding and transmission potential in individual animals is required. This study aimed to detect viral RNA and infective virions during BRSV infection to evaluate duration of the transmission period and correlation with clinical signs of disease. The outcome of BRSV re-exposure on calves, their housing environment and effect of introduction of sentinel calves was also investigated. A live animal experiment including 10 calves was conducted over 61 days. Initially, two calves were inoculated with a non-passaged BRSV field isolate. Two days later, six naïve calves (EG: Exposed group) were introduced for commingling and four weeks later, another two naïve calves (SG: Sentinel group) were introduced. Seven weeks after commingling, EG animals were re-inoculated. Clinical examination was performed daily. Nasal swabs were collected regularly and analysed for viral RNA by RT-ddPCR, while virus isolation was performed in cell culture. BRSV serology was performed with ELISA. RESULTS: All the EG calves seroconverted and showed clinical signs of respiratory disease. Viral RNA was detected from days 1–27 after exposure, while the infective virus was isolated on day 6 and 13. On day 19, all animals were seropositive and virus could not be isolated. Total clinical score for respiratory signs corresponded well with the shedding of viral RNA. The SG animals, introduced 27 days after exposure, remained negative for BRSV RNA and stayed seronegative throughout the study. Inoculation of the EG calves seven weeks after primary infection did not lead to new shedding of viral RNA or clinical signs of disease. CONCLUSION: Viral RNA was detected in nasal swabs from the calves up to four weeks after exposure. The detection and amount of viral RNA corresponded well with the degree of respiratory signs. The calves were shedding infective virions for a considerable shorter period, and naïve calves introduced after four weeks were not infected. Infected calves were protected from reinfection for at least seven weeks. This knowledge is useful to prevent spread of BRSV.","Klem, Thea Blystad; Sjurseth, Siri Kulberg; Sviland, Ståle; Gjerset, Britt; Myrmel, Mette; Stokstad, Maria",BMC Vet Res,461,1

Here, we contribute to the growing body of literature on emerging variants by evaluating the impact of single mutations on the overall antigenicity of selected variants and their binding to the ACE2 receptor. We observe a differential contribution of single mutants to the global variants phenotype related to ACE2 interaction and antigenicity. Using biolayer interferometry, we observe that enhanced ACE2 interaction is mostly modulated by a decrease in off-rate. Finally, we made the interesting observation that the Spikes from tested emerging variants bind better to ACE2 at 37°C compared to the D614G variant. Whether improved ACE2 binding at higher temperature facilitates emerging variants transmission remain to be demonstrated.","Gong, Shang Yu; Chatterjee, Debashree; Richard, Jonathan; Prévost, Jérémie; Tauzin, Alexandra; Gasser, Romain; Bo, Yuxia; Vézina, Dani; Goyette, Guillaume; Gendron-Lepage, Gabrielle; Medjahed, Halima; Roger, Michel; Côté, Marceline; Finzi, Andrés",Virology,461,1

For this reason, in the literature, the data obtained from psychophysical tests are few and based on small case series. Methods: A multicenter, cohort study conducted in seven European hospitals between March 22 and August 20, 2020. The Sniffin-Sticks test and the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center orthonasal olfaction test were used to objectively evaluate the olfactory function. Results: This study included 774 patients, of these 481 (62.1%) presented olfactory dysfunction (OD): 280 were hyposmic and 201 were anosmic. There was a significant difference between self-reported anosmia/hyposmia and psychophysical test results (p = 0.006). Patients with gastroesophageal disorders reported a significantly higher probability of presenting hyposmia (OR 1.86; p = 0.015) and anosmia (OR 2.425; p < 0.001). Fever, chest pain, and phlegm significantly increased the likelihood of having hyposmia but not anosmia or an olfactory disturbance. In contrast, patients with dyspnea, dysphonia, and severe-to-critical COVID-19 were significantly more likely to have no anosmia, while these symptoms had no effect on the risk of developing hyposmia or an OD. Conclusions: Psychophysical assessment represents a significantly more accurate assessment tool for olfactory function than patient self-reported clinical outcomes. Olfactory disturbances appear to be largely independent from the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the patients. The non-association with rhinitis symptoms and the high prevalence as a presenting symptom make olfactory disturbances an important symptom in the differential diagnosis between COVID-19 and common flu.","Vaira, Luigi Angelo; Lechien, Jerome R.; Khalife, Mohamad; Petrocelli, Marzia; Hans, Stephane; Distinguin, Lea; Salzano, Giovanni; Cucurullo, Marco; Doneddu, Piero; Salzano, Francesco Antonio; Biglioli, Federico; Journe, Fabrice; Piana, Andrea Fausto; De Riu, Giacomo; Saussez, Sven",Pathogens,461,16

Severe presentations of COVID-19 such as severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been associated with the post-viral activation and release of cytokine/chemokines which leads to a “cytokine storm” causing inflammatory response and destruction, mainly affecting the lungs. COVID-19 activation of transcription factor, NF-kappa B (NF-κB) in various cells such as macrophages of lung, liver, kidney, central nervous system, gastrointestinal system and cardiovascular system leads to production of IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-α, LT-α, LT-β, GM-CSF, and various chemokines. The sensitised NF-κB in elderly and in patients with metabolic syndrome makes this set of population susceptible to COVID-19 and their worse complications, including higher mortality. Immunomodulation at the level of NF-κB activation and inhibitors of NF-κB (IκB) degradation along with TNF-α inhibition will potentially result in a reduction in the cytokine storm and alleviate the severity of COVID-19. Inhibition of NF-κB pathway has a potential therapeutic role in alleviating the severe form of COVID-19.","Hariharan, Apurva; Hakeem, Abdul Rahman; Radhakrishnan, Subathra; Reddy, Mettu Srinivas; Rela, Mohamed",Inflammopharmacology,461,5

Three different mechanisms have been described for the synthesis of SG RNAs. The first mechanism involves internal initiation on a (−)-strand RNA template and requires an internal SGP promoter. The second mechanism makes a prematurely terminated (−)-strand RNA which is used as template to make the SG RNA. The third mechanism uses discontinuous RNA synthesis while making the (−)-strand RNA templates. Most SG RNAs are translated into structural proteins or proteins related to pathogenesis: however other SG RNAs regulate the transition between translation and replication, function as riboregulators of replication or translation, or support RNA–RNA recombination.

It is important to monitor antimicrobial use to better understand trends and patterns in antimicrobial resistance. There is no monitoring of antimicrobial use in companion animals in Canada. To explore how the use of electronic medical records could contribute to the ongoing, systematic collection of antimicrobial use data in companion animals, anonymized electronic medical records were extracted from 12 participating companion animal practices and warehoused at the University of Calgary. We used the pre-diagnostic, clinical features of diarrhea as the case definition in this study. Using text-mining technologies, cases of diarrhea were described by each of the following variables: diagnostic laboratory tests performed, the etiological diagnosis and antimicrobial therapies. The ability of the text miner to accurately describe the cases for each of the variables was evaluated. It could not reliably classify cases in terms of diagnostic tests or etiological diagnosis; a manual review of a random sample of 500 diarrhea cases determined that 88/500 (17.6%) of the target cases underwent diagnostic testing of which 36/88 (40.9%) had an etiological diagnosis. Text mining, compared to a human reviewer, could accurately identify cases that had been treated with antimicrobials with high sensitivity (92%, 95% confidence interval, 88.1%–95.4%) and specificity (85%, 95% confidence interval, 80.2%–89.1%). Overall, 7400/15,928 (46.5%) of pets presenting with diarrhea were treated with antimicrobials. Some temporal trends and patterns of the antimicrobial use are described.

Recent studies try to model how the number of COVID-19 infections will likely grow and impact the demand for hospitalization services at national and regional levels. However, less attention has been paid to the geographic access to COVID-19 healthcare services and to hospitals’ response capacity at the local level, particularly in urban areas in the Global South. This paper shows how transport accessibility analysis can provide actionable information to help improve healthcare coverage and responsiveness. It analyzes accessibility to COVID-19 healthcare at high spatial resolution in the 20 largest cities of Brazil. Using network-distance metrics, we estimate the vulnerable population living in areas with poor access to healthcare facilities that could either screen or hospitalize COVID-19 patients. We then use a new balanced floating catchment area (BFCA) indicator to estimate spatial, income, and racial inequalities in access to hospitals with intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilators while taking into account congestion effects. Based on this analysis, we identify substantial social and spatial inequalities in access to health services during the pandemic. The availability of ICU equipment varies considerably between cities, and it is substantially lower among black and poor communities. The study maps territorial inequalities in healthcare access and reflects on different policy lessons that can be learned for other countries based on the Brazilian case.","Pereira, Rafael H.M.; Braga, Carlos Kauê Vieira; Servo, Luciana Mendes; Serra, Bernardo; Amaral, Pedro; Gouveia, Nelson; Paez, Antonio",Soc Sci Med,461,0

The COVID pandemic has had a major impact on healthcare in hospitals, including the diagnosis and treatment of infections. Hospital-acquired infective endocarditis (HAIE) is a severe complication of medical procedures that has shown a progressive increase in recent years. Objectives. to determine whether the incidence of HAIE during the first two months of the epidemic (March-April 2020) was higher than previously observed and to describe the clinical characteristics of these cases. The probability of studied event (HAIE) during the studied period was calculate by Poisson distribution. Results. Four cases of HAIE were diagnosed in our institution during the study period. The incidence of HAIE during the study period was 2/patient-month and 0.25/patient-month during the previous 5 years (p=0.024). Two cases appeared during admission for COVID-19 with pulmonary involvement treated with metilprednisolone and tocilizumab. The other two cases were admitted to the hospital during the epidemic. All cases underwent central venous and urinary catheterization during admission. The etiology of HAIE was Enterococcus faecalis (2 cases), Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans (one case each). A source of infection was identified in three cases (central venous catheter, peripheral venous catheter, sternal wound infection, respectively). One patient was operated on. There were no fatalities during the first 30 days of follow-up. Conclusion. The incidence of HAIE during COVID-19 pandemic in our institution was higher than usual. In order to reduce the risk of this serious infection, optimal catheter care, appropriate use of corticosteroids and interleukin antagonists and early treatment of every local infection should be prioritized during coronavirus outbreaks.","Ramos-Martinez, Antonio; Fernndez-Cruz, Ana; Dominguez, Fernando; Forteza, Alberto; Cobo, Marta; Sanchez-Romero, Isabel; asensio, Angel",,461,1

We excluded patients treated with other immunomodulant drugs, receiving low dose of corticosteroids and those receiving corticosteroids after 72h from admission. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality form hospital admission. The main exposure variable was corticosteroid therapy at dosage of ≥0.5 mg/kg of prednisone equivalents. It was introduced as binomial covariate in a logistic regression model for primary endpoint and inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score. RESULTS: Of 1717 patients with COVID-19 evaluated, 513 patients were included in the study; of these 170 (33%) were treated with corticosteroids. During the hospitalization 166 (34%) patients reached the primary outcome [60/170 (35%) in the corticosteroid group and 106/343 (31%) in the non-corticosteroid group]. At multivariable analysis corticosteroid treatment was not associated with lower 30-day mortality rate [aOR 0.59 (0.20-1.74), p=0.33].

However, challenges remain in making data widely available, accessible, and useful towards improving population health. While traditional, government-supported data sources and comparable data are most often used to characterize social determinants, there are still capacity and management constraints on data availability and use. Conversely, privately held data may not be shared. This study reviews and discusses the nature, sources, and uses of data on SDH, with illustrations from two middle-income countries: Kenya and the Philippines. The review highlights opportunities presented by new data sources, including the use of big data technologies, to capture data on social determinants that can be useful to inform population health. We conducted a search between October 2010 and September 2020 for grey and scientific publications on social determinants using a search strategy in PubMed and a manual snowball search. We assessed data sources and the data environment in both Kenya and the Philippines. We found limited evidence of the use of new sources of data to study the wider SDH, as most of the studies available used traditional sources. There was also no evidence of qualitative big data being used. Kenya has more publications using new data sources, except on the labor determinant, than the Philippines. The Philippines has a more consistent distribution of the use of new data sources across the HEALTHY determinants than Kenya, where there is greater variation of the number of publications across determinants. The results suggest that both countries use limited SDH data from new data sources. This limited use could be due to a number of factors including the absence of standardized indicators of SDH, inadequate trust and acceptability of data collection methods, and limited infrastructure to pool, analyze, and translate data.

Worries during pregnancy can affect women’s well-being. We investigated worry and well-being and associated factors among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on 484 pregnant women using an online questionnaire. Sampling was performed in a period between May 5 and Aug 5, 2020. Inclusion criteria were having a single healthy fetus and having no significant psychological disorder. We collected the data using the Persian versions of the World Health Organization’s Well-Being Index (WHO-5 Well-Being Index) and the Cambridge Worry Scale. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to identify predictors of women’s worry and well-being. RESULTS: The mean total scores of the WHO-5 Well-Being Index and the percentage of WHO-5 score < 50 were 64.9 ± 29.0 and 24.4%, respectively. Predictors of women’s worry are the increased level of fear of COVID-19 (OR = 6.40, p < 0.001), a low family income (OR = 3.41, p < 0.001), employment status (OR = 1.86, p = 0.019), nulliparity (OR = 1.68, p = 0.024), having a COVID-19 infected person among relatives (OR = 2.45, p = 0.036), having a history of abortion (OR = 1.86, p = 0.012), having participated in the study after the first wave of COVID-19 outbreak (OR = 2.328, p = 0.003), and women’s age < 30 year (OR = 2.11, p = 0.002). Predictors of low level of well-being in pregnant women are worry about their own health and relationships (OR = 1.789, p = .017), worry about fetus health (OR = 1.946, p = 0.009), and having at least one infected person with COVID-19 among relatives (OR = 2.135, p = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of women experiencing a low well-being state was relatively high. This result is worthy of attention by health care providers and policy makers.

Because of high exposure, HCWs are at an increased risk of contracting the disease. AIMS: This study aims to assess the level of precautionary measures, both at home and the workplace, amongst medical doctors who were on duty during the national lockdown in Jordan. METHODS: A cross‐sectional study was conducted between March 23 and May 1, 2020, utilising a self‐administered web‐based questionnaire to examine a sample of medical doctors (n = 270) working at different healthcare institutions in Jordan. Likert scale was used to code the data and generate means and percentages. RESULTS: The most practiced on‐duty precautionary measures were cleaning hands with water and disinfectant for more than 20 seconds (47.4%), followed by proper hygiene before and during meals (38.9%). The most practiced off‐duty measures were taking off clothes before entering the residential place (65.9%) and prohibiting visitors (58.1%). Overall, the mean work protection percentage score was 73.8% (range: 28%‐100%), while the mean home safety percentage score was 71.3% (range: 25%‐100%). Work protection score was positively correlated with the home safety score. Female doctors were found to be more precautious at home than males. Doctors with chronic illness(es) were found to be less precautious than their healthier counterparts. Participants who isolated themselves expressed the highest level of home safety practice. Doctors who reported to smoke were found more precautious at home and doctors who preferred to work during lockdowns were more precautious at the workplace. CONCLUSION: The level of precautionary behaviour of medical doctors in Jordan was not optimal. More attention and efforts are needed to enhance the adherence of doctors to precautionary guidance.

This class of drugs is known for reducing cardiovascular events and delay in the progression of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However recent data has shown that SGLT2 inhibitors, particularly empagliflozin, carry the risk of inducing euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis under certain circumstances such as acute illness, and decreased carbohydrate intake, decrease in dose, or discontinuation of insulin.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study in all public schools in Catalonia was conducted using publicly available data assessing the association between the number of reported SARS-CoV-2 cases among students and staff in weeks 1–2 (Sept 14-27th, 2020) of the academic year with school SARS-CoV-2 incidence among students in weeks 4–5. A multilevel Poisson regression model adjusted for the community incidence in the corresponding basic health area (BHA) and the type of school (primary or secondary), with random effects at the sanitary region and BHA levels, was performed. RESULTS: A total of 2184 public schools opened on September 14th with 778,715 students. Multivariate analysis showed a significant association between the total number of SARS-CoV-2 cases in a centre in weeks 1–2 and the SARS-CoV-2 school incidence among students in weeks 4–5 (Risk Ratio (RR) 1.074, 95% CI 1.044–1.105, p-value <0.001). The adjusted BHA incidence in the first two weeks was associated with school incidence in weeks 4–5 (RR 1.002, 95% CI 1.002–1.003, p-value <0.001). Secondary schools showed an increased incidence in weeks 4 and 5 (RR primary vs secondary 1.709 95% CI 1.599–1.897, p-value <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Safety measures adopted by schools were not enough to stop related-to-school transmission in students and could be improved. The safest way to keep schools open is to reduce community transmission down to a minimum.","Llupià, Anna; Borràs-Santos, Alícia; Guinovart, Caterina; Utzet, Mireia; Moriña, David; Puig, Joaquim",PLoS One,461,29

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in selected national, regional referral and general hospital facilities in Uganda and in the eastern part of DR Congo from 1st August 2020 to 30th October 2020. Data was analysed using Stata version 15. RESULTS: The participation rate was of 37.5 % (72/192) for both countries. None of the hospitals fulfilled the readiness criteria for safe surgical care provision in both countries. The mean bed capacity of participating health facilities (HF) was 184 in Eastern DR Congo and 274 in Uganda with an average surgical ward bed capacity of 22.3 % (41/184) and 20.4 % (56/274) respectively. The mean number of operating rooms was 2 and 3 in Eastern DR Congo and Uganda respectively. Nine hospitals (12.5 %) reported being able to test for Ebola and 25 (34.7 %) being able to test for COVID-19. Postponing of elective surgeries was reported by 10 (13.9) participating hospitals. Only 7 (9.7 %) hospitals reported having a specific operating room for suspect or confirmed cases of Ebola or COVID-19.

It is not clear how the N protein mediates such distinct functions. The N protein contains two RNA-binding domains surrounded by regions of intrinsic disorder. Phosphorylation of the central disordered region promotes the protein’s transcriptional function, but the underlying mechanism is not known. Here we show that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2, together with viral RNA, forms biomolecular condensates. Unmodified N protein forms partially ordered gel-like condensates and discrete 15-nm particles based on multivalent RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. Phosphorylation reduces these interactions, generating a more liquid-like droplet. We propose that distinct oligomeric states support the two functions of the N protein: unmodified protein forms a structured oligomer that is suited for nucleocapsid assembly, and phosphorylated protein forms a liquid-like compartment for viral genome processing.","Carlson, Christopher R.; Asfaha, Jonathan B.; Ghent, Chloe M.; Howard, Conor J.; Hartooni, Nairi; Safari, Maliheh; Frankel, Alan D.; Morgan, David O.",Mol Cell,461,20

The aim of the study was to compare the annual incidence of selected VPCDs in the EU (European Union) and EFTA (European Free Trade Association) countries in the period of the last 5 years (2014–2019 or other intervals, depending on data availability), and the country-specific vaccine schedules. Methods: VPCD incidence rates in Europe were based on “The Surveillance Atlas of Infectious Diseases” by the ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control); vaccination schedules were based on ECDC reports. Results: The obligation to vaccinate was not universal, and it generally only applied to two preparations: the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine and the one against polio. During the study, the situation associated with mumps did not change or improve in individual countries; the median incidence amounted to 30 cases. The median incidence associated with rubella amounted to 1 case, but in a few countries, it grew very rapidly, i.e., in Germany, Italy, and Romania; in Poland, the incidence was clearly decreasing, from 5923 to 1532 cases. The most dynamic situation concerned measles. The total median was 2.4 cases per 100,000 population; the only one country with falling incidence was Germany. The diseases associated with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis remained at a stable level in all analyzed countries. Conclusion: Vaccine schedules differ among the countries, so does the epidemiological situation of selected diseases. Morbidity on measles was the most disturbing phenomenon: the incidence rate increased in almost 40% of all countries, regardless of the obligation to vaccinate. The increasing incidence of VPCD may be due to anti-vaccine movements, the activity of which is often caused by mistrust and spreading misinformation. In order to better prevent the increase in morbidity, standardization of vaccine schedules and documentation should be considered in the EU countries.","Jachowicz, Estera; Gębicka, Magdalena; Plakhtyr, Daria; Shynkarenko, Myroslav; Urbanowicz, Juri; Mach, Maciej; Czepiel, Jacek; Marchewka, Jakub; Wójkowska-Mach, Jadwiga",Vaccines (Basel),461,1

Several studies have documented the course of viral infection in postnatally infected pigs; however, very little is known regarding sites of virus replication during persistent infection of pigs exposed to PRRSV in utero. In this study, virus replication and PRRSV-specific antibody were followed for several hundred days in a group of pigs derived from three sows infected at 90 days of gestation with PRRSV isolate VR-2332. Eighty-four percent of pigs were born viremic with a mortality of 54% within 21 days after birth. At approximately 60 days sera from pigs were negative for virus by virus isolation. Analysis of virus replication in the tissues of pigs randomly sacrificed between 63 and 132 days showed no evidence of virus in lung and other non-lymphoid organs. However, virus was easily recovered from tonsil and lymph nodes and in situ hybridization identified these tissues as sites of virus replication. Even though replication was at a low level, virus was easily transmitted to sentinel pigs. By 260 days pigs became seronegative and did not transmit virus to sentinel pigs. Sacrifice of remaining pigs after 300 days showed no evidence of virus in blood and tissues. This study shows that congenital PRRSV-infected pigs can support virus replication for an extended period during which virus replication is primarily restricted to tonsil and lymph nodes.","Rowland, Raymond R.R; Lawson, Steven; Rossow, Kurt; Benfield, David A",Veterinary Microbiology,461,23

The restriction of movement/lockdown policy instituted by various governments heavily affected local and national food production as farmers could not go to their farmlands. More so, there was price gouging on raw food items as local farmers were reducing cultivation and harvest because of their safety. The lockdown also affected the transportation of food products from farms and local companies to the market and across inter-state/province borders. Additionally, many human infections traceable to disease outbreak from animal origin suggest a great risk of exposure to infectious agents by live animal farmers. In combating this menace, local food production needs to be encouraged more, while measures should be put in place to facilitate farmer's participation in government regulations on enforcing biosecurity, health standards, disease monitoring, and surveillance practices.","Ejeromedoghene, O.; Tesi, J.N.; Uyanga, V.A.; Adebayo, A.O.; Nwosisi, M.C.; Tesi, G.O.; Akinyeye, R.O.",Ethics Med Public Health,461,16

We focalize on the interpretation of the path followed by a learner watching an educational video, and the way they navigate the pedagogical sequences of that video, in order to predict whether a learner can pass or fail the video course. Learner’s video clicks are collected and classified. We applied educational data mining technique using K-nearest Neighbours and Multilayer Perceptron algorithms to predict learner’s performance. The classification results are acceptable, the kNN classifier achieves the best results with an average accuracy of 65.07%. The experimental result indicates that learners’ performance could be predicted, we notice a correlation between video sequence viewing behavior and learning performances. This method may help instructors understand the way learners watch educational videos.

Subjects and Methods: Data on confirmed cases and number of deaths due to coronavirus infection were retrieved from the WHO as on 30 March 2020, and examined for the various income level countries, per the World Bank criteria. The CFR was calculated country-wise and estimated for the various groups such as low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high-income, and the data was analyzed. RESULTS: The overall CFR for the high income countries was 5.0%, compared with a CFR of 2.8% for low-income countries. The upper-middle-income countries showed a CFR of 4.3%, while the lower-middle-income countries stood at 3.7%. The results from our study predict that the maximum CFR in high-income countries will be contained at approximately 5% (95% CI). The CFR for the low, lower-middle, and upper-middle-income countries will range between 2.8 and 4.3% (95% CI). CONCLUSION: COVID-19, irrespective of its transmissibility, produces a lower CFR compared with that of SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov, although COVID-19 has infected eight times more countries than MERS-Cov and SARS-Cov, and caused a higher number of deaths.

We tested the hypothesis that genes causing primary HLH regulate pathways linking pulmonary thromboembolism to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using novel network-informed computational algorithms. This approach led to the identification of Neutrophils Extracellular Traps (NETs) as plausible mediators of vascular thrombosis in severe COVID-19 in children and adults. Taken together, the network-informed analysis led us to propose the following model: the release of NETs in response to inflammatory signals acting in concert with SARS-CoV-2 damage the endothelium and direct platelet-activation promoting abnormal coagulation leading to serious complications of COVID-19. The underlying hypothesis is that genetic and/or environmental conditions that favor the release of NETs may predispose individuals to thrombotic complications of COVID-19 due to an increase risk of abnormal coagulation. This would be a common pathogenic mechanism in conditions including autoimmune/infectious diseases, hematologic and metabolic disorders.","Ding, J.; Hostallero, D. E.; El Khili, M. R.; Fonseca, G.

With the closure of offices and educational institutions, and the emerging norm of work from home and online education, along with the lack of services of domestic worker, the need to perform unpaid chores in the household has increased. Simultaneously, the requirements of social distancing and sanitization have created new unpaid chores. Owing to the sexual division of labour, and gendered roles and social norms of performing domestic and care work, the burden of unpaid work falls disproportionately on women. In this context, the objective of the paper is to study the impact of COVID-19 on time spent on unpaid work and the underlying gender differences in the urban centres in India. Specifically, the paper will do a comparative analysis of the gender differences in time spent on unpaid work before and during the lockdown, and analyse the reasons for the same.","Chauhan, Priyanshi",Gender Issues,461,27

We aimed to develop a flexible model to estimate the impact of delayed diagnosis and treatment initiation on survival outcomes and healthcare costs based on a shift in the disease stage at treatment initiation. Methods: The stage-shift model estimates population-level health economic outcomes by weighting disease stage-specific outcomes by the distribution of stages at treatment initiation, assuming delays lead to stage-progression. It allows for extrapolation of population-level survival data using parametric distributions to calculate the expected survival in life years. The model was demonstrated based on an analysis of the impact of 3 and 6-month delays for stage I breast cancer, colorectal cancer and lung cancer patients, and for T1 melanoma, based on Australian data. In the absence of patient-level data about time to stage progression, two approaches were explored to estimate the proportion of patients that would experience a stage shift following the delay: 1) based on the relation between time to treatment initiation and overall survival (breast, colorectal and lung cancer), and 2) based on the tumour growth rate (melanoma). The model is available on http://stage-shift.personex.nl/. Results: A shift from stage I to stage II due to a 6-month delay is least likely for colorectal cancer patients, with an estimated proportion of 3% of the stage I patients diagnosed in 2020 progressing to stage II, resulting in 11 excess deaths after 5 years and a total of 96 life years lost over a 10-year time horizon. For breast and lung cancer, progression from stage I to stage II due to a 6-month delay were slightly higher at 5% (breast cancer) and 8% (lung cancer), resulting in 25 and 43 excess deaths after 5 years, and 239 and 373 life years lost over a 10-year time horizon, respectively. For melanoma, with 32% of T1 patients progressing to T2 disease following a 6-month delay, the model estimated 270 excess death after 5 years and 2584 life years lost over a 10-year time horizon. Conclusions: Using a conservative 3-month delay in diagnosis and treatment initiation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this study predicts nearly 90 excess deaths and $12 million excess healthcare costs in Australia over 5 years for the in 2020 diagnosed patients for 4 cancers. If the delays increase to 6 months, excess mortality and cost approach nearly 350 deaths and $46 million in Australia. More accurate data on stage of disease during and after the COVID-19 pandemic are critical to obtain more reliable estimates.","Degeling, K.; Baxter, N.

To date, no children younger than 12 years have been enrolled in clinical trials. Key challenges and knowledge gaps that must be addressed include (1) rationale for vaccines in children, (2) possible effects of immune maturation during childhood, (3) ethical concerns, (4) unique needs of children with developmental disorders and chronic conditions, (5) health inequities, and (6) vaccine hesitancy. Because COVID-19 is minimally symptomatic in the vast majority of children, a higher acceptable risk threshold is required when evaluating pediatric clinical trials. Profound differences in innate and adaptive immunity during childhood and adolescence are known to affect vaccine responsiveness for a variety of childhood diseases. COVID-19 and the accompanying social disruption, such as the school shutdowns, has been disproportionately damaging to minority and low-income children. In this commentary, we briefly address each of these key issues, specify research gaps, and suggest a broader learning health system approach to accelerate testing and clinical trial development for an ethical and effective strategy to implement a pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine as rapidly and safely as possible. IMPACT: As the US begins an unprecedented implementation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, substantial knowledge gaps have yet to be addressed regarding vaccinations in the pediatric population. Maturational changes in the immune system during childhood have influenced the effectiveness of pediatric vaccines for other diseases and conditions, and could affect SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responsiveness in children. Given that COVID-19 disease is far milder in the majority of children than in adults, the risk–benefit of a pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine must be carefully weighed. The needs of children with developmental disabilities and with chronic disease must be addressed. Minority and low-income children have been disproportionately adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; care must be taken to address issues of health equity regarding pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials and allocation. Research and strategies to address general vaccine hesitancy in communities must be addressed in the context of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Cooper, Dan M.; Afghani, Behnoush; Byington, Carrie L.; Cunningham, Coleen K.; Golub, Sidney; Lu, Kim D.; Radom-Aizik, Shlomit; Ross, Lainie Friedman; Singh, Jasjit; Smoyer, William E.; Lucas, Candice Taylor; Tunney, Jessica; Zaldivar, Frank; Ulloa, Erlinda R.",Pediatr Res,461,16

METHODS: We retrospectively identified COVID‐19‐positive patients 18 years and older that had neurology symptoms on presentation requiring neurology consultation between March 14, 2020 and May 18, 2020. The patients were then classified into those with typical COVID‐19 symptoms and those without. Demographic, clinical symptoms, laboratory result, and clinical outcomes were collected. RESULTS: Out of 282 patients who had neurology consult during this period, we identified 56 (mean age 69.2 years, 57% women) who tested COVID‐19‐positive and had neurologic symptoms on initial presentation. Of these, 23 patients (mean age 65.2 years, 52% women) had no typical COVID‐19 symptoms while 33 did (mean age 72.2 years, 60% woman). In both groups, impaired consciousness was the most common initial neurologic symptom, followed by stroke, unsteady gait, headache, seizure, syncopal event, acute vision changes, and intracranial hemorrhage. Out of the 23 patients without typical COVID‐19 symptoms on presentation, 10 went on to develop typical symptoms with 8 needing supplemental oxygen and one requiring mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Patients who have COVID‐19 can present with serious neurologic symptoms such as impaired consciousness and stroke even without typical COVID‐19 symptoms. Those without typical COVID‐19 symptoms can later develop typical symptoms severe enough to need respiratory support.","Chuang, David T.; Aydemir, Seyhmus; Magda, Paul; Thomas, Crystal; Zarnegar, Reza",Acta Neurol Scand,461,24

There has been a reduction in clinical activities of residents. The purpose of this paper is to measure and compare the psychological well-being of dental versus medical residents during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study whereby trainees of a hospital in New York City were sent a questionnaire. Participants were from the dental and medical departments. Psychological measures of depression and PTSD were assessed utilizing the PHQ-9 and IES-R questionnaire. Other variables compared were age, gender, smoking status, living situation and comorbidities. Data analysis utilized chi-squared (X(2)) and t-tests. Bivariate correlation and linear regression analyses was also utilized. RESULTS: The survey was sent to 19 dental (Dental) and 171 medical (MD) residents. There were 66 participants. The response rate was 63.16 and 35.09% for the Dental and MD residents, respectively. The mean age for the Dental and MD residents, respectively, was 29.62 ± 2.09 and 34.82 ± 9.32 (p=0.014). 81% of the Dental respondents were male and 33.3% of the MD respondents were male (p<0.001). The mean PHQ-9 score was 18.29 ± 2.88 vs 7.24 ± 7.41 for Dental and MD residents, respectively (p<0.001). A higher score represents increased severity of depression. The Dental residents scored 61.9 ± 3.90 on the IES-R vs 30.36 ± 24.67 (p<0.001). A higher score indicates a greater frequency of intrusive thoughts and avoidance. 41.6% of Dental and 13.3% of MD residents tested positive; 25% of Dental and 28.9% of MD residents self-reported symptoms for COVID-19. Being positive or symptomatic resulted in statistically significant higher IES-R and PHQ-9 scores. CONCLUSION: Dental residents and being positive or symptomatic for COVID-19 resulted in higher PHQ-9 and IES-R scores. Being aware of the impact of COVID-19 is an important step in providing intervention.","Bhalla, Natasha; Suneja, Nishant; Kobryn, Andriy; Lew, Sungyub; Dym, Harry",J Oral Maxillofac Surg,461,20

It is designed to be administered in person; however, in-person assessments are costly, and are difficult during the current COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of performing the PACC assessment with videoconferencing, and to compare the validity of this remote PACC with the in-person PACC obtained previously. METHODS: Participants from the HEalth and Ageing Data IN the Game of football (HEADING) Study who had already undergone an in-person assessment were re-contacted and re-assessed remotely. The correlation between the two PACC scores was estimated. The difference between the two PACC scores was calculated and used in multiple linear regression to assess which variables were associated with a difference in PACC scores. FINDINGS: Of the 43 participants who were invited to this external study, 28 were re-assessed. The median duration in days between the in-person and the remote assessments was 236.5 days (7.9 months) (IQR 62.5). There was a strong positive correlation between the two assessments for the PACC score, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0·82 (95% CI 0·66, 0·98). The multiple linear regression found that the only predictor of the PACC difference was the time between assessments. INTERPRETATION: This study provides evidence on the feasibility of performing cognitive tests online, with the PACC tests being successfully administered through videoconferencing. This is relevant, especially during times when face-to-face assessments cannot be performed.

Here, we performed a genome-wide barcoded-CRISPRa screen to identify novel host factors that enable SARS-CoV-2 infection. Beyond known host proteins, i.e., ACE2, TMPRSS2, and NRP1, we identified multiple host components, among which LDLRAD3, TMEM30A, and CLEC4G were confirmed as functional receptors for SARS-CoV-2. All these membrane proteins bind directly to spike’s N-terminal domain (NTD). Their essential and physiological roles have been confirmed in either neuron or liver cells. In particular, LDLRAD3 and CLEC4G mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection in an ACE2-independent fashion.

METHODS A broad systematic search of peer-reviewed publications related to global EM indexed on PubMed and in the gray literature was conducted. The titles and abstracts of the articles on this list were screened by members of the Global Emergency Medicine Literature Review team to identify those that met our criteria of original research or review articles in the domains of Disaster and Humanitarian Response, Emergency Care in Resource-Limited Settings, and Emergency Medicine Development. Those articles that met these screening criteria were then scored using one of three scoring templates appropriate to the article type. Those articles that scored in the top 5% then underwent in-depth narrative summarization. RESULTS The 2020 GEMLR search initially identified 35,970 articles, more than 50% more than last year's search. From these, 364 were scored based on their full text. Nearly three-fourths of the scored articles constituted original research, of which nearly three-fourths employed quantitative research methods. Nearly 10% of the articles identified this year were directly related to COVID-19. Research involving Emergency Care in Resource-Limited Settings again constituted most of the articles in this year's review, accounting for more than 60% of the literature scored. A total of 20 articles underwent in-depth narrative critiques. CONCLUSIONS The number of studies relevant to global EM identified by our search was very similar to last year.

The present study aimed to develop and validate machine learning-based models for predicting in-hospital mortality using easily available data at hospital admission among the patients with accidental hypothermia. METHOD: This study was secondary analysis of multi-center retrospective cohort study (J-point registry) including patients with accidental hypothermia. Adult patients with body temperature 35.0 °C or less at emergency department were included. Prediction models for in-hospital mortality using machine learning (lasso, random forest, and gradient boosting tree) were made in development cohort from six hospitals, and the predictive performance were assessed in validation cohort from other six hospitals. As a reference, we compared the SOFA score and 5A score. RESULTS: We included total 532 patients in the development cohort [N = 288, six hospitals, in-hospital mortality: 22.0% (64/288)], and the validation cohort [N = 244, six hospitals, in-hospital mortality 27.0% (66/244)]. The C-statistics [95% CI] of the models in validation cohorts were as follows: lasso 0.784 [0.717–0.851] , random forest 0.794[0.735–0.853], gradient boosting tree 0.780 [0.714–0.847], SOFA 0.787 [0.722–0.851], and 5A score 0.750[0.681–0.820]. The calibration plot showed that these models were well calibrated to observed in-hospital mortality. Decision curve analysis indicated that these models obtained clinical net-benefit. CONCLUSION: This multi-center retrospective cohort study indicated that machine learning-based prediction models could accurately predict in-hospital mortality in validation cohort among the accidental hypothermia patients. These models might be able to support physicians and patient’s decision-making. However, the applicability to clinical settings, and the actual clinical utility is still unclear; thus, further prospective study is warranted to evaluate the clinical usefulness.

We found strong links between having at least one psychiatric diagnosis and the occurrence of infection (P = 2.16 × 10(−208), OR = 1.72). The SNP heritability of susceptibility to infection ranged from ~2 to ~7% in samples of differing psychiatric diagnosis statuses (suggesting the environment as a major contributor to susceptibility), and polygenic risk scores moderately but significantly explained infection status in an independent sample. We observed a genetic correlation of 0.496 (P = 2.17 × 10(−17)) between a diagnosis of infection and a psychiatric diagnosis. While our GWAS did not identify genome-wide significant associations, we found 90 suggestive (P ≤ 10(−5)) associations for susceptibility to infection. Our findings suggest a genetic component in susceptibility to infection and indicate that the occurrence of infections in individuals with mental illness may be in part genetically driven.","Nudel, Ron; Wang, Yunpeng; Appadurai, Vivek; Schork, Andrew J.; Buil, Alfonso; Agerbo, Esben; Bybjerg-Grauholm, Jonas; Børglum, Anders D.; Daly, Mark J.; Mors, Ole; Hougaard, David M.; Mortensen, Preben B.; Werge, Thomas; Nordentoft, Merete; Thompson, Wesley K.; Benros, Michael E.",Transl Psychiatry,461,26

In response to this disparity, the Infectious Diseases Society of America Clinical Affairs Committee has long endeavored to quantify the value of ID physicians to the system, which is challenging in part because of the many avenues through which they influence healthcare. We discuss data showing that ID physicians improve clinical outcomes, positively impact transitions of care, and direct system-level improvements through infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship. We identify areas where value-based care provides additional future opportunities for ID physicians. A Clinical Affairs Committee–sponsored study of ID physicians’ positive impact on patient outcomes shows that few medical specialties are better positioned to positively impact the Triple Aim approach—better health, better care, and lower per capita cost—that is the principle tenet of healthcare system reform.","McQuillen, Daniel P; MacIntyre, Ann T",J Infect Dis,461,3

The current Covid-19 pandemic is transforming ways of working, living, and relating to each other on a global level, suddenly and dramatically. This paper focuses on the field of education to show how higher education institutions are undergoing radical transformations driven by the need to digitalize education and training processes in record time with academics who lack innate technological capabilities for online teaching. The university system must strive to overcome this situation to be competitive and provide high-quality education in a scenario of digital transformation, disruptive technological innovations, and accelerated change. To achieve these goals, this paper explains some barriers and challenges that universities encounter, as well as technological resources and methodologies they have used in the current scenario to transform higher education to face Covid-19 disruption.

Typically, virus production remains at a low level over extended periods, in the absence of lytic effects of replication. In this study, we demonstrate that persistently infected cells are very restricted in permissiveness for superinfection. By reconstitution experiments, using bovine brain gangliosides as artificial receptors, the degree of super-infection was markedly increased. Analysis of cellular receptor expression revealed reduced concentrations of sialoglycoproteins in general and a limited presentation of the major receptor gp40. Cocultures of persistently infected and uninfected cells (the latter carrying normal receptor levels) initiated a transient rise in virus titers. This kind of induction of virus synthesis appeared to be mainly receptor-linked, since a receptor-deprived subline, MDCK II, did not give rise to a similar effect. Susceptibility of MDCK II cocultures could be partly restored by ganglioside treatment. In accordance to related virus systems, these findings on influenza C virus suggest a role of cell receptor concentrations in the regulation of long-term persistence.","Marschall, M.; Meier-Ewert, H.; Herrler, G.; Zimmer, G.; Maassab, H.

To answer this question we designed and conducted a real-world long-term study, in collaboration with medical specialists, at the Fundación Cardioinfantil-Instituto de Cardiología clinic (Bogotá, Colombia) lasting 2.5 years. The study took place within the context of the outpatient phase of patients' cardiac rehabilitation programme and aimed to compare the patients' progress and adherence in the conventional cardiac rehabilitation programme (control condition) against rehabilitation supported by a fully autonomous socially assistive robot which continuously monitored the patients during exercise to provide immediate feedback and motivation based on sensory measures (robot condition). The explicit aim of the social robot is to improve patient motivation and increase adherence to the programme to ensure a complete recovery. We recruited 15 patients per condition. The cardiac rehabilitation programme was designed to last 36 sessions (18 weeks) per patient. The findings suggest that robot increases adherence (by 13.3%) and leads to faster completion of the programme. In addition, the patients assisted by the robot had more rapid improvement in their recovery heart rate, better physical activity performance and a higher improvement in cardiovascular functioning, which indicate a successful cardiac rehabilitation programme performance. Moreover, the medical staff and the patients acknowledged that the robot improved the patient motivation and adherence to the programme, supporting its potential in addressing the major challenges in rehabilitation programmes.","Céspedes, Nathalia; Irfan, Bahar; Senft, Emmanuel; Cifuentes, Carlos A.; Gutierrez, Luisa F.; Rincon-Roncancio, Mónica; Belpaeme, Tony; Múnera, Marcela",Front Neurorobot,461,2

Communityacquired human coronaviruses have long been recognized to cause common cold. However, zoonotic coronaviruses are now becoming more a global concern with the discovery of highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses causing severe respiratory diseases. Infections by these emerging human coronaviruses are characterized by less robust interferon production. Treatment of patients with recombinant interferon regimen promises beneficial outcomes, suggesting that compromised interferon expression might contribute at least partially to the severity of disease. The mechanisms by which coronaviruses evade host innate antiviral response are under intense investigations. This review focuses on the fierce arms race between host innate antiviral immunity and emerging human coronaviruses. Particularly, the host pathogen recognition receptors and the signal transduction pathways to mount an effective antiviral response against SARS and MERS coronavirus infection are discussed. On the other hand, the counter-measures evolved by SARS and MERS coronaviruses to circumvent host defense are also dissected. With a better understanding of the dynamic interaction between host and coronaviruses, it is hoped that insights on the pathogenesis of newly-identified highly pathogenic human coronaviruses and new strategies in antiviral development can be derived.

Despite the individual discrepancy, patients with MG share common muscle weakness, autoimmune dysfunction, and immunosuppressive treatment, which predispose them to infections that can trigger or exacerbate MG. Vaccination, as a mainstay of prophylaxis, is a major management strategy. However, the past years have seen growth in vaccine hesitancy, owing to safety and efficacy concerns. Ironically, vaccines, serving as an essential and effective means of defense, may induce similar immune cross-reactivity to what they are meant to prevent. Herein, we outline the progress in vaccination, review the current status, and postulate the clinical association among MG, vaccination, and immunosuppression. We also address safety and efficacy concerns of vaccination in MG, in relation to COVID-19. Since only a handful of studies have reported vaccination in individuals with MG, we further review the current clinical studies and guidelines in rheumatic diseases. Overall, our reviews offer a reference to guide future vaccine clinical decision-making and improve the management of MG patients.","Zhou, Qian; Zhou, Ran; Yang, Haojun; Yang, Huan",Front Immunol,461,1

Using recombinant ArkDPI S1 proteins, we conducted binding assays on chicken tracheas and embryonic chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). Protein histochemistry showed that the Y43H change allows for enhanced binding to trachea, whereas the ArkDPI S1 spike with H43 alone was able to bind CAM. Using Western blot under denaturing conditions, ArkDPI serotype-specific sera did not bind to S1 proteins with ∆344, suggesting that ∆344 alters antigenicity of S1. These findings are important because they propose that specific changes in S1 enhances virus fitness by more effective binding to host tissues (Y43H) and by evading a vaccine-induced antibody response (∆344).","Leyson, Christina; França, Monique; Jackwood, Mark; Jordan, Brian",Virology,461,24

Patients who died from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often had comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive lung disease. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a crucial factor that facilitates SARS-CoV2 to bind and enter host cells. To date, no study has assessed the ACE2 expression in the lungs of patients with these diseases. Here, we analyzed over 700 lung transcriptome samples of patients with comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 and found that ACE2 was highly expressed in these patients, compared to control individuals. This finding suggests that patients with such comorbidities may have higher chances of developing severe COVID-19. We also found other genes, such as RAB1A, that can be important for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung. Correlation and network analyses revealed many potential regulators of ACE2 in the human lung, including genes related to histone modifications, such as HAT1, HDAC2, and KDM5B. In fact, epigenetic marks found in ACE2 locus were compatible to with those promoted by KDM5B.

Here, we measure the impact of the announcement and implementation of lockdowns on human mobility patterns by analyzing aggregated mobility data from mobile phones. We find that following the announcement of lockdowns, both local and long distance movement increased. To examine how these behavioral responses to lockdown policies may contribute to epidemic spread, we developed a simple agent-based spatial model. We find that travel surges following announcements of lockdowns can increase seeding of the epidemic in rural areas, undermining the goal of the lockdown of preventing disease spread. Appropriate messaging surrounding the announcement of lockdowns and measures to decrease unnecessary travel are important for preventing these unintended consequences of lockdowns.","Kishore, N.; Kahn, R.; Martinez, P.

We previously reported an expanded CD14(+) monocyte state, MS1, in patients with bacterial sepsis and validated expansion of this cell subpopulation in publicly available transcriptomics data. Here, using published datasets, we show that the gene expression program associated with MS1 correlated with sepsis severity and was up-regulated in monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19. To examine the ontogeny and function of MS1 cells, we developed a cellular model for inducing CD14(+) MS1 monocytes from healthy bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). We found that plasma from patients with bacterial sepsis or COVID-19 induced myelopoiesis in HSPCs in vitro and expression of the MS1 gene program in monocytes and neutrophils that differentiated from these HSPCs. Furthermore, we found that plasma concentrations of IL-6, and to a lesser extent IL-10, correlated with increased myeloid cell output from HSPCs in vitro and enhanced expression of the MS1 gene program. We validated the requirement for these two cytokines to induce the MS1 gene program through CRISPR-Cas9 editing of their receptors in HSPCs.

This multi-stage estimation of the model parameters offers a better model fit compared to the whole period analysis and shows how the COVID-19’s infection patterns change over time, primarily depending on the effectiveness of the public health authority’s non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). METHODS: This paper uses the SEIR(D) compartment model to simulate and estimate the parameters for three distinctive stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in Korea, using a manually compiled COVID-19 epidemic dataset for the period between 18 February 2020 and 08 February 2021. The paper identifies three major stages of the COVID-19 epidemic, conducts multi-stage estimations of the SEIR(D) model parameters, and carefully infers context-dependent meaning of the estimation results to help better understand the unique patterns of the transmission of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in each stage. RESULTS: The original SIR compartment model may produce a poor and even misleading estimation result if it is used to cover the entire period of the epidemic. However, if we use the model carefully in distinctive stages of the COVID-19 epidemic, we can find useful insights into the nature of the transmission of the novel coronavirus and the relative effectiveness of the government’s non-pharmaceutical interventions over time.

This constituted the first study to report on the variability in physicochemical properties of β-glucans extracts from the same edible mushroom Lentinus edodes on reduction of these pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Specifically, the impact on the immunomodulatory and cytoprotective properties of our novel ‘in house’ (IH-Lentinan, IHL) and a commercial (Carbosynth-Lentinan, CL) Lentinan extract were investigated using in vitro models of lung injury and macrophage phagocytosis. CL comprised higher amounts of α-glucans and correspondingly less β-glucans. The two lentinan extracts demonstrated varying immunomodulatory activities. Both Lentinan extracts reduced cytokine induced NF-κB activation in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells, with the IHL extract proving more effective at lower doses. In contract, in activated THP-1 derived macrophages, the CL extract more effectively attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-8, IL-2, IL-6, IL-22) as well as TGF-β and IL-10. The CL extract attenuated oxidative stress induced early apoptosis, while the IHL extract attenuated late apoptosis.

However, there are evidences of a very high proportion of asymptomatic patients. In this situation, in order to estimate the real number of infected (and to estimate the lethality rate), it should be necessary to run a properly designed sample survey through which it would be possible to calculate the probability of inclusion and hence draw sound probabilistic inference. Unfortunately, the survey run by the Italian Statistical Institute encountered many field difficulties. Some researchers proposed estimates of the total prevalence based on various approaches, including epidemiologic models, time series and the analysis of data collected in countries that faced the epidemic in earlier time. In this paper, we propose to estimate the prevalence of Covid-19 in Italy by reweighting the available official data published by the Istituto Superiore di Sanità so as to obtain a more representative sample of the Italian population. Reweighting is a procedure commonly used to artificially modify the sample composition so as to obtain a distribution which is more similar to the population. In this paper, we will use post-stratification of the official data, in order to derive the weights necessary for reweighting the sample results, using age and gender as post-stratification variables, thus obtaining more reliable estimation of prevalence and lethality. Specifically, for Italy, we obtain a prevalence of 9%. The proposed methodology represents a reasonable approximation while waiting for more reliable data obtained with a properly designed national sample survey and that it could be further improved if more data were made available.","Bassi, F.; Arbia, G.; Falorsi, P.

Corresponding to mRNA, ACE2 activity was highest in the ileum and mouse kidney but weak in the rat kidney, which was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Contrary to mRNA, we found weak activity in the lung of both species. Our data demonstrate a tissue- and species-specific pattern for ACE2 under physiological conditions.","Gembardt, Florian; Sterner-Kock, Anja; Imboden, Hans; Spalteholz, Matthias; Reibitz, Franziska; Schultheiss, Heinz-Peter; Siems, Wolf-Eberhard; Walther, Thomas",Peptides,461,1

The virus caused several outbreaks in the Asia-Pacific region during the past two decades and has been considered a significant public health problem in the post-poliovirus eradication era. Unlike poliovirus, there is no effective vaccine or approved antivirals against EV71. To explore anti-EV71 agents therefore is of vital importance. Several strategies have been employed to develop antivirals based on the molecular characteristics of the virus. Among these, some small molecules that were developed against human rhinoviruses and poliovirus are under evaluation. In this review, we discuss the recent development of such small molecules against EV71, known drug resistance and possible solutions to it, and animal models for evaluating the efficacy of these antivirals. Although further investigation is required for clinical applications of the existing candidates, the molecular mechanisms revealed for the inhibition of EV71 replication can be used for designing new molecules against this virus in the future.","Kuo, Rei-Lin; Shih, Shin-Ru",Virol J,461,16

We examine the relationship between BMI category and consideration set—the products the individual considers before making a final choice—in an online hypothetical shopping experiment. Specifically, we focus on the healthiness of the consideration set the individual selected. Secondly, we examined the interaction of a health prompt (versus a no-prompt control) with BMI category on the healthiness of the consideration set. We used linear probability models to document the relationship between weight status and consideration set, between prompt and consideration set, and the effect of the interaction between prompt and weight status on consideration set. We found that (1) obese individuals are 10% less likely to shop from a consideration set that includes the healthy options, (2) viewing the prompt increased the probability of choosing a healthy consideration set by 9%, and (3) exposure to the prompt affected individuals in different BMI categories equally. While obese individuals are more likely to ignore healthier product options, a health-focused prompt increases consideration of healthy options across all BMI categories.","Gustafson, Christopher R.; Arslain, Kristina; Rose, Devin J.",Nutrients,461,16

This study aimed to describe the clinical and laboratory features of 20 children with COVID-19 who had underlying malignancies in an Iranian referral pediatrics hospital. METHODS All children under 15-year-old of age with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and presence of an underlying malignancy were included in the study. RESULTS In this study, among 20 patients, 11 were male (55%). The mean age of the patients was 6.0 ± 4.1 years. Twelve patients (60%) had acute lymphocytic leukemia, two had acute myeloid leukemia (10%), and six had solid organ tumors (30%). The most common symptoms were fever (65%) and cough (65%). We reported severe pneumonia in seven hospitalized patients (35%) and three patients (20%) required intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation. Procalcitonin was normal in 73% of the cases (11 out of 15), but it was highly elevated in four cases (27%). Five patients (25%) had positive blood cultures and a mortality of 20% was reported. CONCLUSIONS This is the largest study on SARS-CoV-2 infected pediatric patients with underlying malignancies in Iran. Since the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and even death in children with malignancy, either in the hospital or community setting during the pandemic is high, special precautions to reduce the risk of transmission are highly suggested.","Navaeian, Amene; Mahmoudi, Shima; Pourakbari, Babak; Bakhtiari, Maryam; Khodabandeh, Mahmoud; Abdolsalehi, Mohammad Reza; Sharari, Alieh Safari; Mamishi, Setareh",Journal of basic and clinical physiology and pharmacology,461,24

As previously observed with other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 deeply dysregulate the immune system eliciting respiratory failure and a state of systemic hyperinflammation in severely ill individuals. Immunotherapy is often used to downgrade the detrimental effects of the disease sustained by high-level of cytokines. Those treatments, however, are known to undermine patients’ ability to contain tuberculosis (TB) infection. This study aims to describe interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) results in severe COVID-19 patients eligible for immunosuppressive treatment. Aggregate data were gathered from five hospitals in Milan, Italy, from March 1 to May 15, 2020 and retrospectively analyses. Results were summarized using absolute frequencies and percentages and compared using a two-sided Chi-squared test. Overall, 462 COVID-19 patients were eligible for immunosuppressive therapy, among which 335 were tested using IGRA testing. More than one-third of them (122/335; 36.4%) had an indeterminate IGRA result because of insufficient immune response to mitogen control, 19 (5.7%) tested positive and 194 (57.9) negative. The majority of patients with lymphocytopenia (i.e., total lymphocyte count [TLC] below 1000 cells/mm(3)) had indeterminate IGRAs (81/155; 52.3%). The proportion becomes even higher in patients with severe lymphocytopenia (i.e., TLC<500 cells/mm(3)) (36/57; 63%). Our results suggest a possible negative impact of COVID-19 related immune dysregulation on TB infection assessment and management. Close monitoring of individuals with or without retesting of individuals with indeterminate IGRAs and further basic science investigations should to be sought to better comprehend their implication on TB epidemiology.","Torre, Alessandro; Aliberti, Stefano; Castellotti, Paola; Cirillo, Daniela Maria; Grisolia, Antonella; Mangioni, Davide; Marchetti, Giulia; Rossotti, Roberto; Santus, Pierachille; Besozzi, Giorgio; Villa, Simone; Codecasa, Luigi Ruffo",Respir Med,461,16

DESIGN: Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they had cohort, case–control or case series designs and provided sufficient details on clinical symptoms, laboratory outcomes and asymptomatic patients. SETTING: PubMed, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Wanfang, China Science and Technology Journal Database and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were electronically searched to identify related studies published between 1 January 2020 and 16 March 2020. Three reviewers independently examined the literature, extracted relevant data and assessed the risk of publication bias before including the studies in the meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS: The confirmed cases of COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 55 unique retrospective studies involving 8697 patients with COVID-19 were identified. Meta-analysis showed that a higher proportion of infected patients were male (53.3%), and the two major symptoms observed were fever (78.4%) and cough (58.3%). Other common symptoms included fatigue (34%), myalgia (21.9%), expectoration (23.7%), anorexia (22.9%), chest tightness (22.9%) and dyspnoea (20.6%). Minor symptoms included nausea and vomiting (6.6%), diarrhoea (8.2%), headache (11.3%), pharyngalgia (11.6%), shivering (15.2%) and rhinorrhea (7.3%). About 5.4% of the patients were asymptomatic. Most patients showed normal leucocyte counts (64.7%) and elevated C reactive protein levels (65.9%). Lymphopaenia was observed in about 47.6% of the infected patients, along with abnormal levels of myocardial enzymes (49.4%) and liver function (26.4%). Other findings included leucopenia (23.5%), elevated D-dimer (20.4%), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (20.4%), leucocytosis (9.9%), elevated procalcitonin (16.7%) and abnormal renal function (10.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The most commonly experienced symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were fever and cough. Myalgia, anorexia, chest tightness and dyspnoea were found in some patients. A relatively small percentage of patients were asymptomatic and could act as carriers of the disease. Most patients showed normal leucocyte counts, elevated levels of C reactive protein and lymphopaenia, confirming the viral origin of the disease.","Zhu, Jieyun; Zhong, Zhimei; Ji, Pan; Li, Hongyuan; Li, Bocheng; Pang, Jielong; Zhang, Jianfeng; Zhao, Chunling",Fam Med Community Health,461,26

We, therefore, aimed to systematically assess the long-term health status of samples of hospitalized and non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals from three regions in Germany. METHODS: The present paper describes the COVIDOM-study within the population-based cohort platform (POP) which has been established under the auspices of the NAPKON infrastructure (German National Pandemic Cohort Network) of the national Network University Medicine (NUM). Comprehensive health assessments among SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals are conducted at least 6 months after the acute infection at the study sites Kiel, Würzburg and Berlin. Potential participants were identified and contacted via the local public health authorities, irrespective of the severity of the initial infection. A harmonized examination protocol has been implemented, consisting of detailed assessments of medical history, physical examinations, and the collection of multiple biosamples (e.g., serum, plasma, saliva, urine) for future analyses. In addition, patient-reported perception of the impact of local pandemic-related measures and infection on quality-of-life are obtained. RESULTS: As of July 2021, in total 6813 individuals infected in 2020 have been invited into the COVIDOM-study. Of these, about 36% wished to participate and 1295 have already been examined at least once. CONCLUSION: NAPKON-POP COVIDOM-study complements other Long COVID studies assessing the long-term consequences of an infection with SARS-CoV-2 by providing detailed health data of population-based samples, including individuals with various degrees of disease severity.

In the absence of an effective treatment in early 2020, different drugs with unknown effectiveness, including antimalarial hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), with or without concurrent administration with azithromycin (AZM), have been tested for treating COVID-19 patients with developed pneumonia. However, the efficacy and safety of HCQ and/or AZM have been questioned by recent clinical reports. Direct effects of these drugs on the human heart remain very poorly defined. To better understand the mechanisms of action of HCQ +/− AZM, we employed bioengineered human ventricular cardiac tissue strip (hvCTS) and anisotropic sheet (hvCAS) assays, made with human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes (hvCMs), which have been designed for measuring cardiac contractility and electrophysiology, respectively. Our hvCTS experiments showed that AZM induced a dose-dependent negative inotropic effect which could be aggravated by HCQ; electrophysiologically, as revealed by the hvCAS platform, AZM prolonged action potentials and induced spiral wave formations. Collectively, our data were consistent with reported clinical risks of HCQ and AZM on QTc prolongation/ventricular arrhythmias and development of heart failure. In conclusion, our study exposed the risks of HCQ/AZM administration while providing mechanistic insights for their toxicity. Our bioengineered human cardiac tissue constructs therefore provide a useful platform for screening cardiac safety and efficacy when developing therapeutics against COVID-19.","Wong, Andy On-Tik; Gurung, Bimal; Wong, Wing Sum; Mak, Suet Yee; Tse, Wan Wai; Li, Chloe M.; Lieu, Deborah K.; Costa, Kevin D.; Li, Ronald A.; Hajjar, Roger J.",J Mol Cell Cardiol,461,5

Moreover, in some situations, patients may develop severe complications as pneumonia, and sepsis, leading to death. This study aims to investigate the characteristic features of COVID-19 patients based on their medical condition prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study took place between the 1st of April 2020 and the 31(st) of June 2020 in Prince Hamzah Hospital, Jordan. Patients were diagnosed by the Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)–PCR Diagnostic Panel, either through screening or for those who developed symptoms. During this period, patients who tested positive for COVID 19 were admitted to the hospital regardless of their symptoms according to the local government health policies. A total of 508 Patients were involved and divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of chronic illnesses prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 371 patients were medically free (220 males and 151 females). Among them, 153 patients were symptomatic (41.2%), with an average hospitalization of 18 days. Generalized malaise, dry cough, and fever were the most common reported symptoms (51%, 45.8%, and 41.8%, respectively). On the other hand, the total number of COVID-19 patients with predefined comorbidities was 137 (93 males and 44 females). Among them, 86 patients (62.8%) were symptomatic, with an average duration of admission of 19.3 days. Similar to medically free patients, dry cough, generalized malaise, and fever were the most commonly reported symptoms (50%, 43%, and 38.4%, respectively). There was a statistically significant correlation between the presence of chronic illnesses and the development of symptoms among COVID-19 patients (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Dry cough, generalized malaise, and fever were the most commonly reported symptoms among our patients regardless of their medical condition. The average duration of hospitalization in medically free patients was less than patients with comorbidities, and it was less among asymptomatic compared to symptomatic patients. More than half of our COVID-19 patients were male and asymptomatic. A significant correlation between patients' medical condition and the possibility of developing symptoms in response to COVID-19 was identified.","Al-Balas, Mahmoud; Al-Balas, Hasan I.; Alqassieh, Rami; Al-Balas, Hamzeh; Khamees, Almu'atasim; Al-Balas, Rahaf; Al-Balas, Samir",Open Respir Med J,461,26

A recent study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified that US counties with high social vulnerability according to metrics such as poverty, unemployment, low income, and no high school diploma, have significantly lower rates of vaccination compared to the national average1. Here, we build upon this analysis to consider associations between county-level vaccination rates and 68 different demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental factors for 1,510 American counties with over 228 million individuals for which vaccination data was also available. Our analysis reveals that counties with high levels of uninsured individuals have significantly lower COVID-19 vaccination rates (Spearman correlation: -0.264), despite the fact that the CDC has mandated that all COVID-19 vaccines are free and cannot be denied to anyone based upon health insurance coverage or immigration status. Furthermore, we find that the counties with high levels of uninsured individuals tend to have the highest COVID-19 incidence rates in March 2021 relative to December 2020 (Spearman correlation: 0.388). Among the 68 factors analyzed, insurance coverage is the only factor which is highly correlated with both vaccination rate and change in COVID-19 incidence during the vaccination period (|Spearman correlation| > 0.25). We also find that counties with higher percentages of Black and Hispanic individuals have significantly lower vaccination rates (Spearman correlations: -0.128, -0.136) and lesser declines of COVID-incidence rates (Spearman correlations: 0.334, 0.330) during the vaccination period. Surprisingly however, after controlling for race, we find that the association between lack of insurance coverage and vaccination rate as well as COVID-19 incidence rates is largely driven by counties with a majority white population. Among the counties with high proportions of white residents (top 10% decile), the association between insurance coverage and vaccination rate is significant (Spearman correlation: -0.210, p-value: 0.002), but among counties with low proportions of white residents (bottom 10% decile) this association is not significant (Spearman correlation: 0.072, p-value: 0.088). Taken together, this study highlights the fact that intricate socioeconomic factors are correlated not just to COVID-19 vaccination rates, but also to COVID-19 incidence fluctuations, underscoring the need to improve COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in marginalized communities. The strong positive correlation between low levels of health insurance coverage and low vaccination rates is particularly concerning, and calls for improved public health messaging to emphasize the fact that health insurance is not required to be eligible for any of the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines in the United States.","Lindemer, E.; Choudhary, M.; Donadio, G.; Pawlowski, C.; Soundararajan, V.",,461,16

We sought to determine the change in rates and types of admissions to tertiary and specialty care hospitals in the COVID-19 era compared with pre-COVID-19 era. Methods Acute care admissions to the largest tertiary care referral hospital, designated national referral centers for cardiac, cancer and maternity hospital in the State of Qatar during March 2020 (COVID-19 era) and January 2020 and March 2019 (pre-COVID-19 era) were compared. We calculated total admissions, and admissions for eight specific acute care conditions, in-hospital mortality rate and length of stay at each hospital. Results A total of 18,889 hospital admissions were recorded. A sharp decline ranging from 9%-75% was observed in overall admissions. A decline in both elective and non-elective surgeries was observed. A decline of 9%-58% was observed in admissions for acute appendicitis, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, bone fractures, cancer and live births, while an increase in admissions due to respiratory tract infections was observed. Overall length of stay was shorter in the COVID-19 period possibly suggesting lesser overall disease severity, with no significant change in in-hospital mortality. Unadjusted mortality rate for Qatar showed marginal increase in the COVID-19 period. Conclusions We observed a sharp decline in acute care hospital admissions, with a significant decline in admissions due to seven out of eight acute care conditions. This decline was associated with a shorter length of stay, but not associated with a change in in-hospital mortality rate.","Butt, Adeel A.; Kartha, Anand B.; Masoodi, Naseer A.; Azad, Aftab Mohammad; Asaad, Nidal Ahmad; Alhomsi, Mohamad Ussama; Saleh, Huda A.H.; Bertollini, Roberto; Abou-Samra, Abdul-Badi",Public Health,461,16

Taking into account parameters associated to the population of each city and the mobility among them, the optimal control framework suggests the level and duration of protective measures that must be implemented to ensure that the number of infected individuals is within a range that avoids the collapse of the health care system. Compared against other mitigation measures that are implemented simultaneously and in equal strength across cities our method has three major particularities when: Accounts for city commute and health infrastructure: It takes into account the daily commute among cities to estimate the dynamics of infected people while keeping the number of infected people within a desired level at each city avoiding the collapse of its health care system. City-specific control: It allows for orchestrating the control measures among cities so as to prevent all cities to face the same level control. The model tends to induce alternation between periods of stricter controls and periods of a more normal life in each city and among the cities. Flexible scenarios: It is flexible enough to allow for simulating the impact of particular actions. For example, one can simulate the how the control all cities change when the number of care beds increases in specific places. Therefore, our method creates an automatic dance adjusting mitigation levels within cities and alternating among cities as suggested in~cite{Pue2020}. This automatic dance may help the city economy and orchestration of resources. We provide case studies using the major cities of the state of Sao Paulo given by using estimates on the daily mobility among the cities their health care system capacity. We use official data in our case studies. However, sub-notification of infected people in Brazil is notoriously high. Hence the case study should not be considered as a real world policy suggestion. It high sub-notification is taken into account, the optimal control algorithm will suggest stricter mitigation measures, as also shown in the case studies. Surprisingly, the total duration of the protocol for the state is barely affected by the sub-notification, but the severity of such protocols is strengthened. This stresses a twofold implication, first, the protocol depends on high-quality data and, second, such optimal and orchestrated protocol is robust and can be adjusted to the demand.","Silva, P. J.

These strains seem to be more easily transmissible than other variants, which may lead to more cases and more deaths. Currently, there are many vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 available in the market but without full clinical data beside. Despite the existence of these vaccines, the numbers of outpatients are still increasing in many countries around the world, and the reliability of these vaccines still remains elusive. It is well known that trace element deficiencies increase the individual susceptibility to immune dysfunction and lead to global health problem. In this context, improving the immune defense system to combats this pandemic is absolutely necessary. The purpose of this review is to establish the probable relation between trace elements supplementation and COVID-19. MAIN BODY: Several clinical studies confirmed that Cu, Se, and Zn insufficiencies alter the immune system and increase the vulnerability to viral infections. Based on antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects of these micronutrients, it seems logical that dietary supplementations of these components might enhance human immune system and lower the graveness of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: Based on available data, we hypothesize that the clinical use of some essential trace element supplementations such as copper, selenium, and zinc might be a preventive and promising option to enhance human immunity against the new pandemic COVID-19 and its new strains.

Although reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing is the reference standard method to identify patients with COVID-19 infection, chest radiography and CT play a vital role in the detection and management of these patients. Prediction models for COVID-19 imaging are rapidly being developed to support medical decision making. However, inadequate availability of a diverse annotated data set has limited the performance and generalizability of existing models. To address this unmet need, the RSNA and Society of Thoracic Radiology collaborated to develop the RSNA International COVID-19 Open Radiology Database (RICORD). This database is the first multi-institutional, multinational, expert-annotated COVID-19 imaging data set. It is made freely available to the machine learning community as a research and educational resource for COVID-19 chest imaging. Pixel-level volumetric segmentation with clinical annotations was performed by thoracic radiology subspecialists for all COVID-19–positive thoracic CT scans. The labeling schema was coordinated with other international consensus panels and COVID-19 data annotation efforts, the European Society of Medical Imaging Informatics, the American College of Radiology, and the American Association of Physicists in Medicine. Study-level COVID-19 classification labels for chest radiographs were annotated by three radiologists, with majority vote adjudication by board-certified radiologists. RICORD consists of 240 thoracic CT scans and 1000 chest radiographs contributed from four international sites. It is anticipated that RICORD will ideally lead to prediction models that can demonstrate sustained performance across populations and health care systems. © RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Vitamin D is a known risk factor for COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association of prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and mean vitamin D level with COVID-19 infection and mortality in Asia, predicting with other confounding factors such as median age, obesity, and diabetes. METHODS: COVID-19 infections and mortalities among the Asian countries were retrieved from the Worldometer website. Information on prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and mean vitamin D values in each Asian country was retrieved through literature searching on PubMed® and Google scholar. The associations between COVID-19 infections and mortalities with prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and mean vitamin D level were explored with correlation coefficients. As a predictive analysis, multiple linear regression was carried out with all confounders. RESULTS: Positive correlations were observed for prevalence of vitamin D deficiency with COVID-19 infections (r = 0.55; p = 0.01; R(2) = 0.31) and mortalities (r = 0.50; p = 0.01; R(2) = 0.25). Moreover, the associations for the COVID-19 infections and mortalities improved to r = 0.76 (p = 0.002; R(2) = 0.58) and r = 0.65 (p = 0.03; R(2) = 0.42) respectively after predicting with confounding factors. Similarly, mean vitamin D level had a significant negative correlation with COVID-19 infections (r = −0.77; p = 0.04; R(2) = 0.59) and mortalities (r = −0.80; p = 0.03; R(2) = 0.63) when combining with confounders. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is significantly positively associated whereas the mean vitamin D level is significantly negatively associated with both infection and mortality rate of COVID-19 among Asian countries upon predicting with all confounders.","Jayawardena, Ranil; Jeyakumar, Dhanushya T.; Francis, Tormalli V.; Misra, Anoop",Diabetes Metab Syndr,461,29

The high pulmonary tropism and contagiousness of the virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), have stimulated new approaches to combat its widespread diffusion. In developing new pharmacological strategies, the chemical characteristic of volatility can add therapeutic value to the hypothetical drug candidate. Volatile molecules are characterized by a high vapor pressure and are consequently easily exhaled by the lungs after ingestion. This feature could be exploited from a pharmacological point of view, reaching the site of action in an uncommon way but allowing for drug delivery. In this way, a hypothetical molecule for COVID‐19 should have a balance between its lung exhalation characteristics and both antiviral and anti‐inflammatory pharmacological action. Here, the feasibility, advantages, and disadvantages of a therapy based on oral administration of possible volatile drugs for COVID‐19 will be discussed. Both aerosolized antiviral therapy and oral intake of volatile molecules are briefly reviewed, and an evaluation of 1,8‐cineole is provided in view of a possible clinical use and also for asymptomatic COVID‐19.","Colalto, Cristiano",Drug Dev Res,461,1

Concern for viral transmission necessitates the investigation of otologic procedures that use high-speed drilling instruments, including mastoidectomy, which we hypothesized to be an aerosol-generating procedure. METHODS: Mastoidectomy with a high-speed drill was simulated using fresh-frozen cadaveric heads with fluorescein solution injected into the mastoid air cells. Specimens were drilled for 1-minute durations in test conditions with and without a microscope. A barrier drape was fashioned from a commercially available drape (the OtoTent). Dispersed particulate matter was quantified in segments of an octagonal test grid measuring 60 cm in radius. RESULTS: Drilling without a microscope dispersed fluorescent particles 360 degrees, with the areas of highest density in quadrants near the surgeon and close to the surgical site. Using a microscope or varying irrigation rates did not significantly reduce particle density or percent surface area with particulate. Using the OtoTent significantly reduced particle density and percent surface area with particulate across the segments of the test grid beyond 30 cm (which marked the boundary of the OtoTent) compared with the microscope only and no microscope test conditions (Kruskall–Wallis test, p = 0.0066). CONCLUSIONS: Mastoidectomy with a high-speed drill is an aerosol-generating procedure, a designation that connotes the potential high risk of viral transmission and need for higher levels of personal protective equipment. A simple barrier drape significantly reduced particulate dispersion in this study and could be an effective mitigation strategy in addition to appropriate personal protective equipment.","Chen, Jenny X.; Workman, Alan D.; Chari, Divya A.; Jung, David H.; Kozin, Elliott D.; Lee, Daniel J.; Welling, D.

The feasibility of rapid clinical-grade manufacturing of virus-specific T cells from convalescent donors has not been demonstrated for this or prior pandemics. Methods One unit of whole blood was collected from each convalescent donor following standard blood bank practices. After the plasma was separated and stored separately, the leukocytes were stimulated using overlapping peptides of SARS-CoV-2, covering the immunodominant sequence domains of the S protein and the complete sequence of the N and M proteins. Thereafter, functionally reactive cells were enriched overnight using an automated device capturing IFN{gamma}-secreting cells. Findings From 1x10[9] leukocytes, 0.56 to 1.16x10[6] IFN{gamma}+ T cells were produced from each of the first two donors. Most of the T cells (64% to 71%) were IFN{gamma}+, with preferential enrichment of CD56+ T cells, effector memory T cells, and effector memory RA+ T cells. TCRV{beta} spectratyping revealed oligoclonal distribution, with over-representation of subfamilies including V{beta}3, V{beta}16 and V{beta}17. With just two donors, the probability that a recipient in the same ethnic group would share at least one donor HLA allele or one haplotype could be as high as >90% and >30%, respectively. Interpretations This study is limited by small number of donors and absence of recipient data; however, crucial first proof-of-principle data are provided demonstrating the feasibility of clinical-grade production of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells for urgent clinical use, conceivably with plasma therapy concurrently. Our data showing that virus-specific T cells can be detected easily after brief stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 specific peptides suggest that a parallel diagnostic assay can be developed alongside serology testing.","Leung, W.; Soh, T.

DESIGN: Retrospective single-center study. SETTING: ICUs at a large academic medical center in the United States. PATIENTS: Thirty-eight adult critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and refractory hypoxemia treated with either inhaled epoprostenol or inhaled nitric oxide for at least 1 hour between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Electronic chart review. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 93 patients screened, 38 were included in the analysis, with mild (4, 10.5%), moderate (24, 63.2%), or severe (10, 26.3%), with acute respiratory distress syndrome. All patients were initiated on inhaled epoprostenol as the initial pulmonary vasodilator and the median time from intubation to initiation was 137 hours (68–228 h). The median change in Pao(2)/Fio(2) was 0 (–12.8 to 31.6) immediately following administration of inhaled epoprostenol. Sixteen patients were classified as responders (increase Pao(2)/Fio(2) > 10%) to inhaled epoprostenol, with a median increase in Pao(2)/Fio(2) of 34.1 (24.3–53.9). The mean change in Pao(2) and Spo(2) was –0.55 ± 41.8 and –0.6 ± 4.7, respectively. Eleven patients transitioned to inhaled nitric oxide with a median change of 11 (3.6–24.8) in Pao(2)/Fio(2). A logistic regression analysis did not identify any differences in outcomes or characteristics between the responders and the nonresponders. Minimal adverse events were seen in patients who received either inhaled epoprostenol or inhaled nitric oxide. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the initiation of inhaled epoprostenol and inhaled nitric oxide in patients with refractory hypoxemia secondary to coronavirus disease 2019, on average, did not produce significant increases in oxygenation metrics. However, a group of patients had significant improvement with inhaled epoprostenol and inhaled nitric oxide.

The number of newly-diagnosed cases and the number HIV-related deaths have increased each year since 2004, coinciding with a massive scale-up of both HIV testing and antiretroviral therapy initiation. The proportion of cases diagnosed later in their disease progression has remained constant. SUMMARY: The initial outbreaks of HIV across China were identified quickly and the overall trends have been monitored. While the HIV epidemic among PWID has been well managed, the growing HIV epidemic via sexual contact has grown more complex and even more difficult to control.","Wu, Zunyou; Chen, Junfang; Scott, Sarah Robbins; McGoogan, Jennifer M.",Curr HIV/AIDS Rep,461,18

The U.S. does not currently have a federal paid leave policy, and unpaid leave—guaranteed by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993—is all that is available to the majority of workers. In this study, we examine the content of local television news as representations of, and potential influence on, paid leave policy agendas. To do so, we analyze the extent to which local television news coverage describes the problem of lack of employment leave, and whether coverage highlights public policy as a solution. We use data from local television stations affiliated with the four major networks (ABC, NBC, CBS, and FOX) in all 210 media markets in the U.S. during a period pre-pandemic, from October 2018 until July 2019. We find that 64% of local television news coverage related to paid leave discussed the issue in the context of public policy. Coverage more often cited early-stage policy actions such as a policy idea - reflected in 40% of stories discussing stages of public policymaking – or the introduction of a bill – detailed in 22% of these stories. This coverage aligns with actual policy activity at the state-level during the same time period. News coverage infrequently included elements that could shape public understanding of paid leave as a population health issue, such as including health-related sources of providers or researchers. Policymakers, advocates, and researchers looking to advance public support for paid leave should consider efforts to use local television news as a vehicle to present health and policy-relevant information to broad segments of the public and set the agenda for policy reform.","Tait, Margaret; Bogucki, Colleen; Baum, Laura; Franklin Fowler, Erika; Niederdeppe, Jeff; Gollust, Sarah",SSM Popul Health,461,30

Surgical smoke can act as a carrier for tissue particles, viruses, and bacteria. To quantify airborne transmission from a physical point of view, we consider surgical smoke produced by thermal destruction of tissue during the use of electrosurgical instruments as a marker of airborne particle diffusion-transportation. Surgical smoke plumes are also known to be dangerous for human health, especially to surgical staff who receive long-term exposure over the years. There are limited quantified metrics reported on long-term effects of surgical smoke on staff's health. The purpose of this paper is to provide a mathematical framework and experimental protocol to assess the transport and diffusion of hazardous airborne particles in every large operating room suite. Measurements from a network of air quality sensors gathered during a clinical study provide validation for the main part of the model. Overall, the model estimates staff exposure to airborne contamination from surgical smoke and biological material. To address the clinical implication over a long period of time, the systems approach is built upon previous work on multi-scale modeling of surgical flow in a large operating room suite and takes into account human behavior factors.","Garbey, M.; Joerger, G.; Furr, S.",,461,1

When people are physically isolated and distant from each other, technology may play a fundamental role by enabling social connection and reducing feelings of loneliness caused by this prolonged social isolation. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many mental health services worldwide have had to shift their routine face-to-face outpatient appointments to remote telepsychiatry encounters. The increased pressure on mental health services highlights the importance of community-led health-promotion interventions, which can contribute to preventing mental illness or their relapses, and to reduce the burden on health services. Patients with psychosis are particularly socially isolated, have sedentary lifestyles, and commonly face stigma and discrimination from the general population. At the same time, patients with psychosis value technology, are interested in, use and own smart-phones to digitally connect, and are satisfied with their use. Thus, among psychosocial interventions, a helpful resource may be “Phone Pal,” a complex intervention which facilitates remote communication between volunteers and socially isolated patients with psychosis through different smart-phone tools. While “Phone Pal” has been originally developed for people with psychosis, it may also be useful to the wider population, helping to overcome the social isolation caused by physical distancing, particularly in these times of widespread isolation. “Phone Pal” may be a potential public health resource for society, providing important support to those that may need it the most, and possibly benefit most from it.","Pinto da Costa, Mariana",Eur Psychiatry,461,33

In this study, we focused on siblings of children with ASD to reveal their adjustment to their daily life. In addition, we examined their caregivers’ stress. METHODS: An online Qualtrics survey was given to caregivers of children with ASD on February, 2021 at Thomas Jefferson University in the United States. First, we assessed the severity of children with ASD. In addition, we examined how their neurotypical siblings adjusted to their daily life using the validated Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Moreover, we analyzed caregivers’ stress and their socioeconomic status. RESULTS: Fifteen caregivers responded to the survey. 42% of children with ASD had behavioral issues beforehand, 80% of which showed worse behaviors during this pandemic. Siblings of children with ASD showed higher scores of difficulties in adapting to new routines during COVID-19. Some caregivers lost their jobs and caregivers of those with behavioral issues reported stress levels that were 4.4 points higher on the scale. CONCLUSIONS: Siblings of children with ASD and their caregivers are facing difficulties in their daily life during this pandemic.

This study aimed to identify potential risk factors for mortality in older patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) on admission, which may help identify those with poor prognosis at an early stage. DESIGN: Retrospective case‐control. SETTING: Fever ward of Sino‐French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 60 years or older with COVID‐19 (n = 244) were included, of whom 123 were discharged and 121 died in hospital. MEASUREMENTS: Data retrieved from electronic medical records regarding symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings on admission, and final outcomes of all older patients with COVID‐19, were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore risk factors for death. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that several clinical characteristics and laboratory variables were significantly different (ie, P < .05) between discharged and deceased patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that lymphocyte (LYM) count (odds ratio [OR] = 0.009; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.001‐0.138; P = .001) and older age (OR = 1.122; 95% CI = 1.007‐1.249; P = .037) were independently associated with hospital mortality. White blood cell count was also an important risk factor (P = .052). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the logistic regression model was 0.913. Risk factors for in‐hospital death were similar between older men and women. CONCLUSION: Older age and lower LYM count on admission were associated with death in hospitalized COVID‐19 patients. Stringent monitoring and early intervention are needed to reduce mortality in these patients.","Sun, Haiying; Ning, Ruoqi; Tao, Yu; Yu, Chong; Deng, Xiaoyan; Zhao, Caili; Meng, Silu; Tang, Fangxu; Xu, Dong",J Am Geriatr Soc,461,33

Iran was among the first countries with a major outbreak outside China. Methods We constructed a globally representative sample of 802 genomes, including 46 samples from patients inside or with a travel history to Iran. We then performed a phylogenetic analysis to identify clades related to samples from Iran and estimated the start of the epidemic and early doubling times in cases. We leveraged air travel data from 36 exported cases of COVID-19 to estimate the point-prevalence and the basic reproductive number across the country. We also analysed the province-level all-cause mortality data during winter and spring 2020 to estimate under-reporting of COVID-19-related deaths. Finally, we use this information in an SEIR model to reconstruct the early outbreak dynamics and assess the effectiveness of intervention measures in Iran. Results By identifying the most basal clade that contained genomes from Iran, our phylogenetic analysis showed that the age of the root is placed on 2019-12-21 (95 % HPD: 2019-09-07 – 2020-02-14). This date coincides with our estimated epidemic start date on 2019-12-25 (95 %CI: 2019-12-11 – 2020-02-24) based air travel data from exported cases with an early doubling time of 4.0 (95 %CI: 1.4–6.7) days in cases. Our analysis of all-cause mortality showed 21.9 (95 % CI: 16.7–27.2) thousand excess deaths by the end of summer. Our model forecasted the second epidemic peak and suggested that by 2020-08-31 a total of 15.0 (95 %CI: 4.9–25.0) million individuals recovered from the disease across the country. Conclusion These findings have profound implications for assessing the stage of the epidemic in Iran despite significant levels of under-reporting. Moreover, the results shed light on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions in Iran and central Asia. They also suggest that in the absence of border screening, there is a high risk of introduction from travellers from areas with active outbreaks. Finally, they show both that well-informed epidemic models are able to forecast episodes of resurgence following a relaxation of interventions, and that NPIs are key to controlling ongoing epidemics.","Ghafari, Mahan; Hejazi, Bardia; Karshenas, Arman; Dascalu, Stefan; Kadvidar, Alireza; Khosravi, Mohammad A.; Abbasalipour, Maryam; Heydari, Majid; Zeinali, Sirous; Ferretti, Luca; Ledda, Alice; Katzourakis, Aris",Epidemics,461,12

Physical degradations often have a significant impact on the vehicle dynamics causing irregular behavior that can jeopardize system safety and mission objectives. The paper presents a novel Behavior Tree-based autonomy architecture that includes a Fault Detection and Isolation Learning-Enabled Component (FDI LEC) with an Assurance Monitor (AM) designed based on Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) techniques. The architecture implements real-time contingency-management functions using fault detection, isolation and reconfiguration subsystems. To improve scalability and reduce the false-positive rate of the FDI LEC, the decision-making logic provides adjustable thresholds for the desired fault coverage and acceptable risk. The paper presents the system architecture with the integrated FDI LEC, as well as the data collection and training approach for the LEC and the AM. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture using a simulated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) based on the BlueROV2 platform.","Stojcsics, Daniel; Boursinos, Dimitrios; Mahadevan, Nagabhushan; Koutsoukos, Xenofon; Karsai, Gabor",Sensors (Basel),461,20

A broad deployment of effective immunization campaigns to achieve population immunity at global scale will depend on the biological and logistical attributes of the vaccine. Here, two adeno-associated viral (AAV)-based vaccine candidates demonstrate potent immunogenicity in mouse and nonhuman primates following a single injection. Peak neutralizing antibody titers remain sustained at 5 months and are complemented by functional memory T-cells responses. The AAVrh32.33 capsid of the AAVCOVID vaccine is an engineered AAV to which no relevant pre-existing immunity exists in humans. Moreover, the vaccine is stable at room temperature for at least one month and is produced at high yields using established commercial manufacturing processes in the gene therapy industry. Thus, this methodology holds as a very promising single dose, thermostable vaccine platform well-suited to address emerging pathogens on a global scale.","Zabaleta, Nerea; Dai, Wenlong; Bhatt, Urja; Chichester, Jessica A; Sanmiguel, Julio; Estelien, Reynette; Michalson, Kristofer T; Diop, Cheikh; Maciorowski, Dawid; Qi, Wenbin; Hudspeth, Elissa; Cucalon, Allison; Dyer, Cecilia D; Pampena, M.
