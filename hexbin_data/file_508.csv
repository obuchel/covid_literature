Due to the notable difference of the Reynolds numbers for the two convection processes, the traditional RANS method can hardly simulate the forced/natural convection flows accurately at the same time. In addition, the large geometric ratio between the main air supply inlet and the whole cabin leads to difficulties in grid generation for the cabin space. An efficient computational model based on the standard k-e model is established to solve these problems. The coefficients in the dissipative equation are modified to compensate the enlarged numerical dissipation caused by coarse grid; meanwhile, the piecewise-defined turbulent viscosity is introduced to combine the forced and natural convection. The modified model is validated by available experimental results in a Boeing 737-200 mock-up. Furthermore, the unsteady characteristic of the aircraft cabin environment is obtained and analyzed. According to the frequency analysis, it turns out that the thermal plume is the main factor of the unsteady fluctuation in cabin.
