3783,Public Perception on Healthcare Services: Evidence from Social Media Platforms in China,2019-04-10,"Social media has been used as data resource in a growing number of health-related research. The objectives of this study were to identify content volume and sentiment polarity of social media records relevant to healthcare services in China. A list of the key words of healthcare services were used to extract data from WeChat and Qzone, between June 2017 and September 2017. The data were put into a corpus, where content analyses were performed using Tencent natural language processing (NLP). The final corpus contained approximately 29 million records. Records on patient safety were the most frequently mentioned topic (approximately 8.73 million, 30.1% of the corpus), with the contents on humanistic care having received the least social media references (0.43 Million, 1.5%). Sentiment analyses showed 36.1%, 16.4%, and 47.4% of positive, neutral, and negative emotions, respectively. The doctor-patient relationship category had the highest proportion of negative contents (74.9%), followed by service efficiency (59.5%), and nursing service (53.0%). Neutral disposition was found to be the highest (30.4%) in the contents on appointment-booking services. This study added evidence to the magnitude and direction of public perceptions on healthcare services in China’s hospital and pointed to the possibility of monitoring healthcare service improvement, using readily available data in social media.","Hu, Guangyu; Han, Xueyan; Zhou, Huixuan; Liu, Yuanli",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6479867/,426
12770,Suicidal Presentations to Emergency Departments in a Large Australian Public Health Service over 10 Years,2020-08-14,"BACKGROUND: The nasal mucosa is sacrificed in conventional endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomies (EDCRs). Some surgeons, however, modify the technique by elevating a mucosal flap prior to creating the osteotomy with the aim of preserving the mucosa. To our knowledge, no clear-cut benefit of a mucosal flap has been established. The aim of this study is to examine the differences in surgical techniques and success rates of EDCRs with and without mucosal flap preservation. METHODS: We carried out a medical record review of all patients who underwent primary EDCR at the Goldschleger Eye Institute from October 2009 to October 2017. The following data were retrieved from the medical database and analyzed: patient demographics (age at diagnosis and gender), medical history, examination findings, surgical details, postoperative success, complications, and follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients who underwent 117 EDCRs participated in the study. Fifty-one patients comprised the group without a mucosal flap and 56 patients comprised the group with mucosal flap preservation. The medical history, presenting complaints, and preoperative examination findings were similar for both groups. The surgical success rate was not significantly different between the groups (82.1% without flap vs. 86.8% with flap, P = 0.478, Chi-square). CONCLUSION: The findings of this comparison of EDCRs with and without mucosal flap preservation in a large patient population revealed no differences in surgical success or complications rates between the two procedures and, therefore, no benefit for adding flap preservation to conventional EDCRs.","Zloto, Ofira; Koval, Tal; Yakirevich, Arkadi; Ben Simon, Guy J; Weissman, Alon; Ben Artsi, Elad; Ben Shoshan, Joseph; Priel, Ayelet",Eye (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468247/,426
13453,Heterogeneous Influences of Social Support on Physical and Mental Health: Evidence from China,2020-09-18,"We examined factors associated with healthcare cost, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and kidney disease quality of life (KDQOL) in hemodialysis patients. We conducted a cross-sectional study on 160 patients from January to April 2019 at a hemodialysis center. Socio-demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters and quality of life (QOL) (using KDQOL-SF-v1.3) were assessed. Monthly healthcare costs were extracted from the hospital information system. The means of healthcare cost, HRQOL, and KDQOL were VND 9.4 ± 1.6 million, VND 45.1 ± 21.9 and VND 51.3 ± 13.0, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, the healthcare cost was higher in patients with a longer hemodialysis vintage (regression coefficient (B): 0.74; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.25; 1.23), comorbidity (B: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.24; 1.31); and lower in those with a higher hematocrit concentration (B: −0.07; 95% CI: −0.13; −0.01). Patients that lived in urban areas (B: 9.08; 95% CI: 2.30; 15.85) had a better HRQOL; those with a comorbidity (B: −14.20; 95% CI: −21.43; −6.97), and with hypoalbuminemia (B: −9.31; 95% CI: −16.58; −2.04) had a poorer HRQOL. Patients with a higher level of education (B: 5.38~6.29) had a better KDQOL; those with a comorbidity had a poorer KDQOL (B: −6.17; 95% CI: −10.49; −1.85). In conclusion, a longer hemodialysis vintage, a comorbidity and a lower hematocrit concentration were associated with higher healthcare costs. Patients who lived in urban areas had a better HRQOL and a higher level of education led to a better KDQOL. Patients with a comorbidity had a lower HRQOL and KDQOL. Malnourished patients had a lower HRQOL.","Doan, Khanh Vuong Diem; Nguyen, Hien Thi Minh; Nguyen, Nhi Thi Hong; Dang, Khoa Cao; Yang, Shwu-Huey; Duong, Tuyen Van",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7559218/,426
13472,The Importance of Genuineness in Public Engagement—An Exploratory Study of Pediatric Communication on Social Media in China,2020-09-27,"(1) Physical activity is one of the most influencing factors in people’ quality of life. Likewise, the costaleros of the Holy Week of Andalusia (Spain) carry out an important effort with high intensity during an extended time without any preparation. This study was the aim of knowing the intensity of the physical activity practiced by the costaleros in relation to their quality of life. (2) A transversal study was carried out with 1057 costaleros in Andalusia (Spain), where 930 were male and 127 female, between the ages of 18–61 years old (31.26 ± 7.60). For this purpose, descriptive, inferential, and correlative analyses were developed. Accelerometers (ActiGraph) were used during the procession to know the intensity of physical activity and the SF-36 test to know the self-perceived state of health and quality of life. (3) The intensity of physical activity practiced by costaleros is moderate, and it is related with their quality of life. In addition, positive associations are found between general health and physical activity. (4) Participants’ quality of life is associated with physical activity and freedom from injury. In addition, the measurement by accelerometry provides real data on the intensity of the effort made.","Ubago-Jiménez, José Luis; Zurita-Ortega, Félix; Puertas-Molero, Pilar; González-Valero, Gabriel",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7582451/,426
14866,How Does Urban Farming Benefit Participants’ Health? A Case Study of Allotments and Experience Farms in Tokyo,2021-01-11,"Background: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has expanding indications for cardiopulmonary resuscitation including severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Despite the adjunct of ECMO for patients with severe ARDS, they often have prolonged mechanical ventilation and are subject to many of its inherent complications. Here, we describe patients who were cannulated for venovenous (VV) ECMO and were taken off positive pressure ventilation. Methods: This is a primary analysis of patients admitted at a tertiary medical center between the dates of August 2014 to January 2020 who were cannulated to ECMO for refractory respiratory failure. We included all patients ≥18 years old. Patients who were extubated or had a tracheostomy and taken off positive pressure while on ECMO were classified as “off positive pressure ventilation (PPV)” and were compared to patients who remained “on PPV” while on ECMO. Primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes were ventilator free days at 30 days and 60 days after ECMO cannulation, time from cannulation to date of first out-of-bed (OOB), and hospital length of stay (LOS). Patient characteristics were derived from routine clinical information in the electronic health record (EHR). Categorical characteristics were compared using chi-square test or Fisher exact test. Continuous characteristics were compared using independent samples t-test or Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test. p-values were reported from all analysis. Results: Sixty-five patients were included in this retrospective analysis. Forty-eight were managed on ECMO with PPV and 17 patients were removed from PPV. Patients removed from PPV had significantly higher lung injury scores prior to cannulation (2.5 ± 0.6 vs. 1.04 ± 0.3; p = 0.031) and non-significantly longer duration of ventilation prior to ECMO (6.1 days ± 2.1 vs. 5.0 days ± 01.1; p = 0.634). One hundred percent (100%) of patients removed from PPV survived to hospital discharge compared to 45% who received PPV throughout their duration of ECMO management (p < 0.001). The mean ventilator free days at day 60 was 15 with PPV and 36 without PPV (p = 0.003). The average duration from cannulation to mobilization (i.e., out-of-bed) was 18 days with PPV and 7 days without PPV (p = 0.015). Conclusions: Patients taken off PPV while on ECMO had a very high likelihood of survival to discharge and were mobilized in half as many days. While this likely reflects patient selection, the benefit of early mobilization is well documented and the approach of extubating while on ECMO warrants further investigation.","Levin, Nicholas M; Ciullo, Anna L; Overton, Sean; Mitchell, Nathan; Skidmore, Chloe R; Tonna, Joseph E",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7827358/,426
15618,Global Population Exposed to Extreme Events in the 150 Most Populated Cities of the World: Implications for Public Health,2021-02-01,"(1) Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with still unknown etiology. Some occupational and environmental risk factors have been suggested, including long-term air pollutant exposure. We carried out a pilot case-control study in order to evaluate ALS risk due to particulate matter with a diameter of ≤10 µm (PM(10)) as a proxy of vehicular traffic exposure. (2) Methods: We recruited ALS patients and controls referred to the Modena Neurology ALS Care Center between 1994 and 2015. Using a geographical information system, we modeled PM(10) concentrations due to traffic emissions at the geocoded residence address at the date of case diagnosis. We computed the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of ALS according to increasing PM(10) exposure, using an unconditional logistic regression model adjusted for age and sex. (3) Results: For the 132 study participants (52 cases and 80 controls), the average of annual median and maximum PM(10) concentrations were 5.2 and 38.6 µg/m(3), respectively. Using fixed cutpoints at 5, 10, and 20 of the annual median PM(10) levels, and compared with exposure <5 µg/m(3), we found no excess ALS risk at 5–10 µg/m(3) (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.39–1.96), 10–20 µg/m(3) (0.94, 95% CI 0.24–3.70), and ≥20 µg/m(3) (0.87, 95% CI 0.05–15.01). Based on maximum PM(10) concentrations, we found a statistically unstable excess ALS risk for subjects exposed at 10–20 µg/m(3) (OR 4.27, 95% CI 0.69–26.51) compared with those exposed <10 µg/m(3). However, risk decreased at 20–50 µg/m(3) (OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.39–5.75) and ≥50 µg/m(3) (1.16, 95% CI 0.28–4.82). ALS risk in increasing tertiles of exposure showed a similar null association, while comparison between the highest and the three lowest quartiles lumped together showed little evidence for an excess risk at PM(10) concentrations (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.50–2.55). After restricting the analysis to subjects with stable residence, we found substantially similar results. (4) Conclusions: In this pilot study, we found limited evidence of an increased ALS risk due to long-term exposure at high PM(10) concentration, though the high statistical imprecision of the risk estimates, due to the small sample size, particularly in some exposure categories, limited our capacity to detect small increases in risk, and further larger studies are needed to assess this relation.","Filippini, Tommaso; Mandrioli, Jessica; Malagoli, Carlotta; Costanzini, Sofia; Cherubini, Andrea; Maffeis, Giuseppe; Vinceti, Marco",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7908475/,426
15623,"Gender and Socioeconomic Status as Factors of Individual Differences in Pre-University Students’ Decision-Making for Careers, with a Focus on Family Influence and Psychosocial Factors",2021-02-02,"We aimed to describe the infectious disease (ID) mortality trends and evaluate age–period–cohort (APC) effects on ID mortality in Korea. Using cause-of-death and census population estimates data from 1983–2017, age-standardized ID mortality trends were investigated by joinpoint regression analysis. The APC effects on ID mortality were estimated using intrinsic estimator models. The age effect showed a J-shaped concave upward curve. Old age, especially ≥70 years, was a critical factor for ID deaths. Similar to the W-shaped period curve, ID mortality rapidly decreased due to economic development and the expansion of health coverage in the 1980s, decelerated with increasing inequality, surged due to the 1997 economic crisis, and has gradually increased since the mid-2000s. The cohort effect showed an inverted U-shape. The increasing cohort effect due to the deterioration of living standards led to a decreasing trend after the independence of Korea. Notwithstanding the slowdown during the 1950–1953 Korean War, educational expansion, economic growth, fertility reduction, and the improvement of ID-related policies might have led to a continued decline among the cohorts born since the 1960s. Diverse socioeconomic events may have influenced ID mortality trends in Korea via period and cohort effects. Policies to reduce the growing burden of ID deaths should be further improved.","Kim, Hee Sook; Eun, Sang Jun",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7908575/,426

Designing smart apparel, in order to monitor physical and physiological functions in older users, is a crucial asset that user centered design is exploring, balancing needs expressed by the users with technological requirements related to the design process. In this paper, the authors describe a user centered methodology for the design of smart garments based on the evaluation of users’ acceptance of smart clothing. This comparison method can be considered as similar to a simplified version of the quality function deployment tool, and is used to evaluate the general response of each garment typology to different categories of requirements, determining the propensity of the older user to the utilization of the developed product. The suggested methodology aims at introducing in the design process a tool to evaluate and compare developed solutions, reducing complexity in design processes by providing a tool for the comparison of significant solutions, correlating quantitative and qualitative factors.","Imbesi, Silvia; Scataglini, Sofia",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8073818/,426

Therefore, how to improve their occupational health risks perception and regulate their coping behaviors should be of great concern. However, most prior studies target construction worker safety, and little research focuses on risk analysis from the psychological level of workers. Hence, construction workers’ occupational health risk perception level and coping behavior level in Nanjing and the influencing factors were analyzed through statistical analysis with 341 valid questionnaires. Bootstrapping was applied to test the mediating effects of risk perception on the proposed factors and coping behaviors. This study revealed that construction workers have a high-level of occupational health risk perception, yet low-level coping behavior. Gender, age, education level, and unit qualification cause differences in individual risk perception level. Personal knowledge and group effects significantly affect the level of risk perception, which subsequently affect coping behavior. Education level, monthly income, and personal knowledge influence the coping behavior through risk perception. Recommendations were put forward for risk perception and coping behavior improvement from the perspectives of construction workers themselves, enterprises, and governments. This study sheds new light for research areas of occupational health and risk management and provides beneficial practice for improving construction workers’ responses to occupational health risks.","Liu, Hui; Li, Jie; Li, Hongyang; Li, He; Mao, Peng; Yuan, Jingfeng",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8297174/,426
20379,Measuring the Association of Self-Perceived Physical and Social Neighborhood Environment with Health of Chinese Rural Residents,2021-08-08,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Glioblastoma (GB) is the most aggressive brain cancer in humans. Patient survival outcomes have remained dismal despite intensive research over the past 50 years, with a median overall survival of only 14.6 months. We highlight the critical role of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) on GB cancer stem cells and the tumor microenvironment which, in turn, influences cancer stem cells in driving tumorigenesis and treatment resistance. We present recent developments and underscore the need for further research into the GB tumor microenvironment. We discuss the novel therapeutic targeting of the RAS using existing commonly available medications and utilizing model systems to further this critical investigation. ABSTRACT: Glioblastoma (GB) is an aggressive primary brain tumor. Despite intensive research over the past 50 years, little advance has been made to improve the poor outcome, with an overall median survival of 14.6 months following standard treatment. Local recurrence is inevitable due to the quiescent cancer stem cells (CSCs) in GB that co-express stemness-associated markers and components of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS). The dynamic and heterogeneous tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a fundamental role in tumor development, progression, invasiveness, and therapy resistance. There is increasing evidence showing the critical role of the RAS in the TME influencing CSCs via its upstream and downstream pathways. Drugs that alter the hallmarks of cancer by modulating the RAS present a potential new therapeutic alternative or adjunct to conventional treatment of GB. Cerebral and GB organoids may offer a cost-effective method for evaluating the efficacy of RAS-modulating drugs on GB. We review the nexus between the GB TME, CSC niche, and the RAS, and propose re-purposed RAS-modulating drugs as a potential therapeutic alternative or adjunct to current standard therapy for GB.","O’Rawe, Michael; Kilmister, Ethan J.; Mantamadiotis, Theo; Kaye, Andrew H.; Tan, Swee T.; Wickremesekera, Agadha C.",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8392691/,426

This will alleviate the energy and environmental problems that China is currently facing. The integrated development of artificial intelligence and the energy industry has become inevitable in the development of future energy systems. This study applied a comprehensive evaluation index to the energy industry to calculate the comprehensive development index of the energy industry in 30 provinces of China from 2000 to 2017. Then, taking Guangdong and Jiangsu as examples, the synthetic control method was used to explore the direction and intensity of the integrated development of artificial intelligence and the energy industry on the comprehensive development level of the local energy industry. The results showed that when artificial intelligence (AI) and the energy industry achieved a stable coupled development without the need to move to the coordination stage, the coupling effect promoted the development of the regional energy industry, and the annual growth rate of the comprehensive development index was above 20%. This coupling effect passed the placebo test and ranking test and was significant at the 10% level, indicating the robustness and validity of the experimental results, which strongly confirmed the great potential of AI in re-empowering traditional industries from the data perspective. Based on the findings, corresponding policy recommendations were proposed on how to promote the development of inter-regional AI, how the government, enterprises, and universities could cooperate to promote the coordinated development of AI and energy, and how to guide the integration process of regional AI and energy industries according to local conditions, in order to maximize the technological dividend of AI and help the construction of smart energy in China.","Dong, Feng; Zhang, Shengnan; Zhu, Jiao; Sun, Jiaojiao",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8431408/,426

Here, we have explored bioactives, signaling pathways, and key proteins underlying the anti-gout activity of M. alba L. leaves for the first-time utilizing network pharmacology. Bioactives in M. alba L. leaves were detected through GC-MS (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrum) analysis and filtered by Lipinski’s rule. Target proteins connected to the filtered compounds and gout were selected from public databases. The overlapping target proteins between bioactives-interacted target proteins and gout-targeted proteins were identified using a Venn diagram. Bioactives-Proteins interactive networking for gout was analyzed to identify potential ligand-target and visualized the rich factor on the R package via the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway on STRING. Finally, a molecular docking test (MDT) between bioactives and target proteins was analyzed via AutoDock Vina. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) demonstrated that mechanisms of M. alba L. leaves against gout were connected to 17 signaling pathways on 26 compounds. AKT1 (AKT Serine/Threonine Kinase 1), γ-Tocopherol, and RAS signaling pathway were selected as a hub target, a key bioactive, and a hub signaling pathway, respectively. Furthermore, three main compounds (γ-Tocopherol, 4-Dehydroxy-N-(4,5-methylenedioxy-2-nitrobenzylidene) tyramine, and Lanosterol acetate) and three key target proteins—AKT1, PRKCA, and PLA2G2A associated with the RAS signaling pathway were noted for their highest affinity on MDT.

20983,The Impact of the Integrated Development of AI and Energy Industry on Regional Energy Industry: A Case of China,2021-08-25,"Prenatal exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV) can result in microencephaly and congenital Zika syndrome, although some brain cells and structures are spared by the virus for unknown reasons. Here, a novel murine model of fetal ZIKV infection incorporating intraventricular infection and cell type-specific in utero electroporation (IUE) was used to identify the time course of ZIKV infection and to determine the identity of cells that are initially infected or spared during neocortical neurogenesis. In vivo time course studies revealed the presence of ZIKV in apical radial glial cells (aRGCs) at early time points following virus exposure, while basal intermediate progenitor cells (bIPCs) became maximally (ZIKV(+)) after 3 d of virus exposure. ZIKV-infected fetal brains exhibited microencephaly as early as 1 d following infection, regardless of developmental age. This change in brain size was caused in part by apoptosis and reduced proliferation that persisted until birth. While 60% of aRGC basal fibers were perturbed during infection, 40% retained normal morphology, indicating that aRGCs are not uniformly vulnerable to ZIKV infection. To investigate this heterogeneous vulnerability, we performed genetic fate mapping using cell type-specific probes derived from a mouse embryonic day (E)15.5 neocortical wall single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) dataset. The results indicate that one class of aRGCs preferentially express the putative ZIKV entry receptor AXL and that these cells are more vulnerable to ZIKV infection than other aRGC subtypes with low AXL expression. Together, these data uncover crucial temporal and cellular details of ZIKV fetal brain infection for prevention strategies and for management of congenital Zika syndrome.","Shelton, Samantha M.; Soucy, Alexandra R.; Kurzion, Ronni; Zeldich, Ella; Connor, John H.; Haydar, Tarik F.",eNeuro,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8431824/,426

Social media may offer innovative care delivery solutions to address these challenges. OBJECTIVE: This study explored motivations and attitudes regarding current social media use and preferences for a social media platform in a sample of adolescents and young adults (AYA) with CF. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was administered to 50 AYA with CF followed at a large pediatric-adult CF center. The survey included questions regarding social media platform utilization, attitudes toward general and CF-specific online activities, and preferences for a CF-specific care delivery platform. RESULTS: YouTube, Snapchat, and Instagram were the most commonly used social media platforms. AYA with CF do not report routinely using social media for health-related information acquisition, social support, or help with adherence. However, their perceptions of social media utilization and preferences for platform development suggest interest in doing so in the future. CONCLUSIONS: AYA with CF use social media and expressed interest in the development of a social media platform. Platform development will allow for gaps in health care delivery to be addressed by improving social support and adherence while augmenting current methods of health information acquisition.","Perkins, Ryan C; Gross, Rachel; Regan, Kayla; Bishay, Lara; Sawicki, Gregory S",JMIR Pediatr Parent,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8406102/,426

The applied Fe(3)O(4)-NH(2) nanoparticles and GN exhibited typical structures and intended surface groups through characterizations via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and Raman spectroscopy. The Fe(3)O(4)-NH(2)-GN/GCE showed the maximum electrochemical signal for CBD during the comparison of fabricated components via the cyclic voltammetry method, and was systematically investigated in the composition and treatment of components, pH, scan rate, and quantitative analysis ability. Under optimal conditions, the Fe(3)O(4)-NH(2)-GN/GCE exhibited a good detection limit (0.04 μmol L(−1)) with a linear range of 0.1 μmol L(−1) to 100 μmol L(−1) (r(2) = 0.984). In the detection of CBD in the extract of C. sativa leaves, the results of the electrochemical method using the Fe(3)O(4)-NH(2)-GN/GCE were in good agreement with those of the HPLC method.

Results are confirmed when we (1) consider expenditures related to long-term investments, namely capital spending per capita, and (2) directly test the impact of government efficiency on tax evasion. In addition, we show that the impact of public spending is heterogeneous across geographical areas: an increase in public expenditure leads to a downward shift in tax evasion only in the northern part of Italy, characterized by a relatively larger initial level of public goods provision.","D’Agostino, Elena; De Benedetto, Marco Alberto; Sobbrio, Giuseppe",Econ Polit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8017438/,426
53600,"Displacement, Violence, and Mental Health: Evidence from Rohingya Adolescents in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh",2021-05-17,"This article lays out the contours of a novel approach to social change and interactions, based on the organic interplay of individuals, institutions, countries and the global society. This approach is based on the POZE paradigm, which posits that change starts inside and is nurtured from the outside in – both for individuals and for durable social change. Such a holistic perspective is crucial to build society as it emerges from the Pandemic. COVID-19 is a reminder that humans around the World are fundamentally all the same; the result of 4 dimensions – soul, heart, mind and body, which find their expression in aspirations, emotions, thoughts and sensations. These 4 dimensions constantly interact and influence each other in ways that reflect the 4-dimensional dynamic that shapes our collective existence. Individuals are the micro dimension that stands at the center of everything else. Forming part of various institutions, from families to parties, individuals are constitutive components of the meso dimension. Individuals and institutions form countries and economies, the macro-dimension. These dimensions in addition to nature and supra-national institutions form the meta-dimension. A constant interplay connects and determines what happens in each dimension and what derives from it. To thrive in the post-pandemic world, we must understand and optimize this interplay. This is the point of departure for the argumentation laid out in this article. The prevailing systemic imbalance in which many lack the means to cover their basic needs can only be addressed by planting the C-Core (completion, compassion, creativity, cooperation) at the center of human interactions. When we bring risks, responsibility and real opportunities together in one coherent framework whilst applying the proposed twice 4-dimensional paradigm-shift a set of concrete recommendations appears. Looking at individuals, and institutions, the article concludes with suggestions to seize this moment and shape not merely a response to the crises, but to lay the ground for a new social contract. In the past the C in C-Suite stood for Chief, the upper part of the leadership ladder in an institution. In the future that C must represent C-Core qualities.

199238,A Scoping Review of Psychosocial Risks to Health Workers during the Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"PURPOSE End-tidal CO2 (eTCO2) can be used to estimate the arterial CO2 (PaCO2) under steady-state conditions, but that relationship deteriorates during hemodynamic or respiratory instability. We developed a multivariate method to improve our ability to estimate the PaCO2, by using additional information contained in the volumetric capnograph (Vcap) waveform. We tested this approach using data from a porcine model of chest trauma/hemorrhage. METHODS This experiment consisted of 3 stages: pre-injury, injury/resuscitation, and post-injury. In stage I, anesthetized pigs (n=26) underwent ventilator maneuvers (tidal volume and respiratory rate) to induce hypo-or hyper-ventilation. In stage II, pigs underwent either (A) unilateral pulmonary contusion, hemorrhage, and resuscitation (n=13); or (B) bilateral pulmonary contusion (n=13) followed by 30 min of monitoring. In stage III, the ventilator maneuvers were repeated. The following Vcap features were measured: eTCO2, phase 2 slope (p2m), phase 3 slope (p3m), and inter-breath interval. The data were fit to 2 models: (1) multivariate linear regression and (2) a machine-learning model (M5P). RESULTS 1750 10-breath sets were analyzed. Univariate models employing eTCO2 alone were adequate during stages I and III. During stage II, mean error for the linear model was -8.44 mmHg (R(2)=0.14, P<0.001) and for M5P it was -5.98 mmHg (R(2)=0.13, P<0.01). By adding Vcap features, all models exhibited improvement. In stage II, the mean error of the linear model improved to -4.64 mmHg (R(2)=0.11, P<0.01), and that of the M5P model improved to -1.62 mmHg (R(2)=0.25, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS By incorporating Vcap waveform features, multivariate methods modestly improved PaCO2 estimation, especially during periods of hemodynamic and respiratory instability. Further work would be needed to produce a clinically useful CO2 monitoring system under these challenging conditions.","Belenkiy, Slava M; Baker, William L; Batchinsky, Andriy I; Mittal, Sumit; Watkins, Taylor; Salinas, Jose; Cancio, Leopoldo C",International journal of burns and trauma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26550531/,426

An outbreak of influenza A (H1N1) in northern Thailand in November 2007 offered opportunity to evaluate these interventions. An investigation was conducted to describe the outbreak, evaluate effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions and assess surge capacity of health agencies. A descriptive study was conducted by interviewing students and personnel in a school. We characterized transmission of the virus in this outbreak and explored effects of control measures. We identified that 44% of the students and teachers developed influenza during the 19-day outbreak. Non-pharmaceutical interventions including school closure, setting up a field hospital and community health education were implemented. These measures possibly limited the outbreak spreading to other schools nearby. Surveillance and preparedness plans could be strengthened to respond to pandemic and inter-pandemic influenza by using non-pharmaceutical interventions.","Sonthichai, Chaninan; Iamsirithaworn, S; Cummings, Dat; Shokekird, P; Niramitsantipong, A; Khumket, S; Chittaganpitch, M; Lessler, J","Outbreak, surveillance and investigation reports",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23504591/,426
199688,Pattern Recognition of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States: Implications for Disease Mitigation,2021,"Context The increasing number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally is shocking every day. US daily deaths have numbered over one-thousand people per day for nearly 3 days (from November 18, 2020 to November 20, 2020), and total deaths have exceeded 250 000 as of November 21, 2020, which drives the medical community to search for trends to provide an early warning of rising numbers of cases and to prevent future increases. Objective The study intended to evaluate available US COVID-19 data to determine the possibility of predicting the spread of COVID-19 in the USA. Design The research team collected US COVID-19 data from a time-series view and established a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model to predict trends. Results According to the spatial and temporal distribution of cumulative confirmed cases, US COVID-19 cases are mainly concentrated in areas with high population density, with that variable having a positive correlation to the number of confirmed cases and deaths. The correlation coefficients are 0.95 and 0.817, respectively, indicating that the transmission of COVID-19 in the USA is characterized by agglomeration. After exploring the impact of population density, the research team established a SARIMA model to predict the trends, finding that US COVID-19 cases will continue to go up. Conclusions By combining knowledge of the statistical features of the virus with modeling findings, the study determined a method that can improve understanding of the serious pandemic, paving the way toward the development of predictive and preventative solutions.","Ding, Yongmei; Huang, Rui; Shao, Ningyi",Alternative therapies in health and medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33421047/,426

Treatments, although having lifestyle and dietary change as core components, have been focused on optimising glycaemic control using pharmaceutical agents. With data from bariatric surgery and, more recently, total diet replacement (TDR) studies which have set out to achieve remission; remission of T2DM has emerged as treatment goal. A group of specialist dietitians, medical practitioners was convened, supported by the British Dietetic Association and Diabetes UK, to discuss dietary approaches to T2DM, and undertook a review of the available clinical trial and practice audit data regarding dietary approaches to remission of T2DM. Current available evidence suggests a range of dietary approaches, including low energy diets (mostly using TDR) and low carbohydrate diets, can be used to support the achievement of euglycaemia and potentially remission. The most significant predictor of remission is weight loss, and although euglycaemia may occur on a low carbohydrate diet without weight loss, which does not meet some definitions of remission, but may rather constitute a 'state of mitigation' of T2DM. This technical point may not be considered important for people living with T2DM, aside from that it may only last as long as the carbohydrate restriction is maintained. The possibility of actively treating T2DM along with the possibility of achieving remission should be discussed by healthcare professionals with people living with T2DM, along with a range of different dietary approaches which can help to achieve it.

Thus, emergency cardiac catheterization is needed. However, during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is recommended for hemodynamically stable acute coronary syndrome patients with COVID-19 infection to be treated conservatively in an isolated hospital ward. CASE PRESENTATION: We report an 85-year-old patient with chief complaints of typical, squeezing chest pain in the past 4 h. The patient had a high fever, dyspnea, sore throat, and fatigue for 3 days. He had previously come into contact with COVID-19 positive relatives. The patient was hemodynamically stable and pulmonary auscultation revealed coarse rales in the entire lung. Electrocardiography (ECG) evaluation during the pain episode showed non-specific ST-T changes in lead V2-V5. After sublingual nitrate was administered, ECG evaluation during the pain-free period revealed a biphasic T wave inversion in lead V2 and V3. Laboratory workup showed elevated cardiac marker and leucopenia with neutrophilia and lymphopenia. Rapid immunochromatographic test and initial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) evaluation from nasopharyngeal swab showed negative results. However, radiographic evaluations suggest the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. While waiting for the second RT-PCR evaluation, the patient was diagnosed with Wellens' syndrome with suspected COVID-19 infection. The patient was treated conservatively according to national guidelines and scheduled for elective cardiac catheterization. On the third day, the patient felt better and insisted on being discharged home. Ten days after discharged, the patient died of myocardial infarction. CONCLUSION: Emergency cardiac catheterization should be done for patient with Wellens' syndrome, regardless of the COVID-19 infection status.","Suryawan, I Gde Rurus; Bakhriansyah, Jordan; Puspitasari, Mia; Gandi, Parama; Intan, Ryan Enast; Alkaff, Firas Farisi",Egypt Heart J,,426

213570,Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Budgetary Mechanism Established to Cover Public Health Expenditure. A Case Study of Romania,2021,"A new bioinspired computational model was developed for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic using the available epidemiological information, high-resolution population density data, travel patterns, and the average number of contacts between people. The effectiveness of control measures such as contact reduction measures, closure of communities (lockdown), protective measures (social distancing, face mask wearing, and hand hygiene), and vaccination were modelled to examine possibilities for control of the disease under several protective vaccination levels in the population. Lockdown and contact reduction measures only delay the spread of the virus in the population because it resumes its previous dynamics as soon as the restrictions are lifted. Nevertheless, these measures are probably useful to avoid hospitals being overwhelmed in the short term. Our model predicted that 56% of the Spanish population would have been infected and subsequently recovered over a 130 day period if no protective measures were taken but this percentage would have been only 34% if protective measures had been put in place. Moreover, this percentage would have been further reduced to 41.7, 27.7, and 13.3% if 25, 50 and 75% of the population had been vaccinated, respectively. Finally, this percentage would have been even lower at 25.5, 12.1 and 7.9% if 25, 50 and 75% of the population had been vaccinated in combination with the application of protective measures, respectively. Therefore, a combination of protective measures and vaccination would be highly efficacious in decreasing not only the number of those who become infected and subsequently recover, but also the number of people who die from infection, which falls from 0.41% of the population over a 130 day period without protective measures to 0.15, 0.08 and 0.06% if 25, 50 and 75% of the population had been vaccinated in combination with protective measures at the same time, respectively.","Colomer, Mª Àngels; Margalida, Antoni; Alòs, Francesc; Oliva-Vidal, Pilar; Vilella, Anna; Fraile, Lorenzo",Sci Total Environ,,426

In this study, a rapid solvent extraction was employed to analyze gelled ABHRs via gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. In total, 26 liquid and 16 gelled ABHRs were analyzed for nine common impurities to determine compliance with Health Canada interim guidelines. Of 42 samples analyzed, 11 ABHRs appear to be non-compliant with interim Health Canada guidelines. Non-compliant ABHRs exhibited elevated concentrations of acetaldehyde, with a maximal concentration observed of 251 +/- 10 microL L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;;3.3x higher than currently permitted. Nonetheless, frequent testing of ABHRs should be routinely conducted to reduce the risk of consumer exposure to non-compliant ABHRs.","Tse, T. J.; Nelson, F. B.; Reaney, M. J.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic posed an array of challenges and opportunities to the healthcare system in 2020, and it will continue to do so in 2021. Remarkably, by late November 2020, two anti-SARS-CoV antibody products, bamlanivimab and the casirivimab and imdevimab cocktail, were authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the repurposed antibodies levilimab and itolizumab had been registered for emergency use as treatments for COVID-19 in Russia and India, respectively. Despite the pandemic, 10 antibody therapeutics had been granted the first approval in the US or EU in 2020, as of November, and 2 more (tanezumab and margetuximab) may be granted approvals in December 2020.* In addition, prolgolimab and olokizumab had been granted first approvals in Russia and cetuximab saratolacan sodium was first approved in Japan. The number of approvals in 2021 may set a record, as marketing applications for 16 investigational antibody therapeutics are already undergoing regulatory review by either the FDA or the European Medicines Agency. Of these 16 mAbs, 11 are possible treatments for non-cancer indications and 5 are potential treatments for cancer. Based on the information publicly available as of November 2020, 44 antibody therapeutics are in late-stage clinical studies for non-cancer indications, including 6 for COVID-19, and marketing applications for at least 6 (leronlimab, tezepelumab, faricimab, ligelizumab, garetosmab, and fasinumab) are planned in 2021. In addition, 44 antibody therapeutics are in late-stage clinical studies for cancer indications. Of these 44, marketing application submissions for 13 may be submitted by the end of 2021. *Note added in proof on key events announced during December 1-21, 2020: margetuximab-cmkb and ansuvimab-zykl were approved by FDA on December 16 and 21, 2020, respectively; biologics license applications were submitted for ublituximab and amivantamab.","Kaplon, Hélène; Reichert, Janice M",MAbs,,426

221100,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Vulnerable People Suffering from Depression: Two Studies on Adults in France,2021,"Background: The occurrence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have profoundly affected adult kidney disease patients. In contrast, pediatric solid organ transplant recipients, including pediatric kidney transplant (KT) recipients, do not seem to be at particularly higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or for severe COVID-19 disease. This patient population might be protected by certain mechanisms, such as the immunosuppressive medications with their anti-inflammatory properties or simply being well-versed in self-protection techniques. Assessing SARS-CoV-2 antibody serologies could potentially help understand why this patient population is apparently spared from severe SARS-CoV-2 clinical courses. Objective: To examine SARS-CoV-2 serologic status in a cohort of pediatric KT recipients. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG and IgM antibodies were measured by three different methods in pediatric KT recipients coming for routine clinic visits immediately post-confinement in May-June of 2020. The patients were considered seroconverted if SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were positive by 2/3 methods and weak positive/indeterminate if positive by 1/3. Results: Thirty-one patients were evaluated (about 1/3 of our institution's pediatric KT population). One patient seroconverted, while three were considered weak positive/indeterminate. None were symptomatic and none had nasopharyngeal PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 disease. Conclusions: Seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 was rare in this population and likely reflects the social distancing practiced by these patients. The results will serve as a foundation for a future longitudinal study to evaluate the long-term emergence and persistence of antibodies in this population and may inform studies of response to a future vaccine.","Nailescu, Corina; Khalid, Myda; Wilson, Amy C; Amanat, Fatima; Arregui, Samuel; Canas, Jorge; Hooks, Jenaya; Krammer, Florian; Schwaderer, Andrew L; Hains, David S",Front Pediatr,,426

If not balanced, the inflammation may cause extensive tissue damage, which is associated with common diseases, e.g. asthma and atherosclerosis. Anti-inflammatory drugs come with side-effects which may be aggravated by high and fluctuating drug concentrations. To remedy this, an anti-inflammatory drug should have an appropriate pharmacokinetic half-life or better still: a sustained anti-inflammatory drug response. However, we still lack a quantitative mechanistic understanding of such sustained effects. Here, we study the anti-inflammatory response to a common glucocorticoid drug, Dexamethasone. We find a sustained response 22 hours after drug removal. With hypothesis testing using mathematical modeling, we unravel the underlying mechanism - a slow release of Dexamethasone from the receptor-drug complex. The developed model is in agreement with time-resolved training and testing data, and is used to simulate hypothetical treatment schemes. This work opens up for a more knowledge-driven drug development, to find sustained anti-inflammatory responses and fewer side effects.","Nyman, Elin; Lindh, Maria; Lövfors, William; Simonsson, Christian; Persson, Alexander; Eklund, Daniel; Bäckström, Erica; Fridén, Markus; Cedersund, Gunnar",CPT: pharmacomet. syst. pharmacol,,426

Among a provincial (British Columbia) sample, we determined the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine intention by HIV status and assessed socio-demographic, vaccine hesitancy, and psychological predictors of vaccine intention. MethodsIndividuals (25-69y) recruited from province-wide research cohorts completed an online survey examining COVID-19 impacts (August/2020-March/2021). Among women and gender diverse participants, we compared intention to receive a recommended COVID-19 vaccine (Very likely/Likely vs Neutral/Unlikely/Very Unlikely) by self-reported HIV status. Logistic regression models assessed the independent effect of HIV status and other factors on vaccine intention. ResultsOf 5,588 participants, 69 (1.2%) were PLWH, of whom 79.7% were on antiretroviral therapy. Intention to vaccinate was significantly lower among PLWH compared to participants not living with HIV (65.2% vs 79.6%; OR: 0.44; 95%CI: 0.32-0.60). However, this association was attenuated after adjustment for social disparities (aOR:0.85; 95%CI: 0.48-1.55). Among PLWH, those with greater vaccine confidence, positive attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine, and more strongly influenced by direct and indirect social norms to vaccinate had significantly higher odds of vaccine intention. DiscussionTailored messaging is needed to build vaccine confidence, address questions about vaccine benefits, and support informed vaccination decision-making to promote COVID-19 vaccine uptake among women and gender diverse PLWH.","Kaida, Angela; Brotto, Lori A.; Murray, Melanie C.M.; Cote, Helene C.F.; Albert, Arianne Y.; Nicholson, Valerie; Gormley, Rebecca; Gordon, Shanlea; Booth, Amy; Smith, Laurie W.; Baaske, Ally; Galea, Liisa A.M.; Sadarangani, Manish; Ogilvie, Gina S.",,,426

During lockdown outpatient visits were limited and telemedicine (TM) was encouraged. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from continuous or flash glucose monitoring systems shared through different cloud systems during the lockdown by subjects with type 1 diabetes and compared data obtained 4 weeks before and 4 weeks after structured telephonic visit. Variables considered were mean glucose, time spent in target (70-180 mg/dl), hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dl) and hyperglycemia (>180 mg/dl), coefficient of variation, and length of sensor use. RESULTS: During the 4 weeks following the telephonic visit there was an improvement of glycemic control, with a significant reduction of mean glucose values (161.1 before vs 156.3 mg/dl after, p = 0.001), an increase of the time spent in target (63.6 vs 66.3, p = 0.0009) and a reduction of time spent in hyperglycemia (33.4 vs 30.5, p = 0.002). No changes were observed regarding glucose variability, time spent in hypoglycemia, and length of sensor use. Similar results were observed in subjects treated with multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.

SETTING: Large tertiary care health system in the Bronx, NY, USA. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 4613 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients admitted between March 10, 2020, and May 11, 2020. We examined in-hospital intubation, acute kidney injury (AKI), hospitalization length, and in-hospital mortality by HIV serostatus, and by HIV-viral suppression and CD4 counts among people living with HIV (PLWH) using adjusted competing risks regression. We also compared immune and inflammatory marker levels by HIV serostatus and viral suppression. RESULTS: Most patients were either non-Hispanic Black (36%) or Hispanic (37%); 100/4613 (2.2%) were PLWH, among whom 15 had detectable HIV viral load. PLWH compared to patients without HIV had increased intubation rates (adjusted hazard ratio 1.73 [95% CI: 1.12 to 2.67], P = 0.01). Both groups had similar rates of AKI, length of hospitalization, and death. No (0%) virally unsuppressed PLWH were intubated or died, versus 21/81 (26%, P = 0.04) and 22/81 (27%, P = 0.02) of virally suppressed PLWH, respectively. Among PLWH, higher CD4 T-cell counts were associated with increased intubation rates. C-reactive protein, IL-6, neutrophil counts, and ferritin levels were similar between virally suppressed PLWH and patients without HIV, but significantly lower for unsuppressed PLWH (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PLWH had increased risk of intubation but similarly frequent rates of AKI and in-hospital death as those without HIV. Findings of no intubations or deaths among PLWH with unsuppressed HIV viral load warrant further investigation.","Patel, Viraj V; Felsen, Uriel R; Fisher, Molly; Fazzari, Melissa J; Ginsberg, Mindy S; Beil, Robert; Akiyama, Matthew J; Anastos, Kathryn; Hanna, David B",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,,426

We investigated the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in Sergipe state, Northeast Brazil, using rapid IgM-IgG antibody test and fluorescence immunoassay. The seroprevalence was 9.3% (95% CI 8.5-10.1), 10.2% (95% CI 9.2-11.3) for women and 7.9% (IC 95% 6.8-9.1) for men (P = 0.004). We found a decline in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies according to age, but the differences were not statistically significant: 0-19 years (9.9%; 95% CI 7.8-12.5), 20-59 years (9.3%; 95% CI 8.4-10.3) and &#8805;60 years (9.0%; 95% CI 7.5-10.8) (P = 0.517).

The sources of uncertainty in such monitoring system are numerous and the concentration measurements it provides are left-censored and contain numerous outliers, which biases the results of usual smoothing methods. Hence the need for an adapted pre-processing in order to evaluate the real daily amount of virus arriving to each WWTP. We propose a method based on an auto-regressive model adapted to censored data with outliers. Inference and prediction are produced via a discretised smoother which makes it a very flexible tool. This method is both validated on simulations and on real data from Ob\'epine. The resulting smoothed signal shows a good correlation with other epidemiological indicators and currently contributes to the construction of the wastewater indicators provided each week by Ob\'epine.","Courbariaux, Marie; Cluzel, Nicolas; Wang, Siyun; Mar'echal, Vincent; Moulin, Laurent; Wurtzer, S'ebastien; consortium, Ob'epine; Mouchel, Jean-Marie; Maday, Yvon; Nuel, Gr'egory",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.02115v2.pdf,426

Evidence from China based on the geographical perspective,2021,"The mouse-deer or chevrotains are the smallest of the ungulates and ruminants. They are characterized by a number of traits which are considered plesiomorphic for the Artiodactyla order. The objective of this study was to examine sleep in the lesser mouse-deer (Tragulus kanchil), which is the smallest in this group (body mass <2.2 kg). Electroencephalogram, nuchal electromyogram, electrooculogram and body acceleration were recorded in 4 adult mouse-deer females using a telemetry system in Bu Gia Map National Park in Vietnam. The mouse-deer spent on average 49.7±3.0% of 24-h in NREM sleep. REM sleep occupied 1.7±0.3% of 24-h or 3.2±0.5% of total sleep time. The average duration of REM sleep episodes was 2.0±0.2 min, the average maximum was 5.1±1.1 min, and the longest episodes lasted 8 min. NREM sleep occurred in sternal recumbency with the head heals above the ground while 64.7+6.4% of REM sleep occurred with the head resting on the ground. The eyes were open throughout most of the NREM sleep period. The mouse-deer displayed polyphasic sleep and crepuscular peaks in activity (04:00-06:00 and 18:00-19:00). The largest amounts of NREM occurred in the morning (06:00-09:00) and the smallest before dusk (at 04:00-06:00). REM sleep occurred throughout most of the daylight hours (08:00-16:00) and in the first half of the night (19:00-02:00). We suggest that the pattern and timing of sleep in the lesser mouse-deer is adapted to the survival of a small herbivorous animal, subject to predation, living in high environmental temperatures in tropical forest undergrowth.","Lyamin, Oleg I; Siegel, Jerome M; Nazarenko, Evgeny A; Rozhnov, Viatcheslav V",Sleep,,426

METHODS: Compartmental models were used to estimate deaths under different combinations of ICU and ward care required and received in England up to late April 2021. Model parameters were sourced from publicly available government information and organisations collating COVID-19 data. A sub-model was used to estimate the mortality scalars that represent increased mortality due to insufficient ICU or general ward bed capacity. Three illustrative scenarios for admissions numbers, 'Optimistic', 'Middling' and 'Pessimistic', were modelled and compared with the subsequent observations to the 3rd February. RESULTS: The key output was the demand and capacity model described. There were no excess deaths from a lack of capacity in the 'Optimistic' scenario. Several of the 'Middling' scenario applications resulted in excess deaths-up to 597 deaths (0.6% increase) with a 20% reduction compared to best estimate ICU capacity. All the 'Pessimistic' scenario applications resulted in excess deaths, ranging from 49,178 (17.0% increase) for a 20% increase in ward bed availability, to 103,735 (35.8% increase) for a 20% shortfall in ward bed availability. These scenarios took no account of the emergence of the new, more transmissible, variant of concern (b.1.1.7). CONCLUSIONS: Mortality is increased when hospital demand exceeds available capacity. No excess deaths from breaching capacity would be expected under the 'Optimistic' scenario. The 'Middling' scenario could result in some excess deaths-up to a 0.7% increase relative to the total number of deaths. The 'Pessimistic' scenario would have resulted in significant excess deaths. Our sensitivity analysis indicated a range between 49,178 (17% increase) and 103,735 (35.8% increase). Given the new variant, the pessimistic scenario appeared increasingly likely and could have resulted in a substantial increase in the number of COVID-19 deaths. In the event, it would appear that capacity was not breached at any stage at a national level with no excess deaths. it will remain unclear if minor local capacity breaches resulted in any small number of excess deaths.","Martin, Christopher; McDonald, Stuart; Bale, Steve; Luteijn, Michiel; Sarkar, Rahul",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,,426

251067,The Research on Patient Satisfaction with Remote Healthcare Prior to and during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Introduction: In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 originated from China, and spread rapidly to several countries, bringing a frightening scarcity of personal protective equipment (PPE). The CDC recommends N95 or higher-level particulate filtering respirators as part of the PPE while caring for patients with COVID-19, with facemasks as an alternative; and cloth face-coverings in public where social distancing of at least 6 ft. is not feasible. With new evidence about the efficacy of facemasks, knowledge gaps remain. Areas covered: This reviews the history of respiratory viral pandemics and PPE use, exploring the influenza pandemics of the 20th and 21st century, and prior coronavirus pandemics. A literature search of PubMed and google was done between March 22nd to May 2nd, and on September 28, 2020. The evidence for PPE is described, to delineate their efficacy and 'best safe' practices. Solutions to ameliorate pandemic preparedness to meet surge-capacity to efficiently combat future pandemics, should they arise, are discussed. Expert opinion: PPE, when used appropriately in addition to other infection control measures, is effective protection during respiratory viral pandemics. The current evidence suggests that wearing facemasks in the community is protective, especially if used consistently and correctly with other infection control measures such as hand hygiene.","Eke, Uzoamaka A; Eke, Ahizechukwu C",Expert Rev Respir Med,,426

Most of them were transferred from smaller hospitals, often due to the need for an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation system. Autopsy was performed in 8/17 COVID-19-proven patients after long-term treatment (mean: 33.6 days). Autopsy revealed that the typical pathological changes occurring during the early stages of the disease (e.g., thrombosis, endothelitis, capillaritis) are less prevalent at this stage, while severe diffuse alveolar damage and especially coinfection with different fungal species were the most conspicuous finding. In addition, signs of macrophage activation syndrome was detected in 7 of 8 patients. Thus, fungal infections were a leading cause of death in our cohort of severely ill patients and may alter clinical management of patients, particularly in long-term periods of treatment.","Evert, Katja; Dienemann, Thomas; Brochhausen, Christoph; Lunz, Dirk; Lubnow, Matthias; Ritzka, Markus; Keil, Felix; Trummer, Matthias; Scheiter, Alexander; Salzberger, Bernd; Reischl, Udo; Boor, Peter; Gessner, André; Jantsch, Jonathan; Calvisi, Diego F; Evert, Matthias; Schmidt, Barbara; Simon, Michaela",Virchows arch,,426

We measured close (<6 ft), prolonged (>10 min) staff interactions in a busy pediatric Emergency Department in common work areas over time as the pandemic unfolded, measuring the effectiveness of interventions meant to discourage such close contact. METHODS: We used a Real-Time Locating System to measure staff groupings in crowded common work areas lasting ten or more minutes. We compared the number of these interactions pre-pandemic with those occurring early and then later in the pandemic, as distancing interventions were suggested and then formalized. Nearly all healthcare workers in the ED were included, and the duration of interactions over time were evaluated as well. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: This study included a total of 12,386 pairs of staff-to-staff encounters over three time periods including just prior to the pandemic, early in the pandemic response, and later in the steady-state pandemic response. Pairs of staff averaged 0.89 high-risk interactions hourly prior to the pandemic, and this continued early in the pandemic with informal recommendations (0.80 high-risk pairs hourly). High-risk staff encounters fell significantly to 0.47 interactions per hour in the steady-state pandemic with formal distancing guidelines in place and decreased patient and staffing volumes. The duration of these encounters remained stable, near 16 min. Close contact between healthcare staff workers did significantly decrease with formal distancing guidelines, though some high-risk interactions remained, warranting additive protective measures such as universal masking.","Barrick, Lindsey; Overmann, Kevin M; LaBare, Jonathan; Wu, Danny T Y",Am J Emerg Med,,426

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to evaluate the association between the elevated CK and severity and mortality in COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search on PubMed, Scopus, and Embase up until January 26, 2020. The main outcome was poor outcome, a composite of mortality and severe COVID-19. RESULTS: There are 2471 patients from 14 studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The incidence of elevated CK in this pooled analysis was 17% (11%, 22%) and the incidence of poor outcome in this pooled analysis was 27% (19%, 34%). Elevated CK was associated with poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 (OR 3.01 [2.21, 4.10], p < 0.001; I2: 10.2%). The effect estimate did not vary with age (p = 0.610), male (p = 0.449), hypertension (p = 0.490), and diabetes (p = 0.457). Elevated CK has a sensitivity of 0.24 (0.17, 0.32), specificity of 0.91 (0.86, 0.94), PLR of 2.6 (1.9, 3.7), NLR of 0.84 (0.78, 0.90), DOR of 3 (2, 5), and AUC of 0.62 (0.57, 0.66) for predicting poor outcome in patients with COVID-19. In this pooled analysis, elevated CK confers to a 49% probability for poor outcome and a non-elevated CK confers to a 24% probability. Subgroup analysis and univariate meta-regression indicates that the sensitivity and specificity does not vary with age, male, hypertension, and diabetes. CONCLUSION: Elevated CK was associated with increased mortality and severity in patients with COVID-19.

266776,Prediction Models for Public Health Containment Measures on COVID-19 Using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: A Systematic Review,2021,"INTRODUCTION: It is challenging to diagnose syncope in patients with pacemakers. Because these patients have increased morbidity and mortality risks, they require immediate attention to determine the causes in order to provide appropriate treatment. This study aimed to investigate the causes and predictive factors of syncope as well as the methods used to diagnose syncope in cardiac pacemaker patients. METHODS: Patients with pacemakers implanted owing to sinus node disease or atrioventricular block were evaluated with standardized questionnaires, endocavitary electrograms, and other tests based on the suspected causes of syncope. Mann- Whitney U tests were used to analyze continuous variables and Chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests were used for categorical variables. Logistic regression was used for multivariate analyses. Statistical significance was P<0.05. RESULTS: The study included 95 patients with pacemakers: 47 experienced syncope in the last 12 months and 48 did not. Of the 100 documented episodes of syncope, 48.9% were vasovagal syncopes, 17% had cardiac-related causes, 10.6% had unknown causes, and 8.5% had pacemaker failure. The multivariate analysis showed that a New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II was a significant factor for developing syncope (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: While the most common type of syncope in pacemaker patients was neurally mediated, it is important to perform detailed evaluations in this population as the causes of syncope can be life-threatening. The best diagnostic methods were stored electrogram analysis and the tilt table test. NYHA Functional Class II patients were found to have a higher risk for syncope.","Rocha, Eduardo Arrais; Cunha, Gisele Schineider; Tavares, Aline Bezerra; Viana, Antônio Brazil; Quidute, Ana Rosa Pinto; Pereira, Francisca Tatiana Moreira; Monteiro, Marcelo de Paula Martins; Rocha, Maria Eduarda Quidute Arrais; Gomes, Camila Rabelo Ferreira; Rodrigues, Carlos Roberto Martins",Braz J Cardiovasc Surg,,426

The Tibet Autonomous Region (Tibet) of China is the most epidemic area of echinococcosis worldwide. Echinococcosis poses an enormous threat to local public health and economic development. Identifying vulnerable populations and analyzing people's knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) with respect to echinococcosis is necessary to prevent and control echinococcosis. Based on reported cases and questionnaire responses, we first used a k-prototypes clustering algorithm to identify vulnerable populations according to human demographics (including gender, age, education level, and occupation). We then used a KAP analysis to evaluate the Tibetan people's understanding of echinococcosis. The results identified three types of vulnerable population. Vulnerable population I comprised illiterate middle-aged and older women engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry. Vulnerable population II comprised illiterate middle-aged male herdsmen. Vulnerable population III comprised young male farmers with a low education level. The KAP analysis indicated that the pass rate for all participants was 72.6%, 6.4%, 95.0%, and 75.8% for KAP, K, A, and P, respectively. The pass rates were significantly different among different age and gender groups. Based on these results, it is necessary to improve public health education and professional training, and to implement effective control and management measures targeting typical hosts of echinococcosis. This study provides a direct reference for the prevention and control of echinococcosis in Tibet.","Yin, Jie; Gongsang, Quzhen; Wang, Liying; Li, Chenlu; Wu, Xiaoxu",Environ Res,,426

Results: A total of 3042 articles were identified, of which 142 studies were included, with 49 048 hospitalized COVID-19 patients including 5152 AKI events. The risk of bias of included studies was generally low. The pooled incidence of AKI was 28.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 19.8-39.5] among hospitalized COVID-19 patients from the USA and Europe (20 studies) and 5.5% (95% CI 4.1-7.4) among patients from China (62 studies), whereas the pooled incidence of KRT was 7.7% (95% CI 5.1-11.4; 18 studies) and 2.2% (95% CI 1.5-3.3; 52 studies), respectively. Among patients admitted to the intensive care unit, the incidence of KRT was 20.6% (95% CI 15.7-26.7; 38 studies). Meta-regression analyses showed that age, male sex, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and chronic kidney disease were associated with the occurrence of AKI; in itself, AKI was associated with an increased risk of mortality, with a pooled risk ratio of 4.6 (95% CI 3.3-6.5). Conclusions: AKI and KRT are common events in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with estimates varying across geographic locations. Additional studies are needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and optimal treatment of AKI in these patients.","Fu, Edouard L; Janse, Roemer J; de Jong, Ype; van der Endt, Vera H W; Milders, Jet; van der Willik, Esmee M; de Rooij, Esther N M; Dekkers, Olaf M; Rotmans, Joris I; van Diepen, Merel",Clin Kidney J,,426

281357,"Trends in Healthcare Access in Japan during the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic, up to June 2020",2021,"Documentation of structured community engagement initiatives and real-time monitoring of community engagement activities during large-scale epidemics is limited. To inform such initiatives, this paper analyses the Community Led Ebola Action (CLEA) approach implemented through the Social Mobilization Action Consortium (SMAC) during the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone. The SMAC initiative consisted of a network of 2466 community mobilisers, >6000 religious leaders and 42 local radio stations across all 14 districts of Sierra Leone. Community mobilisers were active in nearly 70% of all communities across the country using the CLEA approach to facilitate community analysis, trigger collective action planning and maintain community action plans over time. CLEA was complemented by interactive radio programming and intensified religious leader engagement.Community mobilisers trained in the CLEA approach used participatory methods, comprised of an initial community 'triggering' event, action plan development and weekly follow-ups to monitor progress on identified action items. Mobilisers collected operational and behavioural data on a weekly basis as part of CLEA. We conducted a retrospective analysis of >50 000 weekly reports from approximately 12 000 communities from December 2014 to September 2015. The data showed that 100% of the communities that were engaged had one or more action plans in place. Out of the 63 110 cumulative action points monitored by community mobilisers, 92% were marked as 'in-progress' (85%) or 'achieved' (7%) within 9 months. A qualitative examination of action points revealed that the in-progress status was indicative of the long-term sustainability of most action points (eg, continuous monitoring of visitors into the community) versus one-off action items that were marked as achieved (eg, initial installation of handwashing station). Analysis of behavioural outcomes of the intervention indicate an increase over time in the fraction of reported safe burials and fraction of reported cases referred for medical care within 24 hours of symptom onset in the communities that were engaged.Through CLEA, we have demonstrated how large-scale, coordinated community engagement interventions can be achieved and monitored in real-time during future Ebola epidemics and other similar epidemics. The SMAC initiative provides a practical model for the design, implementation and monitoring of community engagement, integration and coordination of community engagement interventions with other health emergency response pillars, and adaptive strategies for large-scale community-based operational data collection.","Bedson, Jamie; Jalloh, Mohamed F; Pedi, Danielle; Bah, Saiku; Owen, Katharine; Oniba, Allan; Sangarie, Musa; Fofanah, James S; Jalloh, Mohammed B; Sengeh, Paul; Skrip, Laura; Althouse, Benjamin M; Hébert-Dufresne, Laurent",,,426

286377,"The Effect of Lockdown Period during the COVID-19 Pandemic on Air Quality in Sydney Region, Australia",2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact routes, hence the demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) has increased during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Among the most noticeable shortages was the lack of face shields. The urgent demand for PPE induced interdisciplinary cooperation to overcome the shortages, and additive manufacturing proved to be ideal for the crisis situation. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the possibilities of implementing additive manufacturing technologies in the interventional fabrication of protective face shields for medical staff. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An Ender 3 Pro 3D printer was used to print headbands and Cura 4.4 was chosen as the slicing software. Open source face shield designs were downloaded as standard tessellation language (STL) files and compared. Only models with scientific support were taken under consideration. RESULTS: The mean time for producing the headbands tested ranged from 59 min to almost 3 h, depending on the design. After setting up our low budget printer and choosing the Prusa RC 3 protective face shield as the main product, we were able to fabricate about 30 face shields per week at a cost of about 1 each. During 4 weeks, 126 face shields were produced and delivered to various hospital wards, which substantially eased the shortages. CONCLUSIONS: Additive manufacturing enables immediate responses to needs in emergency situations, and allows for mass production of personal protective equipment in a short time due the rapid exchange of data among printer users. Despite the unregulated legal situation and insufficient scientific evidence, such protective equipment has been approved by clinicians and is currently used by medical personnel around the world.","Wierzbicki, Jedrzej; Nowacki, Maciej; Chrzanowska, Marta; Matkowski, Rafal; Zietek, Marcin; Nowacka, Katarzyna; Maciejczyk, Adam; Pawlak-Adamska, Edyta",Adv Clin Exp Med,,426

289646,Changes in Drug Use Patterns during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Italy: Monitoring a Vulnerable Group by Hair Analysis,2021,"Rationale: Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy has previously been contraindicated in solid organ transplant recipients. This was due to lack of data and concern for interaction with immunosuppressive drug regimens. However, in post-lung transplant recipients, CFTR modulators may improve extra-pulmonary manifestations of cystic fibrosis without impacting graft function or drug levels. Herein, we present our single center experience with the use of Trikafta in post-lung transplant recipients.Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the charts of 9 lung transplant recipients who were started on Trikafta since December of 2019. Trikafta was started in patients with poorly controlled CF-related diabetes, sinus issues, significant GI manifestations, or inability to gain weight. We assessed graft function utilizing ISHLT staging, immunosuppressive drug dosing before and after starting Trikafta, any reported side effects, white blood cell (WBC) count, weight, blood sugar monitoring, sinus and GI symptoms, and need for surgical intervention.Results: Trikafta was initiated a mean of 1,249.6 days post-transplant. Of the 9 patients, 5 were female and 4 were male. 1 patient died due to complications of COVID ARDS and 1 patient underwent retransplantation, at which time Trikafta was stopped. All patients had stable or increased graft function except for 2;one of which underwent retransplantation and the second was relisted for retransplantation. All patients were treated with tacrolimus with only one requiring significant dose adjustment. 1 patient experienced joint pain for which Trikafta dosing was reduced and another patient experienced abdominal pain for which Trikafta was stopped, with plans to re-introduce at a lower dose. WBC remained stable in all patients. 50% of people gained weight with mean change of 5.2lbs. One patient was able to stop insulin usage completely with the remainder having stable blood sugar levels. Sinus symptoms were reported to have improved in 8/9 patients. Complains of GI symptoms including gastroparesis, fullness, bloating and reflux improved in all patients. No patient underwent surgical intervention for GI or sinus complications after initiation of Trikafta. Conclusion: Our single center experience revealed that Trikafta did not impact graft function or cause significant drug to drug interactions with immunosuppressive regimens. Our patients tolerated Trikafta well without significant side effects and half gained weight. GI and sinus symptoms improved in the majority of our patients without the need for any surgical intervention.","Benninger, L.; Trillo, C.

Twenty-one diseased pigs were diagnosed with the PRRS virus (PRRSV) and other 7 virus primers by PCR/RT-PCR in the lung and spleen samples. Enterobacteria were isolated using MacConkey agar from 5 visceral samples of PRRS pigs, and identified by 16S rDNA sequencing. PRRSV was positive in 100% of the lung samples and 81.0% of the spleen samples. Seven diseased pigs were diagnosed with only PRRSV infection (33.3%), 7 pigs with PRRSV and 1 or 2 other viruses (33.3%) and 7 pigs with PRRSV and more than 2 types of other viruses (33.3%). PRRSV was more inclined to co-infect pigs with porcine group A rotavirus (PARV) with the co-infection rate of 52.4% (11/21). Approximately 13 types of bacteria were successfully isolated from lung, spleen, liver, kidney and lymph node samples of different PRRS pigs. Enterobacteria were isolated in 100% of lung, liver and lymph samples from pigs infected with PRRSV alone. However, the isolation rates were significantly decreased in the more than 3 viruses co-infection group. Escherichia coli was the most prevalent bacterium, followed by Morganella, Proteus, Shigella, Salmonella, Klebsiella and Aeromonas. Most of the isolated enterobacteria were opportunistic pathogens. Therefore, timely combination with antimicrobial agents is necessary for effective treatment of PRRS-infected pigs.","Zhao, Ge; Zhang, Lujie; Li, Charles; Zhao, Jianmei; Liu, Na; Li, Yuehua; Wang, Junwei; Liu, Liheng",Microb Pathog,,426

METHODS: All consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 11 to February 6, 2020, were included in this study. RESULTS: A total of 663 patients with COVID-19 were included, while 67 patients with T2DM accounted for 10.1% of the total. Compared with patients with COVID-19 without T2DM, those with T2DM were older (aged 66 years vs 57 years; P < 0.001) and had a male predominance (62.7% vs 37.3%; P = 0.019) and higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (61.2% vs 20.6%; P < 0.001) and urinary diseases (9% vs 2.5%; P = 0.014). Patients with T2DM were prone to developing severe (58.2% vs 46.3%; P = 0.002) and critical COVID-19 (20.9% vs 13.4%; P = 0.002) and having poor therapeutic effect (76.1% vs 60.4%; P = 0.017). But there was no obvious difference in the mortality between patients with COVID-19 with and without T2DM (4.5% vs 3.7%; P = 0.732). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified that T2DM was associated with poor therapeutic effect in patients with COVID-19 (odd ratio [OR] 2.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-8.66; P = 0.04). Moreover, having a severe and critical COVID-19 condition (OR 3.27; 95% CI, 1.02-9.00; P = 0.029) and decreased lymphocytes (OR 1.59; 95% CI, 1.10-2.34; P = 0.016) were independent risk factors associated with poor therapeutic effect in patients with COVID-19 with T2DM. CONCLUSIONS: T2DM influenced the disease severity and therapeutic effect and was one of the independent risk factors for poor therapeutic effect in patients with COVID-19.","Wang, Xiaoli; Liu, Zhengru; Li, Jiao; Zhang, Jixiang; Tian, Shan; Lu, Shimin; Qi, Mingming; Ma, Jingjing; Qiu, Bo; Dong, Weiguo; Xu, Yu",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,,426

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed using prospectively collected data. Survivors completed questionnaires assessing quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General and symptoms (Distress Thermometer, Patient's Disease and Treatment Assessment Form)). Survivors were assessed by a clinical psychologist for the presence of fear of cancer recurrence. Clinical and quality of life variables were evaluated for associations with fear of cancer recurrence. RESULTS: Overall, 315 survivors (181 breast cancer, 134 colorectal cancer) were included. In total, 201 survivors (64%) had fear of cancer recurrence according to psychology assessment, and of the 118 that had fear of cancer recurrence severity recorded, 64 (54%) were rated as moderate-severe. On univariate analysis, fear of cancer recurrence was associated with younger age (P < 0.001), higher distress thermometer score (P = 0.001) and poorer overall wellbeing (P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, younger age (P = 0.043), being bothered by side effects of treatment (P = 0.023), feeling sad (P = 0.020) and greater worry that their condition will get worse (P = 0.017) were independently associated with fear of cancer recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Fear of cancer recurrence is common in breast and colorectal cancer survivors, and moderate-severe in over half. Fear of cancer recurrence was independently associated with younger age, feeling sad, being more bothered by side effects.","Nahm, Sharon H; Blinman, Prunella; Butler, Sue; Tan, S Y Cindy; Vardy, Janette",Asia Pac. j. clin.oncol,,426
300476,Food Insecurity and Dietary Intake among Rural Indian Women: An Exploratory Study,2021,"The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus continually led to infect a large population worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes its NSP6 and Orf9c proteins to interact with sigma receptors that are implicated in lipid remodeling and ER stress response, to infect cells. The drugs targeting the sigma receptors, sigma-1 and sigma-2, have emerged as effective candidates to reduce viral infectivity, and some of them are in clinical trials against COVID-19. The antipsychotic drug, haloperidol, exerts remarkable antiviral activity, but, at the same time, the sigma-1 benzomorphan agonist, dextromethorphan, showed pro-viral activity. To explore the potential mechanisms of biased binding and activity of the two drugs, haloperidol and dextromethorphan towards NSP6, we herein utilized molecular docking-based molecular dynamics simulation studies. Our extensive analysis of the protein-drug interactions, structural and conformational dynamics, residual frustrations, and molecular switches of NSP6-drug complexes indicates that dextromethorphan binding leads to structural destabilization and increase in conformational dynamics and energetic frustrations. On the other hand, the strong binding of haloperidol leads to minimal structural and dynamical perturbations to NSP6. Thus, the structural insights of stronger binding affinity and favorable molecular interactions of haloperidol towards viral NSP6 suggests that haloperidol can be potentially explored as a candidate drug against COVID-19. KEY MESSAGES: â¢Inhibitors of sigma receptors are considered as potent drugs against COVID-19. â¢Antipsychotic drug, haloperidol, binds strongly to NSP6 and induces the minimal changes in structure and dynamics of NSP6. â¢Dextromethorphan, agonist of sigma receptors, binding leads to overall destabilization of NSP6. â¢These two drugs bind with NSP6 differently and also induce differences in the structural and conformational changes that explain their different mechanisms of action. â¢Haloperidol can be explored as a candidate drug against COVID-19.","Pandey, Preeti; Prasad, Kartikay; Prakash, Amresh; Kumar, Vijay",J Mol Med (Berl),,426
301761,The Early Stage of COVID-19 Outbreak in Greece: A Review of the National Response and the Socioeconomic Impact,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disproportionately impacted older individuals, those with lower educational attainment, and Black and Hispanic populations, yet vaccine hesitancy remains prevalent. Because widespread uptake of COVID-19 vaccines is critical to end the pandemic, addressing vaccine hesitancy is an important public health priority. Between April 1, 2020 and March 16, 2021, we have repeatedly surveyed a nationally representative online panel of adults and have tracked their stated likelihood of getting COVID-19 vaccinations. We present new evidence that in recent months disparities in self-reported likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination have narrowed by race/ethnicity, with an increasing proportion of Black individuals and Hispanic individuals indicating that they are likely to get a vaccine. At the same time, younger adults have progressively become less likely than older adults to state they will get a COVID-19 vaccine. Most vaccine-hesitant individuals are concerned about both vaccine efficacy and safety and do not trust the vaccine development or vaccine approval process. We conclude that outreach efforts to minority populations may be achieving their objectives in raising confidence in COVID-19 vaccines, but special outreach efforts are needed to address both vaccine hesitancy among younger adults and mistrust in the vaccine development and approval process.","Szilagyi, Peter G; Thomas, Kyla; Shah, Megha D; Vizueta, Nathalie; Cui, Yan; Vangala, Sitaram; Kapteyn, Arie",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,426
303480,Dietary Intake and Supplement Use Among Saudi Residents during COVID-19 Lockdown,2021,"BACKGROUND: Significant variation in disability-related social security benefits receipt might highlight sub-populations and groups with unmet needs and also have implications for areal indicators of disadvantage that are largely derived from uptake of benefits. In this paper we examine Disability Living Allowance (DLA), a non means-tested contribution towards disability-related living costs for disabled people aged less than sixty-five. METHOD: ology: Three census-based measures of self-reported health (number of chronic physical disabilities; activity limitation (a little; a lot); and chronic poor mental health) were linked to contemporaneous DLA records. The 2011 Census returns provided individual demographic, socio-economic, social and area-level characteristics. DLA uptake was modelled using logistic regression, stratified into 0-15 and 16-64 year old age groups. RESULTS: Overall, 118329 (8.4%) of this population received DLA. Poor health outcomes were the main determinants for uptake, which was higher amongst females, those non-married and those of lower socio-economic status: for example those with no qualifications compared against third level education (ORad = 1.80: 95%CI = 1.75-1.85); and those social renting compared against those in more expensive owner occupation (ORadj = 1.92: 1.83-2.02). Uptake was lower amongst Protestants than Catholics (ORadj = 0.75: 0.74-0.77) and amongst immigrants (ORadj = 0.36: 0.34-0.39) and slightly lower in rural communities. CONCLUSIONS: Poor health is the predominant determinant of disability benefits uptake but other social and socioeconomic factors have influence. These findings may assist in the reshaping of outreach programmes leading to better targeting of benefits, and therefore a more indirect influence on the derivation of area deprivation measures in the United Kingdom.","O039,; Reilly, Dermot; Rosato, Michael; Wright, David M; Millar, Ana Corina; Tseliou, Foteini; Maguire, Aideen",Soc Sci Med,,426

304657,Policy Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic in Vietnam,2021,"The recent outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus leading to the disease COVID 19, a global pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented loss of life and economy worldwide. Hence, there is an urgent need to discover effective drugs to control this pandemic. NSP16 is a methyltransferase that methylates the ribose 2'-O position of the viral nucleotide. Taking advantage of the recently solved structure of NSP16 with its inhibitor, S-Adenosylmethionine, we have virtually screened FDA approved drugs, drug candidates and natural compounds. The compounds with the best docking scores were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations followed by binding free energy calculations using the MM-PBSA method. The known drugs which were identified as potential inhibitors of NSP16 from SARS-CoV-2 included DB02498, DB03909, DB03186, Galuteolin, ZINC000029416466, ZINC000026985532, and ZINC000085537017. DB02498 (Carba-nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide) is an approved drug which has been used since the late 1960s in intravenous form to significantly lessen withdrawal symptoms from a variety of drugs and alcohol addicts and it has the best MM-PBSA binding free energy of-12.83 ± 0.52 kcal/mol. The second best inhibitor, Galuteolin is a natural compound that inhibits tyrosinase enzyme with MM-PBSA binding free energy value of -11.21 ± 0.47 kcal/mol. Detailed ligand and protein interactions were analyzed and common residues across SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV were identified. We propose Carba-nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide and Galuteolin as the potential inhibitors of NSP16. The results in this study can be used for the treatment of COVID-19 and can also form the basis of rational drug design against NSP16 of SARS-CoV-2.","Vijayan, Viswanathan; Pant, Pradeep; Vikram, Naval; Kaur, Punit; Singh, T P; Sharma, Sujata; Sharma, Pradeep",J Biomol Struct Dyn,,426

307456,Estimating Unreported COVID-19 Cases with a Time-Varying SIR Regression Model,2021,"High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is used to treat acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) even outside the ICU and the ROX index (pulse oximetry/fraction of inspired oxygen/respiratory rate) may predict HFNC failure. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this investigation was therefore to verify whether the ROX index is an accurate predictor of HFNC failure for COVID-19 patients treated outside the intensive care unit (ICU) and to evaluate the validity of the previously suggested threshold. DESIGN: Multicenter study. Retrospective observational analysis of prospectively collected data. SETTING: 3 centres specialized in non-invasive respiratory support (Buenos Aires, Argentina; Bolzano and Treviso, Italy). Patients treated outside the ICU were analysed MEASUREMENTS: The variables to calculate the ROX index were collected during the first day of therapy at 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours and then recorded every 24 hours. HFNC failure was defined as escalation of respiratory support to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or death. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 35 (29%) patients failed HFNC and required intubation. ROC analysis identified the 12-hour ROX index as the best predictor of intubation with an AUC of 0.7916[CI 95% 0.6905-0.8927] and the best threshold to be 5.99[Specificity 96% Sensitivity 62%]. In the survival analysis, a ROX value <5.99 was associated with an increased risk of failure (pâ¯=â¯0008â¯log - rank test). The threshold of 4,9 identified by Roca as the best predictor in non-COVID patients, was not able to discriminate between success and failure (pâ¯=â¯0.4â¯log-rank test) in our patients. CONCLUSIONS: ROX index may be useful in guiding the clinicians in their decision to intubate patients, especially in patients with moderate ARF, treated therefore outside the ICU. Indeed, it also demonstrates a different threshold value than reported for non-COVID patients, possibly related to the different mechanisms of hypoxia.","Vega, María Laura; Dongilli, Roberto; Olaizola, Gustavo; Colaianni, Nicolás; Sayat, Mauro Castro; Pisani, Lara; Romagnoli, Micaela; Spoladore, Greta; Prediletto, Irene; Montiel, Guillermo; Nava, Stefano","Pulmonology (Barc., Print)",,426
307567,"Machine and Deep Learning towards COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment: Survey, Challenges, and Future Directions",2021,"INTRODUCTION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, cancer patients have been regarded as having a high risk of severe events if they are infected with SARS-CoV-2, particularly those under medical or surgical treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the posttreatment risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in a population of patients operated on for colorectal cancer 3 months before the COVID-19 outbreak and who after hospitalization returned to an environment where the virus was circulating. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This French, multicenter cohort study included consecutive patients undergoing elective surgery for colorectal cancer between January 1 and March 31, 2020, at 19 GRECCAR hospitals. The outcome was the rate of COVID-19 infection in this group of patients who were followed until June 15, 2020. RESULTS: This study included 448 patients, 262 male (58.5%) and 186 female (41.5%), who underwent surgery for colon cancer (n = 290, 64.7%), rectal cancer (n = 155, 34.6%), or anal cancer (n = 3, 0.7%). The median age was 68 years (19-95). Comorbidities were present in nearly half of the patients, 52% were at least overweight, and the median BMI was 25 (12-42). At the end of the study, 448 were alive. Six patients (1.3%) developed COVID-19 infection; among them, 3 were hospitalized in the conventional ward, and none of them died. CONCLUSION: The results are reassuring, with only a 1.3% infection rate and no deaths related to COVID-19. We believe that we can operate on colorectal cancer patients without additional mortality from COVID-19, applying all measures aimed at reducing the risk of infection.","Tuech, Jean-Jacques; Manceau, Gilles; Ouaissi, Mehdi; Denet, Christine; Chau, Amélie; Kartheuser, Alex; Desfourneaux, Véronique; Duchalais, Emilie; Bertrand, Martin; Badic, Bogdan; Alves, Arnaud; Ceribelli, Cecilia; Venara, Aurelien; Mege, Diane; Mauvais, François; Dumont, Fréderic; Mabrut, Jean-Yves; Lakkis, Zaher; Cotte, Eddy; Meillat, Helene",Int J Colorectal Dis,,426

Patients present with various symptoms, including extra-pulmonary manifestations. However, manifestations on adrenal glands have not been reported extensively. Here, we present a case of functional adrenal insufficiency in a COVID-19 patient. A 61-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia presented with fatigue, cough, and dyspnea, subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. His blood pressure (BP) on admission was 128/68 mmHg with 86% oxygen saturation on room air. Dexamethasone 6mg daily was started for ten days. Remdesivir was contra-indicated, considering the ALT of 246 and AST of 248. On day seven of hospitalization, he had progressively worsening respiratory symptoms and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit with BP of 105/63 mmHg. Within 48 hours, he showed positive orthostatic vitals with BP of 85/54 mmHg. Despite intravenous hydration, his BP was consistently low on subsequent days with 88/53 mmHg and 99/66 mmHg. His serum total cortisol level was 9.2 μg/dL, and he showed a positive response to IV Hydrocortisone 50mg as well as oral prednisone 10 mg the following day. We did not obtain a cosyntropin stimulation test because of recent corticosteroid therapy. Midodrine 2.5mg three times daily (TID) was started, then increased to 10 mg to maintain BP and alleviate orthostatic symptoms. However, symptomatic positive orthostatic vitals were persistent. He was discharged on midodrine 7.5 mg TID and Fludrocortisone 0.1 mg daily for suspicion of functional adrenal insufficiency. Additionally, a HDL level of 22 mg/dL was recorded (vs 56 mg/dL six months ago). At three months follow-up, he was off fludrocortisone and midodrine with improved orthostatic symptoms. Hypotension and orthostatic symptoms in COVID-19 could be due to IL-1, IL-6, or tumor necrosis factor-mediated reduction in ACTH secretion. Acute illnesses, including COVID-19, may also increase cortisol demand, causing adrenal insufficiency. Decreased HDL noted in our patient could be another etiology. ""Critical Illness-Related Corticosteroid Insufficiency"" (CIRCI) is a functional adrenal insufficiency that is not strictly dependent on cortisol level for diagnosis but mostly on the inadequacy of cortisol for inflammation control or supplying the raised metabolic demand. Decreased cortisol complex cleavage, increased activity of an enzyme responsible for cortisol inactivation, and decreased numbers and affinity of cortisol receptors were postulated to play a role. Therefore, adrenal insufficiency as a cause of hypotension following COVID-19 infection should not be overlooked despite normal cortisol levels.","Ahmed, M.

The rapid and global spread of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Earlier during the pandemic, there were limited genetic viral variations. As millions of people became infected, multiple single amino acid substitutions emerged. Many of these substitutions have no consequences. However, some of the new variants show a greater infection rate, more severe disease, and reduced sensitivity to current prophylaxes and treatments. Of particular importance in SARS-CoV-2 transmission are mutations that occur in the Spike (S) protein, the protein on the viral outer envelope that binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor (hACE2). Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of 441,168 individual virus sequences isolated from humans throughout the world. From the individual sequences, we identified 3540 unique amino acid substitutions in the S protein. Analysis of these different variants in the S protein pinpointed important functional and structural sites in the protein. This information may guide the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics to help arrest the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pokhrel, Suman; Kraemer, Benjamin R; Burkholz, Scott; Mochly-Rosen, Daria",Sci Rep,,426

Sustainability indicators are tools that have proven to be a successful aid in defining and creating system boundaries. This paper focuses on the development of sustainability indicators for Arctic tourism, with a special emphasis on the role of public participation in their determination. It presents a stakeholder-centric approach to indicator selection by developing a framework that effectively integrates public participation in the processes of indicators’ selection and designation, and highlights the importance of combining local and expert knowledge in these processes. The results reveal that the making of sustainability indicators is an ideal platform for local voices to be heard, and thus to have a significant stake in the overall process of tourism development. The most effective way to make their voices heard in the final decision-making process is via their evaluation of the adaptability and prioritization of these indicators. The results, furthermore, stress that sustainability indicators need to be constantly re-evaluated and updated, as tourism is part of a complex and dynamic system that is constantly changing. To provide a holistic vision of the impact of economic, environmental, and social factors, as well as the causality between them in the system, sustainability indicators must be integrated from many indicators. Since the monitoring of conventional indicators is often less complicated and more cost-effective than the monitoring of integrated indicators, a better result can however be reached by combining conventional indicators with sustainability indicators.","Ólafsdóttir, Rannveig",Sustainability,,426

316687,Exploring Perceived Stress among Students in Turkey during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) patients frequently develop QT interval prolongation that predisposes them to Torsades de Pointes and sudden cardiac death. Continuous cardiac monitoring has been recommended for any COVID-19 patient with a Tisdale Score of seven or more. This recommendation, however, has not been validated. METHODS: We included 178 COVID-19 patients admitted to a non-intensive care unit setting of a tertiary academic medical center. A receiver operating characteristics curve was plotted to determine the accuracy of the Tisdale Score to predict QT interval prolongation. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify additional predictors. RESULTS: The area under the curve of the Tisdale Score was 0.60 (CI 95%, 0.46-0.75). Using the cutoff of seven to stratify COVID-19, patients had a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 7.6%. Risk factors independently associated with QT interval prolongation included a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (OR, 6.42; CI 95%, 1.28-32.13), QTc &#8805;450 ms on admission (OR, 5.90; CI 95%, 1.62-21.50), and serum potassium &#8804;3.5 mmol/L during hospitalization (OR, 4.97; CI 95%, 1.51-16.36). CONCLUSION: The Tisdale Score is not a useful tool to stratify hospitalized non-critical COVID-19 patients based on their risks of developing QT interval prolongation. Clinicians should initiate continuous cardiac monitoring for patients who present with a history of ESRD, QTc &#8805;450 ms on admission or serum potassium &#8804;3.5 mmol/L.","Zhao, Wei; Gandhi, Nikhil; Affas, Saif; Szpunar, Susan; Mesiha, Nancy; Saravolatz, Louis",Ann Noninvasive Electrocardiol,,426

However, restricted economic activities have also contributed towards a cleaner environment. However, environmental changes are not permanent, and the pollution level may rise again in the future. As a result, current research suggests that policymakers must introduce stringent environmental policies to promote clean energy.","Bashir, Muhammad Farhan; Ma, Benjiang; Shahzad, Luqman",Air Qual Atmos Health,,426

325304,Food Acquisition and Daily Life for U.S. Families with 4-to 8-Year-Old Children during COVID-19: Findings from a Nationally Representative Survey,2021,"The development of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) deaths in selected nations and states is compared to the result of calculations using a conventional SEIR model of pandemic development. The model is based on the infection multiplier, R0, defined as the number of people infected by each infectious person. The infection rate increases exponentially when R0 >1.0; it remains constant at R0 = 1.0 and decreases for R0 < 1.0. R0 is determined by population behavior (frequency and proximity of interactions) and the ease by which a victim is infected by an infectious person (virulence of the virus). It is reduced by herd immunity when a large fraction of the population acquires immunity by vaccination or by recovering from infection. The daily death rates in the U.S. and northern Europe exhibited peaks in April/May 2020 and Dec. 2020/Jan. 2021 with more a modest rate during the summer of 2020 and a gradually decreasing rate since Jan. 2021. The model produces this type of oscillatory response if it assumes that the populations R0 responds to information reported about the pandemic, but with a delay between infections and resulting behavioral adjustments. Oscillatory behavior is typical of a control loop with delay in its feedback. The analysis concludes thatO_QDGiven the history of R0 the model predicts the development of pandemic deaths. However, since R0 is determined by the populations behavior, control of the pandemic in democracies depends primarily on preparation and the persuasive power of political and scientific authorities. Data for S. Korea and New Zealand demonstrate the effectiveness of such methods. For each death in the U.S. about 169 persons were infected, but fewer than half of them were identified as cases. The pandemic was prolonged in the U.S. because the population chose to keep R0 near 1.0 by relaxing restrictions once the death rate subsided. Initial values of R0 as high as 5.0 were observed, leading to infections doubling about every 2 days. If unabated, the resulting exponential growth increases the infected population by a factor of about 5000 before the death from the first infections is recorded. Arrival from Italy probably initiated the pandemic in the eastern U.S., but, by the time the first death was recorded the number of domestic infections exceeded by far those that were imported. Import restrictions beyond this point are ineffective except in delaying the arrival of more virulent mutations. If no social restrictions had been adopted, approximately 1.6 million deaths would have resulted in the U.S. The vaccine, although developed and deployed at record speed, was too late to ameliorate this result. A third peak in death rate in Sept. 2021 may be prevented if more than 80% of the population is vaccinated. C_QD","Lint, Victor A.J. van",,,426

Comparing respondents' answers about their most fundamental aspects of life during and after the pandemic, including income level, expenditure structure and level, purchase method, study method, food price and quality, and dining habit, both the descriptive and econometric models reveal that Chinese consumers' life patterns were not significantly changed. These findings may imply a ""new normal"" where consumers stick to their new living habits that were forged during the pandemic. Therefore, policy makers have to envisage such an implicative socio-economic change (cost) brought by the implementation of a lock down policy in a long run, in addition to direct and explicit economic losses. However, improving food quality and controlling food price appear to be the strong and stable safety signals to reassure consumers in this complicated environment.","Yuan, Xiaoling; Li, Caijuan; Zhao, Kai; Xu, Xiaoyu",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,426
330953,Impact of Covid-19 Lockdown on Availability of Drinking Water in the Arsenic-Affected Ganges River Basin,2021,"The discrepancies in our food systems have become more pronounced in the last couple of years due to natural disasters of huge magnitude and the current pandemic, that have served to make them visible to a wider range of population. As a result, a shift to agroecological food and farming systems is currently being advocated at different levels. An agroecological approach to food systems involves consideration of all their interactions with the major challenges of our time—food security, water scarcity, climate change, socioeconomic disparity. This paper presents a bibliometric study of peer reviewed literature about the role of agroecology in relation to either or all of these challenges, published between 1990 and 2020. 1990 was the year in which IPCC published its first assessment report that set into motion many framework agreements and protocols regarding climate change. In 2019 and 2020, IPBES and iPES-Food released separate reports advocating an urgent agricultural transition based on agroecological methodologies. There has been an exponential increase in the published research in this field in this time period, whereas an overwhelming majority of the publications were filed under the subject areas of agricultural and biological sciences, environmental sciences, and social sciences. In addition to the increasing acceptance of the role of agroecology to address the challenges of our times, the results of this analysis point to the cross-cutting nature of issues agroecology caters to.","Tasawwar, Sumbal Otterpohl Ralf",Sustainability,,426

Early sequencing of the viral genome and knowledge from past coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS) has led to rapid advances in knowledge of how the virus spreads and infects human hosts. Unfortunately, advancing knowledge has not yet produced a treatment that substantially lowers morbidity or mortality and only recently resulted in the development of a vaccine that prevents severe disease. Mounting evidence supports the notion that dietary supplementation of key essential nutrients may contribute to the body's defenses against infection as well as bolster the body's responses to infection. Evidence supporting the potential beneficial roles of vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, and B3 vitamins is reviewed here, revealing a combination of basic research elucidating underlying mechanisms of action, preclinical studies and human intervention studies has led to the proliferation of registered clinical trials on COVID-19. Overall, the data suggest this collection of nutrients has a promising impact on reducing the risk and/or severity of COVID-19, although firm conclusions await the results of these trials.","Bogan-Brown, Katrina; Nkrumah-Elie, Yasmeen; Ishtiaq, Yusrah; Redpath, Philip; Shao, Andrew",J Diet Suppl,,426
332958,Associations between Relationship Quality and Mental Health during COVID-19 in the United Kingdom,2021,"Sensing of pathogens by specialized receptors is the hallmark of the innate immunity. Innate immune response also mounts a defense response against various allergens and pollutants including particulate matter present in the atmosphere. Air pollution has been included as the top threat to global health declared by WHO which aims to cover more than three billion people against health emergencies from 2019 to 2023. Particulate matter (PM), one of the major components of air pollution, is a significant risk factor for many human diseases and its adverse effects include morbidity and premature deaths throughout the world. Several clinical and epidemiological studies have identified a key link between the PM existence and the prevalence of respiratory and inflammatory disorders. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is not well understood. Here, we investigated the influence of air pollutant, PM10 (particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 µm) during RNA virus infections using Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) - H5N1 virus. We thus characterized the transcriptomic profile of lung epithelial cell line, A549 treated with PM10 prior to H5N1infection, which is known to cause severe lung damage and respiratory disease. We found that PM10 enhances vulnerability (by cellular damage) and regulates virus infectivity to enhance overall pathogenic burden in the lung cells. Additionally, the transcriptomic profile highlights the connection of host factors related to various metabolic pathways and immune responses which were dysregulated during virus infection. Collectively, our findings suggest a strong link between the prevalence of respiratory illness and its association with the air quality.","Mishra, Richa; Krishnamoorthy, Pandikannan; Gangamma, S; Raut, Ashwin Ashok; Kumar, Himanshu",Environ Pollut,,426

340420,Physical Activity in Adolescents with and without Type 1 Diabetes during the New Zealand COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown of 2020,2021,"INTRODUCTION: While the current COVID-19 pandemic has affected the lives of many, there is a paucity of information on the impact on people with multiple sclerosis (MS). This study sought to gain insight into the impact of the current situation on people with MS and the factors that influence this. METHODS: 324 MS patients participated in this online cross-sectional survey during the COVID-19 lockdown period. A mixed methods design was used, with quantitative information collected on MS-related factors as well as COVID-19 impact and an open-ended, qualitative response looking for reasons behind the self-reported COVID-19 impact. RESULTS: We found that 48% of the participants reported that COVID-19 had a neutral impact on their lives and 16% reported a positive impact. However, 36% reported a negative impact, and had greater levels of MS- and non-MS-related worries, and higher levels of bother related to psychological and cognitive symptoms and fatigue than the groups reporting a neutral or positive impact. Significant predictors of this adversely affected group were age, type of MS and presence of psychological symptoms. Antidepressant medication use, time since diagnosis, gender, location, living arrangements or employment status did not predict impact. Open-ended responses explaining personal COVID-19 impact indicate that coping strategies may contribute to these findings. In particular, active, problem-focused approaches were reported by the majority of people who reported a positive impact, as well as a third of those who reported a neutral impact. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that younger people, those with progressive types of MS, and those with psychological symptoms are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of a COVID-19 pandemic induced lockdown. Coping strategies provide further insight into these findings with those reporting active problem-focused approaches seemingly faring better than those who do not state any coping strategies. These results also have implications for understanding other like neurological conditions that share many similarities with MS and how best to direct support.","Morris-Bankole, Hannah; Ho, Aileen K",Neurol Ther,,426
340421,Physical Activity in Adolescents with and without Type 1 Diabetes during the New Zealand COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown of 2020,2021,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the mental health status, stressors and self-adjustment of nurses in isolation wards at different periods in Wuhan, China. BACKGROUND: Mental health issues easily occurred among the frontline medical workers of a major epidemic. However, the stressors and psychological adjustments experienced by nurses have not been well described. This is crucial to improving clinical quality and nursing safety and ensuring nurses' physical and psychological health. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional prospective study using the Self Reporting Questionnaire-20, stressor and self-adjustment questionnaire administered to frontline nurses in Wuhan at two time points: after they had worked in isolation wards for 7-10 days (T1 ) and 2 months (T2 ). This paper complies with the STROBE reporting guideline for cross-sectional studies. RESULTS: T1 has 92 respondents, and T2 has 86. The positive rates of mental health problems were 26.09% and 9.30%, respectively, showing significantly different in the two periods. The main factors influenced mental health were self-perceived stress and only child status. The most common stressors were as follows: a large infected population, high infectivity; concerned about family's health status; high mortality if not treated in time (T1 ); and long duration of the epidemic, separate from family for a long time (T2 ). In terms of self-adjustment, 97.83%(T1 )/88.04%(T2 ) of nurses thought it was necessary, but 9(T1 ) /5(T2 ) chose to avoid addressing it, and 8(T1 ) /5(T2 ) utilised a professional psychological counselling hotline. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health problems among frontline nurses fighting COVID-19 need special attention, so administrators should offer timely counselling and strengthen effective psychosocial support to improve their mental resilience. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study surveyed the mental problems and self-adjustment status among nurses working Wuhan during the outbreak of COVID-19, to provide administrators with a scientific basis to effectively intervene.","Chen, Huijuan; Sun, Libing; Du, Zhe; Zhao, Liting; Wang, Ling",J. clin. nurs,,426

344832,"One Month into the Reinforcement of Social Distancing due to the COVID-19 Outbreak: Subjective Health, Health Behaviors, and Loneliness among People with Chronic Medical Conditions",2020,"Newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has caused extensive mortality and morbidity and wreaked havoc on socioeconomic structures. The urgent need to better understand SARS-CoV-2 biology and enable continued development of effective countermeasures is aided by the production of laboratory tools that facilitate SARS-CoV-2 research. We previously created a directly accessible SARS-CoV-2 toolkit containing user-friendly reverse genetic (RG) infectious clones of SARS-CoV-2. Here, using K18-human ACE2 (hACE2) mice, we confirmed the validity of RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 viruses to reproduce the infection profile, clinical disease, and pathogenesis already established in mice infected with natural SARS-CoV-2 isolates, often patient derived. RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice developed substantial clinical disease and weight loss by day 6 postinfection. RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 was recovered from the lungs and brains of infected K18-hACE2 mice, and infection resulted in viral pneumonia with considerable changes in lung pathology, as seen previously with natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. In mice infected with RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2-mCherry, mCherry was detected in areas of lung consolidation and colocalized with clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2-assocated immunopathology. RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 viruses successfully recapitulated many of the features of severe COVID-19 associated with the K18-hACE2 model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. With utility in vivo, the RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 viruses will be valuable resources to advance numerous areas of SARS-CoV-2 basic research and COVID-19 vaccine development.IMPORTANCE To develop COVID-19 countermeasures, powerful research tools are essential. We produced a SARS-COV-2 reverse genetic (RG) infectious clone toolkit that will benefit a variety of investigations. In this study, we further prove the toolkit's value by demonstrating the in vivo utility of RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 isolates. RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 isolates reproduce disease signs and pathology characteristic of the K18-hACE2 mouse model of severe COVID-19 in infected mice.

As part of the 'digital government response to COVID-19,' the Government of Canada launched the 'Canada COVID-19 Alert' app in June 2020. This cellphone/tablet-based app aims to use Bluetooth technology to notify users of potential exposures to COVID-19. Despite reports that over 40 such apps have been implemented worldwide, evaluations of the government's intended aims, the extent to which those aims are realized through these tools, and the implications of their usage are missing. Objective This study undertakes a rapid qualitative assessment of the Canada COVID-19 app during the first phase of its development and implementation (May-October 2020). Methods Three qualitative methods are employed: 1) Review of government website and available documentary materials to assess intended aims. 2) Walkthrough of the app to assess the extend to which the intended aims might be accomplished. 3) Analysis of Canadian newspaper coverage to assess the societal implications of app usage. Critical analyses are guided by asking: for what ends, for whom, by whom, and under which circumstances can the app operate as intended. Rapid assessment focuses on the role and balance of evidence-, needs-, and/or technology-driven justifications, and of public healthand/ or government-oriented goals and functions. Results Preliminary analyses indicate that the app's aims remain elusive. It serves a limited potential proximity notification role, rather than a contact tracing aim. Debates about data privacy and storage concerns indicate scepticism and mistrust of the app. Profit (re)distribution and tool de-implementation plans amid an unlikely clear-cut pandemic 'end' remain absent. Conclusions In a time which trust in public health measures are essential for the control of communicable disease, the tools employed must be assessed. Only through critical scrutiny can new tools stand up to benefit the public good.","Gómez-Ramírez, O.; Medeiros, P.; Wainer, R.; Iyamu, I.",BMJ Open,,426

Its course in many features resembles that of acute rheumatic fever (ARF). Therefore, it is interesting that the experiences with ARF can be used in the management of patients with PIMS-TS. The aim of the article is to analyse the current data on PIMS-TS in relation to ARF. PIMS-TS and ARF are associated with an abnormal immune response to specific pathogens (SARS-CoV-2 and group A streptococcus, respectively). The main symptoms of both diseases are fever and cardiac involvement. Current therapy for PIMS-TS is based on anti-inflammatory treatment: intravenous immunoglobulin (first-line), intravenous glucocorticoids (second-line), or biological therapy (third-line;including interleukin [IL]-1 antagonists, IL-6 receptor blockers, and anti-tumour necrosis factor agents). Vaccination might be good prophylaxis, but the efficacy and safety of the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been established in children. Interesting insights may be gained by considering PIMS-TS in light of what is known of ARF due to their similar courses, but there are still many unanswered questions surrounding this disease and its pathogenesis.","Opoka-Winiarska, V.; Grywalska, E.; Rolinski, J.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,426

Since the first case appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the outbreak has gradually spread nationwide. Up to now, according to official data released by the Chinese health commission, the number of newly diagnosed patients has been declining, and the epidemic is gradually being controlled. Although most patients have mild symptoms and good prognosis after infection, some patients developed severe and die from multiple organ complications. The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans remains unclear. Immune function is a strong defense against invasive pathogens and there is currently no specific antiviral drug against the virus. This article reviews the immunological changes of coronaviruses like SARS, MERS and other viral pneumonia similar to SARS-CoV-2. Combined with the published literature, the potential pathogenesis of COVID-19 is inferred, and the treatment recommendations for giving high-doses intravenous immunoglobulin and low-molecular-weight heparin anticoagulant therapy to severe type patients are proposed.","Lin, Ling; Lu, Lianfeng; Cao, Wei; Li, Taisheng",Emerg Microbes Infect,,426

This study aimed to characterize general sleep status among Chinese residents during the early stage of the outbreak and to explore the network relationship among COVID-19 uncertainty, intolerance of uncertainty, perceived stress, and sleep status. METHODS: A cross-sectional correlational survey was conducted online. A total of 2534 Chinese residents were surveyed from 30 provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions of China and regions abroad during the period from February 7 to 14, 2020, the third week of lockdown. Final valid data from 2215 participants were analyzed. Self-report measures assessed uncertainty about COVID-19, intolerance of uncertainty, perceived stress, and general sleep status. Serial mediation analysis using the bootstrapping method and path analysis were applied to test the mediation role of intolerance of uncertainty and perceived stress in the relationship between uncertainty about COVID-19 and sleep status. RESULTS: The total score of sleep status was 4.82 (SD = 2.72). Age, place of residence, ethnicity, marital status, infection, and quarantine status were all significantly associated with general sleep status. Approximately half of participants (47.1%) reported going to bed after 12:00 am, 23.0% took 30 min or longer to fall asleep, and 30.3% slept a total of 7 h or less. Higher uncertainty about COVID-19 was significantly positively correlated with higher intolerance of uncertainty (r = 0.506, p < 0.001). The mediation analysis found a mediating role of perceived stress in the relationship between COVID-19 uncertainty and general sleep status (ß = 0.015, 95%C.I. = 0.009-0.021). However, IU was not a significant mediator of the relationship between COVID-19 uncertainty and sleep (ß = 0.009, 95%C.I. = - 0.002-0.020). Moreover, results from the path analysis further showed uncertainty about COVID-19 had a weak direct effect on poor sleep (ß = 0.043, p < 0.05); however, there was a robust indirect effect on poor sleep through intolerance of uncertainty and perceived stress. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that intolerance of uncertainty and perceived stress are critical factors in the relationship between COVID-19 uncertainty and sleep outcomes. Results are discussed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and practical policy implications are also provided.","Wu, Dan; Yang, Tingzhong; Hall, Daniel L; Jiao, Guihua; Huang, Lixin; Jiao, Can",BMC Psychiatry,,426

The regulatory mechanism of YAP in Hippo-low contexts is poorly understood. Here, we performed a genome-wide RNA interference screen to identify genes whose loss of function in a Hippo-null background affects YAP activity. We discovered that the coatomer protein complex I (COPI) is required for YAP nuclear enrichment and that COPI dependency of YAP confers an intrinsic vulnerability to COPI disruption in YAP-driven cancer cells. We identified MAP2K3 as a YAP regulator involved in inhibitory YAP phosphorylation induced by COPI subunit depletion. The endoplasmic reticulum stress response pathway activated by COPI malfunction appears to connect COPI and MAP2K3. In addition, we provide evidence that YAP inhibition by COPI disruption may contribute to transcriptional up-regulation of PTGS2 and proinflammatory cytokines. Our study offers a resource for investigating Hippo-independent YAP regulation as a therapeutic target for cancers and suggests a link between YAP and COPI-associated inflammatory diseases.","Kim, Yong Joon; Jung, Eunji; Shin, Eunbie; Hong, Sin-Hyoung; Jeong, Hui Su; Hur, Gayeong; Jeong, Hye Yun; Lee, Seung-Hyo; Lee, Ji Eun; Kim, Gun-Hwa; Kim, Joon",Proc.

Taking a vitamin D supplement reduced the risk of having ARI. Non-ICU in-patients in our hospital with a vitamin D deficiency were supplemented with vitamin D. Methods and procedures From March to May 2020, data of non-ICU patients with Covid-19 infection were collected at discharge. Vitamin D serum levels were assessed at admission and correlated to age, sex, Body Mass Index (BMI), length of stay (LOS) and discharge outcome. Mean and standard deviation or percentage were calculated for all data. Results Vitamin D serum level was assessed at admission in n. 97 non-ICU patients. Most of them (80%) have a deficiency of vitamin D (&lt; 20 ng/mL), median age is 63,7 years, 71% are men, mean BMI is 26,5, median LOS is 13,6 days (Table 1) and above 25% have a worse discharge outcome (sub-ICU, ICU or death) as shown in Table 2. Patients with a sub-obtimal vitamin D level are 14%, mostly female (64%), with a lower mean BMI (24,8), mean LOS of 15,4 days and a worse discharge outcome in 14% of cases. Only 5 patients have a sufficient vitamin D serum level, mean age of 61,2 years, mean BMI of 24,6, mean LOS of 9,2 and home discharge outcome for all of them. Conclusion Low vitamin D levels seem to correlate with a higher risk of developing the disease;supplementation of vitamin D may help in reducing the risk of ARI and improving outcome.","Mascheroni, A.; Cremonesi, I.; Merelli, E.; Misotti, A.

Unfortunately, there are still no approved drugs for either the treatment or the prevention of COVID-19. Many studies have focused on repurposing established antimalarial therapies, especially those that showed prior efficacy against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, against COVID-19 combined with azithromycin. These classes of drugs potentially induce prolongation of the QT interval, which might lead to lethal arrhythmia. Beta-blockers, as a beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) antagonist, can prevent an increase in the sympathetic tone, which is the most important arrhythmia trigger. In this literature review, we aimed to find the effect of administering azithromycin, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine on cardiac rhythm disorders and our findings show that bisoprolol, as a cardio-selective beta-blocker, is effective for the management of the QT (i.e., the start of the Q wave to the end of the T wave) interval prolongation in COVID-19 patients.","Heriansyah, T.; Chomsy, I.

MethodsTo characterize the vaccine uptake among U.S. child care providers, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of the child care workforce. Providers were identified through various national databases and state registries. A link to the survey was sent via email between May 26 and June 23, 2021. Out of 44,771 potential respondents, 21,663 responded (48.4%). ResultsOverall COVID-19 vaccine uptake among U.S. child care providers (78.1%, 95% CI [77.3% to 78.9%]) was higher than that of the U.S. adult population (65%). Vaccination rates varied from 53.5% to 89.4% between states. Vaccine uptake differed significantly (p < .01) based on respondent age (70.0% for ages 25-34, 91.5% for ages 75-84), race (70.0% for Black or African Americans, 92.5% for Asian-Americans), annual household income (70.7% for <$35,000, 85.0% for>$75,000), and childcare setting (72.9% for home-based, 79.7% for center-based).

365944,French Public Familiarity and Attitudes toward Clinical Research during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Boredom in adolescence is often underestimated, although it may be the sign of a profound unease or be associated with psychological disorders Given the complexity of the construct of boredom and its increasing prevalence among adolescents in recent years, the present study aimed to validate the factorial structure of the Italian version of the Multidimensional State Boredom Scale (MSBS) in adolescents using a cross-validation approach The study involved 272 students (33 8% males, 66 2% females) aged 14–19 (M = 15 9, SD = 1 38) living in northern and central Italy In addition to the MSBS, the Symptoms Checklist 90-R (SCL 90-R) and the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) were administered Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses validated a 23-item structure of the MSBS, comprising five correlated factors The tool showed a good internal consistency for these factors and a good convergent and factor validity The MSBS consequently seems a valid and reliable method for assessing boredom in adolescence The cut-off for the total score that could pinpoint cases posing a potential clinical risk was 88 A weak correlation was found between the total level of boredom and the daily Internet usage, while no relationship emerged between boredom and age, gender, and grades Since excessive levels of boredom may conceal a general unease that could develop into structured psychological disorders, the value of the MSBS lies in enabling us to identify in advance adolescents at potential clinical risk","Spoto, Andrea Iannattone Sara Valentini Perla Raffagnato Alessia Miscioscia Marina Gatta Michela",Children,,426
366006,Parental Involvement in Children's Sleep Care and Nocturnal Awakenings in Infants and Toddlers,2020,"With the implementation of the new Kidney Allocation System (KAS), there is increased reliance on a virtual crossmatch/histocompatibility risk assessment (vXM) for evaluating potential presence, as well as strength, of HLA antibodies against a potential donor. The accuracy of such an assessment depends on the precision in the identification of the recipient's antibody profile and the potential donor's HLA typing. While the development of the single antigen bead (SAB) multiplex assay has improved the sensitivity and specificity of HLA-antibody detection, several limitations of the assay (specific to certain sensitized patients) can complicate accurate interpretation of results. In this report, we focus on the ""shared-epitope"" phenomenon, a condition in which antibody strength can be underrepresented, or its presence completely missed, due to binding of the antibody to competing targets on multiple antigens (beads), effectively ""diluting"" the resulting MFI-readout. Here, we provide a relevant background to understand this phenomenon and present a couple of case studies illustrating how it can be investigated, leading to a more accurate histocompatibility consultation.","Garcia-Sanchez, Cynthia; Usenko, Crystal Y; Herrera, Nancy D; Tambur, Anat R",Clin Transplant,,426

370736,Depressive Symptoms in Swiss University Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Correlates,2021,"Chordomas are rare, locally aggressive bone malignancies with poor prognoses. However, those with minimal or no bone involvement are more easily resectable because of their well-delineated margins and thus have better prognoses. Such extraosseous chordomas of the spine are localized both intradurally and extradurally. Only a few case reports have focused on extraosseous, extradural spinal chordomas. Radiologically, this type of chordoma has a dumbbell shape; however, dumbbell-shaped spinal tumors are traditionally thought to be neurogenic tumors (i.e., schwannomas or neurofibromas). We herein report a unique case involving a woman with a dumbbell-shaped extraosseous chordoma protruding predominantly into the retropharyngeal space. A 44-year-old woman presented for evaluation of a left submandibular mass. A T2-hyperintense, gadolinium-enhancing mass was found in her cervical spinal canal, protruding through the C2/3 neural foramen into the retropharyngeal space with minimal vertebral involvement. The initial diagnosis was a neurogenic tumor, most likely a schwannoma. After subtotal removal, the pathologic diagnosis was a chordoma. Because chordomas and schwannomas have significantly different prognoses, caution is warranted when a dumbbell-shaped tumor is identified in the spine with minimal or no vertebral deterioration on radiology. This report also provides the first thorough review of extraosseous dumbbell-shaped intraspinal-extraspinal chordomas.","Lee, Sun Joo; Paeng, Sung Hwa; Kang, Mi Seon; Jung, Soo Jin; Yoon, Shin Ae; Park, Ha Young; Yoon, Hye Kyoung; Yang, Young Il; Cho, Hwa Jin",J Int Med Res,,426

Due to the rapid increase in the counts of COVID cases, the WHO declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Among the different screening techniques available for COVID-19, radiography of the chest is one of the efficient way for disease detection. While other disease detection techniques take time, radiography takes less time to identify because of the abnormalities caused by the disease in the lungs. Methods: In the rapid development era of artificial intelligence and deep-learning techniques, various models are being developed for COVID disease detection. COVID-19 can be easily detected from Chest X-ray images and the pretrained models yield high accuracy with small dataset. Results: In this paper, one of the standard deep-learning architectures, VGGNet, is modified for classifying chest X-ray images under four categories. The proposed model uses open source dataset that contains 231, 2503, 1345, and 1341 images of four classes such as COVID, bacterial, normal, and viral chest radiography images, respectively. Conclusion: The performance matrices of the proposed work were compared with the five benchmark deep-learning architectures namely VGGNet, AlexNet, GoogLeNET, Inception-v4, and DenseNet-201. © This is an open access journal, and articles are distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 License.","Anand, R.; Sowmya, V.; Menon, V.; Gopalakrishnan, A.; Soman, K.

Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ulcerative colitis (UC), and polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis. To date, data on tofacitinib treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic are limited. Objectives: To summarize current understanding of the use of tofacitinib in adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, and discuss research questions that are yet to be addressed, in order to further inform the safe and effective use of tofacitinib in clinical practice. Methods: We conducted a review of the literature (as of February 2021), in order to summarize the expert recommendations for the management of RA, PsA, and UC in the context of COVID-19, and to assess the current data regarding the use of tofacitinib in adult patients during the pandemic. Results: Current recommendations for RA, PsA, and UC state that tofacitinib treatment should be continued during the pandemic, except in cases of positive or presumed SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, limited data are available; analyses of data from international rheumatology and gastroenterology registries have suggested that tofacitinib may not be associated with an increased risk of hospitalization or treatment switching in adults with COVID-19. Conclusions: Further assessment of tofacitinib use in patients with RA, PsA, or UC will be required to elucidate and establish the benefit:risk profile of tofacitinib during the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Howland, Samantha; Deuring, J Jasper; Zhou, Xiaofeng; Yan, Chen; Mota, Licia Mh; Ungaro, Ryan C",Curr Ther Res Clin Exp,,426

379210,Swiss University Students' Risk Perception and General Anxiety during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"So far, available evidence suggests that patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are not at greater risk for developing COVID-19 infection. In regard to patients with IBD remission: 5-aminosalycylates (5-ASAs) do not increase the risk for infection and should be continued. There is no need to suspend them or lower the dose. Immunomodulating drugs, such as thiopurines and methotrexate, should be continued, without modifying doses (even in patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 infection). No type of biologic therapy should be suspended, unless there are signs of COVID-19. Regarding patients with IBD activity: the oral and/or topical 5-ASA dose should be optimized in cases of disease relapse. Budesonide MMX should be considered in cases of mild-to-moderate activity, to avoid systemic steroid use. Systemic steroids should be avoided whenever possible because doses above 20mg per day have an immunosuppressive effect, which could increase susceptibility to any type of infection, including COVID-19. The combined use of thiopurines with steroids and/or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) monoclonal antibodies should also be avoided because those combinations can increase the risk for infections, including COVID-19. Finally, biologic treatment with anti-TNF-alpha agents or any other mechanism of action, such as anti-integrins or anti-interleukins, should be suspended if patients become infected with SARS-CoV-2. The drugs can be restarted once the infectious process is resolved.","de León-Rendón, J L; Hurtado-Salazar, C; Yamamoto-Furusho, J K",Rev Gastroenterol Mex,,426

379681,H-WORK Project: Multilevel Interventions to Promote Mental Health in SMEs and Public Workplaces,2020,"The systemic risk induced by climate change represents one of the most prominent threats facing humanity and has attracted increasing attention since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic at the end of 2019. The existing literature highlights the importance of systemic risk induced by climate change, but there are still deficiencies in understanding its dynamics and assessing the risk. Aiming to bridge this gap, this study develops a theoretical framework and employs two cases to illustrate the concept, origin, occurrence, propagation, evolution, and assessment framework of systemic risk induced by climate change. The key findings include: 1) systemic risk induced by climate change derives from the rapid growth of greenhouse gas emissions, increasingly complex connections among different socioeconomic systems, and continuous changes in exposure and vulnerability;2) systemic risk induced by climate change is a holistic risk generated by the interconnection, interaction, and dynamic evolution of different types of single risks, and its fundamental, defining feature is cascading effects. The extent of risk propagation and its duration depend on the characteristics of the various discrete risks that are connected to make up the systemic risk;3) impact domains, severity of impact, and probability of occurrences are three core indicators in systemic risk assessment, and the impact domains should include the economy, society, homeland security, human health, and living conditions. We propose to deepen systemic risk research from three aspects: to develop theories to understand the mechanism of systemic risk;to conduct empirical research to assess future risks;and to develop countermeasures to mitigate the risk. © 2021 The Authors","Li, H.

381708,Tendency to Worry and Fear of Mental Health during Italy's COVID-19 Lockdown,2020,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: A dysregulated inflammatory profile plays an important role in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis. Moreover, the depletion of lymphocytes is typically associated with an unfavourable disease course. We studied the role and impact of p53 and deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) on lymph-monocyte homeostasis and their possible effect on T and B cell signalling. METHODS: Gene expression analysis and flow cytometry were performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 35 COVID-19 patients and 10 healthy donors (HD). Inflammatory cytokines, the frequency of Annexin+ cells among CD3+ T cells and CD19+ B cell subsets were quantified. RESULTS: PBMC from COVID-19 patients had a higher p53 expression, and higher concentrations of plasma proinflammatory cytokines (IL1ß, TNF-&#945;, IL8, and IL6) than HD. Deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression was significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients and was negatively correlated with p53 (p = 0.003 and r = -0.48). A lower expression of IL-7R and B Cell linker (BLNK), key genes for lymphocyte homeostasis and function, was observed in COVID-19 than in HD. The reduction of IgK and IgL chains was seen in lymphopenic COVID-19 patients. A significant increase in both apoptotic B and T cells were observed. Inflammatory cytokines correlated positively with p53 (IL-1ß: r = 0.5 and p = 0.05; IL-8: r = 0.5 and p = 0.05) and negatively with SIRT1 (IL1-ß: r = -0.5 and p = 0.04; TNF-&#945;: r = -0.4 and p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data indicate that the inflammatory environment, the dysregulated p53/SIRT1 axis and low expression of IL7R and BLNK may impact cell survival, B cell signalling and antibody production in COVID-19 patients. Further studies are required to define the functional impact of low BLNK/IL7R expression during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection.","Bordoni, Veronica; Tartaglia, Eleonora; Sacchi, Alessandra; Fimia, Gian Maria; Cimini, Eleonora; Casetti, Rita; Notari, Stefania; Grassi, Germana; Marchioni, Luisa; Bibas, Michele; Capobianchi, Maria R; Locatelli, Franco; Maeurer, Markus; Zumla, Alimuddin; Antinori, Andrea; Nicastri, Emanuele; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Agrati, Chiara",Int J Infect Dis,,426

This study utilized four statistical and deep learning techniques for forecasting: autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), feedforward neural network (FNN), multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, and long short-term memory (LSTM). With regard to 1-year records (ie, whole time series data), records from the last 14 days served as the validation set to evaluate the performance of the forecast, whereas earlier records served as the training set. RESULTS: A total of 171 countries that featured in both databases were included in the online system. The CPAIS was developed to explore variations, trends, and forecasts related to the COVID-19 pandemic across several counties. For instance, the number of confirmed monthly cases in the United States reached a local peak in July 2020 and another peak of 6,368,591 in December 2020. A dynamic heat map with policy measures depicts changes in COVID-19 measures for each country. A total of 19 measures were embedded within the three sections presented on the website, and only 4 of the 19 measures were continuous measures related to financial support or investment. Deep learning models were used to enable COVID-19 forecasting; the performances of ARIMA, FNN, and the MLP neural network were not stable because their forecast accuracy was only better than LSTM for a few countries. LSTM demonstrated the best forecast accuracy for Canada, as the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were 2272.551, 1501.248, and 0.2723075, respectively. ARIMA (RMSE=317.53169; MAPE=0.4641688) and FNN (RMSE=181.29894; MAPE=0.2708482) demonstrated better performance for South Korea. CONCLUSIONS: The CPAIS collects and summarizes information about the COVID-19 pandemic and offers data visualization and deep learning-based prediction. It might be a useful reference for predicting a serious outbreak or epidemic. Moreover, the system undergoes daily updates and includes the latest information on vaccination, which may change the dynamics of the pandemic.","Yu, Cheng-Sheng; Chang, Shy-Shin; Chang, Tzu-Hao; Wu, Jenny L; Lin, Yu-Jiun; Chien, Hsiung-Fei; Chen, Ray-Jade",J Med Internet Res,,426

385348,Beyond the Pandemic: COVID-19 Pandemic Changed the Face of Life,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic mainly involves respiratory symptoms, though gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are increasingly being recognized. In this context, the presence of comorbidities appears to be associated with adverse outcomes. However, the role of digestive manifestations is not yet well defined. The primary aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of GI symptoms and digestive comorbidities in a cohort of patients with COVID-19 compared to controls. The secondary aim was to determine the association of GI-symptoms and digestive comorbidities with clinical outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Inpatients with COVID-19 and controls with similar symptoms and/or radiological findings were enrolled. Symptoms at admission and throughout hospitalization were collected as they were comorbidities. The measured clinical outcomes were mortality, intensive care unit admission and cumulative endpoint. RESULTS: A total of 105 patients were included: 34 with COVID-19 and 71 controls. At admission, the prevalence of GI symptoms among COVID-19 patients was 8.8%. During hospitalization, the frequency of GI symptoms was higher in patients with COVID-19 than in controls (p=0.004). Among patients with COVID-19, the mortality and a cumulative endpoint rates of those with GI symptoms were both lower than for those without GI symptoms (p=0.016 and p=0.000, respectively). Finally, we found digestive comorbidities to be associated with a milder course of COVID-19 (p=0.039 for cumulative endpoint). CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlighted the non-negligible frequency of GI symptoms in patients with COVID-19, partly attributable to the therapies implemented. In addition, the presence of GI symptoms and digestive comorbidities is associated with better outcomes. Most likely, digestive comorbidities do not hinder the host's immune response against SARS-COV-2, and the occurrence of GI symptoms might be linked to a faster reduction of the viral load via the faecal route.","Papa, A; Covino, M; Pizzolante, F; Miele, L; Lopetuso, L R; Bove, V; Iorio, R; Simeoni, B; Vetrone, L M; Tricoli, L; Mignini, I; Schepis, T; D039,; Alessandro, A; Coppola, G; Nicoletti, T; Visconti, E; Rapaccini, G",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,426

However, a model-based evaluation of the spatial distribution of these events is lacking. PURPOSE: Our aim was to quantitatively evaluate whether a network diffusion model can explain the spread of small neurologic events. DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and LitCovid data bases were searched from January 1, 2020, to July 19, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Thirty-five case series and case studies reported 317 small neurologic events in 123 unique patients with COVID-19. DATA ANALYSIS: Neurologic events were localized to gray or white matter regions of the Illinois Institute of Technology (gray-matter and white matter) Human Brain Atlas using radiologic images and descriptions. The total proportion of events was calculated for each region. A network diffusion model was implemented, and any brain regions showing a significant association (P < .05, family-wise error-corrected) between predicted and measured events were considered epicenters. DATA SYNTHESIS: Within gray matter, neurologic events were widely distributed, with the largest number of events (â¼10%) observed in the bilateral superior temporal, precentral, and lateral occipital cortices, respectively. Network diffusion modeling showed a significant association between predicted and measured gray matter events when the spread of pathology was seeded from the bilateral cerebellum (r = 0.51, P < .001, corrected) and putamen (r = 0.4, P = .02, corrected). In white matter, most events (â¼26%) were observed within the bilateral corticospinal tracts. LIMITATIONS: The risk of bias was not considered because all studies were either case series or case studies. CONCLUSIONS: Transconnectome diffusion of pathology via the structural network of the brain may contribute to the spread of neurologic events in patients with COVID-19.","Parsons, N; Outsikas, A; Parish, A; Clohesy, R; D039,; Aprano, F; Toomey, F; Advani, S; Poudel, G R",AJNR am. j. neuroradiology,,426

392782,School Nurses' Experience of Working in School Health Service during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Sweden,2021,"During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, a lockdown was imposed in France during the first wave. An apparent decrease in incidence of cellulitis of odontogenic origin was noticed then. This study aimed to compare the incidence of cellulitis during this extraordinary period with the same period in 2018 and 2019, based on retrospective multicentric data. All maxillofacial surgery departments in French public hospitals were contacted. Responders were asked to include all patients admitted for the surgical drainage of a head and neck abscess of odontogenic origin during the first 2020 lockdown period, and in a similar time frame in 2018 and 2019 (control group), based on screening the French diagnostic and therapeutic classification of medical acts. We report a 44% significant nationwide decrease in the incidence of admissions for cellulitis. There were 187 patients in 2020 for 334 and 333 patients in 2018/2019 respectively. The reasons to explain this finding are hypothetical (organizational reasons leading to earlier management, patients' fear to seek for medical management, usual excess in surgical indications or concomitant decrease of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs delivery). Whatever the explanation, it would be of great interest to find it out in order to improve the prevention of cellulitis.","Kün-Darbois, J D; Kahn, A; Khonsari, R H; Gueutier, A; Baldini, N; Corre, P; Bertin, H; Provost, M; Lesclous, P; Ansidei, C M; Majoufre, C; Louvrier, A; Meyer, C; Ammari, H; Rougeot, A; Moret, A; Poisbleau, D; Nicot, R; Marti-Flich, L; Ferri, J; Lutz, J C; Prevost, R; Kimakhe, J; Poulet, V; Lauwers, F; Veyssière, A; Bénateau, H; Pham Dang, N; Barthelemy, I; Foletti, J M; Chossegros, C; Queiros, C; Laure, B; Paré, A; de Boutray, M",J.

According to the World Health Organization, the most effective way to thwart the transmission of coronavirus is to wear medical face masks. Monitoring the use of face masks in public places has been a challenge because manual monitoring could be unsafe. This paper proposes an architecture for detecting medical face masks for deployment on resource-constrained endpoints having extremely low memory footprints. A small development board with an ARM Cortex-M7 microcontroller clocked at 480 MHz and having just 496 KB of framebuffer RAM has been used for the deployment of the model.

395040,Occupational Safety of Municipal Police Officers: Assessing the Vulnerability and Riskiness of Police Officers' Work,2021,"Infertility affects approximately 15-20% of individuals of reproductive age worldwide. Over the last 40 years, assisted reproductive technology (ART) has helped millions of childless couples. However, ART is limited by a low success rate and risk of multiple gestations. Devising methods for selecting the best gamete or embryo that increases the ART success rate and prevention of multiple gestation has become one of the key goals in ART today. Special emphasis has been placed on the development of non-invasive approaches, which do not require perturbing the embryonic cells, as the current morphology-based embryo selection approach has shortcomings in predicting the implantation potential of embryos. An observed association between embryo metabolism and viability has prompted researchers to develop metabolomics-based biomarkers. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provides a non-invasive approach for the metabolic profiling of tissues, gametes and embryos, with the key advantage of having a minimal sample preparation procedure. Using NMR spectroscopy, biologically important molecules can be identified and quantified in intact cells, extracts or secretomes. This, in turn, helps to map out the active metabolic pathways in a system. The present review covers the contribution of NMR spectroscopy in assisted reproduction at various stages of the process.","Asampille, Gitanjali; Cheredath, Aswathi; Joseph, David; Adiga, Satish K; Atreya, Hanudatta S",Open Biol,,426

We evaluated multiple extraction and PCR assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. We included 65 positive samples which were run on the Panther Fusion using a laboratory developed test (LDT, E gene target). Where viral RNA was extracted by MagNA Pure (MP) 96 extraction platform or EpMotion 5075/Geneaid extraction kit, SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed on Light Cycler (LC) 480 using a LDT (E gene) or 3 commercial assays; Certest Viasure (Orf1ab, N genes) GenePro (E, RdRp genes) and A* Star Fortitude (proprietary target). Median Cts on LC 480 LDT for specimens (n = 9) extracted on MP 96 (26.6) were lower than on EpMotion (31.6) whereas median Cts for specimens (n = 10) extracted on the Panther Fusion LDT (23.1) were comparable with MP 96 /LC480 LDT (23.6). Specimens tested on Panther Fusion LDT (n = 28), extracted by MP 96, and amplified using commercial assays showed good concordance with a few exceptions; lower median Ct values were seen for 2 targets on GenePro (16.9, 21.5) and Viasure (19.5, 21.1) than for the Panther Fusion LDT (24.2) and A* Star Fortitude (25.6). Specimens tested on MP 96 (n = 18) had comparable results using commercial assays, with lower median Cts for Viasure (22.2, 23.7) compared with the LC 480 LDT (24.7), GenePro (24.7,25.7) and A*Fortitude (25.1) assays.

397273,Experience from a Multi-Disciplinary Team Against COVID-19: A Healthcare Perspective,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put an enormous strain on healthcare systems and intensive care unit (ICU) capacity, leading to suspension of most elective procedures, including transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, deferment of TAVR is associated with significant wait-time mortality in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis. Conversely, there is currently no data available regarding the safety and feasibility of a continued TAVR program during this unprecedented crisis. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of patients undergoing TAVR during the COVID-19 pandemic in our center, with specific emphasis on COVID-19 related outcomes. METHODS: All patients who underwent TAVR in our center between February 27, 2020, and June 30, 2020, were evaluated. Clinical outcomes were described in terms of Valve Academic Research Consortium 2 definitions. Patient follow-up was done by chart review and telephone survey. RESULTS: A total of 71 patients have undergone TAVR during the study period. Median age was 80 years, 63% were men, and 25% were inpatients. Procedural success was 99%. After TAVR, 30% involved admission to the ICU, and 94% were ultimately discharged to the cardiac care unit on the same day. Two patients (3%) had confirmed COVID-19 a few days after TAVR, and both died of COVID-19 pneumonia within 2 weeks after hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: A continued TAVR program during the COVID-19 pandemic is feasible despite limited hospital resources. However, COVID-19 related mortality after TAVR is of concern.","Rooijakkers, Maxim J P; Li, Wilson W L; Wollersheim, Laurens W L M; Geuzebroek, Guillaume S C; Gehlmann, Helmut; van Garsse, Leen A F M; van Wely, Marleen H; Verkroost, Michel W A; Morshuis, Wim J; Wertheim, Heiman; van Royen, Niels",J Card Surg,,426

Materials and Methods: Internet survey with Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and questions regarding mobility patterns, attitude, and propensity to adjust toward the implemented measures and current health condition was made among Polish and Italian residents (Cronbach's alpha 0.86 and 0.79, respectively). The sample size was 7,108 (6,169 completed questionnaires in Poland and 939 in Italy). Results: The Polish group had a higher stress level than the Italian group (mean PSS-10 total score 22,14 vs 17,01, respectively;p &lt; 0.01). There was a greater prevalence of chronic diseases among Polish respondents. Italian subjects expressed more concern about their health, as well as about their future employment. Italian subjects did not comply with suggested restrictions as much as Polish subjects and were less eager to restrain from their usual activities (social, physical, and religious), which were more often perceived as ""most needed matters"" in Italian than in Polish residents. Conclusion: Higher activity level was found to be correlated with lower perceived stress, but the causality is unclear. Difference in adherence to restrictions between Polish and Italian residents suggests that introducing similar lockdown policies worldwide may not be as beneficial as expected. However, due to the applied method of convenience sampling and uneven study groups, one should be careful with generalizing these results.","Grabowski, J.; Stepien, J.; Waszak, P.; Michalski, T.; Meloni, R.; Grabkowska, M.; Macul, A.; Rojek, J.; Lorettu, L.; Sagan, I.; Bidzan, L.",Frontiers in Psychology,,426

This technique makes it possible to measure the colloid concentration field during the drying of the drop at a high accuracy (about 0.5%) and with a high temporal and spatial resolution (about 1 frame per s and 5 µm per pixel). These features allow us to probe mass transport of the charged dispersion in this out-of-equilibrium situation. In particular, our experiments provide the evidence that mass transport within the drop can be described by a purely diffusive process for some range of parameters for which the buoyancy-driven convection is negligible. We are then able to extract from these experiments the collective diffusion coefficient of the dispersion D(&#966;) over a wide concentration range &#966; = 0.24-0.5, i.e. from the liquid dispersed state to the solid glass regime, with a high accuracy. The measured values of D(&#966;) &#8771; 5-12D0 are significantly larger than the simple estimate D0 given by the Stokes-Einstein relation, thus highlighting the important role played by the colloidal interactions in such dispersions.","Sobac, Benjamin; Dehaeck, Sam; Bouchaudy, Anne; Salmon, Jean-Baptiste",,,426

METHODS: For this observational cross-sectional study, a web-based survey was distributed via social media forums. We used the validated Hebrew version of the Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 followed by a questionnaire developed specifically for the present study, focusing on the time of the COVID-19 pandemic (Mask Sinonasal Outcome Test), and questions regarding general health issues. The participants' mask-wearing routine was also studied. RESULTS: Seventy percent of 351 participants had experienced a change in their breathing during the time of the pandemic. The median total Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 score was 13, and 10% of the participants reported a significantly impaired quality of life. According to multivariate analyses, the only subject-related variables significantly associated with the reduced sinonasal quality of life were female gender, younger age, a background of chronic rhinitis and sinusitis, and the mask-wearing average daily duration. The mask sinonasal outcome test convergent validity was confirmed. CONCLUSION: The majority of our survey's responders, predominantly female and younger participants, reported reduced sinonasal quality of life in the COVID-19 pandemic period. It can be attributed to mask-wearing, especially for a prolonged time, irrespective of the existing mask type. These findings should encourage medical companies to produce more ""airway-minded"" personal protection equipment.","Primov-Fever, Adi; Amir, Ofer; Roziner, Ilan; Maoz-Segal, Ramit; Alon, Eran Emanuel; Yakirevitch, Arkadi",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,426

This hypothesis is evaluated by (a) exploratory analysis of SARS-CoV/human transcriptomic interaction data and gene set enrichment analysis (b) a confirmatory, focused review of the literature based on the findings by (a). A STRING Viruses (available search for human - SARS-CoV (NCBI taxonomy Id: 9606 vs. NCBI taxonomy Id: 694009) genomic interactions reveals ten human proteins, interacting with SARS-CoV: SGTA, FGL2, SPECC1, STAT3, PHB, BCL2L1, PPP1CA, CAV1, JUN, XPO1. Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) with STRING on this network revealed their role as a putative protein - protein interaction network (PPI; Enrichment p-value = 0.0296) mediating, viral parasitism, interleukin as well as insulin signaling, diabetes and triglyceride catabolism. In the literature, SARS-CoV has been known to cause de novo diabetes by ACE2-dependent uptake on pancreatic isle cells, and furthermore dysregulate lipid autophagy in favor of the viral lifecycle. Conversely, currently there are only non-causative, observational evidence of worse outcomes for COVID-19 patients with comorbid diabetes or hyperglycemia. No study has reported on the lipid profiles of COVID-19 patients; however, lipid-targeting molecules have been proposed as agents against SARS-CoV-2. Future studies, reporting on lipid and glucose metabolism of COVID-19 patients could help elucidate the disease's seculae and aid drug design.","Vavougios, George D",Med Hypotheses,,426

406448,Impact of COVID-19 on the Anxiety Perceived by Healthcare Professionals: Differences between Primary Care and Hospital Care,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). An appealing antiviral drug target is the coronavirus 3C-like protease (3CLpro) that is responsible for the processing of the viral polyproteins and liberation of functional proteins essential for the maturation and infectivity of the virus. In this study, multiple thermal analytical techniques have been implemented to acquire the thermodynamic parameters of 3CLpro at different buffer conditions. 3CLpro exhibited relatively high thermodynamic stabilities over a wide pH range; however, the protease was found to be less stable in the presence of salts. Divalent metal cations reduced the thermodynamic stability of 3CLpro more than monovalent cations; however, altering the ionic strength of the buffer solution did not alter the stability of 3CLpro. Furthermore, the most stable thermal kinetic stability of 3CLpro was recorded at pH 7.5, with the highest enthalpy of activation calculated from the slope of Eyring plot. The biochemical and biophysical properties of 3CLpro explored here may improve the solubility and stability of 3CLpro for optimum conditions for the setup of an enzymatic assay for the screening of inhibitors to be used as lead candidates in the discovery of drugs and design of antiviral therapeutics against COVID-19.","Ferreira, Juliana C; Rabeh, Wael M",Sci Rep,,426

A Questionnaire Survey,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Rapid descent in bone mineral density (BMD) and ascent in bone turnover marker (BTM) occur within the short period following denosumab (Dmab) discontinuation. In addition, the incidence of vertebral fracture also rises within the short period. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of sequential therapy using zoledronic acid (ZOL) on any adverse events after Dmab discontinuation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a multicenter retrospective observational study, and the subjects were osteoporosis patients who visited our institutions between 2013 and 2018. We performed sequential therapy using ZOL for 30 patients who had difficulty continuing Dmab, due to physical or social reasons, and investigated the fracture incidence and BMD/BTM changes at 4 time points (at the start of Dmab, the start of ZOL, 6 months after ZOL and 12 months after ZOL). RESULTS: No new vertebral/nonvertebral fractures were observed at each time point after switching from Dmab to ZOL in any of the 30 patients. The BMD/BTM changes were evaluated in 18 of the 30 cases, since all data of lumbar/femoral neck BMDs and TRACP-5b at 4 time points was only available in 18 cases. BMDs significantly increased at each time point compared with that at the start of Dmab. Serum TRACP-5b significantly decreased at each time point compared with that at the start of Dmab. CONCLUSION: It was suggested that sequential therapy using ZOL could suppress the decrease of BMD, and increase of BTM, if the period of Dmab administration was less than 3 years.","Kondo, Hideomi; Okimoto, Nobukazu; Yoshioka, Toru; Akahoshi, Shojiro; Fuse, Yoshifumi; Ogawa, Takayuki; Okazaki, Yuichi; Katae, Yuji; Tsukamoto, Manabu; Yamanaka, Yoshiaki; Kawasaki, Makoto; Sakai, Akinori",J. bone miner. metab,,426

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data on admission from patients with known or newly-diagnosed diabetes and confirmed COVID-19. First, survivors were compared to non-survivors to study the predictive factors of in-hospital death in patients with diabetes. Secondly, diabetic patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were matched for age and sex with non-diabetic patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, to study the prognosis and predictive factors of in-hospital death related to diabetes. RESULTS: Seventy-three diabetic patients were included. Mean age was 69 (±14) years. Women accounted for 52%. Most patients had type 2 diabetes (89.0%), long-term complications of hyperglycemia (59.1%), and hypertension (80.8%). The case-fatality rate (CFR) was 15%. Non-survivors had more severe pneumonia based on imaging (p 0.029) and were less often treated with metformin (p 0.036). In patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, CFR was 15.6% in diabetic (n = 64) and 25.0% in non-diabetic patients (n = 128), the difference being non-significant (p 0.194). Predictive factors of in-hospital death were elevated white blood cells count (HR 9.4, CI 1.50-58.8, p 0.016) and severe pneumonia on imaging (HR 25.0, CI 1.34-466, p 0.031) in diabetic patients, and cognitive impairment (HR 5.80, CI 1.61-20.9, p 0.007) and cardiovascular disease (HR 5.63, CI 1.54-20.6, p 0.009) in non-diabetic patients. CONCLUSION: In this monocentric cohort from Belgium, diabetic in-patients with COVID-19 had mostly type 2 diabetes, prevalent hyperglycemia-related vascular complications and comorbidities including hypertension. In this cohort, the CFR was not statistically different between patients with and without diabetes.","Orioli, Laura; Servais, Thomas; Belkhir, Leïla; Laterre, Pierre-François; Thissen, Jean-Paul; Vandeleene, Bernard; Maiter, Dominique; Yombi, Jean C; Hermans, Michel P",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,426

A Case Study of Romania,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to present a summary of the clinicopathological characteristics of patients affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that can be used as a reference for further research and clinical decisions. DESIGN: Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they had cohort, case-control or case series designs and provided sufficient details on clinical symptoms, laboratory outcomes and asymptomatic patients. SETTING: PubMed, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Wanfang, China Science and Technology Journal Database and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were electronically searched to identify related studies published between 1 January 2020 and 16 March 2020. Three reviewers independently examined the literature, extracted relevant data and assessed the risk of publication bias before including the studies in the meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS: The confirmed cases of COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 55 unique retrospective studies involving 8697 patients with COVID-19 were identified. Meta-analysis showed that a higher proportion of infected patients were male (53.3%), and the two major symptoms observed were fever (78.4%) and cough (58.3%). Other common symptoms included fatigue (34%), myalgia (21.9%), expectoration (23.7%), anorexia (22.9%), chest tightness (22.9%) and dyspnoea (20.6%). Minor symptoms included nausea and vomiting (6.6%), diarrhoea (8.2%), headache (11.3%), pharyngalgia (11.6%), shivering (15.2%) and rhinorrhea (7.3%). About 5.4% of the patients were asymptomatic. Most patients showed normal leucocyte counts (64.7%) and elevated C reactive protein levels (65.9%). Lymphopaenia was observed in about 47.6% of the infected patients, along with abnormal levels of myocardial enzymes (49.4%) and liver function (26.4%). Other findings included leucopenia (23.5%), elevated D-dimer (20.4%), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (20.4%), leucocytosis (9.9%), elevated procalcitonin (16.7%) and abnormal renal function (10.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The most commonly experienced symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were fever and cough. Myalgia, anorexia, chest tightness and dyspnoea were found in some patients. A relatively small percentage of patients were asymptomatic and could act as carriers of the disease. Most patients showed normal leucocyte counts, elevated levels of C reactive protein and lymphopaenia, confirming the viral origin of the disease.","Zhu, Jieyun; Zhong, Zhimei; Ji, Pan; Li, Hongyuan; Li, Bocheng; Pang, Jielong; Zhang, Jianfeng; Zhao, Chunling",,,426

409660,Effect of Income Level and Perception of Susceptibility and Severity of COVID-19 on Stay-at-Home Preventive Behavior in a Group of Older Adults in Mexico City,2020,"COVID-19 patients can excrete viable SARS-CoV-2 virus via urine and faeces, which has raised concerns over the possibility of COVID-19 transmission via aerosolized contaminated water or via the faecal-oral route. These concerns are especially exacerbated in many low- and middle-income countries, where untreated sewage is frequently discharged to surface waters. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in river water (RW) and raw wastewater (WW) samples. However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 viability in these environmental matrices. Determining the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in water under different environmental conditions is of great importance for basic assumptions in quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA). In this study, the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed using plaque assays following spiking of RW and WW samples with infectious SARS-CoV-2 that was previously isolated from a COVID-19 patient. These assays were carried out on autoclaved RW and WW samples, filtered (0.22 µm) and unfiltered, at 4 °C and 24 °C. Linear and nonlinear regression models were adjusted to the data. The Weibull regression model achieved the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and was hence chosen to estimate T90 and T99 (time required for 1 log and 2 log reductions, respectively). SARS-CoV-2 remained viable longer in filtered compared with unfiltered samples. RW and WW showed T90 values of 1.9 and 1.2 day and T99 values of 6.4 and 4.0 days, respectively. When samples were filtered through 0.22 µm pore size membranes, T90 values increased to 3.3 and 1.5 days, and T99 increased to 8.5 and 4.5 days, for RW and WW samples, respectively. Remarkable increases in SARS-CoV-2 persistence were observed in assays at 4 °C, which showed T90 values of 7.7 and 5.5 days, and T99 values of 18.7 and 17.5 days for RW and WW, respectively. These results highlight the variability of SARS-CoV-2 persistence in water and wastewater matrices and can be highly relevant to efforts aimed at quantifying water-related risks, which could be valuable for understanding and controlling the pandemic.","de Oliveira, Leonardo Camilo; Torres-Franco, Andrés Felipe; Lopes, Bruna Coelho; Santos, Beatriz Senra Álvares da Silva; Costa, Erica Azevedo; Costa, Michelle S; Reis, Marcus Tulius P; Melo, Marília C; Polizzi, Rodrigo Bicalho; Teixeira, Mauro Martins; Mota, César Rossas",Water Res,,426

410821,COVID-19-Awareness and Practice of Dentists in Saudi Arabia,2021,"OBJECTIVES: During the current covid-19 pandemic, healthcare students had to stop their face-to-face attendance at medical colleges and universities. This condition has resulted in a change in how learning and assessment of psychiatric and interprofessional practice occur. The pandemic has also increased clinical mentors' need to follow their mentees' educational progress via virtual technology, including smartphone-based educational apps. The aim of the study is to propose a model in psychiatric and medical interprofessional practice e-assessment. METHODS: In this study, 228 undergraduate healthcare students underwent a training period in interprofessional practice across specialties being assessed by Ecological Momentary e-Assessment (EMeA), and consisting of ongoing or before/after Interprofessional Education (IPE) learning evaluations with the assistance of an IPE-app linked to online surveys. The Goodness of Fit Test Chi-square and t-test statistics analyzed the data. RESULTS: Surveys during, at entry and exit points in IPE captured increased percentages of learners, specifically, reporting high patient satisfaction with interprofessional teams (c2=22.54; p<.01), learners experiencing very good quality of care when delivered by interprofessional teams (c2=30.02; p<.01) assessed by distance technology, and learners selecting less frequently peers from the same clinical background when support was needed in patient care (c2=19.84; p<.01). CONCLUSIONS: Contextual assessment (in the real-time and real-world scenario) of IPE learning moments via EMeA shows its value and applicability during the current covid-19 pandemic when the assessment of learning cannot occur face-to-face between learners and teachers. All healthcare students, including those on psychiatric rotations, could log in their progress, self-reflective assessments, and responses to coordinated care in interprofessional teams, without needing direct contact with their clinical tutors, and while treating patients with mental and physical illnesses, also including covid-19 positive patients.","Lazzari, Carlo; McAleer, Sean; Nusair, Abdul; Rabottini, Marco",Riv Psichiatr,,426

We pose and solve several complementary problems. First, we consider the design of a social sensing system whose objective is the early detection of a novel epidemic outbreak. In particular, we propose an algorithm to select a subset of individuals to be tested in order to detect the onset of an epidemic outbreak as fast as possible. We pose this problem as a hitting time probability maximization problem and use submodularity optimization techniques to derive explicit quality guarantees for the proposed solution. Second, once an epidemic outbreak has been detected, we consider the problem of adaptively distributing viral tests over time in order to maximize the information gained about the current state of the epidemic. We formalize this problem in terms of information entropy and mutual information and propose an adaptive allocation strategy with quality guarantees. For these problems, we derive analytical solutions for any stochastic compartmental epidemic model with Markovian dynamics, as well as efficient Monte-Carlo-based algorithms for non-Markovian dynamics. Finally, we illustrate the performance of the proposed framework in numerical experiments involving a model of Covid-19 applied to a real human contact network.","Batlle, Pau; Bruna, Joan; Fernandez-Granda, Carlos; Preciado, Victor M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01998v1.pdf,426

We aimed to determine whether, despite this, a decline in acute stroke presentations, imaging and intervention occurred during the pandemic at a busy stroke centre. METHODS: The number of 'code stroke' activations, multimodal CTs and endovascular clot retrievals (ECRs) performed during the pandemic period (3/1/2020-5/10/2020) at a large comprehensive stroke centre was compared against the pre-pandemic period (3/1/2019-1/31/2019) using Z-statistics. Year-on-year comparison of the number of patients with large vessel occlusions (LVOs) and ECRs performed per month was also made. RESULTS: The number of 'code stroke' activations and patients undergoing multimodal CT per month decreased significantly (P < 0.0025) following lockdown on 29th March. The number of ECRs also decreased (P = 0.165). The nadir in the weekly number of CTs coincided with lockdown and the peak of new COVID-19 cases. The number of patients with LVOs and ECRs increased by 15% and 14%, respectively, in March but decreased by 55% and 48%, respectively, in April. CONCLUSIONS: The significant decrease in volume of 'code stroke' activations and acute stroke imaging following lockdown was accompanied by a concomitant decrease in patients with LVOs and ECRs. The decrease in imaging was therefore not driven purely by patients with mild strokes and stroke mimics, but also included those with severe strokes. Since Australia had a low prevalence of COVID-19, this observed decrease cannot be attributed to hospital congestion and is instead likely driven by patient fear.","Amukotuwa, Shalini A; Bammer, Roland; Maingard, Julian",J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol,,426

Here, we quantify the response of the yeast proteome to low temperature (LT), a condition where aberrant mis-paired RNA folding intermediates accumulate. We show that, at LT, yeast cells globally boost production of their ribosome assembly machinery. We find that the LT-induced assembly factor, Puf6, binds to the nascent catalytic RNA-rich subunit interface within the 60S pre-ribosome, at a site that eventually loads the nuclear export apparatus. Ensemble Förster resonance energy transfer studies show that Puf6 mimics the role of Mg2+ to usher a unique long-range tertiary contact to compact rRNA. At LT, puf6 mutants accumulate 60S pre-ribosomes in the nucleus, thus unveiling Puf6-mediated rRNA compaction as a critical temperature-regulated rescue mechanism that counters rRNA misfolding to prime export competence.","Gerhardy, Stefan; Oborská-Oplová, Michaela; Gillet, Ludovic; Börner, Richard; van Nues, Rob; Leitner, Alexander; Michel, Erich; Petkowski, Janusz J; Granneman, Sander; Sigel, Roland K O; Aebersold, Ruedi; Panse, Vikram Govind",Nat Commun,,426

424587,What Caused the Outbreak of COVID-19 in China: From the Perspective of Crisis Management,2020,"Mechanical ventilation is a known risk factor for delirium, a cognitive impairment characterized by frontal cortex and hippocampal dysfunction. Although interleukin-6 (IL-6) is upregulated in mechanical ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) and may contribute to delirium, it is not known whether inhibition of systemic IL-6 mitigates delirium-relevant neuropathology. To histologically define neuropathological effects of IL-6 inhibition in an experimental VILI model. VILI was simulated in anesthetized adult mice using a 35cc/kg tidal volume mechanical ventilation model. There were two controls groups: 1) spontaneously breathing, or 2) anesthetized and mechanically ventilated with 10cc/kg tidal volume to distinguish effects of anesthesia from VILI. Two hours prior to inducing VILI, mice were treated with either anti-IL-6 antibody, anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, or saline. Neuronal injury, stress, and inflammation were assessed using immunohistochemistry. Cleaved caspase-3 (CC3), a neuronal apoptosis marker, was significantly increased in the frontal (p<0.001) and hippocampal (p<0.0001) brain regions and accompanied by significant increases in c-Fos and heat shock protein-90 in the frontal cortices of VILI mice compared to controls (p<0.001). These findings were not related to cerebral hypoxia and there was no evidence of irreversible neuronal death. Frontal and hippocampal neuronal CC3 were significantly reduced with anti-IL-6 antibody (p<0.01 and p<0.0001, respectively), anti-IL-6 receptor antibody (p<0.05 and p<0.0001, respectively) compared to saline VILI mice. VILI induces potentially reversible neuronal injury and inflammation in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, which is mitigated with IL-6 inhibition. These data suggest a potentially novel neuroprotective role of systemic IL-6 inhibition that justifies further investigation.","Sparrow, Nicklaus A; Anwar, Faizan; Covarrubias, Ambart E; Rajput, Padmesh S; Rashid, Mohammad Harun; Nisson, Peyton L; Gezalian, Michael M; Toossi, Shahed; Ayodele, Maranatha O; Karumanchi, S Ananth; Ely, E Wesley; Lahiri, Shouri",Am. j. respir. cell mol. biol,,426

To date, approximately one million deaths and over 32 million cases have been reported. This ongoing pandemic urgently requires an accurate testing device that can be used in the field in a fast manner. Serological assays to detect antibodies have been proven to be a great complement to the standard method of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), particularly after the second week of infection. We have developed a specific and sensitive immunosensor for immunoglobulin detection produced against SARS-CoV-2. Unlike other lateral flow-based assays (LFAs) involving the utilization of multiple antibodies, we have reported a label-free paper-based electrochemical platform targeting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies without the specific requirement of an antibody. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will interrupt the redox conversion of the redox indicator, resulting in a decreased current response. This electrochemical sensor was proven effective in real clinical sera from patients with satisfactory results. In addition, the proposed format was also extended to antigen detection (the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2), which presents new possibilities for diagnosing COVID-19.","Yakoh, Abdulhadee; Pimpitak, Umaporn; Rengpipat, Sirirat; Hirankarn, Nattiya; Chailapakul, Orawon; Chaiyo, Sudkate",Biosens Bioelectron,,426

432444,Analysis of Imported Cases of COVID-19 in Taiwan: A Nationwide Study,2020,"Background: The novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) led healthcare providers, including mental health providers, across the U.S. to swiftly shift to telemedicine. Objectives: This shift gave our Department of Psychiatry a chance to better understand key challenges and opportunities vis-à-vis virtual mental healthcare. We aimed to obtain provider feedback on the use of telepsychiatry and to learn from the provider perspective about patient experiences with video visits. This information will be used to inform the telemedicine strategy at a systems level within our psychiatry department, our academic health system, as well as the field of telemedicine as a whole. Design and Sample: A 22-item online questionnaire comprising 16 quantitative and six qualitative items was distributed to providers currently using video visits to provide care. Results: A total of 89 mental health providers completed the questionnaire. Outcomes demonstrated that while providers perceive challenges associated with virtual care (e.g., fatigue, technology-related issues, and age-related concerns), they also recognize a number of benefits to themselves and their patients (e.g., convenience and increased access). Overall, provider satisfaction, comfort, and willingness to use telepsychiatry was high. Conclusions: The vast majority of providers adapted quickly to the use of virtual platforms; many endorse advantages that suggest virtual care will continue to be a modality they provide in the future, post-COVID-19. It will be important to continue to evaluate aspects of virtual care that may limit clinical assessments and to optimize use to improve access, convenience, and cost-efficiency of mental healthcare delivery.","Parikh, Sagar V; Taubman, Danielle S; Grambeau, Mary; Menke, Rena A; Blazek, Mary C; Sullivan, Jennifer; Severe, Jennifer; Patel, Paresh D; Dalack, Gregory W",Psychopharmacol Bull,,426

435014,Visitor Capacity Considering Social Distancing in Urban Parks with Agent-Based Modeling,2021,"BACKGROUND: While the COVID-19 pandemic will increase mortality due to the virus, it is also likely to increase mortality indirectly. In this study, we estimate the additional maternal and under-5 child deaths resulting from the potential disruption of health systems and decreased access to food. METHODS: We modelled three scenarios in which the coverage of essential maternal and child health interventions is reduced by 9·8-51·9% and the prevalence of wasting is increased by 10-50%. Although our scenarios are hypothetical, we sought to reflect real-world possibilities, given emerging reports of the supply-side and demand-side effects of the pandemic. We used the Lives Saved Tool to estimate the additional maternal and under-5 child deaths under each scenario, in 118 low-income and middle-income countries. We estimated additional deaths for a single month and extrapolated for 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. FINDINGS: Our least severe scenario (coverage reductions of 9·8-18·5% and wasting increase of 10%) over 6 months would result in 253â500 additional child deaths and 12â200 additional maternal deaths. Our most severe scenario (coverage reductions of 39·3-51·9% and wasting increase of 50%) over 6 months would result in 1â157â000 additional child deaths and 56â700 additional maternal deaths. These additional deaths would represent an increase of 9·8-44·7% in under-5 child deaths per month, and an 8·3-38·6% increase in maternal deaths per month, across the 118 countries. Across our three scenarios, the reduced coverage of four childbirth interventions (parenteral administration of uterotonics, antibiotics, and anticonvulsants, and clean birth environments) would account for approximately 60% of additional maternal deaths. The increase in wasting prevalence would account for 18-23% of additional child deaths and reduced coverage of antibiotics for pneumonia and neonatal sepsis and of oral rehydration solution for diarrhoea would together account for around 41% of additional child deaths. INTERPRETATION: Our estimates are based on tentative assumptions and represent a wide range of outcomes. Nonetheless, they show that, if routine health care is disrupted and access to food is decreased (as a result of unavoidable shocks, health system collapse, or intentional choices made in responding to the pandemic), the increase in child and maternal deaths will be devastating. We hope these numbers add context as policy makers establish guidelines and allocate resources in the days and months to come.

440273,Guidelines for Pregnancy Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Public Health Conundrum,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The UK Government imposed a COVID19 lockdown (LD) restricting all but essential activities from 24th March 2020. Subsequently, there has been a significant reduction in casualty attendances nationwide including for ophthalmic emergencies. We aim to study the presentation of rhegmatogenous retinal detachments (RRD) and significant vitreous haemorrhage caused by posterior vitreous detachment (PVD-VH) in three tertiary centres covering most of the North West of England in the 6 weeks before and during the lockdown. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter non-randomised consecutive case series study was designed to collect information on all cases of RRD and PVD-VH requiring surgery presenting to the vitreoretinal departments of Manchester Royal Eye Hospital, East Lancashire NHS Foundation Trust and the Lancashire NHS Foundation Trust from 11th February to 4th May 2020. RESULTS: A total of 137 eyes of 137 patients were identified between the three centres of which 132 eyes were operated for RRD. Of these, 86 (64.7%) were operated pre-LD compared with 46 eyes (34.8%) during LD. Forty-five out of 86 eyes (52.3%) were macula-off pre-LD compared with 31 out of 46 eyes (67.3%) during LD (p = 0.06). There was lower proportion of non-PVD related RRD during LD (11 pre-LD to 1 during LD, p = 0.05). PVR was present in four cases during LD compared to 2 before (p = 0.19). CONCLUSION: There was a clinically significant reduction in the overall incidence of RRD in our centres with an increase in the proportion of macula-off and proliferative vitreoretinopathy during the LD period compared to a similar period before.","Jasani, Kirti M; Ivanova, Tsveta; Sabatino, Francesco; Patton, Niall; Dhawahir-Scala, Felipe; Chew, Grace; Charles, Stephen; David, Philip; Davies, Andrew; Jalil, Assad",Eur J Ophthalmol,,426

Instead, RADx Tech leveraged methodologies developed by CIMIT and utilized by POCTRN as described further in this special issue. RADx Tech uses a multi-stage review with two review panels, a Viability Panel and a Steering Panel, that are supported by subject matter experts and a Deep Dive team. Members of the panels have extensive commercialization and business experience in addition to scientific and technical knowledge. The Viability Panel is responsible for assessing whether the proposal is a good fit with the RADx Tech Program and whether it should be recommended to move into a Deep Dive. Less detailed information is requested in the application than a typical SBIR application since the application is refined and details added during the Deep Dive. The Steering Panel reviews the results from the Deep Dive and decides whether to recommend further funding. Everyone on the Viability Panel and Steering Panel reviews every application, thereby providing consistency and context for the reviewers. Utilization of an “assess, improve, and then select” process with review panels comprised of highly experienced review panel members has resulted in improved timing, efficiency, and effectiveness of reviews and has the potential to be extensible beyond RADx Tech.","Tessier, Paul Dempsey Michael Collins John Schachter Steve",IEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology,,426

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively examined FDG uptake in the WR/NP region in 534 patients with lymphoma as assessed by PET-CT used for both diagnosis and follow-up. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients had FDG uptake in the WR/NP region by PET-CT performed after completion of a chemotherapy regimen. Biopsy was performed for 11 of these patients in whom the uptake was considered to be pathologic, and results indicated the presence of reactive follicular hyperplasia. It was considered to be physiologic in 38 patients. PET-CT was repeated after 1 year, and no significant difference was identified between the standardized maximum uptake values (SUVmax; P = .107). The initial diagnosis of 20 patients was made via biopsy performed in the WR/NP region. The SUVmax for the FDG uptake in these patients, asymmetry, SUVmax of the coexisting lymphadenopathies in the neck, and FDG uptake with a counterpart finding by CT were significantly higher than other groups (P = .047, .001, and .005). CONCLUSION: When deciding whether to resample after treatment completion, it should be taken into account that, in addition to the SUVmax of the lesion, asymmetry, and the SUVmax of the coexisting lymphadenopathy in the neck, a crucial criterion is whether the FDG uptake has a counterpart finding by CT.","Kurtoglu, Erdal; Göçer, Mesut",Clin. lymphoma myeloma leuk.

Concern surrounding contagion and the pandemic has been found to affect the number and type of medical emergencies to which Emergency Medical Services (EMS) have responded. AIM: To identify, categorize, and analyze Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's national EMS, pre-hospital activities including patients' refusal to hospital transport, during the COVID-19 pandemic crises. METHODS: A comparative before and after design study of MDA incidents during March/April 2019 and March/April 2020. Medical type, frequency, demographic, location, and transport refusal proportions and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: A decrease of 2.6% in the total volume of incidents was observed during March and April 2020 compared with the equivalent period in 2019. This contrasted with the retrospective trend of annually increase observed through 2016-2019. Medical categories showing increase in 2020 were infectious disease, cardiac arrest, psychiatric, and labor and deliveries, with out-of-hospital deliveries increasing by 14%. Decreases in 2020 were seen in neurology and trauma, with trauma incidents occurring at home showing an 8.6% increase. Patients' refusal to transport rose from 13.4% in 2019 to 19.9% in 2020. Cases of refusals followed by death within 8 days were more prevalent in 2020. CONCLUSION: EMS must be prepared for changes in patients' behavior due to COVID concerns. Targeting populations at risk for refraining or refusing hospital transport and implementing diverse models of EMS, especially during pandemic times, will allow EMS to assist patients safely, either by reducing truly unnecessary ED visits minimizing contagion or by increasing hospital transports for patients in urgent or emergent conditions.","Siman-Tov, Maya; Strugo, Refael; Podolsky, Timna; Blushtein, Oren",Am J Emerg Med,,426
444434,Development of a Digital Lifestyle Modification Intervention for Use after Transient Ischaemic Attack or Minor Stroke: A Person-Based Approach,2021,"Social media platforms have become an essential source of information for many users. The purpose of the current study is to explore Egyptian social media users’ perceptions and behavior in the context of COVID-19 misinformation. The study was conducted in two stages;the first included identifying and categorizing misinformation shared in the Arabic language on Egyptian social media pages, and the second stage involved distributing a questionnaire to capture the users’ perceptions and behavior. The study utilized a mixed-methods approach to achieve the research objectives. In all, 1304 questionnaires were retrieved.The findings of the study showed that there are four main types of misinformation shared on social media. The first type is false claims about the virus or treatment of the virus;the second is false information about the government;the third is false content in general or manipulated content, and the last type is conspiracy theories. The findings also revealed that gender and education affect how people deal with and accept misinformation. Additionally, it was found that the spread of COVID-19 misinformation has caused negative feelings among the participants.The study was conducted on a sample of Egyptian participants and Egyptian social media pages on Facebook, hence, the types of misinformation and the results may differ in other countries, depending on the social media platform and other factors that may play a role in the spread of misinformation.

445282,Women's Depressive Symptoms during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Pregnancy,2021,"This Review, in addressing the unacceptably high mortality of patients with liver disease admitted to acute hospitals, reinforces the need for integrated clinical services. The masterplan described is based on regional, geographically sited liver centres, each linked to four to six surrounding district general hospitals-a pattern of care similar to that successfully introduced for stroke services. The plan includes the establishment of a lead and deputy lead clinician in each acute hospital, preferably a hepatologist or gastroenterologist with a special interest in liver disease, who will have prime responsibility for organising the care of admitted patients with liver disease on a 24/7 basis. Essential for the plan is greater access to intensive care units and high-dependency units, in line with the reconfiguration of emergency care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This Review strongly recommends full implementation of alcohol care teams in hospitals and improved working links with acute medical services. We also endorse recommendations from paediatric liver services to improve overall survival figures by diagnosing biliary atresia earlier based on stool colour charts and better caring for patients with impaired cognitive ability and developmental mental health problems. Pilot studies of earlier diagnosis have shown encouraging progress, with 5-6% of previously undiagnosed cases of severe fibrosis or cirrhosis identified through use of a portable FibroScan in primary care. Similar approaches to the detection of early asymptomatic disease are described in accounts from the devolved nations, and the potential of digital technology in improving the value of clinical consultation and screening programmes in primary care is highlighted. The striking contribution of comorbidities, particularly obesity and diabetes (with excess alcohol consumption known to be a major factor in obesity), to mortality in COVID-19 reinforces the need for fiscal and other long delayed regulatory measures to reduce the prevalence of obesity. These measures include the food sugar levy and the introduction of the minimum unit price policy to reduce alcohol consumption. Improving public health, this Review emphasises, will not only mitigate the severity of further waves of COVID-19, but is crucial to reducing the unacceptable burden from liver disease in the UK.","Williams, Roger; Alessi, Charles; Alexander, Graeme; Allison, Michael; Aspinall, Richard; Batterham, Rachel L; Bhala, Neeraj; Day, Natalie; Dhawan, Anil; Drummond, Colin; Ferguson, James; Foster, Graham; Gilmore, Ian; Goldacre, Raphael; Gordon, Harriet; Henn, Clive; Kelly, Deirdre; MacGilchrist, Alastair; McCorry, Roger; McDougall, Neil; Mirza, Zulfiquar; Moriarty, Kieran; Newsome, Philip; Pinder, Richard; Roberts, Stephen; Rutter, Harry; Ryder, Stephen; Samyn, Marianne; Severi, Katherine; Sheron, Nick; Thorburn, Douglas; Verne, Julia; Williams, John; Yeoman, Andrew",Lancet,,426

The medium to long-time follow up is a period of increased susceptibility for poorer weight outcomes which might be triggered by the lockdown. Twenty-four participants responded to an online questionnaire and a telephone interview. About half (n = 14; 58.3%) reported perceived weight gain during the lockdown, 13 (54.1%) limited access to social support, and 12 (50%) limited access to medical care. Co-habiting with a higher number of persons during lockdown was associated with fewer difficulties in dealing with emotionally activating situations, less fear of gaining weight, less fear of losing control over eating, and less disordered eating.

450096,Social Policy Responses to the Covid-19 Crisis in China in 2020,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused considerable disruption across the world, resulting in more than 235,000 deaths since December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 has a wide tropism and detection of the virus has been described in multiple specimen types, including various respiratory secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, and stool. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy and sensitivity of a laboratory modified CDCbased SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 assay across a range of sample types. Study Design We compared the matrix effect on the analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection by qRT-PCR in nasal swabs collected in viral transport medium (VTM), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), sputum, plasma, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), stool, VTM, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). Initial limits of detection (LoD) were subsequently narrowed to confirm an LoD for each specimen type and target gene. RESULTS: LoDs were established using a modified CDC-based laboratory developed test and ranged from a mean CT cut-off of 33.8-35.7 (10-20 copies/reaction) for the N1 gene target, and 34.0-36.2 (1-10 copies/reaction) for N2. Alternatives to VTM such as PBS and HBSS had comparable LoDs. The N2 gene target was found to be most sensitive in CSF. CONCLUSION: A modified CDC-based laboratory developed test is able to detect SARSCoV- 2 accurately with similar sensitivity across all sample types tested.","Perchetti, Garrett A; Nalla, Arun K; Huang, Meei-Li; Zhu, Haiying; Wei, Yulun; Stensland, Larry; Loprieno, Michelle A; Jerome, Keith R; Greninger, Alexander L",J Clin Virol,,426
450881,Risk Assessment of the SME Sector Operations during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Especially among older adults, the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic poses a challenge to day-to-day functioning and emotional and physical health. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze gender differences in state anxiety, daily functional self-actualization, and functional cognition and relationships among those factors in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. METHODS: We collected online data from a sample of 204 people (102 men and 102 women) aged 60 years and older. In addition to a demographic questionnaire, we used the State-Trait Personality Inventory to assess state anxiety, Daily Functional Actualization questionnaire to evaluate daily functional self-actualization, and Daily Living Questionnaire (DLQ) to measure functional cognition. RESULTS: Significant gender differences were found for state anxiety, t202=-2.36, P=.02; daily functional self-actualization, t202=2.15, P=.03; and the functional cognition components: complex tasks, Z=-3.07, P=.002; cognitive symptoms that might be interfering, Z=-2.15, P=.028; executive functions, Z=-2.21, P=.024; and executive function monitoring, Z=-2.21, P=.027. Significant medium correlations were found between both state anxiety level and daily functional self-actualization (r=-.62, P<.001) and functional cognition (r=.37-.40, P<.001). Gender predicted 3%, while daily functional self-actualization predicted 41%, and complex activities (DLQ) an additional 3% of the variance in state anxiety level, F3,202=9.57, P=.01. CONCLUSIONS: In older adults, anxiety is associated with cognitive decline, which may harm daily functional abilities and lead to social isolation, loneliness, and decreased well-being. Self-awareness and knowledge of gender differences and relationships between common available resources of daily functional self-actualization and functional cognition with anxiety may be strengthening factors in crisis periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rosenblum, Sara; Cohen Elimelech, Ortal",,,426

Internet serves as a budget friendly and faster communication channel between SERVICE SEEKER and SERVICE PROVIDER for delivery of SERVICE REQUEST and SERVICE RESPONSE respectively. As a result, it helps to bring down the operational cost of service delivery system within the affordability of populace. However, this easy accessibility of Internet also makes it susceptible to infringement attempts of adversaries, which widens exponentially with multiparty engagements during any electronic transaction. If these security lapses can be identified and sanitized properly, electronic communication medium can serve as an efficient service delivery system for multivariate sectors like public healthcare, medical research, finance, public transport, agro-based sectors, etc. This concept of Citizen centric electronic service delivery system becomes highly relevant in global pandemic situation like Corona virus (COVID-19), where people are compelled to maintain social distancing (by staying at home) to break the chain of virus transmission within the society. Furthermore, to integrate all these Citizen centric electronic services, a single window based Integrated Electronic Service Delivery System (IESDS) may be proposed to proceed towards unbiased and corruption free healthy society.

However, the pathophysiology of the disease is largely unknown. Shotgun metagenomics from nasopharyngeal swabs were used to characterize the genomic, metagenomic and transcriptomic features of patients from the first pandemic wave with various forms of COVID-19, including outpatients, patients hospitalized not requiring intensive care, and patients in the intensive care unit, to identify viral and/or host factors associated with the most severe forms of the disease. Neither the genetic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, nor the detection of bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites were associated with the severity of pulmonary disease. Severe pneumonia was associated with overexpression of cytokine transcripts activating the CXCR2 pathway, whereas patients with benign disease presented with a T helper ""Th1-Th17"" profile. The latter profile was associated with female gender and a lower mortality rate. Our findings indicate that the most severe cases of COVID-19 are characterized by the presence of overactive immune cells resulting in neutrophil pulmonary infiltration which, in turn, could enhance the inflammatory response and prolong tissue damage. These findings make CXCR2 antagonists, in particular IL-8 antagonists, promising candidates for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19.","Rodriguez, Christophe; de Prost, Nicolas; Fourati, Slim; Lamoureux, Claudie; Gricourt, Guillaume; N039,; debi, Melissa; Canoui-Poitrine, Florence; Désveaux, Isaac; Picard, Oriane; Demontant, Vanessa; Trawinski, Elisabeth; Lepeule, Raphaël; Surgers, Laure; Vindrios, William; Lelièvre, Jean-Daniel; Mongardon, Nicolas; Langeron, Olivier; Cohen, José L; Mekontso-Dessap, Armand; Woerther, Paul-Louis; Pawlotsky, Jean-Michel",PLoS Pathog,,426

461052,The Significance of Demographic Variables on Psychosocial Health from the Early Stage and Nine Months after the COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak. A Cross-National Study,2021,"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is an important feline viral disease, causing an overridden inflammatory response that results in a high mortality rate, primarily in young cats. Curcumin is notable for its biological activities against various viral diseases; however, its poor bioavailability has hindered its potential in therapeutic application. In this study, curcumin was encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles to improve its bioavailability. Curcumin-encapsulated chitosan (Cur-CS) nanoparticles were synthesised based on the ionic gelation technique and were spherical and cuboidal in shape, with an average particle size of 330 nm and +42 mV in zeta potential. The nanoparticles exerted lower toxicity in Crandell-Rees feline kidney (CrFK) cells and enhanced antiviral activities with a selective index (SI) value three times higher than that of curcumin. Feline-specific bead-based multiplex immunoassay and qPCR were used to examine their modulatory effects on proinflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor (TNF)&#945;, interleukin- (IL-) 6, and IL-1ß. There were significant decrements in IL-1ß, IL-6, and TNF&#945; expression in both curcumin and Cur-CS nanoparticles. Based on the multiplex immunoassay, curcumin and the Cur-CS nanoparticles could lower the immune-related proteins in FIP virus (FIPV) infection. The single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics profiles of curcumin and the Cur-CS nanoparticles were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Oral delivery of the Cur-CS nanoparticles to cats showed enhanced bioavailability with a maximum plasma concentration (C max) value of 621.5 ng/mL. Incorporating chitosan nanoparticles to deliver curcumin improved the oral bioavailability and antiviral effects of curcumin against FIPV infection. This study provides evidence for the potential of Cur-CS nanoparticles as a supplementary treatment of FIP.","Ng, Shing Wei; Selvarajah, Gayathri Thevi; Hussein, Mohd Zobir; Yeap, Swee Keong; Omar, Abdul Rahman",Biomed Res Int,,426

461983,Impact of the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic on HIV/AIDS Programming in Kenya: Evidence from Kibera Informal Settlement and COVID-19 Hotspot Counties,2021,"BACKGROUND: Different countries have adopted different containment and testing strategies for SARS-CoV-2. The difference in testing makes it difficult to compare the effect of different containment strategies. This study proposes methods to allow a direct comparison and presents the results. DESIGN: Publicly available data on the numbers of reported COVID-19-related deaths between 01 January and 17 April 2020 were compared between countries. RESULTS: The numbers of cases or deaths per 100,000 inhabitants gave severely biased comparisons between countries. Only the number of deaths expressed as a percentage of the number of deaths on day 25 after the first reported COVID-19-related death allowed a direct comparison between countries. From this comparison clear differences were observed between countries, associated with the timing of the implementation of containment measures. CONCLUSIONS: Comparisons between countries are only possible when simultaneously taking into account that the virus does not arrive in all countries simultaneously, absolute numbers are incomparable due to different population sizes, rates per 100,000 of the population are incomparable because not all countries are affected homogeneously, susceptibility to death by COVID-19 can differ between populations, and a death is only reported as a COVID-19-related death if the patient was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. With the current methods, all these factors were accounted for and an unbiased direct comparison between countries was established. This comparison confirmed that early adoption of containment strategies is key in flattening the curve of the epidemic.","Middelburg, Rutger A; Rosendaal, Frits R",Int J Infect Dis,,426

The number of articles in the media varied much with Los Angeles Times leading with 32 articles discovered in the search. About 76% of all articles in the media were negative to China and 24% were sympathetic and only one article (American Conservative) saw the benefit of economic contribution of China to the USA. Both maximum negative and positive articles were seen in Los Angeles Times. All of the articles in the Star Tribune were negative and close to 95% in US today, also. However, the total numbers of articles in these two were only 15 and 19 respectively. Majority of articles in both right-centered and left-centered media were negative with obvious sympathetic stand of left-centered media towards China. On this basis, no definite association between political bias and positive or negative reporting on the role of China in COVID-19 spread in the USA exists for the eight US media studied.

In France, a few people have downloaded and are using the StopCovid contact tracing app. Among them, students in the health domain are especially concerned. Exploring their usage and opinions about the app can inform improvements and diffusion of StopCovid among young people. OBJECTIVE: To investigate health-related students' knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and practices about the StopCovid app. METHODS: A field survey was conducted among 318 students at the health sciences campus of the University of Bordeaux, France, between September 25th and October 16th, 2020. Quota sampling method was used and descriptive statistics and univariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 77.3% (246/318) students had heard about the app, but only 11.3% (36/318) had downloaded it and 4.7% (15/318) were still using it at the time of the survey. Main reasons for not using the app were: belief that it was not effective given its limited diffusion (17.6%, 37/210), lack of interest (17.6%, 37/210) and distrust in data security and fear to be geo-located (15.7%, 33/210). Among those who had not heard about the app, after a brief description of its functioning and confidentiality policy, 52.7% (38/72) would use it. Participants reported that the main solution for increasing the use of the app would be a better communication (71.4%, 227/318). CONCLUSIONS: Even among health students the contact tracing app was poorly used. Findings suggest that improved communication describing its advantages and simplicity of use as well as clarifying false beliefs about it could help improving significantly its uptake.","Montagni, Ilaria; Roussel, Nicolas; Thiébaut, Rodolphe; Tzourio, Christophe",J. med. internet res,,426
465084,The COVID-19 Outbreak and Affected Countries Stock Markets Response,2020,"This work is motivated by the recent worldwide pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). When an epidemiological disease is prevalent, estimating the case fatality rate, the proportion of deaths out of the total cases, accurately and quickly is important as the case fatality rate is one of the crucial indicators of the risk of a disease. In this work, we propose an alternative estimator of the case fatality rate that provides more accurate estimate during an outbreak by reducing the downward bias (underestimation) of the naive CFR, the proportion of deaths out of confirmed cases at each time point, which is the most commonly used estimator due to the simplicity. The proposed estimator is designed to achieve the availability of real-time update by using the commonly reported quantities, the numbers of confirmed, cured, deceased cases, in the computation. To enhance the accuracy, the proposed estimator adapts a stratification, which allows the estimator to use information from heterogeneous strata separately. By the COVID-19 cases of China, South Korea and the United States, we numerically show the proposed stratification-based estimator plays a role of providing an early warning about the severity of a epidemiological disease that estimates the final case fatality rate accurately and shows faster convergence to the final case fatality rate.","Kim, ByungWon Kim SeongHong Jang WonCheol Jung SungKyu Lim JoHan",PLoS ONE,,426

A national online survey was administered between May and June 2020 that targeted a representative U.S. sample and yielded data from 1276 respondents, including 58% male and 50% racial/ethnic minorities. We used univariate and multivariable linear regression models to examine the associations of sociodemographic, mental health, and behavioral determinants with self-reported changes in lifestyle behaviors. Some study participants reported increases in healthy lifestyle behaviors since the pandemic (i.e., 36% increased healthy eating behaviors, and 33% increased physical activity). However, they also reported increases in addictive lifestyle behaviors including alcohol use (40%), tobacco use (41%), and vaping (46%). With regard to individual-level determinants, individuals who reported adhering to social distancing guidelines were also more likely to report increases in healthy lifestyle behaviors (ß = 0.12, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.21). Conversely, women (ß = -0.37, 95% CI -0.62 to -0.12), and unemployed individuals (ß = -0.33, 95% CI -0.64 to -0.02) were less likely to report increases in healthy lifestyle behaviors. In addition, individuals reporting anxiety were more likely to report increases in addictive behaviors (ß = 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.43). Taken together, these findings suggest that women and unemployed individuals may benefit from interventions targeting diet and physical activity, and that individuals reporting anxiety may benefit from interventions targeting smoking and alcohol cessation to address lifestyle changes during the pandemic.","Zhang, Xiaotao; Oluyomi, Abiodun; Woodard, LeChauncy; Raza, Syed Ahsan; Adel Fahmideh, Maral; El-Mubasher, Ola; Byun, Jinyoung; Han, Younghun; Amos, Christopher I; Badr, Hoda",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,426

Pakistan's economy is suffered mainly by the novel coronavirus. The massive healthcare expenditures bring inadequacy to manage COVID-19. The study explored the effects of coronavirus fear among the students who remain in their homes due to educational institutions' closure. The study results show that female students mostly fear the coronavirus pandemic compared to their male counterparts that negatively impact their health. The ""age"" of the students and ""household size"" positively impact students' health, while the student's existing ""healthcare profile"" is not competitive enough to escape from the deadly coronavirus. The ""knowledge"" for the coronavirus pandemic and its prevention guidelines is the only solution to contain coronavirus. Simultaneously, ""ignorance"" is the foremost factor that could be more dangerous to spread coronavirus among the students; besides the COVID-19 pandemic, students and general public health mainly suffered from environmental pollution. The current epidemic also exacerbated environmental concerns among students isolated in their homes, and their outdoor activities are primarily limited. Hence, the student's quality of life is exposed mainly to environmental pollution over time. The ""healthcare expenditures"" and ""government support"" both are not competitive enough to control novel coronavirus. Thus, it required more sustainable strategic policies and national unity to controlled coronavirus with firm conviction and provincial synchronization.","Anser, Muhammad Khalid; Sharif, Muhammad; Khan, Muhammad Azhar; Nassani, Abdelmohsen A; Zaman, Khalid; Abro, Muhammad Moinuddin Qazi; Kabbani, Ahmad",,,426

One negative consequence of the ongoing pandemic is anxiety brought about by uncertainty and the COVID-19 disease. Increased anxiety is a potential risk factor for wellbeing at work. This study investigated psychological, situational, and socio-demographic predictors of COVID-19 anxiety using longitudinal data. Methods: A nationally representative sample of Finnish workers (N = 1308) was collected before and during the COVID-19 crisis. Eighty percent of the participants responded to the follow-up study (N = 1044). COVID-19 anxiety was measured with a modified Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Psychological and situational predictors included perceived loneliness, psychological distress, technostress, personality, social support received from the work community, and remote working. A number of socio-demographic factors were also investigated. Results: Perceived loneliness, psychological distress, technostress, and neuroticism were identified as robust psychological predictors of COVID-19 anxiety. Increase in psychological distress and technostress during the COVID-19 crisis predicted higher COVID-19 anxiety. A recent change in their field of work and decreased social support from work communities predicted COVID-19 anxiety. Women and young people experienced higher anxiety. Conclusions: Different factors explain workers' COVID-19 anxiety. Increased anxiety can disrupt wellbeing at work, emphasizing the organizations' role in maintaining an inclusive and caring work culture and providing technical and psychological support to workers during crisis.","Savolainen, Iina; Oksa, Reetta; Savela, Nina; Celuch, Magdalena; Oksanen, Atte",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,426

481575,"Community-Level Factors Associated with COVID-19 Cases and Testing Equity in King County, Washington",2020,"The ocular surface has been suggested as a site of infection with Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). This review examines the evidence for this hypothesis, and its implications for clinical practice. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, is transmitted by person-to-person contact, via airborne droplets, or through contact with contaminated surfaces. SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) to facilitate infection in humans. This review sets out to evaluate evidence for the ocular surface as a route of infection. A literature search in this area was conducted on 15 April 2020 using the Scopus database. In total, 287 results were returned and reviewed. There is preliminary evidence for ACE2 expression on corneal and conjunctival cells, but most of the other receptors to which coronaviruses bind appear to be found under epithelia of the ocular surface. Evidence from animal studies is limited, with a single study suggesting viral particles on the eye can travel to the lung, resulting in very mild infection. Coronavirus infection is rarely associated with conjunctivitis, with occasional cases reported in patients with confirmed COVID-19, along with isolated cases of conjunctivitis as a presenting sign. Coronaviruses have been rarely isolated from tears or conjunctival swabs. The evidence suggests coronaviruses are unlikely to bind to ocular surface cells to initiate infection. Additionally, hypotheses that the virus could travel from the nasopharynx or through the conjunctival capillaries to the ocular surface during infection are probably incorrect. Conjunctivitis and isolation of the virus from the ocular surface occur only rarely, and overwhelmingly in patients with confirmed COVID-19. Necessary precautions to prevent person-to-person transmission should be employed in clinical practice throughout the pandemic, and patients should be reminded to maintain good hygiene practices.","Willcox, Mark Dp; Walsh, Karen; Nichols, Jason J; Morgan, Philip B; Jones, Lyndon W",Clin Exp Optom,,426

However, the effect of COVID-19 on mental health in late-middle-aged adults remains unclear. Methods: This cross-sectional, web-based survey recruited 3,730 participants (&#8805; 50 years old) between February 28 and March 11 of 2020. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Insomnia Severity Index, and Acute Stress Disorder Scale were used to evaluate depression, anxiety, insomnia, and acute stress symptoms. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was fitted to explore risk factors that were associated with the selected outcomes. Results: The mean age of the participants was 54.44 ± 5.99 years, and 2,026 (54.3%) of the participants were female. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and acute stress symptoms among late-middle-aged adults in China during the COVID-19 pandemic was 20.4, 27.1, 27.5, and 21.2%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that participants who were quarantined had increased odds ratios for the four mental health symptoms, and those with a good understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic displayed a decreased risk for all mental health symptoms among late-middle-aged adults. In addition, participants with a low income and with a risk of COVID-19 exposure at work had a remarkably high risk of depression, anxiety, and acute stress symptoms. Conclusions: Mental health symptoms in late-middle-aged adults in China during the COVID-19 pandemic are prevalent. Population-specific mental health interventions should be developed to improve mental health outcomes in late-middle-aged adults during this public health emergency.","Zheng, Yong-Bo; Shi, Le; Lu, Zheng-An; Que, Jian-Yu; Yuan, Kai; Huang, Xiao-Lin; Liu, Lin; Wang, Yun-He; Lu, Qing-Dong; Wang, Zhong; Yan, Wei; Han, Ying; Sun, Xin-Yu; Bao, Yan-Ping; Shi, Jie; Lu, Lin",Front Public Health,,426

This study investigated (1) patterns of volunteering among older adults in Hong Kong during COVID-19; (2) associations between volunteering and mental health of older adults during COVID-19; and (3) associations between key psychological resources (e.g., self-efficacy and self-esteem) and volunteering among older adults during COVID-19. This study applied a cross-sectional design with data collected from 128 older adults in June 2020, who were trained as volunteers in a volunteer program that began before COVID-19. The study found that older adults continued to actively contribute to their communities by engaging in volunteering during COVID-19. The specific type of volunteering activities was linked to few depressive and anxiety symptoms. Older adults with increased self-esteem prior to COVID-19 were more likely to participate in volunteering activities related to COVID-19. Our study suggested that encouraging older adults to volunteer during the pandemic is a key pathway to maintain mental health. Social workers are encouraged to engage older adults in volunteerism regularly to offset the risk of depression and anxiety symptoms in times of crisis.","Chan, Wai; Chui, Cheryl Hiu Kwan; Cheung, Johnson Chun Sing; Lum, Terry Yat Sang; Lu, Shiyu",J Gerontol Soc Work,,426

METHODS: Patients suspected of COVID-19 with a negative first RT-PCR testing were retrospectively revalued after undergoing CT. CT was reviewed by two radiologists and classified as suspected COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 pneumonia or negative. The performance of both first RT-PCR result and CT was evaluated by using sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and area under the curve (AUC) and by using the second RT-PCR test as the reference standard. CT findings for confirmed COVID-19 positive or negative were compared by using the Pearson chi-squared test (P values < 0.05) RESULTS: Totally, 337 patients suspected of COVID-19 underwent CT and nasopharyngeal swabs in March 2020. Eighty-seven out of 337 patients had a negative first RT-PCR result; of these, 68 repeated RT-PCR testing and were included in the study. The first RT-PCR test showed SE 0, SP = 100%, PPV = NaN, NPV = 70%, AUC = 50%, and CT showed SE = 70% SP = 79%, PPV = 86%, NPV = 76%, AUC = 75%. The most relevant CT variables were ground glass opacity more than 50% and peripheral and/or perihilar distribution. DISCUSSION: Negative RT-PCR test but positive CT features should be highly suggestive of COVID-19 in a cluster or community transmission scenarios, and the second RT-PCR test should be promptly requested to confirm the final diagnosis.","Giannitto, Caterina; Sposta, Federica Mrakic; Repici, Alessandro; Vatteroni, Giulia; Casiraghi, Elena; Casari, Erminia; Ferraroli, Giorgio Maria; Fugazza, Alessandro; Sandri, Maria Teresa; Chiti, Arturo; Luca, Balzarini",Radiol Med,,426

We formulate this as a non-convex regularisation problem involving a sparsity-enforcing, Cauchy-based penalty function, and the inverse Radon transform. We employ a simple local maxima detection technique in the Radon transform domain, associated with known clinical definitions of line artefacts. Despite being non-convex, the proposed method has guaranteed convergence via a proximal splitting algorithm and accurately identifies both horizontal and vertical line artefacts in LUS images. In order to reduce the number of false and missed detection, our method includes a two-stage validation mechanism, which is performed in both Radon and image domains. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method in comparison to the current state-of-the-art B-line identification method and show a considerable performance gain with 87% correctly detected B-lines in LUS images of nine COVID-19 patients. In addition, owing to its fast convergence, which takes around 12 seconds for a given frame, our proposed method is readily applicable for processing LUS image sequences.","Karakucs, Oktay; Anantrasirichai, Nantheera; Aguersif, Amazigh; Silva, Stein; Basarab, Adrian; Achim, Alin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03080v1.pdf,426

The lung failure for sepsis is reported in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We previously reported that anisodamine hydrobromide (Ani HBr), an extract from the Chinese herb Anisodus tanguticus (Maxim) Pascher, could alleviate acute kidney injury in septic rats. In this study, we test whether Ani HBr protects against lung injury in septic rats. Adult specific pathogen-free (SPF) male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were intraperitoneally injected with 5 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 4 h or underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery for 24 h, followed by another 24 h treatment of Ani HBr (0, 1.8 and 5.4 mg/kg) or atropine (5 mg/kg) via tail intravenous injection. Lung injury was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, serum levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactic acid (LA), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), CXCL8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), serum and lung tissue levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malonaldehyde (MDA), immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of GSDMD and NLRP3, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. The protective mechanisms of Ani HBr against apoptosis and pyroptosis in lung tissues were examined by detecting the IL-1?, (pro) caspase-1, GSDMD and NLRP3 for pyroptosis, and (pro)caspase-3, Bcl-2 and Bax for apoptosis by Western Blot, respectively. Results showed that Ani HBr alleviated histopathologic injuries of the lung including inflammatory cell infiltration, and alveolar damages and edema in LPS- and CLP-induced septic rats. Ani HBr suppressed LPS- and CLP-induced CK, LA, LDH, CXCL8 and TNF-α in serum. Ani HBr reduced MDA in serum and lung tissue in septic rats, while elevated SOD activity. Ani HBr inhibited the positive cell rate of GSDMD and NLRP3 in lung sections induced by LPS and CLP, and inhibited the GSDMD and NLRP3 expression induced by LPS and CLP. Ani HBr inhibited LPS- and CLP-induced apoptosis in lung tissues. In accordance with the IHC staining results, Ani HBr inhibited expressions of IL-1?, NLRP 3, caspase-1 and GSDMD. The proapoptotic markers including Bax and (pro) caspase 3 were reduced by Ani HBr, and antiapoptotic marker Bcl-2 was increased by Ani HBr. The protective effects of Ani HBr at 5.4 mg/kg were better than 1.8 mg/kg and atropine. Therefore, Ani HBr alleviates acute lung injury in septic rats, which provides evidence supporting the clinical therapy of lung injury by Ani HBr.","Zeng, Ye Du Xiaoqiang Jiang Wenli Qiu Yan",The FASEB Journal,,426

We use the situation in Zimbabwe to build an argument that the epidemic is likely to be attenuated in some countries with similar socioeconomic and cultural structures. However, even an attenuated epidemic may overwhelm weak health systems, emphasizing the importance of prevention. These prevention strategies should be tailored to the unique social and cultural networks of individual countries, which may facilitate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. It is also equally important to maintain services for the major infectious diseases in the region, such as tuberculosis and malaria. A breakdown of treatment and prevention services for these conditions may even overshadow the projected morbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Katsidzira, Leolin; Gwaunza, Lenon; Hakim, James G",Clin Infect Dis,,426

494747,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Spectrum of Performed Dental Procedures,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on patients' perceptions of hardship in obtaining their drugs and if this pandemic and the social restrictions in response to that has resulted in any changes in their seizure control status. We also investigated factors potentially associated with the perceptions of difficulty in obtaining their drugs (eg, polytherapy vs monotherapy, taking imported drugs, and seizure status worsening). METHODS: We surveyed a random sample of patients with epilepsy, who were registered in our database at Shiraz Epilepsy Center, Iran, on their perceptions on two issues: (a) What has been your experience on obtaining your antiseizure medications in the past 4 weeks (compared to before)? (b) Have you experienced any changes in your seizure control status in the past 4 weeks? RESULTS: We included 100 patients (53 male and 47 female patients). In response to the question ""Have you had any difficulties in the past 4 weeks to obtain your drugs?,"" 31 people (31%) expressed hardship obtaining their drugs. In response to the question ""How has been your seizure control status compared with before?,"" six people (6%) expressed worsening of their seizure control status in the past 4 weeks. None of the patients reported symptoms of coronavirus infection. CONCLUSION: About one-third of patients with epilepsy expressed significant hardship obtaining their drugs after the intensification of the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran. The current COVID-19 pandemic could be considered as a major shock to a nation that has already been under significant pressure (ie, Iran).","Asadi-Pooya, Ali A; Farazdaghi, Mohsen; Bazrafshan, Mehdi",Acta neurol. scand,,426
495936,Spatial Variability in COVID-19 Mortality,2021,"Subunit vaccines induce immunity to a pathogen by presenting a component of the pathogen and thus inherently limit the representation of pathogen peptides for cellular immunity-based memory. We find that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) subunit peptides may not be robustly displayed by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules in certain individuals. We introduce an augmentation strategy for subunit vaccines that adds a small number of SARS-CoV-2 peptides to a vaccine to improve the population coverage of pathogen peptide display. Our population coverage estimates integrate clinical data on peptide immunogenicity in convalescent COVID-19 patients and machine learning predictions. We evaluate the population coverage of 9 different subunits of SARS-CoV-2, including 5 functional domains and 4 full proteins, and augment each of them to fill a predicted coverage gap.","Liu, Ge; Carter, Brandon; Gifford, David K",Cell Syst,,426

497425,Factors Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Physician Trainees in New York City during the First COVID-19 Wave,2021,"The role of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems (HVAC) in spreading SARSCoV-2 is a complex topic and has not been studied thoroughly. There are some existing strategies and technologies for health and high performance buildings;however, applications to other types of buildings come at large energy penalty: cost;design, regulations and standards changes, and varied public perception. In the present work, different factors and strategies are reviewed and discussed and suggested mitigations and solutions are provided including the required air flowrates with the presence of infectors with and without mask and disinfection techniques including ultraviolet (UV) light. Experimental and numerical research in open literature suggests that the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is sufficiently likely. However, in situ detailed experimental studies are still needed to understand the different scenarios of the virus spread. Displacement ventilation, underfloor air distribution, chilled beams, radiant ceiling panels, and laminar flow systems have varied effectiveness. High-efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filters and UV light can clean viruses but at high energy cost. Suggested solutions to reduce the infection probability include recommended levels of ventilation and a combination of virus sampling technologies including cyclones, liquid impinger, filters, electrostatic precipitators, and water-based condensation. © 2020 by ASME.","Sleiti, A.

However, less is known about the use of telemedicine in sports and exercise medicine (teleSEM) and its utility to treat emergent craniofacial injuries. Given how common facial trauma is among athletes and its possible complications, incorporation of telemedicine in sports-related injuries may prove to be quintessential for athletes and coaches. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of the MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted for studies published through December 2020 with multiple search terms related to telemedicine in sports and trauma care. RESULTS: Overall, teleSEM is appreciated by both patients and physicians alike. Studies show that the satisfaction rate among patients and physicians are high. Sports-related telemedicine visits can help improve resource utilization and total costs. Facial trauma studies also reveal that the level of concurrency of treatment options between telemedicine visits and in-person consultations is almost perfect. Further, there are many additional ways that teleSEM can be implemented in treating injured athletes, including possible collaboration between athletic coaches and physicians as well as mobile device applications. Telemedicine may be particularly useful in treating acute injuries in low-resourced areas with limited equipment and training. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine has been widely employed for sports-related injuries and in traumatic care. Patients and providers alike have noted its utility over other methods of communication with physicians. Our findings suggest that telemedicine has a significant potential in treating sports-related injuries and improving the efficiency of diagnoses and treatments. It may enhance outcomes for participants in athletic events. This may become a key aspect of determining whether a player can return to immediate competition.","Tam, Anson; Plotsker, Ethan; Kim, Minji; Thaller, Seth R",J. craniofac. surg,,426

498552,The Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions on Mental Well-Being and Working Life among Faroese Employees,2021,"BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is an important time for developing attitudes and beliefs about childhood vaccinations. Vaccinations are among the most effective way of preventing some infectious diseases. Discussions on vaccinations have increased due to the Covid-19 pandemic and there is an opportunity to give society correct information on vaccinations. AIM: The aim of the study was to determine the opinions of pregnant women on vaccinations in pregnancy and childhood and the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on these views. METHODS: The study was conducted as a cross-sectional study. The sample included 152 pregnant women. Data were collected through a 25-item online questionnaire created by the researchers. RESULTS: It was found in our study that 29.6% of pregnant women using forum websites exhibited hesitant attitudes towards vaccinations. The vaccine hesitancy rate was found to be high in pregnant women who said that their economic level was low and who worried about the risks of vaccination. The Covid-19 pandemic was reported to be the cause of a decrease in vaccine hesitancy in 28.9% of the participants. CONCLUSION: The events surrounding the pandemic provided an opportunity to explain how pregnant women feel about vaccinations. Providing pregnant women with access to correct information from health workers may reduce the problem of trust, which is among the most important reasons for vaccine hesitancy.","Gencer, Hatice; Özkan, Sevgi; Vardar, Okan; Serçekus, Pinar",Women and birth (Online),,426

498799,"Dissociation, Cognitive Reflection and Health Literacy Have a Modest Effect on Belief in Conspiracy Theories about COVID-19",2021,"Oncologic patients are regarded as the population most at risk of developing a severe course of COVID-19 due to the fact that malignant diseases and chemotherapy often weaken the immune system. In the face of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, how particular patients deal with this infection remains an important question. In the period between the 15 and 26 April 2020, a total of 1227 patients were tested in one of seven oncologic outpatient clinics for SARS-CoV-2, regardless of symptoms, employing RT-qPCR. Of 1227 patients, 78 (6.4%) were tested positive of SARS-CoV-2. Only one of the patients who tested positive developed a severe form of COVID-19 with pneumonia (CURB-65 score of 2), and two patients showed mild symptoms. Fourteen of 75 asymptomatic but positively tested patients received chemotherapy or chemo-immunotherapy according to their regular therapy algorithm (±4 weeks of SARS-CoV-2 test), and 48 of 78 (61.5%) positive-tested patients received glucocorticoids as co-medication. None of the asymptomatic infected patients showed unexpected complications due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection during the cancer treatment. These data clearly contrast the view that patients with an oncologic disease are particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that compromising therapies could be continued or started despite the ongoing pandemic. Moreover the relatively low appearance of symptoms due to COVID-19 among patients on chemotherapy and other immunosuppressive co-medication like glucocorticoids indicate that suppressing the response capacity of the immune system reduces disease severity.","Hempel, Louisa; Piehler, Armin; Pfaffl, Michael W; Molnar, Jakob; Kirchner, Benedikt; Robert, Sebastian; Veloso, Julia; Gandorfer, Beate; Trepotec, Zeljka; Mederle, Stefanie; Keim, Sabine; Milani, Valeria; Ebner, Florian; Schweneker, Katrin; Fleischmann, Bastian; Kleespies, Axel; Scheiber, Josef; Hempel, Dirk; Zehn, Dietmar",Cancer Med,,426

499404,Untying the Precise Impact of COVID-19 Policy on Social Distancing Behavior,2021,"Pancreatic cancer will gradually become the second leading cause of cancer death due to its poor suitability for surgical treatment, frequent recurrence and metastasis, and insensitivity to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Strategies for precise early detection and effective targeted treatment of pancreatic cancer are urgently needed. Because of its unique advantages, molecular targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging (CEUI) has generated new opportunities to overcome this challenge. The aim of this study was to explore multifunctional nanobubbles named IR780-NBs-DTX as novel ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) for dual-mode targeted imaging and photothermal ablation combined with chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer. An optimized ""film hydration method"" was used to prepare IR780-NBs-DTX in this research. The characteristics and ability of the new UCAs were detected via in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo experiments. The initial dose of 0.15 mg IR-780 iodide/1.0 mg DTX was considered to be the best formula for IR780-NBs-DTX, and the concentration of 6 ×106 bubbles/mL was best for CEUI. The excellent characteristics of IR780-NBs-DTX, including a uniform nanoscale particle size (349.8± 159.1 nm, n= 3), good performance in dual-mode imaging, high stability and reliable biocompatibility, were also proven. In the in vitro cell experiments, IR780-NBs-DTX targeted more pancreatic cancer cells than the control treatments, and the targeting rate was approximately 95.6± 1.7%. Under irradiation with an 808 nm laser, most cells died. Furthermore, the in vivo study demonstrated that IR780-NBs-DTX could precisely detect pancreatic cancer through near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging and CEUI, and the tumor almost disappeared at 18 days after combined treatment. In ex vivo experiments, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) showed that the expression of HSP70 increased and that of PCNA decreased, and many apoptotic tumor cells were observed by TUNEL staining in the IR780-NBs-DTX group. The newly prepared IR780-NBs-DTX are novel nanosized UCAs with high efficiency for dual-mode molecular targeted imaging and combined therapy, and they may have future potential applications in the precise detection and effective targeted therapy of small and metastatic lesions in the early stage of pancreatic cancer.","Yang, Hengli; Zhao, Ping; Zhou, Yonggang; Li, Qiaoying; Cai, Wenbin; Zhao, Zongxia; Shen, Jian; Yao, Kechun; Duan, Yunyou",Sci Rep,,426

Vaccine shortage and practical deployment rates on the field necessitate prioritization. The global strategy has been to prioritize those with high personal risk due to their age or comorbidities, and those who constitute the essential workforce of the society. Rather than a systematic age-based rolldown, assigning the next priority requires a local strategy based on vaccine availability, effectiveness of the specific vaccines, population size as well as its age demographics and the scenario of how the pandemic is likely to develop. The adult (20-60 yrs) - senior (over 60 yrs) duo from a multigenerational home presents a high-risk demographic. The estimated 'effective age' of an adult living with a grandparent who is not vaccinated may be up to 40 years higher. The proposed model suggests that strategically vaccinating the adults from multigenerational homes in India may be effective in saving the lives of around 70,000 to 200,000 seniors, under the different epidemiological scenarios possible with or without strict lockdowns.

504637,"Relations between Air Quality and Covid-19 Lockdown Measures in Valencia, Spain",2021,"Since early 2020, global stakeholders have highlighted the significant gendered consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, including increases in the risk of gender-based violence (GBV). Researchers have sought to inform the pandemic response through a diverse set of methodologies, including early efforts modelling anticipated increases in GBV. For example, in April 2020, a highly cited modelling effort by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and partners projected headline global figures of 31 million additional cases of intimate partner violence due to 6 months of lockdown, and an additional 13 million child marriages by 2030. In this paper, we discuss the rationale for using modelling to make projections about GBV, and use the projections released by UNFPA to draw attention to the assumptions and biases underlying model-based projections. We raise five key critiques: (1) reducing complex issues to simplified, linear cause-effect relationships, (2) reliance on a small number of studies to generate global estimates, (3) assuming that the pandemic results in the complete service disruption for existing interventions, (4) lack of clarity in indicators used and sources of estimates, and (5) failure to account for margins of uncertainty. We argue that there is a need to consider the motivations and consequences of using modelling data as a planning tool for complex issues like GBV, and conclude by suggesting key considerations for policymakers and practitioners in using and commissioning such projections.","Lokot, Michelle; Bhatia, Amiya; Heidari, Shirin; Peterman, Amber",,,426
504743,"How to Defend COVID-19 in Taiwan? Talk about People's Disease Awareness, Attitudes, Behaviors and the Impact of Physical and Mental Health",2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has become a worldwide pandemic impacting child protection services (CPSs) in many countries. With quarantine and social distancing restrictions, school closures, and recreational venues suspended or providing reduced access, the social safety net for violence prevention has been disrupted significantly. Impacts include the concerns of underreporting and increased risk of child abuse and neglect, as well as challenges in operating CPSs and keeping their workforce safe. OBJECTIVE: The current discussion paper explored the impact of COVID-19 on child maltreatment reports and CPS responses by comparing countries using available population data. METHOD: Information was gathered from researchers in eight countries, including contextual information about the country's demographics and economic situation, key elements of the CPS, and the CPS response to COVID-19. Where available, information about other factors affecting children was also collected. These data informed a discussion about between-country similarities and differences. RESULTS: COVID-19 had significant impact on the operation of every CPS, whether in high- income or low-income countries. Most systems encountered some degree of service disruption or change. Risk factors for children appeared to increase while there were often substantial deficits in CPS responses, and in most countries there was at a temporary decrease in CM reports despite the increased risks to children. CONCLUSIONS: The initial data presented and discussed among the international teams pointed to the way COVID-19 has hampered CPS responses and the protection of children more generally in most jurisdictions, highlighting that children appear to have been at greater risk for maltreatment during COVID-19.","Katz, Ilan; Katz, Carmit; Andresen, Sabine; Bérubé, Annie; Collin-Vezina, Delphine; Fallon, Barbara; Fouché, Ansie; Haffejee, Sadiyya; Masrawa, Nadia; Muñoz, Pablo; Priolo Filho, Sidnei R; Tarabulsy, George; Truter, Elmien; Varela, Natalia; Wekerle, Christine",Child Abuse Negl,,426
505136,Cardiovascular Comorbidities and Pharmacological Treatments of COVID-19 Patients Not Requiring Hospitalization,2020,"Background: The COVID-19 outbreak, which was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, began to spread throughout the world, and now involves over 200 countries. Methods: A total of 37 overseas young and middle-aged people, who tested as SARS-CoV-2 positive upon their return to Shanghai, were enrolled for an analysis of their clinical symptoms, blood routine indexes, and lung CT images. Results: The clinical symptoms were characterized by fever (51.4%), dry cough (13.5%), expectoration (27.0%), hypodynamia (21.6%), pharyngalia (10.8%), pharynoxerosis (8.1%), rhinobyon (13.5%), rhinorrhea (8.1%), muscular soreness (16.2%), and diarrhea (2.7%). In 16.2% of cases, no symptoms were reported. Fever was the most common symptom (51.40%). The pneumonic changes referred to the latticed ground glass imaging and similar white lung imaging accompanied by consolidated shadows. The rate of pneumonia was high (81.10%). We found that the exclusive percent of eosinophils was abnormally low. By analyzing the correlation of eosinophils, fever, and pneumonia, we found that the percentage of eosinophils was low in the COVID-19 patients afflicted with fever or pneumonia (P &lt; 0.01). Additionally, pneumonia and fever were negatively correlated with the percentage of eosinophils and eosinophils/neutrophils ratio (P &lt; 0.01, respectively), but not associated with pneumonia severity (P &gt; 0.05). Fever was not correlated with pneumonia (P &gt; 0.05). Conclusion: A low percentage of eosinophils may be considered as a biomarker of pneumonia of COVID-19, but not as a biomarker of pneumonia severity.","Yang, Juan; Zhao, Xiaohui; Liu, Xueyuan; Sun, Wanju; Zhou, Longzhu; Wang, Yongbing; Sui, Haijing",Front.

505747,The Mediating Role of Internalized Stigma and Shame on the Relationship between COVID-19 Related Discrimination and Mental Health Outcomes among Back-to-School Students in Wuhan,2020,"BACKGROUND: Homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD) is a frequent feature of high-grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal carcinoma (HGSC) and is associated with sensitivity to PARP inhibitor (PARPi) therapy. HRD testing provides an opportunity to optimise PARPi use in HGSC but methodologies are diverse and clinical application remains controversial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To define best practice for HRD testing in HGSC the ESMO Translational Research and Precision Medicine Working Group launched a collaborative project that incorporated a systematic review approach. The main aims were to (i) define the term 'HRD test'; (ii) provide an overview of the biological rationale and the level of evidence supporting currently available HRD tests; (iii) provide recommendations on the clinical utility of HRD tests in clinical management of HGSC. RESULTS: A broad range of repair genes, genomic scars, mutational signatures and functional assays are associated with a history of HRD. Currently, the clinical validity of HRD tests in ovarian cancer is best assessed, not in terms of biological HRD status per se, but in terms of PARPi benefit. Clinical trials evidence supports the use of BRCA mutation testing and two commercially available assays that also incorporate genomic instability for identifying subgroups of HGSCs that derive different magnitudes of benefit from PARPi therapy, albeit with some variation by clinical scenario. These tests can be used to inform treatment selection and scheduling but their use is limited by a failure to consistently identify a subgroup of patients who derive no benefit from PARPis in most studies. Existing tests lack negative predictive value and inadequately address the complex and dynamic nature of the HRD phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Currently available HRD tests are useful for predicting likely magnitude of benefit from PARPis but better biomarkers are urgently needed to better identify current homologous recombination proficiency status and stratify HGSC management.","Miller, R E; Leary, A; Scott, C L; Serra, V; Lord, C J; Bowtell, D; Chang, D K; Garsed, D W; Jonkers, J; Ledermann, J A; Nik-Zainal, S; Ray-Coquard, I; Shah, S P; Matias-Guiu, X; Swisher, E M; Yates, L R",Ann. oncol,,426

We want to confirm the potential mechanisms, including reduced phosphorylation of AKT/MAPK pathways, as well as enhanced CD8+ T-cell-mediated antitumor immune response. To clarify the mechanism of propranolol activity in colorectal cancer, the therapeutic activity of propranolol was then assessed in CT26WT tumors engrafted in BALB/C mice. Then the effect of propranolol treatment was also examined by randomizing patients undergoing surgical resection of a previously untreated colorectal cancer to propranolol or placebo group and treated for 1 week prior to surgery. CT26WT tumor size was smaller after propranolol than vehicle control. Propranolol downregulated the expression of p-AKT/p-ERK/p-MEK in tumor tissue. The frequency of tumor CD8+ T cells was significantly elevated in propranolol-treated mice. The expression of GzmB/IFN-Î³/T-bet in the CD8+ T-cell population was significantly increased in propranolol treated mice tumor tissue. In propranolol-treated surgical specimens, the expression of p-ERK was decreased and the frequency of CD8+ was significantly elevated. The expression of GzmB in the CD8+ T-cell population was significantly increased in propranolol-treated subjects. Together these data show propranolol simultaneously activating autologous CD8+ T cells and decreasing the expression of p-AKT/p-ERK/p-MEK in mouse tumor models, while inhibiting the expression of p-ERK in clinical colorectal cancer. Effort is now needed to further dissect whether both pathways are required for anti-tumor effect, as the activity of this old drug is moved forward.","Liao, Ping; Song, Kun; Zhu, Zhanwei; Liu, Zhaoqian; Zhang, Wei; Li, Wei; Hu, Jiali; Hu, Qian; Chen, Cuiyu; Chen, Bohua; McLeod, Howard L; Pei, Haiping; Chen, Ling; He, Yijing",Clin. pharmacol. ther,,426
509854,Knowledge and Practices during the COVID-19 Outbreak in the Middle East: A Cross-Sectional Study,2021,"In spite of numerous studies, many details of SARS-Cov-2 interaction with human cells are still poorly understood. The 674-685 fragment of SARS-Cov-2 spike protein is homologous to the fragment of &#945;-cobratoxin underlying its interaction with &#945;7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). The interaction of 674-685 peptide with &#945;7 nAChR has been predicted in silico. In the present paper we confirm this prediction experimentally and investigate the effect of SARS-Cov-2 spike protein peptide on mitochondria, which express &#945;7 nAChRs to regulate apoptosis-related events. We demonstrate that SARS-Cov-2 spike protein peptide 674-685 competes with the antibody against 179-190 fragment of &#945;7 nAChR subunit for the binding to &#945;7-expressing cells and mitochondria and prevents the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria in response to 0.5 mM H2O2 but does not protect intact U373 cells against apoptogenic effect of H2O2. Our data suggest that the &#945;7 nAChR-binding portion of SARS-Cov-2 spike protein prevents mitochondria-driven apoptosis when the virus is uncoated inside the cell and, therefore, supports the infected cell viability before the virus replication cycle is complete.","Kalashnyk, Olena; Lykhmus, Olena; Izmailov, Mykhailo; Koval, Lyudmyla; Komisarenko, Serhiy; Skok, Maryna",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,426

The ORF7a protein has a structural homology with ICAM-1 which binds to the T lymphocyte integrin receptor LFA-1. As COVID19 has a strong immune component as part of the disease, we sought to determine whether SARS-CoV2 would have a similar structural interaction with LFA-1. Using molecular docking simulations, we found that SARS-CoV2 ORF7a has the key structural determinants required to bind LFA-1 but also the related leukocyte integrin Mac-1, which is also known to be expressed by macrophages. Our study shows that SARS-CoV2 ORF7a protein has a conserved Ig immunoglobulin-like fold containing an integrin binding site that provides a mechanistic hypothesis for SARS-CoV2's interaction with the human immune system. This suggests that experimental investigation of ORF7a mediated effects on immune cells such as T lymphocytes and macrophages (leukocytes) could help understand the disease further and develop effective treatments.","Nizamudeen, Zubair A; Xu, Emma-Ruoqi; Karthik, Vivin; Halawa, Mohamed; Arkill, Kenton P; Jackson, Andrew; Bates, David O; Elmsley, Jonas",Biosci. rep,,426

CCAAT/enhancer binding protein ß/asparagine endopeptidase (C/EBPß/AEP) signaling spatiotemporally mediates AD pathologies in the brain via cleaving both ß-amyloid precursor protein and Tau. We show that gut dysbiosis occurs in 5xFAD mice, and is associated with escalation of the C/EBPß/AEP pathway in the gut with age. Unlike that of aged wild-type mice, the microbiota of aged 3xTg mice accelerate AD pathology in young 3xTg mice, accompanied by active C/EBPß/AEP signaling in the brain. Antibiotic treatment diminishes this signaling and attenuates amyloidogenic processes in 5xFAD, improving cognitive functions. The prebiotic R13 inhibits this pathway and suppresses amyloid aggregates in the gut. R13-induced Lactobacillus salivarius antagonizes the C/EBPß/AEP axis, mitigating gut leakage and oxidative stress. Our findings support the hypothesis that C/EBPß/AEP signaling is activated by gut dysbiosis, implicated in AD pathologies in the gut.","Chen, Chun; Ahn, Eun Hee; Kang, Seong Su; Liu, Xia; Alam, Ashfaqul; Ye, Keqiang",Sci.

514521,"Nationwide Survey in Greece about Knowledge, Risk Perceptions, and Preventive Behaviors for COVID-19 during the General Lockdown in April 2020",2020,"Tobacco smoking is a leading cause of non-communicable disease globally and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and lung disease. Importantly, recent data by the World Health Organizations (WHO) indicate that in the last two decades global tobacco use has significantly dropped, which was largely driven by decreased numbers of female smokers. Despite such advances, the use of e-cigarettes and waterpipes (shisha, hookah, narghile) is an emerging trend, especially among younger generations. There is growing body of evidence that e-cigarettes are not a harm-free alternative to tobacco cigarettes and there is considerable debate as to whether e-cigarettes are saving smokers or generating new addicts. Here, we provide an updated overview of the impact of tobacco/waterpipe (shisha) smoking and e-cigarette vaping on endothelial function, a biomarker for early, subclinical, atherosclerosis from human and animal studies. Also their emerging adverse effects on the proteome, transcriptome, epigenome, microbiome, and the circadian clock are summarized. We briefly discuss heat-not-burn tobacco products and their cardiovascular health effects. We discuss the impact of the toxic constituents of these products on endothelial function and subsequent CVD and we also provide an update on current recommendations, regulation and advertising with focus on the USA and Europe. As outlined by the WHO, tobacco cigarette, waterpipe, and e-cigarette smoking/vaping may contribute to an increased burden of symptoms due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to severe health consequences.","Münzel, Thomas; Hahad, Omar; Kuntic, Marin; Keaney, John F; Deanfield, John E; Daiber, Andreas",Eur Heart J,,426

SUMMARY: After a retrospective review of vasopressin utilization over a 4-month period revealed that only approximately 40% of dispensed vasopressin units were actually administered to patients, pharmacy leaders determined that the institution's standard vasopressin concentration for continuous infusions (100 units in 100 mL of sodium chloride 0.9% injection) was resulting in substantial waste, as many infusion preparations were not needed within the 18- to 24-hour expiration window. A concentration of 20 units/100 mL was adopted as the new standard formulation for vasopressin continuous infusions, with use of alternative concentrations allowed on a restricted basis. A pre-post study to assess the impact of the formulation change indicated a 38.7% decrease in vasopressin utilization (from 21,900 to 8,480 units) relative to utilization in a retrospective sample of patients who received vasopressin infusions prior to the formulation change. This reduced utilization equated to a cost decrease of $55,656.20 (as calculated on the basis of 2017 cost estimates) or $77,214.23 (as calculated on the basis of 2019 cost estimates) for the time period collected. It was estimated that the new formulations could yield annual cost savings ranging from $222,625 to $308,857. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first description of cost savings following a change in formulation of vasopressin for continuous infusions. Other institutions could consider employing a similar approach in addition to the previously reported cost-saving interventions, such as lower vasopressin starting doses and vasopressin restriction policies.","Kelly, Courtney E; Miller, Christopher; Darko, William; Cwikla, Greg; Mogle, Bryan; Featherly, Julianna; Marcinak, Rebecca; Probst, Luke A; Seabury, Robert",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,426

519585,COVID-19 Home Confinement Negatively Impacts Social Participation and Life Satisfaction: A Worldwide Multicenter Study,2020,"Social distancing resulting from the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) has disrupted the airplane boarding process. Social distancing norms reduce airplane capacity by keeping the middle seats unoccupied, while an imposed aisle social distance between boarding passengers slows the boarding. Recent literature suggests the Reverse Pyramid boarding method is a promising way to reduce health risk and keep boarding times low when 10 apron buses (essentially 10 boarding groups) are used to transport passengers from the airport terminal to a two-door airplane. We adapt the Reverse Pyramid method for social distancing when an airplane is boarded using a jet bridge that connects the terminal the airplane's front door. We vary the number of boarding groups from two to six and use stochastic simulation and agent-based modelling to show the resulting impact on four performance evaluation metrics. Increasing the number of boarding groups from two to six reduces boarding time only up to four groups but continues to reduce infection risk up to six groups. If the passengers carry fewer luggage aboard the airplane, health risks (as well as boarding times) decrease. One adaptation of the Reverse Pyramid (RP) method (RP-Spread) provides slightly faster boarding times than the other (RP-Steep), when luggage volumes are high, while RP-Steep results in less risk to window seat passengers from later-boarding passengers walking by their row. Increasing the minimum aisle social distance from 1 m to 2 m increases boarding times but results in lower health risks to passengers walking down the aisle and to the previously seated passengers they pass.","Milne, R John; Cotfas, Liviu-Adrian; Delcea, Camelia; Craciun, Liliana; Molanescu, Anca-Gabriela",PLoS One,,426

We focused on 2-oxonicotinonitrile (2-ONN) as derivative of the natural product 2-pyridinone. Herein, we describe the synthesis of 2-ONNs bearing two aryl groups, which we coupled with organohalides, including three glycosyl bromides, to prepare the nucleoside analogues. Coupling occurred mostly at the 2-ONN ring nitrogen to give the aimed targets, and in a few cases, it happened at the 2-oxo position giving O-alkylation products. Free 2-ONNs and their acetylated nucleosides were tested against a number of viruses. The nucleoside analogue 2a(Ac) showed good anti SARS-CoV and anti influenza A (H(5)N(1)) activities.

591672,Untying the Precise Impact of COVID-19 Policy on Social Distancing Behavior,2021-01-21,"PURPOSE: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in young children. However, there are limited data on severe RSV infection requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. This retrospective study described features of RSV-associated PICU admissions in Hong Kong and investigated factors for mortality and duration of PICU stay. METHODS: Children with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection and admitted to the PICUs of all eight government hospitals in Hong Kong between January 2009 and June 2011 were identified from computerized auditing systems and PICU databases. RSV in respiratory samples was detected by direct immunofluorescence and/or viral culture. The relationships between mortality and PICU duration and demographic and clinical factors were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 118 (2.4 %) PICU admissions were identified among 4,912 RSV-positive pediatric cases in all hospitals. Sixty-five (55.6 %) patients were infants. PICU admissions were higher between October and March. Eight (6.8 %) patients died, but only two were infants. RSV-associated mortality was related to prior sick contact, presence of older siblings, neurodevelopmental conditions, chromosomal and genetic diseases, and bacterial co-infections, but none was significant following logistic regression analyses (odds ratio 9.36, 95 % confidence interval 0.91–96.03 for prior sick contact, p = 0.060). Chronic lung disease was the only risk factor for the duration of PICU admission (β = 0.218, p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of RSV-infected children do not require PICU support. There is winter seasonality for RSV-associated PICU admission in Hong Kong. Prior sick contact is the only risk factor for RSV-associated mortality, whereas the presence of chronic lung disease is associated with longer PICU stay. The current risk-based approach of RSV prophylaxis may not be effective in reducing severe RSV infections.","Leung, T. F.; Lam, D. S. Y.; Miu, T. Y.; Hon, K. L.; Chau, C. S. K.; Ku, S. W.; Lee, R. S.

The vaccine candidate elicited strong antigenicity in dogs in respect of specific SGE and Leishmania humoral immune response. The major saliva proteins recognized by serum from immunized dogs exhibited molecular weights of 35 and 45 kDa, and were related to the resistance pattern against Leishmania infection. Immunophenotypic analysis revealed increased circulating CD21(+) B-cells and CD5(+) T-cells, reflected by higher counts of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells. The observed interaction between potential antigen-presenting cells (evaluated as CD14(+) monocytes) and lymphocyte activation status indicated a relationship between innate and adaptive immune responses. The higher frequency in L. chagasi antigen-specific CD8(+) T-lymphocytes, and their positive association with intense cell proliferation, in addition to the progressively higher production of serum nitric oxide levels, showed a profile compatible with anti-CVL vaccine potential. Further studies on immunological response after challenge with L. chagasi may provide important information that will lead to a better understanding on vaccine trial and efficacy.","Giunchetti, Rodolfo Cordeiro; Corrêa-Oliveira, Rodrigo; Martins-Filho, Olindo Assis; Teixeira-Carvalho, Andréa; Roatt, Bruno Mendes; Aguiar-Soares, Rodrigo Dian de Oliveira; Coura-Vital, Wendel; Abreu, Raquel Tropia de; Malaquias, Luiz Cosme Cotta; Gontijo, Nelder Figueiredo; Brodskyn, Cláudia; Oliveira, Camila Indiani de; Costa, Dirceu Joaquim; de Lana, Marta; Reis, Alexandre Barbosa",Vaccine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X07013758; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18180079/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X07013758; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2007.11.057,426

Methods: A total of 439 specimens were longitudinally collected from 76 healthcare workers with RT-PCR-confirmed mild COVID-19. Nine serological assays developed by leading global companies (Abbott, DiaSorin, Siemens, Bio-Rad, Wantai, bioMerieux, Euroimmun) were assessed. For each test the sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was determined weekly after symptom onset. Correlation and concordance were assessed using the Spearman and Cohen Kappa coefficients, respectively. Positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement (NPA) with the VNT were also determined. Results: The Wantai Total Ab assay targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) within the S protein presented the best sensitivity at different times during the course of disease. The best correlation between antibody level and neutralizing antibody titer was found with the Euroimmun S1-based IgA assay (Spearman coefficient [95%CI]: 0.71 [0.61-0.79]). A moderate concordance (Kappa [95%CI]: 0.43[0.23-0.63]) as well as the lowest NPA (33%) was found between the Wantai Total Ab assay and the VNT. Compared to the Wantai Total Ab assay, other total Ab or IgG assays targeting the S or the RBD (bioMerieux, DiaSorin, Siemens,) were more concordant with the VNT (Kappa>0.7 for the three tests) and had a higher NPA (range: 90% to 97%). Conclusions: Although some assays presented a better concordance with VNT than others, the present findings emphasize that commercialized serological tests including those targeting the RBD cannot substitute VNT for the assessment of functional antibody response.","Bal, A.; Pozzetto, B.; Trabaud, M.-A.; Escuret, V.; Rabilloud, M.; Langlois-jacques, C.; Paul, A.; Guibert, N.; D'aubarde, C.; Massardier, A.; Boibieux, A.; Morfin, F.; Pitiot, V.; Gueyffier, F.; Lina, B.; Fassier, J.

I reflect on the role of the archetypal Self during times of existential anxiety that may lead to an experience of ‘essential anxiety’. This term refers to a meeting by a fearful ego with an inward recognition of the Self, when faced with threat. The efforts to curb the spread of the pandemic changed our ways of life, while the virus itself threatened our existence in debilitating or outright destructive ways. But what also came into view, in sessions of analysis and supervision, was the creative instinct, and a celebration of life. The soul‐to‐soul relationship, and the connection with images of the archetypal Self, made the experience of existential anxiety at times an essential experience that facilitated psychological growth. I discuss some advantages of on‐line Jungian analysis where, despite distance and partial view, the body still serves as container to hold important psychological material, conferring a sense of wholeness for analyst and analysand. The COVID‐19 crisis is terrible and terrifying but it also provides an opportunity for self‐regulation and individuation.","Schellinski, Kristina",J Anal Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34231893/; https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-5922.12690,426

We aimed to compare and describe the liver biomarkers in different subtypes of COVID-19 patients. Methods: This study enrolled 288 COVID-19 patients in Huangshi Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. All patients were divided into ordinary, severe, and critical groups according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7). Demographic, clinical characteristics and liver biomarkers were compared among the three groups. Results: During hospitalization, AST, TBiL, and ALP levels in ordinary and severe patients fluctuated within the normal range with a rising trend in critical patients except AST. ALT and GGT levels fluctuated within the normal range showing an upward trend, while LDH levels in the critical group exceeded the normal range. Prealbumin showed an upward trend, especially in the severe group. At discharge, AST and LDH levels in ordinary and severe groups were lower than their baselines but increased in the critical group. In contrast to albumin, TBiL levels were increased in ordinary and critical groups while decreased in the severe group. The stratified analysis revealed factors affecting liver function in critical cases included highest temperature ≥38.0°C, age ≥60 and symptom of hypoxemia. Conclusions: COVID-19 can cause severe hepatic dysfunction in critical patients, requiring early monitoring and intervention. LDH, ALP, GGT, TBiL, prealbumin, and albumin may be helpful for evaluating and predicting disease prognosis due to their correlation with disease severity in COVID-19.","Fan, Haozhi; Cai, Jinyuan; Tian, Anran; Li, Yuwen; Yuan, Hui; Jiang, Zhengyi; Yu, Yunxi; Ruan, Lili; Hu, Pingping; Yue, Ming; Chen, Nian; Li, Jun; Zhu, Chuanlong",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33521010/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.584888,426

Current studies reported that the cytokine/chemokine network is crucial in the onset and maintenance of the “cytokine storm”, the event occurring in those patients in whom the progression of COVID-19 will progress, in most cases, to a very severe and potentially threatening disease. Detecting a possible “immune signature” in patients, as assessed by chemokines status in patients with COVID-19, could be helpful for individual risk stratification for developing a more or less severe clinical course of the disease. The present review is specifically aimed at overviewing current evidences provided by in vitro and in vivo studies addressing the issue of which chemokines seems to be involved, at least at present, in COVID-19. Currently available experimental and clinical studies regarding those chemokines more deeply studied in COVID-19, with a specific focus on their role in the cytokine storm and ultimately with their ability to predict the clinical course of the disease, will be taken into account. Moreover, similarities and differences between chemokines and cytokines, which both contribute to the onset of the pro-inflammatory loop characterizing SARS-COV-2 infection, will be briefly discussed. Future studies will rapidly accumulate in the next months and their results will hopefully provide more insights as to the complex physiopathology of COVID-19-related cytokine storm. This will likely make the present review somehow “dated” in a short time, but still the present review provides an overview of the scenario of the current knowledge on this topic.","Coperchini, Francesca; Chiovato, Luca; Ricci, Gianluca; Croce, Laura; Magri, Flavia; Rotondi, Mario",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359610120302422?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359610120302422; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cytogfr.2020.12.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33573850/,426

Despite this, there exists a dearth of literature comprehensively assessing the knowledge and awareness of these health-care workers on the disease in the Kingdom of Bahrain. This study was designed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of emergency physicians in the Kingdom of Bahrain towards COVID-19. METHODS: This cross-sectional descriptive study included 142 emergency physicians from three major hospitals in Bahrain. A self-designed questionnaire divided into 4 parts, which consists of demographics, knowledge, attitude and practices towards COVID-19, was completed by the emergency physicians working in these hospitals. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), t-test, chi-square test, and multiple linear regression were employed to evaluate KAP scores. RESULTS: The mean COVID-19 knowledge and practice score was 26.29 for a maximum score of 32 suggesting an overall 82.15% correct rate on the knowledge and practice test. Multiple linear regression analysis highlighted age (p=0.038), genders (p=0.033), marital status (p=0.021), organization (p=0.032), having children (p=0.008), and continuing professional development (CPD) activity (p=0.0001) as significant predictors for knowledge and practice scores. The attitude towards the final success in controlling COVID-19 significantly differed across marital status (p=0.021), organization of participants (p=0.020) and position of participants (p=0.012), respectively. CONCLUSION: Adequate knowledge, positive attitude and sufficient safe practice towards COVID-19 were observed in majority of the participants. These findings can foster development of nuanced and salient health management strategies that augment KAP so that proper control and elimination of the disease can be achieved, while prioritizing patient health and satisfaction.","Alghanem, Salah; Alqassim, Ghada; Abuzeyad, Feras; Isa, Ruqaya; Falamarzi, Horeya",Open Access Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.2147/oaem.s323268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548822/,426

There is, however, little evidence of the effects of vitamin D on hospitalisation among older adults. This study aimed to prospectively determine the relationship of vitamin D status in older adults with hospital admission and emergency department (ED) attendance. Trinity University of Ulster Department of Agriculture (TUDA) is a large cross-sectional study of older adults with a community population from three disease-defined cohorts (cognitive dysfunction, hypertension, and osteoporosis). Participants included in this analysis were recruited between 2008 and 2012. ED and hospital admission data were gathered from the date of TUDA participation until June 2013, with a mean follow up of 3.6 years. Of the 3093 participants, 1577 (50.9%) attended the ED during the period of follow-up. Attendees had lower mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations than non-attendees (59.1 vs. 70.6 nmol/L). Fully adjusted models showed an inverse association between vitamin D and ED attendance (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.996; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.995–0.998; p < 0.001). A total of 1269 participants (41%) were admitted to hospital during the follow-up. Those admitted had lower mean vitamin D concentrations (58.4 vs. 69.3 nmol/L, p < 0.001). In fully adjusted models, higher vitamin D was inversely associated with hospital admission (HR 0.996; 95% CI 0.994–0.998; p < 0.001) and length of stay (LOS) (β = −0.95, p = 0.006).

Tachyarrhythmias have been reported but the prevalence of bradyarrhythmia is unclear. Cases have been described of transient high‐degree atrioventricular (AV) block in COVID‐19 that were managed conservatively. METHOD: A database of all patients requiring temporary or permanent pacing in two linked cardiac centers was used to compare the number of procedures required during the first year of the pandemic compared to the corresponding period a year earlier. The database was cross‐referenced with a database of all patients testing positive for Sars‐Cov‐2 infection in both institutions to identify patients who required temporary or permanent pacing during COVID‐19. RESULTS: The number of novel pacemaker implants was lower during the COVID‐19 pandemic than the same period the previous year (540 vs. 629, respectively), with a similar proportion of high‐degree AV block (38.3% vs. 33.2%, respectively, p = .069). Four patients with the Sars‐Cov‐2 infection had a pacemaker implanted for high‐degree AV block, two for sinus node dysfunction. Of this cohort of six patients, two succumbed to the COVID‐19 illness and one from non‐COVID sepsis. Device interrogation demonstrated a sustained pacing requirement in all cases. CONCLUSION: High‐degree AV block remained unaltered in prevalence during the COVID‐19 pandemic. There was no evidence of transient high‐degree AV block in patients with the Sars‐Cov‐2 infection. Our experience suggests that all clinically significant bradyarrhythmia should be treated by pacing according to usual protocols regardless of the COVID status.","Akhtar, Zaki; Leung, Lisa WM; Kontogiannis, Christos; Zuberi, Zia; Bajpai, Abhay; Sharma, Sumeet; Chen, Zhong; Beeton, Ian; Sohal, Manav; Gallagher, Mark M.",Pacing Clin Electrophysiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34240439/; https://doi.org/10.1111/pace.14313,426

Different religions, cultural traditions, rituals, and social beliefs guide how funeral practices take place. Family and friends gather together to support each other in times of grief. However, during the coronavirus pandemic, the way funerals are taking place is affected by the country's rules and region to avoid the spread of infection. The present study explores the media portrayal of public sentiments over funerals. In particular, the present study tried to identify linguistic dimensions associated with lexical components of social processes, affective processes, fear, and disgust. An exhaustive search of newspaper coverage of funeral and related articles was made for a specific corona period. After an initial screening for the details and language used, a total of 46 newspaper articles on funerals were finalized for the analysis. Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software was used to determine the association between linguistic dimensions of function words and words related to social and affective processes, as presented in the newspaper articles. Sentiment Analysis and Cognition Engine (SEANCE) was applied for the analysis of sentiment, social cognition, and social order. Bayesian correlation analysis and regression revealed positive and significant associations between function words and affective processes, between pronouns and social processes, and between negative adjectives and psychological processes of fear and disgust. Also, significant negative associations were found between polarity nouns and psychological processes of fear and disgust and between polarity verbs and psychological processes of fear and disgust. Bayes factor 10 provides strong evidence in favor of the study hypotheses. The media is influenced by the prevailing sentiments in society and reflects their perception of the current social order and beliefs. The findings provide a glimpse into the prevailing sentiment of society through the lens of media coverage.

Pediatric respiratory specimens (1,683) submitted to a diagnostic virology laboratory over a 1-year period (December 2004–November 2005) that were negative for seven respiratory viruses by conventional methods were tested for RNA of four HCoVs using sensitive RT-PCR assays. Coronavirus RNAs were detected in 84 (5.0%) specimens: HCoV-NL63 in 37 specimens, HCoV-OC43 in 34, HCoV-229E in 11, and HCoV-HKU1 in 2. The majority of HCoV infections occurred during winter months, and over 62% were in previously healthy children. Twenty-six (41%) coronavirus positive patients had evidence of a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), 17 (26%) presented with vomiting and/or diarrhea, and 5 (8%) presented with meningoencephalitis or seizures. Respiratory specimens from one immunocompromised patient were persistently positive for HCoV-229E RNA for 3 months. HCoV-NL63-positive patients were nearly twice as likely to be hospitalized (P = 0.02) and to have a LRTI (P = 0.04) than HCoV-OC43-positive patients. HCoVs are associated with a small, but significant number (at least 2.4% of total samples submitted), of both upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses in children in Colorado. Our data raise the possibility that HCoV may play a role in gastrointestinal and CNS disease. Additional studies are needed to investigate the potential roles of HCoVs in these diseases.","Dominguez, Samuel R.; Robinson, Christine C.; Holmes, Kathryn V.",Journal of Medical Virology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.21541; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19626607/; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/jmv.21541,426

The primary roles of the coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein are to interact with the viral genome and pack them into ribonucleoprotein complex. It also plays critical roles at many stages of the viral life cycle. Herein, we explore the N protein of SARS-CoV2 to identify promising epitope-based vaccine candidates and target the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV2 N-protein for potential inhibitors using an integrative bioinformatics approach. We identified B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes that are non-toxic, non-allergenic, capable of inducing IFN-γ and structurally stable with high global population coverage of response. The (404)SKQLQQSMSSADS(416) and (92)RRIRGGDGKMKDL(104) sequences of N-protein were identified to induce B-cell immunity. We also identified (79)SSPDDQIGY(87) and (305)AQFAPSASAFFGMSR(319) as potential T-cell epitopes that form stable structures with human leucocyte antigens. We have also identified zidovudine triphosphate, an anti-HIV agent, as a potential inhibitor of the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV2 N-protein based on docking and simulation analysis and should be considered for experimental validations. The findings of this study can help fast-track the discovery of therapeutic options to combat COVID-19.","Kwarteng, Alexander; Asiedu, Ebenezer; Sakyi, Samuel Amoah; Asiedu, Samuel Opoku",Biomed Pharmacother,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0753332220311069; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332220311069?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110914; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33254432/,426

This paper provides a general overview of the way that the Wuhan local government use Weibo as a channel to engage with their citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the media richness, dialogic loop, and a series of theoretically relevant factors, such as content type, text length, and information source, we try to examine how citizen engage with their local government. By analyzing the data mining samples from Wuhan Release, the official Sina Weibo account of Wuhan’s local government, results show that, despite the unstable situation COVID-19 over the crisis, there exist three stages of a crisis on the whole. Combining the behavior of the government and the public, duration from 31 December 2019 to 19 January 2020 could be seen as the development period, then the outbreak period (30 January 2020 to 28 February 2020), and a grace period (29 February 2020 to19 April 2020). Public attention to different types of information changes over time, but curbing rumors has always been a priority. Media richness features partially influent citizen engagement.

We introduce a simple method to estimate the reproductive number by modifying the method originally proposed by Wallinga and Teunis and using existing information on contact patterns between age groups. We additionally perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the potential impact of differential healthcare seeking patterns by age. We illustrate this method using data from the 2009 H1N1 Influenza pandemic in Gauteng Province, South Africa. RESULTS: Our results are consistent with others in showing decreased transmission with age. We show that results can change markedly when we make the account for differential healthcare seeking behaviors by age. CONCLUSIONS: We show substantial heterogeneity in transmission by age group during the Influenza A H1N1 pandemic in South Africa.

Among them, the prediction model based on mathematical epidemiology (SIR) is the most widely used, but most of these models are adapted in special situations based on various assumptions. In this study, a general adapted time-window based SIR prediction model is proposed, which is characterized by introducing a time window mechanism for dynamic data analysis and using machine learning method predicts the basic reproduction number and the exponential growth rate of the epidemic. We analyzed COVID-19 data from February to July 2020 in seven countries–––China, South Korea, Italy, Spain, Brazil, Germany and France, and the numerical results showed that the framework can effectively measure the real-time changes of the parameters during the epidemic, and error rate of predicting the number of COVID-19 infections in a single day is within 5%.","Liao, Zhifang; Lan, Peng; Liao, Zhining; Zhang, Yan; Liu, Shengzong",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33384444/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-80007-8,426

This infectious disease has become a major public health challenge in the world. Unfortunately, to date, no specific antivirals have been proven to be effective against COVID-19, and although a few vaccines are available, the mortality rate is not decreasing but is still increasing. One therapeutic strategy has been focused on infection prevention and control measures. In this regard, the use of nutraceutical supports may play a role against some aspect of the infection, particularly the inflammatory state and the immune system function of patients, thus representing a strategy to control the worst outcomes of this pandemic. For this reason, we performed an overview including meta-analyses and systematic reviews to assess the association among melatonin, vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc supplementation and inflammatory markers using three databases, namely, MEDLINE, PubMed Central and the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews. According to the evidence available, an intake of 50,000 IU/month of vitamin D showed efficacy in CRP. An amount of 1 to 2 g per day of vitamin C demonstrated efficacy both in CRP and endothelial function, and a dosage of melatonin ranging from 5 to 25 mg /day showed good evidence of efficacy in CRP, TNF and IL6. A dose of 50 mg/day of elemental zinc supplementation showed positive results in CRP. Based on the data reported in this review, the public health system could consider whether it is possible to supplement the current limited preventive measures through targeted nutraceutical large-scale administration.","Corrao, Salvatore; Mallaci Bocchio, Raffaella; Lo Monaco, Marika; Natoli, Giuseppe; Cavezzi, Attilio; Troiani, Emidio; Argano, Christiano",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13041261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33921297/,426

The presence of symptoms of GAD was defined by a GAD-7 score of 10 or more points. Voluntary and anonymous participation, acceptance of terms, and informed consent were requested. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Symptoms of GAD were identified in 4 out of 10 Colombian general practitioners; the following psychosocial and demographic factors were associated with a greater presence of these symptoms: female gender, social discrimination, anguish, job disappointment, nightmares, stress and other symptoms of fear regarding the pandemic. Conversely, feeling protected by the state or employer, being satisfied with their job as a physician, and trusting government measures and information were associated with a lower presence of symptoms of GAD. These findings highlight the importance of timely psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological interventions in these individuals.

Yet, individuals may not be affected equally by stressors posed by the pandemic and those with pre-existing mental disorders could be particularly vulnerable. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the psychological response to the pandemic in a case–control design. We used an age-, sex- and employment status-matched case–control sample (n = 216) of psychiatric inpatients, recruited from the LMU Psychiatry Biobank Munich study and non-clinical individuals from the general population. Participants completed validated self-report measures on stress, anxiety, depression, paranoia, rumination, loneliness, well-being, resilience, and a newly developed index of stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to assess the effects of group, COVID-19-specific stressors, and their interaction on the different psychosocial outcomes. While psychiatric inpatients reported larger mental health difficulties overall, the impact of COVID-19-specific stressors was lower in patients and not associated with worse psychological functioning compared to non-clinical individuals. In contrast, depressive symptoms, rumination, loneliness, and well-being were more strongly associated with COVID-19-specific stressors in non-clinical individuals and similar to the severity of inpatients for those who experienced the greatest COVID-19-specific stressor impact Contrary to expectations, the psychological response to the pandemic may not be worse in psychiatric inpatients compared to non-clinical individuals.

The identification and designing of appropriate and reliable drug molecule for the treatment of COVID-19 patients is the pressing need of the present time. Among different drug targets, the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 is being considered as most effective target. In addition to the drug repurposing, different compounds of natural as well as synthetic origins are being investigated for their efficacy against different drug targets of SARS-CoV-2 virus. In that context, the chromone based natural flavonols have also exhibited significant antiviral properties against different targets of SARS-CoV-2. The in silico studies presented here discloses the efficacy of triarylchromones (TAC) as potential inhibitor against main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The molecular docking and ADMET study performed using 14 arylchromones which could easily be accessed through simple synthetic protocols, revealed best binding affinities in case of TAC-3 (–11.2 kcal/mol), TAC-4 (–10.5 kcal/mol), TAC-6 (–11.2 kcal/mol), TAC-7 (–10.0 kcal/mol).

There is no specific therapeutics to encounter the COVID-19. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based therapy is an efficient strategy to control human viral infections employing post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) through neutralizing target complementary mRNA. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) encoded by the viral RdRp gene as a part of the replication-transcription complex can be adopted as an acceptable target for controlling SARS-CoV-2 mediated infection. Therefore, in the current study, accessible siRNA designing tools, including significant algorithms and parameters, were rationally used to design the candidate siRNAs against SARS-COV-2 encoded RdRp. The designed siRNA molecules possessed adequate nucleotide-based and other features for potent gene silencing. The targets of the designed siRNAs revealed no significant matches within the whole human genome, ruling out any possibilities for off-target silencing by the siRNAs. Characterization with different potential parameters of efficacy allowed selecting the finest siRNA among all the designed siRNA molecules. Further, validation assessment and target site accessibility prediction also rationalized the suitability of this siRNA molecule. Molecular docking study between the selected siRNA molecule and component of RNA interference (RNAi) pathway gave an excellent outcome. Molecular dynamics of two complexes: siRNA and argonaute complex, guide RNA, and target protein complex, have shown structural stability of these proteins. Therefore, the designed siRNA molecule might act as an effective therapeutic agent against the SARS-CoV-2 at the genome level and can prevent further outbreaks of COVID-19 in humans.","Shawan, Mohammad Mahfuz Ali Khan; Sharma, Ashish Ranjan; Bhattacharya, Manojit; Mallik, Bidyut; Akhter, Farhana; Shakil, Md.

605175,Preparedness and Preventive Behaviors for a Pandemic Disaster Caused by COVID-19 in Serbia,2020-06-09,"Coronavirus M proteins represent the major protein component of the viral envelope. They play an essential role during viral assembly by interacting with all of the other structural proteins. Coronaviruses bud into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), but the mechanisms by which M proteins are transported from their site of synthesis, the ER, to the budding site remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the intracellular trafficking of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) M protein. Subcellular localization analyses revealed that the MERS-CoV M protein is retained intracellularly in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and we identified two motifs in the distal part of the C-terminal domain as being important for this specific localization. We identified the first motif as a functional diacidic DxE ER export signal, because substituting Asp-211 and Glu-213 with alanine induced retention of the MERS-CoV M in the ER. The second motif, (199)KxGxYR(204), was responsible for retaining the M protein in the TGN. Substitution of this motif resulted in MERS-CoV M leakage toward the plasma membrane. We further confirmed the role of (199)KxGxYR(204) as a TGN retention signal by using chimeras between MERS-CoV M and the M protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Our results indicated that the C-terminal domains of both proteins determine their specific localization, namely TGN and ERGIC/cis-Golgi for MERS-M and IBV-M, respectively. Our findings indicate that MERS-CoV M protein localizes to the TGN because of the combined presence of an ER export signal and a TGN retention motif.","Perrier, Anabelle; Bonnin, Ariane; Desmarets, Lowiese; Danneels, Adeline; Goffard, Anne; Rouillé, Yves; Dubuisson, Jean; Belouzard, Sandrine",Journal of Biological Chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399512/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002192582034998X; http://www.jbc.org/content/294/39/14406.full.pdf; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002192582034998X; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra119.008964,426

Conventional treatments against influenza include two classes of pathogen-targeting antivirals: M2 ion channel blockers (such as amantadine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (such as oseltamivir). Examination of the mechanism of influenza viral infection has shown that endosomal acidification plays a major role in facilitating the fusion between viral and endosomal membranes. This pathway has led to investigations on vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) activity, whose role as a regulating factor on influenza virus replication has been verified in extensive genome-wide screenings. Blocking v-ATPase activity thus presents the opportunity to interfere with influenza viral infection by preventing the pH-dependent membrane fusion between endosomes and virions. This study aims to apply diphyllin, a natural compound shown to be as a novel v-ATPase inhibitor, as a potential antiviral for various influenza virus strains using cell-based assays. The results show that diphyllin alters cellular susceptibility to influenza viruses through the inhibition of endosomal acidification, thus interfering with downstream virus replication, including that of known drug-resistant strains. In addition, combinatorial treatment of the host-targeting diphyllin with pathogen-targeting therapeutics (oseltamivir and amantadine) demonstrates enhanced antiviral effects and cell protection in vitro.","Chen, Hui-Wen; Cheng, Jenna Xiao; Liu, Ming-Tsan; King, Kevin; Peng, Ju-Yi; Zhang, Xin-Quan; Wang, Ching-Ho; Shresta, Sujan; Schooley, Robert T.; Liu, Yu-Tsueng",Antiviral Research,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016635421300171X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016635421300171X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.06.014; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3787953?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23820269/,426

We execute a comprehensive in silico analysis of viral peptide-MHC class I binding affinity across all known HLA -A, -B, and -C genotypes for all SARS-CoV-2 peptides. We further explore the potential for cross-protective immunity conferred by prior exposure to four common human coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome is successfully sampled and presented by a diversity of HLA alleles. However, we found that HLA-B*46:01 had the fewest predicted binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting individuals with this allele may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, as they were previously shown to be for SARS (1). Conversely, we found that HLA-B*15:03 showed the greatest capacity to present highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are shared among common human coronaviruses, suggesting it could enable cross-protective T-cell based immunity. Finally, we report global distributions of HLA types with potential epidemiological ramifications in the setting of the current pandemic.","Nguyen, Austin; David, Julianne K; Maden, Sean K; Wood, Mary A; Weeder, Benjamin R; Nellore, Abhinav; Thompson, Reid F",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040600,426

As such, it has a possible protective role against the risk of respiratory tract infections and other diseases. It may be useful in particular, during COVID-19 pandemic. PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE were searched from inception until January 31, 2021, for observational or clinical studies reporting the prognosis (and therapeutic effect) of COVID-19 infection in patients with deficient vitamin D levels. The infection rate, severity, and death from COVID-19 infection were pooled to provide an odds ratio with a 95 % confidence interval (OR 95 % CI). An OR > 1 was associated with the worst outcome in deficient compared with nondeficient patients. We assessed the association between vitamin D and risk, severity, and mortality for COVID-19 infection, through a review of 43 observational studies. Among subjects with deficient vitamin D values, risk of COVID-19 infection was higher compared to those with replete values (OR = 1.26; 95 % CI, 1.19–1.34; P < .01). Vitamin D deficiency was also associated with worse severity and higher mortality than in nondeficient patients (OR = 2.6; 95 % CI, 1.84–3.67; P < .01 and OR = 1.22; 95 % CI, 1.04–1.43; P < .01, respectively).

Widely reported U.S. excess death estimates have not accounted for recent population changes, especially increases in the population older than 65 years. OBJECTIVE: To estimate excess deaths in the United States in 2020, after accounting for population changes. DESIGN: Surveillance study. SETTING: United States, March to August 2020. PARTICIPANTS: All decedents. MEASUREMENTS: Age-specific excess deaths in the United States from 1 March to 31 August 2020 compared with 2015 to 2019 were estimated, after changes in population size and age were taken into account, by using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provisional death data and U.S. Census Bureau population estimates. Cause-specific excess deaths were estimated by month and age. RESULTS: From March through August 2020, 1 671 400 deaths were registered in the United States, including 173 300 COVID-19 deaths. An average of 1 370 000 deaths were reported over the same months during 2015 to 2019, for a crude excess of 301 400 deaths (128 100 non–COVID-19 deaths). However, the 2020 U.S. population includes 5.04 million more persons aged 65 years and older than the average population in 2015 to 2019 (a 10% increase). After population changes were taken into account, an estimated 217 900 excess deaths occurred from March through August 2020 (173 300 COVID-19 and 44 600 non–COVID-19 deaths). Most excess non–COVID-19 deaths occurred in April, July, and August, and 34 900 (78%) were in persons aged 25 to 64 years. Diabetes, Alzheimer disease, and heart disease caused the most non–COVID-19 excess deaths. LIMITATION: Provisional death data are underestimated because of reporting delays. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an estimated 218 000 excess deaths in the United States between March and August 2020, and 80% of those deaths had COVID-19 as the underlying cause. Accounting for population changes substantially reduced the excess non–COVID-19 death estimates, providing important information for guiding future clinical and public health interventions.

608610,To Vaccinate or Not to Vaccinate—This Is the Question among Swiss University Students,2021-08-31,"The interferon response is a potent antiviral defense mechanism, but its effectiveness depends on its timing relative to viral replication. Here, we report viral replication and host response kinetics in patients at the start of SARS-CoV-2 infection and explore the impact of these kinetics experimentally. In both longitudinal patient nasopharyngeal samples and airway epithelial organoids, we found that SARS-CoV-2 initially replicated exponentially with a doubling time of ~6hr, and induced interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) with delayed timing relative to viral replication. Prior exposure to rhinovirus increased ISG levels and blocked SARS-CoV-2 replication. Conversely, inhibiting ISG induction abrogated interference by rhinovirus and enhanced SARS-CoV-2 replication rate. These results demonstrate the importance of initial interferon-mediated defenses in determining the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 can replicate at the start of infection and indicate that biological variables that alter the airway interferon response, including heterologous induction of innate immunity by other viruses, could profoundly impact SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and transmission.","Cheemarla, Nagarjuna R.; Watkins, Timothy A.; Mihaylova, Valia T.; Wang, Bao; Zhao, Dejian; Wang, Guilin; Landry, Marie L.; Foxman, Ellen F.",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.22.21249812; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33532783/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21249812v1?rss=1,426

At our institution, we had the unique opportunity to conduct an in-person interview (IPI) prior to the pandemic-related travel restrictions, and a VI after the restrictions were in place. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to understand how the VI model compares with the traditional IPI approach. METHODS: Online surveys were distributed to both groups, collecting feedback on their interview experience. Responses were evaluated using a two-sample t test assuming equal variances. RESULTS: Twenty-three of 26 (88%) applicants completed the survey. Most applicants reported that the interview gave them a satisfactory understanding of the CGSO fellowship (100% IPI, 92% VI) and the majority in both groups felt that the interview experience allowed them to accurately represent themselves (92% and 82%, respectively). All participants in the IPI group felt they were able to get an adequate understanding of the culture of the program, while only 64% in the VI group agreed with that statement (p = 0.02). IPI applicants were more likely to agree that the interview experience was sufficient to allow them to make a ranking decision (92% vs. 54%; p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: While the VI modality offers several advantages over the IPI, it still falls short in conveying some of the more subjective aspects of the programs, including program culture. Strategies to provide applicants with better insight into these areas during the VI will be important moving forward.","Grova, Monica M.; Donohue, Sean J.; Meyers, Michael O.; Kim, Hong Jin; Ollila, David W.",Ann Surg Oncol,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-09398-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33244739/,426

To facilitate the identification of new distantly related members of the family Coronaviridae, we have developed a molecular assay with broad specificity. The consensus-degenerated hybrid oligonucleotide primer (CODEHOP) strategy was modified to design primers targeting the most conserved motifs in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase locus. They were evaluated initially on RNA templates from virus-infected cells using a two-step RT-PCR protocol that was further advanced to a one-step assay. The sensitivity of the assay ranged from 10(2) to 10(6) and from 10(5) to 10(9) RNA copy numbers for individual corona-/torovirus templates when tested, respectively, with and without an excess of RNA from human cells. This primer set compared to that designed according to the original CODEHOP rules showed 10–10(3) folds greater sensitivity for 5 of the 6 evaluated corona-/torovirus templates. It detected 57% (32 of 56) of the respiratory specimens positive for 4 human coronaviruses, as well as stool specimens positive for a bovine torovirus. The high sensitivity and broad virus range of this assay makes it suitable for screening biological specimens in search for new viruses of the family Coronaviridae.","Zlateva, Kalina T.; Crusio, Kelly M.; Leontovich, Andrey M.; Lauber, Chris; Claas, Eric; Kravchenko, Alexander A.; Spaan, Willy J.M.; Gorbalenya, Alexander E.",J Virol Methods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21864579/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093411003235; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093411003235; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.08.005,426

DESIGN: In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, 74 patients with NAFLD were administered either 2 g P. major or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. All patients were advised to follow the recommendations for daily exercise and diet modification. Levels of liver enzymes as well as other laboratory indexes were measured at the beginning of the study and after 12 weeks. Indeed, the alteration in ultrasound grade was evaluated in NAFLD patients.

610833,Reflection of Challenges and Opportunities within the COVID-19 Pandemic to Include Biological Hazards into DRR Planning,2021-02-08,"Many chronic conditions such as cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type-2 diabetes, obesity, peripheral/coronary artery disease and auto-immune diseases are associated with low-grade inflammation. Closely related to inflammation is oxidative stress (OS), which can be either causal or secondary to inflammation. While a low level of OS is physiological, chronically increased OS is deleterious. Therefore, valid biomarkers of these signalling pathways may enable detection and following progression of OS/inflammation as well as to evaluate treatment efficacy. Such biomarkers should be stable and obtainable through non-invasive methods and their determination should be affordable and easy. The most frequently used inflammatory markers include acute-phase proteins, essentially CRP, serum amyloid A, fibrinogen and procalcitonin, and cytokines, predominantly TNFα, interleukins 1β, 6, 8, 10 and 12 and their receptors and IFNγ. Some cytokines appear to be disease-specific. Conversely, OS—being ubiquitous—and its biomarkers appear less disease or tissue-specific. These include lipid peroxidation products, e.g., F2-isoprostanes and malondialdehyde, DNA breakdown products (e.g., 8-OH-dG), protein adducts (e.g., carbonylated proteins), or antioxidant status. More novel markers include also –omics related ones, as well as non-invasive, questionnaire-based measures, such as the dietary inflammatory-index (DII), but their link to biological responses may be variable. Nevertheless, many of these markers have been clearly related to a number of diseases. However, their use in clinical practice is often limited, due to lacking analytical or clinical validation, or technical challenges. In this review, we strive to highlight frequently employed and useful markers of inflammation-related OS, including novel promising markers.","Menzel, Alain; Samouda, Hanen; Dohet, Francois; Loap, Suva; Ellulu, Mohammed S.; Bohn, Torsten",Antioxidants (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33803155/; https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox10030414,426

The vast majority of the countries worldwide being hit by the pandemic have shown the frailty of their health and social care systems. Although the surprise factor could somehow justify the unpreparedness experienced during the first wave, the second wave still led to significant difficulties almost everywhere. Looking at Italy's situation, it is evident how the stress test applied by COVID-19 on the system has threatened its stability, getting it closer to collapsing many times. It is true that Italy, in particular the Northern regions, has been the epicenter of COVID-19 in Europe in a time when information about the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was still lacking and confusing. Nevertheless, what happened has demonstrated significant issues in the structure, priorities, and organization of the system. It has exemplified the obsolete approach adopted in clinical practice, particularly when applied to frail older persons. The COVID-19 pandemic has made emerging the need for a substantial reshaping of our healthcare system. The hospital-centered model has dramatically failed. To adequately face the new challenges brought by the increasing complexity of our aging society, it is critical to move the barycenter of action toward the community/primary care, promoting the integration of services and centralization of clinical/administrative data.

The biochar exhibits high higher heating value (HHV) (33.22-33.75 MJ/kg) and low ash content (2.34%), which is obviously superior to that of the walnut shell and anthracite coal. The bio-oil contains rich aromatic components, such as 1,2-dimethylbenzene and 2-methylnaphthalene, which can be used as chemical feedstock for insecticides. Furthermore, the 3DGF800 has a wide range of applications in the fields of oil spill cleanup and oil/water separation according to its fire resistance, high absorbability (40-89 g g-1) and long-term cycling stability.

DESIGN & SETTING: A cross-sectional self-administered survey of adult patients in general practices across the West Midlands, UK. METHOD: Descriptive statistics were used to show participants’ awareness of and interaction with online information sources and remote access. Multivariable logistic regression was used to model the relationships between demographic and health characteristics, and awareness and use of online services and alternatives to face-to-face consultations (for example, telephone). RESULTS: A total of 2789 patients (19.0% response rate) from 43 general practices participated.

This review discusses the underlying mechanisms linking COVID-19 to liver dysfunction, according to recent available information, while waiting further studies. The manifestations of liver damage are usually mild (moderately elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase activities), and generally asymptomatic. Few patients can still develop severe liver problems, and therapeutic options can be limited. Liver dysfunction may affect about one-third of the patients, with prevalence greater in men than women, and in elderly. Mechanisms of damage are complex and include direct cholangiocyte damage and other coexisting conditions such as the use of antiviral drugs, systemic inflammatory response, respiratory distress syndrome-induced hypoxia, sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction. During new COVID-19 infections, liver injury may be observed. If liver involvement appears during COVID-19 infection, however, attention is required. This is particularly true if patients are older or have a pre-existing history of liver diseases. During COVID-19 infection, the onset of liver damage impairs the prognosis, and hospital stay is longer.","Portincasa, Piero; Krawczyk, Marcin; Machill, Antonia; Lammert, Frank; Ciaula, Agostino Di",Eur J Intern Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0953620520302284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32507608/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0953620520302284?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2020.05.035,426
614037,COVID-19 Impact on SDGs and the Fiscal Measures: Case of Indonesia,2021-03-12,"Background The current prevailing position is that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is transmitted primarily through large respiratory droplets within close proximity (i.e., 1-2 m) of infected individuals. However, quantitative information on the relative importance of specific transmission pathways of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (i.e., droplets, aerosols, and fomites across short- and long-range distances) remains limited. Methods To evaluate the relative importance of multiple transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2, we leveraged detailed information available from the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship outbreak that occurred in early 2020. We developed a framework that combines stochastic Markov chain and negative exponential dose-response modeling with available empirical data on mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and human behaviors, which informs a modified version of the Reed-Frost epidemic model to predict daily and cumulative daily case counts on the ship. We modeled 21,600 scenarios to generate a matrix of solutions across a full range of assumptions for eight unknown or uncertain epidemic and mechanistic transmission factors, including the magnitude of droplet and aerosol emissions from infected individuals, the infectious dose for deposition of droplets and aerosols to the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and others. Findings A total of 132 model iterations met acceptability criteria (R2 > 0.95 for modeled vs. reported cumulative daily cases and R2 > 0 for daily cases). Analyzing only these successful model iterations yields insights into the likely values for uncertain parameters and quantifies the likely contributions of each defined mode of transmission. Mean estimates of the contributions of short-range, long-range, and fomite transmission modes to infected cases aboard the ship across the entire simulation time period were 35%, 35%, and 30%, respectively. Mean estimates of the contributions of large respiratory droplets and small respiratory aerosols were 41% and 59%. Short-range transmission was the dominant mode after passenger quarantine began, albeit due primarily to aerosol transmission, not droplets. Interpretation Our results demonstrate that aerosol inhalation was likely the dominant contributor to COVID-19 transmission among passengers aboard the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship. Moreover, close-range and long-range transmission likely contributed similarly to disease progression aboard the ship, with fomite transmission playing a smaller role. The passenger quarantine also affected the importance of each mode, demonstrating the impacts of the interventions. Although cruise ships represent unique built environments with high ventilation rates and no air recirculation, these findings underscore the importance of implementing public health measures that target the control of inhalation of aerosols in addition to ongoing measures targeting control of large droplet and fomite transmission, not only aboard cruise ships but in other indoor environments as well.","Azimi, P.; Keshavarz, Z.; Cedeno Laurent, J.

Although therapeutic antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike currently focus on the poorly conserved receptor-binding domain, targeting essential neutralizing epitopes on the more conserved S2 domain may provide broader protection. We report an antibody binding an epitope conserved in the pre-fusion core of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike S2 domains. Antibody 3A3 binds a conformational epitope with ~2.5 nM affinity and neutralizes spike from SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern in in vitro pseudovirus assays. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry identified residues 980-1006 in the flexible hinge region at the S2 apex as the 3A3 epitope, suggesting 3A3 prevents the S2 conformational rearrangements required for conversion to the spike post-fusion state and virus-host cell fusion.

The Office of National Statistics in the UK predicts that the fastest growing age group in coming decades will be those over 85 years. This is reflected in Trauma Audit and Research Network data, which has highlighted a shift in caseload from a majority of young males to elderly patients at UK Major Trauma Centres (MTC). This study of elderly trauma patients admitted to a UK MTC reviews the links between frailty, using the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), and outcomes from trauma. METHODS: A retrospective database review of patients > 65 years old admitted to our MTC was performed. We identified 1125 eligible patients of which 729 had a recorded CFS. Those without a CFS were omitted. The primary outcome measured was in-hospital mortality. Secondary measures were Injury Severity Score, length of stay, trauma team activation on arrival and discharge destination. Multivariate regression analyses were performed using STATA v 15. RESULTS: Those of CFS 5–9 (frail) were 2.6 times more likely to die than the CFS 1–4 (pre-frail) (OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.47–4.78). The frail group was also 56% less likely to have a trauma call on admission (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.30–0.65) and 61% less likely to be discharged to their usual place of residence (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.28–0.55). CONCLUSION: We advocate the use of the Clinical Frailty Scale as a screening tool for frailty in trauma patients, highlighting those at risk of increased length of stay and mortality, subsequently assisting healthcare providers with setting realistic expectations with family members.

Recent studies reported that during such traumatic events, women tend to be at greater risk than men for developing symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. Several studies reported that a mindfulness-based stress reduction protocol (MBSR) provides useful skills for dealing with traumatic events. In our study, a sample of Italian females received an 8-week MBSR course plus 6 weeks of video support for meditation practice during the first total lockdown in Italy. We assessed the participants with questionnaires before and after this period to investigate their mindfulness skills, psychological well-being, post-traumatic growth, and psychological flexibility. After the intervention, the meditators group reported improvement in measures associated with self-acceptance, purpose in life, and relation to others compared to the control group. Furthermore, our results showed that participants with greater mindfulness scores showed high levels of psychological flexibility, which in turn was positively associated with higher levels of psychological well-being. We concluded that the MBSR could support psychological well-being, at least in female subjects, even during an unpredictable adverse event, such as the COVID-19 lockdown, by reinforcing key psychological aspects.","Accoto, Alessandra; Chiarella, Salvatore Gaetano; Raffone, Antonino; Montano, Antonella; de Marco, Adriano; Mainiero, Francesco; Rubbino, Roberta; Valzania, Alessandro; Conversi, David",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18115512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34063864/,426

To date, millions of infections and thousands of deaths have been reported worldwide, and the numbers continue to rise. Currently, there is no specific drug or vaccine against this deadly virus; therefore, there is a pressing need to understand the mechanism(s) through which this virus enters the host cell. Viral entry into the host cell is a multistep process in which SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) glycoprotein to recognize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the human cells; this initiates host-cell entry by promoting viral–host cell membrane fusion through large-scale conformational changes in the S protein. Receptor recognition and fusion are critical and essential steps of viral infections and are key determinants of the viral host range and cross-species transmission. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the roles of key viral factors. We discuss the structure of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 and its significance in drug discovery and explain the receptor recognition mechanisms of coronaviruses. Further, we provide a comparative analysis of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins and their receptor-binding specificity and discuss the differences in their antigenicity based on biophysical and structural characteristics.","Mittal, Anshumali; Manjunath, Kavyashree; Ranjan, Rajesh Kumar; Kaushik, Sandeep; Kumar, Sujeet; Verma, Vikash",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32822426/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008762,426

METHODS: Public Health England conducts invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in England. IPD trends during 2000/01-2019/20 were analysed and cases between during February-June 2020 were linked with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess risk factors for death. RESULTS: IPD incidence in 2019/20 (7.6/100,000; n=3,964) was 30% (IRR 0.70, 95%CI, 0.18-2.67) lower compared to 2018/19 (10.9/100,000; n=5,666) with large reductions observed across all age-groups during March-June 2020. The serotypes responsible for IPD during 2019/20 were similar to previous years. There were 160,886 SARS-CoV-2 and 1,137 IPD cases during February-June 2020, including 40 IPD/COVID-19 (0.025% [95%sCI, 0.018-0.034] of SARS-CoV-2 infections; 3.5% [95%CI, 2.5-4.8] of IPD cases), 21 with COVID-19 diagnosed 3-27 days after IPD and 27 who developed COVID-19 ≥28 days after IPD. Case-fatality rates (CFR) were 63.2% (25/40), 47.6% (10/21) and 33.3% (9/27), respectively (p<0.001). In addition to an independent association with increasing age and pneumococcal serotype group, CFR was 7.8-fold (95% CI, 3.8-15.8) higher in those with IPD/COVID-19 co-infection and 3.9-fold (95% CI, 1.4-10.7) higher in patients who developed COVID-19 3-27 days after IPD compared to patients with IPD only. CONCLUSIONS: Large declines in IPD were observed following COVID-19 lockdown in England. IPD/COVID-19 confections were rare but associated with high CFR, mainly in older adults. The rarity, age distribution and serotype distribution of IPD/SARS-CoV-2 coinfections does not support wider extension of pneumococcal vaccination.","Amin-Chowdhury, Zahin; Aiano, Felicity; Mensah, Anna; Sheppard, Carmen; Litt, David; Fry, Norman K; Andrews, Nick; Ramsay, Mary E; Ladhani, Shamez N",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33196783/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1728,426

This study concentrated on the first 30 min of infection. It was discovered that the SARS coronavirus attached, entered, and uncoated the nucleocapsids, all within a 30‐min period. At 5 min after infection, several virus particles lined the Vero cell plasma membrane. Virus particles were at various stages of fusion at the cell surface, since entry was not a synchronised process. After entry (10 and 15 min), spherical core particles moved into the cytoplasm within large vacuoles. Quite surprising at such early stages of infection (20 min), a virus‐induced change in the infected cells was evident. The induction of myelin‐like membrane whorls was obvious within the same vacuoles as the core particles. The significance of this virus‐induced change is unknown at this stage. By 25–30 min postinfection (p.i.), the spherical core particles appeared to be disassociating and, in their place, doughnut‐shaped electron‐dense structures were observed. These could be the virus genomes together with the helical nucleocapsids. They were no longer in large vacuoles but packaged into smaller vacuoles in the cytoplasm, and occasionally in small groups.

A microarray system is described for an unbiased detection of plant viruses using both short (30 nt) and long (50 and 70 nt) oligonucleotide probes. The assay involves amplification of target nucleic acid using random primers followed by in vitro transcription whose cRNA product is labeled chemically, fragmented and used as target for hybridization. Initial optimization tests with Turnip vein clearing virus and Cauliflower mosaic virus showed increased hybridization efficiency with shorter cDNA targets (100 bp) and longer probes (50 and 70 nt). The system was validated in pure and mixed samples by detection of three Tymovirus species: Asclepias asymptomatic virus, Kennedya yellow mosaic virus and Turnip yellow mosaic virus. The method could detect sequence variants with 70–75% or higher sequence identity, indicating the possible utility of the approach for virus discovery.

Almost all hospital departments have had to profoundly modify their activity to cope with the crisis. In this context, the surgical management of cancers has been a topic of debate as care strategies were tailored to avoid any delay in treatment that could be detrimental to patient wellbeing while being careful not to overload intensive care units. The primary objective of this study was to observe changes in the surgical management of pelvic cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic in France. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study analyzed data from the prospective multi-center cohort study conducted by the French Society for Pelvic and Gynecological Surgery (SCGP) with methodological support from the French (FRANCOGYN) Group. All members of the SCGP received by e-mail a link allowing them to include patients who were scheduled to undergo gynecological carcinologic surgery between March 16th 2020 and May 11th 2020. Demographic data, the characteristics of cancers and the impact of the crisis in terms of changes to the usual recommended coarse of care were collected. RESULTS: A total of 181 patients with a median age 63 years were included in the cohort. In total, 31 patients had cervical cancer, 76 patients had endometrial cancer, 52 patients had ovarian or tubal cancer, 5 patients had a borderline tumor of the ovary, and 17 patients had vulvar cancer. During the study period, the care strategy was changed for 49 (27%) patients with postponed for 35 (19.3%) patients, and canceled for 7 (3.9%) patients. Surgical treatment was maintained for 139 (76.8%) patients. Management with neoadjuvant chemotherapy was offered to 19 (10,5%) patients and a change in surgical choice was made for 5 (2,8%) patients. In total, 8 (4,4%) patients tested positive for COVID-19. Data also shows a greater number of therapeutic changes in cases of ovarian cancer as well as a cancelation of a lumbo-aortic lymphadenectomy in one patient with cervical cancer. Hospital consultants estimated a direct detrimental impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for 39 patients, representing 22% of gynecological cancers.

622234,Evaluating Effectiveness of YouTube Videos for Teaching Medical Students CPR: Solution to Optimizing Clinician Educator Workload during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-07-02,"Abstract Rationale and Objectives Social distancing mandates due to COVID-19 have necessitated adaptations to radiology trainee workflow and educational practices, including the radiology ‘readout’. We describe how a large academic radiology department achieved socially distant ‘remote readouts’, provide trainee and attending perspectives on this early experience, and propose ways by which ‘remote readouts’ can be used effectively by training programs beyond COVID-19. Materials and Methods Beginning March 2020, radiologists were relocated to workspaces outside of conventional reading rooms. Information technologies were employed to allow for ‘remote readouts’ between trainees and attendings. An optional anonymous open-ended survey regarding remote readouts was administered to radiology trainees and attendings as a quality improvement initiative. From the responses, response themes were abstracted using thematic analysis. Descriptive statistics of the qualitative data were calculated. Results Radiologist workstations from 14 traditional reading rooms were relocated to 36 workspaces across the hospital system. Two models of remote readouts, synchronous and asynchronous, were developed, facilitated by commercially-available information technologies. 39/105 (37%) trainees and 42/90 (47%) attendings responded to the survey. Main response themes included: social distancing, technology, autonomy/competency, efficiency, education/feedback and atmosphere/professional relationship. 148 positive versus 97 negative comments were reported. Social distancing, technology and autonomy/competency were most positively rated. Trainees and attending perspectives differed regarding the efficiency of remote readouts. Conclusions ‘Remote readouts’, compliant with social distancing measures, are feasible in academic radiology practice settings. Perspectives from our initial experience provide insight into how this can be accomplished, opportunities for improvement and future application, beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Matalon, Shanna A.; Souza, Daniel A.T.; Gaviola, Glenn C.; Silverman, Stuart G.; Mayo-Smith, William W.; Lee, Leslie K.",Acad Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32507612/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1076633220302956?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2020.05.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1076633220302956,426

A Socioeconomic Study on the Potential Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccine in Japan,2021-05-02,"Timely detection and diagnosis are urgently needed to guide epidemiological measures, infection control, antiviral treatment, and vaccine research. In this review, biomarkers/indicators for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the environment are summarized and discussed. It is concluded that the detection methods targeting antibodies are not suitable for screening of early and asymptomatic cases since most patients had an antibody response at about 10 days after onset of symptoms. However, antibody detection methods can be combined with quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to significantly improve the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis, and boost vaccine research. Fast, sensitive and accurate detection methods targeting antigens need to be developed urgently. Various specimens for diagnosis or detection are compared and analyzed. Among them, deep throat saliva and induced sputum are desired for RT-qPCR test or other early detection technologies. Chest computerized tomography (CT) scan, RT-qPCR, lateral flow immunochromatographic strip (LFICS) for diagnosis of COVID-19 are summarized and compared. Specially, potential electrochemical biosensor, surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based biosensor, and artificial intelligence (AI) assisted diagnosis of COVID-19 are emphasized.

622975,Exploring an Efficient Remote Biomedical Signal Monitoring Framework for Personal Health in the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-08-27,"IMPORTANCE: Racial and ethnic disparities plague the US health care system despite efforts to eliminate them. To understand what has been achieved amid these efforts, a comprehensive study from the population perspective is needed. OBJECTIVES: To determine trends in rates and racial/ethnic disparities of key access to care measures among adults in the US in the last two decades. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Data from the National Health Interview Survey, 1999–2018. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals >18 years old. EXPOSURE: Race and ethnicity: non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic Asian, non-Hispanic White, Hispanic. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Rates of lack of insurance coverage, lack of a usual source of care, and foregone/delayed medical care due to cost. We also estimated the gap between non-Hispanic White and the other subgroups for these outcomes. RESULTS: We included 596,355 adults, of which 69.7% identified as White, 11.8% as Black, 4.7% as Asian, and 13.8% as Hispanic. The proportion uninsured and the rates of lacking a usual source of care remained stable across all 4 race/ethnicity subgroups up to 2009, while rates of foregone/delayed medical care due to cost increased. Between 2010 and 2015, the percentage of uninsured diminished for all, with the steepest reduction among Hispanics (−2.1% per year). In the same period, rates of no usual source of care declined only among Hispanics (−1.2% per year) while rates of foregone/delayed medical care due to cost decreased for all. No substantial changes were observed from 2016–2018 in any outcome across subgroups. Compared with 1999, in 2018 the rates of foregone/delayed medical care due to cost were higher for all (+3.1% among Whites, +3.1% among Blacks, +0.5% among Asians, and +2.2% among Hispanics) without significant change in gaps; rates of no usual source of care were not significantly different among Whites or Blacks but were lower among Hispanics (−4.9%) and Asians (−6.4%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Insurance coverage increased for all, but millions of individuals remained uninsured or underinsured with increasing rates of unmet medical needs due to cost. Those identifying as non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic continue to experience more barriers to health care services compared with non-Hispanic White individuals.","Caraballo, César; Massey, Dorothy; Mahajan, Shiwani; Lu, Yuan; Annapureddy, Amarnath R.; Roy, Brita; Riley, Carley; Murugiah, Karthik; Valero-Elizondo, Javier; Onuma, Oyere; Nunez-Smith, Marcella; Forman, Howard P.; Nasir, Khurram; Herrin, Jeph; Krumholz, Harlan M.",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.30.20223420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33173905/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.30.20223420v1?rss=1,426

Rolling data indicate that 257,3605 people are infected by the disease, from which 701,838 have recovered and 178,562 have died. No specific medicine or vaccine is available yet to control the disease, hence, social distancing via lockdown is widely adopted as the only preventive measure. Social distancing is observed at different level of strictness in different counties but it almost made the world to stands still. Although scientific articles on this largest social move are scanty, it resulted in benefiting the deteriorated environment to revive back. Many environmental indices such as lowering NO2 and CO2 emissions and reduction in particulate matters in air as a result of less human activities have led to clean air and pollution free water in many countries. Undoubtedly, the world was experiencing pollution in several countries due to mainly human activities including urbanization, industrialization, fossil fuel exhaustion etc. Under such situation a special (natural) a protective measure was awaited to fix environmental issues. Probably, the lockdown is one of the natural effects expected by nature via introduction of COVID-19. It is because, introduction of COVID-19 to nature was an outcome of mutation from two of its pre-existing forms, although, debate on it is still continuing. Viability of CoV-19 virus found to have a lot of correlation with aquatic and terrestrial environmental parameters such as pH, surface type, temperature etc. Air pollution is found to increase the risk of COVID-19 infection, therefore, use of mask and alcohols based standard sterilisers is strongly recommended. However, the self-revival rate of nature shall continue during post-lockdown period and a master plan must be adapted by national and international (mostly political) bodies to revive the Mother Nature completely.","Paital, Biswaranjan",Sci Total Environ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004896972032605X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139088; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388136/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972032605X?v=s5,426

In an attempt to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic numerous countries across the world have been shutting down economies, education, and public life. Governments have mandated strict regulations of quarantine and social distancing in an unprecedented manner. The effects of these measures on brain, behavior, neuro-humoral and immunological responses in humans are largely unknown. Life science research for space exploration has a long history in using high-fidelity spaceflight analogs to better understand the effect of prolonged isolation and confinement on genes, molecules, cells, neural circuits, and physiological systems to behavior. We here propose to leverage the extensive experience and data from these studies and build a bridge between spaceflight research and clinical settings to foster transdisciplinary approaches to characterize the neurobehavioral effects on the immune system and vice versa. These approaches are expected to develop innovative and efficient health screening tools, diagnostic systems, and treatments to mitigate health risks associated with isolation and confinement on Earth and during future exploratory spaceflight missions.","Choukér, Alexander; Stahn, Alexander C.",NPJ Microgravity,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-020-00122-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33110938/,426

Data are needed to characterize these infections and define correlates of breakthrough and infectivity. METHODS: At the largest medical center in Israel, we identified breakthrough infections by performing extensive evaluations of health care workers who were symptomatic (including mild symptoms) or had known infection exposure. These evaluations included epidemiologic investigations, repeat reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays, antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic testing (Ag-RDT), serologic assays, and genomic sequencing. Correlates of breakthrough infection were assessed in a case–control analysis. We matched patients with breakthrough infection who had antibody titers obtained within a week before SARS-CoV-2 detection (peri-infection period) with four to five uninfected controls and used generalized estimating equations to predict the geometric mean titers among cases and controls and the ratio between the titers in the two groups. We also assessed the correlation between neutralizing antibody titers and N gene cycle threshold (Ct) values with respect to infectivity. RESULTS: Among 1497 fully vaccinated health care workers for whom RT-PCR data were available, 39 SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections were documented. Neutralizing antibody titers in case patients during the peri-infection period were lower than those in matched uninfected controls (case-to-control ratio, 0.361; 95% confidence interval, 0.165 to 0.787). Higher peri-infection neutralizing antibody titers were associated with lower infectivity (higher Ct values). Most breakthrough cases were mild or asymptomatic, although 19% had persistent symptoms (>6 weeks). The B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant was found in 85% of samples tested. A total of 74% of case patients had a high viral load (Ct value, <30) at some point during their infection; however, of these patients, only 17 (59%) had a positive result on concurrent Ag-RDT. No secondary infections were documented. CONCLUSIONS: Among fully vaccinated health care workers, the occurrence of breakthrough infections with SARS-CoV-2 was correlated with neutralizing antibody titers during the peri-infection period. Most breakthrough infections were mild or asymptomatic, although persistent symptoms did occur.","Bergwerk, Moriah; Gonen, Tal; Lustig, Yaniv; Amit, Sharon; Lipsitch, Marc; Cohen, Carmit; Mandelboim, Michal; Gal Levin, Einav; Rubin, Carmit; Indenbaum, Victoria; Tal, Ilana; Zavitan, Malka; Zuckerman, Neta; Bar-Chaim, Adina; Kreiss, Yitshak; Regev-Yochay, Gili",N Engl J Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34320281/; https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa2109072,426

626080,Development and Effectiveness of a Patient Safety Education Program for Inpatients,2021-03-22,"OBJECTIVE Haematological cancer patients are particularly vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19. In addition to being immunocompromised, pandemic-related travel restrictions have impacted access to treatments and overseas stem cell donations for patients requiring transplantation. Given this vulnerability, people with haematological cancers are at risk of experiencing heightened distress during the pandemic. This study aimed to explore haematological cancer patients' experiences and needs. METHODS Twenty-four Australian haematological cancer patients completed semi-structured interviews exploring their concerns and worries during the pandemic, impact of pandemic on management of disease, access to information and support, lifestyle changes, and attitudes towards emerging models of healthcare during the pandemic. Interview transcripts were thematically analysed. RESULTS Four themes reflecting the experiences of haematological cancer patients during the pandemic were identified: 'Fears about contracting COVID-19' (behaviour changes to protect health, impact on daily routine and habits, annoyance at dismissive attitude of others toward COVID-19); 'Reduced sense of connection and support' (reduced social support and access to external support services); 'New challenges' (increased financial hardship, worsened health), and; 'Underlying system and communication issues' (access to trusted information, satisfaction/dissatisfaction with care, navigating telehealth). Participants expressed a need for improved access to support services and trusted information. CONCLUSIONS The findings emphasise the additional challenges experienced by haematological cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and their impact on daily life. Results point to the importance of validation of increased distress during periods of uncertainty; reinforcing recommendations about high-quality sources of information; and facilitating access to support services when face-to-face care is limited.","Zomerdijk, Nienke; Jongenelis, Michelle; Yuen, Eva; Turner, Jane; Huntley, Kathryn; Smith, Andrew; McIntosh, Megan; Short, Camille E",Psycho-oncology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34500498/; https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.5819,426

This study aims to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Saint Petersburg, Russia accounting for non-response bias. We recruited a sample of adults residing in St. Petersburg with random digit dialling. Telephone interview was followed by an invitation for an anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies tests - CMIA and ELISA. The seroprevalence estimates were corrected for non-response with the aid of bivariate probit model that jointly estimated individual propensity to agree to participate in the survey and seropositivity. 66,250 individuals were contacted, 6,440 adults agreed to be interviewed and blood samples were obtained from 1,038 participants between May 27, 2020 and June 26, 2020. Naive seroprevalence corrected for test characteristics was 9.0% (7.2-10.8) by CMIA and 10.5% (8.6-12.4) by ELISA. Correction for non-response decreased seroprevalence estimates to 7.4% (5.7-9.2) and 9.1% (7.2-10.9) for CMIA and ELISA, respectively. The most pronounced decrease in non-response bias-corrected seroprevalence was attributed to the history of any illnesses in the past 3 months and COVID-19 testing. Seroconversion was negatively associated with smoking status, self-reported history of allergies and changes in hand-washing habits. These results suggest that even low estimates of seroprevalence in Europe's fourth-largest city can be an overestimation in the presence of non-response. Serosurvey design should attempt to identify characteristics that are associated both with participation and seropositivity. Further population-based studies are required to explain the lower seroprevalence in smokers and participant reporting allergies.","Barchuk, A.; Skougarevskiy, D.; Titaev, K.; Shirokov, D.; Raskina, Y.; Novkunkskaya, A.; Talantov, P.; Isaev, A.; Pomerantseva, E.; Zhikrivetskaya, S.; Barabanova, L.; Volkov, V.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.02.20221309; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.02.20221309v1?rss=1,426

The clinician must perform a complete neurological examination to determine the neuroanatomic basis for the weakness. As for all species, the neuroanatomic diagnosis allows the clinician to generate an appropriate differential diagnosis, to design a diagnostic plan, to prognosticate, and ultimately to develop a treatment plan. Clinical challenges The cause(s) of neurological weakness in the cat may be difficult to determine without access to advanced imaging modalities, cerebrospinal fluid analysis or electrodiagnostics. However, an accurate neuroanatomic diagnosis allows the clinician to pursue preliminary anomalous (vertebral anomalies), metabolic (eg, diabetes mellitus, electrolyte abnormalities) and neoplastic differentials via blood work, vertebral column and thoracic radiography, and abdominal ultrasound. Subsequently, referral to a specialty veterinary hospital may be warranted to pursue advanced neurodiagnostics.

627278,"Post-Lockdown Effects on Students’ Mental Health in Romania: Perceived Stress, Missing Daily Social Interactions, and Boredom Proneness",2021-08-14,"In the context of epidemiology, policies for disease control are often devised through a mixture of intuition and brute-force, whereby the set of logically conceivable policies is narrowed down to a small family described by a few parameters, following which linearization or grid search is used to identify the optimal policy within the set. This scheme runs the risk of leaving out more complex (and perhaps counter-intuitive) policies for disease control that could tackle the disease more efficiently. In this article, we use techniques from convex optimization theory and machine learning to conduct optimizations over disease policies described by hundreds of parameters. In contrast to past approaches for policy optimization based on control theory, our framework can deal with arbitrary uncertainties on the initial conditions and model parameters controlling the spread of the disease, and stochastic models. In addition, our methods allow for optimization over policies which remain constant over weekly periods, specified by either continuous or discrete (e.g.: lockdown on/off) government measures. We illustrate our approach by minimizing the total time required to eradicate COVID-19 within the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model proposed by Kissler et al.

627816,Sleep During “Lockdown” in the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-12-05,"BACKGROUND: Prolonged periods of confined living on a cruise ship increase the risk for respiratory disease transmission. We describe the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Australian passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship and provide recommendations to mitigate future cruise ship outbreaks. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of Australian passengers who travelled on the Diamond Princess from 20 January until 4 February 2020 and were either hospitalised, remained in Japan or repatriated. The main outcome measures included an epidemic curve, demographics, symptoms, clinical and radiological signs, risk factors and length of time to clear infection. RESULTS: Among 223 Australian passengers, 56 were confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive. Forty-nine cases had data available and of these over 70% had symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Of symptomatic cases, 17% showed signs and symptoms before the ship implemented quarantine and a further two-thirds had symptoms within one incubation period of quarantine commencing. Prior to ship-based quarantine, exposure to a close contact or cabin mate later confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive was associated with a 3.78 fold (95% CI, 2.24–6.37) higher risk of COVID-19 acquisition compared to non-exposed passengers. Exposure to a positive cabin mate during the ship’s quarantine carried a relative risk of 6.18 (95% CI, 1.96–19.46) of developing COVID-19. Persistently asymptomatic cases represented 29% of total cases. The median time to the first of two consecutive negative PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 assays was 13 days for asymptomatic cases and 19 days for symptomatic cases (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Ship based quarantine was effective at reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 amongst Australian passengers, but the risk of infection was higher if an individual shared a cabin or was a close contact of a confirmed case. Managing COVID-19 in cruise ship passengers is challenging and requires enhanced health measures and access to onshore quarantine and isolation facilities.","Walker, Liz J.; Codreanu, Tudor A.; Armstrong, Paul K.; Goodwin, Sam; Trewin, Abigail; Spencer, Emma; Colquhoun, Samantha M.; Stephens, Dianne M.; Baird, Rob W.; Douglas, Nicholas M.; Cribb, Danielle; Owen, Rhonda; Kelly, Paul; Kirk, Martyn D.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255401; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34492022/,426
627872,Child Maltreatment and Public Health: Do Gaps in Response during the COVID-19 Pandemic Highlight Jurisdictional Complexities?,2021-06-25,"This work is motivated by the recent worldwide pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). When an epidemiological disease is prevalent, estimating the case fatality rate, the proportion of deaths out of the total cases, accurately and quickly is important as the case fatality rate is one of the crucial indicators of the risk of a disease. In this work, we propose an alternative estimator of the case fatality rate that provides more accurate estimate during an outbreak by reducing the downward bias (underestimation) of the naive CFR, the proportion of deaths out of confirmed cases at each time point, which is the most commonly used estimator due to the simplicity. The proposed estimator is designed to achieve the availability of real-time update by using the commonly reported quantities , the numbers of confirmed, cured, deceased cases, in the computation. To enhance the accuracy, the proposed estimator adapts a stratification, that allows the estimator to use information from heterogeneous strata separately. With the COVID-19 cases of China, South Korea and the United States, we numerically show the proposed stratification-based estimator plays a role of providing an early warning about the severity of a epidemiological disease that estimates the final case fatality rate accurately and shows faster convergence to the final case fatality rate.","Kim, B.; Kim, S.; Jang, W.; Jung, S.; Lim, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.23.20111484v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.23.20111484,426

Patients admitted to Merkezefendi State Hospital because of COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by RNA detection of virus by using polymerase chain reaction between March 24, 2020 and July 6, 2020, were screened retrospectively. The CHA2DS2-VASc and modified CHA2DS2-VASc score of all patients was calculated. Also, we received all patients’ complete biochemical markers including D-dimer, Troponin I, and c-reactive protein on admission. We enrolled 1000 patients; 791 were admitted to the general medical service and 209 to the ICU; 82 of these 209 patients died. The ROC curves of the CHA2DS2-VASc and M-CHA2DS2-VASc scores were analyzed. The cut-off values of these scores for predicting mortality were ≥ 3 (2 or under and 3). The CHA2DS2-VASc and M-CHA2DS2-VASc scores had an area under the curve value of 0.89 on the ROC. The sensitivity and specificity of the CHA2DS2-VASc scores were 81.7% and 83.8%, respectively; the sensitivity and specificity of the M-CHA2DS2-VASc scores were 85.3% and 84.1%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that CHA2DS2-VASc, Troponin I, D-Dimer, and CRP were independent predictors of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Using a simple and easily available scoring system, CHA2DS2-VASc and M-CHA2DS2-VASc scores can be assessed in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. These scores can predict mortality and the need for ICU hospitalization in these patients.","Gunduz, Ramazan; Yildiz, Bekir Serhat; Ozdemir, Ibrahim Halil; Cetin, Nurullah; Ozen, Mehmet Burak; Bakir, Eren Ozan; Ozgur, Su; Bayturan, Ozgur",J Thromb Thrombolysis,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11239-021-02427-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730303/,426

Graduates of medical schools in Korea are selected and serve as public health doctors (PHDs) for their mandatory military service. The duration of service is 3 years and PHDs comprise general practitioners and specialists. Some PHDs are selected as EIS officers with 3 weeks basic FETP training and work for central and provincial public health authorities to conduct epidemiological investigations. The total number of EIS officers is 31 as of 2012. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has 12 specialists, whereas specialists and each province has one or two EIS officers to administer local epidemiological investigations in 253 public health centers. The Korean EIS officers have successfully responded and prevented infectious diseases, but there is a unique limitation: the number of PHDs in Korea is decreasing and PHDs are not allowed to stay outside Korea, which makes it difficult to cope with overseas infectious diseases. Furthermore, after 3 years service, they quit and their experiences are not accumulated. KCDC has hired full-time EIS officers since 2012 to overcome this limitation.","Kwon, Geun-Yong; Moon, Shinje; Kwak, Wooseok; Gwack, Jin; Chu, Chaeshin; Youn, Seung-Ki",Osong Public Health Res Perspect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210909913000866; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24159559/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrp.2013.07.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210909913000866,426

The combination of prone positioning and non-invasive ventilation in conscious patients may have a role in improving oxygenation. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of prone positioning in spontaneously ventilating patients receiving non-invasive ventilation admitted to the intensive care. Clinical data of 81 patients admitted with COVID 19 pneumonia and acute hypoxic respiratory failure were retrieved from electronic medical records and examined. Patients who had received prone positioning in combination with non-invasive ventilation were identified. A total of 20 patients received prone positioning in conjunction with non-invasive ventilation. This resulted in improved oxygenation as measured by a change in PaO (2)/FiO (2) (P/F) ratio of 28.7 mmHg while prone, without significant change in heart rate or respiratory rate. Patients on average underwent 5 cycles with a median duration of 3 hours. There were no reported deaths, 7 of the 20 patients (35%) failed non-invasive ventilation and subsequently required intubation and mechanical ventilation. In our cohort of 20 COVID-19 patients with moderate acute hypoxic respiratory failure, prone positioning with non-invasive ventilation resulted in improved oxygenation. Prone positioning with non-invasive ventilation may be considered as an early therapeutic intervention in COVID-19 patients with moderate acute hypoxic respiratory failure.","Burton-Papp, Helmi C.; Jackson, Alexander I.

630854,The Association between Health and Culture: The Perspective of Older Adult Hospital In-Patients in Israel,2021-06-16,"Background: Formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases, being activated either by pro-resolving or proinflammatory ligands. FPR2-associated signal transduction pathways result in phosphorylation of several proteins and in NADPH oxidase activation. We, herein, investigated molecular mechanisms underlying phosphorylation of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), oxidative stress responsive kinase 1 (OSR1), and myristolated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) elicited by the pro-resolving FPR2 agonists WKYMVm and annexin A1 (ANXA1). Methods: CaLu-6 cells or p22phox(Crispr/Cas9) double nickase CaLu-6 cells were incubated for 5 min with WKYMVm or ANXA1, in the presence or absence of NADPH oxidase inhibitors. Phosphorylation at specific serine residues of HSP27, OSR1, and MARCKS, as well as the respective upstream kinases activated by FPR2 stimulation was analysed. Results: Blockade of NADPH oxidase functions prevents WKYMVm- and ANXA1-induced HSP-27(Ser82), OSR1(Ser339) and MARCKS(Ser170) phosphorylation. Moreover, NADPH oxidase inhibitors prevent WKYMVm- and ANXA1-dependent activation of p38MAPK, PI3K and PKCδ, the kinases upstream to HSP-27, OSR1 and MARCKS, respectively. The same results were obtained in p22phox(Crispr/Cas9) cells. Conclusions: FPR2 shows an immunomodulatory role by regulating proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory activities and NADPH oxidase is a key regulator of inflammatory pathways. The activation of NADPH oxidase-dependent pro-resolving downstream signals suggests that FPR2 signalling and NADPH oxidase could represent novel targets for inflammation therapeutic intervention.","Ammendola, Rosario; Parisi, Melania; Esposito, Gabriella; Cattaneo, Fabio",Antioxidants (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox10010134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33477989/,426

With increases in mental health difficulties and family violence already being seen, there is concern that the risk of child maltreatment risk may also be increased. The current study aimed to explore the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic for families identified to be at risk of child maltreatment in Victoria, Australia. Understanding the experiences of the pandemic for families already at risk is essential in identifying how to best support vulnerable parents and young children during this challenging time. Interviews were conducted with 11 parents currently involved with Child Protection Services, and nine clinicians working within a child and family health services, supporting clients with child protection involvement. Parents and clinicians described a range of pandemic related stressors including employment and financial stress, worry about infection and changes to service access. In addition, parents with children in out of home care discussed decreased access to their children resulting from physical distancing restrictions. Parents and clinicians perceived the pandemic to be having a negative impact on parent mental health, parenting stress and isolation. Although parents raised minimal concerns about the impact of the pandemic on child well-being, clinicians expressed concerns about the rise in risk factors for child maltreatment. Parents discussed a range of coping strategies which they perceived to be helpful during the pandemic, and clinicians and parents described the need for additional mental health support and support to access basic needs. The study highlights the importance of ensuring at risk families have access to parenting and mental health support throughout the pandemic and the importance of ensuring children within at-risk families are sighted and their safety assessed.","Fogarty, Alison; Jones, Andi; Evans, Kirsty; O'Brien, Jacquie; Giallo, Rebecca",Health & social care in the community,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34435399/; https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13555,426

631829,Multi–Criteria–Decision–Analysis (MCDA) for the Horizon Scanning of Health Innovations an Application to COVID 19 Emergency,2020-10-26,"After a period of rapidly declining U.S. COVID-19 incidence during January-March 2021, increases occurred in several jurisdictions (1,2) despite the rapid rollout of a large-scale vaccination program. This increase coincided with the spread of more transmissible variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, including B.1.1.7 (1,3) and relaxation of COVID-19 prevention strategies such as those for businesses, large-scale gatherings, and educational activities. To provide long-term projections of potential trends in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub teams used a multiple-model approach comprising six models to assess the potential course of COVID-19 in the United States across four scenarios with different vaccination coverage rates and effectiveness estimates and strength and implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) (public health policies, such as physical distancing and masking) over a 6-month period (April-September 2021) using data available through March 27, 2021 (4). Among the four scenarios, an accelerated decline in NPI adherence (which encapsulates NPI mandates and population behavior) was shown to undermine vaccination-related gains over the subsequent 2-3 months and, in combination with increased transmissibility of new variants, could lead to surges in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. A sharp decline in cases was projected by July 2021, with a faster decline in the high-vaccination scenarios. High vaccination rates and compliance with public health prevention measures are essential to control the COVID-19 pandemic and to prevent surges in hospitalizations and deaths in the coming months.","Borchering, Rebecca K.; Viboud, Cécile; Howerton, Emily; Smith, Claire P.; Truelove, Shaun; Runge, Michael C.; Reich, Nicholas G.; Contamin, Lucie; Levander, John; Salerno, Jessica; van Panhuis, Wilbert; Kinsey, Matt; Tallaksen, Kate; Obrecht, R.

ADP-ribose is covalently attached to target proteins by poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs), using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as a substrate. This modification can have a wide variety of effects on proteins including alteration of enzyme activity, protein–protein interactions, and protein stability. Several PARPs are induced by interferon (IFN) and are known to have antiviral properties, implicating ADP-ribosylation in the host defense response and suggesting that viral macrodomains may counter this response. Recent studies have demonstrated that viral macrodomains do counter the innate immune response by interfering with PARP-mediated antiviral defenses, stress granule formation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Here, we will describe the known functions of the viral macrodomains and review recent literature demonstrating their roles in countering PARP-mediated antiviral responses.","Alhammad, Yousef M.

Prevalence peaked in August (late winter in the southern hemisphere) when they were detected in 21.9% of specimens tested. HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 comprised 82.4% of all HCoVs detected. Positive specimens were used to develop novel reverse transcriptase real-time PCRs (RT-rtPCRs) for HCoV detection. An objective clinical severity score was assigned to each positive HCoV patient. Severity scores were similar to those from a random selection of young children who were positive for respiratory syncytial virus at a different time but from the same specimen population.

In addition to being associated with poor patient and staff satisfaction. This article describes the efforts of six tertiary care governmental hospitals in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that have enrolled in a collaborative improvement project to reduce ED boarding time. The hospitals implemented a multifaceted system intervention that included forming multidisciplinary flow improvement teams, implementing the National Health Service (NHS) SAFER patient flow bundle, visual management system and multidisciplinary ED bed huddles. By the end of the project, all hospitals significantly reduced ED boarding time with a pooled mean difference of – 7.1 hours (16.6 before, 9.5 hours after, p<0.001), reaching a pooled average of 2 hours in March 2020. Furthermore, by the end of the third learning session, all hospitals were able to achieve a boarding time below 6 hours. The enrolled hospitals also experienced an improvement in hospital flow process measures without any increase in 30-day readmission rates or bed occupancy rates. Our project demonstrates that implementing multifaceted system-wide interventions improves hospital flow and ED boarding time. Additionally, our project demonstrates a significant correlation between improvements in ED boarding time, daily consultant-led rounds and early discharge from inpatient units and time till discharge.","Alotaibi, Yasser; Alnowaiser, Noura; Alamry, Ahmed",BMJ Open Qual,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjoq-2021-001505; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34583936/,426

In this context, mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs), adipocyte mesenchymal stem cells (Ad-MSCs) and adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) possessing potent immunomodulatory activities are proposed as a therapeutic option for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The COVID-19 represents a global concern of public health caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in which there is not actually any specific therapy. MSCs exert an immunomodulation effect due to the secretion of endogenous factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin growth factor (IGF), and nerve growth factor (NGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and growth differentiation factor (GDF)-11. Recent reports are promising for further studies and clinical applications of ADSCs and Ad-MSCs in COVID-19 patients.

Thus, the physiological relevance of these studies is in question. This recognition motivated scientists to formulate the effect of crowded solutions in general, and excluded volume in particular, on biochemical processes. Using polymers or proteins as crowders, it was shown that while crowding tends to significantly enhance the formation of complexes containing many subunits, dimerizations are only mildly affected. Computer simulations, together with experimental evidence, indicate soft interactions and diffusion as critical factors that operate in a concerted manner with excluded volume to modulate protein binding. Yet, these approaches do not truly mimic the cellular environment. In vivo studies may overcome this shortfall. The few studies conducted thus far suggest that in cells, binding and folding occur at rates close to those determined in dilute solutions.

It is observed from the data on the infection rate available in the various sources that the cold and dry conditions accelerate the spread of coronavirus. In the present work, the existing theory of respiratory droplet drying is used to propose the mechanism of virus spread under various climates and the indoor environment conditions which plays a greater role in the virus spread. This concept is assessed using four major parameters such as population density, climate severity, the volume of indoor spaces, and air-conditioning usage which affect the infection spread and mortality using the data available for various states of India. Further, it is analysed using the data from various states in India along with the respective climatic conditions. It is found that under some indoor scenarios, the coronaviruses present in the respiratory droplets become active due to size reduction that occurs both in sessile and airborne droplet nuclei causing an increase in the spread. Understanding this mechanism will be very useful to take the necessary steps to reduce the rate of transmission by initiating corrective measures and maintaining the required conditions in the indoor built environment.","V, Antony Aroul Raj; R, Velraj; Haghighat, Fariborz",Sustain Cities Soc,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210670720305928; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834934/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2020.102371; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670720305928?v=s5,426

Here we combined screening of phage display random peptide libraries with a unique computer algorithm “Mapitope” to identify the discontinuous epitope of 80R, a potent neutralizing human anti-SARS monoclonal antibody against the spike protein. Using two different types of random peptide libraries which display cysteine-constrained loops or linear 13–15-mer peptides, independent panels containing 42 and 18 peptides were isolated, respectively. These peptides, which had no apparent homologous motif within or between the peptide pools and spike protein, were deconvoluted into amino acid pairs (AAPs) by Mapitope and the statistically significant pairs (SSPs) were defined. Mapitope analysis of the peptides was first performed on a theoretical model of the spike and later on the genuine crystal structure. Three clusters (A, B and C) were predicted on both structures with remarkable overlap. Cluster A ranked the highest in the algorithm in both models and coincided well with the sites of spike protein that are in contact with the receptor, consistent with the observation that 80R functions as a potent entry inhibitor. This study demonstrates that by using this novel strategy one can rapidly predict and identify a neutralizing antibody epitope, even in the absence of the crystal structure of its target protein.","Tarnovitski, Natalia; Matthews, Leslie J.; Sui, Jianhua; Gershoni, Jonathan M.; Marasco, Wayne A.",J Mol Biol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283606003159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16630634/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283606003159,426
637885,Risk Assessment of the SME Sector Operations during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-04-15,"A hybridisation-based genosensor was designed on a 100 nm sputtered gold film. This material worked as an immobilisation and transduction surface. A 30-mer sequence that encodes a short lysine-rich region, unique to SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus, was chosen as target. A complementary strand (probe), labelled with a thiol group at the 3′-end, was immobilised on the film. After blocking the surface, hybridisation with the biotin-conjugated SARS strand (at the 3′-end) took place. Interaction with alkaline phosphatase-labelled streptavidin permits amplified indirect electrochemical detection. The analytical signal is constituted by an electrochemical process of indigo carmine, the soluble product of the enzymatic hydrolysis of 3-indoxyl phosphate. The use of a sensitive electrochemical technique such as square wave voltammetry allowed a detection limit of 6 pM to be obtained for this DNA sequence, lower than any other found in the bibliography. The parameters affecting the methodology were studied, with special attention being placed on selectivity. Specificity was clearly enhanced when interaction time and stringency (in the form of formamide percentage) were increased. With 1 h of strand interaction and employing 50% of formamide in the hybridisation buffer, a 3-base mismatch strand was perfectly distinguished from the complementary.","Abad-Valle, Patricia; Fernández-Abedul, M.

Using an online survey enhanced by response time measurement, this study describes the overall patterns in mental well-being outcomes and examines their association with sociodemographic characteristics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, it identifies significant predictors for COVID-19 good practices. A total of 988 Lebanese were surveyed, with participants providing written online consent prior to filling the survey. Regression-based models were estimated. Findings show that individuals with higher education levels exhibit lower health concerns. People with children face higher health worries than those without. Men are more worried than women about their health and they are less satisfied with their lives during the pandemic. Descriptive statistics show that most Lebanese are very satisfied with their families (93.1%), but they are highly dissatisfied with their country (63%). Young adults and individuals who live alone exhibit significantly higher social well-being concerns. Age and having children were strong predictors for good COVID-19 practices. The odds of having good practices for older adults are 3.13 times higher than that of youth, while the odds for those with children are 3.18 times higher than those without. The findings of this study could pave the way for a well-coordinated national strategy and increased collaboration with public health professionals to mitigate the pandemic’s adverse effects on mental health in the long-term.","Bou-Hamad, Imad; Hoteit, Reem; Harajli, Dunia",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34324533/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254989,426

639399,A Multidimensional Model of Public Health Approaches Against COVID-19,2020-05-26,"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, pneumonia cases of unknown cause were announced in Wuhan, China. The causative agent of pneumonia was identified as coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). PURPOSE: To evaluate the usefulness of computed thoracic tomography (CT) and postero anterior (PA) thoracic radiography in patients with COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between March and June 2020, the patients who arrived at our hospital with suspicion of COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Thorax CT findings of the 281 patients (142 females and 139 males; age range 3–91 years) with positive PCR tests were evaluated. Lesions in the lung parenchyma were examined according to their number, localization, and distribution. PA chest radiograms were classified into two groups, positive and negative for the lung parenchymal lesions. RESULTS: Of the total 281 patients with PCR-positive COVID-19, CT examinations were normal in 107 (38.1%), and positive CT findings for pneumonia were found in 174 patients (61.9%). Bilateral involvement was observed in 100 (57.5%) of the 174 patients with positive CT findings, and unilateral involvement was observed in 74 (42.5%) of them. According to the localization of the lesions, peripheral subpleural distribution occurred in 160 of the 174 patients (91.9). The most common lesion was the ground glass opacities (GGO). In 77 of 281 PCR-positive patients (27.4), pulmonary lesions were found on PA chest radiograms. CONCLUSION: The presence of bilateral posterior subpleural GGO, nodule, and consolidation in thoracic CT are significant in terms of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Tiryaki, Şaban; Dabeşlim, Hakan; Aksu, Yusuf",Acta Radiol Open,https://doi.org/10.1177/2058460121989309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614161/,426

639866,Uganda Mountain Community Health System—Perspectives and Capacities towards Emerging Infectious Disease Surveillance,2021-08-13,"Balkan Endemic Nephropathy (BEN) is a chronic, progressive wasting disease of the kidneys, endemic in certain rural regions of the Balkan nations Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Romania. It is irreversible, and ultimately fatal. Though this disease was first described in the 1920s, its causes have been a mystery and a source of much academic and clinical contention. Possible etiologic agents that have been explored include exposure to metals and metalloids, viruses and bacteria, and the environmental toxins aristolochic acid (AA) and ochratoxin A (OTA). Aristolochic acid is a toxin produced by weeds of the genus Aristolochia, common in Balkan wheat fields. Aristolochia seeds may intermingle with harvested grains and thus inadvertently enter human diets. Ochratoxin A is a mycotoxin (fungal toxin) common in many foods, including cereal grains. In this study, we analyzed the weight of evidence for each of the suspected causes of BEN using the Bradford Hill Criteria (BHC): nine conditions that determine weight of evidence for a causal relationship between an agent and a disease. Each agent postulated to cause BEN was evaluated using the nine criteria, and for each criterion was given a rating based on the strength of the association between exposure to the substance and BEN. From the overall available scientific evidence for each of these suspected risk factors, aristolochic acid is the agent with the greatest weight of evidence in causing BEN. We describe other methods for testing causality from epidemiological studies, which support this conclusion of AA causing BEN.","Bui-Klimke, Travis; Wu, Felicia",Risk Analysis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24954501/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4199864?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.12239,426

640405,Modeling Spatiotemporal Pattern of Depressive Symptoms Caused by COVID-19 Using Social Media Data Mining,2020-07-10,"About 25% of EU workers experience work-related stress for all or most of their working time, showing that work-related stress is a major cause of health problems for the EU population. This situation has been worsened even more by the COVID-19 restrictions embraced by employers worldwide. However, a timely and sustainable intervention protocol for treating such issues has not been developed yet. Thus, the present research shows a first effective attempt based on Metacognitive therapy (MCT) to solve this issue. MCT was practiced on four individuals suffering from chronic work-related stress. Primary outcome variables were general mental health, perceived stress, and blood pressure. Participants were assessed at multiple baselines before the start of therapy and then attended a 3- and 6-months follow-up after treatment termination. Results showed significant improvements in general mental health, perceived stress, and blood pressure in each client. Secondary outcome variables improved too—maladaptive coping strategies, avoidance behaviors, and depression symptoms—corroborating the main findings. At 3- and 6-month follow-up, results were maintained. The findings suggest that MCT might be a promising and sustainable intervention for work-related stress, although a metacognitive model for stress and large-scale RCTs need to be developed and carried out to further explore the effect of MCT on stress. Our results represent one of the first attempts to treat work-related stress via Metacognitive Therapy and support the feasibility of the treatment, both in terms of its efficacy and sustainability, in a historical moment in which work-related stress is increased worldwide because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Within such a realm, our feasibility study should be followed by larger and controlled studies that, if successful, would provide various stakeholders—including organizational and institutional decision-makers—with a solid, timely and cost-effective method to help the workforce coping with work-related stress.","De Dominicis, Stefano; Troen, Maiken Lykke; Callesen, Pia",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.668245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34135788/,426

To examine the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in infected patients out of Wuhan, from China. METHODS: Thirteen patients were confirmed to be infected with novel coronavirus-2019 (2019-nCoV) between January 27 and February 8, 2020, in Baoji city, Shannxi, northwestern China. Epidemiological and clinical information, and computed to morphology imaging data from all COVID-19 patients were collected; cases were divided into two groups according to the severity of infection (mild or severe). RESULTS: Nine (9/13) COVID-19 patients exhibited mild disease severity, and defined as second-generation human-to-human transmission cases. Most patients (11/13) had a history of travel to or from Wuhan. There were no differences in sex and age between the mild and severe cases (all P > 0.05). A moderate degree of fever (11/13), cough (13/13), and fatigue (8/13) were common symptoms; however, there was no statistical difference between mild and severe cases in this regard (all P > 0.05). Oxyhemoglobin saturation and oxygenation index decreased, and C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) levels were elevated in all patients with COVID-19 infection, with statistically significant differences between those with severe disease and mild infection (all P < 0.05). Twelve of 13 COVID-19 patients exhibited changes in chest CT imaging features, and time course changes were different between mild and severe cases (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Most cases of COVID-19 infection were second-generation human-to-human transmissions from Wuhan and were mild in severity. The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 varied. Oxyhemoglobin saturation, oxygenation index, CRP and SAA levels, and CT features were reliable parameters to evaluate the severity of COVID-19 infection.

641386,First-Year College Student Life Experiences during COVID-19 in South Korea,2021-09-20,"INTRODUCTION: Approximately 20% of serious safety incidents involving palliative patients relate to medication. These are disproportionately reported when patients are in their usual residence when compared with hospital or hospice. While patient safety incident reporting systems can support professional learning, it is unclear whether these reports encompass patient and carer concerns with palliative medications or interpersonal safety. AIM: To explore and compare perceptions of (un)safe palliative medication management from patient, carer and professional perspectives in community, hospital and hospice settings. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will use an innovative mixed-methods study design combining systematic review searching techniques with cross-sectional quantitative descriptive analysis and interpretative qualitative metasynthesis to integrate three elements: (1) Scoping review: multiple database searches for empirical studies and first-hand experiences in English (no other restrictions) to establish how patients and informal carers conceptualise safety in palliative medication management. (2)Medication incidents from the England and Wales National Reporting and Learning System: identifying and characterising reports to understand professional perspectives on suboptimal palliative medication management. (3) Comparison of 1 and 2: contextualising with stakeholder perspectives. PATIENT AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT: Our team includes a funded patient and public involvement (PPI) collaborator, with experience of promoting patient-centred approaches in patient safety research. Funded discussion and dissemination events with PPI and healthcare (clinical and policy) professionals are planned. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Prospective ethical approval granted: Cardiff University School of Medicine Research Ethics Committee (Ref 19/28). Our study will synthesise multivoiced constructions of patient safety in palliative care to identify implications for professional learning and actions that are relevant across health and social care. It will also identify changing or escalating patterns in palliative medication incidents due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Peer-reviewed publications, academic presentations, plain English summaries, press releases and social media will be used to disseminate to the public, researchers, clinicians and policy-makers.","Yardley, Sarah; Francis, Sally-Anne; Chuter, Antony; Hellard, Stuart; Abernethy, Julia; Carson-Stevens, A",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-048696; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34518258/,426

Faecal samples were collected from preweaned calves, young stock and cows. Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected by sodium chloride flotation and epifluorescence microscopy. Molecular diagnostics were used to identify Cryptosporidium species. Samples containing C. parvum were further analysed to determine subtypes. Calf faecal samples were also analysed for rotavirus, coronavirus and Escherichia coli F5+. Total protein was assessed in 1- to 8-day-old calves. A questionnaire was used to identify differences in management routines. Cryptosporidium infection was diagnosed in all herds, with equal prevalence in case and control herds in all three age groups. Cryptosporidium parvum, Cryptosporidium bovis, Cryptosporidium ryanae and Cryptosporidium andersoni were all identified, as were rotavirus, coronavirus and E. coli F5+. C. ryanae and C. andersoni were only detected in non-diarrhoeal samples, whereas the other pathogens were detected in both diarrhoeal and non-diarrhoeal samples. Diarrhoea was more common in case herd calves. Disinfection of single pens was more common in case herds and several other management routines seemed to differ although results were not significant.","Silverlås, Charlotte; de Verdier, Kerstin; Emanuelson, Ulf; Mattsson, Jens G.; Björkman, Camilla",Parasitol Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00436-010-2020-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20714750/,426

642731,Influence of Face Masks on the Use of Contact Lenses,2021-07-11,"Abstract The genomic RNA and intracellular RNA of mouse hepatitis virus, strain JHM (MHV-JHM) and two plaque mutants (la and 2c), which have been isolated from a persistently infected culture (JHM-CC), have been analyzed by T1-resistant oligonucleotide finger-printing. The genomic RNA of the virus population (JHM-CC virus) released from different passage levels of the same persistent infection has also been analyzed. The analysis shows the locations within the genomic and intracellular RNAs of more than 45 T1-resistant oligonucleotides and confirm earlier studies (J. L. Leibowitz, K. C. Wilhelmsen, and C. W. Bond (1981), Virology 114, 39–51), showing that the six subgenomic RNAs of MHV-JHM form a 3′ coterminal nested set which extends for different lengths in a 5′ direction. The analysis also identifies in each subgenomic RNA those large T1 oligonucleotides derived from noncontiguous regions of the genome during mRNA synthesis. Two important conclusions can be reached from analysis of the mutant viruses. First, the virus population released from the persistent infection represents a fairly constant mixture of viruses, and the fluctuating emergence of variants as predominant species in the culture does not occur. Second, the data indicate that for particular intracellular RNAs of mutant viruses the sequence rearrangements occurring during subgenomic mRNA synthesis are different from those in the corresponding intracellular RNA of wild-type virus. The result may indicate a potential flexibility in the leader/body fusion process that has not been previously recognized.","Makino, Shinji; Taguchi, Fumihiro; Hirano, Norio; Fujiwara, Kosaku",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6093379/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682284903350; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682284903350,426

Results: The peak of COVID19 14day incidence in most NACEBEL sectors is reached in the period October 20 November 2, 2020 and was considerably higher than average in human health activities, residential care activities, fitness facilities, human resource provision, hairdressing and other beauty treatment and some public service activities. Human health activities, residential care activities, food and beverage service activities, hotels, arts, food retail activities, and human resources provision have high pre-lockdown incidences. The frequency of index cases that report more than two high risk contacts is increasing over time in all sectors. Conclusion: Despite the restrictive protocols present in many sectors before the Autumn wave, employees in activities where close contact with others is high, show increased risk of COVID19 infection. Especially sports activities are among the highest risk activities. Finally, the increasing amount of high risk contacts by COVID19 confirmed cases is compatible with the decreasing motivation over time to adhere to the measures.","Verbeeck, J.; Vanersmissen, L.; Peeters, J.; Klamer, S.; Hancart, S.; Lernout, T.; Dewatripont, M.; Godderis, L.; Molenberghs, G.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.31.21256946; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.31.21256946v1?rss=1,426

METHODS: Using a utilization-focused evaluation approach, qualitative interviews were conducted with former participants (clinicians, managers, or other key stakeholders) of medication management learning collaboratives organized and delivered by Alliance for Integrated Medication Management (AIMM). The purpose of the learning collaboratives was to provide structure and facilitation to accelerate the implementation of medication management services. One-on-one semi-structured interviews were carried out with a lead member of 11 different organizations that participated in an AIMM collaborative about their experience in the collaborative and the different implementation strategies that were used. RESULTS: Three themes emerged: (1) perspectives on the implementation strategies, (2) external facilitators, and (3) additional benefits of being in the collaborative. Certain implementation strategies used by AIMM, such as coaching, were considered beneficial by almost everyone while other strategies, such as webinars, had mixed opinions. Participants also highlighted the importance of external facilitators, like dedicated time to work on implementation strategies, as well as the additional benefits like the professional development that comes from being in a learning collaborative and learning different implementation strategies. CONCLUSION: Implementation strategies may help accelerate the adoption and expansion of medication management services within and across organizations. The results of this evaluation shed light on the experiences of different organizations using select implementation strategies in their medication management implementation efforts. The perspectives of participants in this study may help other organizations in selecting and developing similar implementation strategies.","Pestka, Deborah L.; Sorensen, Todd D.",Innov Pharm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34007678/; https://doi.org/10.24926/iip.v12i1.3610,426

Based on that event, the World Health Organization recommended that research be implemented to define modes of transmission of SARS coronavirus through sewage, feces, food and water. Environmental studies have shown that animal coronaviruses remain infectious in water and sewage for up to a year depending on the temperature and humidity. In this study, we examined coronavirus stability on lettuce surfaces. A cell culture adapted bovine coronavirus, diluted in growth media or in bovine fecal suspensions to simulate fecal contamination was used to spike romaine lettuce. qRT-PCR detected viral RNA copy number ranging from 6.6 × 10(4) to 1.7 × 10(6) throughout the experimental period of 30 days. Whereas infectious viruses were detected for at least 14 days, the amount of infectious virus varied, depending upon the diluent used for spiking the lettuce. UV and confocal microscopic observation indicated attachment of residual labeled virions to the lettuce surface after the elution procedure, suggesting that rates of inactivation or detection of the virus may be underestimated. Thus, it is possible that contaminated vegetables may be potential vehicles for coronavirus zoonotic transmission to humans.","Mullis, Lisa; Saif, Linda J.; Zhang, Yongbin; Zhang, Xuming; Azevedo, Marli S.P.",Food Microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22265299/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2011.12.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0740002011002814; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740002011002814,426
646040,Diagnostic Value of IgM and IgG Detection in COVID-19 Diagnosis by the Mobile Laboratory B-LiFE: A Massive Testing Strategy in the Piedmont Region,2021-03-24,"Objective Epidemiological studies suggest that individuals with comorbid conditions including diabetes, chronic lung diseases and others, are at higher risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Genome-wide association studies have identified several loci associated with increased susceptibility and severity for COVID-19. However, it is not clear whether these associations are genetically determined or not. We used a Phenome-Wide Association (PheWAS) approach to investigate the role of genetically determined COVID-19 susceptibility on disease related outcomes. Approach and Results PheWAS analyses were performed in order to identify traits and diseases related to COVID-19 susceptibility and severity, evaluated through a predictive COVID-19 risk score. We utilised phenotypic data in up to 400,000 individuals from the UK Biobank, including Hospital Episode Statistics and General Practice data. We identified a spectrum of associations between both genetically determined COVID-19 susceptibility and severity with a number of traits. COVID-19 risk was associated with increased risk for phlebitis and thrombophlebitis (OR = 1.11, p = 5.36e-08). We also identified significant signals between COVID-19 susceptibility with blood clots in the leg (OR= 1.1, p = 1.66e-16) and with increased risk for blood clots in the lung (OR = 1.12, p = 1.45 e-10). Conclusions Our study identifies significant association of genetically determined COVID-19 with increased blood clot events in leg and lungs. The reported associations between both COVID-19 susceptibility and severity and other diseases adds to the identification and stratification of individuals at increased risk, adverse outcomes and long-term effects.","Papadopoulou, A.; Musa, H.; Sivaganesan, M.; McCoy, D.; Deloukas, P.; Marouli, E.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.04.21256617v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.04.21256617,426
646142,Class of 2020 in Poland: Students’ Mental Health during the COVID-19 Outbreak in an Academic Setting,2021-03-11,"Objectives: To use publicly available data on mortality in England and Wales to estimate the extent of occupation risk from Covid19 among teachers and others working in schools. Design: Analysis of national death registration data from the Office for National Statistics. Setting: England and Wales from March 20th to 28th December 2020, during the Covid19 pandemic. Participants: We compared mortality rates among teachers and other school workers to all working aged people and all professional occupations. Primary and Secondary outcomes: Deaths with Covid19 was our primary outcome and death from all causes was our secondary outcome. Results: We found that the absolute mortality rates for deaths with Covid19 were generally low amongst teachers ([≤]39 per 100,000); they were also low relative to many other occupations. However, both male and female secondary school teachers had slightly higher risks of dying with Covid19 relative to all working aged people and greater risk compared to all professionals, primary school teachers did not have an elevated risk. The mortality risk for all causes was also higher in teachers compared to the working aged population. Excess deaths from all causes were higher among those aged over 65 who were working in schools compared to all over 65s who were currently working and compared to all professionals in this age group. Conclusion: There is weak evidence that secondary school teachers (in particular females) may have a slightly higher risk of Covid19 mortality, but compared to many other occupations their risk is low. Further research is needed to determine why there is a high proportion of excess of deaths which were apparently not due to Covid19 among over 65 year-olds working in schools.","Lewis, S.

646219,Reasons for Low Protection of Vulnerable Workers from COVID-19—Results from the Quantitative and Qualitative Study on Working Life in Latvia,2021-05-13,"BACKGROUND Since the end of 2019, COVID-19 has had a significant impact on citizens around the globe. As governments institute more restrictive measures, public adherence could decrease and discontent mount. Providing high-quality information and countering fake news is important. But we also need feedback loops so that government officials can refine preventive measures and communication strategies. Policy-makers need information - preferably based on real-time data - on the public's cognitive, emotional and behavioural reaction to public health messages and restrictive measures. PubliCo aims to foster effective and tailored risk and crisis communication as well as an assessment of the risks and benefits of prevention and control measures, as their effectiveness depends on public trust and cooperation. OBJECTIVE Our project aims to develop a tool that helps tackle the COVID-19 infodemic, with a focus on enabling a nuanced and in-depth understanding of public perception. The project adopts a trans-disciplinary multi-stakeholder approach, including participatory citizen science. METHODS We combine literature and media review and analysis and empirical research using mixed methods, including an online survey and diary-based research, both of which are ongoing and continuously updated. Building on real-time data and continuous data collection, our research results will be highly adaptable to the evolving situation. RESULTS As of September 2021, two thirds of the tool we propose are up and running. Current development cycles focus on the analytics component, on user experience, and on interface refinements. We collected a total of 473 responses through PubliCo Survey, and 22 diaries through PubliCo Diaries. CONCLUSIONS Pilot data show that PubliCo is a promising and efficient concept for bidirectional risk and crisis communication in the context of public health crises; further data are needed to assess its function at a larger scale or in the context of an issue other than COVID-19.

We sought to understand the evolving impacts of COVID-19 on ethnocultural communities to inform intersectoral advocacy and community action. METHODS: The Illuminate Project used participatory action research, with cultural health brokers as peer researchers, from Sept. 21 to Dec. 31, 2020, in Edmonton, Alberta. Twenty-one peer researchers collected narratives from members of ethnocultural communities and self-interpreted them as they entered the narratives into the SenseMaker platform, a mixed-method data collection tool. The entire research team analyzed real-time, aggregate, quantitative and qualitative data to identify emerging thematic domains, then visualized these domains with social network analysis. RESULTS: Brokers serving diverse communities collected 773 narratives. Identified domains illuminate the evolving and entangled impacts of COVID-19 including the following: COVID-19 prevention and management; care of acute, chronic and serious illnesses other than COVID-19; maternal care; mental health and triggers of past trauma; financial insecurity; impact on children and youth and seniors; and legal concerns. We identified that community social capital and cultural brokering are key assets that facilitate access to formal health and social system supports. INTERPRETATION: The Illuminate Project has illustrated the entangled, systemic issues that result in poor health among vulnerable members of ethnocultural communities, and the exacerbating effects of COVID-19, which also increased barriers to mitigation. Cultural brokering and community social capital are key supports for people during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings can inform policy to reduce harm and support community resiliency.","Campbell-Scherer, Denise; Chiu, Yvonne; Ofosu, Nicole Naadu; Luig, Thea; Hunter, Karen Heather; Jabbour, Badi; Farooq, Sauleha; Mahdi, Ali; Gayawira, Aline; Awasis, Fransiska; Olokude, Funke; Goa, Hannah; Syed, Hina; Sillito, Judy; Yip, Lydia; Belle, Lyn; Akot, Mawien; Nutter, Monique; Farhat, Nadia; Wang, Yan; Jalal, Niga; Khalif, Saida; Chapagain, Shiva; Fernandez, Stephanie; Azarcon, Susan; Hama, Zhewar",CMAJ,https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.210131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34373268/,426

The noticeable rise of MRSA and VRE was significantly correlated with the increased consumption of glycopeptides, β-lactam–β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems and fluoroquinolones (Pearson's correlation coefficient, P < 0.05). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 100 non-duplicate blood isolates of MRSA (in 2003) and of 25 non-duplicate isolates of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and 172 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (in 1996–2003) causing nosocomial infection recovered from various clinical specimens of patients treated at the hospital to nine antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. All of these isolates were susceptible to linezolid and were inhibited by 0.5 mg/L of tigecycline, and all MRSA isolates were inhibited by daptomycin 1 mg/L, including two isolates of MRSA with heteroresistance to vancomycin. Daptomycin had two-fold better activity against vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (MIC(90), 2 mg/L) than against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (MIC(90), 4 mg/L). Decreased susceptibilities of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and MRSA to quinupristin/dalfopristin (non-susceptibility 25% and 8%, respectively) were found. Telithromycin had poor activity against the isolates tested (MIC(90), 8 mg/L).

The first schools of public health soon followed, but growth was slow, with only 12 schools by 1960. With organization and growing numbers, accreditation became an expectation. As the mission of public health has grown and achieved new urgency, schools have grown in number, depth and breadth. By mid-2011, there were 46 accredited schools of public health, with more in the pipeline. While each has a unique character, they also must possess certain core characteristics to be accredited. Over time, as schools developed, and concepts of public health expanded, so too did curricula and missions as well as types of people who were trained. In this review, we provide a brief summary of US public health education, with primary emphasis on professional public health schools. We also examine public health workforce needs and evaluate how education is evolving in the context of a growing maturity of the public health profession. We have not focused on programs (not schools) that offer public health degrees or on preventive medicine programs in schools of medicine, since schools of public health confer the majority of master’s and doctoral degrees. In the future, there likely will be even more inter-professional education, new disciplinary perspectives and changes in teaching and learning to meet the needs of millennial students.","Rosenstock, Linda; Helsing, Karen; Rimer, Barbara K.",Public Health Rev,https://doi.org/10.1007/bf03391620; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226193/,426

This paper introduces the Subgroup Preference Neural Network (SGPNN) that combines multiple networks have different activation function, learning rate, and output layer into one artificial neural network (ANN) to discover the hidden relation between the subgroups’ multi-labels. The SGPNN is a feedforward (FF), partially connected network that has a single middle layer and uses stairstep (SS) multi-valued activation function to enhance the prediction’s probability and accelerate the ranking convergence. The novel structure of the proposed SGPNN consists of a multi-activation function neuron (MAFN) in the middle layer to rank each subgroup independently. The SGPNN uses gradient ascent to maximize the Spearman ranking correlation between the groups of labels. Each label is represented by an output neuron that has a single SS function. The proposed SGPNN using conjoint dataset outperforms the other label ranking methods which uses each dataset individually. The proposed SGPNN achieves an average accuracy of 91.4% using the conjoint dataset compared to supervised clustering, decision tree, multilayer perceptron label ranking and label ranking forests that achieve an average accuracy of 60%, 84.8%, 69.2% and 73%, respectively, using the individual dataset.","Elgharabawy, Ayman; Prasad, Mukesh; Lin, Chin-Teng",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34577312/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21186104,426

This introduction provides a context for understanding how and why occupations became a focus of inequalities research, especially in the Post-World War II English-speaking world. I then discuss some of the economic changes that have led some to question where occupations stand as a vehicle for analyzing social inequality, and then turn to a summary of the contributions to this issue. This summary is framed as a friendly family debate between those who wish to “fix and refurbish” the old reliable occupational perspective and those who think that researchers should “trade in” the old perspective for one focusing on firms and jobs. My review of the contributions to this issue suggests several avenues for future research including (1) new efforts to improve the quality of occupational coding, (2) a renewed focus on local labor markets as a better representation of where most people find employment, (3) an examination of whether occupational structures mattered more for explaining social inequalities in prior historical periods compared to the present, (4) examinations of how and where occupations matter cross-nationally, and finally (5) a renewed focus on units of measurement that people actually carry around with them and spend (dollars, euros, etc.) as opposed to logged earnings and socioeconomic status points.

There are very few studies which have considered an integrated solution to optimize all the hyperparameters. In this paper, we strive to achieve optimum values of all three hyperparameters for fuzzy time series forecasting of the COVID-19 pandemic using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. We specifically propose two techniques, namely nested FTS-PSO and exhaustive search FTS-PSO for determining the optimal interval length, as an augmentation to the FTS-PSO model that optimizes the interval length and the fuzzy order. Nested PSO has two PSO loops: (i) the inner PSO optimizes the combination of fuzzy order and boundaries of intervals for a given number of partitions defined by the outer loop, and the resultant cost is fed back to the outer PSO; (ii) the outer PSO optimizes the number of partitions to reduce the cost while meeting the defined constraint. Exhaustive search FTS-PSO also has two loops where the inner loop is similar to nested FTS-PSO while the outer loop iterates over a pre-defined search space of number of partitions. We analyze the effectiveness of the two approaches by comparing with ARIMA, FbProphet, and the state-of-the-art FTS and FTS-PSO models. We adopt COVID-19 highly affected 10 countries worldwide to perform forecasting of coronavirus confirmed cases. We consider two phases of COVID-19 spread, one from the year 2020 and another from 2021. Our study provides an analytical aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic, and aims to achieve optimal number and length of intervals along with fuzzy order for FTS forecasting of COVID-19.

This report is focused on HRV parameters kinetics before, during and after this lockdown period. METHODS: 95 participants were included in this study (27 women, 68 men, 37 ± 11 years, 176 ± 8 cm, 71 ± 12 kg), who underwent regular orthostatic tests (a 5-minute supine followed by a 5-minute standing recording of heart rate (HR)) on a regular basis before (BSL), during (CFN) and after (RCV) the lockdown. HR, power in low- and high-frequency bands (LF, HF, respectively) and root mean square of the successive differences (RMSSD) were computed for each orthostatic test, and for each position. Subjective well-being was assessed on a 0–10 visual analogic scale (VAS). The participants were split in two groups, those who reported an improved well-being (WB+, increase >2 in VAS score) and those who did not (WB-) during CFN. RESULTS: Out of the 95 participants, 19 were classified WB+ and 76 WB-. There was an increase in HR and a decrease in RMSSD when measured supine in CFN and RCV, compared to BSL in WB-, whilst opposite results were found in WB+ (i.e. decrease in HR and increase in RMSSD in CFN and RCV; increase in LF and HF in RCV). When pooling data of the three phases, there were significant correlations between VAS and HR, RMSSD, HF, respectively, in the supine position; the higher the VAS score (i.e., subjective well-being), the higher the RMSSD and HF and the lower the HR. In standing position, HRV parameters were not modified during CFN but RMSSD was correlated to VAS. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the strict COVID-19 lockdown likely had opposite effects on French population as 20% of participants improved parasympathetic activation (RMSSD, HF) and rated positively this period, whilst 80% showed altered responses and deteriorated well-being. The changes in HRV parameters during and after the lockdown period were in line with subjective well-being responses. The observed recordings may reflect a large variety of responses (anxiety, anticipatory stress, change on physical activity…) beyond the scope of the present study. However, these results confirmed the usefulness of HRV as a non-invasive means for monitoring well-being and health in this population.","Bourdillon, Nicolas; Yazdani, Sasan; Schmitt, Laurent; Millet, Grégoire P.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33180839/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242303,426
648383,Assessing Hotel Employee Knowledge on Risk Factors and Risk Management Procedures for Microbial Contamination of Hotel Water Distribution Systems,2021-03-29,"The COVID-19 pandemic propelled many employees into remote work arrangements, and face-to-face meetings were quickly replaced with virtual meetings. This rapid uptick in the use of virtual meetings led to much popular press discussion of virtual meeting fatigue (i.e., ""Zoom fatigue""), described as a feeling of being drained and lacking energy following a day of virtual meetings. In this study, we aimed to better understand how one salient feature of virtual meetings-the camera-impacts fatigue, which may affect outcomes during meetings (e.g., participant voice and engagement). We did so through the use of a 4-week within-person experience sampling field experiment where camera use was manipulated. Drawing from theory related to self-presentation, we propose and test a model where study condition (camera on versus off) was linked to daily feelings of fatigue; daily fatigue, in turn, was presumed to relate negatively to voice and engagement during virtual meetings. We further predict that gender and organizational tenure will moderate this relationship such that using a camera during virtual meetings will be more fatiguing for women and newer members of the organization. Results of 1,408 daily observations from 103 employees supported our proposed model, with supplemental analyses suggesting that fatigue affects same-day and next-day meeting performance. Given the anticipated prevalence of remote work even after the pandemic subsides, our study offers key insights for ongoing organizational best practices surrounding virtual meetings.

649679,Occupational Therapy in Mental Health via Telehealth during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-07-03,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease caused by a newly identified coronavirus called the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which was initially emerged in Wuhan, China in late December 2019 and then rapidly extended to other countries worldwide. COVID-19 is now known as a pandemic threat to global public health. It possesses a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infection to mild, moderate, and ultimately severe pneumonia accompanied by multi-organ system dysfunction that can cause the death of the afflicted patients. The host immune system plays a critical role in defending against potentially pathogenic microorganisms such as coronaviruses, and it eliminates and eradicates these invading agents by triggering effective immune responses. However, there exists evidence indicating that in critically ill cases of the COVID-19, dysregulated immune responses and hyper-inflammation lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure. Achieving a profound understanding of the pathological immune responses involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 will boost our comprehending of disease pathogenesis and its progression toward severe form, contributing to the identification and rational design of effective therapies. In this review, we have tried to summarize the current knowledge regarding the role of immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and also give a glimpse of the immune evasion strategies of this virus.","Lotfi, Ramin; Kalmarzi, Rasoul Nasiri; Roghani, Seyed Askar",Immunol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33928531/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12026-021-09198-0,426
649957,A Social Network Analysis of Tweets Related to Masks during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-11-07,"BACKGROUND: The spread of SARS-CoV-2, originating in Wuhan, China, was classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The governments of affected countries have implemented various measures to limit the spread of the virus. The starting point of this paper is the different government approaches, in terms of promulgating new legislative regulations to limit the virus diffusion and to contain negative effects on the populations. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to study how the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is linked to government policies and to analyze how different policies have produced different results on public health. METHODS: Considering the official data provided by 4 countries (Italy, Germany, Sweden, and Brazil) and from the measures implemented by each government, we built an agent-based model to study the effects that these measures will have over time on different variables such as the total number of COVID-19 cases, intensive care unit (ICU) bed occupancy rates, and recovery and case-fatality rates. The model we implemented provides the possibility of modifying some starting variables, and it was thus possible to study the effects that some policies (eg, keeping the national borders closed or increasing the ICU beds) would have had on the spread of the infection. RESULTS: The 4 considered countries have adopted different containment measures for COVID-19, and the forecasts provided by the model for the considered variables have given different results. Italy and Germany seem to be able to limit the spread of the infection and any eventual second wave, while Sweden and Brazil do not seem to have the situation under control. This situation is also reflected in the forecasts of pressure on the National Health Services, which see Sweden and Brazil with a high occupancy rate of ICU beds in the coming months, with a consequent high number of deaths. CONCLUSIONS: In line with what we expected, the obtained results showed that the countries that have taken restrictive measures in terms of limiting the population mobility have managed more successfully than others to contain the spread of COVID-19. Moreover, the model demonstrated that herd immunity cannot be reached even in countries that have relied on a strategy without strict containment measures.","Staffini, Alessio; Svensson, Akiko Kishi; Chung, Ung-Il; Svensson, Thomas",JMIR Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33750735/; https://doi.org/10.2196/24192,426

Our objective was to assess prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among the general population in Saudi Arabia during this pandemic. A descriptive cross-sectional approach was used targeting all accessible populations in Saudi Arabia. Data were collected from participants using an electronic pre-structured questionnaire. Psychological impact was assessed using the Arabic version of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). A total of 1597 participants completed the survey. In total, 17.1% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 10% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 12% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Depression, anxiety, and stress were significantly higher among females, younger respondents, and health care providers. Depression was higher among smokers, singles, and non-working respondents. Anxiety was higher among those reporting contacts with COVID-19 positive cases, previously quarantined and those with chronic health problems. Our findings reaffirm the importance of providing appropriate knowledge and specialized interventions to promote the mental well-being of the Saudi population, paying particular attention to high-risk groups.","Alamri, Hasan Saeed; Algarni, Abdullah; Shehata, Shehata F.; Al Bshabshe, Ali; Alshehri, Nada N.; ALAsiri, Abdalla M.; Hussain, Amjad H.; Alalmay, Abdulrahman Y.; Alshehri, Eman A.; Alqarni, Yahya; Saleh, Norah F.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17249183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33316900/,426

We examined whether sera from recovered and naive donors collected prior to, and following immunizations with existing mRNA vaccines, could neutralize the Wuhan-Hu-1 and B.1.351 variants. Pre-vaccination sera from recovered donors neutralized Wuhan-Hu-1 and sporadically neutralized B.1.351, but a single immunization boosted neutralizing titers against all variants and SARS-CoV-1 by up to 1000-fold. Neutralization was due to antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain and was not boosted by a second immunization. Immunization of naïve donors also elicited cross-neutralizing responses, but at lower titers.

653330,Cariogenic Risk and COVID-19 Lockdown in a Paediatric Population,2021-07-15,"The long-term pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requires sensitive and accurate diagnostic assays to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in infected individuals. Currently, RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus is mainly detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based nucleic acid assays, while SARS-CoV-2 antigen and antibody are identified by immunological assays. Both nucleic acid assays and immunological assays rely on the luminescence signals of specific luminescence probes for qualitative and quantitative detection. The exploration of novel luminescence probes will play a crucial role in improving the detection sensitivity of the assays. As innate probes, aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens) exhibit negligible luminescence in the free state but enhanced luminescence in the aggregated or restricted states. Moreover, AIEgen-based nanoparticles (AIE dots) offer efficient luminescence, good biocompatibility and water solubility, and superior photostability. Both AIEgens and AIE dots have been widely used for high-performance detection of biomolecules and small molecules, chemical/biological imaging, and medical therapeutics. In this review, the availability of AIEgens and AIE dots in nucleic acid assays and immunological assays are enumerated and discussed.

Limited knowledge about the molecular mechanisms driving these processes and lack of staging biomarkers hamper the ability to stratify patients for targeted therapeutics. We report here the results of a cross-sectional multi-omics analysis of hospitalized COVID19 patients revealing that seroconversion status associates with distinct underlying pathophysiological states. Seronegative COVID19 patients harbor hyperactive T cells and NK cells, high levels of IFN alpha, gamma and lambda ligands, markers of systemic complement activation, neutropenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. In seropositive patients, all of these processes are attenuated, observing instead increases in B cell subsets, emergency hematopoiesis, increased markers of platelet activation, and hypoalbuminemia.

Since these measures have been put in place, anecdotal reports describe a decrease in the number of endovascular therapy (EVT) treatments for acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion. The purpose of our study was to determine the effect on EVT for patients with acute ischemic stroke during the COVID-19 confinement. In this retrospective, observational study, data were collected from November 1, 2019, to April 15, 2020, at 17 stroke centers in countries where confinement measures have been in place since March 2020 for the COVID-19 pandemic (Switzerland, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Canada, and United States). This study included 1600 patients treated by EVT for acute ischemic stroke. Date of EVT and symptom onset-to-groin puncture time were collected. Mean number of EVTs performed per hospital per 2-week interval and mean stroke onset-to-groin puncture time were calculated before confinement measures and after confinement measures. Distributions (non-normal) between the 2 groups (before COVID-19 confinement versus after COVID-19 confinement) were compared using 2-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The results show a significant decrease in mean number of EVTs performed per hospital per 2-week interval between before COVID-19 confinement (9.0 [95% CI, 7.8–10.1]) and after COVID-19 confinement (6.1 [95% CI, 4.5–7.7]), (P<0.001).

In the present study, the fecal virome of a non-diarrheic Belgian piglet was determined. Although the virome of only a single piglet was analyzed, some interesting data were obtained, including the second complete genome of a pig group C rotavirus (RVC). This Belgian strain was only distantly related to the only other completely characterized pig RVC strain, Cowden. Its relatedness to RVC strains from other host species was also analyzed and the porcine strain found in our study was only distantly related to RVCs detected in humans and cows. The gene encoding the outer capsid protein VP7 belonged to the rare porcine G3 genotype, which might be serologically distinct from most other pig RVC strains. A putative novel RVC VP6 genotype was identified as well. A group A rotavirus strain also present in this fecal sample contained the rare pig genotype combination G11P[27], but was only partially characterized. Typical pig RVA genotypes I5, A8, and T7 were found for the viral proteins VP6, NSP1, and NSP3, respectively. Interestingly, the fecal virome of the piglet also contained an astrovirus and an enterovirus, of which the complete genomes were characterized. Results of the current study indicate that many viruses may be present simultaneously in fecal samples of non-diarrheic piglets. In this study, these viruses could not be directly associated with any disease, but still they might have had a potential subclinical impact on pig growth performance. The fast evolution of NGS will be a powerful tool for future diagnostics in veterinary practice. Its application will certainly lead to better insights into the relevance of many (sub)clinical enteric viral infections, that may have remained unnoticed using traditional diagnostic techniques.

656986,Fiscal Expenditures on Science and Technology and Environmental Pollution: Evidence from China,2020-11-25,"Background SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) have been associated with higher rate of transmission, and evasion of immunisation and antibody therapeutics. Variant sequencing is widely utilized in the UK. However, only 0.5% (~650k) of the 133 million cumulative positive cases worldwide were sequenced (in GISAID) on 08 April 2021 with 97% from Europe and North America and only ~0.25% (~320k) were variant sequences. This may be due to the lack of availability, high cost, infrastructure and expert staff required for sequencing. Public health decisions based on a non-randomised sample of 0.5% of the population may be insufficiently powered, and subject to sampling bias and systematic error. In addition, sequencing is rarely available in situ in a clinically relevant timeframe and thus, is not currently compatible with diagnosis and treatment patient care pathways. Therefore, we investigated an alternative approach using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping to detect the key single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with increased transmission and immune evasion in SARS-CoV-2 variants. Methods We investigated the utility of SARS-CoV-2 SNP detection with a panel of PCR-genotyping assays in a large data set of 640,482 SARS-CoV-2 high quality, full length sequences using a prospective in silico trial design and explored the potential impact of rapid in situ variant testing on the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment patient pathway. Results Five SNPs were selected by screening the published literature for a reported association with increased transmission and / or immune evasion. 344881 sequences contained one or more of the five SNPs. This algorithm of SNPs was found to be able to identify the four variants of concern (VOCs) and sequences containing the E484K and L452R escape mutations. Interpretation The in silico analysis suggest that the key mutations and variants of SARS-CoV-2 may be reliably detected using a focused algorithm of biologically relevant SNPs. This highlights the potential for rapid in situ PCR genotyping to compliment or replace sequencing or to be utilized instead of sequences in settings where sequencing is not feasible, accessible or affordable. Rapid detection of variants with in situ PCR genotyping may facilitate a more effective COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment patient pathway.","Borley, D.; Trevor, R.

We find that the pandemic-induced impact decreases the financial efficiency of MFIs; however, the social efficiency of MFIs is increased under the impact of COVID-19. To explore potential channels through which efficiency is influenced by the COVID-19 outbreak, we examine the supply and demand side of MFIs’ funding. We find that the lending rate mediates the relationship between the impact of COVID-19 and MFI efficiency, whereas the mediating role of the funding rate is negligible.","Zheng, Chen; Zhang, Junru",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1059056020302185?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1059056020302185,426

In turn, this has impacted timely treatment of patients and ability to train residents and fellows. The objective is to characterize how surgical practices in pediatric otolaryngology have been impacted by the pandemic through a cross sectional analysis over three years. METHODS: This cross-sectional study focuses on patients who underwent surgical procedures within the department of otolaryngology at a single tertiary pediatric hospital. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to compare subsets of patients from pre-pandemic in 2019, early-pandemic in 2020, and late-pandemic in 2021. RESULTS: Operative volume decreased by 87.57% in the early pandemic and 36.86% in the late pandemic. In the early pandemic, the greatest decreases were seen in airway reconstruction (100%), adenotonsillectomy (96.4%), adenoidectomy (94.7%), myringotomy with tympanostomy tube insertion (94.6%), frenulectomy (94.1%), and sinonasal procedures (93.3%), while in the late-pandemic adenotonsillectomy (42.4%) and myringotomy with tympanostomy tube insertion (70.1%) remained reduced when compared to pre-pandemic volume. Increased average case lengths in the early-pandemic (78.28 ± 51.95 min) and late-pandemic (71.91 ± 70.76 min) were observed when compared to pre-pandemic (52.26 ± 39.20 min) (p < 0.001). An increased proportion of multidisciplinary cases were completed in 2020 and 2021 (p < 0.001). In the 2020, 25% of cases were completed without trainee involvement. There was an overall decrease in case numbers for trainees and increase in cases without their involvement when compared to 2019 and 2021. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a decrease in pediatric otolaryngology surgical procedures, particularly at the onset of the pandemic. While surgical trainees saw a dramatic reduction in case numbers early on, one year into the pandemic case volume is increasing and trending to pre-pandemic numbers. More complex cases, as represented by patients requiring longer operative times, inpatient status, and more frequently multidisciplinary care, were seen in the early pandemic, while drastic reductions were seen in routine outpatient procedures.","Lloyd, Ashley M.; Behzadpour, Hengameh K.; Zalzal, Habib G.; Mamidi, Ishwarya S.; Crowder, Hannah R.; Lawlor, Claire M.; Preciado, Diego; Reilly, Brian K.",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34537547/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165587621003165?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165587621003165; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2021.110923,426

However, little is known about mental health problems during a low-incidence period of the pandemic without strict public health measures. OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate whether COVID-19–related risk factors for mental health problems persist beyond lockdown measures. We targeted a vulnerable population that is at risk of developing low mental health and assessed their daily dynamics of mood and emotion regulation after a strict lockdown. METHODS: During a postlockdown period in Germany (between August 8, 2020, and November 1, 2020), we conducted an ecological momentary assessment with 131 participants who experienced at least mild COVID-19–related distress and loneliness. To estimate negative mood inertia, we built a lag-1 three-level autoregressive model. RESULTS: We found that information exposure and active daily COVID-19 cases did not have an impact on negative mood amid a postlockdown period. However, there was a day-to-day carryover effect of negative mood. In addition, worrying about COVID-19, feeling restricted by COVID-19, and feeling lonely increased negative mood. CONCLUSIONS: The mental health of a vulnerable population is still challenged by COVID-19–related stressors after the lifting of a strict lockdown. This study highlights the need to protect mental health during postpandemic periods.","Haucke, Matthias; Liu, Shuyan; Heinzel, Stephan",JMIR Ment Health,https://doi.org/10.2196/29419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34347622/,426

BACKGROUND: The recent unprecedented coronavirus disease pandemic and the increased reports on the absence of personal protective equipment in South Africa places many health workers' lives at risk. Nurses spend most of their time with patients, which exposes them to fatal risks as they work in unsafe environments. RESEARCH METHODS: Exploratory literature review was conducted using Pubmed, CINAHL, Google Scholar and Science Direct) and law cases repository. FINDINGS: Nurses thus may be justified in striking to protect their safety. State healthcare entities are obliged to ensure safety and protect the health of professionals during the pandemic. According to their Code of Practice and Pledge of Service, they are ethically obliged to put patients first, and as a result, they are legally barred from engaging in strike action. CONCLUSION: We conclude that there may be constitutional human rights arguments to support strike action. We also find that ethical principles alone do not provide clear direction to guide nurses in making justified and ethical decisions regarding service provision in an environment threatening to compromise their safety.","Mavis Mulaudzi, Fhumulani; Mulaudzi, Mutondi; Anokwuru, Rafiat Ajoke; Davhana-Maselesele, Mashudu",Int Nurs Rev,https://doi.org/10.1111/inr.12703; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34551118/,426

In order to control the pandemic, rapid tests for detecting existing infections and assessing virus spread are critical. Approaches to detect viral RNA based on reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) hold outstanding promise towards greatly simplified and broadly applicable testing methods. RT-LAMP assays appear more robust than qPCR-based methods and only require incubation at a constant temperature, thus eliminating the need for sophisticated instrumentation. Here, we tested a two-color RT-LAMP protocol using clinical SARS-CoV-2 samples and also established a protocol that does not require prior RNA isolation (""swab-to-RT-LAMP""). Our study is based on several hundred clinical patient samples with a wide range of viral loads, thus allowing, for the first time, to accurately determine the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patients. We found that RT-LAMP can reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 samples with a qPCR threshold cycle number (CT value) of up to 30 in the standard RT-qPCR assay. We used both, either purified RNA or direct pharyngeal swab specimens and showed that RT-LAMP assays have, despite a decreased sensitivity compared to RT-qPCR, excellent specificity. We also developed a multiplexed LAMP-sequencing protocol as a validation and backup procedure to double-check the results of visual RT-LAMP assays. LAMP-sequencing is fully scalable and can assess the results of thousands of LAMP reactions in parallel. We propose decentralised COVID-19 testing as a routine to allow facilities and institutions to return to near-to-full functionality.","Dao Thi, V. L.; Herbst, K.; Boerner, K.; Meurer, M.; Kremer, L.

Additionally, investigations of prospective predictors of mask-wearing, COVID-19 symptoms, and viral testing remain wanting. PURPOSE: The present study examined prospective relations between demographic factors, personality traits, social cognitions and guideline adherence, mask-wearing, symptoms, and viral testing in a U.S. sample (N = 500) during the initial surge of COVID-19 deaths in the United State between late March and early May 2020. METHODS: Guided by a disposition-belief-motivation framework, correlational analyses, and path models tested associations among baseline personality traits, guideline adherence social cognitions, health beliefs, guideline adherence and follow-up guideline adherence, mask-wearing, symptom counts, and 30-day viral testing. RESULTS: Modeling results showed greater baseline agreeableness, conscientiousness, and extraversion were associated with more frequent baseline guideline adherence. More liberal political beliefs, greater guideline adherence intentions, and more frequent guideline adherence at baseline predicted more frequent mask-wearing at follow-up. Sex (female), lower perceived health, and greater neuroticism at baseline predicted greater symptom counts at follow-up. Reports of viral testing were quite low (1.80%), yet were consistent with concurrent national reporting and limited availability of testing. CONCLUSIONS: Results show how inconsistencies and politicization of health policy communication were concomitant with the effects of individual-level political beliefs on mask-wearing during the initial surge. The results further clarify how personality traits related to social responsibility (i.e., agreeableness, conscientiousness) are associated with following new norms for prescribed behaviors and how symptom reporting can be as much a marker of perceived health as emotional stability.","Milad, Elizabeth; Bogg, Tim",Ann Behav Med,https://doi.org/10.1093/abm/kaab039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33991096/,426

Methods: A national record linkage study determined documented COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in unvaccinated household members of vaccinated and unvaccinated healthcare workers from 8th December 2020 to 3rd March 2021. The primary endpoint was COVID-19 >= 14 days following the first dose. Results: The cohort comprised of 194,362 household members (mean age 31.1 years) and 144,525 healthcare workers (mean age 44.4 years). 113,253 (78.3%) of healthcare workers received at least one dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and 36,227 (25.1%) received a second dose. Household members of vaccinated healthcare workers had a lower risk of COVID-19 case compared to household members of unvaccinated healthcare worker (rate per 100 person-years 9.40 versus 5.93; HR 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.78). The effect size for COVID-19 hospitalization was similar, with the confidence interval crossing the null (HR 0.77 [0.53-1.10]). The rate per 100 person years was lower in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated healthcare workers for documented (20.13 versus 8.51; HR 0.45 [0.42-0.49]) and hospitalized COVID-19 (0.97 versus 0.14; HR 0.16 [0.09-0.27]).

Isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods offer significant advantages over the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), since they are more rapid and do not require the sophisticated instruments needed for thermal cycling. We previously described a novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification method, ‘Strand Invasion Based Amplification’ (SIBA®), with high analytical sensitivity and specificity, for the detection of DNA. In this study, we describe the development of a variant of the SIBA method, namely, reverse transcription SIBA (RT-SIBA), for the rapid detection of viral RNA targets. The RT-SIBA method includes a reverse transcriptase enzyme that allows one-step reverse transcription of RNA to complementary DNA (cDNA) and simultaneous amplification and detection of the cDNA by SIBA under isothermal reaction conditions. The RT-SIBA method was found to be more sensitive than PCR for the detection of influenza A and B and could detect 100 copies of influenza RNA within 15 min. The development of RT-SIBA will enable rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral RNA targets within point-of-care or central laboratory settings.

A retrospective cohort study was performed at Abington Hospital-Jefferson Health in gynecologic oncology. Women who underwent an exploratory laparotomy from 2011 to 2016 for both benign and malignant etiologies were included before and after implementation of our ERAS protocol. Patients who underwent a bowel resection were excluded. A total of 724 patients were included: 360 in the non-ERAS and 364 in the ERAS cohort.

This API is likely to be widely used by Covid-19 contact tracing apps. Measurements were collected between 60 pairs of Android handset locations and are publicly available. We find that the attenuation level reported by the GAEN API need not increase with distance between handsets, consistent with there being a complex radio environment inside a bus caused by the metal-rich environment. Changing the people sitting in a pair of seats can cause variations of ±10dB in the attenuation level reported by the GAEN API. Applying the rule used by the Swiss Covid-19 contact tracing app to trigger an exposure notification to our bus measurements we find that no exposure notifications would have been triggered despite the fact that all pairs of handsets were within 2m of one another for at least 15 mins. Applying an alternative threshold-based exposure notification rule can somewhat improve performance to a detection rate of 5% when an exposure duration threshold of 15 minutes is used, increasing to 8% when the exposure duration threshold is reduced to 10 mins. Stratifying the data by distance between pairs of handsets indicates that there is only a weak dependence of detection rate on distance.","Leith, Douglas J.; Farrell, Stephen",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33914810/,426

This observational study was conducted in a Model 4 tertiary referral center in Ireland. All patients referred for SARS‐CoV‐2 assessment over a 4‐week period were included. Patient demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbidities, medications, and outcomes (including length of stay, discharge, and mortality) were collected. Two hundred and seventy‐nine patients were assessed. These patients were predominantly female (62%) with a median age of 50 years (SD 16.9). Nineteen (6.8%) patients had SARS‐CoV‐2 detected. Dysgeusia was associated with a 16‐fold increased prediction of SARS‐CoV‐2 positivity (p = .001; OR, 16.8; 95% CI, 3.82–73.84).

667989,Social Support and Dietary Habits as Anxiety Level Predictors of Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-08-20,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to increased telemedicine visits. This study examines current preferences and barriers for telemedicine among patients with head and neck cancer. METHODS: Single institution retrospective analysis of 64 patients scheduling visits with the head and neck surgical oncology clinic at a tertiary academic medical center. Data were collected detailing patient preferences and barriers regarding telemedicine appointments. Patients electing to participate in telemedicine were compared to those preferring in‐person appointments. RESULTS: Most patients (68%) were not interested in telemedicine. Preference for in‐person examination was the most common reason for rejecting telemedicine, followed by discomfort with or limited access to technology. Patients elected telemedicine visits to avoid infection and for convenience. CONCLUSIONS: When given a choice, patients with head and neck cancer preferred in‐person visits over telemedicine. Although telemedicine may improve health care access, patient preferences, technology‐related barriers, and limitations regarding cancer surveillance must be addressed moving forward.","Fassas, Scott; Cummings, Emily; Sykes, Kevin J.; Bur, Andrés M.; Shnayder, Yelizaveta; Kakarala, Kiran",Head Neck,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33660409/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.26659,426
668306,"Is There a Temporal Relationship between COVID-19 Infections among Prison Staff, Incarcerated Persons and the Larger Community in the United States?",2021-06-26,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) posed unexpected global economic and societal challenges. These include a heavy impact on mental health due to fast changing lockdown and quarantine measures, uncertainty about health and safety and the prospect of new waves of infections. To provide crisis mental health support during the pandemic, Eötvös Loránd University in Hungary launched a specialist online counselling programme, consisting of one to three sessions. The programme was available to all university members between 4th March and 25th May 2020. Overall, 47 clients received support. In this paper we discuss challenges reported by clients, key features of providing a brief mental health intervention online, reflect on counsellor experiences and give recommendations on how mental health services could be developed in the time of crisis. Most clients had challenges with developing a daily routine under quarantine; and many had hardship related to finances, housing, and distance learning. Common mental health consequences included fear from the virus and stress, anxiety, and fatigue due to the interruption to everyday life. In some cases, more complex conditions were triggered by the pandemic. Examples include addictive behaviours and symptoms of depression or psychosis. However, referring cases beyond the competency of counselling proved to be a challenge due to the closure of specialist services. Counsellors observed three key features to the online delivery of a brief crisis mental health intervention: [1] an explicit problem-oriented approach to counselling; [2] challenges of building rapport online; and [3] frames of online counselling. Counsellor experiences often overlapped with those of clients and included challenges of working from home and adjusting to online counselling methods. The possibility of online counselling allowed that mental health care could take place at all during the pandemic. Client experiences reflect findings from previous literature. Like other mental health initiatives launched to tackle COVID-19, the intervention's effectiveness was not measured given the unexpected context and short time frame for programme development. We recommend the use of impact measurement tools to develop mental health services in crises. Meanwhile, the pandemic brought to attention the need to better understand online delivery models. Counsellors should have access to training opportunities on online counselling and managing work-life balance in a remote setting. The COVID-19 counselling programme in Eötvös Loránd University, Hungary is an example of providing online mental health counselling in the time of crisis. Clearly, more studies are needed discussing delivery models and effectiveness of mental health interventions during the pandemic. Experience and knowledge sharing across practitioners should be encouraged to improve how the field reacts to unexpected, high risk events and crises.","Szlamka, Zsófia; Kiss, Márta; Bernáth, Sámuel; Kámán, Péter; Lubani, Amina; Karner, Orsolya; Demetrovics, Zsolt",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34135783/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.655211,426
668499,Is It High Time to Increase Elite Soccer Substitutions Permanently?,2020-09-25,"For various infectious diseases, vaccination has become a major intervention strategy. However, the importance of social distancing has recently been highlighted during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In the absence of vaccination, or when vaccine efficacy is poor, social distancing may help to curb the spread of new virus strains. However, both vaccination and social distancing are associated with various costs. It is critical to consider these costs in addition to the benefits of these strategies when determining the optimal rates of application of control strategies. We developed a game-theoretic epidemiological model that considers vaccination and social distancing under the assumption that individuals pursue the maximization of payoffs. By using this model, we identified the individually optimal strategy based on the Nash strategy when both strategies are available and when only one strategy is available. Furthermore, we determined the relative costs of control strategies at which individuals preferentially adopt vaccination over social distancing (or vice versa).","Choi, Wongyeong; Shim, Eunha",J Theor Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519320302770; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519320302770?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32717195/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2020.110422,426
668544,Preparing for the Next Wave of COVID-19: Resilience in the Face of a Spreading Pandemic,2020-06-08,"Understanding seasonal human mobility at subnational scales has important implications across sciences, from urban planning efforts to disease modelling and control. Assessing how, when, and where populations move over the course of the year, however, requires spatially and temporally resolved datasets spanning large periods of time, which can be rare, contain sensitive information, or may be proprietary. Here, we aim to explore how a set of broadly available covariates can describe typical seasonal subnational mobility in Kenya pre-COVID-19, therefore enabling better modelling of seasonal mobility across low- and middle-income country (LMIC) settings in non-pandemic settings. To do this, we used the Google Aggregated Mobility Research Dataset, containing anonymized mobility flows aggregated over users who have turned on the Location History setting, which is off by default. We combined this with socioeconomic and geospatial covariates from 2018 to 2019 to quantify seasonal changes in domestic and international mobility patterns across years. We undertook a spatiotemporal analysis within a Bayesian framework to identify relevant geospatial and socioeconomic covariates explaining human movement patterns, while accounting for spatial and temporal autocorrelations. Typical pre-pandemic mobility patterns in Kenya mostly consisted of shorter, within-county trips, followed by longer domestic travel between counties and international travel, which is important in establishing how mobility patterns changed post-pandemic. Mobility peaked in August and December, closely corresponding to school holiday seasons, which was found to be an important predictor in our model. We further found that socioeconomic variables including urbanicity, poverty, and female education strongly explained mobility patterns, in addition to geospatial covariates such as accessibility to major population centres and temperature. These findings derived from novel data sources elucidate broad spatiotemporal patterns of how populations move within and beyond Kenya, and can be easily generalized to other LMIC settings before the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding such pre-pandemic mobility patterns provides a crucial baseline to interpret both how these patterns have changed as a result of the pandemic, as well as whether human mobility patterns have been permanently altered once the pandemic subsides. Our findings outline key correlates of mobility using broadly available covariates, alleviating the data bottlenecks of highly sensitive and proprietary mobile phone datasets, which many researchers do not have access to. These results further provide novel insight on monitoring mobility proxies in the context of disease surveillance and control efforts through LMIC settings.","Ruktanonchai, Corrine W.; Lai, Shengjie; Utazi, Chigozie E.; Cunningham, Alex D.; Koper, Patrycja; Rogers, Grant E.; Ruktanonchai, Nick W.; Sadilek, Adam; Woods, Dorothea; Tatem, Andrew J.; Steele, Jessica E.; Sorichetta, Alessandro",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-94683-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34321509/,426

However, in many cases, the dynamic component of mobility data is not considered directly. In this paper, we study how topological indexes and community structure changes in a business day. For the analyzes, we use a mobility database with a high temporal resolution. Our case study is the city of São José dos Campos (Brazil)—the city is divided into 55 traffic zones. More than 20 thousand people were asked about their travels the day before the survey (Origin-Destination Survey). We generated a set of graphs, where each vertex represents a traffic zone, and the edges are weighted by the number of trips between them, restricted to a time window. We calculated topological properties, such as degree, clustering coefficient and diameter, and the network’s community structure. The results show spatially concise community structures related to geographical factors such as highways and the persistence of some communities for different timestamps. These analyses may support the definition and adjustment of public policies to improve urban mobility. For instance, the community structure of the network might be useful for defining inter-zone public transportation.","Lamosa, Jéssica D.; Tomás, Lívia R.; Quiles, Marcos G.; Londe, Luciana R.; Santos, Leonardo B.

Hence, this study assessed the prevalence of mental health symptoms as well as emotional reactions among sub-Saharan Africans (SSAs) and associated factors among SSAs during the COVID-19 lockdown period. This was a web-based cross-sectional study on mental health and emotional features from 2005 respondents in seven SSA countries. This study was conducted between 17 April and 17 May 2020 corresponding to the lockdown period in most SSA countries. Respondents aged 18 years and above and the self-reported symptoms were feeling anxious, being worried, angry, bored and frustrated. These were the main outcomes and were treated as dichotomous variables. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify the factors associated with these symptoms. We found that over half (52.2%) of the participants reported any of the mental health symptoms and the prevalence of feeling bored was 70.5% followed by feeling anxious (59.1%), being worried (57.5%), frustrated (51.5%) and angry (22.3%) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multivariate analysis revealed that males, those aged >28 years, those who lived in Central and Southern Africa, those who were not married, the unemployed, those living with more than six persons in a household, had higher odds of mental health and emotional symptoms. Similarly, people who perceived low risk of contracting the infection, and those who thought the pandemic would not continue after the lockdown had higher odds of mental health and emotional symptoms. Health care workers had lower odds for feeling angry than non-healthcare workers. During the COVID-19 lockdown periods in SSA, about one in two participants reported mental health and emotional symptoms. Public health measures can be effectively used to identify target groups for prevention and treatment of mental health and emotional symptoms. Such interventions should be an integral component of SSA governments’ response and recovery strategies of any future pandemic.","Langsi, Raymond; Osuagwu, Uchechukwu L; Goson, Piwuna Christopher; Abu, Emmanuel Kwasi; Mashige, Khathutshelo P; Ekpenyong, Bernadine; Ovenseri-Ogbomo, Godwin O; Chikasirimobi G, Timothy; Miner, Chundung Asabe; Ishaya, Tanko; Oloruntoba, Richard; Nwaeze, Obinna; Charwe, Deborah Donald; Agho, Kingsley Emwinyore",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18030899; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33494209/,426

We previously found that allergic mice with eosinophil-rich inflammation were protected from severe influenza and discovered specialized antiviral effector functions for eosinophils including promoting cellular immunity during influenza. In this study, we hypothesized that eosinophil responses during the early phase of influenza contribute to host protection. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we found that eosinophils were rapidly and dynamically regulated upon influenza A virus (IAV) exposure to gain migratory capabilities to traffic to lymphoid organs after pulmonary infection. Eosinophils were capable of neutralizing virus upon contact and combinations of eosinophil granule proteins reduced virus infectivity through hemagglutinin inactivation. Bi-directional crosstalk between IAV-exposed epithelial cells and eosinophils occurred after IAV infection and cross-regulation promoted barrier responses to improve antiviral defenses in airway epithelial cells. Direct interactions between eosinophils and airway epithelial cells after IAV infection prevented virus-induced cytopathology in airway epithelial cells in vitro, and eosinophil recipient IAV-infected mice also maintained normal airway epithelial cell morphology. Our data suggest that eosinophils are important in the early phase of IAV infection providing immediate protection to the epithelial barrier until adaptive immune responses are deployed during influenza.","Tiwary, Meenakshi; Rooney, Robert J.; Liedmann, Swantje; LeMessurier, Kim S.; Samarasinghe, Amali E.",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33673645/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10030509,426

This paper presents these challenges and potential solutions. METHODS: Real-world examples and situations are reviewed from an industry and patient-reported outcome (PRO) expert position. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the pursuit of new therapeutic targets, changes to the regulatory environment, and business pressures to expand clinical trials to more countries have significantly increased the complexity of confirmatory clinical studies that incorporate PROMs. Decisions to participate in collaborative efforts for endpoint development or proceed independently are made in the context of competing priorities of drug development timelines, drug differentiation strategies, the need for patient-related value messages, and the depth of a sponsor pipeline within specific disease areas. Study logistics are critically important; factors such as concept cultural relevancy, respondent literacy level, and quality of cross-cultural adaptation of PROMs must be evaluated when integrating into confirmatory clinical trials.

We used a novel style of electropositive filter media particle to concentrate the SARS-CoV from the sewage of two hospitals receiving SARS patients in Beijing. We also used cell culture, RT-PCR and gene sequencing to detect and identify the viruses from sewage. No infectious SARS-CoV contamination was found in any of the samples collected, but the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV could be detected in the sewage from the two hospitals before disinfection. While the RNA was only detected in three samples from the 309th Hospital, the others were negative after disinfection.

In this study, we examined whether the variations of the cis-acting elements between the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) Taiwan (TW) strain and the prototype strain CV777 alter gene expression. For this aim, we analyzed the variations of the cis-acting elements in the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) between the PEDV TW, CV777, and other reference strains. We also determined the previously unidentified transcription regulatory sequence (TRS), a sequence motif required for coronavirus transcription, and found that a nucleotide deletion in the TW strain, in comparison with CV777 strain, immediately downstream of the leader core sequence alters the identity between the leader TRS and the body TRS. Functional analyses using coronavirus defective interfering (DI) RNA revealed that such variations in cis-acting elements for the TW strain compared with the CV777 strain have an influence on the efficiency of gene expression. The current data show for the first time the evolution of PEDV in terms of cis-acting elements and their effects on gene expression, and thus may contribute to our understanding of recent PED outbreaks worldwide.","Tsai, Tsung-Lin; Su, Chen-Chang; Hsieh, Ching-Chi; Lin, Chao-Nan; Chang, Hui-Wen; Lo, Chen-Yu; Lin, Ching-Houng; Wu, Hung-Yi",Genes (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/genes9120591; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30501108/,426

But the changing patterns of HIV and AIDS incidence based on the longitudinal observation data were rarely studied. METHODS: The reporting incidence (RI) and mortality data on HIV and AIDS in China covering 31 provinces from 2004 to 2014 were collected from the Chinese Public Health Science Data Center. To decompose the time-series data, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) was applied to properly describe the trends of HIV and AIDS incidence. A mathematical model was used to estimate the relative change of incidence among provinces and age groups. RESULTS: A total of 483,010 newly HIV infections and 214,205 AIDS cases were reported between 2004 and 2014 nationwide. HIV infection increased from 13,258 in 2004 (RI 1.02 per 100,000 person years) to 74,048 in 2014 (RI 5.46 per 100,000). The number of AIDS cases increased from 3054 in 2004 (RI 0.23 per 100,000) to 45,145 in 2014 (RI 3.33 per 100,000). The overall relative changes for HIV infection and AIDS incidence were 1.11 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10–1.13) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.23–1.33), respectively. The relative increase for HIV and AIDS RI was higher in northwest provinces while lower in Henan, Xinjiang, Guangxi and Yunnan. The overall relative changes for HIV infection were 1.12 (95% CI 1.11–1.14) in males and 1.10 (95% CI 1.06–1.13) in females. For AIDS RI, the relative increases were 1.31 (95% CI 1.26–1.36) in males and 1.22 (95% CI 1.17–1.28) in females. The lowest relative increase was detected among young adults, while the largest relative increase (odds ratio [OR] > 1.30) was detected in people aged 55 years or above. CONCLUSIONS: HIV and AIDS showed an increasing trend in China from 2004 to 2014, respectively, but the epidemic tended to be under control among provinces and young people that used to have a high HIV and AIDS incidence. Northwest China and older people could be new “hop-spots” for HIV and AIDS risk.","Liu, Zhenqiu; Shi, Oumin; Yan, Qiong; Fang, Qiwen; Zuo, Jialu; Chen, Yue; Chen, Xingdong; Zhang, Tiejun",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-018-3551-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587142/,426

By predicting patients' individualized disease development and further performing intervention in time, we may rationalize scarce medical resources and reduce mortality. Based on 1337 multi- stage ([≥]3) high-resolution chest computed tomography (CT) images of 417 infected patients from three centers in the epidemic area, we proposed a random forest + cellular automata (RF+CA) model to forecast voxel-level lesion development of patients with COVID-19. The model showed a promising prediction performance (Dice similarity coefficient [DSC] = 71.1%, Kappa coefficient = 0.612, Figure of Merit [FoM] = 0.257, positional accuracy [PA] = 3.63) on the multicenter dataset. Using this model, multiple driving factors for the development of lesions were determined, such as distance to various interstitials in the lung, distance to the pleura, etc. The driving processes of these driving factors were further dissected and explained in depth from the perspective of pathophysiology, to explore the mechanism of individualized development of COVID-19 disease.

Although the world has mobilized to create antiviral vaccines and therapeutics to combat the scourge, their long-term efficacy remains in question especially with the emergence of new variants. In this work, we exploit a class of compounds that has previously shown success against various viruses. A salicylanilide library was first screened in a SARS-CoV-2 activity assay in Vero cells. The most efficacious derivative was further evaluated in a prophylactic mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection unveiling a salicylanilide that can reduce viral loads, modulate key cytokines, and mitigate severe weight loss involved in COVID-19 infections. The combination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, cytokine inhibitory activity, and a previously established favorable pharmacokinetic profile for the lead salicylanilide renders salicylanilides in general as promising therapeutics for COVID-19.","Blake, Steven; Shaabani, Namir; Eubanks, Lisa M.; Maruyama, Junki; Manning, John T.; Beutler, Nathan; Paessler, Slobodan; Ji, Henry; Teijaro, John R.; Janda, Kim D.",ACS Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsinfecdis.1c00253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34339171/,426

The concept of the anomaly is typically ill defined and perceived as vague and domain-dependent. Moreover, despite some 250 years of publications on the topic, no comprehensive and concrete overviews of the different types of anomalies have hitherto been published. By means of an extensive literature review this study therefore offers the first theoretically principled and domain-independent typology of data anomalies and presents a full overview of anomaly types and subtypes. To concretely define the concept of the anomaly and its different manifestations, the typology employs five dimensions: data type, cardinality of relationship, anomaly level, data structure, and data distribution. These fundamental and data-centric dimensions naturally yield 3 broad groups, 9 basic types, and 63 subtypes of anomalies. The typology facilitates the evaluation of the functional capabilities of anomaly detection algorithms, contributes to explainable data science, and provides insights into relevant topics such as local versus global anomalies.","Foorthuis, Ralph",Int J Data Sci Anal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41060-021-00265-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34368422/; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15634v4.pdf,426

We evaluated the accuracy of a whole-blood stimulation test based on Interleukin (IL)-4 detection in response to Antigen B (AgB) of Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato to discriminate cyst viability and detect cyst reactivation in patients with hepatic CE. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Thirty patients with CE3b cysts and 37 patients with spontaneously-inactivated CE4-CE5 cysts were recruited (T0). After enrollment, 5 patients with CE3b cysts received albendazole, resulting in cyst solidification (CE4) in 4/5. Within a two-year follow-up, the whole-blood test was repeated at two time-points, in ≥14 (T1) and in ≥4 (T2) patients per group. IL-4 and a panel of other soluble factors were measured in the stimulated plasma. Baseline IL-4 levels were significantly higher in patients with CE3b compared to those with CE4 cysts (p = 0.006). Test accuracy for CE3b diagnosis had a sensitivity of 33–60% and a specificity of 76–95%, depending on the cut-off applied. Overall, IL-4 levels did not change significantly over time in either group; however, patients within the CE3b group showed a significant decrease of IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF, IFN-γ, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, FGF at T1 compared to T0 (p≤0.042). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Whole-blood IL-4-response to AgB is significantly higher in patients with active compared to inactive CE but apparently not modulated over time after treatment. On the contrary, the levels of IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF, IFN-γ, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, FGF significantly decreased in active CE during follow-up.

However, there are no studies regarding HP prevalence among medical students. The objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence of HP infection and assess the prevalence of dyspepsia in medical students and the relationship between dyspepsia and infection. We included 150 students from the Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Cluj-Napoca, Romania (102 females and 48 males, mean age 21 years). Each student completed a lifestyle questionnaire, personal history, family history as well as the Rome IV questionnaire for functional dyspepsia. The status of HP infection was determined using the C13-urea respiratory test. The prevalence of HP infection was 25.33%, and 18% met the Rome IV criteria for functional dyspepsia. 37% of students with functional dyspepsia had a positive HP test. Of all students, 8% had a history of HP infection. Those with a history of HP infection had a 4.45% (95% CI 1.6 – 12.37) higher risk of having positive Rome IV criteria for functional dyspepsia than those with no previous history of infection (p=0.008). Thus, the present study adds to the body of evidence regarding HP prevalence among medical students, 25.33% being positive. We found no statistically significant correlation between HP infection and functional dyspepsia. Those with a history of HP infection had a higher risk of functional dyspepsia.","Loor, Alexandra; Dumitrascu, Dan-Lucian; Surdea-Blaga, Teodora; Leucuta, Daniel-Corneliu; David, Liliana",J Med Life,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34621372/; https://doi.org/10.25122/jml-2021-0163,426

677119,"Objective Behavioral Measures in Children before, during, and after the COVID-19 Lockdown in Israel",2021-08-18,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) is a major source of health management systems. Moreover, the demand for mHealth, which is in need of change due to the COVID-19 pandemic, is increasing worldwide. Accordingly, interest in health care in everyday life and the importance of mHealth are growing. OBJECTIVE: We developed the MibyeongBogam (MBBG) app that evaluates the user’s subhealth status via a smartphone and provides a health management method based on that user’s subhealth status for use in everyday life. Subhealth is defined as a state in which the capacity to recover to a healthy state is diminished, but without the presence of clinical disease. The objective of this study was to compare the awareness and status of subhealth after the use of the MBBG app between intervention and control groups, and to evaluate the app’s practicality. METHODS: This study was a prospective, open-label, parallel group, randomized controlled trial. The study was conducted at two hospitals in Korea with 150 healthy people in their 30s and 40s, at a 1:1 allocation ratio. Participants visited the hospital three times as follows: preintervention, intermediate visit 6 weeks after the intervention, and final visit 12 weeks after the intervention. Key endpoints were measured at the first visit before the intervention and at 12 weeks after the intervention. The primary outcome was the awareness of subhealth, and the secondary outcomes were subhealth status, health-promoting behaviors, and motivation to engage in healthy behaviors. RESULTS: The primary outcome, subhealth awareness, tended to slightly increase for both groups after the uncompensated intervention, but there was no significant difference in the score between the two groups (intervention group: mean 23.69, SD 0.25 vs control group: mean 23.1, SD 0.25; P=.09). In the case of secondary outcomes, only some variables of the subhealth status showed significant differences between the two groups after the intervention, and the intervention group showed an improvement in the total scores of subhealth (P=.03), sleep disturbance (P=.02), depression (P=.003), anger (P=.01), and anxiety symptoms (P=.009) compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the MBBG app showed potential for improving the health, especially with regard to sleep disturbance and depression, of individuals without particular health problems. However, the effects of the app on subhealth awareness and health-promoting behaviors were not clearly evaluated. Therefore, further studies to assess improvements in health after the use of personalized health management programs provided by the MBBG app are needed. The MBBG app may be useful for members of the general public, who are not diagnosed with a disease but are unable to lead an optimal daily life due to discomfort, to seek strategies that can improve their health.

At the time of writing this (October 14, 2020), more than 38.4 million people have become affected, and 1.0 million people have died across the world. The death rate is undoubtedly correlated with the cytokine storm and other pathological pulmonary characteristics, as a result of which the lungs cannot provide sufficient oxygen to the body's vital organs. While diversified drugs have been tested as a first line therapy, the complexity of fatal cases has not been reduced so far, and the world is looking for a treatment to combat the virus. However, to date, and despite such promise, we have received very limited information about the potential of nanomedicine to fight against COVID-19 or as an adjunct therapy in the treatment regimen. Over the past two decades, various therapeutic strategies, including direct-acting antiviral drugs, immunomodulators, a few non-specific drugs (simple to complex), have been explored to treat Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), influenza, and sometimes the common flu, thus, correlating and developing specific drugs centric to COVID-19 is possible.

Here, we report an analysis of 133,816 samples collected between April and September 2020 and tested by Dorfman pooling for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. We spared 76% of RNA extraction and RT-PCR tests, despite the frequently changing prevalence (0.5 to 6%).

679031,COVID-19 and the Political Economy of Mass Hysteria,2021-02-03,"BACKGROUND: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, coronaviruses caused two noteworthy outbreaks: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), starting in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), starting in 2012. We aimed to assess the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases (from their inception until March 18, 2020), and medRxiv, bioRxiv, and PsyArXiv (between Jan 1, 2020, and April 10, 2020) were searched by two independent researchers for all English-language studies or preprints reporting data on the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of individuals with suspected or laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infection (SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, or SARS coronavirus 2). We excluded studies limited to neurological complications without specified neuropsychiatric presentations and those investigating the indirect effects of coronavirus infections on the mental health of people who are not infected, such as those mediated through physical distancing measures such as self-isolation or quarantine. Outcomes were psychiatric signs or symptoms; symptom severity; diagnoses based on ICD-10, DSM-IV, or the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (third edition) or psychometric scales; quality of life; and employment. Both the systematic review and the meta-analysis stratified outcomes across illness stages (acute vs post-illness) for SARS and MERS. We used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis, and the meta-analytical effect size was prevalence for relevant outcomes, I(2) statistics, and assessment of study quality. FINDINGS: 1963 studies and 87 preprints were identified by the systematic search, of which 65 peer-reviewed studies and seven preprints met inclusion criteria. The number of coronavirus cases of the included studies was 3559, ranging from 1 to 997, and the mean age of participants in studies ranged from 12·2 years (SD 4·1) to 68·0 years (single case report). Studies were from China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Canada, Saudi Arabia, France, Japan, Singapore, the UK, and the USA. Follow-up time for the post-illness studies varied between 60 days and 12 years. The systematic review revealed that during the acute illness, common symptoms among patients admitted to hospital for SARS or MERS included confusion (36 [27·9%; 95% CI 20·5–36·0] of 129 patients), depressed mood (42 [32·6%; 24·7–40·9] of 129), anxiety (46 [35·7%; 27·6–44·2] of 129), impaired memory (44 [34·1%; 26·2–42·5] of 129), and insomnia (54 [41·9%; 22·5–50·5] of 129). Steroid-induced mania and psychosis were reported in 13 (0·7%) of 1744 patients with SARS in the acute stage in one study. In the post-illness stage, depressed mood (35 [10·5%; 95% CI 7·5–14·1] of 332 patients), insomnia (34 [12·1%; 8·6–16·3] of 280), anxiety (21 [12·3%; 7·7–17·7] of 171), irritability (28 [12·8%; 8·7–17·6] of 218), memory impairment (44 [18·9%; 14·1–24·2] of 233), fatigue (61 [19·3%; 15·1–23·9] of 316), and in one study traumatic memories (55 [30·4%; 23·9–37·3] of 181) and sleep disorder (14 [100·0%; 88·0–100·0] of 14) were frequently reported. The meta-analysis indicated that in the post-illness stage the point prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder was 32·2% (95% CI 23·7–42·0; 121 of 402 cases from four studies), that of depression was 14·9% (12·1–18·2; 77 of 517 cases from five studies), and that of anxiety disorders was 14·8% (11·1–19·4; 42 of 284 cases from three studies). 446 (76·9%; 95% CI 68·1–84·6) of 580 patients from six studies had returned to work at a mean follow-up time of 35·3 months (SD 40·1). When data for patients with COVID-19 were examined (including preprint data), there was evidence for delirium (confusion in 26 [65%] of 40 intensive care unit patients and agitation in 40 [69%] of 58 intensive care unit patients in one study, and altered consciousness in 17 [21%] of 82 patients who subsequently died in another study). At discharge, 15 (33%) of 45 patients with COVID-19 who were assessed had a dysexecutive syndrome in one study. At the time of writing, there were two reports of hypoxic encephalopathy and one report of encephalitis. 68 (94%) of the 72 studies were of either low or medium quality. INTERPRETATION: If infection with SARS-CoV-2 follows a similar course to that with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, most patients should recover without experiencing mental illness. SARS-CoV-2 might cause delirium in a significant proportion of patients in the acute stage. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of depression, anxiety, fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder, and rarer neuropsychiatric syndromes in the longer term.

We aimed to: (1) identify and assess the quality of information that commercial manufacturers provided for their point-of-care tests (POCTs) and (2) examine the implications of these findings on real-world settings. DESIGN: We used a content analysis methodology in two stages to systematically, code and analyse textual data from documents of commercial manufacturers. A deductive approach was applied using a coding guide based on the validated Point-of-Care Key Evidence Tool (POCKET) multidimensional checklist. An inductive approach was used to identify new patterns or themes generated from our textual analysis. SETTING: Publicly available supportive information documents by commercial manufacturers for lateral flow serology, were identified and gathered from online searches. PARTICIPANTS: Supportive information documents retrieved from online searches over 3 months (March 2020 to June 2020). RESULTS: A total of 79 POCTs were identified that met the study inclusion criteria. Using the POCKET coding guide, we found that the quality of information varied significantly between the manufacturers and was often lacking in detail. Our inductive approach further examined these topics and found that several statements were vague and that significant variations in the level of details existed between manufacturers. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed significant concerns surrounding the supportive information reported by manufacturers for lateral flow serology assays. Information transparency was poor and human factor issues were not properly addressed to mitigate the risk of improper device use, although it should be noted that the results of our study are limited by the data that manufactures were prepared to disclose. Overall, commercial manufacturers should improve the quality and value of information presented in their supporting documentation.","Kierkegaard, Patrick; McLister, Anna; Buckle, Peter",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33741675/,426
679631,"Decrease in Ambient Fine Particulate Matter during COVID-19 Crisis and Corresponding Health Benefits in Seoul, Korea",2020-07-22,"[Image: see text] This study introduces an innovative device for the noninvasive sampling and chromatographic analysis of different compounds present in exhaled breath aerosol (EBA). The new sampling device, especially in light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic that forced many countries to impose mandatory facemasks, allows an easy monitoring of the subject’s exposure to different compounds they may come in contact with, actively or passively. The project combines the advantages of a fabric-phase sorptive membrane (FPSM) as an in vivo sampling device with a validated LC-MS/MS screening procedure able to monitor more than 739 chemicals with an overall analysis time of 18 min. The project involves the noninvasive in vivo sampling of the EBA using an FPSM array inserted inside an FFP2 mask. The study involved 15 healthy volunteers, and no restrictions were imposed during or prior to the sampling process regarding the consumption of drinks, food, or drugs. The FPSM array-LC-MS/MS approach allowed us to effectively exploit the advantages of the two complementary procedures (the convenient sampling by an FPSM array and the rapid analysis by LC-MS/MS), obtaining a powerful and green tool to carry out rapid screening analyses for human exposure to different compounds. The flexible fabric substrate, the sponge-like porous architecture of the high-efficiency sol–gel sorbent coating, the availability of a large cache of sorbent coatings, including polar, nonpolar, mixed mode, and zwitterionic phases, the easy installation into the facemask, and the possibility of sampling without interrupting regular activities provide FPSMs unparalleled advantages over other sampling techniques, and their applications are expected to expand to many other clinical or toxicological studies.","Locatelli, Marcello; Tartaglia, Angela; Ulusoy, Halil I.; Ulusoy, Songul; Savini, Fabio; Rossi, Sandra; Santavenere, Francesco; Merone, Giuseppe M.; Bassotti, Elisa; D’Ovidio, Cristian; Rosato, Enrica; Furton, Kenneth G.; Kabir, Abuzar",Anal Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33470800/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c04663,426
679889,Modeling and Forecasting the COVID-19 Temporal Spread in Greece: An Exploratory Approach Based on Complex Network Defined Splines,2020-06-30,"COVID-19 serological antibody tests are recently needed for a relatively quick, affordable, and valuable assessment of the immunity toward COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, they can help with evaluating the sufficiency of the vaccination process and its longevity. There are limitations in the current approach of choosing the positive and negative control samples for the validation of those tests. Herein, we are proposing the use of blood samples from positive COVID-19 patients, at the beginning of the disease course, as negative control blood samples for the antibody tests. For more precision, both the negative and the positive control samples can be obtained from the same patients where the accuracy of the test will depend on its ability to detect the seroconversion, from negative to positive antibodies detection, within the same patient. Furthermore, when the validation of the test is accompanied by detecting/sequencing the viral genome in those COVID-19 patients, this can also aid in determining the accuracy of the test in detecting the immune response to specific viral variants. The latter notion is needed for the proper management of the COVID-19 crisis, new vaccines' manufacturing, and evaluating the vaccines' efficiencies. Finally, this approach could be requested/formulated by the regulatory agencies as part of the tests’ validation and can be “in-house” obtained by health facilities before its clinical use.","Alrabadi, Nasr; Haddad, Razan; Al-Faouri, Ibrahim; Obeidat, Nail; Al-Ghazo, Mohammad; El-Salem, Khalid; Elnasser, Ziad; Mhaidat, Nizar",Ann Med Surg (Lond),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2049080121002703?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898040/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102320; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2049080121002703,426
679930,Impact of Social Media on Skin Cancer Prevention,2021-05-09,"INTRODUCTION: From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, guidance from WHO has promoted social distancing, wearing face masks, frequent hand washing, and staying-at-home as measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. For many across Africa, compliance can be difficult. The aim of this study was to 1) understand the impact of student’s household’s ability to comply with COVID-19 mitigation strategies, 2) identify predictors of mitigation strategy compliance, and 3) describe the impact of COVID-19 on household economics, food-security, and mental well-being. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an email-based survey among current medical and pharmacy students of the University of Liberia College of Health Sciences between July and October 2020. The questionnaire was designed to explore their household’s ability to comply with current mitigation strategies, as well as the pandemic´s impact on the student’s household’s finances and food security. Descriptive statistics were used to delineate demographic characteristics. Logistic regression was used to model factors associated with ability to comply with COVID-19 mitigation strategies, as well as participant’s food security. RESULTS: 113 persons responded to the questionnaire. Seventy-six (67∙3%) reported income losses as a result of the pandemic, with 93 (82∙3%) reporting being “somewhat” or “very worried” about their households’ finances. Seventy-seven (68∙1%) participants reported food stocks that were sufficient for one-week or less. Forty (35%) participants reported eating less preferred foods or skipping meals in the past week. Overall, 20 participants (19∙4%) had a positive depression screen. CONCLUSIONS: Study participants showed mixed results in being able to adhere to national COVID-19 mitigation strategies, with household level stressors experienced around finances and food security. Until Liberia has access to vaccinations for most of its citizens, COVID-19 response measures need to provide social protections that address basic needs (shelter, clothing and food), and which specifically targets food insecurity. Preventative interventions for mental health problems must be incorporated into Liberia’s response to the pandemic.","Davis, Elvis J.; Amorim, Gustavo; Dahn, Bernice; Moon, Troy D.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254446; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34242378/,426

For some viruses, antibody concentrations correlate with host protection and viral neutralization, but in rare cases, anti-viral antibodies can promote disease progression. Elucidation of the kinetics and magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response is essential to understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and identify potential therapeutic targets. METHODS: Sera (n=533) from patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 (n=94 with acute infections and n=59 convalescent patients) were tested using a high-throughput quantitative IgM and IgG assay that detects antibodies to the spike protein receptor binding domain and nucleocapsid protein. Individual and serial samples covered the time of initial diagnosis, during the disease course, and following recovery. We evaluated antibody kinetics and correlation between magnitude of the response and disease severity. RESULTS: Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 antibody production varied considerably. Among 52 patients with 3 or more serial specimens, 44 (84.6%) and 42 (80.8%) had observed IgM and IgG seroconversion at a median of 8 and 10 days, respectively. Compared to those with milder disease, peak measurements were significantly higher for patients admitted to the intensive care unit for all time intervals between 6 and 20 days for IgM, and all intervals after 5 days for IgG. CONCLUSIONS: High sensitivity assays with a robust dynamic range provide a comprehensive picture of host antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. IgM and IgG responses were significantly higher in patients with severe than mild disease. These differences may affect strategies for seroprevalence studies, therapeutics and vaccine development.","Lynch, Kara L; Whitman, Jeffrey D; Lacanienta, Noreen P; Beckerdite, Erica W; Kastner, Shannon A; Shy, Brian R; Goldgof, Gregory M; Levine, Andrew G; Bapat, Sagar P; Stramer, Susan L; Esensten, Jonathan H; Hightower, Allen W; Bern, Caryn; Wu, Alan H B",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa979; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32663256/,426

Our goal was to leverage real-world data spanning two COVID-19 surges over the first year of the pandemic to determine the temporal trend of in-hospital mortality. Design: This was an observational, retrospective study based on real-world data for patients admitted with COVID-19. Generalized additive models (GAM) were used to evaluate the association of covariates with the composite outcome over time. Setting and Population: We identified a retrospective cohort of all patients who were hospitalized within the Yale New Haven Health (YNHH) system with an admission diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and February 28, 2021. Main outcome: The primary outcome for the study was a composite endpoint of in-hospital mortality, defined as death during the index hospitalization or discharge to hospice. Results: Among 6,477 discharges over the study period, the mean age was 66.2 years (SD=17.6), 52.5% (n=3,401) were male and the overall composite mortality was 14.2% (n=920). Composite in-hospital mortality was significantly associated with increased age, comorbidity index, respiratory rate, and heart rate; decreased systolic blood pressure; male sex; and admission from a long-term care facility (LTCF). The significant temporal decrease in mortality that was observed for patients admitted from a location other than a LTCF was not seen in those admitted from a LTCF. Conclusions: We found that the adjusted in-hospital mortality rate declined over the first year of the pandemic, despite a second surge in COVID-19-related hospitalizations. Importantly, the decrease in mortality appeared to be driven by declines in risk in those not admitted from a LTCF. The observed decrease in mortality over time suggests that improved outcomes may be due to progressive, incremental learning and continuous evolution in hospital practice and policy over the course of the pandemic.","Warner, F.; Hitchings, M.

These models reveal three distinct functional domains, in which an intervening loop connecting domains II and III as well as a catalytic cleft containing the substrate binding subsites S1 and S2 between domains I and II are observed. S2 exhibits structural variations more significantly than S1 during the 200 ps molecular dynamics simulations because it is located at the open mouth of the catalytic cleft and the amino acid residues lining up this subsite are least conserved. In addition, the higher structural variation of S2 makes it flexible enough to accommodate a bulky hydrophobic residue from the substrate.","Liu, Hsuan-Liang; Lin, Jin-Chung; Ho, Yih; Chen, Chin-Wen",Chem Phys Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226085/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009261404018044; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cplett.2004.11.030; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009261404018044,426

In this article, we review the published literature and media reports to determine factors that may contribute to mental health challenges in persons with autoimmune disease. We then explore existing mental health interventions that have been developed for use in COVID‐19 and in patients with autoimmune disorders in general. We identified several potential contributors to psychological distress in patients with autoimmune disease during the pandemic, as follows: feelings of discrimination related to societal response to COVID‐19, fear of infection and uncertainty related to immunosuppressive medication, diminished access to usual care and resources, previous health‐related trauma, and the exacerbating effect of social isolation. Drawing from existing literature, we synthesize the identified evidence to develop a proposed framework for researching and managing mental health challenges in autoimmune disease during the pandemic and its aftermath.","Bingham, Kathleen S.; Rozenbojm, Nathalie; Chong‐East, Mariah; Touma, Zahi",ACR Open Rheumatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33314738/; https://doi.org/10.1002/acr2.11205,426

In this paper, the preclinical study of baicalein on the treatment of COVID-19 was performed. Results showed that baicalein inhibited cell damage induced by SARS-CoV-2 and improved the morphology of Vero E6 cells at a concentration of 0.1 μM and above. The effective concentration could be reached after oral administration of 200 mg/kg crystal form β of baicalein in rats. Furthermore, baicalein significantly inhibited the body weight loss, the replication of the virus, and relieved the lesions of lung tissue in hACE2 transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. In LPS-induced acute lung injury of mice, baicalein improved the respiratory function, inhibited inflammatory cell infiltration in the lung, and decreased the levels of IL-1β and TNF-α in serum. In conclusion, oral administration of crystal form β of baicalein could reach its effective concentration against SARS-CoV-2.

682753,State of Fragility Fractures Management during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-10-22,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Asymptomatic meningiomas are found in 1–2% of cranial MRIs. Most of them demonstrate no or minimal growth and are observed with follow-up imaging. However, the patients face a diagnosis of a brain tumor. So far, there is no established distress screening for such patients. In this study, we evaluated the psychological burden of patients with small asymptomatic meningiomas and compared it with patients after complete meningioma resection and excellent postoperative outcome. We found a high prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms in both study groups. This demonstrates that even patients with benign asymptomatic intracranial tumors might be under significant distress and need psychooncological support. ABSTRACT: The diagnosis of intracranial meningiomas as incidental findings is increasing by growing availability of MRI diagnostics. However, the psychological distress of patients with incidental meningiomas under a wait-and-watch strategy is unknown. Therefore, we aimed to compare the psychosocial situation of meningioma patients under wait-and-watch to patients after complete resection to bridge this gap. The inclusion criteria for the prospective monocenter study were either an incidental meningioma under a wait-and-watch strategy or no neurologic deficits after complete resection. Sociodemographic, clinical, and health-related quality of life and clinical data were assessed. Psychosocial factors were measured by the Distress Thermometer (DT), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), and the Short Form (SF-36). A total of 62 patients were included (n = 51 female, mean age 61 (SD 13) years). According to HADS, the prevalence of anxiety was 45% in the postoperative and 42% in the wait-and-watch group (p = 0.60), and depression was 61% and 87%, respectively (p = 0.005). In total, 43% of patients under wait-and-watch and 37% of patients in the postoperative group scored ≥6 on the DT scale. SF-36 scores were similar in all categories except general health (p = 0.005) and physical component aggregate score (43.7 (13.6) vs. 50.5 (9.5), (p = 0.03), both lower in the wait-and-watch group. Multivariate analysis revealed the wait-and-watch strategy was associated with a 4.26-fold higher risk of a pathological depression score based on HADS (p = 0.03). This study demonstrates a high prevalence of psychological distress in meningioma patients. Further evaluation is necessary to identify the patients in need of psychooncological support.","Kalasauskas, Darius; Keric, Naureen; Abu Ajaj, Salman; von Cube, Leoni; Ringel, Florian; Renovanz, Mirjam",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33255551/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12123503,426

Controversy exists on the vulnerability of thoracic cancer patients. We describe the characteristics and sequelae of patients with thoracic cancer treated at a UK cancer centre infected with COVID-19. METHODS: Patients undergoing care for thoracic cancer diagnosed with COVID-19 (RT-PCR/radiology/clinically) between March-June 2020 were included. Data were extracted from patient records. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were included: 14 (43%) diagnosed by RT-PCR, 18 (57%) by radiology and/or convincing symptoms. 88% had advanced thoracic malignancies. Eleven of 14 (79%) patients diagnosed by RT-PCR and 12 of 18 (56%) patients diagnosed by radiology/clinically were hospitalised, of which four (29%) and 2 (11%) patients required high-dependency/intensive care respectively. Three (21%) patients diagnosed by RT-PCR and 2 (11%) patients diagnosed by radiology/clinically required non-invasive ventilation; none were intubated. Complications included pneumonia and sepsis (43% and 14% respectively in patients diagnosed by RT-PCR; 17% and 11% respectively in patients diagnosed by radiology/clinically). In patients receiving active cancer treatment, therapy was delayed/ceased in 10/12 (83%) and 7/11 (64%) patients diagnosed by RT-PCR and radiology/clinically respectively. Nine (28%) patients died; all were smokers. Median time from symptom onset to death was 7 days (range 3-37). CONCLUSIONS: The immediate morbidity from COVID-19 is high in thoracic cancer patients.

One of the obstacles for the antiviral development is the requirement of biocontainment because infectious SARS-CoV-2 must be handled in a biosafety level-3 laboratory. Replicon, a non-infectious self-replicative viral RNA, could be a safe and effective tool for antiviral evaluation. Herein, we generated a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 replicon. Eight fragments covering the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome except S, E, and M genes were amplified with HiBiT-tag sequence by PCR. The amplicons were ligated and in vitro transcribed to RNA. The cells electroporated with the replicon RNA showed more than 3000 times higher luminescence than MOCK control cells at 24 h post-electroporation, indicating robust translation and RNA replication of the replicon. The replication was drastically inhibited by remdesivir, an RNA polymerase inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2. The IC(50) of remdesivir in this study was 0.29 μM, generally consistent to the IC(50) obtained using infectious SARS-CoV-2 in a previous study (0.77 μM). Taken together, this system could be applied to the safe and effective antiviral evaluation without using infectious SARS-CoV-2. Because this is a PCR-based and transient replicon system, further improvement including the establishment of stable cell line must be achieved.","Kotaki, Tomohiro; Xie, Xuping; Shi, Pei-Yong; Kameoka, Masanori",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33500537/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-82055-0,426

At present, certain vaccines and few drugs are used to control the virus during seasonal outbreaks. However, high mutation rates and genetic reassortment make it challenging to prevent and mitigate outbreaks, leading to pandemics. Thus, alternate therapies are required for its management and control. Here, we report that a bacterial protein, azurin, and its peptide derivatives p18 and p28 target critical proteins of the influenza virus in an effective manner. The molecular docking studies show that the p28 peptide could target C-PB1, NS1-ED, PB2-CBD, PB2-RBD, NP, and PA proteins. These complexes were further subjected to the simulation of molecular dynamics and binding free energy calculations. The data indicate that p28 has an unusually high affinity and forms stable complexes with the viral proteins C-PB1, PB2-CBD, PB2-RBD, and NP. We suggest that the azurin derivative p28 peptide can act as an anti-influenza agent as it can bind to multiple targets and neutralize the virus. Additional experimental studies need to be conducted to evaluate its safety and efficacy as an anti-H1N1 molecule.

684820,Identifying Missed Opportunities for Routine Vaccination among People Who Use Drugs,2021-02-04,"Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to immense challenges for healthcare systems worldwide. People with cystic fibrosis (CF) were included in the clinically extremely vulnerable group for complications of coronavirus by the UK government and advised to shield during a national lockdown. Data suggests that pandemic-related restrictions have been linked to a reduction in pulmonary exacerbation events (PEx). We sought to explore whether an increase in medicine possession ratio and potentially adherence may be a factor in this finding. Methods: 50 patients who received medication through a homecare delivery system at a single large adult centre were randomly selected. Data from 12 months ‘pre-lockdown’ was compared to data for 9 months following start of shielding in March 2020. MPR was calculated and capped at 100%. Medications that were started or stopped during the pandemic were not included. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare pre- and post-values. Results: 91 prescription medications were valid for analysis (45 nebulised antibiotics, 34 mucolytics and 12 CFTR modulators). MPR increased for 41 prescriptions (45.1%), decreased for 21 medications (23.1%) and remained unchanged for 29 medications (31.9%). Median MPR increased from 83% [57–100%] to 89% [66–100%], p = 0.037. MPR for nebulised antibiotics significantly increased (median 75% [54–100%] vs 89% [61–100%], p = 0.027). Median MPR for CFTR modulators was 100% throughout and did not change for mucolytics (75% [42–100%] vs 78% [53–100%], p = 0.419). Conclusion: We report a significant change in medication possession in adults with CF during the coronavirus pandemic in the UK. It is unclear whether this change translated to an increase in adherence but may be one factor in the reported decrease in PEx events described during this time. It is notable that increases were largely driven by inhaled antibiotics and this may represent a concerted effort to achieve maximal protection from infection.","Iqbal, N.; Nadat, Z.; Vessey, J.

The reported incidence of thrombosis in patients with COVID‐19 varies considerably depending on anticoagulant regimen, severity of disease and additional risk factors such as central lines. The most commonly used in‐hospital anticoagulants, unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), require antithrombin (AT) to exert their anticoagulant effect (Bussey and Francis 2004). Therefore, AT deficiency can result in failure achieve adequate anticoagulation with UFH or LMWH at usual doses.","Arachchillage, Deepa J; Remmington, Christopher; Rosenberg, Alex; Xu, Tina; Passariello, Maurizio; Hall, Donna; Laffan, A Mike; Patel, Brijesh V",Br J Haematol,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.16927; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32516429/,426

The quantitative aspect of E-survey was administered through Google forms sent via E-mail, and structured telephonic interview was conducted as a qualitative aspect on randomly selected 10 students based on predecided interview questions. This study was reported as per the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys. The analysis was performed using percentages and paired t-test with significance at P < 0.05, Chi-square test with Yate's correction. Qualitative responses were analyzed using coding and categorization. RESULTS: The response rate was 88%. Time spent on social media for >4 h increased from 1.1% to 47.72% during lockdown. Forty three (48.86%) of the students reported increased mood fluctuations. The relation between mood fluctuations and time spent on social media of >4 h was significant χ(2)= 6.41 with P < 0.05. Average hours of sleep after using social media before lockdown increased significantly from 6.68 h to 8.10 h during lockdown using paired t-test, where “t” was 6.84. There was a positive impact on communication with friends and family. CONCLUSION: Due to the increased extent of use of social media during lockdown, negative mind-body effects have surfaced but emerged as boon in terms of communication.","Gupta, Ankit; Jagzape, Arunita; Kumar, Mahendra",J Educ Health Promot,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34084802/; https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_749_20,426

A Questionnaire Survey,2020-05-28,"The current study aimed to explore mental health problems in patients diagnosed with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cluster sampling, cross-sectional survey with 6213 cancer patients was conducted in one of the largest cancer centers in China. The socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, psychosomatic conditions, interpersonal relationships and social support, COVID-19 infection-related psychological stress, and mental health status were measured. Medical conditions were extracted from patients’ electronic healthcare records. Among the 6213 cancer patients, 23.4% had depression, 17.7% had anxiety, 9.3% had PTSD, and 13.5% had hostility. Hierarchical liner regression models showed that having a history of mental disorder, excessive alcohol consumption, having a higher frequency of worrying about cancer management due to COVID-19, having a higher frequency feeling of overwhelming psychological pressure from COVID-19, and having a higher level of fatigue and pain were the predominant risk factors for mental health problems in cancer patients. However, there were only 1.6% of them were seeking psychological counseling during COVID-19. We also revealed the protective factors associated with lower risk of mental health problems among cancer patients. The present study revealed a high prevalence of mental health problems and gaps in mental health services for cancer patients, which also indicated high distress from COVID-19-elevated risks. We call for systematic screening of mental health status for all cancer patients, and developing specific psychological interventions for this vulnerable population.","Wang, Yuanyuan; Duan, Zhizhou; Ma, Zikun; Mao, Yize; Li, Xiyuan; Wilson, Amanda; Qin, Huiying; Ou, Jianjun; Peng, Ke; Zhou, Fangjian; Li, Chaofeng; Liu, Zhuowei; Chen, Runsen",Transl Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32737292/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-00950-y,426

At the peak of confirmed COVID‐19 cases during the first wave in Switzerland (March–April 2020), we conducted a survey in the German‐speaking part of the country (N = 1,585). The results suggest that the implemented measures are accepted. The survey participants are more concerned that other family members could catch the virus compared with themselves, and they are worried about its economic impact. The results suggest that how trust is measured is crucial because general trust and social trust have opposite effects on the participants’ risk perceptions. People with high general trust perceive less risks associated with COVID‐19 compared with people who have low general trust, and people with high social trust perceive more risks compared with people who have low social trust. The results further indicate that perceived risks are important drivers for the acceptance of the government's implemented measures to control COVID‐19 and for more precautionary behavior (i.e., contact with fewer people and more hygienic behavior). Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.","Siegrist, Michael; Luchsinger, Larissa; Bearth, Angela",Risk Anal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33438218/; https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.13675,426
686453,Increase in Video Consultations During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Healthcare Professionals’ Perceptions about Their Implementation and Adequate Management,2020-07-15,"Purpose The COVID pandemic was a severe blow to all workers, but it may ultimately have a silver lining for some workers with disabilities if it makes work from home easier and more acceptable. In addition, the pandemic is shaking up traditional workplace structures and causing employers to rethink how essential tasks can be done, which may broaden their views of workplace accommodations. We assess the potential for the pandemic to improve employment opportunities for people with disabilities. Methods This article analyzes pre-COVID data on disability and home-based work from three representative data sources—the American Community Survey, American Time Use Survey, and Current Population Survey. We employ both cross-tabulations and regressions to predict work at home. Results We find that workers with disabilities are more likely than those without disabilities both to work primarily from home and to do any work at home. This is true for both employees and self-employed workers. Workers with disabilities face similar wage gaps in on-site and home-based work, indicating that while increased availability of home-based work may create more employment opportunities for workers with disabilities, it is unlikely to erase wage disparities. While workers with disabilities are currently more likely to be working primarily from home, only 34% are in occupations with high potential for home-based work, compared to 40% of workers without disabilities. Conclusions Workers with disabilities are currently more likely to work from home and many may benefit from expanded work-at-home opportunities, but the types of jobs they hold constrain this potential. Research is needed to see how home-based work evolves as the economy recovers from the pandemic over the next several years.","Schur, Lisa A.; Ameri, Mason; Kruse, Douglas",J Occup Rehabil,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33156435/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10926-020-09936-5,426

This study described the clinical characteristics and management of COVID-19 patients treated in psychiatric inpatient settings due to comorbid first-onset mental disorders in Wuhan, China. This electronic medical records-based study included 25 COVID-19 patients with first-onset mental disorders and 55 patients with first-onset mental disorders without COVID-19 (control group). Data collected included ICD-10 diagnoses of mental disorders, psychiatric and respiratory symptoms, treatments, and outcomes. Adjustment disorder (n = 11, 44.0%) and acute and transient psychotic disorders, with associated acute stress (n = 6, 24.0%) were main clinical diagnoses in the COVID-19 group while serious mental illnesses (i.e., schizophrenia, 24.5%) and alcohol use disorders (10.9%) were overrepresented in the control group. On admission, the most common psychiatric symptom in COVID-19 patients was insomnia symptoms (n = 18, 72.0%), followed by aggressive behaviors (n = 16, 64.0%), delusion (n = 10, 40.0%), and severe anxiety (n = 9, 36.0%). In addition to respiratory treatments, 76.0% COVID-19 patients received antipsychotics, 40.0% sedative-hypnotics, and 24.0% mood stabilizers. At the end of inpatient treatment, 4 (16.0%) COVID-19 patients were transferred to other hospitals to continue respiratory treatment after their psychiatric symptoms were controlled while the remaining 21 (84.0%) all recovered. Compared to the control group, COVID-19 group had significantly shorter length of hospital stay (21.2 vs. 37.4 days, P < 0.001). Adjustment disorder and acute and transient psychotic disorders are the main clinical diagnoses of COVID-19 patients managed in psychiatric inpatient settings.

687075,The Prediction of Infectious Diseases: A Bibliometric Analysis,2020-08-27,"Sepsis is a dysregulated systemic response to infection, and no effective treatment options are available. Acacetin is a natural flavonoid found in various plants, including Sparganii rhizoma, Sargentodoxa cuneata and Patrinia scabiosifolia. Studies have revealed that acacetin potentially exerts anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects on sepsis. In this study, we investigated the potential protective effect of acacetin on sepsis and revealed the underlying mechanisms using a network pharmacology approach coupled with experimental validation and molecular docking. First, we found that acacetin significantly suppressed pathological damage and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in mice with LPS-induced fulminant hepatic failure and acute lung injury, and in vitro experiments further confirmed that acacetin attenuated LPS-induced M1 polarization. Then, network pharmacology screening revealed EGFR, PTGS2, SRC and ESR1 as the top four overlapping targets in a PPI network, and GO and KEGG analyses revealed the top 20 enriched biological processes and signalling pathways associated with the therapeutic effects of acacetin on sepsis. Further network pharmacological analysis indicated that gap junctions may be highly involved in the protective effects of acacetin on sepsis. Finally, molecular docking verified that acacetin bound to the active sites of the four targets predicted by network pharmacology, and in vitro experiments further confirmed that acacetin significantly inhibited the upregulation of p-src induced by LPS and attenuated LPS-induced M1 polarization through gap junctions. Taken together, our results indicate that acacetin may protect against sepsis via a mechanism involving multiple targets and pathways and that gap junctions may be highly involved in this process.","Ouyang, Yuanshuo; Rong, Yi; Wang, Yanming; Guo, Yanli; Shan, Liya; Yu, Xiushi; Li, Li; Si, Junqiang; Li, Xinzhi; Ma, Ketao",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34483900/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.683645,426

However, many infectious pathogens often result in very similar clinical presentations, complicating the test-order for physicians who have to narrow down the causative agent prior to in-house PCR testing. As a consequence, the intuitive response is to start empirical therapy to treat a broad spectrum of possible pathogens. Syndromic molecular testing has been increasingly integrated into routine clinical care, either to provide diagnostic, epidemiological or patient management information. These multiplex panels can be used to screen for predefined infectious disease pathogens simultaneously within a 1 h timeframe, creating opportunities for rapid diagnostics. Conversely, syndromic panels have their own challenges and must be adaptable to the evolving demands of the clinical setting. Firstly, questions have been raised regarding the clinical relevance of some of the targets included in the panels and secondly, there is the added expense of integration into the clinical laboratory. Here, we aim to discuss some of the factors that should be considered before performing syndromic testing rather than traditional low-plex in-house PCR.","Cassidy, Hayley; Van Genne, Mart; Lizarazo-Forero, Erley; Gard, Lilli; Niesters, Hubert G M",J Antimicrob Chemother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34555161/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/dkab243,426

We examined whether polymorphisms of IFN-γ,TNF-α and IL-10 affect the susceptibility to and outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS: A case-control study was carried out in 476 Chinese SARS patients and 449 healthy controls. We tested the polymorphisms of IFN-γ,TNF-α and IL-10 for their associations with SARS. RESULTS: IFN-γ +874A allele was associated with susceptibility to SARS in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.001). Individuals with IFN-γ +874 AA and AT genotype had a 5.19-fold (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 2.78-9.68) and 2.57-fold (95% CI, 1.35-4.88) increased risk of developing SARS respectively.

688075,Statistical and Network-Based Analysis of Italian COVID-19 Data: Communities Detection and Temporal Evolution,2020-06-12,"OBJECTIVE: Stress-induced hyperglycemia is associated with poor outcomes in nearly all critical illnesses. This acute elevation in glucose after injury or illness is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, including multiple organ failure. Stress-induced hyperglycemia is often attributed to insulin resistance as controlling glucose levels via exogenous insulin improves outcomes, but the mechanisms are unclear. Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors are direct targets of insulin signaling in the liver that regulate glucose homeostasis via direct and indirect pathways. Loss of hepatic FOXO transcription factors reduces hyperglycemia in chronic insulin resistance; however, the role of FOXOs in stress-induced hyperglycemia is unknown. METHODS: We subjected mice lacking FOXO transcription factors in the liver to a model of injury known to cause stress-induced hyperglycemia. Glucose, insulin, glycerol, fatty acids, cytokines, and adipokines were assessed before and after injury. Liver and adipose tissue were analyzed for changes in glycogen, FOXO target gene expression, and insulin signaling. RESULTS: Stress-induced hyperglycemia was associated with reduced hepatic insulin signaling and increased hepatic FOXO target gene expression while loss of FOXO1, 3, and 4 in the liver attenuated hyperglycemia and prevented hyperinsulinemia. Mechanistically, the loss of FOXO transcription factors mitigated the stress-induced hyperglycemia response by directly altering gene expression and glycogenolysis in the liver and indirectly suppressing lipolysis in adipose tissue. Reductions were associated with decreased IL-6, TNF-α, and follistatin and increased FGF21, suggesting that cytokines and FOXO-regulated hepatokines contribute to the stress-induced hyperglycemia response. CONCLUSIONS: This study implicates FOXO transcription factors as a predominant driver of stress-induced hyperglycemia through means that include cross-talk between the liver and adipose, highlighting a novel mechanism underlying acute hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in stress.","Garcia Whitlock, Anna E.; Sostre-Colón, Jamarie; Gavin, Matthew; Martin, Niels D.; Baur, Joseph A.; Sims, Carrie A.; Titchenell, Paul M.",Mol Metab,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33964506/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmet.2021.101246,426

In the course of universal admission screening with the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay at our institution, we observed that 3.9 % (44/1123) of SARS-CoV-2 positive results were negative for the envelope (E) gene target but positive for the nucleocapsid (N2) target. The overall SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate during the three-month study period was 15.4 % (1123/7285), spanning April-June 2020. The majority of patients with E-negative, N2-positive results were asymptomatic, with 29.5 % of patients symptomatic for COVID-19 at the time of presentation. Asymptomatic patients with E-negative, N2-positive results were significantly younger than symptomatic patients with the same results (average 37.6 vs. 58.4, p = 0.003). Similar proportions of prior SARS-CoV-2 positivity were noted among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (38.5 % vs. 33.3 %, p = 0.82). Among the 16 asymptomatic patients with radiographic imaging performed, four (25 %) had chest radiographic findings concerning for viral pneumonia. Interestingly, we observed an E-negative, N2-positive result in one patient with a previous SARS-CoV-2 by the Xpert Xpress that occurred 71 days prior. Critically, E-negative, N2-positive results were observed in 8 symptomatic patients with a new diagnosis of COVID-19. Thus, though concerns remain about extended SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity in some patients, the ability of clinical laboratories to detect patients with high Ct values (including E-negative, N2-positive results) is vital for retaining maximal sensitivity for diagnostic purposes. Our data show that a finding of E-positive, N2-negative SARS-CoV-2 should not be used to rule out the presence of subclinical infection.","Khoshchehreh, Mahdi; Wald-Dickler, Noah; Holtom, Paul; Butler-Wu, Susan M.",J Clin Virol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104683; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665322030425X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665322030425X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33142250/,426

Studies have shown that media news about public crisis events have a significant impact on individuals' depression. However, how and when the duration of attention to pandemic news predicts depression still remains an open question. This study established a moderated mediating model to investigate the relationship between the duration of attention to pandemic news and depression, the mediating effect of risk perception, and the moderating effect of future time perspective on the relationship. In early February 2020, 701 individuals from 29 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities across China were asked to self-report their duration of attention to pandemic news, level of depression, risk perception, and future time perspective during the COVID-19 outbreak. Results show that there is a significant positive correlation between the duration of attention to news on COVID-19 and depression; risk perception mediates the association between the duration of attention to pandemic news and depression; and future time perspective plays a moderating role between risk perception and depression. The findings of the present study provide theoretical implications and practically throw some light on alleviating the public's depression during pandemic periods. We highlight that the individual's hope for a better future, focusing on positive news, and time perspective balance during an epidemic disease are also beneficial to promoting positive emotion and reducing depression.","Wu, Lanting; Li, Xiaobao; Lyu, Hochao",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33643120/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.564284,426

Due to their phylogenetic distance, mechanisms of immune diversification and the way in which they deposit IgY immunoglobulin in the egg yolk, chickens provide a number of advantages compared to mammals as hosts for immunization. These advantages include: the one-step purification of antibodies from egg yolk in large amounts facilitates having a virtually continuous supply; the epitope spectrum of avian antibodies potentially grants access to novel specificities; the broad absence of cross-reactivity with mammalian epitopes avoids assay interference and improves the performance of immunological techniques. The polyclonal nature of IgY antibodies has limited their use since avian hybridoma techniques are not well established. Recombinant IgY, however, can be generated from mammalian monoclonal antibodies which makes it possible to further exploit the advantageous properties of the IgY scaffold. Moreover, cloning and selecting the immune repertoire from avian organisms is highly efficient, yielding antigen-specific antibody fragments. The recombinant approach is well suited to circumvent any limitations of polyclonal antibodies.

This is primarily attributed to the exaggerated immune response (inflammatory disease), which may prove detrimental to the host, as evidenced by SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. From the experiences of Novel Coronavirus Disease‐19 to date, male patients are likely to suffer from high‐intensity inflammation and disease severity than the female population. Hormones are considered the significant pillars of sex differences responsible for the discrepancy in immune response exhibited by males and females. Females appear to be better equipped to counter invading respiratory viral pathogens, including the novel SARS‐CoV‐2, than males.
