94895,Influential factors for insomnia in medical staff in the national medical aid team for Hubei Province during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019.,2020-06-28,"BACKGROUND Challenging workplace situations such as bullying, harassment, depression, suicide and fatigue exist in health care. The performing arts can generate dialogue and engagement with these difficult issues. This study evaluates a workshop for health care students that used filmed vignettes from a verbatim theatre play that used real stories of such situations. The workshop aimed to improve health professional students' confidence in seeking help for depression, addressing mistreatment, understanding mandatory reporting laws and the impact of driver fatigue. METHODS Two workshops were held: one with a mixture of professions, including nursing, medical and allied health students, and the other with medical students only. Participants completed questionnaires before and after each workshop, responding to four Likert questions on understanding and confidence about the issues discussed and free-text responses about the perceived value of the workshop. RESULTS Sixty-five people took part in the workshops, with a 100% response rate to the pre-workshop survey and a 98% response rate (n = 64) to the post workshop survey. Students most frequently reported an improvement in understanding mandatory reporting laws (57%), followed by an increase in confidence in dealing with bullying and harassment (44%). Students in the workshop with a mix of professions noted the benefit of learning about these challenging issues alongside students from other health professions. DISCUSSION Students valued the facilitated discussion of sensitive issues. Although many respondents increased their understanding or confidence in the four topics, a smaller proportion reported a reduction after the workshop. Perhaps this resulted from greater appreciation of the complexities of these issues. Health care students valued hearing from other professional groups in the mixed professions workshop.","Nash, Louise; Scott, Karen; Pit, Sabrina; Barnes, Elizabeth; Ivory, Kimberley; Hooker, Claire",The clinical teacher,https://doi.org/10.1111/tct.13229; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767630/,907
105729,[The Management of Blood Glucose Should be Emphasized in the Treatment of COVID-19].,2020-03-01,"Implicated in numerous human diseases, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are dynamic ensembles of interconverting conformers that often contain many proline residues. Whether and how proline conformation regulates the functional aspects of IDPs remains an open question, however. Here, we studied the disordered domain 2 of nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A-D2) of hepatitis C virus (HCV). NS5A-D2 comprises a short structural motif (PW-turn) embedded in a proline-rich sequence, whose interaction with the human prolyl isomerase cyclophilin A (CypA) is essential for viral RNA replication. Using NMR, we show here that the PW-turn motif exists in a conformational equilibrium between folded and disordered states. We found that the fraction of conformers in the NS5A-D2 ensemble that adopt the structured motif is allosterically modulated both by the cis/trans isomerization of the surrounding prolines that are CypA substrates and by substitutions conferring resistance to cyclophilin inhibitor. Moreover, we noted that this fraction is directly correlated with HCV RNA replication efficiency. We conclude that CypA can fine-tune the dynamic ensemble of the disordered NS5A-D2, thereby regulating viral RNA replication efficiency.","Dujardin, Marie; Madan, Vanesa; Gandhi, Neha S; Cantrelle, François-Xavier; Launay, Hélène; Huvent, Isabelle; Bartenschlager, Ralf; Lippens, Guy; Hanoulle, Xavier",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra119.009537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315928/,907

We herein present a 58-year old woman with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia who developed lethal haemothorax after a thoracoscopic lung biopsy with the use of an endostapler preloaded with bioabsorbable tissue reinforcement material. This lethal haemothorax, which occurred on the day after the lung biopsy, required an emergency operation. The bleeding point was an intercostal artery of the inferior chest wall adjacent to the surgical stump. The operative findings suggested that the reinforced material on the surgical stump scratched the chest wall through respiratory movement.","Kanai, Yoshihiko; Endo, Shunsuke; Tetsuka, Kenji; Yamamoto, Shinichi",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/icvts/ivr118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22184467/,907
114250,[Application of laboratory diagnostic technologies for SARS-CoV-2: current progress and prospect].,2020-04-30,"PURPOSE To describe the use of cerebral oximetry to detect a lack of right cerebral perfusion resulting from a malpositioned catheter used for antegrade cerebral perfusion during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA). The simple corrective surgical adjustment that followed averted a potentially serious complication. CLINICAL FEATURES A 57-yr-old male with a type-A aortic dissection undergoing DHCA required antegrade cerebral perfusion for cerebral protection. Catheters were placed accordingly in the left common carotid and brachiocephalic arteries. Whereas frontal cerebral oximetry immediately improved on the left, it did not improve on the right. It was immediately suspected that the tip of the brachiocephalic cannula had advanced into the right subclavian artery, thus depriving the right common carotid artery of blood flow. The problem resolved upon slight withdrawal of the cannula. CONCLUSION Vigilance in anesthesia should not stop during DHCA or cardiopulmonary bypass. Cerebral oximetry may provide important information leading to actions that improve brain protection. Vigilances proved important in this case where the cannula tip used for antegrade cerebral perfusion was advanced too far into the right subclavian artery.","Chan, Simon K C; Underwood, Malcolm J; Ho, Anthony M-H; So, Jack M; Ho, Adrienne K; Wan, Innes Y P; Wong, Randolph H L",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-014-0181-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24866375/,907

Combined surgery may represent an alternative to sequential procedures and it allow the treatment, at the same time, of coexisting lesions; in this perspective, full-robotic multiorgan surgery is starting to gain interest from surgeons worldwide. METHODS Between April and June 2019, two patients presenting with synchronous colorectal and kidney cancers underwent respectively full-robotic right colectomy with right partial nephrectomy and anterior rectal resection with left partial nephrectomy. Surgeries were performed by both the general surgery and urology team. RESULTS No intraoperative complications were registered and postoperative course was uneventful in both cases. CONCLUSIONS Combined multiple organ surgery with full robotic technique is safe and offers oncological adequate results. A multiteam surgical pre-planning is mandatory to reduce invasiveness and operative time. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first reports of full robotic partial nephrectomy combined with colorectal procedures.","Piccoli, Micaela; Pecchini, Francesca; Esposito, Sofia; Sighinolfi, Chiara; Gozzo, Davide; Trapani, Vincenzo; De Carne, Cosimo; Rocco, Bernardo",The international journal of medical robotics + computer assisted surgery : MRCAS,https://doi.org/10.1002/rcs.2131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32462765/,907

Although general operative principles of SILS are similar to conventional laparoscopic surgery, operative techniques are not standardized. This review aims to evaluate the current use of SILS published in the literature by examining the types of operations performed, techniques employed, and relevant complications and morbidity. This review considered a total of 94 studies reporting 1889 patients evaluating 17 different general surgical operations. There were 8 different access techniques reported using conventional laparoscopic instruments and specifically designed SILS ports. There is extensive heterogeneity associated with operating methods and in particular ways of overcoming problems with retraction and instrumentation. Published complications, morbidity, and hospital length of stay are comparable to conventional laparoscopy. Although SILS provides excellent cosmetic results and morbidity seems similar to conventional laparoscopy, larger randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of this novel technique.","Froghi, Farid; Sodergren, Mikael Hans; Darzi, Ara; Paraskeva, Paraskevas","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e3181ed86c6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20729685/,907
160737,A brief introduction of Xiangya's anti-epidemic history in a century.,2020-05-28,"BACKGROUND Idiopathic clubfoot treatment is treated by manipulation and casting utilizing the Ponseti technique which can make the infant fussy and irritable. The goal of this study was to determine which intervention could decrease this pain response in infants undergoing Ponseti casting for idiopathic clubfeet. Our hypothesis was that the administration of oral sucrose solution or milk would be the most effective in accomplishing that goal. METHODS We conducted a double-blinded randomized controlled trial at a tertiary pediatric orthopaedic center on 33 children (average age=17.94 d; SD=20.51 d) undergoing clubfoot manipulation and casting and their guardians. Each cast was considered a new event and was randomized to an oral 20% sucrose solution (S), water (W), or milk (M) in a bottle (breast or nonbreast). We assessed the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), heart rate, and oxygen saturation before, during, and after the casting. RESULTS A total of 131 casts were randomized and 118 analyzed (37 M, 42 S, 39 W). Each child underwent an average of 3.97 casts (SD=1.74). There were no significant differences seen between the groups before casting in their mean NIPS score (M=2.2; SD=2.38, S=1.84, SD=2.18, W=1.61, SD=2.12). However during casting, mean NIPS score for both milk, 0.91 (SD=1.26, P=0.0005) and sucrose, 0.64 (SD=1.27, P<0.0001) were significantly less than water, 2.27 (SD=2.03) but not different from each other (P=0.33). Postcasting, the sucrose NIPS score, 0.69 (SD=1.53) continued to be significantly less than milk, 2.11 (SD=2.37, P=0.0065. There was no correlation between heart rate or oxygen saturation and NIPS. CONCLUSIONS Sucrose solution and milk during Ponseti casting and manipulation were effective in decreasing the pain response in children undergoing manipulation and casting for clubfeet. The sucrose solution administration continued the pain relief into the postcasting period. In addition to the benefits of improving the patient experience during casting, a less irritable child may result in better casting.

184702,[Histone acetylation modulates influenza virus replicative intermediate dsRNA-induced interleukin-6 expression in A549 cells].,2013,"Artificial intelligence (AI) tools allow to extract knowledge from big data and are increasingly used for research purposes applied to -omics, diagnostic images, complex patterns of diseases and system medicine, drug development, robotics, and other topics. The management of big data, largely made of individual clinical data, poses specific ethical challenges that must be addressed in research studies and that should be reflected in the informed consent process. Explaining the mechanisms used by AI algorithms in supporting clinical decision making may be particularly difficult because of the opacity of its process. Moreover, depending on the quality of data feeding their algorithms, AI applications may result in errors. As the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) includes the possibility that a patient withdraws his/her informed consent from a study, it may be challenging to update AI algorithms accordingly. On the other hand, AI tools may help support the recruitment and retention of participants in clinical trials matching eligibility criteria with individual data collected for clinical purposes in electronic health records, and improve data collection and analytics. The possibility to stream data from wearable devices offers the possibility to generate large data volumes relevant to Patient Reported Outcomes feeding AI predictive algorithms. The Covid-19 pandemic has promoted the application of digital tools and of AI in clinical trials in order to limit personal contacts. The pressure exerted by the pandemic will possibly speed up the adoption of AI solutions for clinical trials and will highlight their potential ethical implications. © 2021","Tozzi, A.

188558,"[Antigenicity analysis of nucleocapsid proteins of 3 human coronaviruses SARS-CoV, 229E and OC43 with their monoclonal antibodies].",2006,"Vaccine hesitancy is growing worldwide and hampering efforts to control vaccine-preventable diseases. Healthcare professionals have a critical role in the acceptance of vaccination by patients. Increased awareness about the benefits of vaccination is one of the recommended strategy to counter vaccine hesitancy. Beyond protection of individuals against specific pathogens, vaccination have broad benefits at multiple levels of society, partly mediated by community protection. These benefits include improved access to education, increased productivity and positive fiscal impact, limitation of gender inequalities, control and prevention of antibiotic resistant pathogens. In this narrative review, those benefits are summarized and relevant studies reviewed. The broad benefits of immunization should contribute to better communication about the impact of immunization and could be part of educational programs of future health-care workers. The COVID-19 pandemic has a tremendous socio-economic impact and is the illustration of a world without vaccine. Nevertheless, recent surveys indicate that the acceptance of a future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine will not be universal, illustrating the importance of communication centered on safety and tolerability of future vaccines.","Dauby, N",Revue medicale de Liege,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33211442/,907
188962,[Development of a SPA-ELISA method for detecting anti-coronavirus IgG antibodies in serum samples from fulvous fruit bats].,2008,"Kawasaki disease (KD) and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) are inflammatory conditions that present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges to the physician. Although many of their features overlap, they are two distinct conditions. KD is a febrile illness most commonly affecting children younger than five years. It manifests with prolonged fever and at least four of the following features: bilateral bulbar conjunctivitis, mucositis, diffuse maculopapular rash, extremity changes, and cervical lymphadenopathy of 1.5 cm or more in diameter. Patients with MIS-C may have many of the same manifestations but tend to have higher rates of gastrointestinal and neurocognitive symptoms and signs of shock on presentation. Both conditions are associated with cardiac sequelae, including coronary artery aneurysms, although children with MIS-C are at high risk of developing ventricular dysfunction and depressed cardiac output. Lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated troponin, and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide are key laboratory findings of MIS-C that can help distinguish it from KD. The use of intravenous immune globulin is well established in KD and also appears to have a role in the treatment of MIS-C. Aspirin has been used in KD for an anti-inflammatory effect, and low-dose aspirin is recommended for MIS-C to reduce the risk of thrombosis. In addition to supportive care, patients with MIS-C may benefit from immunomodulatory medications, although data on this topic are evolving.","Darby, John B; Jackson, Jennifer M",American family physician,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34523885/,907
195035,[Variability analysis of S2 gene of SARS-CoV].,2006,"BACKGROUND Despite a substantial association between professional burnout and depression, the exact nature of the relationship is unclear. It is hypothesized that an underlying susceptibility for depression is associated with an enhanced risk for professional burnout. In the present study, the relationship was examined between indices of personal and familial history of depression and current symptoms of burnout. METHODS Respondents were 3385 employees of different work settings (61% female, age 18-65 years), who completed questionnaires regarding demographic variables, working hours, personal and familial history of depression, current depressive symptomatology, and current symptoms of professional burnout. RESULTS After controlling for background variables, the strongest predictor of all three burnout facets was current depressive symptomatology. Independent of the effects of background variables and current depressive symptoms, having ever experienced a depressive episode further predicted current symptoms of two burnout facets: emotional exhaustion (OR=1.82, 95% CI=1.38-2.40, P<0.001) and cynicism (OR=1.51, 95% CI=1.16-1.98, P=0.002). In addition, a history of depression in close family members independently predicted current symptoms of emotional exhaustion (OR=1.63, 95% CI=1.27-2.10, P<0.001), while a trend appeared for a similar effect on cynicism (OR=1.23, 95% CI=0.96-1.58, P=0.095). LIMITATIONS The study is based on a cross-sectional retrospective design. CONCLUSIONS A predisposition for depression, as reflected by a personal and familial history of depression, may enhance the risk for burnout.","Nyklícek, I; Pop, V J",Journal of affective disorders,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16054229/,907

448194,[Dandelion clock-like sign on CT for diagnose of COVID-19],2020,"COVID-19 is associated with a high incidence of thrombotic complications, which can be explained by the complex and unique interplay between coronaviruses and endothelial cells, the local and systemic inflammatory response, and the coagulation system. Empirically, an intensified dose of thrombosis prophylaxis is being used in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and several guidelines on this topic have been published, although the insufficiency of high quality and direct evidence has led to weak recommendations. In this Viewpoint we summarise the pathophysiology of COVID-19 coagulopathy in the context of patients who are ambulant, admitted to hospital, and critically ill or non-critically ill, and those post-discharge from hospital. We also review data from randomised controlled trials in the past year of antithrombotic therapy in patients who are critically ill. These data provide the first high-quality evidence on optimal use of antithrombotic therapy in patients with COVID-19. Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is not routinely recommended for patients who are ambulant and post-discharge. A first ever trial in non-critically ill patients who were admitted to hospital has shown that a therapeutic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin might improve clinical outcomes in this population. In critically ill patients, this same treatment does not improve outcomes and prophylactic dose anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis is recommended. In the upcoming months we expect numerous data from the ongoing antithrombotic COVID-19 studies to guide clinicians at different stages of the disease.","Leentjens, Jenneke; van Haaps, Thijs F; Wessels, Pieter F; Schutgens, Roger E G; Middeldorp, Saskia",Lancet Haematol,,907

Sixty-three DTA reports (56 studies) were meta-analyzed with a pooled sensitivity of 90.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 88.7%–93.1%) and specificity of 96.1% (95% CI, 94.2%–97.9%) for the detection of either influenza virus (n = 29), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n = 1), influenza virus and RSV (n = 19), or a viral panel including influenza virus and RSV (n = 14). The 15 included impact studies (5 randomized) were very heterogeneous and results were therefore inconclusive.
