The main principles are based on the results of applied studies carried out by the authors in Moscow, Kursk, Velikiy Novgorod and Simferopol in 2019-2020. The respondents were both the elderly themselves and the specialists providing them social services support. The emphasis is made on the factors of healthy lifestyle of the elderly and first of all on feasible physical activity and productive creative activity. The considerable attention was paid to internal resources of the elderly person (general condition of physical and mental health and ability to maintain it, capacity for self-care and physical activity, positive frame of mind, personal persuasion in the need to properly use the opportunities available to elderly people). The following external factors are distinguish - constructive relationship with closest relatives, development of infrastructure for leisure activities, physical exercises and sport activities, accessibility for the retired of health care institutions. Among the means of maintaining active and healthy longevity of the elderly are marked informing about possibilities of using their potentials, appropriate consultations, provision of technical means of rehabilitation, involvement into constructive activities, giving positive examples and persuasion. The importance of individual approach to each retired is emphasized, taking into account their physical capabilities, health status and chronic diseases. The types of ""activities"" are marked useful for physical and spiritual health of elderly person, available to them at home that is especially actual in conditions of self-isolation due to prevention of coronavirus infection.","Tanatova, D K; Yudina, T N; Vdovina, M V","Problemy sotsial'noi gigieny, zdravookhraneniia i istorii meditsiny",862,9

However, common face masks are single use and can cause cross-infection due to the accumulated infectious pathogens. We developed salt-based formulations to coat membrane fibers to fabricate antimicrobial filters. Here, we report a mechanistic study on salt-induced pathogen inactivation. The salt recrystallization following aerosol exposure was characterized over time on sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium sulfate (K2SO4), and potassium chloride (KCl) powders and coatings, which revealed that NaCl and KCl start to recrystallize within 5 min and K2SO4 within 15 min. The inactivation kinetics observed for the H1N1 influenza virus and Klebsiella pneumoniae matched the salt recrystallization well, which was identified as the main destabilizing mechanism. Additionally, the salt-coated filters were prepared with different methods (with and without a vacuum process), which led to salt coatings with different morphologies for diverse applications. Finally, the salt-coated filters caused a loss of pathogen viability independent of transmission mode (aerosols or droplets), against both DI water and artificial saliva suspensions. Overall, these findings increase our understanding of the salt-recrystallization-based technology to develop highly versatile antimicrobial filters.","Rubino, Ilaria; Han, Sumin; Oh, Euna; Kumaran, Surjith; Lawson, Matthew; Jung, Yu-Jin; Kim, Ki-Hye; Bhatnagar, Noopur; Lee, Su-Hwa; Kang, Hae-Ji; Lee, Dong-Hun; Chu, Ki-Back; Kang, Sang-Moo; Quan, Fu-Shi; Choi, Hyo-Jick",ACS applied materials & interfaces,862,27

Injuries are the leading cause of death in people aged 5-24 years and a leading cause of disability. In most low-income and middle-income countries where the majority of global child injury burden occurs, systems for routinely collecting injury data are limited. METHODS A new model of injury surveillance for use in emergency departments in Nepal was designed and piloted. Data from patients presenting with injuries were collected prospectively over 12 months and used to describe the epidemiology of paediatric injury presentations. RESULTS The total number of children <18 years of age presenting with injury was 2696, representing 27% of all patients presenting with injuries enrolled. Most injuries in children presenting to the emergency departments in this study were unintentional and over half of children were <10 years of age. Falls, animal bites/stings and road traffic injuries accounted for nearly 75% of all injuries with poisonings, burns and drownings presenting proportionately less often. Over half of injuries were cuts, bites and open wounds. In-hospital child mortality from injury was 1%. CONCLUSION Injuries affecting children in Nepal represent a significant burden. The data on injuries observed from falls, road traffic injuries and injuries related to animals suggest potential areas for injury prevention. This is the biggest prospective injury surveillance study in Nepal in recent years and supports the case for using injury surveillance to monitor child morbidity and mortality through improved data.","Magnus, Dan; Bhatta, Santosh; Mytton, Julie; Joshi, Elisha; Bhatta, Sumiksha; Manandhar, Sunil; Joshi, Sunil",Archives of disease in childhood,862,1

However, comorbidity burden is often represented by a simple count of few conditions that may not fully capture patients' complexity. Purpose: To evaluate the performance of a comprehensive index of the comorbidity burden (Queralt DxS), which includes all chronic conditions present on admission, as an adjustment variable in models for predicting critical illness in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and compare it with two broadly used measures of comorbidity. Patients and methods: We analyzed data from all COVID-19 hospitalizations reported in eight public hospitals of Catalonia (North-East Spain) between June 15 and December 8 2020. The primary outcome was a composite of critical illness that included the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, transfer to ICU, or in-hospital death. Predictors included age, sex, and comorbidities present on admission measured using three indices: the Charlson index, the Elixhauser index, and the Queralt DxS index for comorbidities on admission. The performance of different fitted models was compared using various indicators, including the area under the receiving operating characteristics curve (AUC). Results: Our analysis included 4,607 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Of them, 1,315 experienced critical illness. Comorbidities significantly contributed to predicting the outcome in all summary indices used. The AUC for prediction of critical illness was 0.641 (95% CI 0.624-0.660) for the Charlson index, 0.665 (0.645-0.681) for the Elixhauser index, and 0.787 (0.773-0.801) for Queralt DxS. Other metrics of model performance also showed Queralt DxS being consistently superior to the other indices. Conclusion: In our analysis, the ability of comorbidity indices to predict hospital outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients increased with their exhaustivity. The comprehensive Queralt DxS index may improve the accuracy of predictive models for resource allocation and clinical decision-making in the hospital setting.","Monterde, D.; Carot-Sans, G.; Cainzos-Achirica, M.; Abilleira, S.; Coca, M.; Vela, E.; Cleries, M.; Valero, D.; Comin-Colet, J.; Garcia-Eroles, L.; Perez-Sust, P.; Arrufat, M.; Lejardi, Y.; Piera-Jimenez, J.",,862,21

Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are valuable parameters that can be evaluated in routine blood tests and provide information about the inflammation in many diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of NLR and PLR on mortality. Methods. Our cross-sectional cohort study included patients who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 with positive polymerase chain reaction test results and patients whose test results were negative at the time of the first admission to the hospital, but whose computed tomography imaging was suspicious for COVID-19 and test results were found to be positive in repeated tests during their hospitalization. Prognosis of the hospitalization outcomes was investigated and discharge, hospital admission, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality data during the 30 days were recorded and the relationship between these parameters was evaluated. Results. The mean age of the patients was 57.5 ± 16.7 years. Cough was the most common symptom and was present in over half of patients. Almost one-third of patients (27.1%) had at least three symptoms at presentation. Both increased levels of NLR and PLR were observed to significantly predict the mortality of patients with COVID-19 (p<0.001, p=0.001, respectively). Sensitivity and specificity were 65.2% and 80.4% for NLR (AUC: 0.767, cutoff> 5.49) and 43.5% and 81.9% for PLR, respectively (AUC: 0.622, cut-off>228.13). Conclusions. The present study has concluded that NLR and PLR are effective mortality predictors in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. © Bozan O., ekmen B., Atis S. E., Kocer M. T., Senturk M., Karaaslan E.

How germline and somatic tissues are coordinated for the morphogenesis of each separated unit remains poorly understood. Here, using improved live-imaging of Drosophila ovaries, we uncovered periodic actomyosin waves at the cortex of germ cells. These contractile waves are associated with pressure release blebs, which project from germ cells into somatic cells. We demonstrate that these cortical activities, together with cadherin-based adhesion, are required to sort each germline cyst as one collective unit. Genetic perturbations of cortical contractility, blebs protrusion or adhesion between germline and somatic cells induced failures to encapsulate any germ cells or the inclusion of too many germ cells or even the mechanical split of germline cysts. Our results reveal that germ cells play an active role in the physical coupling with somatic cells to produce the female gamete.","Chanet, Soline; Huynh, Jean-René",bioRxiv,862,14

In addition, the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has further compounded the effect of health inequities observed in Indigenous populations, including NHPI communities. Reversible lifestyle habits, such as diet, may either be protective of or contribute to the increasing prevalence of health inequities in these populations via the immunoepigenetic-microbiome axis. This axis offers insight into the connection between diet, epigenetics, the microbiome composition, immune function, and response to viral infection. Epigenetic mechanisms that regulate inflammatory states associated with metabolic diseases, including diabetes, are impacted by diet. Furthermore, diet may modulate the gut microbiome by influencing microbial diversity and richness;dysbiosis of the microbiome is associated with chronic disease. A high fiber diet facilitates a favorable microbiome composition and in turn increases production of intermediate metabolites named short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that act on metabolic and immune pathways. In contrast, low fiber diets typically associated with a westernized lifestyle decreases the abundance of microbial derived SCFAs. This decreased abundance is characteristic of metabolic syndromes and activation of chronic inflammatory states, having larger implications in disease pathogenesis of both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders that once thrived on healthy traditional diets may be more sensitive than non-indigenous peoples to the metabolic perturbation of westernized diets that impinge on the immunoepigenetic-gut microbiome axis. Recent studies conducted in the Maunakea lab at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa John A. Burns School of Medicine have helped elucidate the connections between diet, microbiome composition, metabolic syndrome, and epigenetic regulation of immune function to better understand disease pathogenesis. Potentially, this research could point to ways to prevent pre-disease conditions through novel biomarker discovery using community-based approaches.","Rubas, N.

Serological tests are acknowledged to have high sensitivity, but issues due to cross-reactions with other parasites, native parasite antigen supply and intrinsic test variability do occur. Assays based on recombinant antigens could represent an improvement. The aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of two novel immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgG4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) based on the recombinant antigens NIE/SsIR for the diagnosis of strongyloidiasis. METHODS: This was a retrospective diagnostic accuracy study. We included serum samples collected from immigrants from strongyloidiasis endemic areas for whom there was a matched result for Strongyloides stercoralis on agar plate culture and/or PCR assay, or a positive microscopy for S. stercoralis larvae. For the included samples, results were also available from an in-house indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and a commercial (Bordier ELISA; Bordier Affinity Products SA) ELISA. We excluded: (i) samples with insufficient serum volume; (ii) samples from patients treated with ivermectin in the previous 6 months; and (iii) sera from patients for whom only routine coproparasitology was performed after formol-ether concentration, if negative for S. stercoralis larvae. The performance of the novel assays was assessed against: (i) a primary reference standard, with samples classified as negative/positive on the basis of the results of fecal tests; (ii) a composite reference standard (CRS), which also considered patients to be positive who had concordant positive results for the IFAT and Bordier ELISA or with a single ""high titer"" positive result for the IFAT or Bordier ELISA. Samples with a single positive test, either for the IFAT or Bordier ELISA, at low titer, were considered to be ""indeterminate,"" and analyses were carried out with and without their inclusion. RESULTS: When assessed against the primary reference standard, the sensitivities of the IgG and IgG4 ELISAs were 92% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 88-97%) and 81% (95% CI: 74-87%), respectively, and the specificities were 91% (95% CI: 88-95%) and 94% (95% CI: 91-97%), respectively. When tested against the CRS, the IgG ELISA performed best, with 78% sensitivity (95% CI: 72-83%) and 98% specificity (95% CI: 96-100%), when a cut-off of 0.675 was applied and the indeterminate samples were excluded from the analysis. CONCLUSION: The NIE-SsIR IgG ELISA demonstrated better accuracy than the IgG4 assay and was deemed promising particularly for serosurveys in endemic areas.","Tamarozzi, Francesca; Longoni, Silvia Stefania; Mazzi, Cristina; Pettene, Sofia; Montresor, Antonio; Mahanty, Siddhartha; Bisoffi, Zeno; Buonfrate, Dora",Parasit Vectors,862,1

On January 22-23 and January 30, 2020, EC convened and discussed whether the situation in China and other countries would constitute PHEIC and issued recommendations for WHO, China and the international community. Based on the recommendations of EC, WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a PHEIC. One of the purposes of the declaration of PHEIC was to alarm countries with weak public health infrastructures to prepare promptly for emerging infectious diseases (EID) and provide WHO with a framework for proactively supporting those countries. On February 3, 2020, WHO proposed the 2019 COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, which includes accelerating research and development (R&D) processes as one of three major strategies. On February 11-12, 2020, WHO held the Global Research and Innovation Forum: Towards a Research Roadmap for COVID-19. The fact that a COVID-19 R&D forum was the first meeting convened after the PHEIC declaration testifies to the importance of R&D in response to EID. Korea has demonstrated a remarkable capacity in its laboratory response by conducting high-throughput COVID-19 testing and utilizing innovative drive-through samplings. These measures for early detection and screening of cases should be followed by full efforts to produce research-based evidence by thoroughly analyzing epidemiological, clinical and immunological data, which will facilitate the development of vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19. It is expected that Korea plays a global partner for COVID-19 research by actively participating in immediate and mid/long-term priorities jointly led by WHO and global partners.","Jee, Youngmee",Epidemiol Health,862,23

On January 22-23 and January 30, 2020, EC convened and discussed whether the situation in China and other countries would constitute PHEIC and issued recommendations for WHO, China and the international community. Based on the recommendations of EC, WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a PHEIC. One of the purposes of the declaration of PHEIC was to alarm countries with weak public health infrastructures to prepare promptly for emerging infectious diseases (EID) and provide WHO with a framework for proactively supporting those countries. On February 3, 2020, WHO proposed the 2019 COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, which includes accelerating research and development (R&D) processes as one of three major strategies. On February 11-12, 2020, WHO held the Global Research and Innovation Forum: Towards a Research Roadmap for COVID-19.

Restrictions on group gatherings and in-person engagement have increased the demand for remote service delivery. These restrictions have also affected the delivery of court-mandated interventions. However, much of the literature has focused on populations that voluntarily seek out face-to-face medical care or mental health services, whereas insufficient attention has been paid to telehealth engagement of court-mandated populations. This article draws on data gathered on an NIH/NIDA-funded study intervention implemented with juvenile justice-involved youths of Haitian heritage in Miami-Dade County, Florida, during the COVID-19 public health crisis. We explore the process of obtaining consent, technological access issues, managing privacy, and other challenges associated with remote delivery of family-based therapy to juvenile justice-involved youth. Our aim is to provide some insights for consideration by therapists, healthcare workers, advocates, researchers, and policymakers tasked with finding alternative and safer ways to engage nontraditional populations in health services. The clinical trial registration number is NCT03876171.","Marcelin, Louis Herns; Cela, Toni; Dembo, Richard; Jean-Gilles, Michèle; Page, Bryan; Demezier, Danna; Clement, Roy; Waldman, Rachel",,862,16
