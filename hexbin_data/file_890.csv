Before the pandemic, students were already experiencing substantial mental health concerns, putting both their health and academic success in jeopardy. College students now face increasing housing and food insecurity, financial hardships, a lack of social connectedness and sense of belonging, uncertainty about the future, and access issues that impede their academic performance and well-being. There is also reason to believe that COVID-19 is exacerbating inequalities for students of color and low-income students. We provide several recommendations for institutions of higher education to mitigate these obstacles, including engaging in data-driven decision making, delivering clear and informative messaging to students, prioritizing and expanding student support services, and using an equity framework to guide all processes.","Lederer, Alyssa M; Hoban, Mary T; Lipson, Sarah K; Zhou, Sasha; Eisenberg, Daniel",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,890,16

ODC is activated by antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1) and 2 (AZIN2). AZIN1 and recently AZIN2 have been related to cancer, however, their functions in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) have not been studied. We evaluated the immunoexpression of AZIN1 and 2 in tumor tissue from ACC patients, and related the results to clinical and clinicopathological features and patient survival. STUDY DESIGN We performed immunohistochemical study on minor salivary and mucous gland ACC tissue samples of patients treated at the Helsinki University Hospital (Helsinki, Finland) during 1974-2012. We scored AZIN1 and 2 immunoexpression in 42 and 45 tumor tissue samples, respectively, and correlated them with clinicopathological factors and survival. RESULTS Enhanced AZIN2 expression was associated with better survival. In addition, both AZINs were seen more commonly in cribriform and tubular than in solid growth patterns. AZIN1 expression did not correlate with the studied clinicopathological factors. CONCLUSIONS It seems that AZIN2 expression is higher in cancer tissue with secretory functions. In ACC tissue, high AZIN2 expression could be related to well-differentiated histological type which still has a functioning vesicle transportation system. Thus, AZIN2 could be a prognostic factor for better survival of ACC patients.","Hämetoja, Hanna; Andersson, Leif C; Mäkitie, Antti; Bäck, Leif; Hagström, Jaana; Haglund, Caj","APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",890,20

Only a small proportion of patients require neurosurgical intervention, while many guidelines recommend routine admission of all patients. We aim to validate the Hull Salford Cambridge Decision Rule (HSC DR) and the Brain Injury Guidelines (BIG) criteria to select low-risk patients for discharge from the emergency department. METHOD A cohort from 18 countries of Glasgow Coma Scale 13-15 patients with injuries on CT imaging was identified from the multicentre Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI (CENTER-TBI) Study (conducted from 2014 to 2017) for secondary analysis. A composite outcome measure encompassing need for ongoing hospital admission was used, including seizure activity, death, intubation, neurosurgical intervention and neurological deterioration. We assessed the performance of our previously derived prognostic model, the HSC DR and the BIG criteria at predicting deterioration in this validation cohort. RESULTS Among 1047 patients meeting the inclusion criteria, 267 (26%) deteriorated. Our prognostic model achieved a C-statistic of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.78 to 0.84). The HSC DR achieved a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 97% to 100%) and specificity of only 4.7% (95% CI: 3.3% to 6.5%) for deterioration. Using the BIG criteria for discharge from the ED achieved a higher specificity (13.3%, 95% CI: 10.9% to 16.1%) and lower sensitivity (94.6%, 95% CI: 90.5% to 97%), with 12/105 patients recommended for discharge subsequently deteriorating, compared with 0/34 with the HSC DR. CONCLUSION Our decision rule would have allowed 3.5% of patients to be discharged, none of whom would have deteriorated. Use of the BIG criteria may select patients for discharge who have too high a risk of subsequent deterioration to be used clinically. Further validation and implementation studies are required to support use in clinical practice.","Marincowitz, Carl; Gravesteijn, Benjamin; Sheldon, Trevor; Steyerberg, Ewout; Lecky, Fiona",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,890,31

Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) degrades the octapeptide ANG II to form the heptapeptide ANG1-7 and thereby limits ANG II accumulation. On this basis, we hypothesized that ACE-2 would be protective against experimental lung fibrogenesis and might be downregulated in human and experimental lung fibrosis. In lung biopsy specimens from patients with IPF, ACE-2 mRNA and enzyme activity were decreased by 92% (P<0.01) and 74% (P<0.05), respectively. ACE-2 mRNA and activity were also decreased similarly in the lungs of bleomycin-treated rats and C57-BL6 mice. In mice exposed to low doses of bleomycin, lung collagen accumulation was enhanced by intratracheal administration of either ACE-2-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or the peptide DX(600), a competitive inhibitor of ACE-2 (P<0.05). Administration of either ACE-2 siRNA or DX(600) significantly increased the ANG II content of mouse lung tissue above the level induced by bleomycin alone. Coadministration of the ANG II receptor antagonist saralasin blocked the DX(600)-induced increase in lung collagen. Moreover, purified recombinant human ACE-2, delivered to mice systemically by osmotic minipump, attenuated bleomycin-induced lung collagen accumulation. Together, these data show that ACE-2 mRNA and activity are severely downregulated in both human and experimental lung fibrosis and suggest that ACE-2 protects against lung fibrogenesis by limiting the local accumulation of the profibrotic peptide ANG II.","Li, Xiaopeng; Molina-Molina, Maria; Abdul-Hafez, Amal; Uhal, Victor; Xaubet, Antonio; Uhal, Bruce D",American journal of physiology.

Depression is a common illness associated with chronic inflammatory disease states. Data have suggested a significant role of inflammation in the progression of BPH. METHODS The present prospective study involved 547 male patients who completed the Geriatric Depression Scale and the AUA-SI. We evaluated whether the mean AUA-SI score and the severity categories differed by the state of depression. We then conducted binary logistic regression analysis with forward stepwise regression to assess the relationship between depression and the severity symptoms as determined by the AUA-SI score. RESULTS Of the cohort, 22% screened positive for depressive symptoms. The depressed patients (Geriatric Depression Scale score >5) reported significantly more severe symptoms (mean AUA-SI score 16.61 ± 9.89) compared with the nondepressed patients (Geriatric Depression Scale score of ≤5 and mean AUA-SI score 10.65 ± 7.29; F = 40.19, P <.001). After controlling for socioeconomic and demographic variables, depressed patients were 3 times more likely to present with severe symptoms (odds ratio 3.079, 95% confidence interval 1.129-8.402, P = .028). CONCLUSIONS A significant association was found between depression and BPH. However, it remains unclear whether this relationship represents unidirectional or bidirectional causality. Additional research is imperative to assess the nature of this correlation, either to address comorbid depression in patients with BPH or to ensure that depressed patients do not report falsely elevated symptoms.","Johnson, Timothy V; Abbasi, Ammara; Ehrlich, Samantha S; Kleris, Renee S; Chirumamilla, Siri L; Schoenberg, Evan D; Owen-Smith, Ashli; Raison, Charles L; Master, Viraj A",Urology,890,1

DESIGN Twenty-one healthy volunteers were included in the study and tested in air conduction with a ""belly-tendon"" montage. Recording conditions were randomized for each participant and each modality was tested twice to check the reproducibility of the procedure. RESULTS NB CE-Chirps at 500 Hz revealed larger n1-p1 amplitudes than 500 Hz TBs (p = .001), which were also larger than NB CE-Chirps and TBs at 1000 Hz (p = .022, p < .001, respectively). Besides, n1 and p1 latencies were shorter in NB CE-Chirp than in TB at 500 Hz (p < .001) and 1000 Hz (p < .001). The older the participants, the lower the amplitudes (p = .021, p = .031) and the longer the n1 (p = .030, p = .025) and p1 latencies (p < .001, p < .001) in 500 Hz NB CE-Chirps and 500 Hz TBs. Interaural asymmetry ratios were slightly higher in 500 Hz NB CE-Chirps as compared to 500 Hz TBs (p = .013). CONCLUSIONS NB CE-Chirps at 500 Hz improved the amplitudes of waveforms in oVEMPs. As for TBs with clicks before, enhancing oVEMPs amplitudes is an essential step to distinguish a healthy person from a patient with either utricular or its related pathways disorder and potentially minimize the risk of cochlear damages. Additional studies including a higher number of healthy participants and patients with vestibular disorders are required to confirm this hypothesis. The large interindividual variability of interaural asymmetry ratios in NB CE-Chirp and in TB at 500 Hz could be explained by the selected montage.","Mat, Quentin; Duterme, Jean-Pierre; Tainmont, Sophie; Lelubre, Christophe; Manto, Mario",Ear and hearing,890,1

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to discover the relationship between specific symptoms and specific medicines, especially of symptoms occurring frequently in this disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS Worldwide collection of data in all possible formats by various parties was coordinated by the Liga Medicorum Homeopathica Internationalis. As the data came in, more symptoms were assessed prospectively. Frequent analysis and feedback by electronic newsletters were used to improve the quality of the data. Likelihood ratios (LRs) of symptoms were calculated. An algorithm for combining symptom LRs was programmed and published in the form of an app. The app was tested against 18 well-described successful cases from Hong Kong. RESULTS LRs of common symptoms such as 'Fatigue' and 'Headache' provided better differentiation between medicines than did existing repertory entries, which are based only on the narrow presence or absence of symptoms. A mini-repertory for COVID-19 symptoms was published and supported by a web-based algorithm. With a choice of 20 common symptoms, this algorithm produced the same outcome as a full homeopathic analysis based upon a larger number of symptoms, including some that are traditionally considered more specific to particular medicines. CONCLUSION A repertory based on clinical data and LRs can differentiate between homeopathic medicines using a limited number of frequently occurring epidemic symptoms. A Bayesian computer algorithm to combine symptoms can complement a full homeopathic analysis of cases.","Rutten, Lex; Smedley, Tom; Ives, Galen; Gold, Peter; Merizalde, Bernardo; van Haselen, Robbert; Manchanda, Raj Kumar; Ross, Ashley; Cataldi, Gustavo; Agaoglu, Altunay; di Giampietro, Tiziana; Lilas, Theodore; Schroyens, Frederik; Eizayaga, José E",Homeopathy : the journal of the Faculty of Homeopathy,890,25

METHODS This retrospective study comprised 41 ablation sessions for 39 patients (22 men and 17 women; mean age, 64.8 years). Vital capacity (VC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) at 1 and 3 months after RFA were compared with the baseline (i.e., values before RFA). To evaluate the factors that influenced impaired pulmonary function, univariate analysis was performed by using multiple variables. If two or more variables were indicated as statistically significant by univariate analysis, these variables were subjected to multivariate analysis to identify independent factors. RESULTS The mean VC and FEV(1) before RFA and 1 and 3 months after RFA were 3.04 and 2.24 l, 2.79 and 2.11 l, and 2.85 and 2.13 l, respectively. The values at 1 and 3 months were significantly lower than the baseline. Severe pleuritis after RFA was identified as the independent factor influencing impaired VC at 1 month (P = 0.003). For impaired FEV(1) at 1 month, only severe pleuritis (P = 0.01) was statistically significant by univariate analysis. At 3 months, severe pleuritis (VC, P = 0.019; FEV(1), P = 0.003) and an ablated parenchymal volume ≥20 cm(3) (VC, P = 0.047; FEV(1), P = 0.038) were independent factors for impaired VC and FEV(1). CONCLUSIONS Pulmonary function decreased after RFA. RFA-induced severe pleuritis and ablation of a large volume of marginal parenchyma were associated with impaired pulmonary function.","Tada, Akihiro; Hiraki, Takao; Iguchi, Toshihiro; Gobara, Hideo; Mimura, Hidefumi; Toyooka, Shinichi; Kiura, Katsuyuki; Tsuda, Toshihide; Mitsuhashi, Toshiharu; Kanazawa, Susumu",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,890,17

The ascending pharyngeal artery (APA) is a less frequently explored transarterial route because of its small caliber, potential anastomoses to the internal carotid and vertebral arteries, and vital supply to lower cranial nerves. OBJECTIVE To review our institutional experience and highlight the prevalence of APA supply to dAVFs and cases where it is a safe and effective pedicle for embolization. METHODS We reviewed our endovascular database (January 1, 1996 to March 1, 2016) for cranial dAVFs, evaluating dAVF characteristics and embolization results for those treated transarterially via the APA. RESULTS Of 267 endovascularly treated dAVFs, 68 had APA supply (25%). Of these 68 dAVFs, embolization was carried out via this pedicle in 8 (12%) and 7 were ultimately occluded. No complications, including post-treatment cranial neuropathies or radiographic evidence of non-target embolization, were found. For 5 dAVFs, the APA was selected as the initial pedicle for embolization (two marginal sinus, one distal sigmoid, one cavernous, one tentorial). In four of these five cases, dAVF occlusion was achieved via the initial APA feeding artery pedicle. In one case, near-complete, stagnant occlusion was achieved after APA embolization; complete occlusion was achieved after adjunctive embolization of a single additional middle meningeal artery pedicle. In three other cases of complex transverse/sigmoid dAVFs, the APA was used after multiple attempts via middle meningeal and occipital artery pedicles. Occlusion was not achieved transarterially; two of these three dAVFs were ultimately occluded transvenously. CONCLUSIONS In rare, select cases, the APA is an excellent route for transarterial embolization of cranial dAVFs.","Gross, Bradley A; Albuquerque, Felipe C; Moon, Karam; McDougall, Cameron G",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,890,1

Dental professionals in resource poor countries, as opposed to those in developed countries, face additional challenges due to the lack of personal protective equipment, and chronic infrastructural impediments extant in such jurisdictions, such as regular and chronic interruptions to electricity and water supplies. OBJECTIVES To address this new 'normal' which dictates that dentistry has to 'adapt and adopt' in order to deliver care to the needy, particularly in resource poor nations, whilst care deliverers take appropriate precautionary measures to obviate cross infection. METHODS A review was preformed of the challenges to delivery of infection control measures in dentistry in resource meagre settings, and practical interventional measures proposed to mitigate these challenges, taking South Africa as a case study. RESULTS In reality, optimal infection control measures cannot be implemented in delivering dental care in resource poor settings, a challenge that has been ill addressed by the relevant authoritative bodies. A re-adaptation of infection control guidelines that could be simply implemented in such settings has been formulated. CONCLUSION We present practical infection control guidelines to lessen the burden of dental professionals in resource poor countries who dispense treatment under trying circumstance. The strategic infection control measures, including engineering and administrative controls outlined could be applicable in jurisdictions with a diminished capacity to respond to local, regional or national infection control guide-lines, due to financial, regulatory, or other infrastructural resource deficiencies.","Blignaut, Elaine; Nemutandani, Simon; Samaranayake, Lakshman",Acta odontologica Scandinavica,890,0

People living with HIV (PLHIV) may have greater risk of contracting or developing severe COVID-19 due to the underlying HIV infection or higher prevalence of comorbidities. DesignThis is a cohort study, including PLHIV diagnosed, hospitalized, or requiring intensive services for COVID-19. MethodsData sources include routine electronic medical record or claims data from the U.S. and Spain. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and medication history are described. ResultFour data sources had a population of HIV/COVID-19 coinfected patients ranging from 288 to 4606 lives. PLHIV diagnosed with COVID-19 were younger than HIV-negative patients diagnosed with COVID-19. PLHIV diagnosed with COVID-19 diagnosis had similar comorbidities as HIV-negative COVID-19 patients with higher prevalence of those comorbidities and history of severe disease. Treatment regimens were similar between PLHIV diagnosed with COVID-19 or PLHIV requiring intensive services. ConclusionsOur study uses routine practice data to explore HIV impact on COVID-19, providing insight into patient history prior to COVID-19. We found that HIV and COVID-19 coinfected patients have higher prevalence of underlying comorbidities such as cardiovascular and respiratory disease as compared to HIV-negative COVID-19 infected patients. We also found that, across the care cascade, co-infected patients who received intensive services were more likely to have more serious underlying disease or a history of more serious events as compared to PLHIV who were diagnosed with COVID-19.","Kohler, Julianna; Kostka, Kristin M; Makadia, Rupa; Paredes, Roger; Duarte-Salles, Talita; Duvall, Scott L; Matheny, Michael; Lynch, Kristine E; Cheng, Alison; Golozar, Asieh; Lane, Jennifer C E; Sena, Anthony G; Rijnbeek, Peter J; Morales, Daniel R; Ryan, Patrick B; Reich, Christian G; Siberry, George; Prieto-Alhambra, Daniel",,890,1

Much of the apparent adverse outcome may relate to such strokes usually being severe. We examined the influence of right and left insular involvement on stroke outcomes among patients from the IST-3 study (Third International Stroke Trial) who had visible ischemic stroke on neuroimaging. METHODS We used multiple logistic regression to compare outcomes of left versus right insular and noninsular strokes across strata of stroke severity, on death, proportion dead or dependent, and level of disability (ordinalized Oxford Handicap Score) at 6 months, with adjustment for the effects of age, lesion size, and presence of atrial fibrillation. RESULTS Of 3035 patients recruited, 2099 had visible ischemic strokes limited to a single hemisphere on computed tomography/magnetic resonance scans. Of these, 566 and 714 had infarction of right and left insula. Six months after randomization, right insular involvement was associated with increased odds of death when compared with noninsular strokes on the left side (adjusted odds ratio, 1.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.33-2.52), whereas the adjusted odds ratio comparing mortality after insular versus noninsular strokes on the left side was not significant. Among mild/moderate strokes, outcomes for right insular involvement were worse than for left insular, but among more severe strokes, the difference in outcomes was less substantial. CONCLUSIONS We found an association between right insular involvement and higher odds of death and worse functional outcome. The difference between right- and left-sided insular lesions on outcomes seemed to be most evident for mild/moderate strokes. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.isrctn.com.

Methods We performed a cross-sectional survey with 13 Likert-scale responses and some additional polar questions pertaining to dressing habits and learning in a university hospital in the midwest United States. Descriptive and analytical statistics were performed. Results The 370 respondents (66.1% response rate, age 38.5±11.6 years; 64.9% female), included 102 supervising providers [96 (25.9%) physicians, 6 (1.6%) mid-level], 64 (17.3%) residents/fellows, 73 (19.7% nurses, 45 (12.2%) respiratory therapists, 31 (8.4%) therapy services and others: 12 (3.2%) case-managers, 4 (1.1%) dietitians, 39 (10.5%) unclassified]. Overall, 200 (54.1%) had increased anxiety, 115 (31.1%) felt overwhelmed, 159 (42.9%) had fear of death, and 281 (75.9%) changed dressing habits. Females were more anxious (70.7% vs. 56%, X2 (1, N=292)=5.953, p=0.015), overwhelmed (45.6% vs. 27.3%, X2 (1, N=273)=8.67, p=0.003) and suffered sleep disturbances (52% vs. 39%, X2 (1, N=312)=4.91, p=0.027). Administration was supportive; 243 (84.1%, N=289), 276 (74.5%) knew another co-worker with COVID-19, and only 93 (25.1%) felt healthcare employment was less favorable. Residents and fellows reported a negative impact on their training despite feeling supported by their program. Conclusion Despite belief of a supportive administration, over half of healthcare workers and learners reported increased anxiety, and nearly a third felt overwhelmed during this current pandemic.","Maduke, Tinashe; Dorroh, James; Bhat, Ambarish; Krvavac, Armin; Regunath, Hariharan",Missouri medicine,890,17

Previous studies have shown that the leader RNA in the DI genome significantly enhances the efficiency of DI subgenomic mRNA transcription, indicating that the leader RNA is a cis-acting sequence for mRNA transcription. To further characterize the cis-acting sequence, we made a series of deletion mutants, all but one of which have an additional deletion of the cis-acting signal for replication in the 5' untranslated region. This deletion effectively eliminated the replication of the DI-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT)-reporter, as demonstrated by the sensitive reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. The ability of these replication-minus mutants to transcribe subgenomic mRNAs was then assessed using the DI RNA-CAT reporter system. Results from both CAT activity and mRNA transcripts detected by RT-PCR showed that a 5'-proximal sequence of 35 nucleotides (nt) at nt 25 to 59 is a cis-acting sequence required for subgenomic RNA transcription, while the consensus repeat sequence of the leader RNA does not have such effect. Analyses of the secondary structure indicate that this 35-nt sequence forms two stem-loops conserved among MHVs. Deletion of this sequence abrogated transcriptional activity and disrupted the predicted stem-loops and overall RNA secondary structure at the 5' untranslated region, suggesting that the secondary structure formed by this 35-nt sequence may facilitate the downstream consensus sequence accessible for the discontinuous RNA transcription. This may provide a mechanism by which the 5' cis-acting sequence regulates subgenomic RNA transcription. The 5'-most 24 nt are not essential for transcription, while the 9 nt immediately downstream of the leader enhances RNA transcription. The sequence between nt 86 and 135 had little effect on transcription. This study thus defines the cis-acting transcription signal at the 5' end of the DI genome.","Wang, Y; Zhang, X",Journal of virology,890,9

She had been diagnosed several years earlier but was reluctant to undergo surgery. Case HYPOTHESIS Diagnosis of this X-linked recessive inherited syndrome characterizes by disturbance of virilization in males with an AR mutation, XY karyotipe, female genitalia and severely undescended testis with risk of malignization. The optimal time to orchidectomy is not settled; neither the real risk of malignancy in these patients. Early surgery impacts development of a complete female phenotype, with enlargement of the breasts. Based on modern diagnostic imaging using DCE-MRI and surgical technology with single port laparoscopic access we hypothesize that the optimum time for gonadectomy is not at the time of diagnosis, but once feminization has completed. PROMISING FUTURE IMPLICATIONS An umbilical laparoendoscopic single-site access for bilateral gonadectomy appears to be the first choice approach as leaves no visible incision and diminishes the psychological impact of surgery in a patient with CAIS absolutely reassured as female. KeyPort, a single port access with duo-rotate instruments developed by Richard Wolf facilitates this surgery and allows excellent cosmetic results.","Andrade, Felipe P; Cabrera, Pedro M; Cáceres, Felipe; Gil, Belen; Rodríguez-Barbero, José M; Angulo, Javier C",International braz j urol : official journal of the Brazilian Society of Urology,890,22

Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is produced in response to infections and tissue injuries and is believed to play a pivotal role in the event of a cytokine storm, as signified by its increase in the process. Considering the role of IL-6 as a pro-inflammatory cytokine in the process of cytokine storm in COVID-19, perceiving IL-6 as a therapeutic target could prove to be promising. Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that competitively inhibits the binding of IL-6 to its receptor (IL-6R). The use of IL-6R blocker is recommended for severe COVID-19 patients in the latest therapeutic guideline published by the World Health Organization (WHO), but the timing of the administration has not been specified. While previous studies about the use of tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients have shown various results, these studies do not emphasize on plasma IL-6 levels when deciding the time of tocilizumab administration. In this case series, we present three patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infections that receive tocilizumab as an adjunct to the standard of care therapy. This case series introduces the novel idea that the timely use of tocilizumab as signified by plasma IL-6 levels in moderate to severe COVID-19 patients could potentially improve overall clinical condition and increase survival rate.","Tenda, Eric Daniel; Andrian, Setiabakti; Albert, Sedjahtera; Asaf, Moses M; Pitoyo, Ceva W; Setiati, Siti; Subekti, Imam",Acta medica Indonesiana,890,9

Despite widespread use of symptom-based screening tools in Ontario, there are no data supporting the accuracy of these screening tools in hospitalized patients. OBJECTIVE To measure the performance characteristics of infection screening tools used during the H1N1 influenza season. METHODS The present retrospective cohort study was conducted at The Ottawa Hospital (Ottawa, Ontario) between October and December, 2009. Consecutive inpatients admitted from the emergency department were included if they were ≥18 years of age, underwent a screening tool assessment at presentation and had a most responsible diagnosis that was cardiac, respiratory or infectious. The gold-standard outcome was laboratory diagnosis of influenza. RESULTS The prevalence of laboratory-confirmed influenza was 23.5%. The sensitivity and specificity of the febrile respiratory illness screening tool were 74.5% (95% CI 60.5% to 84.8%) and 32.7% (95% CI 25.8% to 40.5%), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the influenza-like illness screening tool were 75.6% (95% CI 61.3% to 85.8%) and 46.3% (95% CI 38.2% to 54.7%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS The febrile respiratory illness screening tool missed 26% of active influenza cases, while 67% of noninfluenza patients were unnecessarily placed under respiratory isolation. Results of the present study suggest that infection-control practitioners should re-evaluate their strategy of screening patients at admission for contagious respiratory illness using symptom- and sign-based tests. Future efforts should focus on the derivation and validation of clinical decision rules that combine clinical features with laboratory tests.","Mulpuru, Sunita; Roth, Virginia R; Lawrence, Nadine; Forster, Alan J",Canadian respiratory journal,890,26

To enable rapid and sensitive detection of even the most prevalent causes, there is a need for more-simplified testing systems that enable researchers and clinicians to perform multiplexed molecular diagnostics quickly and easily. To this end, a new multiplexed molecular test called the MultiCode-PLx respiratory virus panel (PLx-RVP) was developed and then implemented in a public health laboratory setting. A total of 687 respiratory samples were analyzed for the presence of 17 viruses that commonly cause respiratory disease. As a comparator, the samples were also tested using a standard testing algorithm that included the use of a real-time influenza virus A and B reverse transcription-PCR test and routine viral culture identification. The standard testing algorithm identified 503 (73%) samples as positive and 184 as negative. Analyzing the same 687 samples, the PLx-RVP assay detected one or more targets in 528 (77%) samples and found 159 samples negative for all targets. There were 25 discordant results between the two systems; 14 samples were positive for viruses not routinely tested for by the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene, and 13 of these were confirmed by real-time PCR.

Early diagnosis and isolation of mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 patients is important to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we investigate the potential clinical utility of lymphocyte CPD for early diagnosis of COVID-19. To investigate the potential of lymphocyte cell population data (lymphocyte CPD) for use in early diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Lymphocyte CPD of healthy control (n = 51), common cold patients (n = 49) and mild COVID-19 patients (n = 126) were generated using hematology analyzer. The parameters were subjected to sensitivity and specificity analysis to determine their suitability as biomarkers for early diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Normality analysis showed that lymphocyte CPD followed a normal distribution. There were no significant differences in white blood cells (WBC) and lymphocyte (LY#) counts as well as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) among the groups (p > 0.05). Lymphocyte volume standard deviation (LV-SD), lymphocyte conductivity standard deviation (LC-SD) and lymphocyte light scatter standard deviation (LS-SD) were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group than in common cold and control groups (p < 0.05). The corresponding mean lymphocyte light scattering (MLS) was significantly reduced in the COVID-19 group, relative to the common cold group, but was significantly increased, when compared with the control group (p < 0.05). Moreover, there was no significant difference in mean lymphocyte volume (MLV) between the COVID-19 group and the common cold or control group (p > 0.05), but it was significantly higher in the common cold group than in the control group (p < 0.05). At a cutoff value ≥ 16.38, LS-SD was more sensitive and specific than other lymphocyte CPD parameters. At a cutoff value ≥ 11.89, LC-SD achieved 84.4 % sensitivity, 87.5 % specificity, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.888. However, at a cutoff value ≥ 15.95, LS-SD reached 81.3 % sensitivity, 75 % specificity and an AUC of 0.876. These results suggest that lymphocyte CPD parameters have great diagnostic potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection and can be used for early diagnosis of the disease.","Zhu, Yihua; Cao, XingJian; Lu, Yonghui; Xu, Dongsheng; Lu, Renfei; Li, Xinling",Cellular and molecular biology,890,27

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the SARS catastrophe on an urban ED. METHODS The patients' characteristics in an urban ED were collected from March to May 2003 during the SARS outbreak in Taiwan. The crisis period was divided into 2 periods: 30 days before (period 1) and after (period 2) April 21, the date of the first hospital-associated transmission. Problem severity in the ED and stress levels of ED staff during the SARS catastrophe were rated from mild (1 point) to severe (5 points). RESULTS The number of ED patients declined 33.4% in period 2. There was a 2.1% (95%CI, 0.4-3.8) increase in the percentage of male patients, a 2.5% (95% CI, 1.5-3.7) increase in percentage of fever (>38 degrees C), and a 4.0% (95% CI, 2.6-5.4%) increase in chief complaint of fever in period 2. The number of nontrauma patients younger than 18 years had declined by 44.5% in period 2. The total charge for reimbursement from an insurance institution declined 21.7%. During the SARS outbreak, the most severe stress experienced by either physicians or nurses occurred during emergency resuscitation (median stress rating point, 4; interquartile range, 1). CONCLUSION The SARS catastrophe affected the ED visit volume, finances, various patient characteristics, and stress levels in the ED physicians and nurses.
