12675,Error in Figure,2020-08-24,"Climate change has become intertwined with the global economy. Here, we describe the contribution of inertia to future trends. Drawing from thermodynamic principles, and using 38 years of available statistics between 1980 to 2017, we find a constant scaling between current rates of world primary energy consumption [Image: see text] and the historical time integral W of past world inflation-adjusted economic production Y, or [Image: see text] . In each year, over a period during which both [Image: see text] and W more than doubled, the ratio of the two remained nearly unchanged, that is [Image: see text] Gigawatts per trillion 2010 US dollars. What this near constant implies is that current growth trends in energy consumption, population, and standard of living, perhaps counterintuitively, are determined by past innovations that have improved the economic production efficiency, or enabled use of less energy to transform raw materials into the makeup of civilization. Current observed growth rates agree well with predictions derived from available historical data. Future efforts to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions are likely also to be constrained by the contributions of past innovation to growth. Assuming no further efficiency gains, options look limited to rapid decarbonization of energy consumption through sustained implementation of at least one Gigawatt of renewable or nuclear power capacity per day. Alternatively, with continued reliance on fossil fuels, civilization could shift to a steady-state economy, one that devotes economic production exclusively to maintining ongoing metabolic needs rather than to material expansion. Even if such actions could be achieved immediately, energy consumption would continue at its current level, and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations would only begin to balance natural sinks at concentrations exceeding 500 ppmv.","Garrett, Timothy J.; Grasselli, Matheus; Keen, Stephen",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7451548/,626
12676,Error in Author Affiliation,2020-08-25,"BACKGROUND: Vaccination is the most important preventive measure for protection against infectious diseases in humans and companion animals. Nevertheless, scepticism about the safety and importance of vaccines is increasing in human and in veterinary medicine. Although owner attitudes towards vaccination have been investigated in cats, there are no similar studies in dogs. The goals of this study were therefore to investigate the vaccination status of dogs in Germany, to determine owner compliance with vaccination and to identify factors that play a role in owners’ decisions to have their dogs vaccinated. METHODS: Data were collected from August 2018 to February 2019 using an online survey targeting dog owners in Germany. A total of 3,881 questionnaires were evaluated, and factors associated with the vaccination status of dogs were determined by a linear logistic regression model using Akaike information criterion. Cohen's kappa statistic was used to evaluate agreement between questionnaire and 340 vaccination passports submitted voluntarily by owners. RESULTS: A total of 46.8% (n = 1,818/3,881) of dogs were vaccinated with core vaccines according to current guidelines with the lowest vaccination rate for leptospirosis (50.1%; n = 1,941/3,874). Dog’s age (16 weeks to 15 months) (odds ratio (OR): 3.08; 95% CI: 2.05–4.68), type (working dog) (OR: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.22–3.53) and travelling abroad within previous 36 months (OR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.12–2.96) had the strongest ‘positive’ association with the vaccination status. Recommendation from a veterinarian not to vaccinate against leptospirosis had the strongest ‘negative’ association (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.04–0.18). CONCLUSION: The study revealed a need for improvement in vaccination compliance because of inadequate vaccination coverage, especially for leptospirosis, in dogs. Factors influencing owner compliance were numerous. Vaccination recommendations made by the veterinarian had a strong association with the vaccination status and should be used to increase canine vaccination rates.","Eschle, Simone; Hartmann, Katrin; Rieger, Anna; Fischer, Sebastian; Klima, André; Bergmann, Michèle",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7451643/,626

In this study, PBMCs were collected from 17 human participants vaccinated with the split-inactivated influenza virus vaccine during the 2016–2017 influenza season. A combination of Immune Repertoire Capture (IRC(TM)) technology and IgG sequencing was performed on ~7,800 plasmablast (PB) cells and preferential IgG heavy-light chain pairings were investigated. In some participants, a single expanded clonotype accounted for ~22% of their PB BCR repertoire. Approximately 60% (10/17) of participants experienced convergent evolution, possessing public PBs that were elicited independently in multiple participants. Binding profiles of one private and three public PBs confirmed they were all subtype-specific, cross-reactive hemagglutinin (HA) head-directed antibodies. Collectively, this high-resolution antibody repertoire analysis demonstrated the impact evolution can have on BCRs in response to influenza virus vaccination, which can guide future universal influenza prophylactic approaches.","Forgacs, David; Abreu, Rodrigo B.; Sautto, Giuseppe A.; Kirchenbaum, Greg A.; Drabek, Elliott; Williamson, Kevin S.; Kim, Dongkyoon; Emerling, Daniel E.; Ross, Ted M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7899375/,626
16223,Error in Table,2021-03-09,"Mitochondrial genomes are highly conserved in many fungal groups, and they can help characterize the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary biology of plant pathogenic fungi. Rust fungi are among the most devastating diseases for economically important crops around the world. Here, we report the complete sequence and annotation of the mitochondrial genome of Austropuccinia psidii (syn. Puccinia psidii), the causal agent of myrtle rust. We performed a phylogenomic analysis including the complete mitochondrial sequences from other rust fungi. The genome composed of 93.299 bp has 73 predicted genes, 33 of which encoded nonconserved proteins (ncORFs), representing almost 45% of all predicted genes. A. psidii mtDNA is one of the largest rust mtDNA sequenced to date, most likely due to the abundance of ncORFs. Among them, 33% were within intronic regions of diverse intron groups. Mobile genetic elements invading intron sequences may have played significant roles in size but not shaping of the rust mitochondrial genome structure. The mtDNAs from rust fungi are highly syntenic. Phylogenetic inferences with 14 concatenated mitochondrial proteins encoded by the core genes placed A. psidii according to phylogenetic analysis based on 18S rDNA. Interestingly, cox1, the gene with the greatest number of introns, provided phylogenies not congruent with the core set. For the first time, we identified the proteins encoded by three A. psidii ncORFs using proteomics analyses. Also, the orf208 encoded a transmembrane protein repressed during in vitro morphogenesis. To the best of our knowledge, we presented the first report of a complete mtDNA sequence of a member of the family Sphaerophragmiacea.","de Almeida, Jaqueline Raquel; Riaño Pachón, Diego Mauricio; Franceschini, Livia Maria; dos Santos, Isaneli Batista; Ferrarezi, Jessica Aparecida; de Andrade, Pedro Avelino Maia; Monteiro-Vitorello, Claudia Barros; Labate, Carlos Alberto; Quecine, Maria Carolina",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7951889/,626
17883,"Prevalence of Immunosuppressive Drug Use Among Commercially Insured US Adults, 2018-2019",2021-05-20,"BACKGROUND: Until now, no robust data supported the efficacy, safety and recommendation for influenza vaccination in patients with cancer receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). METHODS: The prospective multicenter observational INfluenza Vaccine Indication During therapy with Immune checkpoint inhibitors (INVIDIa-2) study investigated the clinical effectiveness of influenza vaccination in patients with advanced cancer receiving ICIs, enrolled in 82 Italian centers from October 2019 to January 2020. The primary endpoint was the time-adjusted incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) until April 30, 2020. Secondary endpoints regarded ILI severity and vaccine safety. RESULTS: The study enrolled 1279 patients; 1188 patients were evaluable for the primary endpoint analysis. Of them, 48.9% (581) received influenza vaccination. The overall ILI incidence was 8.2% (98 patients). Vaccinated patients were significantly more frequently elderly (p<0.0001), males (p=0.004), with poor European Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (p=0.009), affected by lung cancer (p=0.01), and by other non-cancer comorbidities (p<0.0001) when compared with unvaccinated. ILI incidence was not different basing on influenza vaccination: the time-to-ILI was similar in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients (p=0.62). ILI complications were significantly less frequent for patients receiving the vaccination (11.8% vs 38.3% in unvaccinated, p=0.002). ILI-related intravenous therapies were significantly less frequent in vaccinated patients than in unvaccinated (11.8% vs 29.8%, p=0.027). ILI lethality was, respectively, 0% in vaccinated and 4.3% in unvaccinated patients. Vaccine-related adverse events were rare and mild (1.5%, grades 1–2). CONCLUSION: The INVIDIa-2 study results support a positive recommendation for influenza vaccination in patients with advanced cancer receiving immunotherapy.","Bersanelli, Melissa; Giannarelli, Diana; De Giorgi, Ugo; Pignata, Sandro; Di Maio, Massimo; Clemente, Alberto; Verzoni, Elena; Giusti, Raffaele; Di Napoli, Marilena; Aprile, Giuseppe; Ermacora, Paola; Catino, Annamaria; Scotti, Vieri; Mazzoni, Francesca; Guglielmini, Pamela Francesca; Veccia, Antonello; Maruzzo, Marco; Rossi, Ernesto; Grossi, Francesco; Casadei, Chiara; Ficorella, Corrado; Montesarchio, Vincenzo; Verderame, Francesco; Rizzo, Mimma; Guaitoli, Giorgia; Fratino, Lucia; Accettura, Caterina; Mencoboni, Manlio; Zustovich, Fable; Baldessari, Cinzia; Cinieri, Saverio; Camerini, Andrea; Laera, Letizia; Sorarù, Mariella; Zucali, Paolo Andrea; Guadalupi, Valentina; Leonardi, Francesco; Tiseo, Marcello; Tognetto, Michele; Di Costanzo, Francesco; Pinto, Carmine; Negrini, Giorgia; Russo, Antonio; Migliorino, Maria R; Filetti, Marco; Buti, Sebastiano",J Immunother Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8141439/,626

It provides an opportunity to explore the differences and similarities in stakeholder attitudes towards attraction management and reveals desired levels of participation of community in managing vandalism in tourism. This mixed method research employs community survey and interviews of site managers and government officials as its main data collection approach. It also offers an innovative approach to data analysis using the severity and optimist/pessimist psychographic variables coupled with quantitative analytical techniques. The results reveal complex relationship between psychographic profiles, future and current time dimensions, and location. In conclusion, the study offers several recommendations to city managers and policymakers on methods of vandalism control. It also highlights the importance of cultural context and its influence on community involvement. While this study is limited to tourism attractions, it provides a solid foundation for future research, one that can extend into urban planning and public policy design.","Bhati, Abhishek",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8174698/,626

19872,Assessment of the Financial Health of Rural Hospitals After Implementation of the Georgia Rural Hospital Tax Credit Program,2021-07-23,"BACKGROUND: Many teenagers in the United States experience challenges with symptoms of depression, and they lack adequate resources for accessing in-person mental health care. Involving teens and clinicians in designing technologies that use evidence-based practices that reduce barriers to accessing mental health care is crucial. Interventions based on behavioral activation (BA) help teens understand the relationship between mood and activity, help them practice goal-directed behaviors to improve mood, and may be particularly well-suited to delivery via internet-based platforms. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the needs and challenges that teens and mental health clinicians face in depression management and involve them in the design process of a remote intervention that uses asynchronous remote communities. Our goal is to understand the benefits and challenges of adapting BA to an internet-based platform that supports the asynchronous remote community approach as a delivery tool for teen depression management. METHODS: We enrolled mental health clinicians (n=10) and teens (n=8) in separate, private, internet-based groups on Slack (Slack Technologies Inc). They participated in 20-minute design activities for 10 weeks and were then invited to interviews about their experiences in the study. RESULTS: Both teen and clinician participants wanted internet-based support for BA as a supplement to in-person therapy. Although participants perceived the asynchronous format as conducive to supporting accessible care, teens and clinicians raised concerns about safety, privacy, and the moderating of the internet-based group. Design decisions that address these concerns need to be balanced with the potential benefits of learning coping skills, increasing access to mental health care, and promoting asynchronous human connection to support teens. CONCLUSIONS: We discuss considerations for balancing tensions in privacy and safety while designing and selecting internet-based platforms to support remote care and integrating evidence-based support when designing digital technologies for the treatment of teens with depression.","Bhattacharya, Arpita; Nagar, Ria; Jenness, Jessica; Munson, Sean A; Kientz, Julie A",JMIR Form Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8317030/,626
19966,Review of Head and Neck Masses in the Indian Population Based on Prevalence and Etiology With an Emphasis on Primary Diagnostic Modalities,2021-07-07,"People of recent sub-Saharan African ancestry develop kidney failure much more frequently than other groups. A large fraction of this disparity is due to two coding sequence variants in the APOL1 gene. Inheriting two copies of these APOL1 risk variants, known as G1 and G2, causes high rates of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), HIV-associated nephropathy and hypertension-associated end-stage kidney disease. Disease risk follows a recessive mode of inheritance, which is puzzling given the considerable data that G1 and G2 are toxic gain-of-function variants. We developed coisogenic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice harboring either the wild-type (G0), G1 or G2 forms of human APOL1. Expression of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) via plasmid tail vein injection results in upregulation of APOL1 protein levels together with robust induction of heavy proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis in G1/G1 and G2/G2 but not G0/G0 mice. The disease phenotype was greater in G2/G2 mice. Neither heterozygous (G1/G0 or G2/G0) risk variant mice nor hemizygous (G1/−, G2/−) mice had significant kidney injury in response to IFN-γ, although the heterozygous mice had a greater proteinuric response than the hemizygous mice, suggesting that the lack of significant disease in humans heterozygous for G1 or G2 is not due to G0 rescue of G1 or G2 toxicity. Studies using additional mice (multicopy G2 and a non-isogenic G0 mouse) supported the notion that disease is largely a function of the level of risk variant APOL1 expression. Together, these findings shed light on the recessive nature of APOL1-nephropathy and present an important model for future studies.","McCarthy, Gizelle M.; Blasio, Angelo; Donovan, Olivia G.; Schaller, Lena B.; Bock-Hughes, Althea; Magraner, Jose M.; Suh, Jung Hee; Tattersfield, Calum F.; Stillman, Isaac E.; Shah, Shrijal S.; Zsengeller, Zsuzsanna K.; Subramanian, Balajikarthick; Friedman, David J.; Pollak, Martin R.",Dis Model Mech,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8353097/,626

The behavioral bases of the decreased calorie intake remain to be elucidated. We applied the methodology of microstructural analysis of meal intake to establish the behavioral features of ingestion in an effort to discern the various controls of feeding as a function of RYGB. METHODS: The ingestive microstructure of a standardized liquid meal in a cohort of 11 RYGB patients, in 10 patients with obesity, and in 10 healthy-weight adults was prospectively assessed from baseline to 1 year with a custom-designed drinkometer. Statistics were performed on log-transformed ratios of change from baseline so that each participant served as their own control, and proportional increases and decreases were numerically symmetrical. Data-driven (3 seconds) and additional burst pause criteria (1 and 5 seconds) were used. RESULTS: At baseline, the mean meal size (909.2 versus 557.6 kCal), burst size (28.8 versus 17.6 mL), and meal duration (433 versus 381 seconds) differed between RYGB patients and healthy-weight controls, whereas suck volume (5.2 versus 4.6 mL) and number of bursts (19.7 versus 20.1) were comparable. At 1 year, the ingestive differences between the RYGB and healthy-weight groups disappeared due to significantly decreased burst size (P = 0.008) and meal duration (P = 0.034) after RYGB. The first-minute intake also decreased after RYGB (P = 0.022). CONCLUSION: RYGB induced dynamic changes in ingestive behavior over the first postoperative year. While the eating pattern of controls remained stable, RYGB patients reduced their meal size by decreasing burst size and meal duration, suggesting that increased postingestive sensibility may mediate postbariatric ingestive behavior.

58881,Loss of Smell in COVID-19 Patients: New Biomarkers,2021-10-07,"INTRODUCTION: The data on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in solid-organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) in Croatia is unknown. The aim of this study was to analyze the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Croatian SOTRs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 7 September to 27 November 2020 (beginning of the second COVID-19 pandemic wave), a cross-sectional screening for COVID-19 was performed in the adult outpatient liver (LTRs; N = 280) and kidney transplant recipients (KTRs; N = 232). Serum samples were initially tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Vircell Microbiologists, Granada, Spain). All positive samples were confirmed using a virus neutralization test (VNT). Data on risk exposure and COVID-19 related symptoms were collected using a questionnaire. RESULTS: The transplanted cohort’s seroprevalence detected by ELISA and VNT was 20.1% and 3.1%, respectively. Neutralizing (NT) antibodies developed in 15.6% of anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG positive SOTRs. The difference in seropositivity rates between LTRs and KTRs was not statistically significant (ELISA 21.1% vs. 19.0%, P = 0.554; VNT 3.6% vs. 2.6%, P = 0.082). Overall VNT positivity rates were higher in patients who reported participation in large community events (5.9% vs. 1.0%; P = 0.027) as well as in patients who reported COVID-19 related symptoms in the past six months. In addition, symptomatic VNT positive patients showed significantly higher (P = 0.031) NT antibody titers (median 128, interquartile range (IQR) = 32-128) compared to asymptomatic patients (median 16, IQR = 16-48). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that 15.6% of anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA positive Croatian SOTRs developed NT antibodies indicating protective immunity. Further studies are needed to determine the dynamic of NT antibodies and COVID-19 immunity duration in immunocompromised populations such as LTRs and KTRs.","Mrzljak, Anna; Jureković, Željka; Pavičić-Šarić, Jadranka; Stevanović, Vladimir; Tabain, Irena; Hruškar, Željka; Mikulić, Danko; Barbić, Ljubo; Vilibić-Čavlek, Tatjana",Biochem Med (Zagreb),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8495621/,626
60285,"Tackling poverty, treating obesity: a 'whole system' approach.",2020-12-21,"BACKGROUND Hemodynamic insults at arterial bifurcations are believed to play a critical role in initiating intracranial aneurysms. Recent studies in a rabbit model indicate that aneurysmal damage initiates under specific wall shear stress conditions when smooth muscle cells (SMCs) become pro-inflammatory and produce matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The mechanisms leading to SMC activation and MMP production during hemodynamic aneurysm initiation are unknown. The goal is to determine if nitric oxide and/or superoxide induce SMC changes, MMP production and aneurysmal remodeling following hemodynamic insult. METHODS Bilateral common carotid artery ligation was performed on rabbits (n = 19, plus 5 sham operations) to induce aneurysmal damage at the basilar terminus. Ligated animals were treated with the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor LNAME (n = 7) or the superoxide scavenger TEMPOL (n = 5) and compared to untreated animals (n = 7). Aneurysm development was assessed histologically 5 days after ligation. Changes in NOS isoforms, peroxynitrite, reactive oxygen species (ROS), MMP-2, MMP-9, and smooth muscle α-actin were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS LNAME attenuated ligation-induced IEL loss, media thinning and bulge formation. In untreated animals, immunofluorescence showed increased endothelial NOS (eNOS) after ligation, but no change in inducible or neuronal NOS. Furthermore, during aneurysm initiation ROS increased in the media, but not the intima, and there was no change in peroxynitrite. In LNAME-treated animals, ROS production did not change. Together, this suggests that eNOS is important for aneurysm initiation but not by producing superoxide. TEMPOL treatment reduced aneurysm development, indicating that the increased medial superoxide is also necessary for aneurysm initiation. LNAME and TEMPOL treatment in ligated animals restored α-actin and decreased MMPs, suggesting that eNOS and superoxide both lead to SMC de-differentiation and MMP production. CONCLUSION Aneurysm-inducing hemodynamics lead to increased eNOS and superoxide, which both affect SMC phenotype, increasing MMP production and aneurysmal damage.","Liaw, Nicholas; Fox, Jennifer M Dolan; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Meng, Hui; Kolega, John",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0101721; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24992254/,626

These LMs reach for new prediction frontiers at low inference costs. Here, we trained two auto-regressive models (Transformer-XL, XLNet) and four auto-encoder models (BERT, Albert, Electra, T5) on data from UniRef and BFD containing up to 393 billion amino acids. The LMs were trained on the Summit supercomputer using 5616 GPUs and TPU Pod up-to 1024 cores. Dimensionality reduction revealed that the raw protein LM-embeddings from unlabeled data captured some biophysical features of protein sequences. We validated the advantage of using the embeddings as exclusive input for several subsequent tasks. The first was a per-residue prediction of protein secondary structure (3-state accuracy Q3=81%-87%); the second were per-protein predictions of protein sub-cellular localization (ten-state accuracy: Q10=81%) and membrane vs. water soluble (2-state accuracy Q2=91%). For the per-residue predictions the transfer of the most informative embeddings (ProtT5) for the first time outperformed the state-of-the-art without using evolutionary information thereby bypassing expensive database searches.

METHODS Patients with air leaks after lung resection were randomized to treatment with pleural sealant on air leak sites after standard methods of lung closure or standard lung closure only. The primary outcome variable was the percentage of patients remaining air leak free until discharge. The secondary outcome variables were the proportion of patients with successful intraoperative air leak sealing, time to last air leak, and durations of chest tube drainage and hospitalization. RESULTS The sealant group comprised 62 subjects, and the control group comprised 59 subjects. Most patients (98.3%) underwent open lobectomy for bronchogenic carcinoma. The overall success rates for intraoperative air leak sealing were as follows: sealant group, 71.0%; control group, 23.7% (P < .001). For grade 2 and 3 air leaks (n = 77), the intraoperative sealing rates were as follows: sealant group, 71.7%; control group, 9.1% (P < .001). More patients with grade 2 and 3 air leaks had their leaks remain sealed in the sealant group (43.5% vs 15.2%, P = .013). The median time from skin closure to last observable air leak was 6 hours (sealant group) versus 42 hours (control group, P = .718). No treatment-related complications were reported. No differences in drainage or hospitalization were observed. CONCLUSIONS In this multicenter study the pleural sealant was safe and effective treatment for intraoperative air leaks after lung resection. Significantly fewer patients with surgically relevant intraoperative air leaks had postoperative air leaks when the pleural sealant was applied.","De Leyn, Paul; Muller, Michael-Rolf; Oosterhuis, Jan Wolter A; Schmid, Thomas; Choong, Cliff K C; Weder, Walter; Sokolow, Youri",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2010.09.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21093877/,626

Along with its impact on blood pressure, the renin-angiotensin system also influences a range of processes from inflammation and immune responses to longevity. Here, we review the actions of the ""classical"" renin-angiotensin system, whereby the substrate protein angiotensinogen is processed in a two-step reaction by renin and angiotensin converting enzyme, resulting in the sequential generation of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, the major biologically active renin-angiotensin system peptide, which exerts its actions via type 1 and type 2 angiotensin receptors. In recent years, several new enzymes, peptides, and receptors related to the renin-angiotensin system have been identified, manifesting a complexity that was previously unappreciated.

Wheat supplies approximately one-fifth of the calories and protein for human diets. Vertical farming is a possible promising option for increasing future wheat production. Here we show that wheat grown on a single hectare of land in a 10-layer indoor vertical facility could produce from 700 ± 40 t/ha (measured) to a maximum of 1,940 ± 230 t/ha (estimated) of grain annually under optimized temperature, intensive artificial light, high CO2 levels, and a maximum attainable harvest index. Such yields would be 220 to 600 times the current world average annual wheat yield of 3.2 t/ha. Independent of climate, season, and region, indoor wheat farming could be environmentally superior, as less land area is needed along with reuse of most water, minimal use of pesticides and herbicides, and no nutrient losses. Although it is unlikely that indoor wheat farming will be economically competitive with current market prices in the near future, it could play an essential role in hedging against future climate or other unexpected disruptions to the food system. Nevertheless, maximum production potential remains to be confirmed experimentally, and further technological innovations are needed to reduce capital and energy costs in such facilities.","Asseng, Senthold; Guarin, Jose R; Raman, Mahadev; Monje, Oscar; Kiss, Gregory; Despommier, Dickson D; Meggers, Forrest M; Gauthier, Paul P G",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2002655117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719119/,626

70819,Patient-Directed Home Drain Removal in Head and Neck Surgery.,2021-04-13,"BACKGROUND Wide acceptance of the laparoscopic approach in both benign and malignant colorectal diseases has led to the development of several multifunctional tools aiming to overcome the limitations of conventional electrosurgery (ES). The aim of this study was to compare ES, ultrasonic coagulating shears (US), electrothermal bipolar vessel sealers (EBVS), and a relatively new energy device that combines both ultrasonic and bipolar energy (Thunderbeat, TB) in terms of safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resection (LCR). MATERIALS AND METHODS A review of the literature was performed in Medline and the Cochrane Library. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies were considered for inclusion. RESULTS Four RCTs, one retrospective, and two prospective cohort studies were eligible for inclusion. Bleeding control was better with US compared with ES and operative time was shorter with both US and EBVS compared with ES. These advantages were more evident in challenging colorectal resections, such as low anterior resections. US and EBVS seemed to be more cost-effective compared with ES, although supporting data are limited. US and EBVS appeared to be equivalent with regard to different outcome parameters. Preliminary data on the efficacy and safety of TB are promising. CONCLUSION Although US and EBVS have the advantages of less blood loss and/or a shorter operative time compared with ES, the current evidence does not demonstrate which multifunctional instrument is the most effective in LCR. High-quality RCTs are required to confirm the preliminary promising results with the use of TB in LCR.","Allaix, Marco Ettore; Furnée, Edgar J B; Arezzo, Alberto; Mistrangelo, Massimiliano; Morino, Mario",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

The aim of this study was to consider the impact of COVID-19 from the perspective of Australian chaplains. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 chaplains. A grounded theory analysis identified three overarching themes: (1) a changing healthcare environment; (2) the impact of the virus; and (3) chaplains responding to the crisis. Increased healthcare restrictions in response to COVID-19 raised levels of fear and anxiety among patients, residents, family members and staff, and generated feelings of isolation and disconnection. Chaplains responded by providing a calm presence, being available, holding out hope, introducing creative ways to provide spiritual care and seeking spiritual nourishment themselves.

78014,Early Outcomes From Early Tracheostomy for Patients With COVID-19.,2020-12-17,"BACKGROUND Community acquired bacteremia (CAB) is a common cause of sepsis in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, knowledge about factors associated with outcomes of CAB in LMICs is limited. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS A prospective observational study (Ubon-sepsis) of adults admitted to a referral hospital with community-acquired infection in Northeastern Thailand was conducted between March 1, 2013 and February 1, 2017. In the present analysis, patients with a blood culture collected within 24 hours of admission that was positive for one of the three most common pathogens were studied. Clinical features, management, and outcomes of patients with each cause of CAB were compared. Of 3,806 patients presenting with community-acquired sepsis, 155, 131 and 37 patients had a blood culture positive for Escherichia coli, Burkholderia pseudomallei and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. Of these 323 CAB patients, 284 (89%) were transferred from other hospitals. 28-day mortality was highest in patients with B. pseudomallei bactaeremia (66%), followed by those with S. aureus bacteraemia (43%) and E. coli (19%) bacteraemia. In the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age, sex, transfer from another hospital, empirical antibiotics prior to or during the transfer, and presence of organ dysfunction on admission, B. pseudomallei (aHR 3.78; 95%CI 2.31-6.21) and S. aureus (aHR 2.72; 95%CI 1.40-5.28) bacteraemias were associated with higher mortality compared to E. coli bacteraemia. Receiving empirical antibiotics recommended for CAB caused by the etiologic organism prior to or during transfer was associated with survival (aHR 0.58; 95%CI 0.38-0.88). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Mortality of patients with CAB caused by B. pseudomallei was higher than those caused by S. aureus and E. coli, even after adjusting for presence of organ dysfunction on admission and effectiveness of empirical antibiotics received. Improving algorithms or rapid diagnostic tests to guide early empirical antibiotic may be key to improving CAB outcomes in LMICs.","Somayaji, Ranjani; Hantrakun, Viriya; Teparrukkul, Prapit; Wongsuvan, Gumphol; Rudd, Kristina E; Day, Nicholas P J; West, T Eoin; Limmathurotsakul, Direk",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009704; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34478439/,626

Pathogenic yield varies by clinician and/or patient characteristics. Our objectives were to determine the pathogenic yield of genetic testing, the variability in rate of pathogenic results based on subject characteristics, and the percentage of pathogenic findings resulting in further medical recommendations in toddlers with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition diagnosis of ASD. METHODS We conducted a retrospective chart review of 500 toddlers, 18 to 36 months, diagnosed with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ASD (mean age: 25.8 months, 79% male). Subject demographics, medical and neuropsychological characteristics, and genetic test results were abstracted. Genetic results were divided into negative or normal, variants of unknown significance, and pathogenic. Subject characteristics were compared across results. Manual chart review determined if further recommendations were made after pathogenic results. RESULTS Over half of subjects (59.8%, n = 299) completed genetic testing, and of those, 36 (12.0%) had pathogenic findings. There were no significant differences in Bayley Scales of Infant Development cognitive (P = .112), language (P = .898), or motor scores (P = .488) among children with negative or normal findings versus a variant of unknown significance versus pathogenic findings. Medical recommendations in response to the genetic finding were made for 72.2% of those with pathogenic results. CONCLUSIONS Our findings reinforce the importance of genetic testing for toddlers diagnosed with ASD given the 12% yield and lack of phenotypic differences between subjects with and without pathogenic findings. The majority of pathogenic results lead to further medical recommendations.","Harris, Holly K; Sideridis, Georgios D; Barbaresi, William J; Harstad, Elizabeth",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2019-3211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32938777/,626
79806,Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery and COVID-19.,2020-09-22,"COVID-19 associated coagulopathy is a dysfunction of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by significantly increased fibrinogen, D-dimer and C reactive protein and normal to near-normal prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and platelet count. Hypercoagulopathy and hypofibrinolysis coexist and are detected by viscoelastic tests. These features, when associated with immobilization and intrinsic risk factors (age, obesity, comorbidities, drugs) of the patient, can trigger thromboembolic events, despite thromboprophylaxis. The lungs are the first and most severely damaged organ. To date, most patients have exhibited hypercoagulability on viscoelastic tests not detected by standard coagulation tests. A high rate of thrombotic events was reported, suggesting that it should be considered as a cause of clinical deterioration in intensive care and potentially other clinical settings. In advanced stage, COVID-19 associated coagulopathy, fibrinogen and platelet count can decrease significantly, depending on the severity of clinical status resembling consumptive coagulopathy. In this stage, bleeding events can occur, especially if the patient is under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Viscoelastic tests are very useful tools to assess hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis (not detectable by standard coagulation tests) in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients with COVID-19 associated coagulopathy and look like very promising tools for anticoagulation management. However, further research needs to be carried out to determine whether abnormal viscoelastic tests alone or in combination with other clinical or laboratory findings can identify patients at increased thrombotic risk. Clinical trials to evaluate hypercoagulability using viscoelastic tests and the need for personalized dosage of anticoagulation in SARS-CoV-2 patientsare quickly emerging.","Rodrigues, Anabela; Seara Sevivas, Teresa; Leal Pereira, Carla; Caiado, André; Robalo Nunes, António",Acta medica portuguesa,https://doi.org/10.20344/amp.14784; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33159728/,626
80479,Short-term donor site morbidity: A comparison of the anterolateral thigh and radial forearm fasciocutaneous free flaps.,2016,"In recent years, GIS and virtual auditing have been widely used to measure the built environment, and each method carries its strengths and weaknesses. To generate higher quality, more cost-effective, and less time-consuming measures, it is necessary to explore dual- or multi-method strategy toward sampling optimization, improvement of measurement, and enhancement of efficiency. To justify the proposed dual-method approach, the study has three major objectives. First, it examines the uncertainties associated with different sample sizes by using GIS to generate scenarios that contrast the validity of measurements to aid sampling optimization in auditing. Second, it compares the validity of GIS measures with those generated through Google Street View Auditing (GSVA) by human raters. Third, it further examines the efficiency of the proposed dual-method approach in comparison to the two individual methods. Such investigation generates several novel findings. First, the study presents important evidence to support that GIS measures can offer sampling guidance applicable to the GSVA method. It leads to a recommendation of sampling sizes (5%-20%) for cases in settings with a mixture of affluent and disadvantaged neighborhoods. Results further indicate that different communities and certain individual features and characteristics may demand different sampling practices. Second, the study found that while GSVA is trustworthy for most characteristic variables, especially those that required subjective input, GIS provides well-validated measures for certain objective environmental attributes. Furthermore, the study reports that a dual-method approach of GIS and GSVA had a lower financial and time burden than using GSVA alone and is thus recommended as a comprehensive solution for optimal measurement of an objective built environment in mixed urban neighborhoods.","Li, Weimin; Winter, Patricia L; Milburn, Lee-Anne; Padgett, Pamela E",Health & place,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2020.102482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385801/,626

Urine collected from Australian pteropid bats was assessed for the presence of paramyxoviruses. One of the viruses isolated was Teviot virus (TevPV), a novel rubulavirus previously isolated from pteropid bat urine throughout the east coast of Australia. Here, we further characterize TevPV through analysis of whole-genome sequencing, growth kinetics, antigenic relatedness and the experimental infection of ferrets and mice. TevPV is phylogenetically and antigenically most closely related to Tioman virus (TioPV). Unlike many other rubulaviruses, cell receptor attachment by TevPV does not appear to be sialic acid-dependent, with the receptor for host cell entry being unknown. The infection of ferrets and mice suggested that TevPV has a low pathogenic potential in mammals. Infected ferrets seroconverted by 10 days post-infection without clinical signs of disease. Furthermore, infected ferrets did not shed virus in any respiratory secretions, suggesting a low risk of onward transmission of TevPV. No productive infection was observed in the mouse infection study.","Johnson, Rebecca I; Tachedjian, Mary; Clayton, Bronwyn A; Layton, Rachel; Bergfeld, Jemma; Wang, Lin-Fa; Marsh, Glenn A",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.001214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30688635/,626

To understand exosome-mediated improvement in cardiac function we examined the proteomic alternations in the MSC exosome-treated mice hearts subjected to left coronary artery (LCA) ligation, with particular emphasis on peri-infarct areas. At 7 days after LCA ligation, left ventricular end systolic thickness, infarct size and survival of mice were studied. Mass spectrometric analysis of infarct and peri-infarct areas was carried out. Expression of inflammatory markers (LOX-1 and NLRP3) and cell death markers (Bax, Bcl-2, Caspases 1 and 3 and GSDMD) were investigated by Western blots and immunofluorescence. Proteomic analysis of the infarct and peri-infarct areas in saline-treated hearts revealed differentially expressed proteins involved in inflammation and apoptotic cell death, while showing depletion of processes governing cell death. Exosome treatment significantly improved the proteomic profile in both infarct and peri-infarct areas, more so in the peri-infarct areas. The infarct size was smaller (9 ± 1%), and cardiac contractile function (fractional shortening) was preserved in the exosome-treated mice (28 ± 2%). Survival of exosome-treated mice was also better. White blood cell accumulation in and around the infarct area, expression of LOX-1 and NLRP3 inflammasome, and markers of cell death (cleaved Caspase-3, Caspase-1, GSDMD, Bcl-2 and Bax) were dramatically reduced by MSC exosome treatment (all p < 0.01). In cultured primary mouse cardiomyocytes, treatment with MSC exosomes essentially reversed inflammation-induced pro-apoptotic and inflammatory signals (p < 0.01). MSC exosomes exert their cardioprotective effects by suppressing inflammation and pro-apoptotic processes, particularly in the peri-infarct areas, resulting in preservation of cardiac function after LCA ligation.","Kore, Rajshekhar A; Wang, Xianwei; Ding, Zufeng; Griffin, Robert J; Tackett, Alan J; Mehta, Jawahar L",Molecular and cellular biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11010-020-04029-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423165/,626

The aim of this study was to examine levels of fear and depressive symptoms in association with COVID-19 outbreak and to assess other contributing factors in the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Link to an anonymous questionnaire, mainly based on The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (Ahorsu et al. 2020) and two-item and nine-item Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQs) (Maurer et al. 2018) (background information, fear assessment and information regarding depression) was distributed online to general population of Bosnia and Herzegovina. RESULTS Out of 1201 respondents, 217 (18.0%) reported experiencing fear and 341 (28.4%) reported having symptoms of depression during COVID-19 outbreak. The mean age of the subjects was 30.57±11.26. Being older (OR=1.044; 95% CI 1.031-1.057; p<0.001) and having moderate to severe depressive symptoms (OR=1.093; 95% CI 1.067-1.120; p<0.001) were independent significant predictors for developing fear; living in rural environment (OR=0.551; 95% Cl 0.325-0.935; p=0.0027) significantly decreased the risk of developing fear; being female (OR=1.750; 95% CI 1.242-2.466; p=0.001), unemployed (OR=1.557; 95% CI 1.040-2.330; p=0.032) or student (OR=1.943; 95% CI 1.450-2.604; p<0.001) were independent significant predictors for developing moderate to severe depressive symptoms in association with COVID-19.

108386,Time for a Paradigm Shift in Head and Neck Cancer Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-06-02,"INTRODUCTION Cachexia and sarcopenia are associated with poor outcome and increased chemotherapy-induced toxicity in lung cancer patients. However, the complex interplay of obesity, sarcopenia and cachexia, and its impact on survival in the context of first-line-chemotherapy is not yet understood. METHODS In 200 consecutively recruited lung cancer patients (70 female, mean age 62y; mean BMI 25 kg/m2; median follow-up 15.97 months) with routine staging-CT before and after chemotherapy (CTX, mean interval: 4.3 months), densitometric quantification of total (TFA), visceral (VFA), and subcutaneous-fat-area (SFA), inter-muscular-fat-area (IMFA), muscle-density (MD), muscle-area (MA) and skeletal-muscle-index (SMI) was performed retrospectively to evaluate changes under chemotherapy and the impact on survival. RESULTS We observed increases in TFA, VFA, SFA, VFA/SFA, and IMFA (p<0.05-0.001), while there were decreases in MA, MD and BMI (p<0.05-0.001) after chemotherapy. High pre-therapeutic VFA/SFA was a predictive factor for poor survival (HR = 1.272; p = 0.008), high pre-therapeutic MD for improved survival (HR = 0.93; p<0.05). Decrease in BMI (HR = 1.303; p<0.001), weight (HR = 1.067; p<0.001) and SMI (HR = 1.063; p<0.001) after chemotherapy were associated with poor survival. Patients with ≥4 CTX-cycles showed increased survival (17.6 vs. 9.1months), less muscle depletion (SMIdifference: p<0.05) and no BMI loss (BMIdifference: p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS After chemotherapy, patients exhibited sarcopenia with decreased muscle and increased adipose tissue compartments, which was not adequately mirrored by BMI and weight loss but by imaging. Particularly sarcopenic patients received less CTX-cycles and had poorer survival. As loss of BMI, weight and muscle were associated with poor survival, early detection (via imaging) and prevention (via physical exercise and nutrition) of sarcopenia may potentially improve outcome and reduce chemotherapy-induced toxicity.","Nattenmüller, Johanna; Wochner, Raoul; Muley, Thomas; Steins, Martin; Hummler, Simone; Teucher, Birgit; Wiskemann, Joachim; Kauczor, Hans-Ulrich; Wielpütz, Mark Oliver; Heussel, Claus Peter",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0169136; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28107410/,626

Our aim was to evaluate the impact of a stable, low-pressure pneumoperitoneum induced by a valve-less insufflator, on working space, hemodynamics, inflammation, and peritoneal physiology, in a model of laparoscopic sigmoid resection. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twelve pigs (47 ± 3.3 kg) were equipped for invasive hemodynamic monitoring and randomly assigned to Standard (n = 6) vs. valve-less (n = 6) insufflation. Animals were positioned in a 30° Trendelenburg on a CT scan bed. A low-pressure pneumoperitoneum (8 mmHg) was started and duration was set for 180 min. Abdominal CT scans were performed, under neuromuscular blockade, before, immediately after, and 1 and 3 h after insufflation. Pneumoperitoneum volumes were calculated on 3D reconstructed CT scans. After creation of a mesenteric window, capillary blood was obtained by puncturing the sigmoid serosa and local lactatemia (mmol/L) was measured using a handheld analyzer. Surgical resection was performed according to the level of lactates, in order to standardize bowel stump perfusion. IL-1 and IL-6 (ng/mL) were measured repeatedly. The peritoneum was sampled close to the surgical site and distantly for the oxygraphic assessment of mitochondrial respiration. A pathologist applied a semi-quantitative score to evaluate the anastomosis. RESULTS Mean arterial pressure, pulse, body temperature, oximetry, systemic lactatemia, and local lactates were similar. IL-6 was lower in the valve-less group, reaching a statistically significant difference after 3 h of insufflation (64.85 ± 32.5 vs. 133.95 ± 59.73; p = 0.038) and 48 h (77.53 ± 68.4 vs. 190.74 ± 140.79; p = 0.029). Peritoneal mitochondrial respiration was significantly increased after the survival period, with no difference among the groups. The anastomoses in the valve-less group demonstrated a lower acute (p = 0.04) inflammatory infiltration. The mean anterior posterior thickness was slightly, yet significantly higher in the valve-less group, on all post-insufflation CT scans. CONCLUSIONS Valve-less insufflation achieved a slightly higher working space and a lower systemic and localized inflammatory response in this experimental setting.","Diana, Michele; Noll, Eric; Legnèr, Andras; Kong, Seong-Ho; Liu, Yu-Yin; Schiraldi, Luigi; Marchegiani, Francesco; Bano, Jordan; Geny, Bernard; Charles, Anne-Laure; Dallemagne, Bernard; Lindner, Véronique; Mutter, Didier; Diemunsch, Pierre; Marescaux, Jacques",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-018-6039-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29330589/,626
122079,Prognostic Value of Lymph Node Yield and Density in Head and Neck Malignancies.,2018,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the sanitary measures of social distance brought impasses to Social Research and its future. Research in digital environments was already booming, but now that face-to-face activities are temporarily suspended, it becomes an alternative to enable the continuity of studies. Understanding it better is an epistemological and methodological need for all researchers. Thus, the objective of this essay is to propose some theoretical and methodological considerations on qualitative research in the different digital environments formed by the Internet 2.0. We point out some introductory aspects and tensions considered strategic for those who are going to start their work in social networks supported by the Internet. We organized the article based on the following topics: (1) digital sociality; (2) the ""digital environment"" and the blurring of boundaries between real-virtual; (3) the redefinition of the meaning of ""field"" in the digital environment; (4) the different cultural uses of digital platforms; (5) platforms as producers of discursive genres; (6) the production and extraction of collections. The essay seeks to demonstrate that research in digital environments reveals an exponential field of possibilities, whether to explore the forms that this sociality assumes in our daily lives, or to modulate our (inter)subjectivities, as it allows the production of identity narratives and performances, associations for different purposes, among many other possibilities. However, it demands an understanding of social action based on the synergy of the socio-technical-cultural contexts that structure it.","Deslandes, Suely; Coutinho, Tiago",Cadernos de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00223120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33237210/,626
130292,COVID-19 Pandemic: What Every Otolaryngologist-Head and Neck Surgeon Needs to Know for Safe Airway Management.,2020-04-14,"Bats are known to harbor a number of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic viruses, many of which are highly pathogenic in other mammals but result in no clinical symptoms in bats. The ability of bats to coexist with viruses may be the result of rapid control of viral replication early in the immune response. IFNs provide the first line of defense against viral infection in vertebrates. Type III IFNs (IFN-λs) are a recently identified IFN family that share similar antiviral activities with type I IFNs. To our knowledge, we demonstrate the first functional analysis of type III IFNs from any species of bat, with the investigation of two IFN-λ genes from the pteropid bat, Pteropus alecto. Our results demonstrate that bat type III IFN has similar antiviral activity to type I and III IFNs from other mammals. In addition, the two bat type III IFNs are differentially induced relative to each other and to type I IFNs after treatment or transfection with synthetic dsRNA. Infection with the bat paramyxovirus, Tioman virus, resulted in no upregulation of type I IFN production in bat splenocytes but was capable of inducing a type III IFN response in three of the four bats tested. To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the simultaneous suppression of type I IFN and induction of type III IFN after virus infection. These results may have important implications for the role of type III IFNs in the ability of bats to coexist with viruses.","Zhou, Peng; Cowled, Chris; Todd, Shawn; Crameri, Gary; Virtue, Elena R; Marsh, Glenn A; Klein, Reuben; Shi, Zhengli; Wang, Lin-Fa; Baker, Michelle L",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1003115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21278349/,626

Intralesional bleomycin is now commonly being used to treat such malformations. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this systematic review is to synthesize evidence on the safety and efficacy of bleomycin/pingyangmycin sclerotherapy for the treatment of orbital and peri-orbital VLM. METHODS We searched Medline, Embase, Scopus and Cochrane database for studies reporting outcomes of bleomycin/pingyangmycin sclerotherapy for orbital and peri-orbital VLM between 1974 to April 5th, 2019. Nine retrospective cohort studies enrolling 132 patients were included. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Predefined outcome measures were subjective and objective reduction of the lesion and associated complications. RESULTS Subjective reduction of the lesions was seen in 96.2% of the studies. Objective reduction of the lesion and symptomatic improvement were reported in 91.6 and 95% of the studies respectively. Non responders were 9.0%. Minor adverse events were reported in 18.1% of the studies. Major complications like pulmonary toxicity or pulmonary fibrosis was not encountered in any of the included studies. Quality of evidence was generally low. CONCLUSION Bleomycin/pingyangmycin sclerotherapy is very effective and relatively safe for the treatment of orbital and periorbital VLM and is not associated with any major side effects including pulmonary fibrosis.Limitations: The systematic review is limited mainly due to low quality of the included studies with retrospective design.","Faiz, Khunsa; Finitsis, Stephanos; Linton, Janice; Shankar, Jai Jai Shiva","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019920972514; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33175616/,626

There is increasing evidence that it has a role in cancer progression and will be a useful target for antibody-directed cancer therapies. We report a novel recombinant diabody antibody fragment that targets specifically αvβ6 and blocks its function. The diabody was engineered with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (His tag), expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified by IMAC. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis of the purified diabody showed affinity in the nanomolar range. Pre-treatment of αvβ6-expressing cells with the diabody resulted in a reduction of cell migration and adhesion to LAP, demonstrating biological function-blocking activity. After radio-labeling, using the His-tag for site-specific attachment of (99m)Tc, the diabody retained affinity and targeted specifically to αvβ6-expressing tumors in mice bearing isogenic αvβ6 +/- xenografts. Furthermore, the diabody was specifically internalized into αvβ6-expressing cells, indicating warhead targeting potential. Our results indicate that the new αvβ6 diabody has a range of potential applications in imaging, function blocking or targeted delivery/internalization of therapeutic agents.","Kogelberg, Heide; Miranda, Enrique; Burnet, Jerome; Ellison, David; Tolner, Berend; Foster, Julie; Picón, Carmen; Thomas, Gareth J; Meyer, Tim; Marshall, John F; Mather, Stephen J; Chester, Kerry",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0073260; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24023846/,626

Lung tissue examination has been largely derived from autopsy - a combination of case reports, small and moderately sized series with international scope. Common and uncommon histopathology provides insight into the progression of severe, fatal disease. RECENT FINDINGS COVID-19 lung histology is most commonly diffuse alveolar damage as part of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Lung injury can be temporally heterogeneous, with patterns of healing alongside new injury. Viral studies, including immunohistochemistry, RNA in-situ hybridization, and tissue-based Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assist in discerning complications of therapy (e.g. ventilator-associated pneumonia) from primary viral-induced injury. Response to viral infection produces systemic effects, and one major manifestation is thrombosis of micro-circulation and larger vessels. Less common patterns include neutrophil-rich inflammation, raising speculation that neutrophil extra-cellular traps may play a role in both viral control and exaggerated immune response. SUMMARY The heterogeneity of fatal cases- persistence of viral infection in lung, clearance of virus but severe lung injury, thrombosis, and exaggerated immune response - suggest that antiviral, antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and supportive therapy play a role in treatment, but that the patient-specific cause and timing of the lung injury is important in choosing intervention.","Borczuk, Alain C",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcp.0000000000000761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33399353/,626
153015,Evidence-Based Guidelines for Management of Head and Neck Mucosal Malignancies during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-04-28,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Thromboembolic complications constitute a significant source of morbidity after neurointerventional procedures. Flow diversion using the pipeline embolization device for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms necessitates the use of dual antiplatelet therapy to reduce this risk. The use of platelet function testing before pipeline embolization device placement remains controversial. METHODS A retrospective review of prospectively maintained databases at 3 academic institutions was performed from the years 2009 to 2016 to identify patients with intracranial aneurysms treated with pipeline embolization device placement. Clinical and radiographic data were analyzed with emphasis on thromboembolic complications and clopidogrel responsiveness. RESULTS A total of 402 patients underwent 414 pipeline embolization device procedures for the treatment of 465 intracranial aneurysms. Thromboembolic complications were encountered in 9.2% of procedures and were symptomatic in 5.6%. Clopidogrel nonresponders experienced a significantly higher rate of thromboembolic complications compared with clopidogrel responders (17.4% versus 5.6%). This risk was significantly lower in nonresponders who were switched to ticagrelor when compared with patients who remained on clopidogrel (2.7% versus 24.4%). In patients who remained on clopidogrel, the rate of thromboembolic complications was significantly lower in those who received a clopidogrel boost within 24 hours pre-procedure when compared with those who did not (9.8% versus 51.9%). There was no significant difference in the rate of hemorrhagic complications between groups. CONCLUSIONS Clopidogrel nonresponders experienced a significantly higher rate of thromboembolic complications when compared with clopidogrel responders. However, this risk seems to be mitigated in nonresponders who were switched to ticagrelor or received a clopidogrel boost within 24 hours pre-procedure.","Adeeb, Nimer; Griessenauer, Christoph J; Foreman, Paul M; Moore, Justin M; Shallwani, Hussain; Motiei-Langroudi, Rouzbeh; Alturki, Abdulrahman; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I; Harrigan, Mark R; Ogilvy, Christopher S; Thomas, Ajith J",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.116.015308; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28411263/,626

Such patients are often concomitantly treated with antiviral and antihypertensive agents, including ritonavir and nifedipine. Since ritonavir is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A and nifedipine is mainly metabolized via CYP3A, the combination of ritonavir and nifedipine can potentially cause drug-drug interactions. This study provides guidance on nifedipine treatment during and after co-administration with ritonavir-containing regimens, using a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) analysis. METHODS The PBPK/PD models for three formations of nifedipine were developed based on the Simcyp® nifedipine model and the models were verified using published data. The effects of ritonavir on nifedipine exposure and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were assessed for instant-release, sustained-release, and controlled-release formulations in patients. Various nifedipine regimens were investigated when co-administered with or without ritonavir. RESULTS PBPK/PD models for three formulations of nifedipine were successfully established. The predicted maximum concentration (Cmax ), area under plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), maximum reduction in SBP, and area under effect-time curve were all within 0.5-2.0-fold of the observed data. Model simulations showed that the inhibitory effect of ritonavir on CYP3A4 increased the Cmax of nifedipine 17.92-48.85-fold and the AUC 63.30-84.01-fold at steady state and decreased the SBP by more than 40 mmHg. Thus, the combination of nifedipine and ritonavir could lead to severe hypotension. CONCLUSIONS Ritonavir significantly affects the pharmacokinetics and antihypertensive effect of nifedipine. It is not recommended for patients to take nifedipine- and ritonavir-containing regimens simultaneously.","Niu, Wanjie; Li, Size; Jin, Shasha; Lin, Xiying; Zhang, Mengwan; Cai, Weimin; Xiang, Xiaoqiang; Jiao, Zheng",British journal of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.14684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33269470/,626

We analyzed data from a multicenter study of endoscopic therapy to identify factors associated with progression to high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in patients with LGD of the esophagus. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of data from 255 patients with a primary diagnosis of LGD (78% men; mean age, 63 years) who participated in a randomized controlled trial of surveillance vs radiofrequency ablation in Europe. Three expert pathologists independently reviewed baseline and subsequent LGD specimens. The presence and degree of dysplasia was separately recorded for each biopsy and classified according to the Vienna Classification system. The primary end point was development of HGD or EAC. We performed univariate logistic regression analyses to assess the association between outcomes and factors such as number of pathologists confirming LGD, multifocality of LGD, and persistence of LGD over time. RESULTS Of the 255 patients, 45 (18%) developed HGD or EAC during a median 42-month follow-up period (interquartile range, 25-61 months); patients were examined by a median 4 endoscopies (interquartile range, 3-6 endoscopies). The number of pathologists confirming LGD was strongly associated with progression to neoplasia; risk for progression increased greatly when all 3 pathologists agreed on LGD (odds ratio, 47.14; 95% confidence interval, 13.10-169.70). When LGD was detected at baseline and confirmed by a subsequent endoscopy, the odds for progression to neoplasia also increased greatly (odds ratio, 9.28; 95% confidence interval, 4.39-19.64). Multifocal LGD was not significantly associated with progression to neoplasia. CONCLUSIONS The number of pathologists confirming LGD and persistence of LGD over time increase risk for development of HGD or EAC in patients with Barrett's esophagus and LGD. These simple, readily available variables can help stratify risk and select patients for prophylactic ablation therapy.","Duits, Lucas C; van der Wel, Myrtle J; Cotton, Cary C; Phoa, K Nadine; Ten Kate, Fiebo J W; Seldenrijk, Cees A; Offerhaus, G Johan A; Visser, Mike; Meijer, Sybren L; Mallant-Hent, Rosalie C; Krishnadath, Kausilia K; Pouw, Roos E; Tijssen, Jan G P; Shaheen, Nicholas J; Bergman, Jacques J G H M",Gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2016.12.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28012849/,626

161854,Evolution of Altered Sense of Smell or Taste in Patients With Mildly Symptomatic COVID-19.,2020-07-02,"NEW FINDINGS What is the central question of this study? What is the effect of acute NO precursor intake on vascular function, muscle and cerebral oxygenation and peripheral and central neuromuscular fatigue during knee-extension exercise? What is the main finding and its importance? Acute NO precursor ingestion increases the plasma concentrations of NO precursors (nitrate, arginine and citrulline) and enhances post-ischaemic vasodilatation, but has no significant effect on muscle and cerebral oxygenation, peripheral and central mechanisms of neuromuscular fatigue and, consequently, does not improve exercise performance. ABSTRACT Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in matching blood flow to oxygen demand in the brain and contracting muscles during exercise. Previous studies have shown that increasing NO bioavailability can improve muscle function. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of acute NO precursor intake on muscle and cerebral oxygenation and on peripheral and central neuromuscular fatigue during exercise. In four experimental sessions, 15 healthy men performed a thigh ischaemia-reperfusion test followed by submaximal isometric knee extensions (5 s on-4 s off; 45% of maximal voluntary contraction) until task failure. In each session, subjects drank a nitrate-rich beetroot juice containing 520 mg nitrate (N), N and citrulline (6 g; N+C), N and arginine (6 g; N+A) or a placebo (PLA). Prefrontal cortex and quadriceps near-infrared spectroscopy parameters were monitored continuously. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and femoral nerve electrical stimulation were used to assess central and peripheral determinants of fatigue. The post-ischaemic increase in thigh blood total haemoglobin concentration was larger in N (10.1 ± 3.7 mmol) and N+C (10.9 ± 3.3 mmol) compared with PLA (8.2 ± 2.7 mmol; P < 0.05). Nitric oxide precursors had no significant effect on muscle and cerebral oxygenation or on peripheral and central mechanisms of neuromuscular fatigue during exercise. The total number of knee extensions did not differ between sessions (N, 71.9 ± 33.2; N+A, 73.3 ± 39.4; N+C, 74.6 ± 34.0; PLA, 71.8 ± 39.9; P > 0.05). In contrast to the post-ischaemic hyperaemic response, NO bioavailability in healthy subjects might not be the limiting factor for tissue perfusion and oxygenation during submaximal knee extensions to task failure.","Le Roux-Mallouf, Thibault; Laurent, Julien; Besset, Dimitri; Marillier, Mathieu; Larribaut, Julie; Belaidi, Elise; Corne, Christelle; Doutreleau, Stéphane; Verges, Samuel",Experimental physiology,https://doi.org/10.1113/ep087493; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31004378/,626

184026,Challenges in conducting post graduate otorhinolarygology-head and neck surgery specialty examination in the time of pandemic.,2021-08-01,"Cytolytic T cell responses are predicted to be biased towards membrane proteins. The peptide-binding grooves of most haplotypes of histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) are relatively hydrophobic, therefore peptide fragments derived from human transmembrane helices (TMHs) are predicted to be presented more often as would be expected based on their abundance in the proteome. However, the physiological reason of why membrane proteins might be over-presented is unclear. In this study, we show that the over-presentation of TMH-derived peptides is general, as it is predicted for bacteria and viruses and for both MHCI and MHC-II. Moreover, we show that TMHs are evolutionarily more conserved, because single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are present relatively less frequently in TMH-coding chromosomal regions compared to regions coding for extracellular and cytoplasmic protein regions. Thus, our findings suggest that both cytolytic and helper T cells respond more to membrane proteins, because these are evolutionary more conserved. We speculate that TMHs therefore are less prone to escape mutations that enable pathogens to evade T cell responses.","Bilderbeek, Richèl J.C.; Baranov, Maxim; van den Bogaart, Geert; Bianchi, Frans",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.02.441235,626
185790,Current concepts in antibiotic resistance.,2003,"Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is a new disease that emerged in Wuhan, China which spreads through close contact of people, often by small droplets produced during coughing or sneezing. Detail mechanism by which it spreads between people are under investigation. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared this disease as a pandemic after the severity of the disease increased. Many scientific reports gathered have suggested many drugs that could be potential candidates for the treatment. Although, clinical effectiveness has not been fully evaluated. In this review, we have aggregated the data from few research articles, official news websites and few review papers regarding its phylogenetic relation, genomic constitution, transmission, replication and in-silico analysis done by researchers for few potent drugs that are currently used to cure COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to Betacoronavirus genus with Genome structure consists 14 Open Reading Frames (ORFs) that encode 27 proteins. Coronavirus replicates into the host cells having unique mechanisms like ribosome frame-shifting and synthesis of genomic and sub genomic RNAs. In-silico methods have the advantage that they can make fast predictions for a large set of compounds in a high-throughput mode and also make their prediction based on the structure of a compound even before it has been synthesized. In-silico softwares have been used to find or to improve a novel bioactive compound, which may exhibit a strong affinity to a particular target in the drug development process.","Trivedi, Gauravi N.; Karlekar, Janhavi T.; Dhameliya, Hiren A.; Panchal, Hetalkumar",J.

186118,[Systematic preoperative SARS-CoV-2 screening by chest CT before urological surgery].,2020,"The glycoprotein (GP) of Ebola is the sole structural protein that forms the spikes on the viral envelope. The GP contains two subunits, GP1 and GP2, linked by a disulfide bond, which are responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively. In this study, the full length of GP gene of Ebola Zaire species, 2028 base pairs in length, was synthesized using 38 overlapping oligonucleotides by multiple rounds of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The synthesized GP gene was shown to be efficiently expressed in mammalian cells. Furthermore, an efficient HIV-based pseudotyping system was developed using the synthetic GP gene, providing a safe approach to dissecting the entry mechanism of Ebola viruses. Using this pseudotyping system and mutational analysis, the role of the charged residues in the GP2 helical regions was examined. It was found that substitutions of the most charged residues in the regions did not adversely affect GP expression, processing, or viral incorporation, however, most of the mutations greatly impaired the ability of GP to mediate efficient viral infection. These results demonstrate that these charged residues of GP2 play an important role in GP-mediated Ebola entry into its host cells. We propose that these charged residues are involved in forming the intermediate conformation(s) of GP in membrane fusion and Ebola entry.","Jiang, Haiqing; Wang, Jizhen; Manicassamy, Balaji; Manicassamy, Santhakumar; Caffrey, Michael; Rong, Lijun",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3516429/,626

Fifty farms and 709 litters of piglets were included in the study. Oocysts were detected on 70% of farms, with 187 litters infected. A litter of pigs that was positive for oocysts was significantly more likely to exhibit diarrhea than a litter that was negative [odds ratio (OR) = 4.0; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.8 to 5.8; P < 0.001]. Management and housing factors were examined with respect to risk factors for the presence of I. suis. Farms that did not use a detergent when cleaning farrowing crates were 10-times more likely to be positive for I. suis than those that used a detergent (P = 0.007).

The psychometric properties aspects of COVID-19 patients without comorbidities in the short term after discharge have not been reported. In this study, the Short Form 36 (SF-36) was used to evaluate the psychometric properties and to find relevant risk factors. Methods: The study was conducted in seven hospitals from January 2020 to April 2020. The SF-36 questionnaire was administered one month after discharge. Univariate analysis and multivariate regression model were used to analyze the risk factors of psychometric properties impairment. Results: In univariate analysis of independent risk factors, according to the comparison of whether the duration of positive nucleic acid was greater than 20 days, the positive nucleic acid duration was independently related to the decreased role-emotional value [100, IQR (66-100) vs 100, IQR (0, 100); p = 0.0156]. In addition, multivariable linear regression model showed that male sex and positive nucleic acid duration were related to decreased role-emotional value (p = 0.03< 0.05; p = 0.01< 0.05, respectively). Mental health was associated with age (p= 0.0435). Subsequently, we divided into three subgroups: less than seven days, 7 to 14 days and more than 14 days according to the positive nucleic acid duration. The results revealed that there were significant differences in the vitality value and mental health value of patients aged 46 to 69 in the subgroup where the positive nucleic acid duration longer than 14 days (p= 0.0472; p= 0.0311< 0.05, respectively). Similarly, there are also significant differences in role-emotional value in different genders (p= 0.0316). Conclusion: The study described the psychometric properties of COVID-19 patients without comorbidities shortly after discharge. Risk factors for psychometric properties damage included age, male sex, and nucleic acid duration.","Guo, Lei; Lin, Jingjing; Ying, Weiyang; Zheng, Chanfan; Tao, Linshuang; Ying, Binyu; Cheng, Bihuan; Jin, Shengwei; Hu, Beilei",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,,626
209116,Shared Decision-making and Stakeholder Engagement in COVID-19 Tracheostomy,2021,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing ""coronavirus disease 19"" (COVID-19) pandemic has had a strong effect on the delivery of surgical care worldwide. Elective surgeries have been canceled or delayed in order to reallocate resources to the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Currently, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on bariatric and metabolic surgical practice remains unclear. METHODS: An internet-based online survey was performed among bariatric surgeons worldwide. The survey was sent to bariatric surgeons via the International Bariatric Club Facebook group and by electronic mail via the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and metabolic disorders (IFSO) secretariat to members of the associated national IFSO societies. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-nine (n = 169) bariatric surgeons participated in the survey. The majority of the respondents postponed preoperative upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopies, appointments in the outpatient clinic and bariatric operations. Most surgeons performed video calls for follow-up appointments instead of meeting the patients in the outpatient clinics. Laparoscopy was still the preferred treatment for surgical emergencies, but a trend towards conservative treatment of acute appendicitis and acute cholecystitis was shown. Rapid preoperative COVID-19 testing availability was poor; therefore, routine screening of emergency bariatric cases was not widely provided. A wide variance occurred regarding precautions and personal protection equipment among the participants. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic showed a strong impact on bariatric surgical practice regarding surgical and outpatient planning as well as personnel management. Coordinated effort from the national bariatric societies should focus on strict implementation of the current recommendations regarding precaution measures and personal protection equipment. Further studies should evaluate how this impact will evolve in the near future.","Lazaridis, Ioannis I; Kraljevic, Marko; Schneider, Romano; Klasen, Jennifer M; Schizas, Dimitrios; Peterli, Ralph; Kow, Lilian; Delko, Tarik",Obes Surg,,626
209458,Olfactory Dysfunction Among Asymptomatic Patients with SARS CoV2 Infection: A Case-Control Study,2021,"Caffeic acid is a phenolic compound widely found in commonly consumed foods such as pears, apples and coffee, and is pharmacologically known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-asthmatic properties. However, its relaxant activity in the aorta, uterus and ileum smooth muscle has not been investigated. This study aimed to comparatively evaluate the effect of caffeic acid on smooth muscle from different organs (aorta, uterus and ileum), and the contractions of this different organ were induced by different agonists. The organ bath technique was used, where the organs were placed in different cuvettes with 10â¯mL of Tyrode solution for 1â¯h to stabilize, then, myometrial, intestinal strip and aortic ring contractions were evoked using different contractile agonists (KCl 60â¯mM, PHE, OT 10-2 IU/mL, CCh 10-6â¯M and BaCl2 0.1-30â¯mM); increasing concentrations of caffeic acid (0.03-7â¯mM) were administered in the experimental preparations. In the presence of KCl (60â¯mM), caffeic acid caused relaxations with the following EC50 values: 2.7â¯±â¯0.26â¯mM/mL (aorta), 5.7â¯±â¯0.71â¯mM/mL (uterus) and 2.1â¯±â¯0.39â¯mM/mL (ileum). When in the presence of different agonists, PHE (0.1â¯µM) for the aorta, OT (10-2 IU/mL) for the uterus and CCh (10-6â¯M) for the ileum, caffeic acid caused relaxations with EC50 values of: 2.7â¯±â¯0.31â¯mM/mL; 2.2â¯±â¯0.34â¯mM/mL and 2.0â¯±â¯5.3â¯mM/mL, respectively. The inhibitory effect of caffeic acid on serotonergic (aorta and uterus) and muscarinic receptors (uterus and ileum), as well as its possible involvement with L-type Ca2+ channels, was also observed. This study reports the pharmacological characterization of caffeic acid on smooth muscle from different organs, for which caffeic acid was more potent in the ileum. A diverse understanding of its performance as a possible therapeutic product is attributed to its relaxant effect.","de Alencar Silva, Andressa; Pereira-de-Morais, Luís; Rodrigues Silva, Renata Evaristo; de Menezes Dantas, Débora; Brito Milfont, Cícera Georgia; Gomes, Maria Franciele; Araújo, Isaac Moura; Kerntopf, Marta Regina; Alencar de Menezes, Irwin Rose; Barbosa, Roseli",Chem Biol Interact,,626
218537,Protecting medical staff from skin injury/disease caused by personal protective equipment during epidemic period of COVID-19: experience from China,2020,"PURPOSE: The coronavirus-induced pandemic has put great pressure on health systems worldwide. Nonemergency health services, such as cancer screening, have been scaled down or withheld as a result of travel restrictions and resources being redirected to manage the pandemic. The present article discusses the challenges to cancer screening implementation in the pandemic environment, suggesting ways to optimize services for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening. METHODS: The manuscript was drafted by a team of public health specialists with expertise in implementation and monitoring of cancer screening. A scoping review of literature revealed the lack of comprehensive guidance on continuation of cancer screening in the midst of waxing and waning of infection. The recommendations in the present article were based on the advisories issued by different health agencies and professional bodies and the authors' understanding of the best practices to maintain quality-assured cancer screening. RESULTS: A well-coordinated approach is required to ensure that essential health services such as cancer management are maintained and elective services are not threatened, especially because of resource constraints. In the context of cancer screening, a few changes in invitation strategies, screening and management protocols and program governance need to be considered to fit into the new normal situation. Restoring public trust in providing efficient and safe services should be one of the key mandates for screening program reorganization. This may be a good opportunity to introduce innovations (eg, telehealth) and consider de-implementing non-evidence-based practices. It is necessary to consider increased spending on primary health care and incorporating screening services in basic health package. CONCLUSION: The article provides guidance on reorganization of screening policies, governance, implementation, and program monitoring.","Basu, Partha; Alhomoud, Samar; Taghavi, Katayoun; Carvalho, Andre L; Lucas, Eric; Baussano, Iacopo",JCO Glob Oncol,,626

225603,An Integrated Care Strategy for the Follow-up of Patients With COVID-19-Associated Chemosensory Dysfunction,2020,"Abstract This paper analytically examines the demand for surgical masks following the recent health precautions due to coronavirus. Using a simple linear demand curve and alternatively examining the impacts of requirements that mandate (a) the wearing of masks by frontline workers;(b) suggested but not required masking by the whole public;and (c) compulsory masking by the whole public. The impacts of the different scenarios on the price elasticity of demand are determined along with the slope (or the rate of change) of elasticity. Some of these results differ when a non-linear demand curve is considered instead. The equilibrium mask prices increase when masks are universally mandated, whereas the consumer surplus is higher when masks are recommended but not mandated. However, the ranking of consumer surplus is shown to be sensitive to the supply elasticity of masks. These considerations enable a structured means to view the demand implications of masking requirements and provide some food for policy thought.","Goel, Rajeev K.; Haruna, Shoji",Metroeconomica,,626

Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from March 2020 to April 2020. The nurses working in Wuhan from the other parts of China were the target population. The Professional Quality of Life Scale version 5, the Hospital Ethical Climate Survey, and a basic information sheet were used to collect data. Descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and multiple linear regression analysis were used to analyze the data. Results In total, 236 nurses participated in this study, and 219 valid questionnaires were analyzed. The average age of the participants was 31.2 ± 5.0 years. Most nurses were female (176/219;80.4%) and married (145/219;66.2%). In term of professional quality of life, nurses reported moderate (129/219;58.9%) to high (90/219;41.1%) levels of compassion satisfaction, low (119/219;54.3%) to moderate (100/219;45.7%) levels of burnout, and low (67/219;36.0%) to high (10/219;4.6%) levels of secondary traumatic stress. Regarding hospital ethical climate, nurses reported moderately high hospital ethical climates with an average score of 4.46. After controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, the multiple linear regression models showed that the hospital ethical climate subscale of “relationship with physicians” was independently associated with the compassion satisfaction (β = 0.533, P &lt; 0.01) and burnout (β = −0.237, P &lt; 0.05);the hospital ethical climate subscale of “relationship with peers” (β = −0.191, P &lt; 0.01) was independently associated with the secondary traumatic stress. Conclusions During the early stage of the pandemic, nurses demonstrated moderate to high level of compassion satisfaction, low to moderate level of burnout, and all nurses experienced secondary traumatic stress. Nurses perceived a high level of hospital ethical climate, and the perceived hospital ethical climate played an important role in promoting nurses’ professional quality of life during a life-threatening infectious disease pandemic.","Jiang, Wenjing Zhao Xing039; e, Jiang Jia Zhou Qidi Yang Jiahui Chen Yuqing Goldsamt Lloyd Williams Ann Bartley Li Xianhong",International Journal of Nursing Sciences,,626
232149,Recommendations from the Canadian Association of Head and Neck Surgical Oncology for the Management of Head and Neck Cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by various pathogenic microorganisms is ubiquitous in the parts of the urinary system such as kidney, ureter, bladder, and urethra. Currently, clinical detection of UTI is mainly focused on urine culture; however, the diagnostic value of urine culture remains limited due to the time-consuming procedure and low detection rate, especially in patients who have used antibiotics. Generally, treatment for UTI relies on empirical medication rather than pathogen diagnosis, which leads to the inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents and a significant increase in resistant strains. Comparatively, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is capable of overcoming the disadvantages of clinical culture, and identifying pathogens for further treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: A 33-year-old male patient was admitted to hospital with a high fever and chills. None of his autoimmune disease or thyroid function related indicators were positive, and he had no risk of endocarditis. His white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, interleukin 6, and neutrophil proportion were markedly elevated. He was initially diagnosed as having an infection of unknown etiology. Since empirical treatment of Sulperazon and Metronidazole did not relieve his symptoms, both the blood and urine specimens were examined using traditional culture, serological testing, and mNGS assay. Traditional culture and serological testing produced negative results, while the mNGS assay revealed the presence of a potential pathogen, Enterococcus faecalis, in the urine specimen, which was further confirmed by both Sanger sequencing and qPCR analysis. A CT scan of the patient's whole abdomen showed stones in the right kidney. Once targeted antibiotic therapy was administered, the patient recovered quickly. CONCLUSIONS: Our case illustrated that mNGS, as a novel culture-independent approach, demonstrated the capability of rapid, sensitive, and accurate pathogen identification. Furthermore, this technology provides strong support for guiding clinicians to determine appropriate treatment.","Li, Manshi; Yang, Fuhuo; Lu, Yihan; Huang, Weifeng",BMC Infect Dis,,626
234983,Stigmatic Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Head & Neck Cancers Survivors,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in December 2019, more than 8 million cases have occurred worldwide as of June 16, 2020. However, it is important to distinguish COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases, such as influenza. Here, we comparatively described the clinical characteristics of children with COVID-19 and paediatric patients with influenza. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-centre study, we reviewed the electronic medical records of 585 paediatric patients with COVID-19 or influenza in Wuhan Children's Hospital, China. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics, laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes were comparatively analysed. RESULTS: The median ages were 6.96 years (IQR, 2-10.81) for children with confirmed COVID-19, 2.67 years (IQR, 1.03-15.25) for those with influenza A and 3.67 years (IQR, 1.62-5.54) for those with influenza B. Fever was a symptom in 84 (34.7%) COVID-19 cases, 132 (70.21%) influenza A cases and 111 (74.50%) influenza B cases. The median length of stay (LOS) was 11 (8-15) days for paediatric COVID-19 patients, 4 (3-6) days for influenza A patients and 5 (3-6) days for influenza B patients. Twenty-six (13.98%) influenza A patients and 18 (12.59%) influenza B patients presented with decreased white blood cell counts, while 13 (5.33%) COVID-19 patients presented with decreased white blood cell counts. Eight (3.28%) COVID-19 patients, 23 (12.71%) influenza A patients and 21 (14.79%) influenza B patients experienced lymphocytopenia. Acute cardiac injury occurred in 18 (7.29%) COVID-19 patients, while 37 (19.68%) influenza A and 27 (18.12%) influenza B patients had acute cardiac injury. CONCLUSION: In this study, the illnesses of children with COVID-19 were demonstrated to be less severe than those of paediatric patients with influenza, and COVID-19 patients had milder illness and fewer complications.","Liu, Xinghua; Li, Wei; Zhang, Bo; Guo, Yan; Hu, Zhao; Peng, Cao; Lei, Xiao; Luo, Qunying; Zhang, Qiong; Deng, Wei; Wang, Juanjuan; Tang, Jianqiao; Li, Yunqiao; Chen, Jianying",BMC Infect Dis,,626

Here, three commercially available assays with widespread distribution capabilities are compared. A total of 667 specimens, 103 from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and 564 collected prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, were analyzed in parallel using the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody and Abbott Alinity SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays; a subset of 55 samples from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections was additionally evaluated using the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgM assay. Qualitative percent agreement between the Abbott IgG and Roche total antibody assays was 98.7% (658/667), with Cohen's kappa 0.919 (95% CI 0.867-0.972). Qualitative percent agreement with the Abbott IgM assay was 92.7% (51/55, Abbott IgG) and 85.5% (47/55, Roche total antibody). Diagnostic specificities determined using pre-COVID-19 samples for the Abbott IgG and Roche total antibody assays were 99.65% (95% CI 98.72-99.90%) and 100.00% (95% CI 99.32-100.00%), respectively, spanning claims made by each manufacturer. Diagnostic sensitivities increased for all three assays with increasing time since the onset of symptoms. Among 51 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, 23 (45.1%), 24 (47.1%), and 22 (43.1%) were reactive by the Abbott IgG, Roche total antibody, and Abbott IgM assays, respectively, with sampling times 0-56 days post-positive PCR (median/mean 2/6.2 days). Combining IgG and IgM screening identified 4/55 additional samples with detectable antibodies that would not have been observed using the assays independently. Notably, one immunocompromised patient with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection showed no detectable antibodies using any of the three assays 43 days after onset of symptoms.","Harley, Kellisha; Gunsolus, Ian",J. clin. microbiol,,626
242311,Error in the Affiliations,2020,"PURPOSE: To explore the dynamic changes and correlation between CT imaging manifestations and cellular immunity of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective review analyzed 23 patients with COVID-19, including 13 males and 10 females aged 27-70 years, with an average age of 48 years. Patients were divided into two groups: group A with 11 critical-severe patients, and group B with 12 common-mild patients. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: LYM, LYM (%), CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ decreased, while NEU (%), CRP, and CT scores increased in all patients, WBC in group A increased. In group A, on day 10-12 after disease onset, CT scores and CRP reached the highest point, and day 13-15 LYM, LYM (%) reached the lowest but NEU (%) and WBC reached the highest, CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ were at the lowest on day 10-15. In group B, on day 7-9, CT scores, NEU (%) and CRP reached the peak, but LYM, LYM (%), CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ reached the lowest. In all patients, CT scores had a significantly negative correlation with CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, LYM (%), and LYM (p = 0.001, r = - 0.797; p = 0.008, r = - 0.698; p = 0.002, r = - 0.775; p < 0.001, r = - 0.785; p = 0.021, r = - 0.571, respectively), and a significantly positive correlation with WBC and NEU (%) (p < 0.001, r = 0.785; p = 0.003, r = 0.691, respectively).

244718,Factors Associated With Intubation and Prolonged Intubation in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Viral respiratory infections are the main causes of asthma exacerbation. The susceptibility of patients with asthma to develop an exacerbation when they present with severe pneumonia due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the characteristics and outcomes of asthmatic patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia who required hospitalisation during the spring 2020 outbreak in Paris, France. METHODS: A prospective cohort follow-up was carried out from 15 March to 15 April 2020 in Bicêtre Hospital, University Paris-Saclay, France. All hospitalised patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection who reported a history of asthma were included. RESULTS: Among 768 hospitalised patients, 37 (4.8%) reported a history of asthma, which had been previously confirmed by a pulmonologist in 85% of cases. These asthmatic patients were mainly female (70%) and nonsmokers (85%), with a median age of 54â years (interquartile range (IQR) 42-67â years). None of them presented with an asthma exacerbation. 22 (59%) had major comorbidities and 31 (84%) had a body mass index &#8805;25â kg·m-2. The most common comorbidities were obesity (36%), hypertension (27%) and diabetes (19%). All patients had a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia on computed tomography of the chest. Eosinopenia was a typical biological feature with a median count of 0â cells·mm-3 (IQR 0-0â cells·mm-3). 11 patients (30%) were admitted into the intensive care unit, with three deaths (8.1%) occurring in the context of comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Asthma patients were not overrepresented among those with severe pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection who required hospitalisation. The worst outcomes were observed mainly in patients with major comorbidities.","Beurnier, Antoine; Jutant, Etienne-Marie; Jevnikar, Mitja; Boucly, Athénaïs; Pichon, Jérémie; Preda, Mariana; Frank, Marie; Laurent, Jérémy; Richard, Christian; Monnet, Xavier; Duranteau, Jacques; Harrois, Anatole; Chaumais, Marie-Camille; Bellin, Marie-France; Noël, Nicolas; Bulifon, Sophie; Jaïs, Xavier; Parent, Florence; Seferian, Andrei; Savale, Laurent; Sitbon, Olivier; Montani, David; Humbert, Marc",Eur. respir. j,,626

Several classification systems for the severity of endometriosis have been proposed. Of these, the revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine classification is the most well-known. The ENZIAN classification was developed to classify deep infiltrating endometriosis and focused on the retroperitoneal structures. The endometriosis fertility index was developed to predict the fertility outcomes in patients who underwent surgery for endometriosis. Finally, the American Association of Gynecological Laparoscopists classification is currently being developed, for which 30 endometriosis experts are analyzing and researching data by assigning scores to categories considered important; however, it has not yet been fully validated and published. Currently, none of the classification systems are considered the gold standard.

However, the merits of broadly targeting S versus focusing antibody onto the smaller receptor binding domain (RBD) are unclear. Here we assess prototypic S and RBD subunit vaccines in homologous or heterologous prime-boost regimens in mice and non-human primates. We find S is highly immunogenic in mice, while the comparatively poor immunogenicity of RBD is associated with limiting germinal centre and T follicular helper cell activity. Boosting S-primed mice with either S or RBD significantly augments neutralising titres, with RBD-focussing driving moderate improvement in serum neutralisation. In contrast, both S and RBD vaccines are comparably immunogenic in macaques, eliciting serological neutralising activity that generally exceed levels in convalescent humans. These studies confirm recombinant S proteins as promising vaccine candidates and highlight multiple pathways to achieving potent serological neutralisation.","Tan, Hyon-Xhi; Juno, Jennifer A; Lee, Wen Shi; Barber-Axthelm, Isaac; Kelly, Hannah G; Wragg, Kathleen M; Esterbauer, Robyn; Amarasena, Thakshila; Mordant, Francesca L; Subbarao, Kanta; Kent, Stephen J; Wheatley, Adam K",Nat Commun,,626

297404,"Corrigendum to ""Factors Associated With Intubation and Prolonged Intubation in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19""",2020,"BACKGROUND: In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, access to surgical care for patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) is limited and unpredictable. Determining which patients should be prioritized is inherently subjective and difficult to assess. The authors have proposed an algorithm to fairly and consistently triage patients and mitigate the risk of adverse outcomes. METHODS: Two separate expert panels, a consensus panel (11 participants) and a validation panel (15 participants), were constructed among international HNC surgeons. Using a modified Delphi process and RAND Corporation/University of California at Los Angeles methodology with 4 consensus rounds and 2 meetings, groupings of high-priority, intermediate-priority, and low-priority indications for surgery were established and subdivided. A point-based scoring algorithm was developed, the Surgical Prioritization and Ranking Tool and Navigation Aid for Head and Neck Cancer (SPARTAN-HN). Agreement was measured during consensus and for algorithm scoring using the Krippendorff alpha. Rankings from the algorithm were compared with expert rankings of 12 case vignettes using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. RESULTS: A total of 62 indications for surgical priority were rated. Weights for each indication ranged from -4 to +4 (scale range; -17 to 20). The response rate for the validation exercise was 100%. The SPARTAN-HN demonstrated excellent agreement and correlation with expert rankings (Krippendorff alpha, .91 [95% CI, 0.88-0.93]; and rho, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.45-0.95]). CONCLUSIONS: The SPARTAN-HN surgical prioritization algorithm consistently stratifies patients requiring HNC surgical care in the COVID-19 era. Formal evaluation and implementation are required. LAY SUMMARY: Many countries have enacted strict rules regarding the use of hospital resources during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Facing delays in surgery, patients may experience worse functional outcomes, stage migration, and eventual inoperability. Treatment prioritization tools have shown benefit in helping to triage patients equitably with minimal provider cognitive burden. The current study sought to develop what to the authors' knowledge is the first cancer-specific surgical prioritization tool for use in the COVID-19 era, the Surgical Prioritization and Ranking Tool and Navigation Aid for Head and Neck Cancer (SPARTAN-HN). This algorithm consistently stratifies patients requiring head and neck cancer surgery in the COVID-19 era and provides evidence for the initial uptake of the SPARTAN-HN.","de Almeida, John R; Noel, Christopher W; Forner, David; Zhang, Han; Nichols, Anthony C; Cohen, Marc A; Wong, Richard J; McMullen, Caitlin; Graboyes, Evan M; Divi, Vasu; Shuman, Andrew G; Rosko, Andrew J; Lewis, Carol M; Hanna, Ehab Y; Myers, Jeffrey; Paleri, Vinidh; Miles, Brett; Genden, Eric; Eskander, Antoine; Enepekides, Danny J; Higgins, Kevin M; Brown, Dale; Chepeha, Douglas B; Witterick, Ian J; Gullane, Patrick J; Irish, Jonathan C; Monteiro, Eric; Goldstein, David P; Gilbert, Ralph",Cancer,,626

During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Nigeria, couples were compelled to spend more time together, regardless of their pre-existing challenges. Our study aims to determine the prevalence of IPV, its forms, and mental health implications among Nigerian households amid the COVID-19 lockdown. A cross-sectional study was implemented which used the snowball sampling technique to recruit 474 participants across 31 states in Nigeria. A semi-structured online questionnaire was distributed using the WhatsApp platform. The relationship between IPV, its forms, and associated factors were analyzed using descriptive analysis and logistic regression with significant value at p &#8804; .05 and confidence interval of 95%. Majority (98.1%) of the participants had at least a college degree and 90.1% were employed. Overall prevalence of IPV ranged from 7.2% to 13.5%. Using the lockdown as the landmark, higher prevalence was found before than during the lockdown across physical, emotional, financial, and sexual forms of IPV. Emotional form had the highest prevalence both before and during the lockdown with 11.4% and 3.8% respectively. Furthermore, 22.6% of participants reported that the lockdown affected their mental health. Hopelessness, feelings of failure, being irritable, and constantly under strain were psychological symptoms significantly associated with IPV amid the lockdown. Decreased prevalence of IPV were found in the early phase of the pandemic, suggesting that couples can experience less partner violence during periods of confinement. Our study supports existing evidence that forms of IPV have negative mental health consequences on abused partners.","Ojeahere, Margaret Isioma; Kumswa, Sahmicit Kankemwa; Adiukwu, Frances; Plang, Janet Punyit; Taiwo, Yetunde Folake",J Interpers Violence,,626

However, it is not clear how SARS-CoV-2 can cause neurological dysfunctions and which molecular processes are affected in the brain. In this work, we examined the frontal cortex tissue of patients who died of COVID-19 for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, comparing qRT-PCR with ddPCR. We also investigated the transcriptomic profile of frontal cortex from COVID-19 patients and matched controls by RNA-seq analysis to characterize the transcriptional signature. Our data showed that SARS-CoV-2 could be detected by ddPCR in 8 (88%) of 9 examined samples while by qRT-PCR in one case only (11%). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that 11 genes (10 mRNAs and 1 lncRNA) were differential expressed when frontal cortex of COVID-19 patients were compared to controls. These genes fall into categories including hypoxia, hemoglobin-stabilizing protein, hydrogen peroxide processes. This work demonstrated that the quantity of viral RNA in frontal cortex is minimal and it can be detected only with a very sensitive method (ddPCR). Thus, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 does not actively infect and replicate in the brain; its topography within encephalic structures remains uncertain. Moreover, COVID-19 may have a role on brain gene expression, since we observed an important downregulation of genes associated to hypoxia inducting factor system (HIF) that may inhibit the capacity of defense system during infection and oxigen deprivation, showing that hypoxia, well known multi organ condition associated to COVID-19, also marked the brain.","Gagliardi, Stella; Emanuele Poloni, Tino; Pandini, Cecilia; Garofalo, Maria; Dragoni, Francesca; Medici, Valentina; Davin, Annalisa; Damiana Visonà, Silvia; Moretti, Matteo; Sproviero, Daisy; Pansarasa, Orietta; Guaita, Antonio; Ceroni, Mauro; Tronconi, Livio; Cereda, Cristina",Brain behav. immun,,626

The array design and application based on flexible strain sensors have been the current research hotspots. However, there are few reports on research of acoustic positioning using the flexible sensor array. Herein, we designed and realized the consistent fabrication of a thin-film, acoustic sensor array. The acoustic sensing research of the sensor was demonstrated as well. We used a convenient fabrication method to design a flexible acoustic sensor using silver nanowires coated on a thin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film with mass block-beam structure. The acoustic sensor can record sound within a frequency domain of 20-2000 Hz and volume detection range of 83-108 dB. The sensor's resonance frequency is 380 Hz, horizontal distance sound detection limit is 5 cm, and vertical detection limit is 3.5 cm. We also achieved 360° azimuth detection in two-dimensional space with a detection accuracy of 15°. In three-dimensional space, the flexible acoustic sensor array was designed with two flexible acoustic sensors to detect the position of the sound source. This research first proposes the use of flexible acoustic sensors to test the sound source orientation.","Zhang, Qiang; Ji, Chao; Lv, Licheng; Zhao, Dong; Ji, Jianlong; Zhuo, Kai; Yuan, Zhongyun; Zhang, Wendong; Sang, Shengbo",Soft robot.

METHODS: Retrospective, observational, consecutive case series of patients admitted with ICH to Maimonides Medical Center from March 1 through July 31, 2020, who had confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, and outcome data were analyzed. ICH rates among all strokes were compared to the same time period in 2019 in two-week time intervals. Correlation of systolic blood pressure variability (SBPV) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) to clinical outcomes were performed. RESULTS: Of 324 patients who presented with stroke, 65 (20%) were diagnosed with non-traumatic ICH: 8 had confirmed and 3 had highly suspected COVID-19. Nine (82%) had at least one associated risk factor for ICH. Three ICHs occurred during inpatient anticoagulation. More than half (6) suffered either deep or cerebellar hemorrhages; only 2 were lobar hemorrhages. Two of 8 patients with severe pneumonia survived. During the NYC COVID-19 peak period in April, ICH comprised the highest percentage of all strokes (40%), and then steadily decreased week-after-week (pâ¯=â¯0.02). SBPV and NLR were moderately and weakly positively correlated to discharge modified Rankin Scale, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 associated ICH is often associated with at least one known ICH risk factor and severe pneumonia. There was a suggestive relative surge in ICH among all stroke types during the first peak of the NYC pandemic. It is important to be vigilant of ICH as a possible and important manifestation of COVID-19.","Mishra, Sanskriti; Choueka, Murray; Wang, Qiang; Hu, Chloe; Visone, Stephanie; Silver, Michael; Stein, Evan G; Levine, Steven R; Wang, Qingliang T",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,626

350978,CSO (Canadian Society of Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery) position paper on return to Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery Clinic Practice during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada,2020,"BACKGROUND: Technologies allowing home-based rehabilitation may be a key means of saving financial resources while also facilitating people's access to treatment. After cochlear implantation, auditory training is necessary for the brain to adapt to new auditory signals transmitted by the cochlear implant (CI). To date, auditory training is conducted in a face-to-face setting at a specialized center. However, because of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on health care, the need for new therapeutic settings has intensified. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to assess the feasibility of a novel teletherapeutic auditory rehabilitation platform in adult CI recipients and compare the clinical outcomes and economic benefits of this platform with those derived from conventional face-to-face rehabilitation settings in a clinic. METHODS: In total, 20 experienced adult CI users with a mean age of 59.4 (SD 16.3) years participated in the study. They completed 3 weeks of standard (face-to-face) therapy, followed by 3 weeks of computer-based auditory training (CBAT) at home. Participants were assessed at three intervals: before face-to-face therapy, after face-to-face therapy, and after CBAT. The primary outcomes were speech understanding in quiet and noisy conditions. The secondary outcomes were the usability of the CBAT system, the participants' subjective rating of their own listening abilities, and the time required for completing face-to-face and CBAT sessions for CI users and therapists. RESULTS: Greater benefits were observed after CBAT than after standard therapy in nearly all speech outcome measures. Significant improvements were found in sentence comprehension in noise (P=.004), speech tracking (P=.004) and phoneme differentiation (vowels: P=.001; consonants: P=.02) after CBAT. Only speech tracking improved significantly after conventional therapy (P=.007). The program's usability was judged to be high: only 2 of 20 participants could not imagine using the program without support. The different features of the training platform were rated as high. Cost analysis showed a cost difference in favor of CBAT: therapists spent 120 minutes per week face-to-face and 30 minutes per week on computer-based sessions. For CI users, attending standard therapy required an average of approximately 78 (SD 58.6) minutes of travel time per appointment. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed teletherapeutic approach for hearing rehabilitation enables good clinical outcomes while saving time for CI users and clinicians. The promising speech understanding results might be due to the high satisfaction of users with the CBAT program. Teletherapy might offer a cost-effective solution to address the lack of human resources in health care as well as the global challenge of current or future pandemics.","Völter, Christiane; Stöckmann, Carolin; Schirmer, Christiane; Dazert, Stefan",JMIR Rehabil Assist Technol,,626

In particular, “mobile positioning data” are increasingly being used to study population movements and population distributions. However, the legal, ethical, and technical complexities of working with this type of data often pose many barriers, which can prevent the data from being used at the times when it is most urgently needed. We demonstrate how having a robust public–private partnership framework, a privacy-preserving technical setup, and a communications strategy already in place, prior to an emergency, can enable governments to harness the advantages of telecommunications data at the times when it is most valuable. However, even once these foundations are in place, the challenges of competing priorities, managing expectations, and maintaining communication with data consumers during a pandemic mean that the potential of the data is not automatically translated into direct impact. This highlights the importance of sensitisation exercises, targeted at potential data users, to make clear the potential and limitations of the data, as well as the importance of being able to maintain direct communication with data users.

However, the screening of TCM is limited by the development cycle and laboratory conditions, which greatly limits the screening speed. This study established optimization docking models and virtual screening to discovery potential active herbs for the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus based on molecular docking technology. The crystal structures of 3 CL protease(Mpro) and papain-like protease(PLP) were obtained from PDB database and homologous modeling respectively, and were used to conduct virtual screening of TCMD 2009 database by CDOCKER program. The ingredients scored in the top 100 were selected respectively, and the candidate herbs were ranked by the numbers of hit molecules. Based on Mpro inhibitors screening, 12 322 potential active components were obtained, and the representative active components included aster pentapeptide A, ligustrazine, salvianolic acid B, etc., and Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, Asteris Radix et Rhizoma, Notoginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Chuanxiong Rhizoma, Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Zingiberis Rhizoma, Dianthi Herba, Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, Cistanches Herba were obtained. While 11 294 potential active ingredients were obtained by PLP inhibitor screening, representative active ingredients included gingerketophenol, ginkgol alcohol, ferulic acid, etc., and Codonopsis Radix, Notopterygii Rhizoma et Radix, Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, Ginkgo Semen, Chuanxiong Rhizoma, Trichosanthis Fructus, Paeoniae Radix Alba, Psoraleae Fructus, Sophorae Flavescentis Radix, Notoginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Angelicae Sinensis Radix were chosen.

The reasons remain to be fully elucidated. Objective: To compare and evaluate the effectiveness of case-based (including contact tracing and quarantine) and population-based (including social distancing and facial masking) interventions for COVID-19 in Taiwan. Design, Setting, and Participants: This comparative effectiveness study used a stochastic branching process model using COVID-19 epidemic data from Taiwan, an island nation of 23.6 million people, with no locally acquired cases of COVID-19 reported for 253 days between April and December 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Effective reproduction number of COVID-19 cases (the number of secondary cases generated by 1 primary case) and the probability of outbreak extinction (0 new cases within 20 generations). For model development and calibration, an estimation of the incubation period (interval from exposure to symptom onset), serial interval (time between symptom onset in an infector-infectee pair), and the statistical distribution of the number of any subsequent infections generated by 1 primary case was calculated. Results: This study analyzed data from 158 confirmed COVID-19 cases (median age, 45 years; interquartile range, 25-55 years; 84 men [53%]). An estimated 55% (95% credible interval [CrI], 41%-68%) of transmission events occurred during the presymptomatic stage. In our estimated analysis, case detection, contact tracing, and 14-day quarantine of close contacts (regardless of symptoms) was estimated to decrease the reproduction number from the counterfactual value of 2.50 to 1.53 (95% CrI, 1.50-1.57), which would not be sufficient for epidemic control, which requires a value of less than 1. In our estimated analysis, voluntary population-based interventions, if used alone, were estimated to have reduced the reproduction number to 1.30 (95% CrI, 1.03-1.58). Combined case-based and population-based interventions were estimated to reduce the reproduction number to below unity (0.85; 95% CrI, 0.78-0.89). Results were similar for additional analyses with influenza data and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: In this comparative effectiveness research study, the combination of case-based and population-based interventions (with wide adherence) may explain the success of COVID-19 control in Taiwan in 2020. Either category of interventions alone would have been insufficient, even in a country with an effective public health system and comprehensive contact tracing program.

These data support the concept that favipiravir could be paired with at least one more off-target antiviral agent (doxycycline, azithromycin, or ivermectin) followed by corticosteroids and antithrombotics to prevent COVID-19 hospitalization and death in those over age 50 and/or those with one or more comorbidities. Clinical trials and advanced practice should immediately pivot to combination/sequential drug therapy for ambulatory COVID-19 illness.","McCullough, Peter A",,,626

The advent of open-source DL libraries from major industrial entities, such as TensorFlow (Google), PyTorch (Facebook), and MXNet (Apache), further contributes to DL promises on the democratization of computational analytics. However, increased technical and specialized background is required to develop DL algorithms, and the variability of implementation details hinders their reproducibility. Towards lowering the barrier and making the mechanism of DL development, training, and inference more stable, reproducible, and scalable, without requiring an extensive technical background, this manuscript proposes the Generally Nuanced Deep Learning Framework (GaNDLF). With built-in support for $k$-fold cross-validation, data augmentation, multiple modalities and output classes, and multi-GPU training, as well as the ability to work with both radiographic and histologic imaging, GaNDLF aims to provide an end-to-end solution for all DL-related tasks, to tackle problems in medical imaging and provide a robust application framework for deployment in clinical workflows.","Pati, Sarthak; Thakur, Siddhesh P.; Bhalerao, Megh; Thermos, Spyridon; Baid, Ujjwal; Gotkowski, Karol; Gonzalez, Camila; Guley, Orhun; Hamamci, Ibrahim Ethem; Er, Sezgin; Grenko, Caleb; Edwards, Brandon; Sheller, Micah; Agraz, Jose; Baheti, Bhakti; Bashyam, Vishnu; Sharma, Parth; Haghighi, Babak; Gastounioti, Aimilia; Bergman, Mark; Mukhopadhyay, Anirban; Tsaftaris, Sotirios A.; Menze, Bjoern; Kontos, Despina; Davatzikos, Christos; Bakas, Spyridon",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01006v3.pdf,626
452302,Computational Errors and Incorrect Analysis in Study on Primary School Closures,2021,"Introduction: the threat of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to health systems and communities in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is enormous. Social approaches such as distancing measures are essential components of the public health response to respiratory-related infectious disease outbreaks. Due to socio-economic and broader peculiarities of SSA countries, social approaches that were effective elsewhere may have limited practicality in these contexts, and if practical; may yield different or even adverse results. We highlighted the effectiveness of these social approaches and their practicality in SSA. Methods: we conducted a comprehensive literature search through multiple databases, to identify articles relevant to social distancing. Findings were thematically summarized. Results: our review found emerging and varying empirical evidence on the effectiveness of social approaches in the control and mitigation of the COVID-19 pandemic; thus, limiting its applicability in SSA contexts. Nonetheless, our review demonstrates that the effectiveness and practicality of social approaches in SSA contexts will depend on available resources; timing, duration, and intensity of the intervention; and compliance. Weak political coordination, anti-science sentiments, distrust of political leaders and limited implementation of legal frameworks can also affect practicality. Conclusion: to overcome these challenges, tailoring and adaptation of these measures to different but unique contexts for maximum effectiveness, and investment in social insurance mechanisms, are vital.","Amaechi, Uchenna Anderson; Sodipo, Babasola Olufemi; Nnaji, Chukwudi Arnest; Owoyemi, Ayomide; Omitiran, Kasarachi; Okedo-Alex, Ijeoma Nkem; Eboreime, Ejemai; Ajumobi, Olufemi",Pan Afr Med J,,626
452303,Computational Errors and Incorrect Analysis in Study on Primary School Closures,2021,"Background: The difference in type of antibiotics and susceptibility of Bacteroides fragilis to antibiotics may influence warfarin anticoagulation. However, these influences have not been clarified in clinical settings. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate association the between the prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) and concomitant use of antibiotics in a real-world population of warfarin users. Methods: This was a single-center cohort study using data from health records and included patients who received ß-lactams (BLs)/fluoroquinolones (FQs) during ongoing warfarin treatment (2011-2015) at Hamamatsu University Hospital in Japan. Antibiotics were categorized into those to which B fragilis is susceptible (BLsus, FQsus) and those to which it is not (BLnon, FQnon) and into those given orally (BLpo, FQpo) or intravenously (BLiv, FQiv). Outcomes were excessive PT-INR and changes in PT-INR, defined as the ratio (INR ratio) and difference (&#916;INR) of maximum PT-INR and baseline PT-INR. Excessive PT-INR was graded as INR ratio of >1.5 or >2.5. Results: A total of 1185 warfarin users were included. The proportion of INR ratio >2.5 in FQiv was higher than in BLiv (95% CI: 1.59-46.5). The proportions with an INR ratio of >1.5 in BLsus and FQsus were higher than in BLnon (1.72-14.1) and FQnon (1.05-9.36), respectively. &#916;INR values in FQpo, FQiv, and FQsus were higher than those in BLpo, BLiv, and FQnon, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: Concomitant use of FQs, or of antibiotics to which B fragilis is susceptible is associated with higher risk of excessive anticoagulation. These findings would contribute to safe and proper antibiotic treatment in warfarin users.","Yagi, Tatsuya; Naito, Takafumi; Kato, Ayami; Hirao, Kensho; Kawakami, Junichi",Ann Pharmacother,,626

A study of integrated gross anatomy with embryology and its effect on learning and retention,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Social disruption associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatens to impede access to regular healthcare, including for people living with HIV (PLHIV), potentially resulting in antiretroviral therapy (ART) interruption (ATI). We aimed to explore the characteristics and factors associated with ATI during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: We conducted an online survey among PLHIV by convenience sampling through social media between 5 and 17 February 2020. Respondents were asked to report whether they were at risk of ATI (i.e. experienced ATI, risk of imminent ATI, threatened but resolved risk of ATI [obtaining ART prior to interruption]) or were not at risk of ATI associated with the COVID-19 outbreak. PLHIV were also asked to report perceived risk factors for ATI and sources of additional ART. The factors associated with the risk of ATI were assessed using logistic regression. We also evaluated the factors associated with experienced ATI. RESULTS: A total of 5084 PLHIV from 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities in mainland China completed the survey, with valid response rate of 99.4%. The median age was 31 years (IQR 27 to 37), 96.5% of participants were men, and 71.3% were men who had sex with men. Over one-third (35.1%, 1782/5084) reported any risk of ATI during the COVID-19 outbreak, including 2.7% (135/5084) who experienced ATI, 18.0% (917/5084) at risk of imminent ATI and 14.4% (730/5084) at threatened but resolved risk. PLHIV with ATI were more likely to have previous interruptions in ART (aOR 8.3, 95% CI 5.6 to 12.3), travelled away from where they typically receive HIV care (aOR 3.0, 95% CI 2.1 to 4.5), stayed in an area that implemented citywide lockdowns or travel restrictions to control COVID-19 (aOR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4 to 4.6), and be in permanent residence in a rural area (aOR 3.7, 95% CI 2.3 to 5.8). CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of PLHIV in China are at risk of ATI during the COVID-19 outbreak and some have already experienced ATI. Correlates of ATI and self-reported barriers to ART suggest that social disruptions from COVID-19 have contributed to ATI. Our findings demonstrate an urgent need for policies and interventions to maintain access to HIV care during public health emergencies.","Sun, Yinghui; Li, Hui; Luo, Ganfeng; Meng, Xiaojun; Guo, Wei; Fitzpatrick, Thomas; Ao, Yunlong; Feng, Anping; Liang, Bowen; Zhan, Yuewei; Sande, Amakobe; Xie, Feng; Wang, Ying; Qian, Han-Zhu; Cai, Yong; Zou, Huachun",J Int AIDS Soc,,626

This study aims to assess how oncological disease impacts on the clinical course of COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1st March to 30th April 2020, 96 COVID-19 patients were classified according to clinical outcome as severe (n=67) and moderate (n=29). Demographic data, medical history, admission lymphocytes, procalcitonin (PCT), c-reactive-protein (CRP), D-dimer, and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) were collected. RESULTS: A statistically significant association was found between hypertension (p=0.007) and three or more comorbidities with severe outcomes (p=0.034). No statistical differences were found between the severe and moderate groups with regards to the rate of patients with past oncological history. However, no patient allocated in the moderate group had received oncological treatment within 12 months. Higher values of CRP, IL-6, D-Dimer and lower values of lymphocytes were reported in the severe group (p=0.0007, p=0.00386, p=0.041, and p=0.007, respectively). Using binary logistic regression, higher values of CRP (OR=8.861; p=0.012) and PCT were associated with a higher risk of severe outcome (OR=21.075; p=0.008). Within the oncological population, D-Dimer and IL-6 did not confirm their prognostic significance as in the general population (p>0.05).

Furthermore, we analyze the stability of the model in the context of Ulam-Hyers and generalized Ulam-Hyers stability criteria. The concept of next-generation matrices was used to compute the basic reproduction number R0, a number that determines the spread or otherwise of the disease into the general population. We also investigated the local asymptotic stability for the derived disease-free equilibrium point. Numerical simulation of the constructed epidemic model was carried out using the fractional Adam-Bashforth-Moulton method to validate the obtained theoretical results.","Akindeinde, S.

School-based alcohol and tobacco use prevention programmes that have demonstrated efficacy are most often based on psychosocial skill development, individuals' experiential learning strategies, and community resources. Furthermore, early and prolonged interventions have been recommended. Primavera is a pluri-annual, generic, multimodal, experiential-oriented prevention program. It runs over a three-year period from the last year of primary school to the second year of secondary school. This randomized controlled cluster study aimed at assessing the effects of the Primavera programme compared to a control prevention intervention among schoolchildren from 10 to 12 years in eight secondary schools in a particular French geographical area. The primary outcomes were lifetime tobacco use and past-month alcohol use. Data were collected at baseline and over three follow-up time points. In all, 287 and 266 questionnaires, respectively, were collected at baseline from the Primavera group and from the control group. Attrition was 45% and 41%, respectively. The SARS-COV2 pandemic crisis made it impossible for questionnaires to be collected during the final year. After adjustment, children from the Primavera group were less likely to report current alcohol use at the end of the first year (odds ratio = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.18-0.78) and past-month alcohol use at the end of the second year (odds ratio = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.01-0.66) compared to those from the control group. The results for psychosocial skills and alcohol and tobacco use denormalization were contrasted. Primavera is shown to be effective in reducing alcohol use among schoolchildren.","Diaz Gomez, C.; Morel, A.; Sedano, I.; Aubin, H.

479807,Errors in Tables 1 and 2,2021,"BACKGROUND: The Hadassah Medical Organization operates two hospitals in Jerusalem. During the COVID-19 pandemic it made an administrative decision to operate one hospital as a COVID-19 treatment hospital (CTH) and to have the second function as a non-COVID-19 treating hospital (NCTH) offering general medical services. The purpose of this study was to assess how this decision affected hospital worker anxiety. METHODS: From April 27 to May 1, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, while the country was under lock-down, an electronic questionnaire survey was carried out among hospital workers of the CTH and NCTH. The questionnaire includes personal demographics and attitudes about COVID-19 and assesses present anxiety state using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI-S) validated questionnaire. A STAI-S score of &#8805;45 was considered to represent clinical anxiety. RESULTS: Completed questionnaires were received from 1570 hospital employees (24%). 33.5% of responders had STAI-S scores &#8805;45. Multivariable regression analysis showed that being a resident doctor (odds ration [OR] 2.13; 95% CL, 1.41-3.23; P = 0.0003), age &#8804; 50 (OR, 2.08; 95% Cl, 1.62-2.67; P < .0001), being a nurse (OR, 1.29; 95% CL, 1.01-1.64; P = 0.039), female gender (OR, 1.63; 95% CL, 1.25-2.13; P = 0.0003) and having risk factors for COVID-19 (OR, 1.51; 95% CL, 1.19-1.91; P = 0.0007), but not hospital workplace (p = 0.08), were associated with the presence of clinical anxiety. 69% of the responders had been tested for COVID-19, but only nine were positive. CTH workers estimated that the likelihood of their already being infected with COVID-19 to be 21.5 ± 24.7% as compared to the 15.3 ± 19.5% estimate of NCTH workers (p = 0.0001). 50% (545/1099) of the CTH workers and 51% (168/330) of the NCTH workers responded that the most important cause of their stress was a fear of infecting their families (p = 0.7). CONCLUSIONS: By multivariable analysis the creation of a NCTH during the COVID-19 pandemic was not found to be associated with a decrease in the number of hospital workers with clinical anxiety.

485236,Error in Figure,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is a type of beta-CoV that develops acute pneumonia, which is an inflammatory condition. A cytokine storm has been recognized as one of the leading causes of death in patients with COVID-19. ALI and ARDS along with multiple organ failure have also been presented as the consequences of acute inflammation and cytokine storm. It has been previously confirmed that SARS-CoV, as another member of the beta-CoV family, activates NLRP3 inflammasome and consequently develops acute inflammation in a variety of ways through having complex interactions with the host immune system using structural and nonstructural proteins. Numerous studies conducted on Tranilast have further demonstrated that the given drug can act as an effective anti-chemotactic factor on controlling inflammation, and thus, it can possibly help the improvement of the acute form of COVID-19 by inhibiting some key inflammation-associated transcription factors such as NF-&#954;B and impeding NLRP3 inflammasome. Several studies have comparably revealed the direct effect of this drug on the prevention of inappropriate tissue's remodeling; inhibition of neutrophils, IL-5, and eosinophils; repression of inflammatory cell infiltration into inflammation site; restriction of factors involved in acute airway inflammation like IL-33; and suppression of cytokine IL-13, which increase mucosal secretions.

This study uses the secondary data of COVID-19 daily cases from the webpage of Ministry of Health (MOH), Singapore. Spearman and Kendall rank correlation tests were used to investigate the correlation between COVID-19 and meteorological parameters. Temperature, dew point, relative humidity, absolute humidity, and water vapor showed positive significant correlation with COVID-19 pandemic. These results will help the epidemiologists to understand the behavior of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus against meteorological variables. This study finding would be also a useful supplement to help the local healthcare policymakers, Center for Disease Control (CDC), and the World Health Organization (WHO) in the process of strategy making to combat COVID-19 in Singapore.","Pani, Shantanu Kumar; Lin, Neng-Huei; RavindraBabu, Saginela",Sci Total Environ,,626

590952,Factors Associated With Access to and Timing of Coronavirus Testing Among US Adults After Onset of Febrile Illness,2021-05-03,"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic provoked a change to normal surgical practice in the United Kingdom and led to an increase in acute appendicitis (AA) patients being treated conservatively with antibiotics. We aim to analyse the management of patients presenting with AA to our institution during the first wave of the pandemic, comparing surgically and conservatively managed patients. Method All patients presenting to our centre with AA between March and July 2020 were included. Six-month follow-up data were collected retrospectively using electronic records. Patients were categorised into surgically and conservatively managed groups. The primary outcome was the complication rate (post-operative complications vs failure of antibiotic treatment) and the secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay and Alvarado score. Results Fifty-seven patients (n=57) were admitted with AA, 45.6% (n=26) managed conservatively compared to 54.4% (n=31) treated surgically. Higher complication rates were observed amongst the conservatively managed group, although not found to be statistically significant (16% vs 35%; p=0.131). There was no significant difference in length of hospital stay observed between the two groups (surgical: median, 2; interquartile range, 2-3 vs conservative: median, 3; interquartile range, 2-4). White cell count (WCC) and Alvarado score were higher on admission in the surgical group with statistical significance (p=0.012 and p=0.028, respectively). Conclusions COVID-19 has led to a significant cohort of conservatively managed AA patients in the United Kingdom. We propose a stratification pathway based on clinical severity, Alvarado score and imaging to facilitate safe selection for conservative management of AA, in order to reduce failure of treatment rates in this patient group. Further UK-based studies will add to the evidence-based surrounding safe management of AA with conservative treatment.","Lotfallah, Andrew; Aamery, Amaar; Moussa, George; Manu, Mangta",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33927917/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.14095,626
602638,Testing Olfactory and Gustatory Dysfunctions among Quarantine COVID-19 Suspects,2020-10-14,"ABSTRACT: Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a member of genus gamma-coronavirus in the family Coronaviridae, causing serious economic losses to the poultry industry. Reverse genetics is a common technique to study the biological characteristics of viruses. So far, there is no BAC reverse genetic system available for rescue of IBV infectious clone. In the present study, a new strategy for the construction of IBV infectious cDNA clone was established. The full-length genomic cDNA of IBV vaccine strain H120 was constructed in pBAC vector from four IBV fragment subcloning vectors by homologous recombination, which contained the CMV promoter at the 5′ end and the hepatitis D virus ribozyme (HDVR) sequence and bovine growth hormone polyadenylation (BGH) sequence after the polyA tail at the 3′ end of the full-length cDNA. Subsequently, using the same technique, another plasmid pBAC-H120/SCS1 was also constructed, in which S1 gene from IBV H120 strain was replaced with that of a virulent SC021202 strain. Recombinant virus rH120 and rH120/SCS1 were rescued by transfecting the plasmids into BHK cells and passaged in embryonated chicken eggs. Finally, the pathogenicity of both the recombinant virus strains rH120 and rH120/SCS1 was evaluated in SPF chickens. The results showed that the chimeric rH120/SCS1 strain was not pathogenic compared with the wild-type IBV SC021202 strain and the chickens inoculated with rH120/SCS1 could resist challenge infection by IBV SC021202. Taken together, our results indicate that BAC reverse genetic system could be used to rescue IBV in vitro and IBV S1 protein alone might not be the key factor for IBV pathogenicity. KEY POINTS: • BAC vector was used to construct IBV full-length cDNA by homologous recombination. • Based on four subcloning vectors, a recombinant chimeric IBV H120/SCS1 was constructed and rescued. • Pathogenicity of H120/SCS1 was similar to that of H120, but different to that of SC021202.","Lv, Chenfei; Shi, Tingting; Zhu, Pengpeng; Peng, Xing; Cao, Shangshang; Yan, Yan; Ojha, Nishant Kumar; Liao, Min; Zhou, Jiyong",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32813067/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-020-10834-2,626
608439,Ephemeral history of the three-bladed tracheostomy dilator.,2021-07-05,"BACKGROUND: Highly pathogenic influenza viruses cause high levels of morbidity, including excessive infiltration of leukocytes into the lungs, high viral loads and a cytokine storm. However, the details of how these pathological features unfold in severe influenza infections remain unclear. Accumulation of Gr1 + CD11b + myeloid cells has been observed in highly pathogenic influenza infections but it is not clear how and why they accumulate in the severely inflamed lung. In this study, we selected this cell population as a target to investigate the extreme inflammatory response during severe influenza infection. RESULTS: We established H1N1 IAV-infected mouse models using three viruses of varying pathogenicity and noted the accumulation of a defined Gr1 + CD11b + myeloid population correlating with the pathogenicity. Herein, we reported that CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes are the major cell compartments in this population. Of note, impaired clearance of the high pathogenicity virus prolonged IFN expression, leading to CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes amplifying their own recruitment via an interferon-α/β receptor 1 (IFNAR1)-triggered chemokine loop. Blockage of IFNAR1-triggered signaling or inhibition of viral replication by Oseltamivir significantly suppresses the expression of CCR2 ligands and reduced the influx of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes. Furthermore, trafficking of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes from the bone marrow to the lung was evidenced by a CCR2-dependent chemotaxis. Importantly, leukocyte infiltration, cytokine storm and expression of iNOS were significantly reduced in CCR2−/− mice lacking infiltrating CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes, enhancing the survival of the infected mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that uncontrolled viral replication leads to excessive production of inflammatory innate immune responses by accumulating CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes, which contribute to the fatal outcomes of high pathogenicity virus infections.","Lin, Sue-Jane; Lo, Ming; Kuo, Rei-Lin; Shih, Shin-Ru; Ojcius, David M; Lu, Jean; Lee, Chien-Kuo; Chen, Hui-Chen; Lin, Meei Yun; Leu, Chuen-Miin; Lin, Chia-Ni; Tsai, Ching-Hwa",J Biomed Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25407417/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12929-014-0099-6,626
609006,Errors in Tables 1 and 2,2021-05-17,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a global pandemic, resulting in a disease termed COVID-19, which commonly presents in adults as a typical infection of the upper respiratory tract. Although the disease is often acute, one in ten patients can continue to be affected for weeks or months, resulting in a state called long COVID. Existing evidence suggests there are no patient-centred instruments for capturing the impact of long COVID on the quality of life of people affected. METHODS: The Jandhyala Method was used to identify indicators of long COVID quality of life. The resulting post-acute (long) COVID-19 Quality of Life (PAC-19QoL) instrument was validated with a control group of unaffected participants and finally implemented in the dedicated patient registry, PAC-19QoLReg. PARTICIPANTS: 15 participants suffering from long COVID, who have been positively diagnosed with COVID-19, either via diagnostic or antibody tests and a validation control group of 16 healthy participants who have not suffered from COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Indicators submitted by participants with long COVID that address the specific impact of the illness on their quality of life. RESULTS: Forty-four Quality of Life Indicators (QoLI) across four domains, namely, psychological, physical, social, and work, were agreed by the participants with long COVID to be relevant for the assessment of their quality of life (CI > 0.5). The validation stage identified 35/44 QoLIs that differentiated between the two groups, with a statistically significant difference between the mean QoLI Likert Scores (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The PAC-19QoL instrument and PAC-19QoLReg prospective observational cohort clinical study will enable an understanding of disease progression, on and off treatment, on the quality of life of patients with long COVID beyond simple symptomatology.

609742,New Onset Vertigo After COVID-19 Infection. A Case Report,2021-07-04,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) membrane protein is an abundant virion protein, and its interaction with the nucleocapsid protein is crucial for viral assembly and morphogenesis. Although the interacting region in the nucleocapsid protein was mapped to residues 168–208, the interacting region in the membrane protein and the interaction nature are still unclear. In this work, by using yeast two-hybrid and surface plasmon resonance techniques, the residues 197–221 of the membrane protein and the residues 351–422 of the nucleocapsid protein were determined to be involved in their interaction. Sequence analysis revealed that these two fragments are highly charged at neutral pH, suggesting that their interaction may be of ionic nature. Kinetic assays indicated that the endodomain (aa102–221) of the membrane protein interacts with the nucleocapsid protein with high affinity (K(D) = 0.55 ± 0.04 μM), however, this interaction could be weakened greatly by acidification, higher salt concentration (400 mM NaCl) and divalent cation (50 mM Ca(2+)), which suggests that electrostatic attraction might play an important role in this interaction. In addition, it is noted that two highly conserved amino acids (L218 and L219) in the membrane protein are not involved in this interaction. Here, we show that electrostatic interactions between the carboxyl termini of SARS-CoV membrane protein and nucleocapsid protein largely mediate the interaction of these two proteins. These results might facilitate therapeutic strategies aiming at the disruption of the association between SARS-CoV membrane and nucleocapsid proteins.","Luo, Haibin; Wu, Dalei; Shen, Can; Chen, Kaixian; Shen, Xu; Jiang, Hualiang",Int J Biochem Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16343974/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1357272505003754; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357272505003754,626
617185,Estimation and Comparison of Current and Future Racial/Ethnic Representation in the US Health Care Workforce,2021-03-31,"BACKGROUND: South Africa implemented rapid and strict physical distancing regulations to minimize SARS-CoV-2 epidemic spread. Evidence on the impact of such measures on interpersonal contact in rural and lower-income settings is limited. METHODS: We compared population-representative social contact surveys conducted in the same rural KwaZulu-Natal location once in 2019 and twice in mid-2020. Respondents reported characteristics of physical and conversational (‘close interaction’) contacts over 24 hours. We built age-mixing matrices and estimated the proportional change in the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number (R(0)). Respondents also reported counts of others present at locations visited and transport used, from which we evaluated change in potential exposure to airborne infection due to shared indoor space (‘shared air’). RESULTS: Respondents in March–December 2019 (n = 1704) reported a mean of 7.4 close interaction contacts and 196 shared air person-hours beyond their homes. Respondents in June-July 2020 (n = 216), as the epidemic peaked locally, reported 4.1 close interaction contacts and 21 shared air person-hours outside their home, with significant declines in others’ homes and public spaces. Adults aged over 50 had fewer close contacts with others over 50, but little change in contact with 15–29 year olds, reflecting ongoing contact within multigenerational households. We estimate potential R(0) fell by 42% (95% plausible range 14–59%) between 2019 and June-July 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Extra-household social contact fell substantially following imposition of Covid-19 distancing regulations in rural South Africa. Ongoing contact within intergenerational households highlighted a potential limitation of social distancing measures in protecting older adults.

A Prospective Study,2021-01-29,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the care of people with sleep disorders, to explore relationships between OSA and COVID-19, and to describe current knowledge of the effect of the pandemic on sleep globally. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 has led to significant changes in the practice of sleep medicine, including the care of patients with OSA. An OSA diagnosis may portend a worse prognosis with COVID-19, whilst prior COVID-19 may have an impact on sleep breathing. SUMMARY: The pandemic has caused marked difficulties with access to diagnostic sleep studies and reduced capacity for CPAP initiation. Conversely, adherence to CPAP therapy may have improved, and use of remote consultations and telemonitoring has increased. An OSA diagnosis may be associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19, although any apparent relationship may be attributable to confounding factors, such as obesity and metabolic disease. Small studies have reported some increase in CPAP requirements in OSA patients following COVID-19 infection. More generally, the pandemic has been associated with a deterioration in subjective sleep quality across the population; much of this appears because of increased anxiety and stress. Finally, studies assessing putative links between COVID-19 and REM sleep issues are ongoing.","Gill, Cara M; Piggott, Laura M; Kent, Brian D",Curr Opin Pulm Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34431790/; https://doi.org/10.1097/mcp.0000000000000822,626

We aimed to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and biological effect of administering high‐dose intravenous zinc (HDIVZn) to patients with COVID‐19. We performed a Phase IIa double‐blind, randomized controlled trial to compare HDIVZn to placebo in hospitalized patients with COVID‐19. We administered trial treatment per day for a maximum of 7 days until either death or hospital discharge. We measured zinc concentration at baseline and during treatment and observed patients for any significant side effects. For eligible patients, we randomized and administered treatment to 33 adult participants to either HDIVZn (n = 15) or placebo (n = 18). We observed no serious adverse events throughout the study for a total of 94 HDIVZn administrations. However, three participants in the HDIVZn group reported infusion site irritation. Mean serum zinc on Day 1 in the placebo, and the HDIVZn group was 6.9 ± 1.1 and 7.7 ± 1.6 µmol/l, respectively, consistent with zinc deficiency. HDIVZn, but not placebo, increased serum zinc levels above the deficiency cutoff of 10.7 µmol/l (p < .001) on Day 6. Our study did not reach its target enrollment because stringent public health measures markedly reduced patient hospitalizations. Hospitalized COVID‐19 patients demonstrated zinc deficiency. This can be corrected with HDIVZn. Such treatment appears safe, feasible, and only associated with minimal peripheral infusion site irritation. This pilot study justifies further investigation of this treatment in COVID‐19 patients.","Patel, Oneel; Chinni, Vidyasagar; El‐Khoury, John; Perera, Marlon; Neto, Ary S.; McDonald, Christine; See, Emily; Jones, Daryl; Bolton, Damien; Bellomo, Rinaldo; Trubiano, Jason; Ischia, Joseph",J Med Virol,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26895; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33629384/,626
637232,Olfactory and Gustatory Dysfunction as an Early Identifier of COVID-19 in Adults and Children: An International Multicenter Study,2020-06-16,"BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections are well known factors underlying acute exacerbations in bronchiectasis. However, viral infections may also contribute to acute exacerbations. We aimed to assess the rate of viral detection in acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis, and the associated clinical factors. METHODS: Diagnostic tests for viral and bacterial etiologies were performed in 792 patients with bronchiectasis who visited the emergency room or the respiratory care inpatient unit in a tertiary referral center in South Korea. All patients were diagnosed with bronchiectasis by chest computerized tomography and were prescribed antibiotics for a minimum of 3 days. RESULTS: Viral pathogens were detected in 202 of the 792 enrolled patients (25.5%). The most common viral pathogen isolated was influenza A virus (24.8%), followed by rhinovirus (22.4%), influenza B virus (9.8%), respiratory syncytial virus B (8.9%), and human metapneumovirus (6.1%). In 145 patients, a viral, but not bacterial, pathogen was detected, whereas no pathogens were found in 443 patients with exacerbations. Multivariable analysis revealed that female sex and chronic heart disease as a comorbidity were positively associated with viral detection in acute exacerbations of patients with bronchiectasis, whereas the presence of radiographic infiltration was negatively associated. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses were identified in approximately 25% of the acute exacerbations observed among patients with bronchiectasis. Of the viruses detected, influenza viruses and rhinovirus made up over 50%. More attention to viruses as possible causative pathogens for acute deteriorating symptoms in patients with bronchiectasis is warranted.","Park, Yea Eun; Sung, Heungsup; Oh, Yeon-Mok",J Korean Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2021.36.e217; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34463061/,626
639109,Our Experience of Tracheostomy in COVID-19 Patients,2020-08-10,"While the nasopharynx in the upper respiratory airway is the dominant initial infection site for SARS-CoV-2, the physiologic mechanism that launches the infection in the lower airway is still not well-understood. Based on the rapidity with which SARS-CoV-2 infection progresses to the lungs, it has been conjectured that the nasopharynx acts as the seeding zone for subsequent contamination of the lower airway via aspiration of virus-laden boluses of nasopharyngeal fluids. In this study, we examine the plausibility of this proposed mechanism. To this end, we have developed computational fluid mechanics models of the inhalation process in two medical imaging based airway reconstructions and have quantified the nasopharyngeal liquid volume ingested into the lower airspace during each aspiration. The numerical predictions are validated by comparing the number of projected aspirations (approximately 2 - 4) during an eight-hour sleep cycle with prior observational findings of 3 aspirations in human subjects. Extending the numerical trends on aspiration volume to earlier records on aspiration frequency for the entire day indicates a total aspirated nasopharyngeal liquid volume of 0.3 - 0.76 ml per day. We then used sputum assessment data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients to estimate the number of virions that are transmitted daily to the lungs via nasopharyngeal liquid boluses. For mean sputum viral load, our modeling projects that the number of virions penetrating to the lower airway per day will range over 2.1(10^6) - 5.3(10^6); for peak viral load, the corresponding number of penetrating virions hovers between 7.1(10^8) - 17.9(10^8). These findings fill in a key piece of the mechanistic puzzle of the progression from SARS-CoV-2 infection of the nasopharynx to the development of COVID-19 disease within a patient, and point to dysphagia as a potential underlying risk factor for COVID-19. The findings also have significant practical implications in the design of COVID-19 prophylactics and therapeutics that aim to constrain the pathogenic progress of the disease within the limits of the upper airway.","Basu, S.; Chakravarty, A.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.19.20248544; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248544v1?rss=1,626

643592,Error in the Affiliations,2020-09-16,"The emergence of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (hCoVs) in the last two decades has illuminated their potential to cause high morbidity and mortality in human populations and disrupt global economies. Global pandemic concerns stem from their high mortality rates, capacity for human-to-human spread by respiratory transmission, and complete lack of approved therapeutic countermeasures. Limiting disease may require the development of virus-directed and host-directed therapeutic strategies due to the acute etiology of hCoV infections. Therefore, understanding how hCoV–host interactions cause pathogenic outcomes relies upon mammalian models that closely recapitulate the pathogenesis of hCoVs in humans. Pragmatism has largely been the driving force underpinning mice as highly effective mammalian models for elucidating hCoV–host interactions that govern pathogenesis. Notably, tractable mouse genetics combined with hCoV reverse genetic systems has afforded the concomitant manipulation of virus and host genetics to evaluate virus–host interaction networks in disease. In addition to assessing etiologies of known hCoVs, mouse models have clinically predictive value as tools to appraise potential disease phenotypes associated with pre-emergent CoVs. Knowledge of CoV pathogenic potential before it crosses the species barrier into the human population provides a highly desirable preclinical platform for addressing global pathogen preparedness, an overarching directive of the World Health Organization. Although we recognize that results obtained in robust mouse models require evaluation in non-human primates, we focus this review on the current state of hCoV mouse models, their use as tractable complex genetic organisms for untangling complex hCoV–host interactions, and as pathogenesis models for preclinical evaluation of novel therapeutic interventions.","Cockrell, Adam S.; Leist, Sarah R.; Douglas, Madeline G.; Baric, Ralph S.",Mamm Genome,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00335-018-9760-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30043100/,626

649192,Impact of the Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic on Head and Neck Cancer Care,2021-03-30,"La pandémie à coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) a contraint les pouvoirs publics français à instaurer un confinement à domicile de la population, avec un impact potentiel sur l’équilibre glycémique des patients diabétiques. Dans ce contexte, la télémédecine semble être un outil pertinent pour assurer le suivi de ces patients. Nous avons réalisé une étude prospective observationnelle, aux Hôpitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, ainsi que dans un cabinet libéral de la ville, afin d’évaluer l’équilibre glycémique à 3 mois de 491 patients diabétiques, suivis par téléconsultation (n = 338) ou dont la consultation en présentiel a été reportée à 6 mois (n = 153). Des questionnaires de satisfaction patients et médecins ont été recueillis pour apprécier l’impact des actions de télémédecine. À 3 mois, une réduction moyenne non significative de -0,33 % du taux d’hémoglobine glyquée (HbA1c) était observée dans le groupe suivi par téléconsultation (n = 175) contre -0,13 % dans le groupe sans téléconsultation (n = 92). Dans le groupe téléconsultation, l’HbA1c diminuait de 7,65 ± 1,19 % à 7,18 ± 0,9 % pour les patients suivis à l’hôpital (n = 97), et de 7,28 ± 0,80 % à 7,11 ± 0,79 % pour les patients suivis en ville (n = 78). Quatre-vingt-douze pourcents des patients se sont déclarés satisfaits de leur téléconsultation, positionnant la téléconsultation comme une alternative à une consultation en présentiel et la recommanderaient à un autre patient diabétique. Alors que sept diabétologues sur huit n’avaient jamais effectué de téléconsultation, tous souhaitent continuer cette modalité de suivi après la crise sanitaire. Au regard des données manquantes - en lien avec les difficultés de recueil pendant la pandémie - la tendance à l’amélioration de l’équilibre glycémique observée dans le groupe téléconsultation doit être confirmée par une évaluation à 6 mois de l’équilibre glycémique des patients. The COVID-19 pandemic has compelled the French government to impose confinement measures to stem the spread of the coronavirus. These measures may have had a potential impact on the glycemic control of diabetic patients. Within this context, telemedicine appears to be a viable option for follow-up appointments of diabetic patients. To assess this theory, we simultaneously led a prospective observational study during the novel coronavirus pandemic at Strasbourg’s teaching hospital and at a private medical office to evaluate glycemic control in 491 diabetic patients either attending a telehealth appointment (n=338) or whom in-person consultation had been postponed by 6 months (n=153). Surveys were collected to assess both the patients’ and the physicians’ satisfaction. A decrease in average glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was observed among patients from the telehealth appointment group: ΔHbA1c = -0.33% (n=175) as well as the other group: ΔHbA1c = -0.13% (n=92) 3 months after the beginning of the study. Patients belonging to the telehealth appointment group at Strasbourg’s teaching hospital (n=97) experienced a decrease in their HbA1c average from 7.65 ± 1.19% to 7.18 ± 0.9%, while patients from the same group attending a private medical office (n=78) also experienced a decrease from 7.28 ± 0.80% to 7.11 ± 0.79%. Ninety-two percent of patients were satisfied with the telehealth appointment, think it could be a virtual alternative to in-person consultation and would recommend it to other diabetic patients. Even though seven out of eight diabetologists had never offered telehealth appointments to their patients prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, all of them hope to provide such services to their patients once the health crisis is over.

In this study, we investigated the suitability of Advax™, a stable particulate polymorph of inulin, also referred to as delta inulin, as a mucosal adjuvant for whole inactivated influenza vaccine (WIV) administered either as a liquid or dry powder formulation. Spray freeze-drying produced Advax-adjuvanted WIV powder particles in a size range (1–5 μm) suitable for inhalation. The physical and biological characteristics of both WIV and Advax remained unaltered both by admixing WIV with Advax and by spray freeze drying. Upon intranasal or pulmonary immunization, both liquid and dry powder formulations containing Advax induced significantly higher systemic, mucosal and cellular immune responses than non-adjuvanted WIV formulations. Furthermore, pulmonary immunization with Advax-adjuvanted WIV led to robust memory B cell responses along with an increase of lung localization factors i.e. CXCR3, CD69, and CD103. A less pronounced but still positive effect of Advax was seen on memory T cell responses. In contrast to animals immunized with WIV alone, all animals pulmonary immunized with a single dose of Advax-adjuvanted WIV were fully protected with no visible clinical symptoms against a lethal dose of influenza virus. These data confirm that Advax is a potent mucosal adjuvant that boosts vaccine-induced humoral and cellular immune responses both in the lung and systemically with major positive effects on B-cell memory and complete protection against live virus. Hence, respiratory tract immunization, particularly via the lungs, with Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulation as a liquid or dry powder is a promising alternative to parenteral influenza vaccination.","Tomar, Jasmine; Patil, Harshad P.; Bracho, Gustavo; Tonnis, Wouter F.; Frijlink, Henderik W.; Petrovsky, Nikolai; Vanbever, Rita; Huckriede, Anke; Hinrichs, Wouter L.J.",J Control Release,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30218687/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016836591830525X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.09.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016836591830525X,626
656553,Post Viral Olfactory Dysfunction After SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Anticipated Post-pandemic Clinical Challenge,2021-07-07,"Histophilus somni (formerly Haemophilus somnus) is a Gram-negative pleomorphic coccobacillus that causes respiratory, reproductive, cardiac and neuronal diseases in cattle. H. somni is a member of the bovine respiratory disease complex that causes severe bronchopneumonia in cattle. Previously, it has been reported that bovine neutrophils and macrophages have limited ability to phagocytose and kill H. somni. Recently, it was discovered that bovine neutrophils and macrophages produce extracellular traps in response to Mannheimia haemolytica, another member of the bovine respiratory disease complex. In this study, we demonstrate that H. somni also causes extracellular trap production by bovine neutrophils in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which did not coincide with the release of lactate dehydrogenase, a marker for necrosis. Neutrophil extracellular traps were produced in response to outer membrane vesicles, but not lipooligosacchride alone. Using scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy, we observed H. somni cells trapped within a web-like structure. Further analyses demonstrated that bovine neutrophils trapped and killed H. somni in a DNA-dependent manner. Treatment of DNA extracellular traps with DNase I freed H. somni cells and diminished bacterial death. Treatment of bovine monocyte-derived macrophages with H. somni cells also caused macrophage extracellular trap formation. These findings suggest that extracellular traps may play a role in the host response to H. somni infection in cattle.","Hellenbrand, Katrina M.; Forsythe, Katelyn M.; Rivera-Rivas, Jose J.; Czuprynski, Charles J.; Aulik, Nicole A.",Microb Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2012.09.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23022668/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0882401012001672; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401012001672,626
660319,A Systematic Review on Tracheostomy in COVID-19 Patients: Current Guidelines and Safety Measures,2020-09-28,"The purpose of this subacute 22-day study was to evaluate methods for canine circulating immunoglobulins (IgM, IgG, and IgE) and select B- and T-lymphocyte populations (CD4-helpers, CD8-suppressors, pan-T and pan-B) for immunotoxicity testing using an organ system (concordance) approach. The challenge substance for immunoglobulin testing was repeated immunization with six-way distemper vaccination (DHLAPP), while the challenge substance for leukocyte subpopulations was treatment with cyclophosphamide. Immunoglobulin measurements were made by capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and leukocyte immunophenotyping by fluorescein isothiocyanate/phycoerythrin conjugation (flow cytometry). A battery of parameters that would be used in a typical regulatory study were taken to aid interpretation of the data generated by these methods. Body weights, food consumption, clinical observations, complete clinical chemistry and urinalysis measurements were taken. Gross pathology and micropathology of sternal bone marrow, spleen, mesenteric and retropharyngeal lymph nodes, thymus, liver and kidney were completed. The ELISA method demonstrated acceptable intra-assay reproducibility for IgM, IgG and IgE, with values in good agreement as reported for radial immunodiffusion. The immunologic challenge demonstrated a biological trend of an increase in IgM that preceded an increase in IgG with no discernible trend in IgE response, and no abnormalities in lymphocyte subpopulations. Principle flow cytometry findings related to cyclophosphamide were that the relative percent of B cells decreased dramatically and progressively after compound administration; being statistically decreased in males on day 22 compared with day −5. The relative percent CD4 and CD8 contribution increased, but the CD4/CD8 ratio remained relatively unchanged as total white blood cells decreased progressively. The increase in relative percent CD4 (males only) was statistically significant according to a two-sample t-test on days 17, 20 and 22 when compared with the pre-treatment day −5. There was a relative percent increase in CD5-panT, but absolute numbers were dramatically decreased. We conclude that an organ system approach to assessment of the immune system which incorporates humoral antibody, enumeration of lymphocyte populations and pathologic evaluation of the lymphoreticular organs assists in the interpretation of an adverse toxicological response. The ELISA method for measurement of Igs detected the expected levels of IgG, IgM and IgE due to repeated vaccinations and to cyclophosphamide treatment. The flow cytometry method was acceptable for measuring select canine lymphocyte populations and detecting the expected decrease in B cells due to cyclophosphamide treatment. Both methods may be added to a testing battery for assessing immunotoxicity in canine regulatory studies.","Jones, R.D; Offutt, D.M; Longmoor, B.A",Toxicol Lett,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378427400001739; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10817629/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378427400001739,626

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a large group of children between 1 and 10 years old in Lombardy, Italy (n = 3392). Their parents filled in a survey answering single or multiple-choice questions about their offspring’s behavior changes (including sleep, dietary habits, emotional disturbances), relationship with siblings, parents and peers, the use of digital technologies, and distance learning experience during the lockdown. RESULTS: Parents reported lifestyles and emotional alterations during the lockdown. The modifications of family relationships, parents’ remote working, and screen time were associated with sleep, emotional and behavioral modifications. Distance learning was overall considered adequate. CONCLUSIONS: This study reported the most updated data on the effects of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on children between 1 and 10 years of age in a large sample of Italian schoolchildren. The results of this study point out that pediatricians and authorities should support relationships within families during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Aim of the study is to highlight the vulnerability of the aged amidst the current COVID-19 pandemic, and in the light of the recent international evidence, suggests what government could do to mitigate their vulnerability. METHODS: Data from the recently released (November 2019) 75th Round National Sample Survey (NSS), which was conducted from July 2017 to June 2018, across 8077 rural villages and 6181 urban wards was used for this study. Data collected from 555,115 individuals (rural: 325,232; urban: 229,232) included 42,762 elderly individuals (60 years or above). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used for the calculation. RESULTS: Of the total sample of elderly individuals, 27.7% reported suffering from an ailment in the last 15 days, whereas 8.5% had been hospitalized during the last 365 days. Among the elderly, hospitalization rate was higher in the urban areas (OR: 1.23), general social category (OR: 1.18), richest economic quintile (OR: 1.69), and among those living alone (OR: 2.40). Also, among the elderly, 64% of those in the scheduled tribe (social group) and 51% in the poorest economic quintile utilized public facilities for hospitalization. Cardiovascular ailments were the major cause for hospitalization (18.1%) and outpatient visit (32%) among the elderly. Ailments related to diabetes and hypertension constituted 55% of outpatient visit for the elderly. Only 18.9% of the elderly had health insurance though chances of facing catastrophic health expenditures were high among the elderly. 6.6% of elderly female and 1.6% male live alone, and 27.5% of age 80 years and above are immobile. 50% of male and 90% of female are financially dependent on others and more so in poorer economic quintiles. CONCLUSIONS: The vulnerability of India’s elderly increases across economic levels, and other dimensions such as the place of residence, gender, social group (caste), marital status, living arrangements, surviving children, and economic dependence. The current COVID-19 pandemic poses a greater risk of social isolation among the elderly, which may cause detrimental health impact.

669179,Chicago's Stay-at-Home Mandate-The Need to Improve on Domestic Violence Prevention and Response,2021,"Pancreatic cancer, at unresectable advanced stages, presents poor prognoses, which could be prevented by early pancreatic cancer diagnosis methods. Recently, a promising early-stage pancreatic cancer biomarker, extracellular vesicles (EVs) related glypican-1 (GPC1) mRNA, is found to overexpress in pancreatic cancer cells. Current mRNA detection methods usually require expensive machinery, strict preservation environments, and time-consuming processes to guarantee detection sensitivity, specificity, and stability. Herein, we propose a novel two-step amplification method (CHAGE) via the target triggered Catalytic Hairpin Assembly strategy combined with Gold-Enhanced point-of-care-testing (POCT) technology for sensitive visual detection of pancreatic cancer biomarker. First, utilizing the catalyzed hairpin DNA circuit, low expression of the GPC1 mRNA was changed into amplification product 1 (AP1, a DNA duplex) as the next detection targets of the paper strips. Second, the AP1 was loaded onto a lateral flow assay and captured with the gold signal nanoparticles to visualize results. Finally, the detected results can be further enhanced by depositing gold to re-enlarge the sizes of gold nanoparticles in detection zones. As a result, the CHAGE methodology lowers the detection limit of mRNA to 100 fM and provides results within 2 h at 37 °C. Furthermore, we demonstrate the successful application in discriminating pancreatic cancer cells by analyzing EVs’ GPC1 mRNA expression levels. Hence, the CHAGE methodology proposed here provides a rapid and convenient POCT platform for sensitive detection of mRNAs through unique probes designs (COVID, HPV, etc.).

670080,"Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome: A review",2021-06-27,"The detection of nucleic acids by pattern recognition receptors is an ancient and conserved component of the innate immune system. Notably, RNA virus genomes are sensed by mammalian cytosolic RIG-I–like receptors, thereby activating interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression to restrict viral replication. However, recent evidence indicates that the cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway also protects against RNA viruses. So far, the mechanisms responsible for DNA sensing of RNA viruses, which replicate without known DNA intermediates, remain unclear. By using cGAS gene knockout and reconstitution in human and mouse cell cultures, we discovered that DNA sensing and cGAMP synthase activities are required for cGAS-mediated restriction of vesicular stomatitis virus and Sindbis virus. The level of cGAMP produced in response to RNA virus infection was below the threshold of detection, suggesting that only transient and/or low levels of cGAMP are produced during RNA virus infections. To clarify the DNA ligands that activate cGAS activity, we confirmed that cGAS binds mitochondrial DNA in the cytosol of both uninfected and infected cells; however, the amount of cGAS-associated mitochondrial DNA did not change in response to virus infection. Rather, a variety of pre-existing cytosolic DNAs, including mitochondrial DNA and endogenous cDNAs, may serve as stimuli for basal cGAS activation. Importantly, cGAS knockout and reconstitution experiments demonstrated that cGAS drives low-level ISG expression at steady state. We propose that cGAS-STING restricts RNA viruses by promoting a preparatory immune activation state within cells, likely primed by endogenous cellular DNA ligands. Many medically important RNA viruses are restricted by the cGAS-STING DNA-sensing pathway of innate immune activation. Since these viruses replicate without DNA intermediates, it is unclear what DNA ligand(s) are responsible for triggering this pathway. We show here that cGAS’s DNA binding and signaling activities are required for RNA virus restriction, similar to the mechanisms by which it restricts DNA viruses. Furthermore, we confirmed that cGAS continuously binds host DNA, which was unaffected by RNA virus infection. Finally, cGAS expression correlated with the low-level expression of interferon-stimulated genes in uninfected cells, both in vitro and in vivo. We propose that cGAS-mediated sensing of endogenous DNA ligands contributes to RNA virus restriction by establishing a baseline of innate immune activation.","Parker, Michael T.; Gopinath, Smita; Perez, Corey E.; Linehan, Melissa M.; Crawford, Jason M.; Iwasaki, Akiko; Lindenbach, Brett D.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/434027,626

Consequently, a large number of EM images of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 viruses with cells have been made available by numerous labs. However, due to EM recording techniques at high resolution, images of infection scenes are very noisy and they appear two dimensional (‘flat’). Current research consequently aims (A) at methods that can remove noise, and (B) at techniques that allow for recovering a 3D impression of the virus or its parts. Here we discuss a novel method which can recover a spatial impression of a whole infection scene at high resolution. In contrast to previous approaches which aim at the reconstruction of single spike proteins or a single virus, the here used method can be applied to a single noisy EM image of an infection scene. As one example image, we show a high resolution image of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in Vero cell cultures (Fig. 1). The method we use is based on probabilistic machine learning algorithms which can operate in a ‘zero-shot’ setting, i.e., in a setting when just one noisy image (and no large and clean image corpus) is available. The probabilistic method we apply can estimate non-noisy images by inferring first order statistics (pixel means) across image patches using a previously learned probabilistic image representation. Estimating higher order statistics and appropriately chosen probabilistic models then allow for the generation of images that enhance details and give a spatial impression of a full nanoscopic scene.","Drefs, Jakob; Salwig, Sebastian; Lücke, Jörg",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.25.432265,626
