However, there are times when input from a psychiatric specialist may be helpful in supporting the mental health care provided in primary care. Psychiatry eConsults can serve as a valuable tool in providing specialist advice for primary care physicians when direct referral to specialty care is not readily available. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to evaluate the content and implementation of psychiatric eConsults by primary care providers in a rural academic medical center. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of 343 eConsults placed between May 2016 and February 2019 by primary care providers at a single academic medical center. The content of eConsult requests, including patient diagnosis, consult question type, specialist recommendations, patient demographics, the distance of patient and primary care providers from the consulting provider, rate of implementation of the recommendation, and response time, were analyzed. RESULTS: The most common diagnoses associated with eConsults were depression (162/450, 36%) and anxiety (118/450, 26%). The most commonly asked eConsult question was regarding medication management, including medication choice, side effects, interactions, and medication taper (288/343, 84%). More than one recommendation was included in 76% (259/343) of eConsults, and at least one recommendation was implemented by the primary care provider in 94% (282/300) of eConsults. The average time to respond to an eConsult was 26 hours. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that psychiatry eConsults can be conducted in a timely manner and that primary care providers implement the recommendations at a high rate.","Avery, Jade; Dwan, Dennis; Sowden, Gillian; Duncan, Matthew",J Med Internet Res,716,1

However, the extent to which this is possible is unclear. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of telehealth on the use of hospital services, that is, (duration of) hospitalizations, and to compare the effects between telehealth types and health conditions. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library from inception until April 2019. Peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the effect of telehealth interventions on hospital service use compared with usual care were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool and quality of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation guidelines. RESULTS: We included 127 RCTs in the meta-analysis. Of these RCTs, 82.7% (105/127) had a low risk of bias or some concerns overall. High-quality evidence shows that telehealth reduces the risk of all-cause or condition-related hospitalization by 18 (95% CI 0-30) and 37 (95% CI 20-60) per 1000 patients, respectively. We found high-quality evidence that telehealth leads to reductions in the mean all-cause and condition-related hospitalizations, with 50 and 110 fewer hospitalizations per 1000 patients, respectively. Overall, the all-cause hospital days decreased by 1.07 (95% CI −1.76 to −0.39) days per patient. For hospitalized patients, the mean hospital stay for condition-related hospitalizations decreased by 0.89 (95% CI −1.42 to −0.36) days. The effects were similar between telehealth types and health conditions. A trend was observed for studies with longer follow-up periods yielding larger effects. CONCLUSIONS: Small to moderate reductions in hospital service use can be achieved using telehealth. It should be noted that, despite the large number of included studies, uncertainties around the magnitude of effects remain, and not all effects are statistically significant.","Peters, Guido M; Kooij, Laura; Lenferink, Anke; van Harten, Wim H; Doggen, Carine J M",J Med Internet Res,716,1

The potentially thin boundary between supervision and treatment requires constant attention, but there may be times when supervisors are called upon to become a support and an advocate and perhaps more. There could be no time this would become more true than during an international pandemic. The line between supervision and treatment could be constantly and consistently tested, as similar dynamics and a common reality resounded through the various roles and relationships. Social work and psychoanalytic training were essential to walking this line in such extraordinary circumstances by adherence to the principles of both. As in treatment, shared trauma and the required modifications made to the delivery system (telemedicine and tele-supervision) could challenge the frame. Also, as in treatment, adherence to the frame, with enhanced attention to the supervisee’s and supervisor’s own experience, is essential.","Cummins, Leslie","Shared Trauma, Shared Resilience During a Pandemic",716,14

It is known from the literature that a diff operation is required for the theory of arrays in order to enjoy the Craig interpolation property at the quantifier-free level. However, the diff operation introduced in the literature is merely instrumental to this purpose and has only a purely formal meaning (it is obtained from the Skolemization of the extensionality axiom). Our maxdiff operation significantly increases the level of expressivity; however, obtaining interpolation results for the resulting theory becomes a surprisingly hard task. We obtain such results via a thorough semantic analysis of the models of the theory and of their amalgamation properties. The results are modular with respect to the index theory and it is shown how to convert them into concrete interpolation algorithms via a hierarchical approach.","Ghilardi, Silvio; Gianola, Alessandro; Kapur, Deepak",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,716,1

In order to solve these inference problems, probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) employ different inference algorithms, such as sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), or variational methods. Existing research on such algorithms mainly concerns their implementation and efficiency, rather than the correctness of the algorithms themselves when applied in the context of expressive PPLs. To remedy this, we give a correctness proof for SMC methods in the context of an expressive PPL calculus, representative of popular PPLs such as WebPPL, Anglican, and Birch. Previous work have studied correctness of MCMC using an operational semantics, and correctness of SMC and MCMC in a denotational setting without term recursion. However, for SMC inference—one of the most commonly used algorithms in PPLs as of today—no formal correctness proof exists in an operational setting. In particular, an open question is if the resample locations in a probabilistic program affects the correctness of SMC. We solve this fundamental problem, and make four novel contributions: (i) we extend an untyped PPL lambda calculus and operational semantics to include explicit resample terms, expressing synchronization points in SMC inference; (ii) we prove, for the first time, that subject to mild restrictions, any placement of the explicit resample terms is valid for a generic form of SMC inference; (iii) as a result of (ii), our calculus benefits from classic results from the SMC literature: a law of large numbers and an unbiased estimate of the model evidence; and (iv) we formalize the bootstrap particle filter for the calculus and discuss how our results can be further extended to other SMC algorithms.","Lundén, Daniel; Borgström, Johannes; Broman, David",Programming Languages and Systems,716,25

PTS can have debilitating effects on patients' quality of life. Its symptoms range from pain and heaviness to venous ulceration. Treatment techniques that eliminate the thrombus burden from the lower extremity have been shown to reduce the incidence of postthrombotic symptoms by restoring venous patency to the iliofemoral venous system and preserving valvular function. Treatment techniques include operative thrombectomy, catheter-directed thrombolysis and pharmacomechanical thrombolysis. This paper focuses on the latter two techniques and reviews the evidence for adopting the strategy of thrombus removal in patients with iliofemoral DVT.","Comerota, Anthony J; Kamath, Vijay",Expert review of cardiovascular therapy,716,33

Although radical vaginal trachelectomy (RVT) is suggested as a fertility preserving approach, there are some serious concerns like cervical stenosis, second trimester loss, preterm delivery in survivors, and lack of residual tumor in the majority of the surgical specimens. Therefore, less radical surgical operations have been proposed in early-stage cervical carcinomas. On the other hand, single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is an evolving endoscopic approach for minimal access surgery. In this report, we present a case with early-stage cervical cancer who wishes to preserve fertility. We successfully performed single-port pelvic lymphadenectomy and large conization to preserve fertility potential of the patient. We think that combination of less radical approach like conization and single-port pelvic lymphadenectomy might be less minimally invasive and is still an effective surgical approach in well-selected cases with cervical carcinomas. Incorporation of single-port laparoscopy into the minimally invasive fertility sparing management of the cervical cancer will improve patients outcome with less complications and better cosmesis.

Rhein is a major component of the medicinal Rhubarb. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Rhein protects against renal injury and explore its underlying mechanism. METHODS 5/6 nephrectomization (5/6 Nx) was operated on Sprague-Dawley rats. Human kidney tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The level of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCr) was examined. Kidney tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to check the morphology. The cell viability was examined. The levels of cytokines and chemokines were measured by ELISA kit. The protein expression was determined by western blot. RESULTS Rhein significantly decreased SCr and BUN levels in 5/6 Nx rat. The morphologic findings indicated noteworthy amelioration of the damaged renal tissue in Rhein-treated rats. Rhein significantly protects HK-2 cells from LPS-mediated apoptosis. The productions of inflammatory signaling molecules (TNF-α, IL-6 and MCP-1) were inhibited by Rhein. LPS-induced NF-κB activation was also attenuated by Rhein via blocking its nuclear translocation by inhibiting phosphorylation of IκBα. CONCLUSION These findings provide evidence that Rhein protect against renal injury, and NF-κB signaling pathway is involved in this protective effect.","Liu, Meiyou; Wang, Lei; Wu, Xiaoxiao; Gao, Kai; Wang, Fan; Cui, Jia; Zhao, Jinyi; Peng, Li; Wang, Jingwen; Jia, Yanyan; Wen, Aidong",International urology and nephrology,716,24

Nowadays, four HCoVs, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63, are known to be circulating worldwide, causing upper and lower respiratory tract infections in nonhospitalized and hospitalized children. Studies of the fundamental aspects of these HCoV infections at the primary entry port, such as cell tropism, are seriously hampered by the lack of a universal culture system or suitable animal models. To expand the knowledge on fundamental virus-host interactions for all four HCoVs at the site of primary infection, we used pseudostratified HAE cell cultures to isolate and characterize representative clinical HCoV strains directly from nasopharyngeal material. Ten contemporary isolates were obtained, representing HCoV-229E (n = 1), HCoV-NL63 (n = 1), HCoV-HKU1 (n = 4), and HCoV-OC43 (n = 4). For each strain, we analyzed the replication kinetics and progeny virus release on HAE cell cultures derived from different donors. Surprisingly, by visualizing HCoV infection by confocal microscopy, we observed that HCoV-229E employs a target cell tropism for nonciliated cells, whereas HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 all infect ciliated cells. Collectively, the data demonstrate that HAE cell cultures, which morphologically and functionally resemble human airways in vivo, represent a robust universal culture system for isolating and comparing all contemporary HCoV strains.","Dijkman, Ronald; Jebbink, Maarten F; Koekkoek, Sylvie M; Deijs, Martin; Jónsdóttir, Hulda R; Molenkamp, Richard; Ieven, Margareta; Goossens, Herman; Thiel, Volker; van der Hoek, Lia",Journal of virology,716,1

The greatest burden is faced by those in low/middle-income countries (LMICs), where over 95% of deaths occur. Many of these deaths may be preventable through antenatal diagnosis and early intervention. This systematic literature review investigates the use of antenatal ultrasound to diagnose congenital anomalies and improve the health outcomes of infants in LMICs. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted using three search strings: (1) structural congenital anomalies; (2) LMICs; and (3) antenatal diagnosis. The search was conducted on the following databases: Medline, Embase, PubMed and the Cochrane Library. Title, abstract and full-text screening was undertaken in duplicate by two reviewers independently. Consensus among the wider authorship was sought for discrepancies. The primary analysis focused on the availability and effectiveness of antenatal ultrasound for diagnosing structural congenital anomalies. Secondary outcomes included neonatal morbidity and mortality, termination rates, referral rates for further antenatal care and training level of the ultrasonographer. Relevant policy data were sought. Results The search produced 4062 articles; 97 were included in the review. The median percentage of women receiving an antenatal ultrasound examination was 50.0% in African studies and 90.7% in Asian studies (range 6.8%-98.8%). Median detection rates were: 16.7% Africa, 34.3% South America, 34.7% Asia and 47.3% Europe (range 0%-100%). The training level of the ultrasound provider may affect detection rates. Four articles compared morbidity and mortality outcomes, with inconclusive results. Significant variations in termination rates were found (0%-98.3%). No articles addressed referral rates. Conclusion Antenatal detection of congenital anomalies remains highly variable across LMICs and is particularly low in sub-Saharan Africa. Further research is required to investigate the role of antenatal diagnosis for improving survival from congenital anomalies in LMICs.

TTE training is arduous and impacts on departmental output, and 30% of echo departments in England had no cardiac physiologists training in TTE in 2018. In the face of a waiting list crisis due to loss of accredited staff, we introduced a novel, multifaceted and integrated TTE training programme for Agenda for Change (AfC) band 5 cardiac physiologists in January 2018. The aim was to train these much more junior staff, who were largely naïve to echo, to BSE accreditation standard at twice our previous rate. Methods The training programme included (i) a foundation course with selection for further training on the basis of competence, (ii) an introductory scanning module, (iii) pathologyspecific training lists, (iv) training lists booked at reduced capacity (4 not 6 patients per list), (v) a complementary lecture programme, (vi) four levels of supervision with directions for both trainees and trainers of goals each week and (vii) ongoing review of progress. The primary end-point was the number of trainees per year achieving BSE accreditation standard compared to a historical control group (January 2010 to January 2018) in our hospitals. Secondary end-points include the impact of the training programme on departmental capacity and the duration of training. Results In the control period, 7 sonographers were trained to BSE accreditation in a mean of 31 months (range 24 to 48 months), a training rate of 1.0 accredited sonographer/year. These staff were all AfC band 6, began training at an average age of 30 years, had a median of 4.7 years of prior postgraduate experience in cardiac physiology (range 0.75 to 5.25 years), and 4 had past echo training experience elsewhere. From January 2018 to Jan 2021, 11 physiologists entered the new training programme. These trainees were an average age of 25 years, median AfC Band of 5.0 and had a median of 1.5 years (range 0.25 to 11 yrs) of postgraduate experience in cardiac physiology. The training programme reduced departmental core echo capacity by 16% in the second year of implementation. Core capacity was recovered in the third year as trainees completed the programme. TTE out-patient waiting lists were maintained at less than 6 weeks by support from out-of-hours' work. Four trainees did not complete the programme. Five physiologists achieved full BSE accreditation by January 2021, in an average of 27 months of training (range 22 to 34 months) with some delays due to the 2020 Covid pandemic. This represents a training rate to independent scanning of 1.7 sonographers per year on the new programme. Conclusion A programme of intensive training of echo-naïve very junior cardiac physiologists achieved a 70% increase in the rate of attainment of BSE accreditation compared to historical performance with training completed in a similar timescale. This level of performance exceeds the need outlined in the 2015 strategic review of cardiac physiologist training.","O039,; Toole, L.; Mackay, J.; Fent, G.; Watson, O.",Heart,716,20

The patient did not seek medical attention over these years as the degree of limitation of physical activity was modest. She had a bad obstetric history: five second trimester pregnancy losses and one early neonatal death. Her symptoms were worse during pregnancy and improved thereafter. Physical examination was notable of cyanosis and features of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Echocardiography was suggestive of double outlet right ventricle, large subaortic ventricular septal defect with bidirectional shunt, and severe PH. This case highlights a variable clinical outcome of Eisenmenger syndrome in pregnancy. We did a literature review for studies reporting the outcomes of PH in pregnancy. The overall mortality rates seem to have declined dramatically from as high as 56% reported in studies in the 1990s to < 5% in more contemporary studies. The common adverse obstetric outcomes include prematurity and growth restriction.

As such, it includes a summary and categorisation of the findings, extending to consumption preferences worldwide. After the indiscriminate stockpiling of food, which was witnessed in many countries following the implementation of the lockdown, the impact of COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease-2019) on consumer habits has inversely varied in function of personal attitudes, individual and household experiences, and characteristics. Specific contexts, and the financial, economic, and logistic nature of these contexts, have also been found to be of relevance in examining the research relating to the coronavirus pandemic and food-purchasing behaviour. Concurrent with the pandemic, some worldwide trends have emerged-home cooking has been rediscovered, leading to an increase in the demand for staple foodstuffs, and purchases from small, local retailers and online food shopping have been accorded preferential treatment. Despite price volatility and concern about future household incomes, a significant proportion of consumers have shifted to buying healthier, more sustainable food. Moreover, food wastage has seen a notable decrease in volume. Such an occasion should be strategically exploited by manufacturers and retailers in satisfying this consumer demand. Finally, the COVID-19 crisis would seem to offer an unparalleled opportunity to re-engineer the agro-food market by driving the transition toward more sustainable supply and production patterns. Thus, stronger and more equitable partnerships between farmers, manufacturers, retailers, and citizens may be in the process of being forged.","Borsellino, V.; Kaliji, S.

Some studies have shown that the virus can cause a higher mortality in people with weakened immune systems, such as the elderly, those taking immunosuppressive drugs, and those with underlying disorders, than in the general population. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic disorders who received biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The effect of precautionary selfisolation in these patients was also determined. Patients and Methods: This descriptive study involved 200 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and multiple sclerosis (MS) who were treated with biologic DMARDs. Patients with symptoms of the coronavirus infection were invited to have a COVID-19 test that involved a COVID-19 IgG antibody test or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test (i.e., nasal swab). Additionally, patients were asked about their precautionary self-isolation status during this period. Results: The mean age of the patients was 51.29 years +/- 13.38 years. The ratio of males to females was 27 to 173. Of the 200 patients included in the study, 156 (78%) had RA, 10 (5%) had SLE, and 34 (17%) had MS. Seventyfive percent of the patients used rituximab. Ten patients (5%) were symptomatic of COVID-19, although only four patients had a definitive diagnosis of the disease. All patients who were symptomatic of COVID-19 took rituximab. Ten percent of patients who did not observe the precautionary self-isolation period were diagnosed with COVID-19. Conclusion: Patients who receive biologic DMARDs have a lower risk of developing COVID-19 and a lower risk of mortality from the disease than the general population.","Ahmadzadeh, A.; Farsad, F.; Emam, M.

Besides costs for the cutting tools themselves, further costs appear - equipment downtime for tool changes, reworking of damaged surfaces, scrap parts or damages to the machine tool itself in the worst case. Consequently, tools need to be exchanged on a regular basis or at a defined tool wear state. In order to detect and monitor the tool wear state different approaches are possible. In this publication, a deep learning approach for image processing is investigated in order to quantify the tool wear state. In a first step, a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is trained for cutting tool type classification. This works well with an accuracy of 95.6% on the test dataset. Finally, a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) for semantic segmentation is trained on individual tool type datasets (ball end mill, end mill, drills and inserts) and a mixed dataset to detect worn areas on the microscopic tool images. The accuracy metric for this kind of task, Intersect over Union (IoU), is around 0.7 for all networks on the test dataset. This paper contributes to the perspective of a fully automated cutting tool wear analysis method using machine tool integrated microscopes in the scientific and industrial environment.","Bergs, Thomas; Holst, Carsten; Gupta, Pranjul; Augspurger, Thorsten",Procedia Manufacturing,716,24

On the other hand, treating this infection in psychiatric patients faces some challenges. Case Presentation: A case of the 2019-nCoV infection is reported in a patient who was admitted to the psychosomatic ward with a diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder. The patient had a history of numerous unexplained physical complaints, usually complained of some new physical symptoms when informed of the time of his discharge. Although the possibility of misdiagnosis was high, based on examinations and some paraclinical evaluations, the patient underwent a simultaneous diagnosis of COVID-19. Unlike usual, he did not complain of any new physical complaints after informing of the 2019-nCoV infection and was willing to be discharged. Some diagnostic and therapeutic challenges regarding 2019-nCoV infection in the patient were examined. Conclusions: There are three clinically relevant learning points to be noted from this case report. Firstly, the importance of paying attention to the patient’s complaints in any mental patient, even disorders related to unexplained physical complaints. Secondly, the introduction highlights the differences in the care of patients with COVID-19 between psychiatric and non-psychiatric patients and the need for a multidisciplinary approach. Third, this introduction identifies a crucial diagnostic role for CT thorax in symptomatic patients with suspected COVID-19 because the false-negative rate with RT-PCR COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swabs is high.","Salehian, R.; Esfahani, M.

In 2017, the Australian Government introduced an enhanced test and treat response. We evaluate the impact of this response and the potential impact of further expansion of testing interventions. Methods We developed a mathematical model to capture the transmission of infectious syphilis among young heterosexual Indigenous Australians aged 15-29 years living in regional and remote areas. We used the model to assess the impact of existing and hypothetical outbreak responses on infectious syphilis prevalence. Findings The increase in testing coverage achieved through the enhanced response (18% coverage in 2011, to 39% in 2019) could lead to a stabilisation of the epidemic from 2021. To return to the pre-outbreak level (<0.2%) within five years, testing coverage needs to reach 60%. With the addition of a biannual community-wide screening program, using outreach to test 30% of youth in communities over 6 weeks, a return to pre-outbreak levels can be achieved within 2 years. If testing coverage alone was scaled-up to 60% at the start of outbreak in 2011, syphilis prevalence would have returned to pre-outbreak levels by 2014. Interpretation Modelling suggests that to control the syphilis outbreak the response needs to be delivered with further potency. The reduction in prevalence could be hastened with community-wide screening at similar time periods across all communities along with increases in annual testing coverage.","Hui, B. B.; Ward, J.

Patients with confirmed COVID-19 at inclusion were followed by phone calls at day (D) D7, D14 and D28. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed to explore the association between obesity and other potential predictors for hospitalization. Results A total of 1,050 participants were screened, 310 were diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR. Median age was 37.4 (IQR 29.8-45.0) years, and 186 (60.0%) were female. Duration of symptoms was 3.0 (IQR 2.0-5.0) days, and 10.0 (IQR 8.0-12.0) was the median number of symptoms at inclusion. A total of 98 (31.6%) were obese, and 243 (78.4%) had no previous medical conditions. Twenty three participants (23/310, 7.4%) required hospitalization during the period.

Some categories of companies experienced and are still experiencing significant negative effects, while other businesses have been only marginally affected. A small group has noticed growing sales as well as occasional signals from the market that new products and services are needed in the near future. There are indications that small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) managers are considering social responsibility towards the employees of the companies. We would like to emphasize three different activities. Firstly, over 40% of all SME managers have during the pandemic partly abstained from salary and/or other special salary benefits. In the hotel and restaurant sector, this figure is 70% and for managers with foreign background 55% state that they have done such activities. Second, many SMEs have used governmental support to be able to keep their employed individuals part-time in the companies.

Methods: Five participants (four female) with RRMS between the ages of 38-64 with the following characteristics at baseline: Expanded Disability Status Scale 2.0-6.0, International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) > 7, Symbol-Digit Modality Test > 22, and no relapses or initiation of medications indicated to affect mobility within the past 30 days. Participants were asked to complete 12 weeks (one hour, twice per week) of the TBP. Magnetic resonance imaging data was collected pre- and post-intervention for SC and RSFC network analysis. Results: Increases in two RRMS-related graph theoretical measures (mean strength and mean clustering coefficient) for RSFC (p < 0.05) are detectable alongside significant reduction in ataxia (ICARS: p = 0.01012, Smoothness Index: p = 0.04995), increase in balance (Mini-BESTest: p = 0.01474) following participation in the well-tolerated TBP. Discussion and Conclusions: Significant increases in mean strength and mean clustering coefficient of RSFC suggest functional neurological improvements after participation in the TBP. The relationship between these network changes and clinical improvements in balance and amelioration of ataxia after participation in the TBP requires a larger randomized-controlled clinical trial of the TBP in persons with RRMS.","Camacho, P.

Although red meat is a heme-rich environment, L. sakei does not need iron or heme for growth, while possessing a heme-dependent catalase. Iron incorporation into L. sakei from myoglobin and hemoglobin was formerly shown by microscopy and the L. sakei genome reveals a complete equipment for iron and heme transport. Here, we report the characterization of a five-gene cluster (lsa1836-1840) encoding a putative metal iron ABC transporter. Interestingly, this cluster, together with a heme dependent catalase gene, is also conserved in other species from the meat ecosystem. Our bioinformatic analyses revealed that the locus might refer to a complete machinery of an Energy Coupling Factor (ECF) transport system. We quantified in vitro the intracellular heme in wild-type (WT) and in our Δlsa1836-1840 deletion mutant using an intracellular heme sensor and ICP-Mass spectrometry for quantifying incorporated 57Fe heme. We showed that in the WT L. sakei, heme accumulation occurs fast and massively in the presence of hemin, while the deletion mutant was impaired in heme uptake; this ability was restored by in trans complementation. Our results establish the main role of the L. sakei Lsa1836-1840 ECF-like system in heme uptake. This research outcome shed new light on other possible functions of ECF-like systems. Importance Lactobacillus sakei is a non-pathogenic bacterial species exhibiting high fitness in heme rich environments such as meat products, although it does not need iron nor heme for growth. Heme capture and utilization capacities are often associated with pathogenic species and are considered as virulence-associated factors in the infected hosts. For these reasons, iron acquisition systems have been deeply studied in such species, while for non-pathogenic bacteria the information is scarce. Genomic data revealed that several putative iron transporters are present in the genome of the lactic acid bacterium L. sakei. In this study, we demonstrate that one of them, is an ECF-like ABC transporter with a functional role in heme transport. Such evidence has not yet been brought for an ECF, therefore our study reveals a new class of heme transport system.","Verplaetse, Emilie; André-Leroux, Gwenaëlle; Duhutrel, Philippe; Coeuret, Gwendoline; Chaillou, Stéphane; Nielsen-Leroux, Christina; Champomier-Vergès, Marie-Christine",bioRxiv,716,1

We hypothesised that differential expression of genes encoding proteins proposed to be required for entry of SARS-Cov-2 in aged compared to younger cardiomyocytes might contribute to the susceptibility of older individuals to COVID-19-associated cardiovascular complications. We generated strand-specific RNA-sequencing libraries from RNA isolated from flow-sorted cardiomyocyte nuclei from left ventricular tissue. RNASeq data were compared between five young (19-25yr) and five older (63-78yr) Caucasian males who had not been on medication or exhibited evidence of cardiovascular disease post-mortem. Expression of relevant genes encoding ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRS11D, TMPRS11E, FURIN, CTSL, CTSB and B0AT1/SLC6A19 were upregulated in aged cardiomyocytes and the combined relative cardiomyocyte expression of these genes correlated positively with age. Genes encoding proteins in the RAAS and interferon/interleukin pathways were also upregulated such as ACE, AGTR1, MAS1 and IL6R. Our results highlight SARS-CoV-2 related genes that have higher expression in aged compared with young adult cardiomyocytes. These data may inform studies using selective enzyme inhibitors/antagonists, available as experimental compounds or clinically approved drugs e.g. remdesivir that has recently been rapidly accepted for compassionate use, to further understand the contribution of these pathways in human cardiomyocytes to disease outcome in COVID-19 patients.","Robinson, Emma L.; Alkass, Kanar; Bergmann, Olaf; Maguire, Janet J.; Roderick, H.

Often, patients and organizations are unwilling to divulge personal medical data for fear of compromising their privacy because although the data may be encrypted, the encrypted values typically need to be first decrypted to perform any computation on the data. Unfortunately, such a barrier in easy sharing of data can severely hamper the ability to respond in a timely and effective manner to a crisis scenario, as evident in the case of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To overcome this critical obstacle, we propose in this paper a novel privacy-preserving encryption mechanism for storage and computation of sensitive healthcare data. Our scheme is based on the use of a secure fully homomorphic encryption scheme, so that the required computations can be performed directly on the encrypted data values without the need for any decryption. The ability to execute queries or computation directly on encrypted data, without the need for decryption, is not present in any existing public-health surveillance system. We propose a novel computational model and also develop an algorithm for contact tracing with COVID-19 pandemic as a case study. We have simulated our proposed approach using the ElGamal encryption algorithm to check the correctness and effectiveness of our proposed approach. The results show that our proposed solution is effective in providing adequate security while supporting the computational needs for contact-tracing. Besides contact-tracing, our new data-encryption technique can have a much broader impact in the field of healthcare. By executing queries or computations directly on encrypted data, our innovative solution would make the sharing of data in healthcare-related research and industry significantly simpler and faster. The use of such a data encryption scheme to store and transmit sensitive healthcare data over a network can not only allay the fear of compromising sensitive information but also ensure HIPAA-compliance.","Sinha, K.; Majumder, P.; Ghosh, S.

They likewise aid in understanding current issues and events. Twitter has become an important virtual venue where global users hold conversations, share infor-mation, and exchange news and research. This study investigates social network structures among Twitter users with regard to the Covid-19 outbreak at its onset and its spread. The data were derived from two Twitter datasets by using a search query, “coronavirus,” on February 28th, 2020, when the coronavirus outbreak was at a relatively early stage. The first dataset is a collection of tweets used in investigating social network structures and for visualization. The second dataset comprises tweets that have citations of scientific research publications regarding coronavirus. The collected data were analyzed to examine numerical indicators of the social network structures, subgroups, influencers, and features regarding research citations. This was also essential to measure the statistical relationships among social elements and research citations. The findings revealed that individuals tend to have conversations with specific people in clusters regarding daily issues on coronavirus without prominent or central voice tweeters. Tweets related to coronavirus were often associated with entertainment, politics, North Korea, and business. During their conversations, the users also responded to and mentioned the U.S. president, the World Health Organization (WHO), celebrities, and news channels. Meanwhile, people shared research articles about the outbreak, including its spread, symptoms related to the disease, and prevention strategies. These findings provide insight into the information sharing behaviors at the onset of the outbreak. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion. All rights reserved.","Park, H.; Biddix, J. P.; Park, H.

We analyzed daily confirmed cases and deaths from different countries to understand the progression of the ongoing pandemic in different parts around the world. The data indicated that the pandemic is in different stages in different countries, where they are either at the end of the second wave or middle or early phase of it or still in the middle of the first wave of infection, and they can be divided into four groups. Type 1 countries such as UK, France, Spain, and the Netherlands are currently witnessing the second wave of infection with an exponential increase in daily cases. Countries such as Australia, United States, Japan, and Poland are currently in the declining stage of second-wave, grouped as Type 2 countries. Type 3 countries such as Germany, Italy, Belgium, and Russia are recently seeing the second wave with slowly rising of confirmed cases. Type 4 countries including India, Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico are currently fighting against the first wave of COVID-19. These countries have a chance to learn from the countries which have overcome the second wave successfully. To be ahead of the epidemic curve and preventing it, countries need to make future plans on family, hospital, and community levels. Isolation of the highly vulnerable elderly people and young children, preventing social or public gathering, following the guidelines of COVID-19 prevention including wearing face masks regularly can save countries from devastating effects of the second wave of pandemic COVID-19.","Bhumika, Prajapati Vora K.

This process was based on technological innovations under the heading of Industry 4.0, and more recently strengthened by the supply problems that came to light during the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although the social, political and institutional context matters a lot, we believe that technology is going to be a conditioning element in the ability of businesses to reconfigure the value chains in which they are involved. We propose a typology based on this technological perspective that could have considerable potential impact in defining business strategies in numerous industries and in orienting industrial policy in countries striving to acquire a more central role or to prevent themselves from being cut out of the global value chain.","Bilbao, Javier Camino-Beldarrain Vicente",Technology in Society,716,1

To support the molecular characterization of liquid biopsies for such DTP efforts, a set of myeloma-specific liquid biopsy approaches were developed. First, a hybrid selection panel was developed that detects somatic variants present in a patient's circulating-free DNA (cfDNA) in 70 commonly altered MM and Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential (CHIP) genes. For this MM 70-Gene cfDNA Assay, samples are received as blood in a StreckTM tube designed for stabilization of cfDNA and DNA is extracted from buffy coat using magnetic bead-based chemistry. Deep coverage sequencing (80,000x depth) is performed and duplex BAM files generated with UMI alignment and error correction allowing for sensitive detection of clinically relevant variants. Technical validation data on healthy donor cfDNA mixes was generated using samples with a range of cfDNA inputs. This data determined that the assay is capable of achieving >90% sensitivity for detecting somatic events present at 1% variant allele frequency with a specificity of <0.2 false positives per megabase. Using a clinical cohort, we observed a strong correlation between Bone Marrow Aspirate (BMA) and cfDNA samples with the vast majority of variants previously detected in BMA also identified via the MM-70 Gene panel analysis. Interestingly, we also saw evidence of additional somatic variants identified in cfDNA previously undetected in BMA analysis. Because one the aims of this effort is to return results to treating physicians, a clinical-grade (CLIA) pipeline was established. For that CLIA pipeline, the variants reported are a subset of all the events detected by the MM 70-Gene Assay. The events detected in the assay are reviewed by experienced molecular pathologists at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) who have developed a customized reporting process. These reports utilize an internally-developed knowledgebase of variant/gene annotations that leverages the DFCI expertise in hematologic malignancies and myeloma specifically. The reports are then provided back through providers to the patient via the CureCloud system for their use in clinical care and trial identification. In order to complement the MM-70 Gene panel with copy number and translocation information, we have been exploring Circulating Multiple Myeloma Cells (CMMCs). Our current approach involves automated capture of CMMCs using ferrofluids coated with MM-selective and discriminating antibodies to immunomagnetically enrich circulating plasma cells. The highly enriched CMMCs fractions generated in such a fashion are then submitted for molecular characterization. At the submission date of this abstract, 163 patients have been fully enrolled into CureCloud from which results will be presented. In summary, we have developed a robust and very sensitive clinical-grade next-gen liquid biopsy sequencing platform allowing for minimally invasive monitoring of MM disease genomics that can be used to complement other more classical approaches and to help support our Direct-To-Patient Initiatives. Especially in this post-COVID19 era, such liquid biopsy-based approaches that avoid clinic visits for the patients and can be performed through at-home mobile phlebotomy are emerging as important new options.

Therefore, the opinion of students with their first contact to a fully virtual education will be helpful to modify e-teaching to better suit the students' needs. Method: Four hundred seven medical students, in China, were recruited via social media and were asked to complete structured questionnaires, regarding technical and content aspects of their e-courses. Findings: Most issues reported were of technical nature, especially for students attending the school distantly and network instability/unavailability was frequently (52.48%). Moreover, the audio was less helpful than texts/images and the senior students were less satisfied with the technical (0.005) and content (p=0.001) aspects. They also were more critical of their teachers' performance (p=0.042). Clinical cases and scenarios also received the lowest score. Implications for research and practice: Overall students did not feel confident with the e-learning, comfortable implementing it to patients and were reluctant to embrace it. Both technical difficulties and understanding issues impeded international students from embracing e-learning medical teaching, in China and efforts need to be made to acclimatise them to this new reality.","Al-Gerafi, M.; Zhang, W.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, symptoms at first admission were questioned in adult patients who applied to the Covid Outpatient Clinic between 21 December 2020 - 22 January 2021. A total of 43 complaints were analyzed in PCR test positive and negative patients. Results: 273 (62.0%) first application and 167 (38.0%) control applications were included in the study. The PCR test was positive in 16.5% of the first admissions. The most common complaints in the first admissions with positive PCR test were fatigue (73.0%), headache (64.9%), pain (32.2%), cough (56.8%), sore throat (51.4%), loss of appetite (45.9%) while 15.9% of them were asymptomatic. Odd's rates of significant complaints for PCR positivity were calculated as 2.607 for fever, 2.724 for anorexia, 2.051 for cough, 2.594 for loss of smell, and 2.243 for loss of strength. Conclusions: COVID-19 is a disease that affects many organs and systems. Comparing the admission symptoms with the PCR test results will contribute to the recognition of the disease at the initial stage. Fever, anorexia, cough, loss of smell and loss of strength were found to be the distinguishing complaints of PCR positivity in our study.","Sahin, E.

This chapter shows how three central forms of parents’ time during the pandemic - time parents spent with children, for children, and toward safeguarding children’s futures - was upended. I illustrate how the pandemic transformed these aspects of time, increasing parents’ demands. First, the quality of time with children became more stressful, although potentially more enjoyable and meaningful as well. Second, the time spent for children’s provision - in paid and unpaid labor - increased to very high levels, in large part due to how children’s education demands moved into homes. Third, the time parents invest toward the safeguarding of children’s futures became more emotionally fraught. Notably, the increased demands and pressures related to parental time varied by social class and gender, exacerbating inequalities. Looking toward the future, there may be countervailing effects that lessen the blow of pandemic time stressors, as new meanings surrounding the value of spending time with and for children may develop among families and societies. Especially important for parental justice will be changes in societal supports for the healthy allocation of parents’ time with children, for children, and toward safeguarding their futures. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, J.

Case overview/synopsis: The case highlighted the predicament the government-owned Al-Ain City Hospital, United Arab Emirates, faced following the surge in the incidences of COVID-19 in the country in March 2020. The hospital management decided to initiate the work-from-home arrangement as a non-pharmaceutical intervention of handling the spread of the disease amongst its employees. Fatima Almur, the Information Technology Director in Al-Ain Hospital, asked the Application Support Manager, Aysha Shahwan, to deploy some IT tools significant for remote support to patient care within two weeks. Shahwan faced significant challenges in deploying the IT tools in two weeks given the diverse workforce, with the majority of them having limited knowledge in operating the tools, and hence, their apprehension in the usefulness of the tools. Besides, Shahwan had to deploy some advanced tools for easy and secured access to the electronic health record, telemedicine and telecommuting using mobile phones, tablets or PCs. The deployment of these advanced tools would be jeopardised by employee acceptance and consequent dwindling productivity. Considering the issue of employee acceptance of the change and their limited knowledge, Shahwan had, therefore, to develop training frameworks to boost the former’s perceived usefulness and ease-of-use of the IT tools. Will Shahwan successfully deploy the advanced IT tools to enable the hospital staff, including medical staff and departments, to ensure efficient patient care from a remote location? Will she be able to train the 600 employees across genders, ages and knowledge, use the IT tools and safeguard them from common software threats like email phishing and ransomware? Will the hospital be able to sustain its vision of quality patient care using advanced technologies through this new arrangement of remote support amidst the pandemic when patients are more?

Several factors are attributed to the increased risk of mood disorders and suicide. Not having pre-existing psychiatric or medical condition is not a protective factor, since suicide was attempted or committed due to external factors such as economic and social.ConclusionsThe pandemic has increased the risk of mood disorder and suicides in the population. Focus should be on the behavioral and psychological first aid to curb stress.","Shah, K.; Trivedi, C.; Mekala, H.",European Psychiatry,716,20

Bio-enrichment is a growing area of research, with particular interest in the use of fortified animal feed and/or UV exposure to naturally increase vitamin D content in meat(2). Since meat contributes the highest percentage to total vitamin D intake(3), enriched pork meat may offer a plausible vehicle for bio-enrichment. In Study 1, UVB exposure significantly increased serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations in the pigs (mid and endpoint, p < 0.05) but did not alter total vitamin D activity, vitamin D3 nor 25(OH)D3 concentration in pork meat compared to control (p > 0.05).","Neill, H.

This systematic review examined consistency in reporting of glioblastoma cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and assessed whether studies included patient characteristics in their survival analyses. Methods: We searched Embase and Medline on 02Feb21 for studies using preclinical models of glioblastoma published after Jan2008 that used data from TCGA to validate the association between at least one molecular marker and overall survival in adult patients with glioblastoma. Main data items included cohort characteristics, statistical significance of the survival analysis, and model covariates. Results: There were 58 eligible studies from 1,751 non-duplicate records investigating 126 individual molecular markers. In 14 studies published between 2017 and 2020 using TCGA RNA microarray data that should have the same cohort, the median number of patients was 464.5 (interquartile range 220.5-525). Of the 15 molecular markers that underwent more than one univariable or multivariable survival analyses, five had discrepancies between studies. Covariates used in the 17 studies that used multivariable survival analyses were age (76.5%), pre-operative functional status (35.3%), sex (29.4%) MGMT promoter methylation (29.4%), radiotherapy (23.5%), chemotherapy (17.6%), IDH mutation (17.6%) and extent of resection (5.9%). Conclusions: Preclinical glioblastoma studies that used TCGA for validation did not provide sufficient information about their cohort selection and there were inconsistent results. Transparency in reporting and the use of analytic approaches that adjust for clinical variables can improve the reproducibility between studies.","Fitt, B.; Loy, G.; Christopher, E.; Brennan, P.

In the context of a project taking a whole systems approach to tuberculosis infection prevention and control (IPC), we aimed to evaluate the potential impact of conventional and novel IPC measures on Mtb transmission to patients and other clinic attendees. Methods An individual-based model of patient movements through clinics, ventilation in waiting areas, and Mtb transmission was developed, and parameterised using empirical data from eight clinics in two provinces in South Africa. Seven interventions - co-developed with health professionals and policy-makers - were simulated: 1. queue management systems with outdoor waiting areas, 2. ultraviolet germicidal irradiation systems (UVGI), 3. appointment systems, 4. opening windows and doors, 5. surgical mask wearing by clinic attendees, 6. simple clinic retrofits, and 7. increased coverage of long antiretroviral therapy prescriptions and community medicine collection points through the CCMDD service. Results In the model, 1. outdoor waiting areas reduced the transmission to clinic attendees by 83% (interquartile range [IQR] 76-88%), 2. UVGI by 77% (IQR 64-85%), 3. appointment systems by 62% (IQR 45-75%), 4. opening windows and doors by 55% (IQR 25-72%), 5. masks by 47% (IQR 42-50%), 6. clinic retrofits by 45% (IQR 16-64%), and 7. increasing the coverage of CCMDD by 22% (IQR 12-32%). Conclusions The majority of the interventions achieved median reductions in the rate of transmission to clinic attendees of at least 45%, meaning that a range of highly effective intervention options are available, that can be tailored to the local context. Measures that are not traditionally considered to be IPC interventions, such as appointment systems, may be as effective as more traditional IPC measures, such as mask wearing.","McCreesh, N.; Karat, A.

Methods: We did this retrospective cross-sectional study among the 4765 patients consecutive adult inpatients admitted in the Covid 19 wards of a tertiary care hospital from May 1,2021 to July 7, 2021 during the second wave of Covid 19 pandemic. Information on basic demographic variables, RT PCR status, vaccination status, outcome and clinical severity of illness were obtained from the electronic hospital patient records. Results, and Interpretation & conclusions: Type of vaccine and number of doses of vaccines didnot have any protective effect against new SARS CoV-2 infection. Covid 19 patients vaccinated with at least one dose had 75 % less risk of requiring oxygen (OR 0.25 CI: 0.15 to 0.44) and 60 % less risk of ICU admission (OR 0.4 CI: 0.2 to 0.6) and it was statistically significant. Only 31 % of fully vaccinated Covid 19 positive patients had oxygen requirement (90% less risk) and 15% of the fully vaccinated patients had needed ICU admission (90% less risk).

Such phylodynamic inferences often complement or even substitute for conventional surveillance data, particularly when sampling is poor or delayed. It remains generally unknown, however, how robust phylodynamic epidemiological inferences are, especially when there is uncertainty regarding pathogen prevalence and sampling intensity. Here we use recently developed mathematical techniques to fully characterize the information that can possibly be extracted from serially collected viral phylogenetic data, in the context of the commonly used birth-death-sampling model. We show that for any candidate epidemiological scenario, there exist a myriad of alternative, markedly different and yet plausible “congruent” scenarios that cannot be distinguished using phylogenetic data alone, no matter how large the dataset. In the absence of strong constraints or rate priors across the entire study period, neither maximum-likelihood fitting nor Bayesian inference can reliably reconstruct the true epidemiological dynamics from phylogenetic data alone; rather, estimators can only converge to the “congruence class” of the true dynamics. We propose concrete and feasible strategies for making more robust epidemiological inferences from viral phylogenetic data.","Louca, Stilianos; McLaughlin, Angela; MacPherson, Ailene; Joy, Jeffrey B.; Pennell, Matthew W.",bioRxiv,716,1

After a period with almost no SARS-CoV-2 infections, a resurgent COVID-19 outbreak initiated mid June 2021. Possible reasons for the breakthrough were reduced vaccine effectiveness against the Delta variant, and waning immunity. The aim of this study was to quantify the extent of waning immunity using Israel national-database. Methods: Data on all PCR positive test results between July 11-31, 2021 of Israeli residents who became fully vaccinated before June 2021 were used in this analysis. Infection rates and severe COVID-19 outcomes were compared between individuals who were vaccinated in different time periods using a Poisson regression, stratifying by age group and adjusting for possible confounding factors. Results: The rates of both documented SARS-CoV-2 infections and severe COVID-19 exhibit a statistically significant increase as time from second vaccine dose elapsed. Elderly individuals (60+) who received their second dose in March 2021 were 1.6 (CI: [1.3, 2]) times more protected against infection and 1.7 (CI: [1.0, 2.7]) times more protected against severe COVID-19 compared to those who received their second dose in January 2021. Similar results were found for different age groups. Conclusions: These results indicate a strong effect of waning immunity in all age groups after six months. Quantifying the effect of waning immunity on vaccine effectiveness is critical for policy makers worldwide facing the dilemma of administering booster vaccinations.","Goldberg, Y.; Mandel, M.; Bar-On, Y.

The COVID-19 is rapidly spreading around the world due to its high infection rate. Therefore, early discovery of COVID-19 is crucial to better treat the infected person as well as to slow down the spread of this virus. However, the current solution for detecting COVID-19 cases including the PCR test, CT images, epidemiologically history, and clinical symptoms suffer from high false positive. To overcome this problem, we have developed a novel transfer deep learning approach for detecting COVID-19 based on x-ray images. Our approach helps medical staff in determining if a patient is normal, has COVID-19, or other pneumonia. Our approach relies on pre-trained models including Inception-V3, Xception, and MobileNet to perform two tasks: i) binary classification to determine if a person infected with COVID-19 or not and ii) a multi-task classification problem to distinguish normal, COVID-19, and pneumonia cases.

Therefore, we sought to investigate the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 following natural infection and following a single dose of AZD2221, in Sri Lankan individuals. Methods: Using Luminex assays, we characterized the IgG and IgA responses in patients with varying severity of illness and following a single dose of the vaccine at 4 weeks and 12 weeks since onset of illness or following vaccination. Haemagglutination test (HAT) was used to assess the antibodies to the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 wild type (WT), B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 (VOCs) and surrogate neutralizing test to measure ACE2 receptor blocking antibodies. Results: Those with mild illness and in vaccinees, the IgG responses to S1, S2, RBD and N protein increased from 4 weeks to 12 weeks, while it remained unchanged in those with moderate/severe illness. Those who had a febrile illness in 2017 and 2018 (controls) also gave IgG and IgA high responses to the S2 subunit. In the vaccinees, the most significant rise was seen for the IgG antibodies to the S2 subunit (p<0.0001). Vaccinees had several fold lower IgA antibodies to all the SARS-CoV-2 proteins tested than those with mild and moderate/severe illness at 4 weeks and 12 weeks. At 12 weeks the HAT titres were significantly lower to the B.1.1.7 in vaccinees and significantly lower in those with mild illness, and in vaccinees to B.1.351 and for B.1.617.2. No such difference was seen in those with moderate/severe illness. Conclusions: Vaccinees had significantly less IgA to SARS-CoV-2, but comparable IgG responses to those with natural infection. However, following a single dose, vaccinees had reduced antibody levels to the variants of concern (VOC), which further declined with time, compared to natural infection.","Jayathilaka, D.; Jeewandara, C.; Gomes, L.; Jayadas, T.; Kamaladasa, A.; Guruge, D.; Pushpakumara, P.; Ranasinghe, T.; Abayratne, I.; Danasekara, S.; Gunathilaka, B.; Kuruppu, H.; Wijewickrama, A.; Wijayamuni, R.; Schimanski, L.; Tan, T.; Ogg, G.; Townsend, A.; Malavige, G.

Mutated IDH enzymes generate the “oncometabolite” 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which inhibits TET2 function. IDH2 mutations have been reported in 9% to 19% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases. Inhibition of the mutant IDH2 enzyme led to decreased 2-HG levels and induced myeloid differentiation in IDH2 mutant AML. Enasidenib, a small-molecule inhibitor of mutant IDH2, was approved in 2017, after a successful phase I/II trial showing an overall response rate (ORR) of 40.3% in relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease, with 19.3% of patients achieving complete remission (CR). A Phase III trial is currently ongoing. It targets the mutant IDH2 variants R140Q, R172S, and R172K;at an approved dose of 100 mg oral daily dose. At higher doses the drug was less tolerated, however, few subjects received dose modification at the 650 mg daily dose group;these events did not qualify as a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). In this descriptive study, we are reporting a case series of R/R AML, with an IDH2 mutation, that are treated with escalated dose enasidenib. Method: This case series is based on retrospective observations of patients with R/R IDH2 mutant AML since January 2017, who are treated with enasidenib. We are reporting two cases treated with an escalated dose of 200 mg daily. We included patients with intermediate to poor-risk AML, who received at least one prior line of therapy, started on standard dose enasidenib (100 mg daily) for a minimum of 6 months and followed until disease relapse or death. We excluded patients who are primarily resistant to enasidenib (AML risk stratification and response evaluation by ELN-Leukemia NET. IDH2 mutations were identified by a local diagnostic laboratory that is regulated under CLIA through PCR which is validated to detect 10% or more mutant allele frequency. To quantify IDH2 variant frequency, confirmatory testing was performed via ARUP next-generation sequencing panel (NGS). Results: Here we report the descriptive outcomes of 2 cases from a single institution, who were treated with escalated dose enasidenib (200 mg oral daily) for R/R AML with an IDH2 mutation. The first case describes a 65-year-old female diagnosed with poor-risk AML in the setting of pancytopenia with bone marrow evaluation consistent with the background of erythroid and granulocytic dysplasia, with normal karyotype analysis. The patient has treated with induction chemotherapy and 2 cycles consolidation that was complicated with bacterial infections, prolonged hospitalization, and profound deconditioning led to stopping treatment. After 18 months of surveillance, repeat bone marrow evaluation for new-onset pancytopenia revealed relapsed AML with evidence of IDH2 mutation at codon 140, with a variant frequency of 36.9% by NGS. The case was started on enasidenib at 100 mg oral daily dose. After 6 months of therapy, the patient continued to be cytopenic, repeated bone marrow evaluation showed residual AML with IDH2 variant frequency of 27.6%. The decision was made to increase the enasidenib dose to 200 mg daily. With follow up for another 5 months on the escalated dose, the patient achieved hematologic complete response (hCR) with normalization of peripheral platelet count and ANC. [Figures 1-2] The patient maintained hCR for another 5 months on 200 mg enasidenib daily until she died from COVID-19 infection. The second case describes a 59-year-old female with poor-risk AML in the setting of leukocytosis, with bone marrow evaluation consistent with the background of megakaryocytic dysplasia and karyotype analysis positive for monosomy 7. The patient was treated with induction chemotherapy and failed to respond. Repeat bone marrow evaluation showed primary refractory disease with positive IDH2 mutation at codon 140 with a variant frequency of 40.7%. Treatment with 100 mg enasidenib was started. The patient maintained a partial response for 6 months, then peripheral blasts counts started to gradually increase. The deci ion was made to increase enasidenib dose to 200 mg daily, which improved peripheral blasts within one month of escalated dose therapy. [Figure 3] The patient maintained a response to therapy for another 3 months before she relapsed. Conclusion: Our limited data showed that initial response to standard dose enasidenib could potentially be optimized by dose escalation to 200 mg daily.

Early studies indicated that monoclonal antibody treatment in immunocompromised individuals could result in within-host viral evolution preferentially affecting epitopes recognized by these antibodies, although whether this signifies a real risk of transmissible antibody resistant virus is unclear. In this study we have taken advantage of a regional SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance program encompassing regions in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Iowa to monitor the introduction or de novo emergence of SARS-Cov-2 lineages with clinically relevant variants. Here we describe a newly acquired E484K mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein detected within the B.1.311 lineage. Multiple individuals in two related households were infected. The timing and patterns of subsequent spread were consistent with de novo emergence of this E484K variant in the initially affected individual who had been treated with bamlanivimab monotherapy. The subsequent transmission to close contacts occurred several days after the resolution of symptoms and the end of this patient's quarantine period. Our study suggest that the selective pressures introduced by the now widespread administration of these antibodies may warrant increased genomic surveillance to identify and mitigate spread of therapy-induced variants.","Sabin, A.

It is an established necessity that psychological support groups are jointly facilitated, which poses a challenge for lone Psychologists. In the context of COVID-19 and pressures on services, MDT members are less available to collaborate. Psychology referrals have increased and people with CF (PWCF) are at increased risk of social isolation. A virtual group was developed incorporating two CF services;addressing both the psychotherapeutic needs of PWCF and the need for collaboration of the lone Psychologists. Method: Two Psychologists from Glasgow and London adult CF centres connected online in June 2020. Similarities in therapeutic approach, experience of lone working, and need to increase outpatient contact were identified. Key themes to structure a series of groups were identified from Psychology referrals. The logistics of cross-NHS Trust working, GDPR, and IT issues were discussed and navigated. In January 2021 approval was given by stakeholders, including Information Governance. The group terms of reference and a pathway for patient recruitment and screening were developed. Results: Working as lone CF Psychologists can be isolating, with less opportunity for creativity. Collaborating has reduced isolation and made it possible to develop a virtual patient group. Regular meetings helped us stay connected and committed in a time of uncertainty and change. Our experiences mirror the anticipated benefits of the support group for PWCF. We hope to model this as facilitators. Conclusion: We present a way to overcome the barriers of isolation and lone-working to creatively collaborate on running virtual patient groups. This new service model presents opportunities for diversity and new ways of thinking. We hope that the group will help to reduce social isolation for PWCF in the same way it has done for two lone CF Psychologists.","McKenzie-Howat, E.; Patel, S.",Journal of Cystic Fibrosis,716,1

Methods: We used routinely collected surveillance and COVID-19 vaccination data to conduct a retrospective cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 infection incidence and vaccine effectiveness among LCTFs residents in eastern France between 15 January and 19 May 2021. Data from secondary RT-PCR screening were used to identify B.1.351 variants. Findings: Included in our analysis were 378 residents from five LCTFs: 287 (76%) females, with median (IQR) age of 89 (83-92) years. Two B.1.351 outbreaks took place in LTCFs in which more than 70% of residents had received two doses of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, which included 11 cases of severe disease and six deaths among those who had received two doses. Vaccine effectiveness (95% CI) seven days after the second dose of vaccine was 49% (14-69) against any infection with B.1.351 and 86% (67-94) against severe forms of COVID-19. In multivariable analysis, females were less likely to develop severe forms of disease (IRR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.20-0.63). Interpretation: We observed reduced vaccine effectiveness associated with B.1.351, as well as B.1.351 outbreaks in two LTCFs among individuals who had received two doses of vaccine.

We presented a process/methodology to estimate bed occupancy numbers from the prediction of COVID-19 positive and active cases using modified Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model for the contagion and FB-Prophet model for time series analysis. We used official data from the Government of Telangana bulletins for the COVID-19 pandemic up to December 31st, 2020 for our process/methodology. SIR modeling is more intuitive and explainable but requires a lot of trial and error and assumptions. The FB-Prophet prediction process is simple and accuracy is also better compared to SIR modeling.","Darapaneni, N.; Mahita, G. M.; Paduri, A. R.; Talupuri, S.

Meanwhile, companies are struggling to cope with the new and evolving security threats in telecommuting using old control methods. Specifically, there is an increased danger of hacking attacks in telecommuting environments. Furthermore, corporate concerns regarding telecommuting security have led to a questioning of existing control methods that no longer seem adequate. Significant research has been conducted on the factors that improve the effectiveness of corporate security policies, such as formal control, informal control, and extrarole behaviors. However, these studies did not consider telecommuting environments, which surged after the COVID-19 outbreak. Telecommuting loosens the physical control over employees and eliminates the collegial environment in which employees encourage each other to protect system information. This study determined how the factors that influence the effectiveness of existing information security policies behave in a telecommuting environment. Our study shows that specification and mandatoriness are the most important factors for an effective telecommuting security policy. We conclude that this sudden change in the working environment has rendered existing security controls obsolete, and specification and mandatoriness are likely to receive increasingly more attention in the growing field of telecommuting security policy.","Lee, C.; Lee, K.",Security and Communication Networks,716,1

We sought to identify whether there are distinct Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score trajectory-based subphenotypes in sepsis. Methods: We created 72-hour SOFA score trajectories in patients with sepsis from two diverse intensive care unit (ICU) cohorts. We then used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to compute patient similarities to capture evolving heterogeneous sequences and establish similarities between groups with distinct trajectories. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) was utilized to identify subphenotypes based on SOFA trajectory similarities. Patient characteristics were compared between subphenotypes and a random forest model was developed to predict subphenotype membership, within 6 hours of ICU arrival. The model was then tested on the validation cohort. Results: A total of 4,678 and 3,665 unique sepsis patients were included in development and validation cohorts. In the development cohort, four subphenotypes of organ dysfunction were identified: Rapidly Worsening (n=612, 13.08%), Delayed Worsening (n=960, 20.52%), Rapidly Improving (n=1,932, 41.3%) and Delayed Improving (n=1174, 25.1%). In-hospital mortality for patients within different subphenotypes demonstrated distinct patterns over time. Similar subphenotypes and their associated outcome patterns were replicated in the multicenter validation cohort. Conclusion: Four novel, clinically-defined, trajectory-based sepsis subphenotypes were identified and validated. Trajectory based subphenotyping is useful for describing the natural history of sepsis in the ICU. Understanding the pathophysiology of these differential trajectories may reveal unanticipated therapeutic targets for patients with sepsis and identify more precise populations and endpoints for the predictive enrichment of clinical trials.","Xu, Z.; Mao, C.; Su, C.; Siempos, I.; Torres, L.

The protein that plays a role in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells is the surface protein, or the Spike, which is thought to be the effective vaccine target to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Until December 2020, Indonesia has reported 106 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences identified from COVID-19 positive patients. The purpose of this study was to analyze the phylogenetic relationship of the Spike protein of the Indonesian isolates of SARS-CoV-2 Indonesian, as well as the virus mutations and their effects on changes in the amino acid. The 106 Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 genomes were downloaded from GISAID and the Spike nucleotide and amino acid sequences were analyzed by multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and mutation analysis using the ClustalW method. Phylogenetic trees were created using the Neighbor-Joining method in MEGA-X software. The results showed that 30 of the 106 Indonesian isolate SARS-CoV-2 Spike were 100% identical to the Wuhan-Hu-1, while the remaining 76 had experienced mutations at 1-4 sites. There were 43-point mutations in the Spike gene, 27 of which led to amino acid changes and four had not been reported in other countries. The global mutation D614G was found in 60 Indonesian isolates , of which West Java was the province with the most reports. The phylogenetic of Spike showed that the Indonesian samples have been divided into several branches that are far from Wuhan-Hu-1. This study indicates the possibility of differences in the protein structure of Indonesian isolate SARS-CoV-2 Spike that need to be further studied to manufacture a vaccine against the Indonesian strain of SARS-CoV-2.","Gaffar, S.; Rahmani, S.

Most often the respiratory system is affected, but COVID-19 can also entail pathological consequences on other organ systems. Athletes are especially at risk for cardiovascular complications but attention must also be paid to other organ systems (neurological, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal…) when treating an athlete. COVID-19 can cause myocardial damage among athletes that can be due to myocarditis, which is an important cause of sudden cardiac death among them. The following article describes an approach to return to play after COVID-19 for three different athlete groups: elite athletes, child athletes under 15 years old and highly active recreational athletes. We designed four groups according to the course of COVID-19: asymptomatic athletes, athletes with mild symptoms, moderate to severe or prolonged symptoms (≥ 14 days), and with severe disease that requires hospitalization.

A Study on Perceptions of Higher Education Students and Teachers in the UAF",13.725252,0.43965623,2020,"Purpose: This article considers the possibilities of and barriers to socialising tourism after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Such an approach allows us to transform tourism and thereby evolve it to be of wider benefit and less damaging to societies and ecologies than has been the case under the corporatised model of tourism. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual analysis draws on the theorisation of “tourism as a social force” and the new concept of “socialising tourism”. Using critical tourism approaches, it seeks to identify the dynamics that are evident in order to assess the possibilities for socialising tourism for social and ecological justice. It employs an Indigenous perspective that the past, present and future are interconnected in its consideration of tourism futures. Findings: COVID-19 has fundamentally disrupted tourism, travel and affiliated industries. In dealing with the crisis, borders have been shut, lockdowns imposed and international tourism curtailed. The pandemic foregrounded the renewal of social bonds and social capacities as governments acted to prevent economic and social devastation. This disruption of normality has inspired some to envision radical transformations in tourism to address the injustices and unsustainability of tourism. Others remain sceptical of the likelihood of transformation. Indeed, phenomena such as vaccine privilege and vaccine tourism are indicators that transformations must be enabled. The authors look to New Zealand examples as hopeful indications of the ways in which tourism might be transformed for social and ecological justice. Practical implications: This conceptualisation could guide the industry to better stakeholder relations and sustainability. Social implications: Socialising tourism offers a fruitful pathway to rethinking tourism through a reorientation of the social relations it fosters and thereby transforming its social impacts for the better. Originality/value: This work engages with the novel concept of “socialising tourism”. In connecting this new theory to the older theory of “tourism as a social force”, this paper considers how COVID-19 has offered a possible transformative moment to enable more just and sustainable tourism futures. © 2021, Freya Higgins-Desbiolles, Bobbie Chew Bigby and Adam Doering.","Higgins-Desbiolles, F.; Bigby, B.

Even with a working knowledge of EHR, it is difficult to know all the relevant codes related to a phenotype due to the large number of codes available. Traditional data mining approaches often require the use of patient-level data, which hinders the ability to share data across institutions to establish a cooperative and integrated knowledge network. In this project, we demonstrate that multi-center large-scale code embeddings can be used to efficiently identify relevant features related to a disease or condition of interest. Method: We constructed large-scale code embeddings for a wide range of codified concepts, including diagnosis codes, medications, procedures, and laboratory tests from EHRs from two large medical centers. We developed knowledge extraction via sparse embedding regression (KESER) for feature selection and integrative network analysis based on the trained code embeddings. We evaluated the quality of the code embeddings and assessed the performance of KESER in feature selection for eight diseases. Besides, we developed an integrated clinical knowledge map combining embedding data from both institutions. Results: The features selected by KESER were comprehensive compared to lists of codified data generated by domain experts. Additionally, features identified automatically via KESER used in the development of phenotype algorithms resulted in comparable performance to those built upon features selected manually or identified via existing feature selection methods with patient-level data. The knowledge map created using an integrative analysis identified disease-disease and disease-drug pairs more accurately compared to those identified using single institution data. Conclusion: Analysis of code embeddings via KESER can effectively reveal clinical knowledge and infer relatedness among diseases, treatment, procedures, and laboratory measurement. This approach automates the grouping of clinical features facilitating studies of the condition. KESER bypasses the need for patient-level data in individual analyses providing a significant advance in enabling multi-center studies using EHR data.","Hong, C.; Rush, E.; Liu, M.; Zhou, D.; Sun, J.; Sonabend, A.; Castro, V.

In Kazakhstan and other neighboring post-Soviet countries, a certain social imbalance is associated with the protracted transition period from the Soviet past to the social order and economy of the future. A widening gap exists between the countries of this region associated with geopolitics;for example, states have to choose the Western or Eastern geopolitical vector of development. Russia has a dramatic effect on the development, economy, and migration of neighboring states with a weaker economy. In this regard, the research focuses on the study of key drivers, factors, and reasons affecting this imbalance in the context of the social strata of Kazakhstan. Based on economic and statistical analysis methods, the study analyzes the current migration situation in Kazakhstan and the CIS region, assesses the level of adaptation of citizens of Kazakhstan to the changing environment and globalization that affects the young population;the mechanism of the influence of regional vectors of geopolitics on Kazakhstan is also determined. Apart from this, the current work examines the propensity of young people to migrate abroad (expressed using an integrated indicator) and provides a regression analysis of factors affecting its level. This allowed assessing the degree of influence of the youth unemployment rate and the general welfare of the country on the inclination to go overseas to find a better job. The paper concludes by arguing that the level of unemployment among the young population has a significant impact on its tendency to migrate. In particular, in Kazakhstan, migration abroad is primarily connected with the possibility to get better career prospects and living conditions provided by the host countries. The research results could be used to manage socio-political and socio-economic issues related to the migration of young people in Kazakhstan and neighboring countries and conduct further research related to analyzing macroeconomic indicators and other factors affecting migration processes. © 2021, Florida Gulf Coast University.

However, no standard definitions or indicators exist to assess acceptability, acceptability research with adolescents in LMICs is still limited, and no known reviews synthesise the evidence from Africa. We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed studies assessing intervention acceptability with young adults (aged 10-24) in Africa, published between January 2010 and June 2020. This paper maps and qualitatively synthesizes the scope, characteristics, and findings of these studies, including definitions of acceptability, methods used, the type and objectives of interventions assessed, and overall findings on adolescent acceptability. The review was carried out in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Key word searches generated 4692 unique records and 55 final eligible studies, assessing 60 interventions. Most studies were conducted in Southern Africa, of which 32 jointly in South Africa and Uganda. The majority of interventions assessed for acceptability could be classified as HIV or HPV vaccine interventions (10), E-health (10), HIV testing interventions (8), support group interventions (7) and contraceptive interventions (6). The objectives of most interventions were linked to SDG3, specifically to HIV and sexual and reproductive health. Acceptability was overall high among these published studies. 22 studies provided reasons for acceptability or lack thereof, some specific to particular types of interventions and others common across intervention types. Our review exposes considerable scope for future acceptability research and review work. This should include: extending acceptability research beyond the health (and particularly HIV) sector and to regions in Africa where this type of research is still scarce; including adolescents earlier, and potentially throughout the intervention process; further conceptualising the construct of acceptability among adolescents and beyond, and examining the relationship between acceptability and uptake.","Somefun, O.

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is said to be up to 95% effective against severe disease or death. We were able to demonstrate that an additional 9.8% of COVID-19 vaccine doses could theoretically be given if the residual vaccine within the reconstituted Pfizer vials after six doses are extracted were used. This could be achieved by aseptically combining this excess vaccine from multiple vials to achieve full 0.3ml doses. Methods: An observational study was conducted in April, 2021, at a mass vaccine site run by a community volunteer organization on Bainbridge Island, Washington. We measured the amount of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine that was left in 172 vials after six doses had been withdrawn per Centers for Disease Control (CDC) protocol. Results: A total of 30.68 ml of leftover vaccine was measured and discarded as medical waste. 1,036 doses were given from these vials. An extra 102 doses theoretically could have been given using the residual vaccine in the vials. This would have resulted in 9.8% additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine without requiring new vials. Conclusion: The ability to combine solution from reconstituted Pfizer vaccine vials to minimize waste and obtain additional doses of vaccine could result in an increase in the number of individuals that could be vaccinated worldwide without additional cost. Further studies to validate our findings are warranted. Clinical trials to study the feasibility, safety and efficacy of protocols using this excess vaccine should be considered.","Hubbard, S.

Design/methodology/approach: The analysis has used an unbalanced panel data set of 146 countries over the period 1981–2016, as well as the two-step system generalized methods of moment approach. Findings: The empirical analysis has suggested that non-resource tax revenue instability influences negatively non-resource tax revenue share of gross domestic product. The magnitude of this negative effect is higher in less developed countries than in relatively advanced countries. This negative effect materializes through public expenditure instability: non-resource tax revenue instability exerts a higher effect on non-resource tax revenue share as the degree of public expenditure instability increases. Finally, non-resource tax revenue instability exerts a higher negative effect on non-resource tax revenue share as economic growth volatility rises, inflation volatility increases and terms of trade instability increases. Research limitations/implications: The main policy implication of this analysis is that policies that help ensure the stability of non-resource tax revenue also contribute to improving countries’ non-resource tax revenue share. For example, governments’ measures that help cope with or prevent the severe adverse effects of shocks on economies (shocks that could translate into higher tax revenue instability) would ultimately help enhance countries’ tax revenue performance. Practical implications: The severity of the current COVID-19 pandemic shock (which is a supply and demand shock) and the macroeconomic uncertainty that it has generated – inter alia, in terms of economic growth instability, terms of trade instability, inflation volatility and public expenditure instability – are likely to result in severe tax revenue losses. Governments in both developed and developing countries would surely learn from the management of this crisis so as to prepare for possible future economic, financial and health crises with a view to dampening their adverse macroeconomic effects, including here their negative tax revenue effects. Originality/value: To the best of the author’s knowledge, this topic is being addressed in the empirical literature for the first time. © 2021, Sèna Kimm Gnangnon.","Gnangnon, S.

Materials and Methods: Two surveys were deployed online through social media (WhatsApp, LinkedIn, and Twitter) to medical students and instructors from all medical colleges in Saudi Arabia. The surveys include demographic data, tools used in the education process during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, tools used in students’ examination, and both groups’ opinions about these tools. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to analyze the items included in the survey. Responses were presented as frequencies and percentages. Results: Responses from medical colleges in Saudi Arabia were collected and analyzed with a response rate of 72.2%. Data from 518 students and medical instructors showed that online education transformation had a positive feedback from both students and instructors for theoretical sessions teaching with limitations in the practical and clinical sessions. Conclusion: Online education in medical schools is new in Saudi Arabia. This mandatory shift to online teaching made us aware of the importance of restructuring and implementing the medical curriculum to support virtual education, especially in practical and clinical sessions learning. © 2021 Journal of Nature and Science of Medicine ;Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.","Al-mazidi, S.

A human-centric heterogeneous multi-attribute decision-makionstructed based on Dempster-Shafer structures. The term ”human-centric” is emphasized here as the proposed framework encompasses aspects specific to human judgments, specifications, or evaluations. Considering the differences in DM backgrounds and preferences, our framework incorporates a heterogeneous decision environment. DST allows DMs to express decision information in a manner closely consistent with human cognition. A series of parameters capture the subjective attitudes of DMs in our framework, the embodiments of which are manifold: 1) they reveal the sensitivity of DMs to alternative ranks in the process of basic probability assignment generation from decision information;2) they reflect the tolerance of DMs to uncertainty in the process of weight calculation from belief entropy;and 3) they facilitate analysis of DMs in the decision process based on belief intervals. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a decision-making application for medical supplier selection in the context of COVID-19.","Fei, Liguo Feng Yuqiang Wang Hongli",Computers & Industrial Engineering,716,2

The gap between top-down and bottom-up approaches has widened, favoring divergences between centralized approaches and distributed solutions. The need to rethink rhythms, places, organizations and governance models emerged, together with the need to rethink the way we design and create relationships. This paper suggests the adoption of an empathic component in the governance of complex ecosystems to make them more resilient to unexpected phenomena such as Covid-19. The aim is to bring a design perspective while discussing the need for an 'empathic revolution', namely the adoption of empathy as a lever of innovation for communities, businesses, organizations, and governments. The hypothesis is to adopt empathy not only to understand the users' needs in the development of new products and services, but to extend its adoption also in organizational changes up to transformative processes. In the first part, empathy is described through an extra-disciplinary observation. The second part outlines how empathy has been adopted in the design field.

However, how these shifts affect microbial interactions and function is poorly understood. Unraveling such microbial community responses is key to understand their environmental distribution and resilience under current and future disturbances. Here, we used metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to investigate microbial community structure and transcriptional responses to prolonged ammonium deprivation and sulfide and nitric oxide toxicity stresses in a controlled bioreactor system mimicking coastal sediment conditions. Candidatus Nitrobium versatile, identified in this study as a sulfide-oxidizing denitrifier, became a rare community member upon ammonium removal. The methanotroph Ca. Methanoperedens nitroreducens showed remarkable resilience to both experimental conditions, dominating transcriptional activity of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). After the ammonium removal experiment, a novel methanotroph species that we have named Ca. Methylomirabilis tolerans outcompeted Ca. Methylomirabilis lanthanidiphila and the anaerobic ammonium oxidizer (anammox) Ca. Kuenenia stuttgartiensis outcompeted Ca. Scalindua rubra. At the end of the sulfide and nitric oxide experiment, a gammaproteobacterium affiliated to the family Thiohalobacteraceae was enriched and dominated transcriptional activity of sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase. Our results indicate that some community members could be more resilient to stresses than others in coastal ecosystems, leading to dynamic microbial community shifts and novel functional states. Methane and sulfide oxidation could be ecosystem functions preserved across the investigated disturbances, while differing nitrogen cycling pathways might be favored in response to stresses. Importance Coastal ecosystems are primary zones of biogeochemical cycling, processing inputs of nutrients both generated in situ and derived from land runoff. Microbial communities that inhabit costal sediments perform these biogeochemical reactions, but microbial responses to dynamic, periodic substrate deprivation and exposure to toxic compounds remain elusive. In this study, we sought to address this knowledge gap in a controlled bioreactor system, unraveling microbial metabolic pathways and monitoring microbial responses to stresses that might occur in costal sediments. We identified key microbial players and shifts in their abundance and transcriptional activity. Our results indicated that methanotrophs were particularly resilient to stresses, sulfide oxidizers differed in resiliency but the community maintained sulfide oxidation function across stresses, and that anaerobic ammonium oxidizing (anammox) bacteria were sensitive to substrate deprivation but could restore activity once favorable conditions were reestablished. These insights will help to understand and predict coastal ecosystem responses to future disturbances.","Martins, Paula Dalcin; Echeveste, Maider J.; Arshad, Arslan; Kurth, Julia; Ouboter, Heleen; Jetten, Mike S.

The COVID-19 pandemic has recently created challenges for both teachers and students, demanding new methodologies for remote learning. In Life Sciences, mixing online content with practical activities represents an even greater challenge. In Microbiology, the implementation of an active teaching methodology, the #Adopt project, based on the social network Facebook®, represents a great alternative to associate remote education with classroom activities. In 2020, the version applied in high school, “Adopt a Microorganism”, was adapted to meet the demands of emergency remote education due to the suppression of face-to-face activities caused by the pandemic. In the present study, we assessed how the change in methodology impacted the learning of Microbiology and the richness of the discourse of high school integrated to technical education in Business Administration of the Federal Institute of São Paulo, Campus Sorocaba. For that, three questionnaires related to the adopted microorganism species were applied. The responses of students in the 2019 and 2020 classes were compared in terms of content richness and multiplicity of concepts through the application of the Shannon diversity index, an approach usually used to assess biodiversity in different environments. The observed results suggest that remote learning provided students with a conceptual basis and richness of content equivalent to those achieved by students submitted to the hybrid teaching model. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the #Adopt project methodology can be used in both hybrid and remote models, indicating that it is a viable alternative not only for teaching Microbiology, but possibly for other areas of knowledge.","Cintra Armellini, Bárbara Rodrigues; La Luna, Alexandre; Bueris, Vanessa; de Almeida, Alisson Pinto; Tamais, Alicia Moraes; Júnior, Flávio Krzyzanowski; Hasten Reiter, Victor Samuel; Lellis-Santos, Camilo; de Cássia Café Ferreira, Rita",bioRxiv,716,1

Part of this canon involves the idea that virulence and free-living survival (a key component of transmission) may have different relationships in different host-parasite systems. Most examinations of the evolution of virulence-transmission relationships—theoretical or empirical in nature—tend to focus on the evolution of virulence, with transmission a secondary consideration. And even within transmission studies, the focus on free-living survival is a smaller subset, though recent studies have examined its importance in the ecology of infectious diseases. Few studies have examined the epidemic-scale consequences of variation in survival across different virulence-survival relationships. In this study, we utilize a mathematical model motivated by aspects of SARS-CoV-2 natural history to investigate how evolutionary changes in survival may influence several aspects of disease dynamics at the epidemiological scale. Across virulence-survival relationships (where these traits are positively or negatively correlated), we found that small changes (5% above and below the nominal value) in survival can have a meaningful effect on certain outbreak features, including the R0, and the size of the infectious peak in the population. These results highlight the importance of properly understanding the mechanistic relationship between virulence and parasite survival, as evolution of increased survival across different relationships with virulence will have considerably different epidemiological signatures.","Gomez, Lourdes M.; Meszaros, Victor A; Turner, Wendy C.; Ogbunugafor, C.

Living arrangements are not static, and they may change considerably in response to economic and health shocks. The South African context is particularly interesting to investigate because studies suggest that many households remain “stretched” between rural and urban nodes, and kin networks have been identified as an important source of support during times of hardship. We use descriptive methods to analyze mobility in anticipation of the “hard” (level 5) lockdown, when almost all economic and on-site teaching activity was suspended, and the subsequent easing to lockdown level 4. The data come from the largest South African non-medical rapid mobile survey conducted during COVID-19, which employed telephone interviews to survey a representative sample of 7074 adults drawn using a stratified sampling design. We find that during the first few months of the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, approximately 16 percent of adults in South Africa had moved into a different household. Most adults (82%) only moved once;those who moved twice were the most likely to have employment to return to, suggesting that these movers include circular labour migrants.

However, the full scale of inequalities may have been underestimated as most measures of excess mortality do not adequately account for varying age profiles of deaths between social groups. We measured years of life lost (YLL) attributable to the pandemic, directly or indirectly, comparing mortality across geographic and socioeconomic groups. Methods YLL for registered deaths in England & Wales, from 27th December 2014 until 25th December 2020, were calculated using 2019 single year sex-specific life tables for England & Wales. Panel time-series models were used to estimate expected YLL by sex, geographical region, and deprivation quintile between 7th March 2020 and 25th December 2020 by cause: direct deaths (COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases), cardiovascular disease & diabetes, cancer, and other indirect deaths - all other causes). Excess YLL during the pandemic period were calculated by subtracting observed from expected values. Additional analyses focused on excess deaths for region and deprivation strata, by age-group. Findings Between 7th March 2020 and 25th December 2020 there were an estimated 763,550 (95% CI: 696,826 to 830,273) excess YLL in England & Wales, equivalent to a 15% (95% CI: 14 to 16) increase in YLL compared to the equivalent time period in 2019. There was a strong deprivation gradient in all-cause excess YLL, with rates per 100,000 population ranging from (916; 95% CI: 820 to 1,012) for the least deprived quintile to (1,645; 95% CI: 1,472 to 1,819) for the most deprived. The differences in excess YLL between deprivation quintiles were greatest in younger age groups; for all-cause deaths, an average of 9.1 years per death (95% CI: 8.2 to 10.0) were lost in the least deprived quintile, compared to 10.8 (95% CI: 10.0 to 11.6) in the most deprived; for COVID-19 and other respiratory deaths, an average of 8.9 years per death (95% CI: 8.7 to 9.1) were lost in the least deprived quintile, compared to 11.2 (95% CI: 11.0 to 11.5) in the most deprived.

Motivated by planetary objects, we consider here a rapidly rotating fluid-filled spheroid, which is subject to weak perturbations of either the boundary (e.g. tides) or the rotation vector (e.g. in direction by precession, or in magnitude by longitudinal librations). Using boundary-layer theory, we determine the mean zonal flows generated by nonlinear interactions within the viscous Ekman layer. These flows are of interest because they survive in the relevant planetary regime of both vanishing forcings and viscous effects. We extend the theory to take into account (i) the combination of spatial and temporal perturbations, providing new mechanically driven zonal flows (e.g. driven by latitudinal librations), and (ii) the spheroidal geometry relevant for planetary bodies. Wherever possible, our analytical predictions are validated with direct numerical simulations. The theoretical solutions are in good quantitative agreement with the simulations, with expected discrepancies (zonal jets) in the presence of inertial waves generated at the critical latitudes (as for precession). Moreover, we find that the mean zonal flows can be strongly affected in spheroids. Guided by planetary applications, we also revisit the scaling laws for the geostrophic shear layers at the critical latitudes, and the influence of a solid inner core.","C'ebron, David; Vidal, J'er'emie; Schaeffer, Nathanael; Borderies, Antonin; Sauret, Alban",,716,26

This trial was conducted to determine whether a formula containing bovine lactoferrin (bLF) exerts a protective effect against EV71 or rotavirus infection among children from 2 to 6 years old. METHODS A prospective, randomized, single blind clinical trial of an oral supplement containing bLF (daily dose approximately 70 to 85 mg) was carried out with healthy children in a day care center from March 2002 to June 2003. The incidence of enterovirus or rotavirus infection and the serum level of interferon- gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were compared between children receiving and not receiving bLF. RESULTS A total of 172 children, 96 in group A, which received bLF, and 76 in group B which did not receive bLF, completed the trial. During the study period, no EV71 was isolated and seroconversion of EV71 antibodies was noted in only one child. Fourteen episodes of presumptive enterovirus infection and 12 episodes of presumptive viral enteritis were detected. No significant differences were observed between groups in the incidence of presumptive enterovirus infection or viral enteritis or the number of laboratory confirmed enterovirus or rotavirus infections. No significant differences were observed in the serum levels of IFN-γ and IL-10 between groups either prior to or following the trial.

However, no approved therapeutics or effective treatment is available for the treatment of these patients. The present study was done to retrospectively assess the treatment strategies (e.g., pharmaceutical care services) for COVID-19 patients in selected hospitals and highlight the importance of such services in the management of a pandemic. Materials and Methods Data from a series of COVID-19 patients (978 patients; 658 males [66.9%] and 324 females [33.1%]) admitted to the selected hospitals in Tehran from 20 February to 19 March 2020 were retrieved retrospectively from the Health Information System (HIS) of the hospitals. The statistical tests were used for analyzing the effect and correlation of the variables (drugs) with the average length of stay (ALOS) in the hospital. Results Diverse medication classes and old drugs with or without strong evidence of therapeutic effects against the novel coronavirus, some previously tried as a treatment for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, were mostly used for the treatment of patients in the hospitals. Many medications (broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals) or combination therapies are used without evidence of their therapeutic effects during pandemics. Conclusion Therefore, guidelines should be provided for the off-label use of these drugs by policymakers and stakeholders during a pandemic emergency due to high demands. Also, monitoring of the HIS data can play an important role in improving public health response to emerging diseases.","Najafi, Ali; Ghanei, Mostafa; Janbabaei, Ghasem; Velayati, Ali Akbar; Saadat, Seyed Hassan; Jamaati, Hamidreza; Tabarsi, Payam; Dastan, Farzaneh; Ram, Malihe; Darabi, Enayat; Fathi, Saeid; Gholami Fesharaki, Mohammad; Ghazale, Amir Hosein; Saloo, Shahrzad",Tanaffos,716,16

Of concern, neurological injury in this group remains poorly defined. Among high-risk and inoperable patients, subclinical injury is reported on average in 75% undergoing the procedure. Although this attendant risk may be acceptable in higher-risk patients, it may not be so in those of lower risk. METHODS AND RESULTS Forty patients undergoing TAVI with the Edwards SAPIEN-XT™ prosthesis were prospectively studied. Patients were of intermediate surgical risk, with a mean±standard deviation Society of Thoracic Surgeons score of 5.1±2.5% and a EuroSCORE II of 4.8±2.4%; participant age was 82±7 years. Clinically apparent injury was assessed by serial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale assessments, Montreal Cognitive Assessments (MoCA), and with the Confusion Assessment Method. These identified 1 (2.5%) minor stroke, 1 (2.5%) episode of postoperative delirium, and 2 patients (5%) with significant postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Subclinical neurological injury was assessed using brain magnetic resonance imaging, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences preprocedure and at 3±1 days postprocedure. This identified 68 new DWI lesions present in 60% of participants, with a median±interquartile range of 1±3 lesions/patient and volumes of infarction of 24±19 μL/lesion and 89±218 μL/patient. DWI lesions were associated with a statistically significant reduction in early cognition (mean ΔMoCA -3.5±1.7) without effect on cognition, quality of life, or functional capacity at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS Objectively measured subclinical neurological injuries remain a concern in intermediate-risk patients undergoing TAVI and are likely to manifest with early neurocognitive changes.

This was an exploratory qualitative study, which used the theoretical-methodological framework of the Discourse Analysis of French matrix, guided by the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research. The study was conducted in Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil. Seven participants were interviewed who were undergoing treatment at the time of the interview. The analysis of the participants' discourses allowed the emergence of four discursive blocks: (1) impact of the social determinants in the development of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, (2) barriers to seeking care and difficulties accessing health services, (3) perceptions of the side effects and their impact on multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment, and (4) tuberculosis and COVID-19: a necessary dialogue. Through discursive formations, these revealed the determinants of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Considering the complexity involved in the dynamics of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, advancing in terms of equity in health, that is, in reducing unjust differences, is a challenge for public policies, especially at the current moment in Brazil, which is of accentuated economic, political and social crisis. The importance of psychosocial stressors and the lack of social support should also be highlighted as intermediary determinants of health. The study has also shown the situation of COVID-19, which consists of an important barrier for patients seeking care.

Up to date there is little known regarding the impact of this outbreak on spinal specialists' daily clinical practice. We intended to evaluate how COVID-19 has affected the number of spinal disease patients we meet and operate in daily practice. Methods: The de-identified data regarding number of patients visiting the spine clinic at a tertiary referral hospital and a secondary level hospital from January, February and March of 2017 to 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The number of out-patient department (OPD) visits, number of emergency room (ER) visits as well as number of surgeries performed during the reviewed period were collected and analyzed, comparing 2020 to the previous 3 years. Results: The number of daily OPD visits showed a steady decrease starting from January, and presented a statistically significant decrease by early March 2020, compared to the previous 3 years. During the same period, decrease in number of daily ER visits was statistically significant as well. The number of elective surgeries or number of surgeries for patients admitted via ER during COVID-19 outbreak remained similar to that of 2017-2019 suggesting, despite the decrease of patients visiting the hospital for spinal diseases, those whom required surgery still visited the hospital. The results were consistant among other hospital level. Conclusion: The outbreak of COVID-19 affected our daily practice as OPD and ER visits reduced but did not affect the number of surgeries.

The aim of this study is to examine the feasibility of our evolution to a virtual format and report program attitudes toward the changes. METHODS: On March 15, 2020, due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) our institution restricted mass gatherings. We immediately transitioned all lectures to a virtual platform. The cancellation of elective surgeries in April 2020 then created the need for augmented resident education opportunities. We responded by creating additional lectures and implementing a daily conference itinerary. To evaluate the success of the changes and inform the development of future curriculum, we surveyed residents and faculty regarding the changes. Classes and faculty answers were compared for perception of value of the online format. RESULTS: Pre-COVID-19, residency-wide educational offerings were concentrated to one half-day per week. Once restrictions were in place, our educational opportunities were expanded to a daily schedule and averaged 16.5 hours/week during April. Overall, 41/63 residents and 25/94 faculty completed the survey. The majority of residents reported an increased ability (56%) or similar ability (34.1%) to attend virtual conferences while 9.9% indicated a decrease. Faculty responses indicated similar effects (64% increased, 32% similar, 4% decreased). PGY-1 residents rated the changes negatively compared to other trainees and faculty. PGY-2 residents reported neutral views and all other trainees and faculty believed the changes positively affected educational value. Comments from PGY1 and 2 residents revealed they could not focus on virtual conferences as it was not ""protected time"" in a classroom and that they felt responsible for patient care during virtual lectures. A majority of both residents (61%) and faculty (84%) reported they would prefer to continue virtual conferences in the future. CONCLUSIONS: The necessity for adapting our academic offerings during the COVID-19 era has afforded our program the opportunity to recognize the feasibility of virtual platforms and expand our educational offerings. The majority of participants report stable to improved attendance and educational value.

Although the virus infects those exposed indiscriminately, there are groups in society at an increased risk of severe infection, leading to increased morbidity. Patients suffering from hematological cancers, particularly leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma, may be one such group and previous studies have suggested that they may be at a three to four times greater risk of severe COVID-19 after SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to admissions to ICU, mechanical ventilation, and death compared to those without such malignancies. Serological testing for IgG seroconversion has been extensively studied in the immunocompetent, but fewer publications have characterized this process in large series of immunocompromised patients. This study described 20 patients with hematological cancers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR with 12 of the patients receiving further serological testing. We found that of the 12 patients screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, only 2 (16.6%) were able to generate an immune response to the infection. Yet despite this low seroconversion rate in this cohort, none of these patients died or became particularly unwell with COVID-19 or its related complications.","Bird, Paul W; Badhwar, Vinay; Kennedy, Ben; Ladani, Sapna; Tang, Julian W-T",J. med. virol,716,33

We sought to examine the literature in a systematic review manner on the outcomes of using ECMO postcardiac surgery. METHODS: A comprehensive electronic literature search was done to identify all the articles that have discussed the use of ECMO postcardiac surgery. The keywords and medical subject headings terms were used to identify the relevant articles. Studies have been screened according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. RESULTS: The identified studies have been summarized in each relevant section of this study. Cardiogenic shock postcardiac surgery can benefit from ECMO to varying degrees and the survival for this; otherwise, fatal condition has been shown to be improving through the use of ECMO. However, the decision and timing to initiate ECMO therapy remains selective and is dependent on a range of factors such as patient factor, clinician's judgment, meaning there is no consistent and solid ground regarding the timing of ECMO initiation. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that the circulatory support provided by ECMO improves survival rates for postcardiac surgery cardiogenic shock patients who are refractory to inotropic management, without such ECMO support patient mortality rates would be much greater.","Harahwa, Tinotenda; Chor, Cheryl Yan Ting; Harky, Amer",J Card Surg,716,13

Increasingly news articles and organizations have begun using the saliency of the COVID-19 crisis to highlight the link between animal agriculture, pandemic risks, and other widespread public health threats. Yet, little is known about the effectiveness of this messaging strategy for motivating dietary change. We conducted a randomized trial with an online sample to examine the impact of: (1) a message that uses the saliency of the COVID-19 pandemic to highlight the risk of disease transmission from factory farms, and (2) a message that uses the saliency of the COVID-19 pandemic to highlight the threat to worker's health created by factory farms. We examine whether these messages are more effective at changing beliefs about and behavioral intentions towards plant-based eating, as compared to more traditional messages that highlight the environmental, personal health, or animal welfare implications of factory farmed meat consumption. We find that all messages differentially influenced beliefs about the various negative consequences of meat consumption. However, these altered beliefs did not differentially motivate changes in respondents' intentions to reduce meat consumption and choose plant-based alternatives. This was possibly due to the numerous other barriers to behavior change identified in qualitative survey responses, such as cost, taste, and social factors. We did find that messages that highlight the personal health benefits of reduced meat consumption were more effective at increasing public trust in the message deliverer. Our results suggest that highlighting personal health benefits in messaging and addressing the additional identified barriers to behavior change may be critical for building trust and shifting the public towards plant-based diets.","Niemiec, Rebecca; Jones, Megan S; Mertens, Andrew; Dillard, Courtney",Appetite,716,16

In order to gain insights into SARS-CoV-2 evolution and drug targets, we investigated how and to what extent the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence differs from those of other well-characterized human and animal coronavirus genomes, as well as how polymorphic SARS-CoV-2 genomes are generally. We ultimately sought to identify features in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that may contribute to its viral replication, host pathogenicity, and vulnerabilities. Our analyses suggest the presence of unique sequence signatures in the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of betacoronavirus lineage B, which phylogenetically encompasses SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV as well as multiple groups of bat and animal coronaviruses. In addition, we identified genome-wide patterns of variation across different SARS-CoV-2 strains that likely reflect the effects of selection. Finally, we provide evidence for a possible host-microRNA-mediated interaction between the 3'-UTR and human microRNA hsa-miR-1307-3p based on the results of multiple computational target prediction analyses and an assessment of similar interactions involving the influenza A H1N1 virus. This interaction also suggests a possible survival mechanism, whereby a mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 3'-UTR leads to a weakened host immune response. The potential roles of host microRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 replication and infection and the exploitation of conserved features in the 3'-UTR as therapeutic targets warrant further investigation.IMPORTANCE The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is having a dramatic global effect on public health and the economy. As of October 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in over 189 countries, has infected over 40 million people, and is responsible for more than 1 million deaths. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is small but complex, and its functions and interactions with human host factors are being studied extensively. The significance of our study is that, using extensive SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis techniques, we identified potential interacting human host microRNA targets that share similarity with those of influenza A virus H1N1. Our study results will allow the development of virus-host interaction models that will enhance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and motivate the exploitation of both the interacting viral and host factors as therapeutic targets.","Chan, Agnes P; Choi, Yongwook; Schork, Nicholas J",MSphere,716,5

It is important to understand the unintended consequences of this approach to inform treatment decisions and the consideration of alternative treatments. Recent evidence has shown that ED opioid prescriptions are associated with future opioid use. The objective of this study was to measure the association of opioid administration in the ED to patients treated for back pain with future opioid use. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of opioid-naïve adults discharged from the ED with a diagnosis of back pain. Patients were stratified by opioid therapy (none, ED administration only, prescription only, or ED administration + prescription). Relative risks of ongoing opioid use (filling >90-day supply in 180 days following ED visit as documented in the prescription drug monitoring program) were calculated for each opioid-therapy group and compared to the no-opioid group. RESULTS: We identified 24,487 opioid naïve back pain patients. The median age was 38 years, 55% were female, and 56% were non-Hispanic white. A total of 41% received no opioid, 10% were only administered an opioid in the ED, 18% only received a prescription, and 31% received an opioid in the ED + prescription. The adjusted relative risks of ongoing use compared to the no opioid group were as follows: ED only 1.9, prescription only 2.1, and ED + prescription 2.3. The increased risk persisted for other definitions of ongoing use and after adjustment for baseline pain scores. CONCLUSIONS: For opioid-naïve patients with back pain, both administration of an opioid in the ED and opioid prescriptions are associated with a doubling of the risk of ongoing opioid use compared to patients not treated with opioids. This supports the consideration of minimizing exposure to opioids while treating back pain in the ED.","Heard, Kennon; Ledbetter, Caroline M; Hoppe, Jason A",Acad. emerg. med,716,1

Therefore, we decided early in the pandemic to suspend all elective cases of cardiac surgery and closed the ambulatory clinic. The effect of this strategy on the mental well-being of the non-COVID-19 patients is unknown. The aim of this study is to assess whether planned or operated patients suffered from either anxiety or depression by their altered medical care trajectory and if their score influenced decision-making. The findings intend to anticipate individual needs during subsequent waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The patient population consisted of two groups. The first group included planned patients whose operation date was delayed;in the second group, the postoperative control visit was postponed. Both groups received a twofold questionnaire. Part one was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, part two a series of questions on the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on cardiac surgical care from a patient's perspective. Results: The study population was composed of 46 patients (63% men). Most of them (82,6%) would like the surgery to be performed as fast as possible, even before the end of the first wave of COVID-19-related hospitalizations. Of all patients 30,4% have avoided to consult a physician because of fear and 34,8% consulted a physician by phone call. When they physically consulted a physician, there was a prominent role for the general practitioner (41,3% went to the GP vs 19,6% to the specialist). Most (58,7%) of the patients would have liked a (tele)consultation with the cardiac surgeon. Conclusions: Regardless of the HADS, one can state that a closer follow-up using telemedicine during the pandemic is expected by all patients. All patients prefer their surgery to take place even during a pandemic.","Welch, A.; Nijs, J.; Van Loo, I.; Mallefroy, M.; La Meir, M.",Acta Chirurgica Belgica,716,16

The COVID-19 pandemic has further disrupted communication between clinicians and their patients and families. The dependence on phone communication and the physical barriers of protective gear limit nonverbal communication and diminish clinicians' ability to recognize and respond to emotion. Developing new approaches to teach communication skills to trainees who are often responsible for communicating with patients and their families is challenging, especially during a pandemic or other crisis. ""Just-in-time"" simulation-simulation-based training immediately before an intervention-provides the scaffolding and support trainees need for conducting difficult conversations, and it enhances patients' and families' experiences. Using a realistic scenario, the author illustrates key steps for effectively using just-in-time simulation-based communication training: assessing the learner's understanding of the situation; determining what aspects of the encounter may prove most challenging; providing a script as a cognitive aid; refreshing or teaching a specific skill; preparing learners emotionally through reflection and mental rehearsal; coaching on the approach, pace, and tone for a delivery that conveys empathy and meaning; and providing specific, honest, and curious feedback to close a performance gap. Additionally, the author acknowledges that clinical conditions sometimes require learning by observing rather than doing and has thus provided guidance for making the most of vicarious observational learning: identify potential challenges in the encounter and explicitly connect them to trainee learning goals; explain why a more advanced member of the team is conducting the conversation; ask the trainee to observe and prepare feedback; choose the location carefully; identify everyone's role at the beginning of the conversation; debrief; share reactions; and thank the trainee for their feedback and observations.","Rock, Laura K",Acad. med,716,1

In pastoral and nomadic communities in the arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs), camels play a vital role in food security, while commercial milk production and formalized export markets are rapidly emerging as camel populations expand into non-traditional areas. Until recently, little focus was placed on camels as hosts of zoonotic disease, but the emergence of Middle Eastern respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and the discovery of exposure to the virus in Kenyan camels, highlighted the need for further understanding of this area. This systematised review utilised a robust search strategy to assess the occurrence of camel-associated zoonoses in Kenya and to evaluate the quality of the published literature. Seventy-four studies were identified, covering sixteen pathogens, with an increasing number of good quality studies in recent years.

Trypanosome spp., Echinococcus granulosus and Brucella spp. appeared most frequently in the literature. Pathogens with the highest reported prevalence were MERS-CoV (0-100%), Echinococcus granulosa (7-60%) and Rift Valley fever virus (7-57%). Exposure to Brucella spp., Coxiella burnetii and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus showed higher levels in camel or camel-associated vectors than other livestock species, although brucellosis was the only disease for which there was robust evidence linking camel and human exposure. Zoonotic agents with less severe human health outcomes, such as Dermatophilosus congolensis and contagious ecthyma, were also represented in the literature. This review provides an important summary of the scope and quality of current knowledge. It demonstrates that further research, and improved adherence to robust study design and reporting are essential if the zoonotic risk from camels in Kenya, and elsewhere, is to be better understood.","Hughes, Ellen Clare; Anderson, Neil Euan",,716,1

Objective. Herein, we have demonstrated the clinical manifestations, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of patients with severe Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia, as well as measures to ensure early diagnosis and intervention for improving clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Summary Background Data. The COVID-19 is a new infection caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome- (SARS-) like coronavirus that emerged in China in December 2019 and has claimed millions of lives. Methods. We included 37 severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients who were hospitalized at Taizhou Public Health Medical Center in Zhejiang province from January 17, 2020, to February 18, 2020. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory features; imaging characteristics; treatment history; and clinical outcomes of all patients were collected from electronic medical records. Results. The patients' mean age was 54 years (interquartile range, 43-64), with a slightly higher male preponderance (57%). The most common clinical features of COVID-19 pneumonia were fever (29 (78%)), dry cough (28 (76%)), dyspnea (9 (24%)), and fatigue (9 (24%)). Serum interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 were elevated in 35 (95%) and 19 (51%) patients, respectively. Chest computerized tomography scan revealed bilateral pneumonia in 35 (95%) patients. Early intervention with a combination of methylprednisolone and human immunoglobulin was highly effective in improving the prognosis of these patients. Conclusions. Progressive acute respiratory distress syndrome is the most common cause of death in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia owing to an uncontrolled inflammatory response. Early intervention with methylprednisolone and human immunoglobulin was highly effective in improving their prognosis.","He, Susu; Fang, Lina; Xia, Lingzhen; Lin, Shuangxiang; Ye, Junhui; Luo, Dinghai",Comput Math Methods Med,716,5

However, classical techniques like the Cox model cannot directly incorporate images due to their high dimensionality. We propose a deep learning approach that naturally incorporates multiple, time-dependent imaging studies as well as non-imaging data into time-to-event analysis. Our techniques are benchmarked on a clinical dataset of 1,894 COVID-19 patients, and show that image sequences significantly improve predictions. For example, classical time-to-event methods produce a concordance error of around 30-40% for predicting hospital admission, while our error is 25% without images and 20% with multiple X-rays included. Ablation studies suggest that our models are not learning spurious features such as scanner artifacts. While our focus and evaluation is on COVID-19, the methods we develop are broadly applicable.","Shu, Michelle; Bowen, Richard Strong; Herrmann, Charles; Qi, Gengmo; Santacatterina, Michele; Zabih, Ramin",,716,15

The stress and social isolation experienced during confinement add new threats to already vulnerable adolescents' daily lives. This study is aimed at determining which sociodemographic characteristics (age, family composition, achievement), confinement habits (schedule, new hobby, sleep duration, cellphone and computer use, sports, schoolwork), and sources of support (parents and teachers) are associated with more or less internalized symptoms in Canadian adolescents. Differences between boys and girls are also investigated. Between April 8 and 30 (2020) and through an online survey, 895 Canadian adolescents (74% girls) aged between 12 and 17 years (M = 14.7) were recruited. Path analysis was performed to identify significant associations between sociodemographic characteristics, confinement habits, support variables, and internalized symptoms. Independent samples t-tests and invariance tests were conducted to compare boys and girls. Results suggest that certain confinement habits (time spent using cellphones, doing sports and schoolwork, finding a new hobby) and support variables (parents working outside the home) were significantly and negatively associated with internalized symptoms. Regarding the sex differences, girls used their cellphones more and invariance test results showed that all associations between predictors and symptoms were statistically similar for boys and girls. This study's results help understand better adolescents' experience in confinement. It sheds light on the habits likely to characterize those who are less at risk of experiencing distress, making it possible to better support adolescents during this challenging period.","Tardif-Grenier, Kristel; Archambault, Isabelle; Dupéré, Véronique; Marks, Amy K; Olivier, Elizabeth",Psychiatr. q,716,23

A pool-testing approach may shorten the screening time and increase the test rate during times of limited test availability and inadequate reporting speed. Pool testing has been effectively used for a wide variety of infectious disease screening settings. Historically, it originated from serological testing in syphilis. During the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, pool testing is considered across the globe to inform opening strategies and to monitor infection rates after the implementation of interventions. AIMS: This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the global efforts to implement pool testing, specifically for COVID-19 screening. SOURCES: Data were retrieved from a detailed search for peer-reviewed articles and preprint reports using Medline/PubMed, medRxiv, Web of Science, and Google up to 21st March 2021, using search terms ""pool testing"", ""viral"", ""serum"", ""SARS-CoV-2"" and ""COVID-19"". CONTENT: This review summarizes the history and theory of pool testing. We identified numerous peer-reviewed articles that describe specific details and practical implementation of pool testing. Successful examples as well as limitations of pool testing, in general and specifically related to the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA and antibodies, are reviewed. While promising, significant operational, pre-analytical, logistical, and economic challenges need to be overcome to advance pool testing. IMPLICATIONS: The theory of pool testing is well understood and numerous successful examples from the past are available. Operationalization of pool testing requires sophisticated processes that can be adapted to the local medical circumstances. Special attention needs to be paid to sample collection, sample pooling, and strategies to avoid re-sampling.","Grobe, Nadja; Cherif, Alhaji; Wang, Xiaoling; Dong, Zijun; Kotanko, Peter",Clin. microbiol. infect,716,16

As the world mobilizes to contain the COVID-19, scientists and public health experts are increasingly alarmed about the potentially catastrophic effects of an outbreak in Africa. The establishment of Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention by the Africa Union in 2017 was an unprecedented move toward strengthening national responses, so far enabling all fifty member states with confirmed cases of COVID-19 to adequately respond, break chains of transmission and effectively contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We enter an uncertain and challenging period that may severely test the preparedness, organizational resource and resilience of African states and the fabric of their societies. However, we speculate that the fear associated with COVID-19 may also lead to some of the long-standing messages about simple measures to reduce the spread, such as hand washing, finally becoming absorbed and more universally adopted by health workers and the public. Is it possible that regardless of the terrible threat posed by SARS-CoV-2, the increased adoption of these health protection measures may result in a reduction in the spread of other infectious diseases?","Wadoum, Raoul Emeric Guetiya; Clarke, Andrew",Pan Afr Med J,716,1

IHEs also play a critical role in provision of accurate information related to COVID-19 to students and staff. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to assess available information on COVID-19 testing on IHEs' websites in the New York City (NYC) metropolitan area. IHEs' websites were screened for the presence of content related to COVID-19 testing. Larger institutions (> 10,000 students) were more likely than smaller institutions (&#8804; 5000 students) to provide information on how to make an appointment for COVID-19 testing (&#967;2(2) = 8.1, P < 0.05), and information on free testing (&#967;2(2) = 7.0, P < 0.05).

Smaller-sized institutions reported a significantly lower number of cases than medium- (P < 0.001) and large-sized (P = 0.003) institutions. Additional differences related to testing modalities and provision of information were observed according to schools' state jurisdictions.

METHODS: This study included 20 adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU of DHQ Hospital, Faisalabad (Pakistan). Patients were categorised into the survival group and the death group according to the outcome. We retrieved demographics, clinical manifestations and signs, laboratory indicators, treatment measures and clinical outcomes from the medical record, and summarised the clinical characteristics and outcomes of these patients. RESULTS: The average age of patients was 70 ± 12 years, of which 40% were male. They were admitted to the ICU 11 days after the onset of symptoms. The most common symptoms on admission were cough (19 cases, 95%), fatigue or myalgia (18 cases, 90%), fever (17 cases, 85%) and dyspnoea (16 cases, 80%). Eleven (55%) patients had underlying diseases, of which hypertension was the most common (11 cases, 55%), followed by cardiovascular disease (4 cases, 20%) and diabetes (3 cases, 15%). Six patients (30%) received invasive mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy and eventually died. Acute heart injury was the most common complication (19 cases, 95%). Ten (50%) patients died between 2 and 19 days after admission to the ICU. Compared with dead patients, the average body weight of surviving patients was lower (61.70 ± 2.36 vs 68.60 ± 7.15, P = .01), Glasgow Coma Scale score was higher (14.69 ± 0.70 vs 12.70 ± 2.45, P = .03), with fewer concurrent shocks (2 vs 10, P = .001) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (2 vs 10, P = .001). CONCLUSION: The mortality rate is high in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Lower Glasgow Coma Scale, higher body weight and decreased lymphocyte count appear to be potential risk factors for the death of patients with COVID-19 in the ICU.","Gul, Noor; Usman, Umer; Ahmed, Umair; Ali, Majid; Shaukat, Aamir; Imran, Mehar Muhammad",Int J Clin Pract,716,1

Time activities and use of home air pollution mitigation measures (use of room air cleaners (RACs), sealing of homes) were recorded by standardized diary. We compared PM2.5 exposure level by microenvironment (home (cooking), home (other activities), at work, commuting, other outdoor environment) in terms of averaged PM2.5 concentration and the contribution to cumulative personal exposure (the product of PM2.5 concentration and time spent in each microenvironment). Ambient PM2.5 measured at fixed-sites in the US Embassy and in Phora Durbar were 38.2% and 46.7% lower than during the corresponding period in 2017-2019. The mean concentration of PM2.5 to which US diplomats were exposed was very much lower than the concentrations of ambient levels measured at fixed site monitors in the city both before and during lockdown. Within-person comparisons suggest personal PM2.5 exposure was 50.0% to 76.7% lower during lockdown than before it. Time spent outdoors and cooking at home were large contributors to cumulative personal exposure. Low indoor levels of PM2.5 were achieved at work and home through use of RACs and measures to seal homes against the ingress of polluted air from outside. Our observations indicate the potential reduction in exposure to PM2.5 with large-scale changes to mainly fossil-fuel related emissions sources and through control of indoor environments and activity patterns.","Edwards, Leslie; Rutter, Gemma; Iverson, Leslie; Wilson, Laura; Chadha, Tandeep S; Wilkinson, Paul; Milojevic, Ai",Sci Total Environ,716,15

Generalized restriction of movement, together with unprecedented pressure on Health System, disrupted routine care for non-COVID-19 patients. Telemedicine has been promoted to reduce the risk of infections and to offer medical assistance to the restricted population. This paper is aimed to evaluate the impact of tele-consulting technology in a single bariatric center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our outpatient clinic reorganized the service from on-site to long-distance video consultations. All patients received a satisfaction questionnaire. The main goals were to evaluate patient compliance and to assess patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Of the 33 booked patients who were offered a teleconsultation, 19 (57.6%) participated in the video-call. No significant differences were found between participants and non-participants in terms of age and gender ratio. Urban area residents were 57.9% of the participants versus 42.8% of the non-participants group. Of the participants, 52.6% completed the survey reporting levels of satisfaction ranging from high to very high. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine has been advocated as a useful tool to relieve pressure on the overwhelmed Health Systems during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, e-health technologies are not yet widely adopted. Our initial experience, also compared with national data relating to the digital divide, suggests that the absence of basic computer skills and the lack of confidence with video-call systems may be patient-specific barriers for the implementation of telemedicine. In this context, telemedicine implementation can run up against various patient-related barriers, and several challenges remain for e-health to be integrated into outpatient practice.","Runfola, Matteo; Fantola, Giovanni; Pintus, Stefano; Iafrancesco, Mauro; Moroni, Roberto",Obes. surg,716,22

After an extensive literature review, it can be concluded that the greatest challenges were experienced in the food supply chain;industries were halted, but people needed enough food to survive. This study aimed to verify the impact of COVID-19 on the economy and food supply chain of Iraq. Six hypotheses were developed and data were collected from the Iraqi food supply chain. The data were cleaned and then analyzed through SmartPLS. It was found that COVID-19 has caused a high rate of inflation and decreased the human development index rate. Although several countries have lowered their interest rate, the advantages of this have failed to reach ordinary people. This study will help the government and managers in the food supply chain industry in their decision-making processes.

New Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which led to deaths as well as social and economic disruptions, is an ongoing worldwide pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, there is no approved treatment for COVID-19. Hence, only supportive care has been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) for now. Pharmacological agents used for the adjunctive treatment of COVID-19 following the current literature and clinical experiences include antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-malaria drugs, and other traditional or untraditional treatments. However, it has been reported that the use of these drugs may have some negative effects and comorbidities. Moreover, the current data have indicated that the risk of drug-drug interactions may also be high in polypharmacy cases, especially in elderly people, some comorbidity situations, and intensive care unit (ICU) patients. It is highly possible that these situations can not only increase the risk of drug-drug interactions but also increase the risk of food/nutrition-drug interactions and affect the nutritional status. However, this issue has not yet been entirely discussed in the literature. In this review, current information on the possible mechanisms as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of some pharmacological agents used in the treatment of COVID-19 and/or their secondary interactions with nutrition were evaluated and some future directions were given.","Agagündüz, Duygu; Çelik, Mensure Nur; Çitar Daziroglu, Merve Esra; Capasso, Raffaele",Nutrients,716,1

As a precautionary measure, many clinical studies halted enrollment during the initial surge of the global Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. In this case report, we detail the successful treatment of a relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM) patient treated with an anti-B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy immediately following clinical recovery from COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: The 57 year old Caucasian male patient had a 4-year history of MM and was considered penta-refractory upon presentation for CAR T cell therapy. He had a history of immunosuppression and received one dose of lymphodepleting chemotherapy (LDC) the day prior to COVID-19 diagnosis; this patient was able to mount a substantial immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and antiviral antibodies remain detectable 2 months after receiving anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy. The recent SARS-CoV-2 infection in this patient did not exacerbate CAR T-associated cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and conversely the CAR T cell therapy did not result in COVID-19-related complications. One month after CAR T cell infusion, the patient was assessed to have an unconfirmed partial response per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. CONCLUSION: Our case adds important context around treatment choice for MM patients in the era of COVID-19 and whether CAR T therapy can be administered to patients who have recovered from COVID-19. As the COVID-19 global pandemic continues, the decision of whether to proceed with CAR T cell therapy will require extensive discussion weighing the potential risks and benefits of therapy. This case suggests that it is possible to successfully complete anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy after recovery from COVID-19.

This is a pilot study of remote coaching and assessment of Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) manual skills in obstetrics and gynecology residents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PGY-3 obstetrics and gynecology residents participated in remote assessment of FLS manual skills using a live streaming platform. Learners who showed deficiencies in proficiency participated in live-streamed coaching sessions. The coaching sessions continued until the learner and coach mutually agreed that the learner was prepared for the skills portion of the FLS certification exam. The primary outcome was learner performance on skills assessment with external validation through the FLS manual skills exam pass rate. RESULTS: One learner demonstrated proficiency at baseline and the remaining nine underwent remote coaching sessions. Learners received a mean of two coaching sessions to reach mutually agreed readiness for the FLS exam as per learner and coach. All residents performed significantly better at the conclusion of the remote coaching series (11.3 ± 0.82) as compared to their baseline scores (8.8 ± 2.82) (P < .03; 95% CI, 0.31-4.69). Proficiency was externally validated through the FLS exam taken by each resident 1-2 weeks following their final assessment, with all learners passing the manual portion. The average satisfaction of learners with remote coaching was 77/100 (range 50-100). 100% of learners felt prepared for their FLS certification exam and 100% would recommend this remote training program to a colleague. CONCLUSION: Remote coaching and assessment of FLS skills yields similar results to traditional face-to-face instruction.","Miles, Shana; Donnellan, Nicole",Mil. med,716,13

The apelin-APJ receptor pathway has been implicated in HF, making it a promising therapeutic target. APJ has been shown to be activated by a novel endogenous peptide ligand known as Elabela (ELA, also called Toddler or Apela), with a critical role in cardiac development and function. Activation of the ELA-APJ receptor axis exerts a wide range of physiological effects, including depressor response, positive inotropic action, diuresis, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and anti-remodeling, leading to its cardiovascular protection. The ELA-APJ axis is essential for diverse biological processes and has been shown to regulate fluid homeostasis, myocardial contractility, vasodilation, angiogenesis, cellular differentiation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, cardiorenal fibrosis, and dysfunction. The beneficial effects of the ELA-APJ receptor system are well-established by treating hypertension, myocardial infarction, and HF. Additionally, administration of ELA protects human embryonic stem cells against apoptosis and stress-induced cell death and promotes survival and self-renewal in an APJ-independent manner (X receptor) via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, which may provide a new therapeutic approach for HF. Thus, targeting the ELA-APJ axis has emerged as a pre-warning biomarker and a novel therapeutic approach against progression of HF. An increased understanding of cardiovascular actions of ELA will help to develop effective interventions. This article gives an overview of the characteristics of the ELA-apelin-APJ axis and summarizes the current knowledge on its cardioprotective roles, potential mechanisms, and prospective application for acute and chronic HF.","Ma, Zheng; Song, Juan-Juan; Martin, Sara; Yang, Xin-Chun; Zhong, Jiu-Chang",Heart fail. rev,716,22

It is currently unknown whether immunosuppressive drugs are advantageous or detrimental in patients with COVID-19. Immunosuppressive drugs could be harmful in the initial phase of COVID-19. In this phase, the host immune response is necessary to inhibit viral replication. However, immunosuppressive drugs might have a beneficial effect in the later, more severe phase of COVID-19. In this phase, an overshoot of the host immune response (the “cytokine storm”) can cause ARDS, multiorgan failure and mortality. Aim: To summarize the available evidence on the effect of immunosuppressive drugs on infection with SARS-CoV-2. The effects of immunosuppressive drugs on similar pandemic coronaviruses may resemble the effects on SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we also included studies on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Methods: The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (registration number CRD42020181137). We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies with a control group and case-control studies concerning humans ≥ 18 years old. We also included in-vitro studies and animal studies with a control group. Results and Conclusion: Sixty-nine studies were included. Interestingly, MPA inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in-vitro. Clinical studies are needed to confirm the inhibitory effect of MPA on SARS-CoV-2 replication in-vivo. There are indications that corticosteroids and IL-6 inhibitors, like tocilizumab, can reduce mortality and prevent mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19. However, observational studies have contradictory results and the risk of bias is high. Thus, these results have to be confirmed in high-quality clinical trials before these drugs can be implemented as standard care. Based on the positive results of CNIs, mTOR inhibitors and thiopurine analogues in in-vitro studies with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it would be interesting to investigate their effects on SARS-CoV-2 replication.","Schoot, Tessa S.; Kerckhoffs, Angèle P.

Policy makers keep going medical legislation reforms. The effectiveness of legislation reforms to reduce malpractice litigation risk is uncertain. Objective: To determine whether medical legislation reform helps reduce the risk of medical litigation. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective study used national data obtained from Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan. The period analyzed was from 1987 to 2018. The annual medical litigation rate was determined, types of medical negligence litigation were compared, medical appraisal results were summarized, and the importance of medical legislation was identified. Interventions: After legislation reform vs before legislation reform. Measurements: The main outcome showed trends in medical dispute assessments over time by adjusting for the general population (per 1, 000, 000 people). We established 2004 and 2012 as the 2 cut-points for further analysis of medical appraisal results due to legislation reform. Results: With legislation reforms, the annual medical litigation rate decreased from 26.68 cases per million people in 2012 to 16.41 cases per million people in 2018. The annual medical litigation rate declined by approximately 38% from 2012 to 2018. Medical appraisal results were malpractice cases in 22.1% before Medical Care Act (2004 Reform) compared with 18.8% from 2004 to 2012 (odds ratio [OR], 0.82;95% CI, 0.727– 0.924;p=0.001), and 6.4% after mediation system introduced in 2012 (odds ratio [OR], 0.243;95% CI, 0.205– 0.288;p&lt; 0.001).

In this paper, we propose a population vaccination game framework, called EPROACH, to design policies for reopenings that guarantee post-opening public health safety. In our framework, a population of players decides whether to vaccinate or not based on the public and private information they receive. The reopening is captured by the switching of the game state. The insights obtained from our framework include the appropriate vaccination coverage threshold for safe-reopening and information-based methods to incentivize individual vaccination decisions. In particular, our framework bridges the modeling of the strategic behaviors of the populations and the spreading of infectious diseases. This integration enables finding the threshold which guarantees a disease-free epidemic steady state under the population's Nash equilibrium vaccination decisions. The equilibrium vaccination decisions depend on the information received by the agents. It makes the steady-state epidemic severity controllable through information. We find out that the externalities created by reopening lead to the coordination of the rational players in the population and result in a unique Nash equilibrium. We use numerical experiments to corroborate the results and illustrate the design of public information for responsible reopening.","Liu, Shutian; Zhu, Quanyan",,716,24

In this work we propose new Weisfeiler-Leman AMR similarity metrics that unify the strengths of previous metrics, while mitigating their weaknesses. Specifically, our new metrics are able to match contextualized substructures and induce n:m alignments between their nodes. Furthermore, we introduce a Benchmark for AMR Metrics based on Overt Objectives (BAMBOO), the first benchmark to support empirical assessment of graph-based MR similarity metrics. BAMBOO maximizes the interpretability of results by defining multiple overt objectives that range from sentence similarity objectives to stress tests that probe a metric's robustness against meaning-altering and meaning-preserving graph transformations. We show the benefits of BAMBOO by profiling previous metrics and our own metrics. Results indicate that our novel metrics may serve as a strong baseline for future work.","Opitz, Juri; Daza, Angel; Frank, Anette",,716,21

COVID-19 pandemic added more and more stress to healthcare workers in particular, depending on their work position. Objective: To assess mental health outcomes among HCWs dealing with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients. Methods: This is cross-sectional, hospital-based survey study conducted between Feb 6 and April 28, 2021. A total of 548 HCWs participated in the study. Mental health impact was assessed by using the 9- item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to determine the risk factors of mental health outcomes. Results: Among the 548 HCWs surveyed;64.8% were nurses and 50.0% aged from 26-30 years old. About 52.0% worked in Benha University Hospital, 21.2% worked in Toukh Fever Hospital, and 26.8% worked in Qaha Central Hospital. A considerable proportion of HCWs had symptoms of anxiety, depression and insomnia. Nurses, workers aged from 26-30, those working in Qaha Central Hospital and those who had shift hours from 7–10 experienced more severe symptom levels of depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Nurses were associated with severe symptoms of anxiety, depression and insomnia. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic represents a new working challenge for HCWs and intervention strategies to prevent depression and anxiety to reduce the risk of adverse mental health outcomes are needed.

India also strictly implemented a countrywide lockdown, starting from 24 March to 12 May 2020. This measure resulted in the reduction of the sources of air pollution in general: industrial, commercial, and vehicular pollution in particular, with visible improvement in ambient air quality. In this study, the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the ambient concentration of air pollutants over the city of Bangalore (India) is assessed using Continuous Ambient Air Quality Measurement (CAAQM) data from 10 monitoring stations spread across the city. The data was obtained from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB). The analysis of the relative changes in the ambient concentration of six major air pollutants (NO, NO2, NOX, PM2.5, O3, and SO2) has been carried out for two periods: March-May 2020 (COVID-19 lockdown) and the corresponding period of 2019 during when there was no lockdown. The analysis revealed significant reduction in the concentration of ambient air pollutants at both daily and monthly intervals. This can be attributed to the reduction in sources of emission; vehicular traffic, industrial, and other activities. The average reduction in the concentration of NO, NO2, NOX, PM2.5, and O3 between 01 March and 12 May 2020 was found to be 63%, 48%, 48%, 18%, and 23% respectively when compared to the same period in 2019. Similarly, the comparative analysis of pollutant concentrations between pre-lockdown (01-23 March 2020) and lockdown (24 March-12 May 2020) periods has shown a huge reduction in the ambient concentration of air pollutants, 47.3% (NO), 49% (NO2), 49% (NOX), 10% (SO2), 37.7% (PM2.5), and 15.6% (O3), resulting in improved air quality over Bangalore during the COVID-19 lockdown period. It is shown that the strict lockdown resulted in a significant reduction in the pollution levels. Such lockdowns may be useful as emergency intervention strategies to control air pollution in megacities when ambient air quality deteriorates dangerously.","Gouda, K C; Singh, Priya; P, Nikhilasuma; Benke, Mahendra; Kumari, Reshama; Agnihotri, Geeta; Hungund, Kiran M; M, Chandrika; B, Kantha Rao; V, Ramesh; S, Himesh",Environ Monit Assess,716,1

Refugees have mainly to face their adaption in a host country, which involves bureaucracy, different culture, poverty, and racism. The already fragile situation of refugees becomes worrying and challenged in the face of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic. Therefore, we aimed to describe the factors that can worsen the mental health of refugees. METHOD: The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in three electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Embase. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. RESULTS: According to the literature, the difficulties faced by refugees with the COVID-19 pandemic are potentiated by the pandemic state. There are several risk factors common to coronavirus and psychiatric illnesses as overcrowding, disruption of sewage disposal, poor standards of hygiene, poor nutrition, negligible sanitation, lack of access to shelter, health care, public services, and safety. These associated with fear and uncertainty create a closed ground for psychological sickness and COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: There should be not only a social mobilization to contain the virus, but also a collective effort on behalf of the most vulnerable populations.","Júnior, Jucier Gonçalves; de Sales, Jair Paulino; Moreira, Marcial Moreno; Pinheiro, Woneska Rodrigues; Lima, Carlos Kennedy Tavares; Neto, Modesto Leite Rolim",Psychiatry Res,716,16

While sustained transmission chains of human-to-human transmission suggest high basic reproduction number R 0, variation in the number of secondary transmissions (often characterised by so-called superspreading events) may be large as some countries have observed fewer local transmissions than others. Methods: We quantified individual-level variation in COVID-19 transmission by applying a mathematical model to observed outbreak sizes in affected countries. We extracted the number of imported and local cases in the affected countries from the World Health Organization situation report and applied a branching process model where the number of secondary transmissions was assumed to follow a negative-binomial distribution. Results: Our model suggested a high degree of individual-level variation in the transmission of COVID-19. Within the current consensus range of R 0 (2-3), the overdispersion parameter k of a negative-binomial distribution was estimated to be around 0.1 (median estimate 0.1; 95% CrI: 0.05-0.2 for R0 = 2.5), suggesting that 80% of secondary transmissions may have been caused by a small fraction of infectious individuals (~10%). A joint estimation yielded likely ranges for R 0 and k (95% CrIs: R 0 1.4-12; k 0.04-0.2); however, the upper bound of R 0 was not well informed by the model and data, which did not notably differ from that of the prior distribution. Conclusions: Our finding of a highly-overdispersed offspring distribution highlights a potential benefit to focusing intervention efforts on superspreading. As most infected individuals do not contribute to the expansion of an epidemic, the effective reproduction number could be drastically reduced by preventing relatively rare superspreading events.","Endo, Akira; Abbott, Sam; Kucharski, Adam J; Funk, Sebastian",Wellcome Open Res,716,16

It is well established that normal functioning is partially culturally defined and understood with reference to culturally expected responses to daily life. However, when a radical and unprecedented situation occurs, as in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, these expectations become less clearly defined, and any categorical account of mental disorder becomes obscured. We argue that, in the midst of this pandemic, traditional hierarchies between the clinician and their client are challenged, because categorical interpretations of mental disorder are less applicable. We use this observation to argue that incidents like the COVID-19 pandemic reveal the ambiguity and permeability of the divide between normal and abnormal functioning, while recommending more humanistic perspectives on individual distress.","Calder, Alexander J.; Novak, Lukas F.; Lane, Alexandra",J.

The main regimes we study are, the free spread of the virus, the quarantine and partial relaxation and the last one is the relaxation regime. The main model we use is SIR which is a classical model, but because we can not fully trust the numbers of infected or recovered we base our analysis on the number of deceased people which is more reliable. To actually deal with this we introduce a simple modification of the SIR model to account for the deceased separately. This in turn will be our base for fitting the parameters. The estimation of the parameters is done in two steps. The first one consists in training a neural network based on SIR models to detect the regime changes. Once this is done we fit the main parameters of the SIRD model using a grid search. At the end, we make some predictions on what the evolution will be in a timeframe of a month with the fitted parameters.","Petrica, Marian; Stochitoiu, Radu D.; Leordeanu, Marius; Popescu, Ionel",,716,30

METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed from available studies investigating serum vitamin D levels and vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms in glaucoma patients and controls. RESULTS: Twelve studies in total, including 130,676 and 476 subjects, were analysed for the association between serum vitamin D levels and VDR polymorphisms with glaucoma, respectively. Collectively, it was found that glaucoma patients have lower levels of vitamin D compared to controls (SMD=-1.16, 95% CI=-1.56--0.76, P<0.00001). In parallel, the pooled results showed a significant association between glaucoma and allelic (b vs. B, OR=1.84, 95% CI=1.37-2.46, P=0.00001) and recessive (bb vs. Bb+BB, OR=3.16, 95% CI=1.30-7.66, P=0.001) models of VDR BsmI (rs1544410) polymorphism, but not with VDR TaqI (rs731236) or FokI (rs2228570) polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that patients with glaucoma may have vitamin D deficiency. In addition, the vitamin D signalling cascade may be a contributing factor in developing glaucoma, which is supported by the evidence that b allele carriers of VDR BsmI exhibited an increase in the risk of glaucoma. Thus, dietary supplementation of vitamin D may become an important approach as an additional treatment for glaucoma.","Ulhaq, Z S",,716,10

We studied the repurpose of genistein, which could prevent sickle hemoglobin from polymerizing under hypoxic conditions in this disease. Genistein an important nutraceutical molecule found in soybean. The present study examines the repurposing genistein as an anti- sickling agent. Genistein shows inhibition of Hb S polymerization as well as a sickle reversal. Also, we have explored the interaction of the genistein with sickle hemoglobin (Hb S), using fluorescence, far-UV-CD spectroscopy, MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST), FTIR, combined with molecular modeling computations. The quenching constant decreases with increasing temperature, a characteristic that coincides with the static type of quenching mechanism. Temperature-dependent fluorescence measurements and molecular modeling studies reveal that apart from the hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions also play a crucial role in genistein and Hb S complex formation. In silico, distribution prediction of adsorption, digestion, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/Tox) based on physical and chemical properties show that genistein is nontoxic and has ideal drug properties. The helicity and thermophoretic mobility of Hb S was a change in the presence of genistein, which leads to the destabilizing the Hb S polymer was examined using CD and MST, respectively.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, significant increases in close-to-home LTPA raised concerns for public health and land managers alike. This project illustrates a novel, integrated monitoring approach to estimating COVID-19 risk exposure during trail-related LTPA, with implications for other public spaces. Methods COVID-19 risk exposure was conservatively calculated from the integration of in-person observations of LTPA trail groups and automated monitoring of trail traffic volumes in spring 2020. Trained observers tracked 1,477 groups. Traffic volume estimates and observed distance data were integrated, considering occlusion and total trail traffic volume. Results 70% of groups had one or more encounters. Among individual users, 38.5% were 100% compliant across all events observed but 32.7% were not compliant. Considering trail traffic volumes and annual daily traffic volume, exposure to risk of COVID-19 was conservatively estimated at 61.5% among individual trail users. Conclusions Monitoring opportunities and challenges of health risk exposure exist. Adjusted exposure measures based on volume counts can approximate numbers of unique individuals exposed, inform management actions, efficacy and policy decisions.","Schneider, Ingrid Lindsey Greg Petesch Michael Wynveen Christopher J.; Budruk, Megha Hendricks Bill Gibson Heather Shinew Kim Stein Taylor VanderWoude Deonne",Journal of Transport &amp; Health,716,29

Cardiovascular involvement can also occur, such as thrombosis or myocarditis, generally associated with pulmonary lesions. Little is known about SARS-CoV-2-induced myocarditis. We report the case of a 69-year-old man suffering from a refractory cardiogenic shock, without significant lung involvement. Prior to death, several nasopharyngeal swabs and distal bronchoalveolar lavage were sampled in order to perform RT-PCR analyses for SARS-CoV-2-RNA, which all gave negative results. Autopsy showed coronary atherosclerosis, without acute complication. Microscopic examination of the heart revealed the existence of an intense multifocal inflammatory infiltration, in both ventricles and septum, composed in its majority of macrophages and CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD4/CD8 ratio: 0.11). Immunohistochemistry for anti-SARS nucleocapsid protein antibody was strongly positive in myocardial cells, but not in lung tissue. RT-PCR was realized on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung and heart tissue blocks: only heart tissue was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In conclusion, this exhaustive post-mortem pathological case study of fulminant myocarditis demonstrates the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in heart tissue, without significant lung involvement. Immunohistochemistry showed that the virus was specifically localized in cardiomyocytes and induced a strong cytotoxic T cells inflammatory response. This case report thus gives new insight in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-induced myocarditis and emphasizes on the importance and reliability of post-mortem analyses in order to better understand the physiopathology of this worldwide spreading new viral disease.","Gauchotte, Guillaume; Venard, Véronique; Segondy, Michaël; Cadoz, Cyril; Esposito-Fava, Aude; Barraud, Damien; Louis, Guillaume",Int J Legal Med,716,20

By making them main actors in the management of this health crisis, they have been exposed to various psychosocial risks (stress, trauma, fatigue, etc). Paradoxically, stress-related symptoms are often underreported in this vulnerable population but are potentially detectable through passive monitoring of changes in speech behavior. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the use of rapid and remote measures of stress levels in health professionals working during the COVID-19 outbreak. This was done through the analysis of participants' speech behavior during a short phone call conversation and, in particular, via positive, negative, and neutral storytelling tasks. METHODS: Speech samples from 89 health care professionals were collected over the phone during positive, negative, and neutral storytelling tasks; various voice features were extracted and compared with classical stress measures via standard questionnaires. Additionally, a regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: Certain speech characteristics correlated with stress levels in both genders; mainly, spectral (ie, formant) features, such as the mel-frequency cepstral coefficient, and prosodic characteristics, such as the fundamental frequency, appeared to be sensitive to stress. Overall, for both male and female participants, using vocal features from the positive tasks for regression yielded the most accurate prediction results of stress scores (mean absolute error 5.31). CONCLUSIONS: Automatic speech analysis could help with early detection of subtle signs of stress in vulnerable populations over the phone. By combining the use of this technology with timely intervention strategies, it could contribute to the prevention of burnout and the development of comorbidities, such as depression or anxiety.","König, Alexandra; Riviere, Kevin; Linz, Nicklas; Lindsay, Hali; Elbaum, Julia; Fabre, Roxane; Derreumaux, Alexandre; Robert, Philippe",J Med Internet Res,716,20

AIM: This study reports and summarizes the homeopathic symptoms observed in 18 confirmed/suspected epidemiologically related cases in cluster outbreaks of COVID-19 in Hong Kong in early 2020. METHODS: Homeopathic symptoms from this case series were collected from 18 consecutive patients who, in addition to their concurrent conventional treatment or traditional Chinese medicine, actively sought help from homeopathy as an adjunctive measure for symptomatic relief from COVID-19. Cases were categorized according to outbreak clusters, focusing mainly on the homeopathic symptoms. In the analysis, frequency of all homeopathic medicines, common rubrics in all the cases, common rubrics in each of the top-ranked remedies, and differentiating symptoms for each top-ranked remedy were determined. RESULTS: Homeopathic symptoms of 18 cases, each identified as mild and belonging to one of six separate clusters, are reported. Eighteen common symptoms screened out of 79 selected rubrics constituted two sets of homeopathic symptom pictures: Bryonia alba (n = 4) and Gelsemium sempervirens (n = 12).

Loss of protein structure is described by two reaction coordinates: conformational disorder of the polymer and wetting by the solvent. These establish a competition between conformational entropy and hydrophobic interaction favoring random coil or globular states, respectively. Based on the Landau theory of phase transition, the resulting free energy barrier is found to decrease linearly with the temperature difference T-Tm, and the inactivation rate should scale as U to the power of T-Tm. This form recalls an accepted model of thermal damage to cells in hyperthermia. For SARS-CoV-2 the value of U in Celsius units is found to be 1.32. Although the fitting of the model to measured data is practically indistinguishable from Arrhenius law with an activation energy, the entropy barrier mechanism is more suitable and could explain the pronounced sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to thermal damage. Accordingly, we predict the efficacy of mild fever over a period of about 24 hours in inactivating the virus.","Seifer, Shahar; Elbaum, Michael",Biophys. j,716,6

METHODS: We established a golden Syrian hamster model co-infected by SARS-CoV-2 and mouse-adapted A(H1N1)pdm09 simultaneously or sequentially. The weight loss, clinical scores, histopathological changes, viral load and titer, and serum neutralizing antibody titre were compared with hamsters challenged by either virus. RESULTS: Co-infected hamsters had more weight loss, more severe lung inflammatory damage and tissue cytokine/chemokine expression. Lung viral load, infectious virus titers and virus antigen expression suggested that hamsters were generally more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than A(H1N1)pdm09. Sequential co-infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 one day prior to SARS-CoV-2 exposure resulted in a lower lung SARS-CoV-2 titer and viral load than with SARS-CoV-2 infection alone, but a higher lung A(H1N1)pdm09 viral load. Co-infection also increased intestinal inflammation with more SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein expression in enterocytes. Simultaneous co-infection was associated with delay in resolution of lung damages, lower serum SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody and longer SARS-CoV-2 shedding in oral swabs compared to that of SARS-CoV-2 infection alone. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous or sequential co-infection by SARS-CoV-2 and A(H1N1)pdm09 caused more severe disease than infection by either virus in hamsters. Prior A(H1N1)pdm09 infection lowered SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary viral loads but enhanced lung damage.

RESULTS: Twenty-six studies were included (22 studies and 5271 patients for AST, 20 studies and 5440 subjects for ALT, and 9 studies and 3542 patients for bilirubin). The outcomes of the studies were: survival (n=8), intensive care unit admission (n=4), and non-fatal severe complications (n=16). AST>ULN (OR 3.10 (95%CI 2.61-3.68)), ALT>ULN (OR 2.15 (95%CI 1.43-3.23)), and bilirubin >ULN (OR 2.78 (95%CI 1.88-4.13)) were associated with an increased prevalence of severe complications, with 78%, 77% and 94% of specificity, respectively. The mean difference between mild and severe COVID-19 was 10.7 U/L (95%CI 5.8-15.6) for AST, 8 U/L (95%CI 1.0-15) for ALT, and 0.3 mg/dL (95%CI 0.16-0.45) for bilirubin. CONCLUSIONS: Patients showing liver injury had significantly higher risks of developing severe COVID-19 compared to those with normal liver function tests at admission. We should include the assessment of AST, ALT, and total bilirubin routinely in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 in order to anticipate those at risk of developing COVID-19-related outcomes.","Ampuero, Javier; Sánchez-Torrijos, Yolanda; García Lozano, María Del Rosario; Maya, Douglas; Romero-Gómez, Manuel",Rev. esp. enferm. dig,716,23

However, studies evaluating how patients using dental prostheses have been affected by the pandemic are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate how patients using different types of dental prostheses were being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 129 randomly selected individuals from among those who had been examined in the same clinic before the COVID-19 outbreak were included in the study. The study participants were divided into 4 groups according to their type of prosthesis: complete dentures, implant-retained removable dentures, tooth-supported fixed partial dentures, and implant-supported fixed partial dentures. The Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) questionnaire was implemented by telephone interviews with the study participants, who were also asked about their concerns and steps made regarding prosthetic hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were evaluated by the Kruskal-Wallis and post hoc Dunn tests, and multivariate logistic regression analysis with forward selection was carried out to identify predictors of the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) status (&#945;=.05). RESULTS: OHIP-14 total scores did not vary significantly among the groups (P>.05). When the domain scores of OHIP-14 were considered separately, the analysis revealed that the implant-retained removable denture group had significantly poorer functional limitations when compared with the tooth-supported fixed partial denture (P=.005) and implant-supported fixed partial denture (P=.031) groups. The results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated a statistically significant association between OHRQoL during the COVID-19 pandemic and the frequency of tooth or denture cleaning (1 time a day versus less than 1 time a day: P=.011; 2-3 times a day versus less than 1 time a day: P=.032). CONCLUSIONS: All prosthesis users exhibited increased interest in dental hygiene and an increase in the frequency of prosthesis cleaning during the pandemic. Furthermore, the study determined that the frequency of tooth or denture cleaning was associated with significantly improved OHRQoL during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the denture groups, those treated with implant-retained removable dentures had the poorest functional limitation in terms of OHRQoL, which can be linked to postponement of routine maintenance appointments. Therefore, providing all patients with scientifically sound information on prosthetic care during a pandemic would be highly beneficial.","Degirmenci, Kubra; Kalaycioglu, Oya",J Prosthet Dent,716,16

The purpose of this study was to broadly summarize the impact of COVID-19 on radiology trainees and their training programs via data collected during the early pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey was distributed to radiology chief residents in residencies throughout North America with responses collected between March 20th, 2020 and May 15th, 2020, which coincided with the development of initial COVID-19 peaks in North America. A subset of COVID-19 pandemic questions included resident wellness, imaging opinions, residency infrastructure change, and opinions regarding the Core Exam delay. RESULTS: One hundred forty chief residents from 86 institutions responded to COVID-19-related questions. Nearly all responding programs (99%; 85/86) reported institutional positive cases of COVID-19. Most residents (94%; 132/140) thought laboratory testing provided more value than imaging. Fifty-seven percent of respondents (80/140) would use COVID-19-related terminology when encountering chest CT findings supportive of viral pneumonia in symptomatic patients. There was little reported change in the number of residents on call (no change reported in >80% of programs). Fifty-nine percent of residents (83/140) reported increased stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of programs (93%) had fewer residents on service (80/86 responding programs). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 dramatically affected radiology residencies during the early pandemic period. As we enter future phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, careful thought should also be given to rebuilding the radiology resident experience.","Hoegger, Mark J; Shetty, Anup S; Denner, Darcy R; Gould, Jennifer E; Wahl, Richard L; Raptis, Constantine A; Ballard, David H",Curr. probl. diagn. radiol,716,3

One was to examine the psychometric quality of the Sleep Hygiene Index (SHI) in Chinese version and its predicted function for the prevalence of insomnia. The other was to describe the prevalence of poor sleep hygiene habits and associated factors of sleep hygiene habits in Chinese nursing students. METHOD: According to Brislin translation model, the English version of SHI was translated into Chinese. And a pilot-survey was carried out to measure psychometric quality of the Chinese version of SHI with 260 nursing students by convenient sampling. Then a cross-sectional survey was conducted. 659 undergraduates were recruited by simple random sampling in a medical university in China. Data collection instruments consisted of a demographic questionnaire, the Sleep Hygiene Index (SHI), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Brief Insomnia Questionnaire (BIQ). Data were analyzed by SPSS 24.0 and Amos 24.0 with P = 0.05 as the significant test value. RESULTS: The internal consistency reliability of SHI in Chinese version was more than 0.60 (&#945; = 0.62, &#969; = 0.63). The concurrent validity presented significantly (r = 0.25, P < 0.001). Exploratory factor analysis found that a six component model explained 63.06% of total variance and confirmatory factor analysis showed good fitness (&#967;2/df=2.14, RMSEA = 0.04). ROC analysis showed that the cut-off value predicting for insomnia was 5.50 (52.90% sensitivity and 75.80% specificity). The area under the ROC curve was 0.66 (95% confidence interval = 0.61-0.71). 199 (30.20%) participant had poor sleep hygiene habits, especially in the aspects of staying too longer in bed (65.25%) and irregular sleep schedule. Multiple linear regression analysis showed health condition, academic difficulties and gender were more common associated factors of sleep hygiene. CONCLUSIONS: The Chinese version of the Sleep Hygiene Index demonstrates satisfactory psychometric qualities and has higher sensitivity and specificity to predict for insomnia. So SHI could be used in Chinese nursing students and detect high levels of insomnia. The status of sleep hygiene of nursing students in China should be concerned. Sleep hygiene education should be carried out in nursing students with different gender, health condition, and academic performance.","Tang, Zhengyan; Li, Xiaomei; Zhang, Yongai; Li, Xiaohong; Zhang, Xiaona; Hu, Minhua; Wang, Jing",Sleep Med,716,16

The aim of this study was to evaluate the activity of our trauma center, relative to shoulder and elbow, in the 30 days starting from March 8, 2020, the first day of restrictions in Italy, and to compare it with the same days of 2019 to weigh the impact of COVID-19 on shoulder and elbow trauma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients managed in our trauma center between March 8, 2020, and April 8, 2020 (COVID period), for shoulder and elbow trauma were retrospectively included and compared to patients admitted in the same period of 2019 (no-COVID period). Clinical records of all participants were examined to obtain information regarding age, sex, mechanism of injury, and diagnosis. RESULTS: During the no-COVID period, 133 patients were admitted for a shoulder or elbow trauma; in the COVID period, there were 47 patients (65% less first aid). In the no-COVID and COVID period, patients with shoulder contusion totaled 60 (14.78% of all; male [M]: 34; female [F]: 26; mean age 51.8 years, range 18-88) and 11 (12.09% of all contusions; M: 7, F: 4; mean age 43 years, range 24-60), respectively. In the no-COVID period, 27 fractures (9.34% of all fractures) involved the shoulder, whereas 18 fractures (8.69%) were registered in the COVID period. In the no-COVID period, 14 elbow fractures were treated (4.8% of all fractures), compared with 4 in the COVID period. In the no-COVID and COVID periods, 6 patients (M: 5, F: 1; mean age 42 years, range 21-64) and 2 patients (M: 1, F: 1; mean age 29.5 years, range 24-35) reported having a feeling of momentary post-traumatic shoulder instability, and 0 and 1 patients (M: 1, F: 0; age 56 years), respectively, reported similar symptoms at the elbow. Finally, first or recurrent dislocations in the no-COVID period were 10, and in the COVID period, 7; elbow dislocations in the no-COVID period were 2, and in the COVID period, there were 3. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID period, we provided a reduced number of health services, especially for patients with low-energy trauma and for those who underwent sports and traffic accidents. However, during the COVID period, elderly subjects remain exposed to shoulder and elbow trauma due to low-energy (domestic) falls. The subsequent hospitalization of these patients has contributed to making it more difficult to manage the hospital wards that are partly occupied by COVID-19 patients.","Gumina, Stefano; Proietti, Riccardo; Polizzotti, Giuseppe; Carbone, Stefano; Candela, Vittorio",J Shoulder Elbow Surg,716,3

The present study attempted to explore the management of catheter ablation in arrhythmia patients during the pandemic. METHODS AND RESULTS: From 1 January 2020 to 24 March 2020, a total of 269 arrhythmia patients hospitalized for catheter ablation under strict risk assessments and careful infection prevention were retrospectively analysed and considered for our analysis at our centre. Preventive measured included a 14 day quarantine, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid detection, adoption of personal protection equipment, application of hand disinfectant, management of hospital visitors, and maintenance of environmental hygiene. Three patients who had fever following ablation and were finally excluded from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and no hospital infection occurred during the 3.1 ± 1.5 day hospitalization period. Additionally, 258/269 (95.9%) patients were free from arrhythmia after a median 133 day follow-up (Q1, 81; Q3, 143; ending 1 June 2020), and no SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: By adopting strict risk assessments and careful infection prevention measures, catheter ablation in patients with arrhythmia can be safely and effectively performed during the COVID-19 epidemic in well-controlled areas.","Li, Kaige; Qin, Mu; Jiang, Weifeng; Zhang, Yu; Wu, Shaohui; Xu, Kai; Liu, Xu",ESC Heart Fail,716,4

First, we discuss the centrality of welfare chauvinism to the PRR's impact on health, taking this as a cue for a broader reflection on the importance on distinguishing between the nativist and populist dimensions of PRR politics. Secondly, we turn our attention to the potential moderating effect of the PRR's welfare chauvinism on the welfare cuts proposed by their right-wing coalition partners, comments we see as pointing to the need to focus on nativist, populist, neoliberal and other threats to welfare policy more generally, rather than on the PRR only. Thirdly, we reflect on the paradoxical nature of welfare chauvinism - its negative consequences for the health of the 'own people' it proclaims to defend - as a starting point for a brief discussion of the need to consider carefully the not-so-straightforward relation between the PRR's political rhetoric, its (impact on) policy and institutions, and the outcomes of such policy.","De Cleen, Benjamin; Speed, Ewen",Int. j. health policy manag,716,1

However, there is currently no data regarding the safety of this drug in patients with kidney impairment. The aim of this paper, therefore, is to share our experience of the use of favipiravir in pediatric patients affected by COVID-19 with any degree of kidney impairment. METHODS: The study enrolled pediatric patients aged under 18 years and confirmed as suffering from COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with any degree of kidney injury, who were treated with favipiravir at the time of admission. RESULTS: Out of a total of 11 patients, 7 were diagnosed with MIS-C and 4 with severe COVID-19. The median age of the cases was 15.45 (9-17.8) years and the male/female ratio was 7/4. At the time of admission, the median serum creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dl. Nine patients were treated with favipiravir for 5 days, and 2 patients for 5 days followed by remdesivir for 5-10 days despite kidney injury at the time of admission. Seven patients underwent plasma exchange for MIS-C while 2 severely affected cases underwent continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT) as well. One severe COVID-19 patient received plasma exchange as well as CKRT. Serum creatinine values returned to normal in mean 3.07 days.

Antibody levels have been shown to gradually decrease in the first months after infection, but few data are available at six months or later. METHODS: A retrospective multi-center study was performed using 652 samples of 236 PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from 2 Belgian University hospitals. Patients were included if at least two samples were available (range 2-7 samples); including at least one sample collected 30 days or later after first positive PCR (range 0-240 days). Of those 236 patients, 19.1 % were classified as mild/asymptomatic (mild) and 80.9 % as moderate to critical (severe). IgG anti-nucleocapsid antibodies (anti-N) were measured using the Abbott Architect immunoassay. RESULTS: 22.2 % of mild and 2.6 % of severe COVID-19 cases never seroconverted (p < 0.001). Of the mild patients who seroconverted 0-59 days after PCR; 18.8 %, 40.0 % and 61.1 % were seronegative in the windows 60-119 days, 120-179 days and 180-240 days after PCR, respectively.

DESIGN: Randomized group design preceded by controlled observation and iterative product redesigns. SETTING: The Cognitive Ergonomics Lab in the School of Psychology at the Georgia Institute of Technology. PARTICIPANTS: We included participants who were unfamiliar with the WHO hand-rub diagram (convenience sampling) to ensure that performance was based on the diagram and not, for example, on prior experience. METHODS: We iterated through the steps of a human factors design procedure: (1) Participants simulated hand hygiene using ultraviolet (UV) absorbent lotion and a hand-rub technique diagram (ie, WHO or a redesign). (2) Coverage, confusion judgments, and behavioral videos informed potentially improved diagrams. And (3) the redesigned diagrams were compared with the WHO version in a randomized group design. Coverage was assessed across 72 hand areas from multiple UV photographs. RESULTS: The WHO diagram led to multiple omissions in hand-surface coverage, including inadequate coverage by up to 75% of participants for the ulnar edge. The redesigns improved coverage significantly overall and often substantially. CONCLUSIONS: Human factors modification to the WHO diagram reduced inadequate coverage for naïve users.

METHOD: The sample consisted of 2554 hospital workers (i.e., physicians, nurses, allied health professionals, and auxiliary staff members) who were working in Yeungnam University Hospital in Daegu, South Korea. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) was administered to the hospital workers twice over a 2 week interval. A high-risk group, identified on the basic of first total IES-R, was assessed further with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGIS) scale and was offered periodic psychiatric consultations on a telephone. RESULTS: The participating nurses and auxiliary staff members had significantly higher IES-R scores (p < 0.01) than the physicians. During the second evaluation, the IES-R scores of the high-risk participants had decreased by 13.67 ± 16.15 points (p < 0.01), and their CGI-S scores had decreased by 1.00 ± 0.74 points (p < 0.01). The psychological symptoms of the high-risk group who received telephone-based psychiatric consultation showed improvement after 2 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that hospital workers experience high levels of emotional stress during a pandemic. In particular, the present findings underscore the need to provide more information and support to nurses and other administrative workers. There is a need for greater awareness about the importance of mental health care among hospital workers, and rapid and ongoing psychiatric interventions should be provided to workers during the pandemic period.","Jo, So-Hye; Koo, Bon-Hoon; Seo, Wan-Seok; Yun, Seok-Ho; Kim, Hye-Geum",Compr Psychiatry,716,16

This study aimed to investigate the impact of pandemic-associated stress on food parenting practices including interactions surrounding snacks, and child diet. METHODS: Parents (N = 318) of 2-12-year old children completed a cross-sectional online survey assessing current COVID-19-specific stress, pre-COVID-19 stress, financial stress (e.g. food insecurity), food parenting practices, and child snack intake frequency. Structural Equation Modeling was used to model simultaneous paths of relationships and test direct and indirect effects. RESULTS: Stress, including financial hardship, was higher compared with before the crisis. The majority of children had regular mealtimes and irregular snack times. Higher COVID-19-specific stress was associated with more non-nutritive use of food and snacks (e.g. emotional and instrumental feeding), but also more structure and positive interactions (e.g. eating with or engaging with child around mealtimes). Higher COVID-19-specific stress was also associated with greater child intake frequency of sweet and savory snacks, with some evidence for mediation by snack parenting practices.

Responding to the argument that COVID-19-driven changes may not be sustainable, this essay offers a counter narrative from the Korean context, in which educators re-visited existing school systems and re-constructed policies and teaching practices to fill the educational vacuum caused by the pandemic. This essay specifically builds on interviews conducted with Korean educators throughout the 2020 school year during COVID-19. First, we discuss ownership of educational change as reflected in educators’ narratives. We then explore three driving forces behind the transformation of the “grammar of Korean schooling”: policy discourse about “future education,” professional teaching culture, and administration for creativity. Based on our analysis, we offer several suggestions for policymakers, district leaders, and educators around the world for how to leverage and sustain the educational changes catalyzed by COVID-19. We conclude by arguing that educators’ desires to achieve change must be actualized in schools and policies through collaborative foresight and system-level support.","Kim, Taeyeon Yang Minseok Lim Sunbin",Journal of Educational Change,716,1

METHODS: Using qualitative research methods, semistructured interviews were conducted with 12 emergency nurses who met the inclusion criteria, and Colaizzi analysis was used for data analysis, summary, and induction. RESULTS: A cluster of 4 themes that involved preparedness of the emergency department during the COVID-19 outbreak was extracted: organizational preparedness, personal preparedness, patient and family preparedness, and deficiencies and challenges. DISCUSSION: Organizations, individuals, patients, and family members were actively prepared to respond to novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak in the emergency department. The emergency nurses said that the trusted organization guaranteed personal preparedness, and the active cooperation from patients and families was a motivator for personal preparedness. In addition, our study showed that there were deficiencies in both multidisciplinary collaboration efforts and efforts to rapidly diagnose and treat patients with fever in critical condition.","Hou, Yongchao; Zhou, Qian; Li, Dongzhi; Guo, Yanhua; Fan, Jingjing; Wang, Juzi",J Emerg Nurs,716,20

Although it has been suggested that these drugs might lead to a higher susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 infection, experimental data suggest these agents may reduce acute lung injury via blocking angiotensin-II-mediated pulmonary permeability, inflammation and fibrosis. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to answer the question: What is the effect of medications that influence ACE2 expression (ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and thiazolidinediones) on the outcomes of COVID-19? Relevant outcome measures were mortality (crucial), hospital admission, length of stay, thromboembolic complications (pulmonary embolism, stroke, transient ischaemic attack), need for mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury and use of renal replacement therapy. Medline and Embase databases were searched with relevant search terms until 24 June 2020. After systematic analysis, nine studies were included. RESULTS: The results were described for two different groups, an overall group in which all users were compared with non-users and a group in which only hypertensive patients were included. Within each group a distinction was made between results for ACEI/ARB use, ACEI use, ARB use, NSAID use and thiazolidinedione use. None of the studies demonstrated increased mortality in the two groups. Furthermore, none of the studies showed an effect on other outcome measures in COVID-19, such as ICU admission, length of hospital stay, thromboembolic complications, need for mechanical ventilation, acute kidney failure or need for renal replacement therapy. However, the level of evidence of all studies varied from 'moderate' to 'very low', according to the GRADE methodology. CONCLUSION: Analysis of the literature demonstrated that there was insufficient evidence to answer our objective on the effect of ACE2 expression mediating pharmacotherapy on outcome in COVID-19 patients, especially due to the low scientific quality of the described studies. Randomised controlled studies are needed to answer this question.","van Kimmenade, R R J; Belfroid, E; Hoogervorst-Schilp, J; Siebelink, H J; Janssen, C W; Pinto, Y",Neth Heart J,716,20

METHODS: The extent of PAS involvement in the eyes of patients with angle closure was assessed by indentation gonioscopy, and the part of non-PAS and PAS were assigned into two groups (NPAS and PAS). Anterior chamber angles were then imaged by AS-OCT with light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation directly into the pupils, leading to pupillary constriction and increasing anterior chamber angle width. Parameters including the angle opening distance at 750 µm anterior to the scleral spur (AOD750) and trabecular-iris space area at 750 µm anterior to the scleral spur (TISA750) were then obtained. The differences before and after LED irradiation of AOD750 and TISA750 were calculated and used to generate a PAS model based on binary logistic regression. Validation data were then tested. RESULTS: A total of 258 AS-OCT images in 14 eyes were assigned to the modeling data, and 120 were assigned to the validation data. There were no differences in AOD750 and TISA750 in the dark between NPAS and PAS (PAOD750 = 0.258, PTISA750 = 0.486), whereas after LED light exposure, TISA750light was larger in NPAS than in PAS (P = 0.047). The light-dark differences of both parameters showed significant differences between the two groups (PAOD750dif = 0.019, PTISA750dif < 0.001). The area under the curve of the model performance was 0.841, and the overall correct rate was 80.8% based on the validation data. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that the AS-OCT-based PAS model could be useful in the identifying of the presence of synechial angle closure and evaluating the extent of PAS in a single eye.","Dai, Yingying; Zhang, Shaodan; Shen, Meixiao; Jin, Zi; Zhou, Yuheng; Ye, Shuling; Bao, Chenhong; Zhu, Dexi",Graefes arch. clin. exp. ophthalmol,716,16

To develop a deeper understanding of the contribution of PM2.5 in the propagation of the SAR-CoV-2 virus in the population, the deposition patterns and efficiencies (DEs) of PM2.5 laced with the virus in healthy and asthmatic airways are studied. Physiologically correct 3-D models for generations 10-12 of the human airways are applied to carry out a numerical analysis of two-phase flow for full breathing cycles. Two concentrations of PM2.5 are applied for the simulation, i.e., 30 µgâ m-3 and 80 µgâ m-3 for three breathing statuses, i.e., rest, light exercise, and moderate activity. All the PM2.5 injected into the control volume is assumed to be 100% contaminated with the SAR-CoV-2 virus. Skewed air-flow phenomena at the bifurcations are proportional to the Reynolds number at the inlet, and their intensity in the asthmatic airway exceeded that of the healthy one. Upon exhalation, two peak air-flow vectors from daughter branches combine to form one big vector in the parent generation. Asthmatic airway models has higher deposition efficiencies (DEs) for contaminated PM2.5 as compared to the healthy one. Higher DEs arise in the asthmatic airway model due to complex secondary flows which increase the impaction of contaminated PM2.5 on airways' walls.","Chen, Wei-Hsin; Mutuku, Justus Kavita; Yang, Zhe-Wei; Hwang, Chii-Jong; Lee, Wen Jhy; Ashokkumar, Veeramuthu",Environ Res,716,16

METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR-positive patients aged 18-85 years with asymptomatic to mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms for <8 days were recruited. A total of 176 eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to CDCM or placebo. Three rinses daily were performed for 7 days. Saliva sampling was performed on day 1 at 09.00 (T1), 13.00 (T2) and 18.00 (T3). On the following 6 days, one sample was taken at 15.00. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The intention-to-treat analysis demonstrated that, over the course of 1 day, CDCM was significantly more effective than placebo 4 hours after the first dose (p 0.036), with a median percentage (log10 copies/mL) decrease T1-T2 of -12.58% (IQR -29.55% to -0.16%). The second dose maintained the low median value for the CDCM (3.08 log10 copies/mL; IQR 0-4.19), compared with placebo (3.31 log10 copies/mL; IQR 1.18-4.75). At day 7, there was still a greater median percentage (log10 copies/mL) decrease in salivary viral load over time in the CDCM group (-58.62%; IQR -100% to -34.36%) compared with the placebo group (-50.62%; IQR -100% to -27.66%). These results were confirmed by the per-protocol analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This trial supports the relevance of using CDCM on day 1 (4 hours after the initial dose) to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in saliva. For long-term effect (7 days), CDMC appears to provide a modest benefit compared with placebo in reducing viral load in saliva.","Carrouel, Florence; Valette, Martine; Gadea, Emilie; Esparcieux, Aurélie; Illes, Gabriela; Langlois, Marie Elodie; Perrier, Hervé; Dussart, Claude; Tramini, Paul; Ribaud, Mélina; Bouscambert-Duchamp, Maude; Bourgeois, Denis",Clin. microbiol. infect,716,20

Design/methodology/approach The authors followed a quantitative approach and conducted a questionnaire survey of 320 Turkish yacht captains. The data were analyzed using SPSS 22 (Process macro v3.4) and AMOS 22 statistics package programs. Findings Perceived SS has direct and indirect effects on TI with WFC being the intermediate variable. WFC's effect on TI varies according to the yacht captains' levels of PR. Practical implications This study empirically uncovered the impact of supervisor support and PR levels, the most important factors for ensuring hospitality employees exhibit positive organizational attitudes and behaviors. This study shows that the success of yacht captains in this stressful work environment depends on positively perceived SS and PR levels. PR regulates the relationship between WFC and TIs. Thus, supervisors should prioritize meeting their employees' expectations to effectively and efficiently manage their human resources, and supervisor support is essential for meeting these expectations. Originality/value According to the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to assess the effect of supervisor support on TI, the mediating role of WFC and the moderating role of PR.

However, even if most physical distancing measures are continued, other public health measures will be needed to control the epidemic. Contact tracing via conventional methods or mobile app technology is central to control strategies during de-escalation of physical distancing. We aimed to identify key factors for a contact tracing strategy to be successful. METHODS: We evaluated the impact of timeliness and completeness in various steps of a contact tracing strategy using a stochastic mathematical model with explicit time delays between time of infection and symptom onset, and between symptom onset, diagnosis by testing, and isolation (testing delay). The model also includes tracing of close contacts (eg, household members) and casual contacts, followed by testing regardless of symptoms and isolation if testing positive, with different tracing delays and coverages. We computed effective reproduction numbers of a contact tracing strategy (RCTS) for a population with physical distancing measures and various scenarios for isolation of index cases and tracing and quarantine of their contacts. FINDINGS: For the most optimistic scenario (testing and tracing delays of 0 days and tracing coverage of 100%), and assuming that around 40% of transmissions occur before symptom onset, the model predicts that the estimated effective reproduction number of 1·2 (with physical distancing only) will be reduced to 0·8 (95% CI 0·7-0·9) by adding contact tracing. The model also shows that a similar reduction can be achieved when testing and tracing coverage is reduced to 80% (RCTS 0·8, 95% CI 0·7-1·0). A testing delay of more than 1 day requires the tracing delay to be at most 1 day or tracing coverage to be at least 80% to keep RCTS below 1. With a testing delay of 3 days or longer, even the most efficient strategy cannot reach RCTS values below 1. The effect of minimising tracing delay (eg, with app-based technology) declines with decreasing coverage of app use, but app-based tracing alone remains more effective than conventional tracing alone even with 20% coverage, reducing the reproduction number by 17·6% compared with 2·5%. The proportion of onward transmissions per index case that can be prevented depends on testing and tracing delays, and given a 0-day tracing delay, ranges from up to 79·9% with a 0-day testing delay to 41·8% with a 3-day testing delay and 4·9% with a 7-day testing delay. INTERPRETATION: In our model, minimising testing delay had the largest impact on reducing onward transmissions. Optimising testing and tracing coverage and minimising tracing delays, for instance with app-based technology, further enhanced contact tracing effectiveness, with the potential to prevent up to 80% of all transmissions. Access to testing should therefore be optimised, and mobile app technology might reduce delays in the contact tracing process and optimise contact tracing coverage.

We take a step toward establishing guidelines for designing such overlays by studying the relationship between three different patterns (filled, striped and dotted patterns), two pattern densities, the presence or not of a solid outline, two types of background (blank and with trees), and the opacity of the overlay. For each combination of factors, participants set the faintest and the strongest acceptable opacity values.

DESIGN: Community-based retrospective cohort. SETTING: Primary Health Care Tarragona region. PARTICIPANTS: 282 community-dwelling symptomatic patients &#8805;50 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (hospitalised and/or outpatient) during March-June 2020 in Tarragona (Southern Catalonia, Spain). MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Relationship between demographics, pre-existing comorbidities and early symptomatology (first 5-days) and risk of suffering critical outcome (ICU-admission/death) across clinical course was evaluated by logistic regression analyses, and simple predictive models were developed. RESULTS: Of the 282 cases (mean age: 65.9 years; 140 men), 154 (54.6%) were hospitalised (30 ICU-admitted) and 45 (16%) deceased. Median time follow-up in clinical course was 31 days (range: 30-150) for survivors and 14 days (range: 1-81) for deceased patients. In crude analyses, increasing age, male sex, some comorbidities (renal, respiratory or cardiac disease, diabetes and hypertension) and symptoms (confusion, dyspnoea) were associated with an increased risk to suffer critical outcome, whereas other symptoms (rinorrhea, myalgias, headache, anosmia/disgeusia) were related with reduced risk. After multivariable-adjustment only age/years (OR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.01-1.07; p=0.004), confusion (OR: 5.33; 95% CI: 1.54-18.48; p=0.008), dyspnoea (OR: 5.41; 95% CI: 2.74-10.69; p<0.001) and myalgias (OR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.10-0.93; p=0.038) remained significantly associated with increased or reduced risk. A proposed CD65-M prognostic rule (acronym of above mentioned 4 variables) showed a good correlation with the risk of suffering critical outcome (area under ROC curve: 0.828; 95% CI: 0.774-0.882). CONCLUSION: Clinical course of COVID-19 is early unpredictable, but simple clinical tools as the proposed CD65-M rule (pending external validation) may be helpful assessing these patients in primary care settings.","Vila-Corcoles, Angel; Satue-Gracia, Eva; Vila-Rovira, Angel; de Diego-Cabanes, Cinta; Forcadell-Peris, Maria Jose; Ochoa-Gondar, Olga",Aten Primaria,716,5

Many cases of COVID-19 are nosocomial, but to the best of our knowledge, no nosocomial outbreaks on psychiatric departments of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported in Europe. The different nature of psychiatry makes outbreak management more difficult. This study determines which psychiatry specific factors contributed to a nosocomial outbreak taking place in a psychiatric department. This will provide possible interventions in future outbreak management. METHOD: A case series describing a nosocomial outbreak in a psychiatric department of an acute care hospital in the Netherlands between March 13, 2020 and April, 14 2020. The outbreak was analyzed by combining data from standardized interviews, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and whole genome sequencing (WGS). RESULTS: The nosocomial outbreak in which 43% of staff of the psychiatric department and 19% of admitted patients were involved, was caused by healthcare worker (HCW)-to-HCW transmissions, as well as patient-to-HCW-to-patient transmission. We identified four aspects associated with the mental health care system which might have made our department more susceptible to an outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Infection control measures designed for hospitals are not directly applicable to psychiatric departments. Psychiatric patients should be considered a high-risk group for infectious diseases and customized measures should be designed and implemented. Extra attention for psychiatric departments is necessary during a pandemic as psychiatric HCWs are less familiar with outbreak management. Clear communication and governance is crucial in correctly implementing these measures.","Rovers, J J E; van de Linde, L S; Kenters, N; Bisseling, E M; Nieuwenhuijse, D F; Oude Munnink, B B; Voss, A; Nabuurs-Franssen, M",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,716,6

Given that patients with cancer are generally more vulnerable to infections, systematic analysis of diverse cohorts of patients with cancer affected by COVID-19 is needed. We performed a multicenter study including 105 patients with cancer and 536 age-matched noncancer patients confirmed with COVID-19. Our results showed COVID-19 patients with cancer had higher risks in all severe outcomes. Patients with hematologic cancer, lung cancer, or with metastatic cancer (stage IV) had the highest frequency of severe events. Patients with nonmetastatic cancer experienced similar frequencies of severe conditions to those observed in patients without cancer. Patients who received surgery had higher risks of having severe events, whereas patients who underwent only radiotherapy did not demonstrate significant differences in severe events when compared with patients without cancer. These findings indicate that patients with cancer appear more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.

This was also prevalent among participants who described themselves as religious. One-fourth of participants reported experiencing increased meaning in life, while another fourth reported experiencing a crisis of meaning. Especially young participants reported increased meaningfulness, but also higher crisis of meaning. Reporting a crisis of meaning was moderately associated with poorer mental health, as well as fear of contamination and lower education and income.

As such, we proposed an online course where this method was applied in order to improve the quality of life of health care professionals in COVID 19 pandemic times. We also carried out an evaluation of the satisfaction level of the participants involved, with a view to establishing strategies to improve future experiences. To automatically perform this task, we used Natural Language Processing (NLP) models such as swivel embedding, neural networks, and transfer learning, so as to classify the inputs into the following three categories: negative, neutral, and positive. Due to the limited amount of data available-86 registers for the first and 68 for the second-transfer learning techniques were required. The length of the text had no limit from the user's standpoint, and our approach attained a maximum accuracy of 93.02% and 90.53%, respectively, based on ground truth labeled by three experts. Finally, we proposed a complementary analysis, using computer graphic text representation based on word frequency, to help researchers identify relevant information about the opinions with an objective approach to sentiment.

It has been increasingly used in neurodevelopmental disorders, especially attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but its efficacy (based on effect size calculations), safety, and stimulation parameters have not been systematically examined. In this systematic review, we aimed to (1) explore the effectiveness of tDCS on the clinical symptoms and neuropsychological deficits of ADHD patients, (2) evaluate the safety of tDCS application, especially in children with ADHD, (3) model the electrical field intensity in the target regions based on the commonly-applied and effective versus less-effective protocols, and (4) discuss and propose advanced tDCS parameters. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses approach, a literature search identified 14 empirical experiments investigating tDCS effects in ADHD. Partial improving effects of tDCS on cognitive deficits (response inhibition, working memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility) or clinical symptoms (e.g., impulsivity and inattention) are reported in 10 studies. No serious adverse effects are reported in 747 sessions of tDCS. The left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex are the regions most often targeted, and anodal tDCS the protocol most often applied. An intensity of 2 mA induced stronger electrical fields than 1 mA in adults with ADHD and was associated with significant behavioral changes. In ADHD children, however, the electrical field induced by 1 mA, which is likely larger than the electrical field induced by 1 mA in adults due to the smaller head size of children, was sufficient to result in significant behavioral change. Overall, tDCS seems to be a promising method for improving ADHD deficits. However, the clinical utility of tDCS in ADHD cannot yet be concluded and requires further systematic investigation in larger sample sizes. Cortical regions involved in ADHD pathophysiology, stimulation parameters (e.g. intensity, duration, polarity, and electrode size), and types of symptom/deficit are potential determinants of tDCS efficacy in ADHD. Developmental aspects of tDCS in childhood ADHD should be considered as well.","Salehinejad, Mohammad Ali; Nejati, Vahid; Mosayebi-Samani, Mohsen; Mohammadi, Ali; Wischnewski, Miles; Kuo, Min-Fang; Avenanti, Alessio; Vicario, Carmelo M; Nitsche, Michael A",Neurosci. bull,716,16

Many health care providers and systems rapidly virtualized care to include visits occurring in what previously were defined as nontraditional locations such as provider and patient homes. Emerging data and reports suggest that this rapid virtualization of mental health services occurred safely and effectively. Although it is uncertain how long the full virtualization will remain, we envision a future wherein mental health services are delivered using a hybrid in-person/TMH approach. This opinion provides an overview of current lessons learned from rapid virtualization due to COVID-19 mitigation strategies and recommends that mental health providers and systems use these lessons to define and promote hybrid care delivery.","Mishkind, Matthew C; Shore, Jay H; Schneck, Christopher D",Telemed. j. e. health,716,11

MATERIAL AND METHODS: An approved, observational, retrospective study was conducted between March 15 to April 15, 2020. 150 adult patients aged less than 75 with Charlson comorbidity index &#8804; 6 diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia were included. Seventy-five patients were randomly selected from those admitted to the critical care units (Critical care group (CG)) and seventy-five hospitalized patients who did not require critical care (Non-Critical care group (nCG)) represent the control group. One additional cohort of hospitalized patiens with COVID-19 were used to validate the score. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital critical care associated with increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (odds ratio 1.052 (1.009-1.101); p=0·0043) and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (1.968 (1.389-2.590); p<0·0001), both at the time of hospital admission.

To our knowledge, no study has evaluated the accuracy of COVID-19 symptom checkers in a statistically rigorous manner. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the diagnostic accuracies of web-based COVID-19 symptom checkers. METHODS: We identified 10 web-based COVID-19 symptom checkers, all of which were included in the study. We evaluated the COVID-19 symptom checkers by assessing 50 COVID-19 case reports alongside 410 non-COVID-19 control cases. A bootstrapping method was used to counter the unbalanced sample sizes and obtain confidence intervals (CIs). Results are reported as sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). RESULTS: The classification task between COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative for ""high risk"" cases among the 460 test cases yielded (sorted by F1 score): Symptoma (F1=0.92, MCC=0.85), Infermedica (F1=0.80, MCC=0.61), US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (F1=0.71, MCC=0.30), Babylon (F1=0.70, MCC=0.29), Cleveland Clinic (F1=0.40, MCC=0.07), Providence (F1=0.40, MCC=0.05), Apple (F1=0.29, MCC=-0.10), Docyet (F1=0.27, MCC=0.29), Ada (F1=0.24, MCC=0.27) and Your.MD (F1=0.24, MCC=0.27).

The virus responsible for COVID-19-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-gains entry into host cells via ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). ACE2 is a primary enzyme within the key counter-regulatory pathway of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which acts to oppose the actions of Ang (angiotensin) II by generating Ang-(1-7) to reduce inflammation and fibrosis and mitigate end organ damage. As COVID-19 spans multiple organ systems linked to the cardiovascular system, it is imperative to understand clearly how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may affect the multifaceted RAS. In addition, recognition of the role of ACE2 and the RAS in COVID-19 has renewed interest in its role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease in general. We provide researchers with a framework of best practices in basic and clinical research to interrogate the RAS using appropriate methodology, especially those who are relatively new to the field. This is crucial, as there are many limitations inherent in investigating the RAS in experimental models and in humans. We discuss sound methodological approaches to quantifying enzyme content and activity (ACE, ACE2), peptides (Ang II, Ang-[1-7]), and receptors (types 1 and 2 Ang II receptors, Mas receptor). Our goal is to ensure appropriate research methodology for investigations of the RAS in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and COVID-19 to ensure optimal rigor and reproducibility and appropriate interpretation of results from these investigations.","Sparks, Matthew A; South, Andrew M; Badley, Andrew D; Baker-Smith, Carissa M; Batlle, Daniel; Bozkurt, Biykem; Cattaneo, Roberto; Crowley, Steven D; Dell039,; Italia, Louis J; Ford, Andria L; Griendling, Kathy; Gurley, Susan B; Kasner, Scott E; Murray, Joseph A; Nath, Karl A; Pfeffer, Marc A; Rangaswami, Janani; Taylor, W Robert; Garovic, Vesna D",Hypertension,716,1

In this work, we aimed at testing whether clinical care changes imposed by the quarantine, together with certain demographic and disease-specific features, might have determined a self-perceived worsening of health status in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). METHODS: A brief web-based questionnaire investigating self-perceived anxiety, depression, and motor worsening, as well as clinical care changes over COVID-19 emergency, was administered to ALS patients currently followed at San Martino Hospital. Ordinal and logistic regression analyses were applied to identify significant predictors of health status. RESULTS: Fifty-seven ALS patients completed the questionnaire. A total of 35.08% of cases reported anxiety symptoms, 36.84% depressive symptoms, and 35.08% reported worsening of motor symptoms. Significant predictors of anxiety symptoms severity included female gender, greater motor impairment, more aggressive disease course, and rehabilitation therapy suspension. The only significant predictor of depressive symptoms severity was a more aggressive disease course. Significant predictors of motor worsening were shorter disease duration and exams/visits cancelation. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 emergency and its management exerted a significant impact on self-perceived health status in patients with ALS, particularly in those cases in the earliest disease phases and with a more aggressive disease course. These findings have potential to improve personalized medicine strategies in the next phase.","Cabona, Corrado; Ferraro, Pilar M; Meo, Giuseppe; Roccatagliata, Luca; Schenone, Angelo; Inglese, Matilde; Villani, Flavio; Caponnetto, Claudia",Neurol. sci,716,16

A graphical interface enables users with no bioinformatics expertise to analyse WGS experiments and reconstruct consensus genome sequences from individual isolates of viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. InterARTIC is intended to facilitate widespread adoption and standardisation of ONT sequencing for viral surveillance and molecular epidemiology. Worked example We demonstrate the use of InterARTIC for the analysis of ONT viral WGS data from SARS-CoV-2 and Ebola virus, using a laptop computer or the internal computer on an ONT GridION sequencing device. We showcase the intuitive graphical interface, workflow customisation capabilities and job-scheduling system that facilitate execution of small- and large-scale WGS projects on any common virus. Implementation InterARTIC is a free, open-source web application implemented in Python. The application can be downloaded as a set of pre-compiled binaries that are compatible with all common Ubuntu distributions, or built from source.

This study aimed to assess how different instrument settings affect detectable droplet spread and patterns of aerosolised droplet spread during simulated sinonasal surgery in order to identify mitigation strategies. DESIGN: Simulation series using three‐dimensional (3‐D) printed sinonasal model. Fluorescein droplet spread was assessed following microdebriding and drilling of fluorescein‐soaked grapes and bones, respectively. SETTING: University dry lab. PARTICIPANTS: 3‐D printed sinonasal model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patterns of aerosolised droplet spread. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: There were no observed fluorescein droplets or splatter in the measured surgical field after microdebridement of nasal polyps at aspecific irrigation rate and suction pressure. Activation of the microdebrider in the presence of excess fluid in the nasal cavity (reduced or blocked suction pressure, excessive irrigation fluid or bleeding) resulted in detectable droplet spread. Drilling with either coarse diamond or cutting burs resulted in detectable droplets and greater spread was observed when drilling within the anterior nasal cavity. High‐speed drilling is a high‐risk AGP but the addition of suction using a third hand technique reduces detectable droplet spread outside the nasal cavity. Using the instrument outside the nasal cavity inadvertently, or when unblocking, produces greater droplet spread and requires more caution.","Leong, Samuel C.; Mogre, Dilesh; Andrews, Peter; Davies, Elgan",Clin Otolaryngol,716,16

Since 1985, a series of vaccines composed of the type b capsular polysaccharide polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP), followed by PRP conjugated to various proteins, have been licensed for use in the United States and worldwide. The conjugated vaccines offer increased immunogenicity and prolonged durability of immune protection compared to the plain PRP vaccine and increasingly are combined with other childhood vaccines for decreased cost and increased ease of vaccination. Hib vaccines have a very favorable safety profile, have been found to be either cost-saving or cost-effective by many public health agencies, and, in most countries, are initiated during early infancy as part of routine childhood immunization programs. As a result of widespread use of the vaccines, the incidence of Hib infections, and their associated morbidity and mortality, has fallen dramatically across the globe. Yet, many children remain unimmunized or underimmunized against Hib, particularly in limited-resource countries. Future efforts to further reduce the disease burden of Hib infections remain a high priority.","Gilsdorf, Janet R",J Infect Dis,716,30

Here we quantify the accelerating evolution of SARS-CoV-2 by tracking the SARS-CoV-2 mutation globally, with a focus on the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the spike protein believed to determine infectivity. We estimate that 384 million people were infected by March 1st, 2021, producing up to 1021 copies of the virus, with one new RBD variant appearing for every 600,000 human infections, resulting in approximately three new effective RBD variants produced daily. Doubling the number of RBD variants every 71.67 days followed by selection of the most infective variants challenges our defenses and calls for a shift to anticipatory, rather than reactive tactics. One-Sentence Summary Accelerating evolution of SARS-CoV-2 demands formulating universal vaccines and treatments based on big-data simulations of possible new variants.","Duarte, Carlos M.; Ketcheson, David; Eguíluz, Víctor M.; Agustí, Susana; Fernández-Gracia, Juan; Jamil, Tahira; Laiolo, Elisa; Gojobori, Takashi; Alam, Intikhab",bioRxiv,716,24

It describes how Covid-19 shines a spotlight on the uneven distribution of goods and burdens, opportunities and resources that we find in most of the world's cities today; inequality and justice challenges arise from both the crisis itself and some of the policy reactions to it, such as the stay-at-home orders and economic lockdowns. It shows how exposure and vulnerability to Covid-19 emerges mainly at the intersection between different dimensions of disadvantage and marginalization. The example of housing and green space provision is used to discuss this general argument in more detail. The article concludes that to overcome the social crisis and justice challenge posed by Covid-19, we have to tackle the underlying structures/mechanisms leading to inequitable outcomes in today's cities, and to re-think the social and justice yardsticks of current urban sustainability and resilience debates and strategies.","Haase, Annegret",Front Sociol,716,16
