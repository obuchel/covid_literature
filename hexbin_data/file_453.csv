4728,Innovationen in der Leberchirurgie durch die Transplantation mit Lebendspende,2003,"Recently, bats have gained attention as potential reservoir hosts for emerging zoonotic single-stranded (ssRNA) viruses that may prove fatal for humans and other mammals. It has been hypothesized that some features of their innate immune system may enable bats to trigger an efficient early immune response. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) represent a first line defense within the innate immune system and lie directly at the host–pathogen interface in targeting specific microbe-molecular patterns. However, the direction and strength of selection acting on TLRs are largely unknown for bats. Here, we studied the selection on viral ssRNA sensing TLR8 based on sequence data of 21 bat species. The major part (63 %) of the TLR8 gene evolved under purifying selection, likely due to functional constraints. We also found evidence for persistent positive selection acting on specific amino acid sites (7 %), especially when compared to viral TLR evolution of other mammals. All of these putatively positively selected codons were located in the ligand-binding ectodomain, some coincidenced or were in close proximity to functional sites, as suggested by the crystallographic structure of the human TLR8. This might contribute to the inter-species variation in the ability to recognize molecular patterns of viruses. TLR8 evolution within bats revealed that branches leading to ancestral and recent lineages evolved under episodic positive selection, indicating selective selection pressures in restricted bat lineages. Altogether, we found that the TLR8 displays extensive sequence variation within bats and that unique features separate them from humans and other mammals.

This article explains why the prognosis of cancer patients in the intensive care unit has markedly improved over the last decades, what the reasons for admission are and which risk factors affect mortality. Furthermore, the importance of correct patient selection and other specific topics will be discussed. Accordingly, acute respiratory failure for example is the most common organ dysfunction in these patients and has specific prognostic, diagnostic and therapeutic characteristics. The successful management of cancer patients in the intensive care unit requires specific knowledge of the intensive care physician and an excellent cooperation with the treating hematologist and oncologist.","Schellongowski, P.; Staudinger, T.",Med Klin Intensivmed Notfmed,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095938/,453

Jahrestagung der Österreichischen Gesellschaft für Kinder- und Jugendheilkunde,2011-10-23,"Transplantation medicine is an interdisciplinary task and the priority objective is a fast recovery to patient independence. After kidney transplantation the crucial aims are monitoring of transplant perfusion, maintainance of an adequate volume status and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications. Transplantation for patients with advanced chronic liver failure has become more common since the implementation of the model of end stage liver disease (MELD) allocation system which is associated with more complicated proceedings. The essentials of critical care after liver transplantation are monitoring of transplant function, diagnosis of perfusion or biliary tract problems, specific substitution of coagulation factors and hemodynamic optimation due to avoidance of hepatic congestion. Many patients listed for heart transplantation need preoperative intensive care due to impaired heart function. Postoperatively a specific cardiac support with pulmonary arterial dilatators and inotropics is usually necessary. Lung transplantation aims at an improvement of patient quality of life. Postoperative critical care should provide a limitation of the pulmonary arterial pressure, avoidance of volume overload and rapid weaning from the respirator.","Lichtenstern, C.; Müller, M.; Schmidt, J.; Mayer, K.; Weigand, M.A.",Anaesthesist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096098/,453

9635,Mitteilungen der DGU,2020-04-15,"Wild migratory birds are often implicated in the introduction, maintenance, and global dissemination of different pathogens, such as influenza A viruses (IAV) and antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria. Trapping of migratory birds during their resting periods at the northern coast of Egypt is a common and ancient practice performed mainly for selling in live bird markets (LBM). In the present study, samples were collected from 148 wild birds, representing 14 species, which were being offered for sale in LBM. All birds were tested for the presence of AIV and enterobacteriaceae. Ten samples collected from Northern Shoveler birds (Spatula clypeata) were positive for IAV and PCR sub-typing and pan HA/NA sequencing assays detected H5N8, H9N2, and H6N2 viruses in four, four, and one birds, respectively. Sequencing of the full haemagglutinin (HA) gene revealed a high similarity with currently circulating IAV in Egypt. From all the birds, E. coli was recovered from 37.2% and Salmonella from 20.2%, with 66–96% and 23–43% isolates being resistant to at least one of seven selected critically important antimicrobials (CIA), respectively. The presence of enzootic IAV and the wide prevalence of AMR enterobacteriaceae in wild birds highlight the potential role of LBM in the spread of different pathogens from and to wild birds. Continued surveillance of both AIV and antimicrobial-resistant enterobacteriaceae in wild birds’ habitats is urgently needed.","Nabil, Nehal M.; Erfan, Ahmed M.; Tawakol, Maram M.; Haggag, Naglaa M.; Naguib, Mahmoud M.; Samy, Ahmed",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7157678/,453
10480,Nachfrageorientierte Klimapolitik — Evidenz aus der Corona-Krise,2020-04-22,"Nanotechnologies are considered to be of growing importance to the vaccine field. Through decoration of immunogens on multivalent nanoparticles, designed nanovaccines can elicit improved humoral immunity. However, significant practical and monetary challenges in large‐scale production of nanovaccines have impeded their widespread clinical translation. Here, an alternative approach is illustrated integrating computational protein modeling and adaptive electroporation‐mediated synthetic DNA delivery, thus enabling direct in vivo production of nanovaccines. DNA‐launched nanoparticles are demonstrated displaying an HIV immunogen spontaneously self‐assembled in vivo. DNA‐launched nanovaccines induce stronger humoral responses than their monomeric counterparts in both mice and guinea pigs, and uniquely elicit CD8+ effector T‐cell immunity as compared to recombinant protein nanovaccines. Improvements in vaccine responses recapitulate when DNA‐launched nanovaccines with alternative scaffolds and decorated antigen are designed and evaluated. Finally, evaluation of functional immune responses induced by DLnanovaccines demonstrates that, in comparison to control mice or mice immunized with DNA‐encoded hemagglutinin monomer, mice immunized with a DNA‐launched hemagglutinin nanoparticle vaccine fully survive a lethal influenza challenge, and have substantially lower viral load, weight loss, and influenza‐induced lung pathology. Additional study of these next‐generation in vivo‐produced nanovaccines may offer advantages for immunization against multiple disease targets.","Xu, Ziyang; Wise, Megan C.; Chokkalingam, Neethu; Walker, Susanne; Tello‐Ruiz, Edgar; Elliott, Sarah T.

HLH associated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is uncommon. This case report accounted an immunocompetent patient who was confirmed to be Mycobacterium infection, or rather, highly suspected tuberculosis (TB) associated HLH, with a favorable outcome. CASE PRESENTATION: A 36-year-old man presented with persistent fever, pancytopenia, and hyperferritinemia. A bone marrow smear demonstrated hemophagocytosis, and pathological examination of lung biopsy was positive for acid-fast bacilli, which established the diagnosis of Mycobacterium infection and HLH. Then the patient treated successfully with anti-TB therapy, along with 8 weeks of etoposide. CONCLUSION: This case emphasizes that HLH should be kept in mind when clinicians encounter a patient with severe infection presenting with pancytopenia and hyperferritinemia.

To address the global epidemic of obesity and move toward more personalized treatment regimens, the global research community must come together to identify factors that may drive these heterogeneous responses to interventions. This project, called OBEDIS (OBEsity Diverse Interventions Sharing − focusing on dietary and other interventions), provides a set of European guidelines for a minimal set of variables to include in future clinical trials on obesity, regardless of the specific endpoints. Broad adoption of these guidelines will enable researchers to harmonize and merge data from multiple intervention studies, allowing stratification of patients according to precise phenotyping criteria which are measured using standardized methods. In this way, studies across Europe may be pooled for better prediction of individuals' responses to an intervention for obesity − ultimately leading to better patient care and improved obesity outcomes.","Alligier, Maud; Barrès, Romain; Blaak, Ellen E.; Boirie, Yves; Bouwman, Jildau; Brunault, Paul; Campbell, Kristina; Clément, Karine; Farooqi, I.

13363,Mitteilungen der DGKFO,2020-10-21,"BACKGROUND: Bovine besnoitiosis, an emerging disease in Europe that can be transmitted by vectors, is caused by the apicomplexan Besnoitia besnoiti. Bovine besnoitiosis is difficult to control due to the complexity of its diagnosis in the acute stage of the disease, poor treatment success and chronically asymptomatic cattle acting as parasite reservoirs. When serological prevalence is low, detection and specific culling of seropositive cattle is feasible; however, economic considerations preclude this approach when serological prevalence is high. The aims of this study were to evaluate the accuracy of detection of super-spreaders in highly infected herds and to test their selective elimination as a new control strategy for bovine besnoitiosis. METHODS: Previous real-time PCR analyses performed on skin tissues from 160 asymptomatic animals sampled at slaughterhouses showed that the tail base was the best location to evaluate the dermal parasite DNA load. All seropositive animals (n = 518) from eight dairy or beef cattle farms facing a high serological prevalence of besnoitiosis were sampled at the tail base and their skin sample analysed by real-time PCR. A recommendation of rapid and selective culling of super-spreaders was formulated and provided to the cattle breeders. Subsequent serological monitoring of naïve animals was used to evaluate the interest of this control strategy over time. RESULTS: Among the 518 seropositive animals, a low proportion of individuals (14.5%) showed Cq values below 36, 17.8% had doubtful results (36 < Cq ≤ 40) and 67.8% had negative PCR results. These proportions were grossly similar on the eight farms, regardless of their production type (beef or dairy cattle), size, geographical location or history of besnoitiosis. Within two weeks of the biopsy, the rapid culling of super-spreaders was implemented on only three farms. The numbers of newly infected animals were lower on these farms compared to those where super-spreaders were maintained in the herd. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time PCR analyses performed on skin biopsies of seropositive cattle showed huge individual variabilities in parasite DNA load. The rapid culling of individuals considered as super-spreaders seems to be a new and encouraging strategy for bovine besnoitiosis control.

Current therapies for PD are ultimately inadequate, both in terms of symptom control and in modification of disease progression. Deep brain stimulation and infusion therapies are the current mainstay for treatment of motor complications of advanced disease, but these have very significant drawbacks and offer no element of disease modification. In fact, there are currently no agents that are established to modify the course of the disease in clinical use for PD. Gene and cell therapies for PD are now being trialled in the clinic. These treatments are diverse and may have a range of niches in the management of PD. They hold great promise for improved treatment of symptoms as well as possibly slowing progression of the disease in the right patient group.

15318,Mitteilungen der DGN,2021-02-09,"PURPOSE: In adults requiring treatment in an intensive care unit, probiotic therapy using Lactobacillus plantarum 299v may reduce nosocomial infection. The aim of this study was to determine whether early and sustained L. plantarum 299v therapy administered to adult ICU patients increased days alive and at home. METHODS: A multicentre, parallel group, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial was conducted. Adult patients within 48 h of intensive care admission and expected to require intensive care beyond the day after recruitment were eligible to participate. L plantarum 299v or placebo were administered immediately after enrolment and continued for 60 days. The primary outcome was days alive and out of hospital to Day 60 (DAOH(60)). Secondary outcomes included nosocomial infections. RESULTS: The median [interquartile range (IQR)] number of DAOH(60) in the probiotic (n = 110) and placebo group (n = 108) was 49.5 (IQR 37.0–53.0) and 49.0 (IQR 43.8–53.0) respectively, between-group difference of 0.0 [95% confidence interval (CI) − 6.10 to 7.1, P = 0.55]. Nosocomial infection occurred in 8 (7.3%) and 5 (4.6%) of the probiotic and placebo group participants, respectively, odds ratio 1.62 (95% CI 0.51–5.10), P = 0.57. There were no serious, or probiotic-associated adverse events. CONCLUSION: Early and sustained untargeted administration of probiotic therapy with Lactobacillus plantarum 299v to adult patients admitted to the ICU is safe, but not associated with improved patient outcomes.

17261,Thrombektomie in der klinischen Praxis – Was lernen wir aus Registerstudien?,2021-05-03,"Rapid economic development has caused industrial expansion into residential communities, leading to higher fecal pollution loads that could be discharged into aquatic environments. However, little is known regarding the potential microbial impact on human health. This study investigated microbial contamination from coastal industrial–residential community areas in nine sampling sites in waterways during three dry events. A general microbial source tracking (MST) marker, GenBac3, was detected in all samples from all three events, indicating continuing fecal pollution in the area, mostly from human sewage contamination. This was shown by the human-specific genetic marker crAssphage (88.9%) and human polyomavirus (HPyVs; 92.6%) detection. Enteric human adenovirus (HAdV40/41) showed three positive results only from residential sites in the first event. No spatial difference was observed for MST markers and traditional fecal indicators (total coliforms and Escherichia coli) in each event. Still, a significantly lower abundance of GenBac3, HPyVs, and total coliforms in the first sampling event was detected. Spearman’s rho analysis indicated a strong correlation among certain pairs of microbial parameters. Multivariate analysis revealed two clusters of samples separated by land use type (industrial vs. residential). According to factor analysis of mixed data, the land use parameter was more associated with physicochemical parameters (i.e., salinity, conductivity, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen). A Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) was then conducted to estimate the annual infection risks of HAdV40/41 for non-potable water reuse purposes using predicted concentrations from crAssphage and HPyVs. The highest risks (95th percentiles) were ranked by food crop irrigation, aquaculture, and toilet flushing, at 10(–1), 10(–2), and 10(–3) per person per year (pppy). Required treatment levels to achieve a 10(–4) pppy annual infection risk were estimated. QMRA-based water treatment scenarios were suggested, including chlorination for toilet flushing reuse and depth filtration prior to chlorination for aquaculture and food crop irrigation. Microbial monitoring combined with a QMRA could provide better insights into fecal pollution patterns and the associated risks, facilitating effective water quality management and appropriate prior treatments for water reuse.","Kongprajug, Akechai; Denpetkul, Thammanitchpol; Chyerochana, Natcha; Mongkolsuk, Skorn; Sirikanchana, Kwanrawee",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8093506/,453

It influences acid–base balance and can also cause prognostically relevant biotrauma by generating forces and liberating reactive oxygen species, negatively affecting outcomes. In this work we evaluate the use of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) modelling to predict outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients, using standard mechanical ventilation parameters. METHODS: We performed our analysis on VENTILA dataset, an observational, prospective, international, multi-centre study, performed to investigate the effect of baseline characteristics and management changes over time on the all-cause mortality rate in mechanically ventilated patients in ICU. Our cohort includes 12,596 adult patients older than 18, associated with 12,755 distinct admissions in ICUs across 37 countries and receiving invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation. We carry out four different analysis. Initially we select typical mechanical ventilation parameters and evaluate the machine learning model on both, the overall cohort and a subgroup of patients admitted with respiratory disorders. Furthermore, we carry out sensitivity analysis to evaluate whether inclusion of variables related to the function of other organs, improve the predictive performance of the model for both the overall cohort as well as the subgroup of patients with respiratory disorders. RESULTS: Predictive performance of RNN-based model was higher with Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) of 0.72 (± 0.01) and Average Precision (AP) of 0.57 (± 0.01) in comparison to RF and LR for the overall patient dataset. Higher predictive performance was recorded in the subgroup of patients admitted with respiratory disorders with AUC of 0.75 (± 0.02) and AP of 0.65 (± 0.03). Inclusion of function of other organs further improved the performance to AUC of 0.79 (± 0.01) and AP 0.68 (± 0.02) for the overall patient dataset and AUC of 0.79 (± 0.01) and AP 0.72 (± 0.02) for the subgroup with respiratory disorders. CONCLUSION: The RNN-based model demonstrated better performance than RF and LR in patients in mechanical ventilation and its subgroup admitted with respiratory disorders.

ABSTRACT: Endocrine therapy (ET) has established itself as an efficacious treatment for estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers, with a reduction in recurrence rates and increased survival rates. The pre-surgical approach with chemotherapy (NCT) has become a common form of management for large, locally advanced, or high-risk tumors. However, a good response to NCT is not usually expected in ER+ tumors. Good results with primary ET, mainly in elderly women, have encouraged studies in other stages of life, and nowadays neoadjuvant endocrine treatment (NET) has become a useful approach to many ER+ breast cancers. The aim of this review is to provide an update on the current state of art regarding the present and the future role of NET.","Martí, Covadonga; Sánchez-Méndez, José Ignacio",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8196711/,453

In the PRADA trial (Prevention of Cardiac Dysfunction During Adjuvant Breast Cancer Therapy), concomitant treatment with the angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan attenuated the reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in women receiving treatment for breast cancer, whereas the β-blocker metoprolol attenuated the increase in cardiac troponins. This study aimed to assess the long-term effects of candesartan and metoprolol or their combination to prevent a reduction in cardiac function and myocardial injury. METHODS: In this 2×2 factorial, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-center trial, patients with early breast cancer were assigned to concomitant treatment with candesartan cilexetil, metoprolol succinate, or matching placebos. Target doses were 32 and 100 mg, respectively. Study drugs were discontinued after adjuvant therapy. All 120 validly randomized patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The primary outcome measure was change in LVEF assessed by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging from baseline to extended follow-up. Secondary outcome measures included changes in left ventricular volumes, echocardiographic peak global longitudinal strain, and circulating cardiac troponin concentrations. RESULTS: A small decline in LVEF but no significant between-group differences were observed from baseline to extended follow-up, at a median of 23 months (interquartile range, 21 to 28 months) after randomization (candesartan, 1.7% [95% CI, 0.5 to 2.8]; no candesartan, 1.8% [95% CI, 0.6 to 3.0]; metoprolol, 1.6% [95% CI, 0.4 to 2.7]; no metoprolol, 1.9% [95% CI, 0.7 to 3.0]). Candesartan treatment during adjuvant therapy was associated with a significant reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic volume compared with the noncandesartan group (P=0.021) and attenuated decline in global longitudinal strain (P=0.046) at 2 years. No between-group differences in change in cardiac troponin I and T concentrations were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Anthracycline-containing adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer was associated with a decline in LVEF during extended follow-up. Candesartan during adjuvant therapy did not prevent reduction in LVEF at 2 years, but was associated with modest reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic volume and preserved global longitudinal strain. These results suggest that a broadly administered cardioprotective approach may not be required in most patients with early breast cancer without preexisting cardiovascular disease.

18446,Versorgung und Teilhabe im Quartier – Beiträge stationärer Pflegeeinrichtungen,2021-06-23,"BACKGROUND: This antimicrobial surveillance study reports in vitro antimicrobial activity and susceptibility data for a panel of agents against respiratory isolates of Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. METHODS: Isolates from respiratory specimens were collected in Africa/Middle East, Asia/South Pacific, Europe and Latin America between 2016 and 2018, as part of the Antimicrobial Testing Leadership and Surveillance (ATLAS) program. Broth microdilution methodology was used to quantify minimum inhibitory concentrations, from which rates of susceptibility were determined using EUCAST breakpoints (version 10). Rates of subsets with genes encoding β-lactamases (extended-spectrum β-lactamases [ESBLs], serine carbapenemases and metallo-β-lactamases [MBLs]) were also determined, as well as rates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa. RESULTS: Among all respiratory Enterobacterales isolates, susceptibility to ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem, colistin and amikacin was ≥94.4% in each region. For Enterobacterales isolates that were ESBL-positive or carbapenemase-positive/MBL-negative, ceftazidime-avibactam susceptibility was 93.6 and 98.9%, respectively. Fewer than 42.7% of MBL-positive Enterobacterales isolates were susceptible to any agents, except colistin (89.0% susceptible). Tigecycline susceptibility was ≥90.0% among Citrobacter koseri and Escherichia coli isolates, including all β-lactamase-positive subsets. ESBL-positive Enterobacterales were more commonly identified in each region than isolates that were ESBL/carbapenemase-positive; carbapenemase-positive/MBL-negative; or MBL-positive. Among all respiratory P. aeruginosa isolates, the combined susceptibility rates (susceptible at standard dosing regimen plus susceptible at increased exposure) were highest to ceftazidime-avibactam, colistin and amikacin (≥82.4% in each region). Susceptibility to colistin was ≥98.1% for all β-lactamase-positive subsets of P. aeruginosa. The lowest rates of antimicrobial susceptibility were observed among MBL-positive isolates of P. aeruginosa (≤56.6%), with the exception of colistin (100% susceptible). MDR P. aeruginosa were most frequently identified in each region (18.7–28.7%), compared with the subsets of ESBL-positive; carbapenemase-positive/MBL-negative; or MBL-positive isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of susceptibility among the collections of respiratory Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa isolates were highest to ceftazidime-avibactam, colistin and amikacin in each region. Tigecycline was active against all subsets of C. koseri and E. coli, and colistin was active against all subsets of P. aeruginosa. The findings of this study indicate the need for continued antimicrobial surveillance among respiratory Gram-negative pathogens, in particular those with genes encoding MBLs.

METHOD: Children, aged 6 to <11 years, having myopia −4.00 D to −0.75 D, were randomly assigned to wear ortho‐k lenses with 6 mm (6‐MM group) or 5 mm (5‐MM group) BOZD. Data collection included changes in refraction, vision, lens performance and binding, ocular health conditions, axial length and characteristics of the treatment zone (TZ) area. RESULTS: The 1‐year results of 34 and 36 subjects (right eye only) in the 6‐MM and 5‐MM groups, respectively, are presented. No significant differences in baseline demographics were found between the groups (p > 0.05). The first‐fit success rates, based on satisfactory centration at the 1‐month visit, were 100% and 94% respectively. Horizontal TZ size was 0.92 mm and 0.72 mm smaller in the 5‐MM group at the 6‐month and 12‐month visits, respectively (p < 0.05). At the 12‐month visit, no significant between‐group differences were found in the incidence of corneal staining (low grade only), lens binding and visual performance (all p > 0.05). Axial elongation was slower in the 5‐MM group (0.04 ± 0.15 mm) than the 6‐MM group (0.17 ± 0.13 mm) (p = 0.001). A significant positive correlation was observed between the horizontal TZ size and axial elongation (r = 0.36, p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Clinical performance of the two ortho‐k lenses was similar, indicating that a smaller BOZD (5 mm) did not affect lens performance or ocular integrity. However, a smaller BOZD led to a reduced TZ, with retardation of axial elongation by 0.13 mm compared to conventional 6 mm BOZD ortho‐k lenses after one year of lens wear.","Guo, Biyue; Cheung, Sin Wan; Kojima, Randy; Cho, Pauline",Ophthalmic Physiol Opt,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8251614/,453

Recent A(H1N1) studies suggest that intrapersonal and interpersonal factors may exert influence on people’s preventive behaviors for avoiding the flu during pandemics. Aims. Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and vaccinations play key roles in containing disease transmission during a pandemic. We examined how intrapersonal and interpersonal factors influenced adoption of NPIs and vaccine uptake during the A(H1N1) pandemic of 2009. Method. The data come from a nationally representative sample survey of 1,569 American adults. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was conducted to investigate the association between socioeconomic position, concern and knowledge about the threat, social networks for health advice or health care seeking, health consultations with doctors, and NPIs (including individual’s social distancing behaviors and hygiene practices) and vaccine acceptance. Results. People with higher scores on health-related social networks, more knowledge or concern about A(H1N1), and those who have consulted their doctor were more likely than others to adopt NPIs. There was a significant association between being concerned about A(H1N1), having consulted a doctor, and seeking a vaccine. Conclusions. These findings suggest that interpersonal communication factors, such as health-related social networks and consultations with doctors, and intrapersonal factors, such as concern and knowledge, play a critical role in NPIs and vaccine uptake during pandemics and offer avenues for intervention.","Lin, Leesa; McCloud, Rachel F.; Jung, Minsoo; Viswanath, Kasisomayajula",Health Educ Behav,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8280549/,453

STUDY DESIGN: Data from the Children’s Hospitals Neonatal Consortium were classified by 2018 NICHD, 2019 NRN, and Canadian Neonatal Network (CNN) BPD definitions. Multivariable models evaluated the associations between BPD severity and death, tracheostomy, or length of stay, relative to No BPD references. RESULTS: Mortality was highest in 2019 NRN Grade 3 infants (aOR 225), followed by 2018 NICHD Grade 3 (aOR 145). Infants with lower BPD grades rarely died (<1%), but Grade 2 infants had aOR 7–21-fold higher for death and 23–56-fold higher for tracheostomy. CONCLUSIONS: Definitions with 3 BPD grades had better discrimination and Grade 3 2019 NRN had the strongest association with outcomes. No/Grade 1 infants rarely had severe outcomes, but Grade 2 infants were at risk.

Lupus nephritis (LN) is associated with high mortality and morbidity. However, plenty of patients do not respond to present treatment or relapse. Iguratimod (IGU) is a new small molecular, anti-rheumatic drug and has shown the potential for drug repurposing from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to LN treatment. It has been approved for treating RA in northeast Asia. Beyond expectation in a recent observational study, over 90% of thirteen refractory LN patients responded to iguratimod monotherapy in 24 weeks, with no steroids dose increasing or any other medication add-on during the entire follow-up. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a multi-center, randomized, 52-week parallel positive drug-controlled study. The study was designed as a head-to-head comparison between the iguratimod and present first-line therapy on LN patients. A total of 120 patients (60 patients each group) is in the enrolling plan. All enrolled patients are assigned randomly into trial and control groups. The patients will be selected from six study sites in China and will all have biopsy-proven active lupus nephritis. In the first 24 weeks of the trial, IGU is compared with cyclophosphamide as an induction therapy, and in the second 24 weeks, IGU is compared with azathioprine as a maintenance therapy. The primary outcome is renal remission rate including both complete remission and partial remission at week 52, which will be analyzed using a non-inferiority hypothesis test. DISCUSSION: Most patients diagnosed with SLE will develop LN within 5 years and LN remains a major cause of morbidity and death for SLE patients. Although some medications are proven effective for the treatment of this condition, at least 20–35% LN patients have to suffer from relapse or ineffective treatment and medication intolerance is also frequent. This trial is designed to demonstrate whether iguratimod can be used as an alternative induction or maintenance therapy in subjects who have lupus nephritis. Data from this study will provide an evidence on whether or not iguratimod should be recommended to active LN patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.govNCT 02936375.

Here, we briefly summarize the vaccine strategies and vaccine candidates that in recent years advanced to efficacy trials with mostly unsatisfactory results. Next, we discuss a novel and somewhat contrarian approach based on biological and epidemiological evidence, which led us to choose the HIV protein Tat for the development of preventive and therapeutic HIV vaccines. Toward this goal, we review here the role of Tat in the virus life cycle as well as experimental and epidemiological evidence supporting its key role in the natural history of HIV infection and comorbidities. We then discuss the preclinical and clinical development of a Tat therapeutic vaccine, which, by improving the functionality and homeostasis of the immune system and by reducing the viral reservoir in virologically suppressed vaccinees, helps to establish key determinants for intensification of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and a functional cure. Future developments and potential applications of the Tat therapeutic vaccine are also discussed, as well as the rationale for its use in preventative strategies. We hope this contribution will lead to a reconsideration of the current paradigms for the development of HIV/AIDS vaccines, with a focus on targeting of viral proteins with key roles in HIV pathogenesis.","Ensoli, Barbara; Moretti, Sonia; Borsetti, Alessandra; Maggiorella, Maria Teresa; Buttò, Stefano; Picconi, Orietta; Tripiciano, Antonella; Sgadari, Cecilia; Monini, Paolo; Cafaro, Aurelio",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8363864/,453

This study included preterm infants with a gestational age of 26 + 0 to 31 + 6 weeks who required intubation in the delivery room. We prospectively identified 40 infants who underwent the EMMA™ monitoring intervention group and 43 infants who did not undergo monitoring (historical control group). PaCO(2) was evaluated either at admission in the neonatal intensive care unit or at 2 h after birth. The proportion of infants with an appropriate PaCO(2) (35–60 mmHg) was greater in the intervention group than in the control group (80% vs. 42%; p = 0.001). There were no significant differences in the rate of accidental extubation (5.0% vs. 7.0%, p = 1.00) or in the proportion of infants with an appropriate PaCO(2) among infants whose birth weight was < 1000 g (54% vs. 40%, p = 0.49).

We analyzed risk factors of lower respiratory tract infection after general anesthesia among older patients. METHODS: In this retrospective investigation, we included older patients who underwent surgery with general anesthesia. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine risk factors of lower respiratory tract infection. RESULTS: A total 418 postoperative patients with general anesthesia were included; the incidence of lower respiratory tract infection was 9.33%. Ten cases were caused by gram-positive bacteria, 26 cases by gram-negative bacteria, and 2 cases by fungus. We found significant differences in age, smoking, diabetes, oral/nasal tracheal intubation, and surgery duration. Logistic regression analysis indicated that age ≥70 years (odds ratio [OR] 2.028, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.115–3.646), smoking (OR 2.314, 95% CI 1.073–4.229), diabetes (OR 2.185, 95% CI 1.166–4.435), nasotracheal intubation (OR 3.528, 95% CI 1.104–5.074), and duration of surgery ≥180 minutes (OR 1.334, 95% CI 1.015–1.923) were independent risk factors of lower respiratory tract infections.

Ongoing LAMP reactions within the emulsion droplets cause a decrease in interfacial tension, causing a decrease in droplet size, which results in decreased light scatter intensity due to Mie theory. Light scatter intensity was monitored via spectrophotometers and fiber optic cables placed at 30° and 60°. Light scatter intensities collected at 3 min, 30° were able to statistically differentiate 10(3) and 10(6) CFU/µL initial Escherichia coli O157:H7 concentrations compared to NTC (0 CFU/µL), while the intensity at 60° were able to statistically differentiate 10(6) CFU/µL initial concentrations and NTC. Control experiments were conducted to validate nucleic acid detection versus bacterial adsorption, finding that the light scatter intensities change is due specifically to ongoing LAMP amplification. After inducing contamination of bulk LAMP reagents, specificity lowered to 0% with conventional LAMP, while the eLAMP platform showed 87.5% specificity. We have demonstrated the use of angle-dependent light scatter intensity as a means of real-time monitoring of an emulsion LAMP platform and fabricated a smartphone-based monitoring system that showed similar trends as spectrophotometer light scatter data, validating the technology for a field deployable platform.","Day, Alexander S.; Ulep, Tiffany-Heather; Budiman, Elizabeth; Dieckhaus, Laurel; Safavinia, Babak; Hertenstein, Tyler; Yoon, Jeong-Yeol",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8497611/,453

EIDs are usually discovered in three ways. Firstly, some existing diseases are ascertained as EIDs due to the recent discovery of pathogens. Secondly, previously considered noninfectious diseases are identified contagious as a result of new etiological findings. Thirdly, new infectious diseases are incurred by various complicated reasons such as evolution of pathogens. Due to their uncertainty and unpredictability, EIDs could result in high mortality and great impacts on social stability and economic development as people are unable to react immediately and take specific preventive or control measures. Therefore, EIDs have become a major public health problem worldwide. Cases in point are the epidemics of SARS in 2003 and H7N9 avian influenza around 2006, which have eloquently demonstrated their great threats to human health, society, and economy.

Inspite of extensive research efforts and scientific advancements, the worldwide emergence of microbial tolerance continues to plague survivability. The innate property of microbe to resist any antibiotic due to evolution is the virtue of intrinsic resistance. However, the classical genetic mutations and extrachromosomal segments causing gene exchange attribute to acquired tolerance development. Rampant use of antimicrobials causes certain selection pressure which increases the resistance frequency. Genomic duplication, enzymatic site modification, target alteration, modulation in membrane permeability, and the efflux pump mechanism are the major contributors of multidrug resistance (MDR), specifically antibiotic tolerance development. MDRs will lead to clinical failures for treatment and pose health crisis. The molecular mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance are diverse as well as complex and still are exploited for new discoveries in order to prevent the surfacing of “superbugs.” Antimicrobial chemotherapy has diminished the threat of infectious diseases to some extent. To avoid the indiscriminate use of antibiotics, the new ones licensed for use have decreased with time. Additionally, in vitro assays and genomics for anti-infectives are novel approaches used in resolving the issues of microbial resistance. Proper use of drugs can keep it under check and minimize the risk of MDR spread.","Ray, Shilpa; Das, Susmita; Suar, Mrutyunjay","Drug Resistance in Bacteria, Fungi, Malaria, and Cancer",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122190/,453

Opportunities for therapeutic intervention were limited to only a few applications such as herpesvirus infections, influenza, and HIV/AIDS; hence, once a bacterial or fungal infection was excluded, clinicians were limited to providing supportive care for what was presumed to be a viral syndrome. Public health organizations tracked the incidence of viral infections and the development of resistance to the few antiviral drugs in use and provided input to governments and the pharmaceutical industry regarding selection of vaccine targets. More recently, interest in viral diagnostics has burgeoned with the advent of new tools for detection and discovery, global recognition of pandemic risk, high-throughput drug screening, rational drug design, and immunotherapeutics. An additional impetus has been the implication of viruses in chronic illnesses not previously attributed to infection.

However, certain contagious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis, pneumonic plague, viral hemorrhagic fever) require transmission-based precautions to protect the other patients, medical personnel, and aircrew. AE planning for these patients must take into account international public health regulations. Given adequate resources, foresight, and expertise, the AE of infected patients and biologic warfare casualties can be safely accomplished. This chapter provides a review of the aeromedical evacuation of patients with communicable diseases. Topics include a review of the ecology of aircraft cabins and engineering features of aircraft ventilation systems that minimize the risk of disease transmission; examples of point source outbreaks related to air travel; in-flight preventive measures including the use of patient isolators; and US military and international policy and legal aspects of transporting patients with communicable diseases. Examples include in-flight transmission of tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), smallpox, and measles.The chapter will also discuss experience in transporting patients with contagious diseases including viral hemorrhagic fevers and new patient isolation technologies that were used for the long-distance transport of patients with Ebola virus disease during the 2014–2016 West African epidemic.","Garibaldi, Brian T.; Conger, Nicholas G.; Withers, Mark R.; Hatfill, Steven J.; Gutierrez-Nunez, Jose J.; Christopher, George W.",Aeromedical Evacuation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123148/,453

These big data can be easily generated and collected from a wide variety of data sources. A data science framework—such as predictive analytics framework—helps mining data from various big data sources to find useful information and discover knowledge, which can then be transformed into wisdom for appropriate actions. In this paper, we present an innovative big data predictive analytics framework over hybrid big data sources. To demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our framework, we conduct several case studies, including one on applying the framework to disease analytics. More specifically, we integrate, incorporate and analyze weather data and web-search data to predict and forecast dengue cases based on a hybrid of three kernels in support vector machine (SVM) ensemble. Results show how our predictive analytics framework benefits health agencies in disease control and prevention.","Souza, Joglas; Leung, Carson K.; Cuzzocrea, Alfredo",Advanced Information Networking and Applications,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123615/,453

One of the clearest cases of embryonic resilience thinking includes Medieval Venice, which was forced to grapple with the recurring threat of plague that threatened to destroy the fabric of European society and cripple the juggernaut of Venetian maritime trade (Linkov et al. 2014a, b, c, d, e; Lane 1973). This early resilience thinking did not fully inoculate Venetian society from the ravages of disease—on the contrary, limitations of medical knowledge and border control allowed for outbreaks throughout the early modern era—yet it did allow Venetian policymakers to begin to address the question of how to combat deadly disease. The cumulative successes in reducing disease incidence and spread throughout the city and its dependent settlements eventually brought policymakers to embrace resilience thinking for other unrelated projects ranging from climate change to land reclamation efforts—all centered on the idea of strengthening Venetian social, economic, and cultural capabilities in the midst of an uncertain future (Vergano and Nunes 2007; Linkov et al. 2014a, b, c, d, e).

Yet the industrial revolution transformed not just how firms made things, but the fundamental approach to value creation in industrial economies. To date, big data has not achieved this distinction. Instead, today’s successful big data business models largely use data to scale old modes of value creation, rather than invent new ones altogether. Moreover, today’s big data cannot deliver the promised revolution. In this way, today’s big data landscape resembles the early phases of the first industrial revolution, rather than the culmination of the second a century later. Realizing the second big data revolution will require fundamentally different kinds of data, different innovations, and different business models than those seen to date. That fact has profound consequences for the kinds of investments and innovations firms must seek, and the economic, political, and social consequences that those innovations portend.","Huberty, Mark",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149011/,453

Lipid forms an integral part of many viruses and exists either in the form of a continuous envelope or in lipoprotein complexes that surround a nucleoprotein core or helix. In general, the envelope can be described as a molecular container for the genetic material of the virus. Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites and are not known to carry genetic coding for enzymes involved in lipid synthesis. Hence, they generally contain the same classes of lipid as are found in the host cell or their membrane of assembly. Lipids make up 20–35% by weight of most viruses; however, there are exceptions such as vaccinia virus, which has only 5% lipid despite having a complex multimembrane envelope structure. Naked herpesvirus capsids closely resemble non-lipid-containing viruses such as adenovirus or polyoma virus, which are also assembled in the nucleus but show full infectivity without any envelope. Both naked and enveloped herpesvirus particles are found in infected cells; however, only enveloped particles are found in extracellular fluids.","BLOUGH, HERBERT A.; TIFFANY, JOHN M.",Adv Lipid Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173472/,453

Such an assessment is traditionally accomplished by means of the loan-to-deposit ratio that captures rather size or depth of financial intermediation, but no link is sought to best practices that are observed in the banking sector. The paper proposes a model of financial intermediation that permits assessing on a comparative basis the attainment in financial intermediation. The devised index of financial intermediation recognizes through weights that diverse outcomes of financial intermediation exhibit differentiated importance to the economy and is closely connected with the weighted slacks-based measure (WSBM). The WSBM that emerges in this respect encompasses only production variables that define financial intermediation (i.e. deposits and intermediated outputs) whilst other production variables are treated as non-discretionary. The model can be applied in variants for a single commercial bank in one specific year (Model I) or for aggregated bank-years such as one particular bank over the entire period or various banks in one year (Model II). The ideas are demonstrated on a data set of Slovak commercial banks for the period between 2008 and 2016 and the difference of the proposed approach with traditional efficiency measurement under the intermediation approach is discussed.","Boďa, Martin; Zimková, Emília",Econ Change Restruct,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7269423/,453

While the representation of women in STEM classrooms has grown rapidly in recent years, it remains pedagogically meaningful to understand whether their learning outcomes are achieved in different ways than male students. In this study, we explored this issue through the lens of language in the context of an asynchronous online discussion forum. We applied Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) to examine linguistic features of students’ reflective posting in an online chemistry class at a four-year university. Our results suggest that cognitive linguistic features significantly predict the likelihood of passing the course and increases perceived sense of belonging. However, these results only hold true for female students. Pronouns and words relevant to social presence correlate with passing the course in different directions, and this mixed relationship is more polarized among male students. Interestingly, the linguistic features per se do not differ significantly between genders. Overall, our findings provide a more nuanced account of the relationship between linguistic signals of social/cognitive presence and learning outcomes.

Over time, more students join online learning, but instructors have no equivalent increase in support to manage their online classes, leaving students under-served. This is evidenced by the number of students who dropout or fail online courses, blaming the “lack of support” from instructors. Interactions in such courses generate considerable quantity and diversity of data, allowing the extraction of pedagogically relevant information. However, instructors do not master the techniques and technologies needed to do it, and it is not practical to train them to do so. In this work, we propose an authoring tool (called T-Partner) that implements a process we created to deal with educational data. The objective is to support instructors making informed pedagogical decisions to manage their online course. T-Partner promotes the cooperation between artificial and human intelligences, however we do not know the appropriate balance between these “intelligences”. We then created two versions of the T-Partner to help instructors to: (1) find relevant pedagogical situations occurring within their online courses; (2) understand these situations; (3) create interventions (study plans, for example) to address these situations; (4) monitor and evaluate the impact of these interventions. We evaluated if both versions allowed instructors to make pedagogical decisions and their perceptions regarding this support to decision-making.

However, one important aspect of student behaviour, namely its evolution over time, can often be challenging to identify using existing methods. This is because the objective functions used by these methods do not explicitly aim to find cluster trends in time, so these trends may not be clearly represented in the results. This paper presents ‘DETECT’ (Detection of Educational Trends Elicited by Clustering Time-series data), a novel divisive hierarchical clustering algorithm that incorporates temporal information into its objective function to prioritise the detection of behavioural trends. The resulting clusters are similar in structure to a decision tree, with a hierarchy of clusters defined by decision rules on features. DETECT is easy to apply, highly customisable, applicable to a wide range of educational datasets and yields easily interpretable results.

Distinctive from other domains, language learning often requires teachers to assess each student’s ability to speak the language, making this process even more time-consuming in large classrooms which are particularly common in post-secondary settings; considering that language instructors often assess students through assignments requiring recorded audio, a lack of tools to support such teachers makes providing individual feedback even more challenging. In this work, we seek to explore the development of tools to automatically assess audio responses within a college-level Chinese language-learning course. We build a model designed to grade student audio assignments with the purpose of incorporating such a model into tools focused on helping both teachers and students in real classrooms. Building upon our prior work which explored features extracted from audio, the goal of this work is to explore additional features derived from tone and speech recognition models to help assess students on two outcomes commonly observed in language learning classes: fluency and accuracy of speech. In addition to the exploration of features, this work explores the application of Siamese deep learning models for this assessment task. We find that models utilizing tonal features exhibit higher predictive performance of student fluency while text-based features derived from speech recognition models exhibit higher predictive performance of student accuracy of speech.","Varatharaj, Ashvini; Botelho, Anthony F.; Lu, Xiwen; Heffernan, Neil T.",Artificial Intelligence in Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334164/,453

Counting and uniform sampling are fundamental problems in computer science with a wide range of applications ranging from constrained random simulation, probabilistic inference to network reliability and beyond. The past few years have witnessed the rise of hashing-based approaches that use XOR-based hashing and employ SAT solvers to solve the resulting CNF formulas conjuncted with XOR constraints. Since over 99% of the runtime of hashing-based techniques is spent inside the SAT queries, improving CNF-XOR solvers has emerged as a key challenge. In this paper, we identify the key performance bottlenecks in the recently proposed [Formula: see text] architecture, and we focus on overcoming these bottlenecks by accelerating the XOR handling within the SAT solver and on improving the solver integration through a smarter use of (partial) solutions. We integrate the resulting system, called [Formula: see text], with the state of the art approximate model counter, [Formula: see text], and the state of the art almost-uniform model sampler [Formula: see text]. Through an extensive evaluation over a large benchmark set of over 1896 instances, we observe that [Formula: see text] leads to consistent speed up for both counting and sampling, and in particular, we solve 77 and 51 more instances for counting and sampling respectively.","Soos, Mate; Gocht, Stephan; Meel, Kuldeep S.",Computer Aided Verification,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7363182/,453

Mild infections are common in children; however, HFMD can also cause severe illness that affects the central nervous system. To molecularly characterize EVs, a prospective HFMD virological surveillance program was performed in China between 2013 and 2016. Throat swabs, rectal swabs and stool samples were collected from suspected HFMD patients at participating hospitals. EVs were detected using generic real-time and nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs). Then, the complete VP1 regions of enterovirus A71 (EV-A71), coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) and CVA6 were sequenced to analyze amino acid changes and construct a viral molecular phylogeny. Of the 2836 enrolled HFMD patients, 2,517 (89%) were EV positive. The most frequently detected EVs were CVA16 (32.5%, 819), CVA6 (31.2%, 785), and EV-A71 (20.4%, 514). The subgenogroups CVA16_B1b, CVA6_D3a and EV-A71_C4a were predominant in China and recombination was not observed in the VP1 region. Sequence analysis revealed amino acid variations at the 30, 29 and 44 positions in the VP1 region of EV-A71, CVA16 and CVA6 (compared to the respective prototype strains BrCr, G10 and Gdula), respectively. Furthermore, in 21 of 24 (87.5%) identified EV-A71 samples, a known amino acid substitution (D31N) that may enhance neurovirulence was detected. Our study provides insights about the genetic characteristics of common HFMD-associated EVs. However, the emergence and virulence of the described mutations require further investigation.

37468,245 - 16 - 19: Zahlenspiele in der Praxis-EDV: Umsetzung der Hygiene-Analogziffer und Umsatzsteuersenkung,2020-08-13,"BACKGROUND: The driving pressure of the respiratory system is a valuable indicator of global lung stress during passive mechanical ventilation. Monitoring lung stress in assisted ventilation is indispensable, but achieving passive conditions in spontaneously breathing patients to measure driving pressure is challenging. The accuracy of the morphology of airway pressure (Paw) during end-inspiratory occlusion to assure passive conditions during pressure support ventilation has not been examined. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of end-inspiratory occlusions obtained from critically ill patients during pressure support ventilation. Flow, airway, esophageal, gastric, and transdiaphragmatic pressures were analyzed. The rise of gastric pressure during occlusion with a constant/decreasing transdiaphragmatic pressure was used to identify and quantify the expiratory muscle activity. The Paw during occlusion was classified in three patterns, based on the differences at three pre-defined points after occlusion (0.3, 1, and 2 s): a “passive-like” decrease followed by plateau, a pattern with “clear plateau,” and an “irregular rise” pattern, which included all cases of late or continuous increase, with or without plateau. RESULTS: Data from 40 patients and 227 occlusions were analyzed. Expiratory muscle activity during occlusion was identified in 79% of occlusions, and at all levels of assist. After classifying occlusions according to Paw pattern, expiratory muscle activity was identified in 52%, 67%, and 100% of cases of Paw of passive-like, clear plateau, or irregular rise pattern, respectively. The driving pressure was evaluated in the 133 occlusions having a passive-like or clear plateau pattern in Paw. An increase in gastric pressure was present in 46%, 62%, and 64% of cases at 0.3, 1, and 2 s, respectively, and it was greater than 2 cmH(2)O, in 10%, 20%, and 15% of cases at 0.3, 1, and 2 s, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of Paw during an end-inspiratory occlusion in pressure support cannot assure the absence of expiratory muscle activity and accurate measurement of driving pressure. Yet, because driving pressure can only be overestimated due to expiratory muscle contraction, in everyday practice, a low driving pressure indicates an absence of global lung over-stretch. A measurement of high driving pressure should prompt further diagnostic workup, such as a measurement of esophageal pressure.","Soundoulounaki, Stella; Akoumianaki, Evangelia; Kondili, Eumorfia; Pediaditis, Emmanouil; Prinianakis, Georgios; Vaporidi, Katerina; Georgopoulos, Dimitris",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7385937/,453
37598,Im Spannungsfeld zwischen Sicherheit und Freiheit: Eine Analyse zur Akzeptanz der Corona-Warn-App,2020-08-06,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer claims 311,000 lives annually, and 90% of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. Cervical cancer is a highly preventable and treatable disease, if detected through screening at an early stage. Governments have a responsibility to screen women for precancerous cervical lesions. Yet, national screening programmes overlook many poor women and those marginalised in society. Under-screened women (called hard-to-reach) experience a higher incidence of cervical cancer and elevated mortality rates compared to regularly-screened women. Such inequalities deprive hard-to-reach women of the full enjoyment of their right to sexual and reproductive health, as laid out in Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and General Comment No. 22. DISCUSSION: This article argues first for tailored and innovative national cervical cancer screening programmes (NCSP) grounded in human rights law, to close the disparity between women who are afforded screening and those who are not. Second, acknowledging socioeconomic disparities requires governments to adopt and refine universal cancer control through NCSPs aligned with human rights duties, including to reach all eligible women. Commonly reported- and chronically under-addressed- screening disparities relate to the availability of sufficient health facilities and human resources (example from Kenya), the physical accessibility of health services for rural and remote populations (example from Brazil), and the accessibility of information sensitive to cultural, ethnic, and linguistic barriers (example from Ecuador). Third, governments can adopt new technologies to overcome individual and structural barriers to cervical cancer screening. National cervical cancer screening programmes should tailor screening methods to under-screened women, bearing in mind that eliminating systemic discrimination may require committing greater resources to traditionally neglected groups. CONCLUSION: Governments have human rights obligations to refocus screening policies and programmes on women who are disproportionately affected by discrimination that impairs their full enjoyment of the right to sexual and reproductive health. National cervical cancer screening programmes that keep the right to health principles (above) central will be able to expand screening among low-income, isolated and other marginalised populations, but also women in general, who, for a variety of reasons, do not visit healthcare providers for regular screenings.","Perehudoff, Katrina; Vermandere, Heleen; Williams, Alex; Bautista-Arredondo, Sergio; De Paepe, Elien; Dias, Sonia; Gama, Ana; Keygnaert, Ines; Longatto-Filho, Adhemar; Ortiz, Jose; Padalko, Elizaveta; Reis, Rui Manuel; Vanderheijden, Nathalie; Vega, Bernardo; Verberckmoes, Bo; Degomme, Olivier",BMC Int Health Hum Rights,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7393343/,453

Their ability of molecular interaction with different proteins, complex formation with metals, and distinct behavior in various ranges of light makes them more appealing and challenging for future scientists. Various novel technologies have been developed for the selective synthesis of perimidines and their conjugated derivatives. These methods extend to the preparation of different bioactive and industrially applicable molecules. This review aims to present the most recent advancements in perimidine synthesis under varied conditions like MW radiation, ultrasound, and grinding using different catalysts such as ionic liquids, acid, metal, and nanocatalyst and also under green environments like catalyst and solvent-free synthesis. The applications of perimidine derivatives in drug discovery, polymer chemistry, photo sensors, dye industries, and catalytic activity in organic synthesis are discussed in this survey. This article is expected to be a systematic, authoritative, and critical review on the chemistry of perimidines that compiles most of the state-of-art innovation in this area.

However, unlike traditional big data systems, these data structures typically reside in shared memory accessed by multiple cores. Although popular, this emerging hybrid paradigm opens the door to possibly detrimental behavior, such as thread contention and bugs related to non-execution and non-determinism. This study explores the use and misuse of a popular streaming API, namely, Java 8 Streams. The focus is on how developers decide whether or not to run these operations sequentially or in parallel and bugs both specific and tangential to this paradigm. Our study involved analyzing 34 Java projects and 5:53 million lines of code, along with 719 manually examined code patches. Various automated, including interprocedural static analysis, and manual methodologies were employed. The results indicate that streams are pervasive, parallelization is not widely used, and performance is a crosscutting concern that accounted for the majority of fixes. We also present coincidences that both confirm and contradict the results of related studies. The study advances our understanding of streams, as well as benefits practitioners, programming language and API designers, tool developers, and educators alike.","Khatchadourian, Raffi; Tang, Yiming; Bagherzadeh, Mehdi; Ray, Baishakhi",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7418129/,453

Due to its implications for and upregulation in a variety of diseases, including inflammatory conditions, fibrotic disorders, and tumor growth, YKL-40 has been considered as a significant therapeutic biomarker. Here, we used a phage display to develop novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting human YKL-40 (hYKL-40). Human synthetic antibody phage display libraries were panned against a recombinant hYKL-40 protein, yielding seven unique Fabs (Antigen-binding fragment), of which two Fabs (H1 and H2) were non-aggregating and thermally stable (75.5 °C and 76.5 °C, respectively) and had high apparent affinities (K(D) = 2.3 nM and 4.0 nM, respectively). Reformatting the Fabs into IgGs (Immunoglobulin Gs) increased their apparent affinities (notably, for H1 and H2, K(D) = 0.5 nM and 0.3 nM, respectively), presumably due to the effects of avidity, with little change to their non-aggregation property. The six anti-hYKL-40 IgGs were analyzed using a trans-well migration assay in vitro, revealing that three clones (H1, H2, and H4) were notably effective in reducing cell migration from both A549 and H460 lung cancer cell lines. The three clones were further analyzed in an in vivo animal test that assessed their anti-cancer activities, demonstrating that the tumor area and the number of tumor nodules were significantly reduced in the lung tissues treated with H1 (IgG).

40969,Ästhetik in Zeiten von Corona,2020-10-21,"INTRODUCTION: Retransplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue has become an established method of restoring autologous hormone production and fertility after radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy for underlying oncological disease in women of reproductive age and has so far led to more than 170 births worldwide. CASE PRESENTATION AND COURSE: In 2013, the 31-year-old patient developed adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix, pT1b1V0L0. In January 2014, an extended hysterectomy with lymph node dissection and bilateral adnexectomy were performed. At the patient’s request, ovarian tissue was cryopreserved 2 days previously. In November 2019, the retransplantation of two ovarian tissue pieces along the brachial fascia of the left forearm was performed, with no recurrence for 5 years under ongoing hormone replacement therapy (HRT). At 1 month following retransplantation, the patient stopped taking HRT, and 3 months later proper function of the retransplanted tissue could be demonstrated by checking gonadotropins and E2 levels. There was a clear swelling in the area of the retransplantation site, and three vital follicles could be visualized during an ultrasound examination in May 2020. CONCLUSION: This is the first successful retransplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue to restore autologous hormone production in a cervical cancer patient in Austria. Based on blood, ultrasound and cytological examinations, not to mention the patient’s personal well-being, functionality of the retransplanted tissue could be demonstrated even at 6 months after the procedure. Finally, the authors would like to highlight the importance of informing and consulting young patients with tumor diseases on the various possibilities of fertility preservation.","Lipovac, Markus; Herzog, Julia; Imhof, Martin",J Gynakol Endokrinol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7556588/,453

41442,Mitteilungen der GÄCD,2020-11-02,"This article, firstly, critically analyses a face-to-face supervision meeting between an undergraduate and a supervisor, exploring how the supervisor handles the twin strategies of fostering autonomy while managing resistance to advice. Conversation analysis is used as both a theory and a method, with a focus on the use of accounts to support or resist advice. The main contribution is the demonstration of how both the supervisor and the student are jointly responsible for the negotiation of advice, which is recycled and calibrated in response to the student’s resistance. The supervisor defuses complaints by normalising them, and moving his student on to practical solutions, often with humour. He lists his student’s achievements as the foundation on which she can assert agency and build the actions he recommends. Supervisor-student relationships are investigated through the lens of the affective dimensions of learning, to explore how caring or empathy may serve to reduce resistance and make advice more palatable. By juxtaposing physically present supervision with digitally mediated encounters, while acknowledging their mutual entanglement, the postdigital debate is furthered. In the context of Covid-19, and rapid decisions by universities to bring in digital platforms to capture student-teacher interactions, the analysis presented is in itself an act of resistance against the technical control systems of the academy and algorithmic capitalism.","West, Marion",Postdigit Sci Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7588590/,453

41589,Digitale Herausforderungen der Corona-Pandemie,2020-11-05,"BACKGROUND: The FIRST-ABC trial comprises of two pragmatic, multicentre, parallel groups, non-inferiority randomised clinical trials designed to evaluate the clinical non-inferiority of first-line use of high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in critically ill children who require non-invasive respiratory support (NRS). OBJECTIVES: To describe the pre-specified statistical and health economic analysis for the FIRST-ABC trial before completion of patient recruitment and data collection. METHODS: The statistical analysis plan was designed by the chief investigators and statisticians. We define the primary and secondary outcomes, summarise methods for data collection and safety monitoring, and present a detailed description of the planned statistical and health economic analysis. RESULTS: The primary clinical outcome is time to liberation from respiratory support. The primary effect estimate will be the adjusted hazard ratio, reported with a 95% confidence interval. As a sensitivity analysis, the primary analysis will be repeated using time to start weaning of NRS. Subgroup analyses will be performed to test for interactions between the effect of allocated treatment group and pre-specified baseline covariates. The health economic analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle and report the mean (95% confidence interval) incremental costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost-effectiveness up to 6 months. All analyses will be performed separately for each of the two trials, and any results will not be combined. CONCLUSION: The FIRST-ABC trial will assess the non-inferiority of HFNC compared to CPAP in two parallel trials with shared infrastructure (step-up RCT and step-down RCT). We have developed a pre-specified statistical and health economics analysis plan for the FIRST-ABC study before trial completion to minimise analytical bias.

41591,DuD Recht,2020-11-05,"This article contrasts specific aspects of indigenous world views and wisdom on the one hand with specific themes in capitalism, colonisation, corporate interests, technology and education, on the other and argues that there is a fundamental clash of values between them. There is no assumption of a homogenous indigenous wisdom and no claim is made about novel insight into capitalism, colonisation, corporate interests and technology and education. The contribution is in tracing lines of thought in all of them and, by juxtaposing them in the context of a contemporary upsurge in digital/online/blended learning with particular attention to the global techno-corporation, to expose a fundamental clash of values that deserves more thorough scrutiny than it is getting. The paper does not present a linear argument, but rather a woven tapestry of themes. The conclusion is that education would be better served by the insights of indigenous wisdom and a more critical and tempered view of capitalism and technology.","Ruth, Damian",NZ J Educ Stud,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7603410/,453
41681,Mitteilungen der DGRh – Veranstaltungen der Rheumaakademie,2020-11-06,"BACKGROUND: Compassion fatigue, unprofessional behavior, and burnout are prompting educators to examine medical students’ affective reactions to workplace experiences. Attributes of both students and learning environments are influenced by their socio-cultural backgrounds. To prevent ‘educational cultural hegemony’, opinion leaders have advocated research in under-represented cultural contexts, of which Asia is a prime example. This study aimed to broaden the discourse of medical education by answering the question: how do students react affectively to workplace experiences in a Chinese cultural context? METHODS: In 2014, the authors recruited five female and seven male Taiwanese clerkship students to make 1–2 audio-diary recordings per week for 12 weeks describing affective experiences, to which they had consciously reacted. The authors analyzed transcripts of these recordings thematically in the original Mandarin and prepared a thick description of their findings, including illustrative extracts. An English-speaking education researcher helped them translate this into English, constantly comparing the interpretation with the original, untranslated data. RESULTS: (Mis) matches between their visions of future professional life and clerkship experiences influenced participants’ affective reactions, thoughts, and behaviors. Participants managed these reactions by drawing on a range of personal and social resources, which influenced the valence, strength, and nature of their reactions. This complex set of interrelationships was influenced by culturally determined values and norms, of which this report provides a thick description. CONCLUSION: To avoid educational cultural hegemony, educators need to understand professional behavior in terms of complex interactions between culturally-specific attributes of individual students and learning environments.

41897,"Der lange Schatten der Hyperinflation: Oder: Die Sicherheitspräferenz der Deutschen und deren Folgen für Staatsfinanzen, Kapitalanlage und Unternehmensfinanzierung",2020-11-10,"CASE REPORT - INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus (SARS-COV-19) typically targets the respiratory tract; however extra-respiratory manifestations such as myositis and myopericarditis may be the only presenting feature. We present a patient with myopericarditis who developed sudden onset muscle weakness. CT thorax showed typical appearance of COVID-19 with an absence of respiratory symptoms. MRI of both thighs revealed diffuse symmetrical myositis. Her clinical and paraclinical abnormalities improved with the aid of steroids. We present our approach to the case and highlight that clinicians should consider myositis as another COVID-19 manifestation when reviewing the differentials. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-year-old female, non-smoker, presented with few days history of central chest pain radiating to her back. This was exacerbated by lying down and inspiration. Associated with mild shortness of breath on exertion. She denied upper respiratory tract symptoms. Her past medical history included hypertension and myopericarditis in 2012 and 2013 requiring pericardiocentesis. In 2017 she presented with post-streptococcal erythema nodosum and reactive arthritis in left ankle. On auscultation her heart sounds were normal, and chest was clear. Initial investigations revealed a mild lymphopenia 0.63, a C-reactive protein of 11mg/L, and a raised troponin 77 and 103 on repeat. D-dimer, Chest x-ray were normal. ECHO showed trivial anterior pericardial effusion, good biventricular function. Treatment included colchicine 500 micrograms four times a day and Ibuprofen 400 mg three times a day. On her second day of admission she developed hypotensive episodes BP 75/49 mm/Hg and mild pyrexia of 37.5 degrees. Her chest pain continued. Electrocardiogram was normal, repeat echocardiogram showed stable 1.40 cm pericardial effusion. CT thorax revealed no dissection or features suggesting pulmonary sarcoidosis but ground-glass opacity changes in keeping with COVID-19. Her COVID-19 swab test came back positive. On the 4th day of admission, she complained of sudden onset of severe pain affecting her thighs, shoulders, and arms, with marked proximal lower limbs and truncal weakness. Because of this, she struggled to mobilise. There was a rapid rise in her creatine kinase from 6.423U/L (day 5) to 32.230 U/L (day 7). ALT increased to 136. MRI showed diffuse myositis with symmetrical appearances involving the anterior, medial, and posterior muscle compartments of both thighs. In view of her previous and current presentation, autoimmune screen and extended myositis immunoblot were sent and were negative. Interestingly, her clinical and paraclinical abnormalities improved dramatically after few days with no steroids initially. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: The identification of extra-pulmonary manifestations neurological, cardiac, and muscular have recently increased as the number of COVID-19 cases grow. This case highlights cardiac and skeletal muscle involvement could perhaps represent early or only manifestation of COVID-19. Cardiac involvement in COVID-19 commonly manifests as acute cardiac injury (8–12%), arrhythmia (8.9–16.7%) and myocarditis. In our case the cardiac MRI demonstrated evidence of myocarditis in the basal inferoseptum and apex. Myalgia and muscle weakness are among the symptoms described by patients affected by COVID-19. Some studies report the prevalence of myalgia to be between 11%-50%. The onset of symptoms and the fact that her symptoms improved rapidly led us to consider a viral myositis as the underlying cause, the viral component being COVID-19. We also considered other potential causes. There are reported cases of colchicine myopathy however this is more common in patients with renal impairment, which was absent in this case. On further examination she did not have other clinical signs or symptoms of connective tissue disease or extra muscular manifestation of autoimmune myositis. Her abnormal ALT may be derived from damaged muscle, and therefore in this context is not necessarily a specific indicator of liver disease. Interestingly abnormal liver function tests have been attributed in 16 - 53% of COVID-19 cases. Little is known about the multiple biologic characteristics of COVID-19 and there are no established clinic serological criteria for COVID-19 related myositis nor useful values/cut offs to exclude cardiac involvement in myositis, further research is therefore warranted. In conclusion, clinicians should be aware of the rare manifestation of COVID-19 and consider this in the differentials. Of course, it is important in the first instant to rule out any serious underlying disease or overlap disorder before attributing symptoms to COVID-19. Case report - Key learning points: 1. Myositis is a rare manifestation of COVID-19 that clinicians should be aware of. 2. Detailed medical history, examination and investigations identifies the most likely underlying cause. 3. In the right clinical context, COVID-19 – 19 testing should be included in baseline tests of patients presenting with myositis.","Siosi, Alexa José Escudero; Ani, Hudaifa Al; Chan, Antoni",Rheumatol Adv Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607325/,453

State and territory governments are responsible for administering education within their jurisdiction and across the sector comprising government (public), Catholic systemic and other independent schooling systems. They collaborate on education policy with the federal government. Over the past two decades the federal government has taken a greater role in funding across the education sector, and as a result of this involvement and the priorities of federal governments of the day, Australia now has one of the highest rates of non-government schooling in the OECD. Funding equity across the sectors has become a prominent issue. Concerns have been compounded by evidence of declining student performance since Australia’s initial participation in PISA in 2000, and the increasing gap between our high achievers and low achievers. This chapter explores Australia’s PISA 2018 results and what they reveal about the impact of socioeconomic level on student achievement. It also considers the role of school funding and the need to direct support to those schools that are attempting to educate the greater proportion of an increasingly diverse student population including students facing multiple layers of disadvantage.","Thomson, Sue",Improving a Country&#x02019;s Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7682587/,453

Therefore, it is crucial to determine their state, partitioning behaviour and tendencies in water environments. In this study, Bisphenol A was investigated in both colloidal and soluble phases in water. BPA concentrations ranged between 1.13 and 5.52 ng L(−1) in the soluble phase and n.d-2.06 ng L(−1) in the colloidal phase, respectively. BPA was dominant in the soluble phase, however, the colloidal contribution ranged between 0 and 24% which implied that colloids can play a significant role in controlling BPA’s transportation in water. Urban and industrial areas were the main sources of BPA while forest areas displayed lower levels outside the populated domains. pH levels were between 6.3 and 7.4 which might have affected BPA’s solubility in water to some extent. The particle size distribution showed that the majority of the particles in river samples were smaller than 1.8 µm in diameter with a small presence of nanoparticles. Zeta potential varied between − 25 and − 18 mV, and these negative values suggested instability of particles. Furthermore, BPA was positively correlated with BOD, COD and NH(3)–N which might indicate that these organic compounds were released concurrently with BPA. RQ assessment showed low levels of risk towards algae and fish in the study area.","Shehab, Zakariya Nafi’; Jamil, Nor Rohaizah; Aris, Ahmad Zaharin",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7683680/,453

This study was conducted to identify and evaluate the volume, nature, and severity of spectator medical care in the stadiums of 12 venues across Japan during RWC 2019. METHOD: This was a retrospective review of medical records from spectator medical rooms of 45 official matches of RWC 2019 between September 20 and November 2, 2019. All patients in the stadium who visited the spectator medical room and were transferred to a hospital were included. The wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) value at the kick-off time of each match, the number of visits to the spectator medical room, and the number of transfers to a hospital were reviewed and analyzed. The patient presentation rate (PPR) was calculated per 10,000 attendees. Severity categories were defined as mild or severe. Mild cases were considered non-life threatening requiring minimal medical intervention, and severe cases required transport to a hospital. RESULT: The total number of visits to the spectator medical room was 449 with a PPR of 2.63. Most cases (91.5%) were mild in severity. The PPR was significantly higher for the matches held with a WBGT over 25 °C than for the matches under 21 °C (PPR 4.27 vs 2.04, p = 0.04). Thirty-eight cases were transferred to a hospital by ambulance; the PPR was 0.22. The most common reasons for transfer to the hospital were heat illness and fracture/dislocation, at a rate of 15.8% each. The incidence rate of cardiopulmonary arrest per 10,000 attendees was 0.0059 during RWC 2019. CONCLUSION: Preparation and provision of appropriate medical service for spectators is a key factor for mass-gathering events. During RWC 2019, the majority (91.5%) of patients who sought medical attention did so for minor complaints, which were easily assessed and managed. On the other hand, a higher WBGT situation contributes significantly to an increased PPR (< 21 versus > 25, 2.04 versus 4.27, p = 0.04). Careful medical preparation, management, and development of public education programs for higher WBGT situations will be required in the future for similar international mega sports events.","Tajima, Takuya; Takazawa, Yuji; Yamada, Mutsuo; Moriya, Takuro; Sato, Haruhiko; Higashihara, Junichiro; Toyama, Yukimasa; Chosa, Etsuo; Nakamura, Akihiko; Kono, Ichiro",Environ Health Prev Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7684143/,453
42837,Kontrolle und Überwachung von Beschäftigten,2020-12-07,"In a number of works, James M. Buchanan set out a proposal for a ‘demogrant’—a form of universal basic income that applied the principles of generality and non discrimination to the tax and the transfer sides of the scheme and was to be implemented as a constitutional rule outside the realm of day-to-day politics. The demogrant has received surprisingly little scholarly attention, but this article locates it in Buchanan’s broader constitutional political economy project and shows it was a logical application of his theoretical framework to the problem of inefficient and unfair welfare systems when reform to the basic institutions of majoritarian democracy was not forthcoming. The demogrant aims to end the problems of majority cycling and rent seeking that plague contemporary welfare states and therefore offers a model of welfare without rent seeking—a constitutional welfare state. We compare Buchanan’s demogrant model to other universal basic income and negative income tax models and consider the most important criticisms. We conclude that rescuing the demogrant model from relative obscurity would be a fruitful future task of applied constitutional political economy and public choice.","Lehto, Otto; Meadowcroft, John",Const Polit Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7700108/,453

Therefore, the study aimed to assess the community’s perception of COVID-19 and its associated factors in Gondar town, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was employed among 635 Gondar administrative town residents, from April 20 to April 27, 2020. Study participants were selected using a cluster sampling technique. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. Epi-Data version 4.6 and STATA 14 were used for data entry and analysis, respectively. Logistic regressions (bivariable and multivariable) were performed to identify statistically significant variables at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Of the 635 study participants, 623 have completed the study with a 98.1% response rate. The mean age of participants was 36.32 years (SD ± 13.24). The overall magnitude of the community’s misconception about COVID-19 stood at 56.9% (349). Age and religion showed a negative association with misconceptions. To be specific, being in the age group of 27–33 (AOR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.32, 0.86) and being a Muslim (AOR 0.51, 95% CI 0.34, 0.78) were negatively associated with the misconception of COVID-19, whereas occupation and awareness showed positive associations with the misconception. To be specific, having an unemployed occupational status (AOR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.14, 2.82) and being unaware of the number of cases of COVID-19 (AOR 1.66, 95% CI 1.05, 2.62) were positively associated with the community’s misconception on COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The magnitude of the community’s misconception about COVID-19 among Gondar town residents was high. Age, religion, unemployment, and unawareness about the number of COVID-19 cases were significant factors of misconception about COVID-19. Thus, stakeholders ought to build community perceptions about COVID 19. To resolve misinformation about COVID-19, accurate and relevant information should be provided to the community using appropriate communication media.","Mekonnen, Habtamu Sewunet; Azagew, Abere Woretaw; Wubneh, Chalachew Adugna; Belay, Getaneh Mulualem; Assimamaw, Nega Tezera; Agegnehu, Chilot Desta; Azale, Telake; Azene, Zelalem Nigussie; Merid, Mehari Woldemariam; Muluneh, Atalay Goshu; Geberu, Demiss Mulatu; Kassa, Getahun Molla; Yenit, Melaku Kindie; Tilahun, Sewbesew Yitayih; Gelaye, Kassahun Alemu; Tamiru, Animut Tagele; Rade, Bayew Kelkay; Taye, Eden Bishaw; Taddese, Asefa Adimasu; Andualem, Zewudu; Dagne, Henok; Gashaye, Kiros Terefe; Kabito, Gebisa Guyasa; Mekonnen, Tesfaye Hambisa; Wami, Sintayehu Daba; Azanaw, Jember; Adane, Tsegaye; Alemayehu, Mekuriaw",Trop Med Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7719437/,453
43120,Wenn Corona die Praxis schließt,2020-12-17,"INTRODUCTION: There are increasing reports of a pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that presents with varying clinical features, but includes features of Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome. Symptoms include fever, rash, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Many patients present without any respiratory symptoms and testing for SARS-CoV-2 is often negative. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed. RESULTS: A 7-year-old previously healthy male presented with 3 days of fevers up to 102.4F, headaches, abdominal pain, and intractable vomiting. Both parents had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 four weeks prior. Nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Echocardiogram was normal. CT venogram of his head was negative for any pathology. He developed severe neck pain and persistent headache during his hospitalization. Soon after receiving hydroxychloroquine, he developed a facial rash and altered mental status with episodes of aphasia, agitation, and pinpoint pupils. He then became unresponsive with left gaze deviation. A non-contrast head CT and CT angiography were negative. He was given levetiracetam and cefazolin and transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed no epileptiform activity. Over the following 7 hours, the EEG demonstrated left frontotemporal slowing, which progressed into a loss of fast activity over the right hemisphere with increased delta activity in the left hemisphere, then abruptly changed to generalized voltage attenuation.He rapidly lost brainstem reflexes, developing fixed and dilated pupils. Repeat CT scan revealed diffuse cerebral edema with loss of gray-white differentiation. Lab results then were consistent with severe inflammation. An intracranial pressure monitor revealed pressures greater than 76 mmHg. His exam soon became consistent with brain death. Pathologic evaluation showed diffuse cerebral edema with perivascular mononuclear infiltrates. CONCLUSION: The cause of this pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome is unclear and the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the nervous system is unknown. Pediatric patients with COVID-19 and neurologic symptoms should be closely monitored as they can rapidly decline due to fulminant cerebral edema.","Kim, Michael; Stein, Alan A; Overby, Philip; Kleinman, George; Nuoman, Rolla; Al-Mufti, Fawaz; Pisapia, Jared M; Muh, Carrie R",Neurosurgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7717353/,453

However, social distancing policies and restrictions on public activities have been implemented since the outbreak of COVID-19 at the beginning of 2020 in Taiwan. These restrictions not only prevent older individuals from performing meaningful activities but also have actual impacts on their daily life. This study aims to elucidate the intervening role of meanings of life activities on the relationship between functional status and COVID-19 disruptions. Data were collected from a sample of 526 community-dwelling older adults with disabilities in Taiwan between April and July, 2020. Utilizing Multiple Regression Analysis, the research findings were as follows. First, participants with better functional status experienced more COVID-19 related disruptions to their daily routine. In the meantime, they also valued their life activities as more meaningful than those with worse functional status. Second, higher levels of meanings in performing life activities also positively related to COVID-19 disruptions. Third, meanings of life activities fully mediated the relationship between functional status and COVID-19 disruptions. That is, disabled older individuals with better functional status may experience more COVID-19 related disruptions because their accessibility to meaningful activities was limited. Since preventive approaches to control the spread are necessary during COVID-19 epidemic, efforts should be made to sustain meaningful life activities participation among disabled older adults. Based on the findings of this study, this would be especially critical to the well-being of more capable older individuals with disabilities during the pandemic.","Yu, Meng-Hsuan; Chao, Shiau-Fang",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7740368/,453

Given mobility issues arising from health concerns, economic status changes, loss of friends and partners, older people are at a higher risk for social isolation and loneliness. Since the declaration of national emergency for COVID-19 on March 13, 2020, many older adults have not been able to connect with others in traditional ways. Instead, activities and contacts have been facilitated virtually via videoconferencing or phone calls to maintain physical and social distance. Amidst COVID-19, the transition to using technologies to connect socially and reduce loneliness has been a critical factor in preventing social isolation and loneliness. Identifying effective strategies involving the use of technology, designing new ways to deliver services virtually, and developing educational programs to promote technology is vitally necessary. This systematic review explored the relationship between technology use and social isolation or loneliness, and examined interventions that reduced social isolation in older adults. A unified strategy was used to systematically search seven databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and AgeLine) to examine qualitative and quantitative studies published in English between 2010 and 2020. Preliminary results indicate that technology can alleviate social isolation and loneliness in older adults despite some mixed results. The findings of this study will provide a foundation for policymakers and practitioners to shape policies and design programs that help older adults to alleviate social isolation and loneliness, particularly amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kim, Yoon Chung; Kohn, Gail; Davis, Carenado; Saunders, Pamela",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7743308/,453

This paper uses a netnographic approach to explore travel-related Pinterest data. From a methodological perspective, it finds that the platform is suitable for informing ongoing travel information search research but points to potential methodological challenges.

45674,Syphilis 2021 - die Infektionszahlen steigen stetig,2021-02-18,"Coworking spaces (CWS) are open creative labs that provide a community-like environment and the necessary surroundings for their users to build and maintain networks with different actors inside and outside the CWS. With a wide variety of knowledge and skills available in trusted surroundings as well as similar value orientations, coworkers enjoy favorable conditions to establish their network-style. However, research has not investigated the benefit of coworkers’ social networks as far as their individual creativity is concerned so far. This paper takes several network characteristics into account: structure in terms of network size and centrality in the CWS, but also trusted and reciprocal relationships, supportiveness, diversity of knowledge exchanged, and the individual openness to core coworking values. Based on the literature on social networks and small group research, we developed a research model. We tested it to get deeper insights into the phenomenon by relying on 113 coworkers in 33 private German coworking spaces. The results show that a central position in the CWS allowing for direct exchange and high individual openness to core coworking values positively affects social involvement and the diversity of knowledge exchanged, and finally, a coworker’s individual creativity. Managerial implications include the vital role of a central position in the CWS for creativity and a somewhat balanced composition of coworkers working alone or in a team.","Rese, Alexandra; Görmar, Lars; Herbig, Alena",Rev Manag Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7868670/,453

CT chest has become an essential diagnostic investigation and as a prognostic tool for assessment for COVID-19 bronchopneumonia. This case report is about an incidental unexpected finding in a young female, who underwent CT chest screening with suspicion of COVID-19 bronchopneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 29-year-old female came with the complaints of sore throat, myalgia, and fever for the past 3 days. She was referred to our department for plain screening CT chest to rule out COVID 19 infection. She was an active sports person since childhood. CT chest revealed a large well-defined bullous cystic lesion of size 16 × 9.5 × 9.5 cm in the left lung lower lobe with partial sparing of its superior, anterior, and posterior basal segments. Imaging diagnosis of large bullous cystic lesion with emphysematous changes was made. No features of COVID 19 bronchopneumonia. Thoracoscopy-guided lobectomy was done, and tissue was sent to histopathological examination. Final diagnosis was large type 1 congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation with mucinous metaplasia. Our case is unique in the sense that large adult CCAM with mucinous metaplasia of the epithelium is a rare presentation. Further it was diagnosed as a part of COVID 19 screening. CONCLUSION: CCAM presentation in adult is rare. Asymptomatic CCAM lesion of this size diagnosed during COVID 19 chest CT screening was rarely described.","Kathar Hussain, Mohamed rafi; Kulasekeran, N.; Anand, A.

Seken, usually translated as ‘social appearance or appearance in the eyes of others,’ is a deep undercurrent woven into the fabric of Japanese life. It has led to providers who become ill with the SARS-CoV-2 virus feeling ashamed, while concealing their conditions from coworkers and public health officials. It also has led to healthcare providers being perceived as polluted and their children being told they were not welcome in schools. Although such experiences are not isolated to Japan and have appeared in other parts of the world, the cultural forces driving them in Japan are unique.

METHODS: Vero cells were incubated with different concentrations of herbal extracts and infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 48 hours. The inhibition of viral replication was assessed by determination of the viral RNA load in the cell culture supernatant using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was reduced by non-cytotoxic concentrations of BRO-TP (up to approximately 1,000-fold) and, to a lesser extent, IMU and TOP (approximately 10-fold). CONCLUSIONS: Some herbal extracts showed a promising in vitro effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2, suggesting an antiviral potential of herbal medicinal products. The potential of herbal medicines to restrict SARS-CoV-2 and to treat COVID-19 should be investigated further in a clinical setting.","De Pellegrin, Michela Luisa; Rohrhofer, Anette; Schuster, Philipp; Schmidt, Barbara; Peterburs, Philipp; Gessner, André",Clin Phytosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7937545/,453

50019,Die Bedeutung der Gesundheitskommunikation in der Prävention und Gesundheitsförderung,2020-12-18,"This chapter presents the background and motivation for why this book came about. Needless to say, this book has two key words besides “sociophysics,” and these are “evolutionary game” and “mathematical epidemiology.” Game theory is a contemporary mathematical concept founded in the middle of the twentieth century by the milestone work of John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern; “Theory of Games and Economic Behavior” (Princeton University Press, 1944). Following their work, John Nash played an important role in applying the theory to various domains, including economics, information science, and biology; for his efforts, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1994 due to his establishment of the concept of Nash Equilibrium. Briefly, game theory can be described as a mathematical template for modeling human decision-making processes. If one intends to address the time-evolutionary aspect of a dynamical system, this is called evolutionary game theory (EGT), as distinct from classic game theory, which focuses on a static situation in which several game players with several strategies mutually interact to maximize their benefits (called a “payoff”) at a certain moment. After the concept of complex science emerged in the 1990s and computational resources surged, EGT was combined with multi-agent simulation (MAS) to open up a new horizon through which it is possible to approach many complex problems related to human social systems that contain physical systems as subordinates. Such problems had previously been considered unsolvable because human behavior was seen as too stochastic to appropriately predict the dynamics of decision-making. A disease spreading in our society is a good example. Epidemiology—meaning the study of how an epidemic spreads on a human network—can be said to be sufficiently predictable because we know that it obeys a simple physics: the principle of diffusion phenomena. But the behavior of each individual is so varied, so prone to stochastic deviation, and so significantly influenced by information from the media that it is hard to predict how a disease will really spread through a complex human social system. In fact, whether one commits to pre-emptive vaccination or not is deeply related to the costs of the illness and the vaccination, and is also significantly influenced by the extent of the current outbreak as it stochastically evolves in time. This is quite a difficult task: but this book aims to address it in the following chapters.","Tanimoto, Jun",Sociophysics Approach to Epidemics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7982977/,453

51049,NACHRICHTEN: Meldungen aus Verbänden und Gesundheitspolitik,2021-04-13,"INTRODUCTION: Healthcare workers are particularly susceptible to developing COVID-19 owing to close and frequent contact with COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to describe prevalence of SARS-COV-2 antibodies amongst healthcare workers within a hospital trust and examine factors associated with increased prevalence of this antibody. METHODS: Data was obtained over a 4-week period in 2020 from a cross-sectional prospective survey of healthcare workers serving a multi-ethnic inner-city population who had IgG SARS-COV-2 antibody. Multiple, overlapping sources of notification were implemented to promote the availability of the test. Anonymised socio-demographic data about staff members were cross referenced with data of the antibody tests. RESULTS: Of 7,013,6,212 (89%) staff undertook the antibody test during the study period. The overall detection rate of IgG SARS COV-2 antibody was 26%(1584/6212). Univariate analyses reveal that there were no differences in the prevalence rates in terms of gender or age. Compared to white staff members (18%), prevalence of the antibody was significantly greater in Black(38%) and Asian(27%) staff members. The combined prevalence for all BAME staff members was 32%. The prevalence rates of staff in general wards (43%) were significantly higher other areas of the trust. For staff in emergency medicine, intensive care and anaesthetics, prevalence was 23%, whereas for other clinical teams it was 21%. In terms of professional groups, prevalence rates were highest amongst nursing and allied clinical services (28%), followed by doctors (23%), whereas, it was lower for non-clinical staff(19%). DISCUSSION: This large multi-ethnic hospital-based study has described the prevalence of recent exposure to SARS-COV-2 infection amongst healthcare workers and determined socio-demographic associations of this prevalence including ethnicity, professional healthcare groups, and geographical areas of work in healthcare settings. The study provides information that may be useful in future COVID studies examining the role of antibody testing both in general populations as well as in healthcare settings.","Patel, M; Nair, M; Pirozzoli, E; Cienfuegos, M C; Aitken, E",Age Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989648/,453

However, little is known about the impact of undertaking online collaborative learning (OCL) on student teachers’ views about the process and about their own teaching and learning. This qualitative study examined 18 student teachers’ views about their experience of OCL and the way it affected them as learners and future teachers. The participants reported that OCL helped them develop varied views of learning and had a positive effect on their views about the future use of OCL. They saw their personal experience of OCL as an important aspect of their development as teachers. These findings highlight ways that online learning can shape the views and professionalism of student teachers. Future teacher training programs can provide OCL as a teaching experience at an early stage to help transform student teachers’ self-understanding from that of a student to that of a teacher. The findings of this study further reveal that online collaborative teacher training offers student teachers an opportunity to collaborate, discuss, and reflect on their professional development as teachers. This encourages teacher educators to reconsider how new forms of practice and teaching theories can be woven together more effectively in post-COVID teacher training.","Lei, Man; Medwell, Jane",Asia Pacific Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8043438/,453

The clinical presentation is variable, including a variety of neuropsychiatric related symptoms. Myxedema Madness is a rare and severe neuropsychiatric complication of hypothyroidism manifested as psychosis. Case Presentation: A 25-year-old female with past medical history significant for treated Papillary Thyroid Cancer, presented with near syncopal event associated with weakness, lower extremity swelling, constipation, cold intolerance and dry skin. The patient was not compliant with her thyroid replacement therapy. Upon collateral history taken from the patient’s mother; the patient became dysphoric and tearful. On examination, patient had slightly decreased blood pressure and non-pitting edema on lower extremities. On neurological evaluation she exhibited forgetfulness and retardation of speech and motoric activity. Lab was remarkable for TSH greater than 100 uU/mL (reference range 0.30-4.20 uU/mL), FT4 0.4 ng/dL (reference range 0.6-1.5 ng/dL), and FT3 0.7 pg/mL (reference range 2.3-4.2 pg/mL). Patient tested negative for COVID-19 PCR. She was started on her home dose of Levothyroxine 150 mcg daily. Patient was discharged home after she was assessed by a psychiatrist, with no further interventions. Three days later, the patient was readmitted for confusion, disorientation and memory loss. Patient was found to be positive for COVID-19 PCR and negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. She was found to be disoriented with paranoid delusions. Laboratory studies showed negative urine drug screen, syphilis and NMDA antibodies. CSF analysis were within normal ranges. Brain Magnetic resonance imaging was only positive for pituitary hyperplasia. Patient was started on T4 and T3 replacement therapy (Levothyroxine 50 mcq Intravenous, Liothyronine 5 mcg daily orally, respectively) followed by Risperdal 1 mg nightly. After significant improvement in her mood and delusions, patient was discharged home on Levothyroxine 150 mg daily and Risperdal 1mg for two weeks. Patient and family members were counseled on medications compliance. In a two-week follow-up visit, patient reported to be compliant with medications and improvement of mood. She denied hallucination or delusions. Her lab work was significant for TSH 5.57 uU/mL, FT4 1.3 ng/dL and FT3 3.2 pg/mL. Conclusion: Both psychosis secondary to COVID-19 and Myxedema Madness are rare conditions. Appropriate and timely supplementation of thyroid hormone facilitated speedy return of patient’s cognitive and psychiatric functions to appropriate baseline. This case report may increase physician’s awareness for potentially increased susceptibility of patients with severe hypothyroidism to neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19.","Tal, Noa; Veriker, Robbie; Averbukh, Yelena",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8089490/,453
52523,Künstliche Intelligenz in der Medizin und Gynäkologie – Holzweg oder Heilversprechen?,2021-05-06,"The placenta is the primary organ responsible for deactivating maternal glucocorticoids and reducing fetal exposure. Glucocorticoid use during pregnancy is a common treatment for asthma, allergies, and COVID-19. Several studies have reported adverse effects including intrauterine growth restriction as a result of glucocorticoid exposure, yet little is known about the mechanisms by which short and long-term maternal glucocorticoid exposures affect placental biology and fetal development. To better understand the role of glucocorticoids on placental and fetal outcomes, we used a mouse model exposed to the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (Dex), prior to and throughout gestation. We conducted a randomized controlled trial in mice with a treatment arm of Dex exposure and water exposure as control. Virgin C57Bl/6J female mice were single-housed at 11 weeks of age, and Dex was introduced in the drinking water as a 1mg/kg/day dose. After one week of treatment, mice were bred with age-matched virgin males. Dam body composition, food, and water intake were monitored weekly. Maternal insulin sensitivity, pup survival rate, litter size, and pup birth weight at postnatal day (PND) 0.5 were also assessed. Dams treated with Dex lost significant lean mass after one week of treatment. Dex treatment did not appear to affect the dams’ ability to get pregnant, as both groups carried pups to term with similar lengths of gestation (p=0.838). Water and Dex-treated dams gained comparable weight during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy, however, the Dex group gained less lean mass than the water group during the third trimester. At PND0.5, Dex dams had fewer pups with a 40% reduction in litter size (p=0.01) and lighter pups with a 37% reduction in offspring weight (p<0.001), indicating substantial intrauterine growth restriction. All pups of Dex-treated dams died by PND1. Attempts to rescue pups of Dex-dams by cross-fostering with water-treated nursing dams or by feeding the pups 10% glucose at PND0.5 failed by PND1. These results demonstrate a novel finding regarding the chronic use of glucocorticoids before and during conception and pregnancy. The reduction in both pup weight and late-pregnancy maternal weight gain suggests potential growth restriction or placental insufficiency. Further molecular studies during multiple time points of gestation will help elucidate the mechanisms at play.","El Habbal, Noura; Mulcahy, Molly C; Redd, JeAnna R; Bridges, Dave",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8089805/,453

Jahrestagung der VSOU digital",2021-06-11,"Several empirical studies of reductions in air pollutants as social distancing and working from home (WFH) policies have sparked recommendations that the COVID-19 pandemic might have been responsible for better air quality particularly in urban area. These findings offer a compelling provocation for the scientific community to detect and investigate variations to air quality as a consequence of government enforced quarantine. In spite of countless research studies focusing on the connection between WFH policy and air pollutant levels, the majority of discussion has unfortunately ignored the central role of other potential sources (e.g. agricultural waste burnings, cooking emissions, and industrial releases) in governing air quality, or has neglected the psychological and social impacts of COVID-19. In this study, a t test was used to compare the average concentrations of PM(2.5) and COVID-19-infected numbers (n) in three different periods which were n < 300 vs. n ≧ 300, n < 500 vs. n ≧ 500, and n < 700 vs. n ≧ 700. Some significant differences were observed in the groups of n < 500 vs. n ≧ 500, and n < 700 vs. n ≧ 700 indicating that the psychological and social impacts play a crucial role in restricting daily activities and thus reducing the atmospheric contents of PM(2.5) in some areas. Further assessments were conducted by separating PM(2.5) contents into three different periods (i.e. Period-I: day-1 ~ day-10; Period-II: day-11 ~ day-20; Period-III: day-21 ~ day-31). Some significant reductions of PM(2.5) during the Period-I were detected in the eastern area of Bangkok. In addition, Pearson correlation analysis showed that hot-spot numbers appear to be a minor of importance in controlling PM(2.5) levels in the ambient air of Bangkok, Thailand.","Pongpiachan, Siwatt; Chetiyanukornkul, Thaneeya; Manassanitwong, Wirat",Aerosol Sci Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8155651/,453
53876,C﻿hief digital officers: the state of the art and the road ahead,2021-06-07,"Permanently frozen environments (glaciers, permafrost) are considered as natural reservoirs of huge amounts of microorganisms, mostly dormant, including human pathogens. Due to global warming, which increases the rate of ice-melting, approximately 4 × 10(21) of these microorganisms are released annually from their frozen confinement and enter natural ecosystems, in close proximity to human settlements. Some years ago, the hypothesis was put forward that this massive release of potentially-pathogenic microbes—many of which disappeared from the face of the Earth thousands and even millions of years ago—could give rise to epidemics. The recent anthrax outbreaks that occurred in Siberia, and the presence of bacterial and viral pathogens in glaciers worldwide, seem to confirm this hypothesis. In that context, the present review summarizes the currently available scientific evidence that allows us to imagine a near future in which epidemic outbreaks, similar to the abovementioned, could occur as a consequence of the resurrection and release of microbes from glaciers and permafrost.

Literature on the key areas of (1) early childhood, (2) story and (3) religious education were analysed to understand their unique perspectives and ways they overlap and connect, with an emphasis on seeking literature which connected all three areas. The study revealed the areas of religious education, the use of story and the field of early childhood as three distinct areas of research with connection points, and gaps in the literature connecting the pedagogical use of story for religious education in early primary education. The literature identifies the use of story as effectively engaging and connecting children to religious education in a pedagogically appropriate way for the early childhood age group. Further to this, benefits were found not only in faith development and biblical literacy, but also in learning, literacy development, empathy, and engagement with differing worldviews. The Australian context was a focus of the literature review providing insight for religious education in Christian schools which may be applied to other contexts in public schools, or internationally.","Huth, Kerrin; Brown, Raymond; Usher, Wayne",j,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8206901/,453
54695,Report,2021-06-21,"The aim of this study is to analyze, evaluate and validate the NSE (National Student Enquiry) as a service quality measure helping both higher education institutions (HEIs) and students in their decision making. Every year the Dutch foundation ‘Studiekeuze123’ sends out a survey (the NSE) to collect data on service quality regarding education at HEIs in the Netherlands. We used the 2019 NSE-data from the only e-learning university in the Netherlands, the Open Universiteit (OUNL), containing a sample of 1287 students. PLS-SEM was used to analyze a conceptual model in order to understand the service quality factors that promote students’ level of satisfaction and willingness to recommend the HEI. Overall, the findings reveal that the quality of the NSE is sufficient to be used for performance analysis. Nine out of twelve service components taken into account for the OUNL are found statistically significant affecting students’ satisfaction and willingness to recommend. The results help HEIs promoting and managing students’ perceptions of the quality of education and support students in their decision making process. Since many HEIs had to make a transition from onsite to online education within a short period of time, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, service quality became a major concern for HEIs. As online learning systems are expected to stay, analyzing the service quality of the OUNL as a reputed online HEI can help other HEIs getting their online learning systems on track.","Schijns, Jos M.

Our studies demonstrated that T. gondii developed mechanisms to evade of the host immune response, such as cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) induction, and these mediators can be produced/stored in lipid droplets (LDs). The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of COX-2 and LDs during T. gondii infection in human trophoblast cells and villous explants. Our data demonstrated that COX-2 inhibitors decreased T. gondii replication in trophoblast cells and villous. In BeWo cells, the COX-2 inhibitors induced an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and MIF), and a decrease in anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10). In HTR-8/SVneo cells, the COX-2 inhibitors induced an increase of IL-6 and nitrite and decreased IL-4 and TGF-β1. In villous explants, the COX-2 inhibitors increased MIF and decreased TNF-α and IL-10. Furthermore, T. gondii induced an increase in LDs in BeWo and HTR-8/SVneo, but COX-2 inhibitors reduced LDs in both cells type. We highlighted that COX-2 is a key factor to T. gondii proliferation in human trophoblast cells, since its inhibition induced a pro-inflammatory response capable of controlling parasitism and leading to a decrease in the availability of LDs, which are essentials for parasite growth.","de Souza, Guilherme; Silva, Rafaela José; Milián, Iliana Claudia Balga; Rosini, Alessandra Monteiro; de Araújo, Thádia Evelyn; Teixeira, Samuel Cota; Oliveira, Mário Cézar; Franco, Priscila Silva; da Silva, Claudio Vieira; Mineo, José Roberto; Silva, Neide Maria; Ferro, Eloisa Amália Vieira; Barbosa, Bellisa Freitas",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8209052/,453

The widespread geographic distribution of the disease and the increase in the incidence of the disease from new regions, placed CCHF in a list of public health emergency contexts. The rapid diagnosis, in rural and remote areas where the majority of cases occur, is essential for patient management. Aptamers are considered as a specific and sensitive tool for being used in rapid diagnostic methods. The Nucleoprotein (NP) of the CCHF virus (CCHFV) was selected as the target for the isolation of aptamers based on its abundance and conservative structure, among other viral proteins. A total of 120 aptamers were obtained through 9 rounds of SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment) from the ssDNA aptamer library, including the random 40-nucleotide ssDNA region between primer binding sites (GCCTGTTGTGAGCCTCCTAAC(N(40))GGGAGACAAGAATAAGCA). The K(D) of aptamers was calculated using the SPR technique. The Apt33 with the highest affinity to NP was selected to design the aptamer-antibody ELASA test. It successfully detected CCHF NP in the concentration of 90 ng/ml in human serum. Evaluation of aptamer-antibody ELASA with clinical samples showed 100% specificity and sensitivity of the test. This simple, specific, and the sensitive assay can be used as a rapid and early diagnosis tool, as well as the use of this aptamer in point of care test near the patient. Our results suggest that the discovered aptamer can be used in various aptamer-based rapid diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of CCHF virus infection.","Jalali, Tahmineh; Salehi-Vaziri, Mostafa; Pouriayevali, Mohammad Hassan; Gargari, Seyed Latif Mousavi",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8209218/,453

At face value, this would suggest a higher vulnerability for cyber threats. This research note analyses how a global financial institution dealt with this challenge by using Hollnagel's four abilities for resilient performance as a theoretical lens. Semi‐structured in‐depth interviews with eleven key actors were conducted. Three findings stand out. First, the interviews suggest that the organization performed cyber resiliently in the sense that the number of incidents and impact were not significantly higher. Second, the interviews show that all four abilities of resilience were formally developed prior to the COVID‐19 outbreak, but rarely resulted in anticipatory adjustment. Third, the interviews indicate that the ability to respond contributed most to the organization's cyber resilience during the pandemic crisis.

55281,Gesundheitskompetenz im Zeitalter der Digitalisierung: Wo stehen wir?,2021-07-01,"The angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an established receptor and entry point for the novel SARS‐CoV‐2 coronavirus, as the spike protein on the viral envelope binds the ACE2 receptor. Published histological profiling revealed ACE2 to be highly expressed on human lung alveolar epithelial cells and on enterocytes of the small intestine, as well as on arterial and venous endothelial cells. Given the widespread abundance of ACE2 across tissues, there has been much speculation regarding whether ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and/or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB) might alter tissue ACE2 expression and thereby change the risk of transmission or development of severe complications. Therefore, the aim of this ongoing study is to measure the impact of ACEi and ARB singly and in combination versus placebo control on tissue distribution of ACE2 in male and female mice. A factorial design was employed with the following exposures: ACEi (lisinopril, 10 mg/kg/day), ARB (losartan, 10 mg/kg/day), both drugs, or water control. Drugs were delivered via drinking water. C57BL/6J Mice were 8 weeks of age at the start of the experiment. After 21 days of treatment, four mice (two males and two females) from each treatment group were euthanized, followed by perfusion and tissue collection. 12 more untreated mice were combined with the placebo group to increase the sample size of this reference group to 16 (8 males, 8 females). ACE2 protein abundance in brain, kidney, liver, lung, and small intestine was measured by ELISA (Abcam) and normalized to BCA‐measured total protein. Two‐way ANOVA was performed to test for differences in ACE2 levels by organ or sex among untreated mice; Mann‐Whitney tests were performed to compare each drug treatment group to the control group. Among untreated mice, ACE2 levels differed by organ (p < 0.01), but there were no differences between males and females for a given organ (p = 0.20). Males and females were combined for subsequent analyses. After 21 days of treatment, ACEi, ARB, and the combination therapy lowered ACE2 tissue abundance compared to untreated mice in the brain (ACEi p = 0.04; ARB p = 0.04; ACEi+ARB p = 0.01), kidney (ACEi p = 0.03; ARB p = 0.02; ACEi+ARB p = 0.02), and lung (ACEi p = 0.01; ARB p = 0.01; ACEi+ARB p = 0.01). ACEi, but not ARB or combination therapy, lowered ACE2 tissue abundance in the liver (p = 0.02). None of the treatments changed ACE2 tissue abundance in the small intestine. These results indicate that ACEi, ARB, or combination therapy reduces levels of ACE2, the SARS‐CoV‐2 receptor, in key tissues affected by the virus, including lung, kidney, and brain. An ongoing validation study will evaluate ACE2 protein and gene expression at earlier time points, as well as after discontinuation of treatment. These results will provide valuable insight into the risk or potential benefit of starting or stopping ACEi, ARB, or combination therapy during the COVID‐19 pandemic.","da Silva Moreira, Aline; Brooks, Steven; Smith, Rachel; Moore, Ian; Ackerman, Hans",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239847/,453

Recognition of PAMPs by PRRs initiate innate immune responses via diverse signaling pathways. Over recent decades, advances in our knowledge of innate immune sensing have enhanced our understanding of the host immune response to poxviruses. Multiple PRR families have been implicated in poxvirus detection, mediating the initiation of signaling cascades, activation of transcription factors, and, ultimately, the expression of antiviral effectors. To counteract the host immune defense, poxviruses have evolved a variety of immunomodulators that have diverse strategies to disrupt or circumvent host antiviral responses triggered by PRRs. These interactions influence the outcomes of poxvirus infections. This review focuses on our current knowledge of the roles of PRRs in the recognition of poxviruses, their elicited antiviral effector functions, and how poxviral immunomodulators antagonize PRR-mediated host immune responses.","Yu, Huibin; Bruneau, Ryan C.; Brennan, Greg; Rothenburg, Stefan",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8301327/,453

In contrast, METTL3 silencing or DAA-mediated total methylation inhibition improved the sensitivity of TMZ-resistant GBM cells to TMZ in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that two critical DNA repair genes (MGMT and APNG) were m(6)A-modified by METTL3, whereas inhibited by METTL3 silencing or DAA-mediated total methylation inhibition, which is crucial for METTL3-improved TMZ resistance in GBM cells.

The goal of this study was to compare health-promoting lifestyles and irrational health beliefs in pregnant women with GDM and healthy pregnant women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was a descriptive causal-comparative study in which 100 eligible GDM women and 100 eligible healthy women were selected through available sampling in three referral hospitals in Tehran In 2020. In this study, the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile (HPLP) and the Irrational Health Beliefs Scale (IHBS) were used. Data were analyzed using independent t-test and logistic regression by SPSS 16 software. RESULTS: Findings showed that there is a significant relationship between the variables of IHBS and HPLP. For every one unit increase in an IHBS score, the chance of having diabetes increases by 2.8%. In the case of HPLP, women who exercised well were 7.5% less likely to develop diabetes, and those who took good responsibility were 7.8% less likely to develop diabetes. Furthermore, in independent t-test, the HPLP variable showed a significant difference between the two groups with diabetes and healthy individuals (P < 0.001). Furthermore, in comparing the subscales of this variable, physical activity (P < 0.0001), self-fulfillment (P < 0.004), responsibility (P < 0.003), and stress control (P < 0.001), a significant difference was observed. The results of IHBS research showed a significant difference between the two groups of gestational diabetes and healthy individuals (P < 0.004).

A total of 2504 reasons were gathered across the three subsamples. Most respondents reported multiple reasons, especially when encouraged to list all of their reasons. After distinguishing preconditions from motives to telework, ten categories emerged from the qualitative data with “avoid commute” emerging as the most frequently reported motive. Other frequently reported motives included “tend to family demands” and “productivity.” Additional motives are discussed along with implications for telework research and policy development and implementation.","Thompson, Rebecca J.; Payne, Stephanie C.; Alexander, Allison L.; Gaskins, Vanessa A.; Henning, Jaime B.",Occup Health Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8415699/,453

These cells have been described in both infections and cancer and are known for their immunosuppressive activity. In the case of COVID-19, long-term complications have been frequently observed (long-COVID). In this context, we aimed to investigate the immune response of COVID-19 convalescents after a mild or asymptomatic course of disease. We enrolled 13 convalescents who underwent a mild or asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2, confirmed by a positive result of the PCR test, and 13 healthy donors without SARS-CoV-2 infection in the past. Whole blood was used for T-cell subpopulation and LDNs/PMN-MDSCs analysis. LDNs/PMN-MDSCs and normal density neutrophils (NDNs) were sorted out by FACS and used for T-cell proliferation assay with autologous T cells activated with anti-CD3 mAb. Serum samples were used for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing IgG and GM-CSF concentration. Our results showed that in convalescents, even 3 months after infection, an elevated level of LDNs/PMN-MDSCs is still maintained in the blood, which correlates negatively with the level of CD8(+) and double-negative T cells. Moreover, LDNs/PMN-MDSCs and NDNs showed a tendency for affecting the production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 neutralizing antibodies. Surprisingly, our data showed that in addition to LDNs/PMN-MDSCs, NDNs from convalescents also inhibit proliferation of autologous T cells. Additionally, in the convalescent sera, we detected significantly higher concentrations of GM-CSF, indicating the role of emergency granulopoiesis. We conclude that in mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 convalescents, the neutrophil dysfunction, including propagation of PD-L1-positive LDNs/PMN-MDSCs and NDNs, is responsible for long-term endotype of immunosuppression.","Siemińska, Izabela; Węglarczyk, Kazimierz; Surmiak, Marcin; Kurowska-Baran, Dorota; Sanak, Marek; Siedlar, Maciej; Baran, Jarek",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8511487/,453

Test items were contaminated with viable spores marked with latent prints and then decontaminated using a cobalt 60 gamma irradiator. Fingermark detection was the focus with standard methods including 1,2-indanedione, ninhydrin, diazafluoren-9-one, and physical developer used during this study. DNA recovery using 20% Chelex extraction and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was also explored. Gamma irradiation proved effective as a bacterial decontaminant with D-values ranging from 458 to 500 Gy for nonporous items and 797-808 Gy for porous ones.

77393,Change in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic: shaping plastic surgery services of the future.,2020-05-29,"Peripheral arterial disease, particularly critical limb ischemia, is an area with urgent need for optimized therapies because, to date, vascular interventions often have limited life spans. In spite of initial encouraging technical success after femoropopliteal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or stenting, postprocedural restenosis remains the major problem. The challenging idea behind the drug-coated balloon (DCB) concept is the biological modification of the injury response after balloon dilatation. Antiproliferative drugs administered via DCBs or drug-eluting stents are able to suppress neointimal hyperplasia, the main cause of restenosis. This article reviews the results of DCB treatments of femoropopliteal and infrapopliteal lesions in comparison to standard angioplasty with uncoated balloons. A systematic literature search was performed in 1) medical journals (ie, MEDLINE), 2) international registers for clinical studies (ie, www.clinicaltrials.gov), and 3) abstracts of scientific sessions. Several controlled randomized trials with follow-up periods of up to 5 years demonstrated the efficacy of paclitaxel -DCB technology. However, calcified lesions seem to affect the efficacy of DCB. Combinations of preconditioning methods with DCBs showed promising results. Although the mechanical abrasion of calcium via atherectomy or laser ablation showed favorable periprocedural results, the long-term impact on restenosis and clinical outcome has to be demonstrated. Major advantages of the DCBs are the rapid delivery of drug at uniform concentrations with a single dose, their efficacy in areas wherein stents have been contraindicated until now (ie, bifurcation, ostial lesions), and in leaving no stent scaffold behind. Reinterventions are easier to perform because DCBs leave no metal behind. Various combinations of DCBs with other treatment modalities may prove to be viable options in future. The follow-up results of clinical studies will evaluate the long-term impact of DCBs.","Herten, Monika; Torsello, Giovanni B; Schönefeld, Eva; Stahlhoff, Stefan",Vascular health and risk management,https://doi.org/10.2147/vhrm.s81122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27621646/,453

In this paper, we describe the impact of COVID-19 on nuclear medicine departments in Africa (19 countries, 41 centers) and Latin America (15 countries, 83 centers) obtained from the survey. Respectively in Africa and Latin America, the volume of nuclear medicine procedures decreased by 69% and 79% in June 2020 and 44% and 67% in October 2020. Among the nuclear medicine procedures, oncological PET studies showed less of a decline in utilization compared to conventional nuclear medicine studies. A gradual trend towards a return to the pre-COVID-19 status of the supply chains of radioisotopes, generators, and other essential materials was evident. Overall, in 2020, the pandemic-related challenges resulted in significant decrease in nuclear medicine diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in Africa and Latin America. The impact was more pronounced in Latin America than in Africa. The current COVID-19 pandemic poses many challenges for the practice of nuclear medicine.

However, the underlying causes and the effects of the main anti-hypertensive therapies-angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)-remain unclear. Combining clinical data (n = 144) and single-cell sequencing data of airway samples (n = 48) with in vitro experiments, we observed a distinct inflammatory predisposition of immune cells in patients with hypertension that correlated with critical COVID-19 progression. ACEI treatment was associated with dampened COVID-19-related hyperinflammation and with increased cell intrinsic antiviral responses, whereas ARB treatment related to enhanced epithelial-immune cell interactions. Macrophages and neutrophils of patients with hypertension, in particular under ARB treatment, exhibited higher expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines CCL3 and CCL4 and the chemokine receptor CCR1. Although the limited size of our cohort does not allow us to establish clinical efficacy, our data suggest that the clinical benefits of ACEI treatment in patients with COVID-19 who have hypertension warrant further investigation.","Trump, Saskia; Lukassen, Soeren; Anker, Markus S; Chua, Robert Lorenz; Liebig, Johannes; Thürmann, Loreen; Corman, Victor Max; Binder, Marco; Loske, Jennifer; Klasa, Christina; Krieger, Teresa; Hennig, Bianca P; Messingschlager, Marey; Pott, Fabian; Kazmierski, Julia; Twardziok, Sven; Albrecht, Jan Philipp; Eils, Jürgen; Hadzibegovic, Sara; Lena, Alessia; Heidecker, Bettina; Bürgel, Thore; Steinfeldt, Jakob; Goffinet, Christine; Kurth, Florian; Witzenrath, Martin; Völker, Maria Theresa; Müller, Sarah Dorothea; Liebert, Uwe Gerd; Ishaque, Naveed; Kaderali, Lars; Sander, Leif-Erik; Drosten, Christian; Laudi, Sven; Eils, Roland; Conrad, Christian; Landmesser, Ulf; Lehmann, Irina",Nature biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-00796-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33361824/,453

Eleven healthy adult cats were included. Influence of BG and depth correction on quantitative assessment was evaluated. Depth correction was based on the geometric mean method (using dorsal and ventral images) and the use of two standards placed over each individual kidney. Visual evaluation showed superiority of dorsal and ventral over lateral positioning due to increased separation of the kidneys permitting region of interest (ROI) placement without overlap. No apparent influence of BG correction was found for RU. However, AU was systematically overestimated without BG correction. Depth correction did not seem to affect RU in most cases, however, in some cats the differences were not negligible.

We present a case study of Clarkston, Georgia, the ""most diverse square mile in America,"" where half the population is foreign born and majority refugee. Supporting marginalized communities in times of risk will require a multipronged, systemic approach to health communication including: (1) creating a task force of local leaders and community members to deal with emergent issues; (2) expanding English-language education and support for refugees; (3) including refugee perspectives on risk, health, and wellness into risk communication messaging; (4) improving cultural competence and health literacy training for community leaders and healthcare providers; and (5) supporting community health workers. Finally, better prepared public health programs, including partnerships with trusted community organizations and leadership, can ensure that appropriate and supportive risk communication and health education and promotion are in place long before the next emergency.","Feinberg, Iris Z; Owen-Smith, Ashli; O'Connor, Mary Helen; Ogrodnick, Michelle M; Rothenberg, Richard; Eriksen, Michael P",Health security,https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2021.0048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33961489/,453

However, molecular mechanisms especially epigenetic regulation of mTEC homeostasis and TRA expression remain elusive. Here we show that the H3K27 demethylase Kdm6b is essential to maintain the postnatal thymic medulla by promoting mTEC survival and regulating the expression of TRA genes. Moreover, mice lacking Kdm6b developed pathological autoimmune disorders. Mechanically, Kdm6b exerted its function by reducing repressive H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) at the promoters of anti-apoptotic gene Bcl2 and a set of Aire-dependent TRA genes. Thus, our findings reveal a dual role of Kdm6b in the regulation of mTEC-mediated T cell central tolerance.","Liu, Zhi; Zhang, Haohao; Hu, Yiming; Liu, Dandan; Li, Lingling; Li, Cuifeng; Wang, Qi; Huo, Junhaohui; Liu, Hanshao; Xie, Ningxia; Huang, Xingxu; Liu, Yongzhong; Chen, Charlie Degui; Shi, Yufang; Zhang, Xiaoren",Cell death and differentiation,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41418-020-0546-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346138/,453

To address these uncertainties, this narrative review evaluates human evidence on how altered maternal thyroid function may be associated with child neurodevelopmental outcomes; and seeks to identify parameters in human studies that appear most relevant for toxicological assessments. Serum levels of free thyroxine (fT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) are most frequently measured when assessing thyroid function in pregnant women, whereas a broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental parameters is used to evaluate child neurodevelopment. The human data confirms an association between altered maternal serum fT4 and/or TSH and increased risk for child neurodevelopmental impairment. Quantitative boundaries of effects indicative of increased risks need to be established. Moreover, it is unknown if altered serum levels of total T4, free or total triiodothyronine, or parameters unrelated to serum thyroid hormones might be more relevant indicators of such effects. None of the human studies established a link between substance-mediated liver enzyme induction and increased serum thyroid hormone clearance, let alone further to child neurodevelopmental impairment. This review identifies research needs to contribute to the development of toxicity testing strategies, to reliably predict whether substances have the potential to impair child neurodevelopment via maternal thyroid hormone imbalance.","Sauer, Ursula G; Asiimwe, Alex; Botham, Philip A; Charlton, Alex; Hallmark, Nina; Jacobi, Sylvia; Marty, Sue; Melching-Kollmuss, Stephanie; Palha, Joana A; Strauss, Volker; van Ravenzwaay, Bennard; Swaen, Gerard",Critical reviews in toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1080/10408444.2020.1839380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305658/,453

Carbohydrate binding specificity of BCA was examined by a centrifugal ultrafiltration-HPLC assay using 42 pyridylaminated oligosaccharides. BCA bound to high mannose-type N-glycans but not to the complex-type, hybrid-type core structure of N-glycans or oligosaccharides from glycolipids. This lectin had exclusive specificity for α1-2-linked mannose at the nonreducing terminus. The binding activity was enhanced as the number of terminal α1-2-linked mannose substitutions increased. Mannobiose, mannotriose, and mannopentaose were incapable of binding to BCA. Thus, BCA preferentially recognized the nonreducing terminal α1-2-mannose cluster as a primary target. As predicted from carbohydrate-binding propensity, this lectin inhibited the HIV-1 entry into the host cells at a half-maximal effective concentration of 8.2 nm. A high association constant (3.71 × 10(8) M(-1)) of BCA with the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 was demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance analysis. Moreover, BCA showed the potent anti-influenza activity by directly binding to viral envelope hemagglutinin against various strains, including a clinical isolate of pandemic H1N1-2009 virus, revealing its potential as an antiviral reagent.","Sato, Yuichiro; Hirayama, Makoto; Morimoto, Kinjiro; Yamamoto, Naoki; Okuyama, Satomi; Hori, Kanji",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m110.216655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21460211/,453

Methods: The epidemic feature of COVID-19 was described by different phases and was used to observe the effectiveness of intervention. Hierarchical spot map was drawn to clarify the distribution and transmission risk of infection sources at different time points. The Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Asymptomatic-Recovered model was established to estimate case numbers without intervention and compare with the actual number of cases to determine the effect of intervention. The positive rate of the nucleic acid test was used to reflect the risk of human exposure. A survey on COVID-19 related knowledge, attitude and behaviors were used to estimate the abilities of personal protection and emergency response. Results: The epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen experienced the rising, plateau and decline stage. The case number increased rapidly at the beginning, with short duration of peak period. Although the epidemic curve showed human-to-human transmission, the ""trailing"" was not obvious. From the spot map, during the intervention period, the source of infection was widely distributed. More cases and higher transmission risk were observed in areas with higher population density. After the effective intervention measures, both infection sources and the risk of transmission decreased. After compared with the estimated case numbers without intervention, actual number proved the COVID-19 control strategies were effective. The positive rate of nucleic acid test for high risk populations decreased and no new cases reported since February 16. Shenzhen citizens had high knowledge, attitude and behavior level, and high protection ability and emergency response. Conclusion: Although the response initiated by the health administration department played a key role at the early stage of the epidemic, it was not enough to contain the outbreak of COVID-19. The first-level emergency response initiated by provincial and municipal government was effective and ensured the start of work resumption after the Spring Festival.

Deciding when to cease surveillance is challenging. METHODS There are no publications focused on surveillance of elderly patients for CRC metastases. A systematic review of studies reporting treatment outcomes for CRC metastases in elderly patients was performed to assess the risk-benefit balance of the key objectives of surveillance; detecting and treating CRC metastases. RESULTS Sixty-eight eligible studies reported outcomes for surgery and chemotherapy in the elderly. Liver resections and use of chemotherapy, including biologics, are more conservative and have poorer outcomes in the elderly compared with younger patients. Selected studies demonstrated poorer quality-of-life (QoL) following surgery and chemotherapy. Studies of ablation in elderly patients are limited. DISCUSSION The survival benefit of treating CRC metastases with surgery or chemotherapy decreases with advancing age and QoL may decline in the elderly. The relatively lower efficacy and detrimental QoL impact of multimodal therapy options for detected CRC metastases in the elderly questions the benefit of surveillance in some elderly patients. Care of elderly patients should thus be customized based on their preference, formal geriatric assessment, natural life-expectancy, and the perceived risk-benefit balance of treating recurrent CRC metastases.

Aim of the present study was to compare the effects of Near-Infrared (NIR) Light-Emitting Diode (LED) irradiation and different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) alone or combined to each other on the E. faecalis biofilm, on artificial and human dentin surfaces. E. faecalis ATCC 29212 preformed biofilms, on polystyrene wells and on dentin discs, were treated with 880 nm NIR irradiation and NaOCl at 4%, 2.5%, 1% and 0.5% alone and combined to each other (NIR irradiation plus NaOCl 1% or 0.5%) at 5 and 10 min. Treated biofilms were compared to the controls for (i) biofilm biomass evaluation, (ii) CFU count for the quantification of cultivable cells and (iii) cells viability. All the detected experimental conditions displayed a significant reduction of biofilm biomass (p < 0.001) and CFUs/mL (p < 0.01) in respect to the controls on both tested surfaces. The effects on the E. faecalis biomass, colony count and cell viability were not time-dependent except for NaOCl 2.5% and 1% in the biofilm biomass reductions on human dentin discs. NIR-LED irradiation alone showed a reduction of E. faecalis aggregates without interfering with cell viability whereas NaOCl alone expressed a killing effect in a concentration dependent way. The combination of NIR-LED irradiation with NaOCl 1% and 0.5% displayed a double effect of cluster disaggregation and cell killing. In particular, NIR-LED irradiation combined with NaOCl 0.5% displayed an anti-biofilm activity major than those expressed by NaOCl 0.5% alone (p = 0.001) with a reduction of biomass 93% vs 71% and 97% vs 25% after 10 min, on polystyrene wells and human dentin discs, respectively. The innovative use of NIR-LED irradiation combined at short times with low concentration of NaOCl (1% and 0.5%) is capable to reach a significant effect on E. faecalis biofilm, especially on human dentin discs.","D'Ercole, Simonetta; Di Fermo, Paola; Di Giulio, Mara; Di Lodovico, Silvia; Di Campli, Emanuela; Scarano, Antonio; Tripodi, Domenico; Cellini, Luigina; Petrini, Morena","Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

Cases were compared with 100 OP matched according to: diagnosis, number of lesions, type of resection, age, ASA score, and ECOG performance status. We evaluated intraoperative and postoperative parameters, focusing on morbidity and mortality. RESULTS Preoperative data were comparable in both groups. Operative features were similar in terms of overall morbidity 18 (36 %) vs. 36 (36 %), p = 1; intraoperative bleeding, 401 (18-2192) vs. 475 (20-2000) mL, p = 0.89; pedicle clamping, 37 (74 %) vs. 88 (88 %), p = 0.55; margin, 0.6 (0-5) vs. 0.65 (0-5) cm, p = 0.94, and mortality p = 0.65 for the LAP and OP groups, respectively. There was a significant decrease in surgical site infections 1 (2 %) vs. 18 (18 %) p = 0.007 in the LAP group. Operative time was longer: 295 (120-600) vs. 200 (70-450) min (p = 0.0001), and hospital stay significantly shorter: 4 (1-60) vs. 7 (3-44) days, p = 0.0001 with less readmissions (0 vs. 7 %) in the LAP. DISCUSSION In adequately selected patients, laparoscopic hepatectomy is feasible, safe, shortens hospital stay, and decreases surgical site infections.","López-Ben, Santiago; Palacios, Oscar; Codina-Barreras, Antonio; Albiol, M Teresa; Falgueras, Laia; Castro, Ernesto; Figueras, Joan",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-014-1169-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24526221/,453

Boys are more likely to use active transport modes than girls. Girls and boys benefit differently from interventions that promote AC. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the effects of interventions on girls and boys and to appraise the extent to which previous studies have taken sex/gender into account. Eleven electronic databases were searched to identify all relevant randomized and non-randomized controlled trials based on a priori defined eligibility criteria. Two independent reviewers screened the literature for eligibility and assessed risk of bias. Semiquantitative analyses were conducted to evaluate the effects of intervention effects by taking sex/gender aspects into account. To evaluate sex/gender considerations in interventional studies, a recently developed sex/gender checklist was applied. Twelve studies were included that examined intervention effects on AC in girls and boys. Three intervention studies showed significant effects in increasing AC, with one study favoring girls, one favoring boys, and another focusing on a single sex/gender (only girls). According to the checklist, the overall sex/gender rating highlighted a lack of information in sex/gender consideration. Studies with and without significant effects indicated no differences in the sex/gender checklist. The results indicate that sex/gender is not considered adequately in primary interventional research on AC. To evaluate the effectiveness of intervention in boys and girls, detailed analyses of sex/gender are required, and better reporting about sex/gender-specific intervention content is necessary. In future health research to promote AC, sex/gender should be systematically taken into account.","Marzi, Isabel; Emmerling, Sandra; Demetriou, Yolanda; Bucksch, Jens; Schulze, Carolin; Brindley, Catherina; Reimers, Anne Kerstin",Frontiers in sports and active living,https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2020.590857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33345167/,453

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can efficiently immortalize B-cells to establish lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) and so it has been used extensively for transformation of B-cells to produce and secrete immunoglobulin. The present study addressed the effect of TLR7/8 agonist (R848), feeder cells layer and ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) cell separation methods on the transformation efficiency of antibody-producing memory B-cells. For these studies, the antigen used for analyses of antibody formation was the tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) derived from Clostridium tetani. The results here showed that employing an HFFF.PI6 feeder cell layer, R848 agonist and FACS-mediated purification of memory B-cells led to increased transformation efficiency. Altogether, the effects of the R848 and the feeder cells provided an efficient method for EBV transformation of human B-cells. Moreover, there was an advantage in using FACS sorting of B-cells over the MACS method in the context of EBV transformation and immortalization of precursors of antigen-specific B-cells.","Sadreddini, Sanam; Jadidi-Niaragh, Farhad; Younesi, Vahid; Pourlak, Tala; Afkham, Amir; Shokri, Fazel; Yousefi, Mehdi",Journal of immunotoxicology,https://doi.org/10.3109/1547691x.2015.1132288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27043044/,453

Total resection of the gastric tube with lymph node dissection is considered a radical treatment, but GTC surgery is more invasive and involves a higher risk of severe complications or death, particularly in elderly patients. CASE SUMMARY We report an elderly patient with early GTC that had invaded the duodenum who was successfully treated with resection of the distal gastric tube and Roux-en-Y (R-Y) reconstruction. The tumor was a type 0-IIc lesion with ulcer scars surrounding the pyloric ring. Endoscopic submucosal resection was not indicated because the primary lesion was submucosally invasive, was undifferentiated type, surrounded the pyloric ring, and had invaded the duodenum. Resection of distal gastric tube with R-Y reconstruction was safely performed, with preservation of the right gastroepiploic artery (RGEA) and right gastric artery (RGA). CONCLUSION Distal resection of the gastric tube with preservation of the RGEA and RGA is a good treatment option for elderly patients with cT1bN0 GTC in the lower part of the gastric tube.","Yura, Masahiro; Koyanagi, Kazuo; Adachi, Kiyohiko; Hara, Asuka; Hayashi, Keita; Tajima, Yuki; Kaneko, Yasushi; Fujisaki, Hiroto; Hirata, Akira; Takano, Kiminori; Hongo, Kumiko; Yo, Kikuo; Yoneyama, Kimiyasu; Dehari, Reiko; Nakagawa, Motohito",World journal of gastrointestinal surgery,https://doi.org/10.4240/wjgs.v12.i9.397; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33024514/,453

We applied a systems serology approach to identify Vi-specific serological correlates of protection using samples obtained from participants enrolled in an experimental controlled human infection study. Participants were vaccinated with Vi-tetanus toxoid conjugate (Vi-TT) or unconjugated Vi-polysaccharide (Vi-PS) vaccines and were subsequently challenged with Salmonella Typhi bacteria. Multivariate analyses identified distinct protective signatures for Vi-TT and Vi-PS vaccines in addition to shared features that predicted protection across both groups. Vi IgA quantity and avidity correlated with protection from S. Typhi infection, whereas higher fold increases in Vi IgG responses were associated with reduced disease severity. Targeted antibody-mediated functional responses, particularly neutrophil phagocytosis, were also identified as important components of the protective signature. These humoral markers could be used to evaluate and develop efficacious Vi-conjugate vaccines and assist with accelerating vaccine availability to typhoid-endemic regions.","Jin, Celina; Hill, Jennifer; Gunn, Bronwyn M; Yu, Wen-Han; Dahora, Lindsay C; Jones, Elizabeth; Johnson, Mari; Gibani, Malick M; Spreng, Rachel L; Alam, S Munir; Nebykova, Anna; Juel, Helene B; Dennison, S Moses; Seaton, Kelly E; Fallon, Jonathan K; Tomaras, Georgia D; Alter, Galit; Pollard, Andrew J",The Journal of experimental medicine,https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20201116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33180929/,453

Potential candidates are tested in adult populations and questions arise of whether COVID-19 vaccination should be implemented in children. Compared to adults, the incidence and disease severity of COVID-19 is low in children and despite their infectiveness, their role in disease propagation is limited. Therefore, COVID-19 vaccines will need to have fully demonstrated safety and efficacy in preventing not only complications but transmission to justify childhood vaccination. This work summarizes currently tested vaccine platforms and debates practical and ethical considerations for their potential use in children. It also discusses the already deleterious effect of the pandemic on routine childhood vaccine coverage, calling for action to limit the risks for a rise in vaccine-preventable diseases.","Eberhardt, Christiane Sigrid; Siegrist, Claire-Anne",Pediatric allergy and immunology : official publication of the European Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/pai.13401; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33113210/,453

Based on concepts introduced with the CellPack program, we report new algorithms to create such large-scale models using an intermediate coarse-grained ""pet representation"" of biomolecules with 1/10th the normal size. Pet atoms are placed such that they optimally trace the surface of the original molecule with just ∼1/50th the original atom number and are joined with covalent bonds. Molecular dynamics simulations of pet molecules allow for efficient packing optimization, as well as the generation of realistic DNA/RNA conformations. This pet world can be expanded back to the all-atom representation to be explored and visualized with full details. Essential for the efficient interactive visualization of gigastructures is the use of multiple levels of detail (LODs), where distant molecules are drawn with a heavily reduced polygon count. We present a grid-based algorithm to create such LODs for all common molecular graphics styles (including ball-and-sticks (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball-and-stick_model), ribbons, and cartoons) that do not require monochrome molecules to hide LOD transitions. As a practical application, we built all-atom models of SARS-CoV-2, HIV, and an entire presynaptic bouton with 1 μm diameter and 3.6 billion atoms, using modular building blocks to significantly reduce GPU memory requirements through instancing. We employ the Vulkan graphics API to maximize performance on consumer grade hardware and describe how to use the mmCIF format to efficiently store such giant models.

Whether the seroprevalence and factors associated with symptomatic COVID-19 are similar in IMID patients and in the general population is still unknown. Objectives: To assess the serological and clinical prevalence of COVID-19 in European IMID patients, along with the factors associated with its risk and the impacts the pandemic had on the IMID management. Methods: Prospective multicentre cross-sectional study among patients with five IMID (i.e. systemic lupus erythematous, Sjögren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondylarthritis or giant cell arteritis) from six tertiary-referral centers from France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain and United Kingdom. Demographics, comorbidities, IMID, treatments, flares and COVID-19 details were collected. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological tests were systematically performed. Results: Between June 7 and December 8, 2020, 3028 patients were included (median age 58 years, 73.9% females). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 166 (5.5%) patients. Symptomatic COVID-19 was seen in 122 patients (prevalence: 4.0%, 95% CI 3.4-4.8%);23 (24.2%) of them were hospitalized and four (3.2%) died. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, symptomatic COVID-19 was more likely to be observed in patients with higher levels of C-reactive protein (OR: 1.18;95% CI 1.05-1.33;p = 0.006), and increased with the number of IMID flares (OR: 1.27;95% CI 1.02-1.58;p = 0.03). Conversely, it was less likely to occur in patients treated with biological therapy (OR: 0.51;95% CI 0.32-0.82;p = 0.006). During the pandemic, at least one self-reported disease flare was seen in 654 (21.6%) patients. Also, 519 (20.6%) patients experienced changes in their treatment, with 125 of these (24.1%) being due to COVID-19. Conclusion: The SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in IMID patients over the study period seems to be similar to that of the general population1.

167442,Corona-Krise: Königreich für einen Flickenteppich,2020,"Time-sync comments reveal a new way of extracting the online video tags. However, such time-sync comments have lots of noises due to users' diverse comments, introducing great challenges for accurate and fast video tag extractions. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised video tag extraction algorithm named Semantic Weight-Inverse Document Frequency (SW-IDF). Specifically, we first generate corresponding semantic association graph (SAG) using semantic similarities and timestamps of the time-sync comments. Second, we propose two graph cluster algorithms, i.e., dialogue-based algorithm and topic center-based algorithm, to deal with the videos with different density of comments. Third, we design a graph iteration algorithm to assign the weight to each comment based on the degrees of the clustered subgraphs, which can differentiate the meaningful comments from the noises. Finally, we gain the weight of each word by combining Semantic Weight (SW) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF). In this way, the video tags are extracted automatically in an unsupervised way. Extensive experiments have shown that SW-IDF (dialogue-based algorithm) achieves 0.4210 F1-score and 0.4932 MAP (Mean Average Precision) in high-density comments, 0.4267 F1-score and 0.3623 MAP in low-density comments; while SW-IDF (topic center-based algorithm) achieves 0.4444 F1-score and 0.5122 MAP in high-density comments, 0.4207 F1-score and 0.3522 MAP in low-density comments.

In the battle against the outbreak of COVID-19, how to manage and share the COVID-19 Electric Medical Records (CEMRs) safely and effectively in the world, prevent malicious users from tampering with CEMRs, and protect the privacy of patients are very worthy of attention. In particular, the semi-trusted medical cloud platform has become the primary means of hospital medical data management and information services. Security and privacy issues in the medical cloud platform are more prominent and should be addressed with priority. To address these issues, on the basis of ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption, we propose a blockchain-empowered security and privacy protection scheme with traceable and direct revocation for COVID-19 medical records. The security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme is indicated to be safe under the Decision Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption and can resist many attacks. The simulation experiment demonstrates that the communication and storage overhead is less than other schemes in the public-private key generation, CEMRs encryption, and decryption stages. Besides, we also verify that the proposed scheme works well in the blockchain in terms of both throughput and delay.

SL2 is a structure shown to interact with human calreticulin (CAL), an autoantigen potentially involved in RUB RNA replication and pathogenesis. RNase mapping indicated that SL2 and SL3 are in equilibrium between two conformations, in the second of which the previously proposed CAL binding site in SL2, a U-U bulge, is not formed. Site-directed mutagenesis of the 3' UTR with a RUB infectious clone, Robo302, revealed that most of the 3' UTR is required for viral viability except for the 3'-terminal 5 nt and the poly(A) tract, although poly(A) was rapidly regenerated during subsequent replication. Maintenance of the overall SL3 structure, the 11-nt single-stranded sequence between SL3 and SL4, and the sequences forming SL4 were all important for viral viability. Studies on the interaction between host factors and the 3' UTR showed the formation of three RNA-protein complexes by gel mobility shift assay, and UV-induced cross-linking detected six host protein species, with molecular masses of 120, 80, 66, 55, 48, and 36 kDa, interacting with the 3' UTR. Site-directed mutagenesis of SL2 by nucleotide substitutions showed that maintenance of SL2 stem rather than the U-U bulge was critical in CAL binding since mutants having the U-U bulge base paired had a similar binding activity for CAL as the native structure whereas mutants having the SL2 stem destabilized had much lower binding activity. However, all of these mutations gave rise to viable viruses when introduced into Robo302, indicating that binding of CAL to SL2 is independent of viral viability.","Chen, M H; Frey, T K",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10074193/,453

Here we take the coronavirus pandemic as a global and extraordinarily consequential case, and study the global policy response by analyzing a novel dataset recording policy documents published by government agencies, think tanks, and intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) across 114 countries (37,725 policy documents from Jan 2nd through May 26th 2020). Our analyses reveal four primary findings. (1) Global policy attention to COVID-19 follows a remarkably similar trajectory as the total confirmed cases of COVID-19, yet with evolving policy focus from public health to broader social issues. (2) The COVID-19 policy frontier disproportionately draws on the latest, peer-reviewed, and high-impact scientific insights. Moreover, policy documents that cite science appear especially impactful within the policy domain. (3) The global policy frontier is primarily interconnected through IGOs, such as the WHO, which produce policy documents that are central to the COVID19 policy network and draw especially strongly on scientific literature. Removing IGOs' contributions fundamentally alters the global policy landscape, with the policy citation network among government agencies increasingly fragmented into many isolated clusters. (4) Countries exhibit highly heterogeneous policy attention to COVID-19. Most strikingly, a country's early policy attention to COVID-19 shows a surprising degree of predictability for the country's subsequent deaths. Overall, these results uncover fundamental patterns of policy interactions and, given the consequential nature of emergent threats and the paucity of quantitative approaches to understand them, open up novel dimensions for assessing and effectively coordinating global and local responses to COVID-19 and beyond.","Gao, Jian; Yin, Yian; Jones, Benjamin F.; Wang, Dashun",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13853v1.pdf,453

The mortality rates of severe cases range from 8.1% to 38%, and it is particularly important to identify risk factors that aggravate the disease. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature with meta-analysis, using 7 databases to identify studies reporting on clinical characteristics, comorbidities and complications in severe and non-severe patients with COVID-19. All the observational studies were included. We performed a random or fixed effects model meta-analysis to calculate the pooled proportion and 95% confidence interval (CI). Measure of heterogeneity was estimated by Cochran's Q statistic, I index and P value. RESULTS: A total of 4881 cases from 25 studies related to COVID-19 were included. The most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension (severe: 33.4%, 95% CI: 25.4%-41.4%; non-severe 21.6%, 95% CI: 9.9%-33.3%), followed by diabetes (severe: 14.4%, 95% CI: 11.5%-17.3%; non-severe: 8.5%, 95% CI: 6.1%-11.0%). The prevalence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury and shock were all higher in severe cases, with 41.1% (95% CI: 14.1%-68.2%), 16.4% (95% CI: 3.4%-29.5%) and 19.9% (95% CI: 5.5%-34.4%), rather than 3.0% (95% CI: 0.6%-5.5%), 2.2% (95% CI: 0.1%-4.2%) and 4.1% (95% CI: -4.8%-13.1%) in non-severe patients, respectively. The death rate was higher in severe cases (30.3%, 95% CI: 13.8%-46.8%) than non-severe cases (1.5%, 95% CI: 0.1%-2.8%).

METHODS: The Mayo Clinic Serology Screening Program was created to provide a voluntary, two-stage testing program for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to health care personnel. The first stage used a dried blood spot screening test initiated on June 15, 2020. Those participants identified as reactive were advised to have confirmatory testing via a venipuncture. Venipuncture results through August 8, 2020, were considered. Consent and authorization for testing was required to participate in the screening program. This report, which was conducted under an institutional review board-approved protocol, only includes employees who have further authorized their records for use in research. RESULTS: A total of 81,113 health care personnel were eligible for the program, and of these 29,606 participated in the screening program. A total of 4284 (14.5%) of the dried blood spot test results were ""reactive"" and warranted confirmatory testing. Confirmatory testing was completed on 4094 (95.6%) of the screen reactive with an overall seroprevalence rate of 0.60% (95% CI, 0.52% to 0.69%). Significant variation in seroprevalence was observed by region of the country and age group. CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies through August 8, 2020, was found to be lower than previously reported in other health care organizations.

BCG exhibits heterologous protective effects against unrelated infections and reduces infant mortality due to non-mycobacterial infections. Recent reports have suggested that BCG vaccination might have protective effects against COVID-19, however it is highly unlikely that BCG vaccine in its current form can offer complete protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the lack of specific immunity. Nonetheless, recombinant BCG strains expressing antigens of SARS-CoV-2 may offer protection against COVID-19 due to the activation of innate as well as specific adaptive immune response. Further proven safety records of BCG in humans, its adjuvant activity and low cost manufacturing makes it a frontrunner in the vaccine development to stop this pandemic. In this review we discuss about the heterologous effects of BCG, induction of trained immunity and its implication in development of a potential vaccine against COVID-19 pandemic.","Gupta, Pramod Kumar",Cell Immunol,,453

However, in the wake of the emergence of viral variants, able to evade vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies, real world vaccine efficacy has begun to show differences across the mRNA platforms, suggesting that subtle variation in immune responses induced by the BNT162b2 and mRNA1273 vaccines may provide differential protection. Given our emerging appreciation for the importance of additional antibody functions, beyond neutralization, here we profiled the postboost binding and functional capacity of the humoral response induced by the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 in a cohort of hospital staff. Both vaccines induced robust humoral immune responses to WT SARS-CoV-2 and VOCs. However, differences emerged across epitopespecific responses, with higher RBD- and NTD-specific IgA, as well as functional antibodies (ADNP and ADNK) in mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. Additionally, RBD-specific antibody depletion highlighted the different roles of non-RBD-specific antibody effector function induced across the mRNA vaccines, providing novel insights into potential differences in protective immunity generated across these vaccines in the setting of newly emerging VOCs.","Kaplonek, Paulina; Cizmeci, Deniz; Fischinger, Stephanie; Collier, Ai-ris; Suscovich, Todd; Linde, Caitlyn; Broge, Thomas; Mann, Colin; Amanat, Fatima; Dayal, Diana; Rhee, Justin; Aubin, Michael de St.; Nilles, Eric J.; Musk, Elon R.; Menon, Anil S.; Saphire, Erica Ollmann; Krammer, Florian; Lauffenburger, Douglas A; Barouch, Dan H.; Alter, Galit",,,453

However, our understanding of the clinical characteristics and treatment of critically ill pediatric patients and their ability of transmitting the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 still remains inadequate because only a handful pediatric cases of COVID-19 have been reported. METHODS: Epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment, laboratory data and follow-up information and the treatment of critically ill infant were recorded. RESULTS: The infant had life-threatening clinical features including high fever, septic shock, recurrent apnea, petechiae and acute kidney injury and persistent declined CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The duration of nasopharyngeal virus shedding lasted for 49 days even with the administration of lopinavir/ritonavir for 8 days. The CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was partially recovered 68 days post onset of the disease. Accumulating of effector memory CD4+ T cells (CD4+TEM) was observed among T-cell compartment. The nucleic acid tests and serum antibody for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 of the infant's mother who kept intimate contact with the infant were negative despite no strict personal protection. CONCLUSIONS: The persistent reduction of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was the typical feature of critically ill infant with COVID-19. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells might play a key role in aggravating COVID-19 and predicts a more critical course in children. The prolonged nasopharyngeal virus shedding was related with the severity of respiratory injury.

The convergence of pandemic resource limitation and clinical demand associated with delirium requires careful risk stratification for targeted prevention efforts. Objectives: To develop an incident delirium predictive model among coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Methods: We applied supervised machine learning to electronic health record data for inpatients with coronavirus disease 2019 at three hospitals to build an incident delirium diagnosis prediction model. We validated this model in three different hospitals. Both hospital cohorts included academic and community settings. Results: Among 2907 patients across 6 hospitals, 488 (16.8%) developed delirium. Applying the predictive model in the external validation cohort of 755 patients, the c-index was 0.75 (0.71-0.79) and the lift in the top quintile was 2.1. At a sensitivity of 80%, the specificity was 56%, negative predictive value 92%, and positive predictive value 30%. Equivalent model performance was observed in subsamples stratified by age, sex, race, need for critical care and care at community vs. academic hospitals. Conclusion: Machine learning applied to electronic health records available at the time of inpatient admission can be used to risk-stratify patients with coronavirus disease 2019 for incident delirium.

This brings serious clinical concerns regarding the potential need for in-depth cardiac screening in athletes after Covid-19 before return to play. The aim of this study was to gain further insight into the relation between Covid-19 and cardiac involvement in professional athletes. This was a retrospective cohort study, in which 26 consecutive elite athletes (national team, Olympians, top national league players; median age 24 years, interquartile range [IQR] 21-27, 81% female) were included. At 1.5 T including balanced steady-state free precession cine imaging, T1 and T2-mapping using Myomaps software (Siemens), dark-blood T2-weighted images with fat suppression, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with phase-sensitive inversion recovery sequence were used. The athletes had mainly asymptomatic or mild course of the disease (77%). They were scanned after a median of 32 days (IQR 22-62 days) from the diagnosis. MR data were reviewed by three independent observers, each with >10 years cardiac MR experience. Native T1, T2, extracellular volume, and T2 signal intensity ratio were calculated. Diagnosis of acute myocarditis was based on modified Lake Louise criteria. Statistical analyses used were Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman repeatability analysis. At the time of MR the athletes had no pathologic electrocardiogram abnormalities or elevated troponin levels. MR did not reveal any case of acute myocarditis. Cardiac abnormalities were found in five (19%) athletes, including four athletes presenting borderline signs of isolated myocardial edema and one athlete showing nonischemic LGE with pleural and pericardial effusion. Another athlete had signs of persistent lung congestion without cardiac involvement. We have shown that in a small group of elite athletes with mainly asymptomatic to mild Covid-19, lack of electrocardiographic changes, and normal troponin concentration 1-2 months after the diagnosis, there were no signs of acute myocarditis, but 19% of athletes had some abnormalities as assessed by cardiac MR.

Nicht mit Doppelbotschaften,2020,"This paper introduces a new hybrid approach (DBH) for solving gene selection problem that incorporates the strengths of two existing metaheuristics: binary dragonfly algorithm (BDF) and binary black hole algorithm (BBHA). This hybridization aims to identify a limited and stable set of discriminative genes without sacrificing classification accuracy, whereas most current methods have encountered challenges in extracting disease-related information from a vast amount of redundant genes. The proposed approach first applies the minimum redundancy maximum relevancy (MRMR) filter method to reduce the dimensionality of feature space and then utilizes the suggested hybrid DBH algorithm to determine a smaller set of significant genes. The proposed approach was evaluated on eight benchmark gene expression datasets, and then, was compared against the latest state-of-art techniques to demonstrate algorithm efficiency. The comparative study shows that the proposed approach achieves a significant improvement as compared with existing methods in terms of classification accuracy and the number of selected genes. Moreover, the performance of the suggested method was examined on real RNA-Seq coronavirus-related gene expression data of asthmatic patients for selecting the most significant genes in order to improve the discriminative accuracy of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2, as a coronavirus receptor, is a biomarker that helps to classify infected patients from uninfected in order to identify subgroups at risk for COVID-19. The result denotes that the suggested MRMR-DBH approach represents a very promising framework for finding a new combination of most discriminative genes with high classification accuracy.","Pashaei, Elnaz; Pashaei, Elham",Anal Biochem,,453

246342,"""Fortbildung kann nicht besser gelebt werden als in dieser Zeit""",2020,"Currently, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has infected people among all countries and is a pandemic as declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). SARS-CoVID-2 main protease is one of the therapeutic drug targets that has been shown to reduce virus replication, and its high-resolution 3D structures in complex with inhibitors have been solved. Previously, we had demonstrated the potential of natural compounds such as serine protease inhibitors eventually leading us to hypothesize that FDA-approved marine drugs have the potential to inhibit the biological activity of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Initially, field-template and structure-activity atlas models were constructed to understand and explain the molecular features responsible for SARS-CoVID-2 main protease inhibitors, which revealed that Eribulin Mesylate, Plitidepsin, and Trabectedin possess similar characteristics related to SARS-CoVID-2 main protease inhibitors. Later, protein-ligand interactions are studied using ensemble molecular-docking simulations that revealed that marine drugs bind at the active site of the main protease. The three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) studies show that marine drugs displace water molecules at the active site, and interactions observed are favorable. These computational studies eventually paved an interest in further in vitro studies. Finally, these findings are new and indeed provide insights into the role of FDA-approved marine drugs, which are already in clinical use for cancer treatment as a potential alternative to prevent and treat infected people with SARS-CoV-2.","Kalhotra, Poonam; Chittepu, Veera C S R; Osorio-Revilla, Guillermo; Gallardo-Velazquez, Tzayhri",Molecules (Basel),,453

We sought to find out what other alternative materials and methods would be used among populations without running water and who may not afford alcohol-based sanitizers. Results: We reviewed studies that reported use of sand, soil, ash, soda ash, seawater, alkaline materials, and sunlight as possible alternatives to handwashing with soap and water. We identified the documented mechanism of actions of these alternative wash methods on both inanimate surfaces and at cellular levels. The consideration of use of these alternative locally available in situations of unavailability of soap and water and alcohol-based sanitizers is timely in the face of coronavirus pandemic. Further randomized studies need to be carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of these alternatives in management of SARS-Cov-2.","Kivuti-Bitok, Lucy W; Chepchirchir, Angeline; Waithaka, Peter; Ngune, Irene",J Prim Care Community Health,,453
249078,"Bioaerosol emissions from activated sludge basins: Characterization, release, and attenuation",2020,"Instead of commercial lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) using organic liquid electrolytes, all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries (ASSBs) employing solid electrolytes (SEs) are promising for applications in high-energy-density power applications and electric vehicles due to their potential for improving safety and achieving high capacity. Although remarkable progress in SEs has been achieved and has resulted in high ionic conductivity, which now reaches values comparable to those of liquid electrolytes, the typical use of a slurry process for the fabrication of conventional ASSBs inevitably causes harmful reactions between sulfide materials and polar solvents. Here, we studied the efficient infiltration process of SE slurry into conventional composite LIB electrodes (NCM622) for achieving high-energy-density ASSBs via a scalable solution-based fabrication process. Two methods are proposed to ensure that SE materials are evenly distributed and sufficiently infiltrated into the porous structures of LIB electrodes. The LPSCl SE solutions were effectively infiltrated into the electrodes at higher processing temperatures and the temperature was subsequently optimized at above the boiling point of the ethanol solvent due to the dynamic motion of SE molecules via a convective flow during solvent vaporization. Moreover, the porous LIB composite electrodes with a mixture of active materials of different particle sizes formed and filled capillary pores resulting in a high electrode density. The LPSCl SE-infiltrated NCM622 electrodes that used this strategy could remarkably improve the initial discharge capacity of ASSBs to as high as 177 mAh/g. These ASSBs also showed excellent performance even at high loading values (about 17 mg/cm2), making them competitive with LIBs using conventional liquid electrolytes.","Kim, Min-Ju; Park, Jun-Woo; Kim, Byung Gon; Lee, You-Jin; Ha, Yoon-Cheol; Lee, Sang-Min; Baeg, Kang-Jun",Sci Rep,,453

The course of this pandemic will be shaped by how governments enact timely policies and disseminate information and by how the public reacts to policies and information. Here, we examine information-seeking responses to the first COVID-19 case public announcement in a state. Using an event study framework for all US states, we show that such news increases collective attention to the crisis right away. However, the elevated level of attention is short-lived, even though the initial announcements are followed by increasingly strong policy measures. Specifically, searches for ""coronavirus"" increased by about 36% (95% CI: 27 to 44%) on the day immediately after the first case announcement but decreased back to the baseline level in less than a week or two. We find that people respond to the first report of COVID-19 in their state by immediately seeking information about COVID-19, as measured by searches for coronavirus, coronavirus symptoms, and hand sanitizer. On the other hand, searches for information regarding community-level policies (e.g., quarantine, school closures, testing) or personal health strategies (e.g., masks, grocery delivery, over-the-counter medications) do not appear to be immediately triggered by first reports. These results are representative of the study period being relatively early in the epidemic, and more-elaborate policy responses were not yet part of the public discourse. Further analysis should track evolving patterns of responses to subsequent flows of public information.","Bento, Ana I; Nguyen, Thuy; Wing, Coady; Lozano-Rojas, Felipe; Ahn, Yong-Yeol; Simon, Kosali",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,453

Therefore, there is a recognized need to identify risk factors for COVID-19 severity and mortality. A systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) for studies published before September 29, 2020, was performed. Studies that investigated risk factors for progression and mortality in COVID-19 patients were included. A total 344,431 participants from 34 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Regarding comorbidities, cerebrovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), coronary heart disease (CHD), and malignancy were associated with an increased risk of progression and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Regarding clinical manifestations, sputum production was associated with a dramatically increased risk of progression and mortality. Hemoptysis was a risk factor for death in COVID-19 patients. In laboratory examinations, increased neutrophil count, decreased lymphocyte count, decreased platelet count, increased C-reactive protein (CRP), coinfection with bacteria or fungi, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK), increased N-terminal pronatriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and bilateral pneumonia in CT/X-ray were significantly more frequent in the severe group compared with the non-severe group. Moreover, the proportion of patients with increased CRP and total bilirubin (TBIL) was also significantly higher in the deceased group than in the survival group. CVD, CKD, sputum production, increased neutrophil count, decreased lymphocyte count, decreased platelet count, increased CRP, coinfection with bacteria or fungi, increased ALT and CK, increased NT-proBNP, and bilateral pneumonia in CT/X-ray were associated with an increased risk of progression in COVID-19 patients.

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the patient-reported Health Related Quality of Life outcomes and radiographic parameters of patients who underwent a single level transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion with either a polyetheretherketone (PEEK) or titanium interbody cage. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Spinal stenosis with instability is a common diagnosis that is often treated with interbody fusion, in particular transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. Titanium and PEEK interbody cage properties have been extensively studied to understand their effect on fusion rates and subsidence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted from a single, high volume, academic hospital. Health Related Quality of Life outcomes were obtained from Outcomes Based Electronic Research Database and electronic medical record chart review. Subsidence was defined as a loss of 2 mm or more in the anterior or posterior disk height. Spinopelvic alignment parameters measured were sacral slope, pelvic tilt, pelvic incidence, lumbar lordosis, segmental lordosis, and pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis mismatch. Fusion rates were assessed by the Brantigan-Steffee criteria. RESULTS: The study included a total of 137 patients (108 PEEK, 29 titanium). Overall, no significant changes were noted between the 2 groups at 3 month or 1-year follow-up. Perioperatively, patients did report improvement in all outcome parameters within the PEEK and titanium groups. No significant difference was noted in subsidence rate between the 2 groups. Segmental lordosis significantly increased within the PEEK (+4.8 degrees; P<0.001) and titanium (+4.6 degrees; P=0.003) cage groups, however no difference was noted between groups. No significant difference was noted in fusion between the PEEK and titanium cage cohorts (92.6% vs. 86.2%; P=0.36). CONCLUSION: Overall, while PEEK and titanium cages exhibit unique biomaterial properties, our study shows that there were no significant differences with respect to patient-reported outcomes or radiographic outcomes between the 2 groups at the 1-year follow-up time point.

We conducted a survey to investigate the level of stress and its association with job types, work departments, and medical centers among COVID-19 pandemic frontline medical personnel. Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey using a self-administered questionnaire among 307 frontline medical staff who cared for COVID-19 patients in Daegu city. We used a 33-item questionnaire to assess respondents' general characteristics, job stress, personal effects associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and their stress level. A general health questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) was included in our questionnaire. Results: Majority (74.3%) of the respondents were in the stress group. The mean GHQ-12 score was 14.31 ± 4.96. More females (67.4%, p < 0.05) and nurses (73.3%, p = 0.001) were in the stress group compared to males and doctors. Medical staff in the general ward considered the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic situation higher. Nurses perceived work changes (p < 0.05), work burden (p < 0.05), and personal impact (p < 0.05) more serious than doctors. Medical staff in Level 3 emergency department (ED) perceived a lack of real-time information (p = 0.012), a lack of resources, and negative personal impacts associated with the pandemic as more serious than staff in Level 1 and Level 2 EDs. Medical staff in the intensive care unit perceived work changes (p < 0.05), work burden (p < 0.05), and lack of personal protective equipment (p = 0.002) as more serious than staff in the ED and general ward. Conclusion: Providing real-time information and resources for reducing work burden and negative personal impact is central to maximizing the work output of the COVID-19 pandemic frontline medical staff.

Two members of this family, SOCS1 and SOCS3, are indispensable, since SOCS1 knockout in mice results in neonatal death due to interferon gamma (IFNÎ³) induced inflammatory disease, and SOCS3 knockout leads to embryonic lethality. We have shown that SOCS1 and SOCS3 (SOCS1/3) function as virus induced intrinsic virulence factors for influenza A virus, EMC virus, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), and vaccinia virus infections. Other viruses such as pathogenic pig enteric coronavirus and coronavirus induced severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spike protein also induce SOCS virus intrinsic virulence factors. SOCS1/3 exert their viral virulence effect via inhibition of type I and type II interferon (IFN) function. Specifically, the SOCS bind to the activation loop of receptor-associated tyrosine kinases JAK2 and TYK2 through the SOCS kinase inhibitory region (KIR), which inhibits STAT transcription factor activation by the kinases. Activated STATs are required for IFN function. We have developed a small peptide antagonist of SOCS1/3 that blocks SOCS1/3 inhibitory activity and prevents virus pathogenesis. The antagonist, pJAK2(1001-1013), is comprised of the JAK2 activation loop, phosphorylated at tyrosine 1007 with a palmitate for cell penetration. The remarkable thing about SOCS1/3 is that it serves as a broad, simple tool of perhaps most pathogenic viruses to avoid innate host IFN defense. We suggest in this Perspective that SOCS1/3 antagonist is a simple counter measure to SOCS1/3 and should be an effective mechanism as a prophylactic and/or therapeutic against the COVID-19 pandemic that is caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV2.","Johnson, Howard M; Lewin, Alfred S; Ahmed, Chulbul M",Front Immunol,,453

This has several reasons, but two explanations stick out: 1. lower long-term investment into healthcare in the UK rendered the NHS more vulnerable to Covid-19; 2. the existence of a well-governed decentralised and partially redundant organisation of healthcare increased resilience in Germany' s healthcare systems, enhancing the ability to adapt in response to unexpected challenges to healthcare.

We find that the combination of these interventions coincided with a reduction in the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 from 1.7 to 1.1, which was sufficient to avoid hospital saturation. We estimate that thanks to the young demographics, the risk of hospitalisation following infection was 0.3 times that of metropolitan France and that about 20% of the population was infected by July.

Mortality was the primary outcome, and the need for hospitalization was the secondary one. RESULTS: Out of 746 patients undergoing regular haemodialysis, 148 symptomatic patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and were included in the analysis. The overall mortality rate was 24.3%. By univariate analysis, older age, ischaemic heart disease, lower systolic blood pressure, lower body mass index (BMI) and higher frailty scores were associated with higher rates of mortality (all p value < 0.05). The laboratory factors associated with mortality were higher values of WBC, neutrophil counts, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), bilirubin, ferritin, troponin, and lower serum albumin level (all p value < 0.05). In the logistic regression, mortality was associated with older age and higher CRP, while high levels of NLR and CRP were associated with the need for hospitalization. DISCUSSION: Haemodialysis patients are susceptible to COVID-19 and have a high mortality rate. Our study identifies prognostic risk factors associated with poor outcome including age, frailty and markers of inflammation, which may support more informed clinical decision-making.","Hendra, Heidy; Vajgel, Gisele; Antonelou, Marilina; Neradova, Aegida; Manson, Bethia; Clark, Sarah Grace; Kostakis, Ioannis D; Caplin, Ben; Salama, Alan D",J. nephrol,,453

Molecular approaches such as reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offers highly sensitive and specific means to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, however, despite it being the accepted ""gold standard"", molecular platforms often require a tradeoff between speed versus throughput. Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-time of flight (TOF)-mass spectrometry (MS) has been proposed as a potential solution for COVID-19 testing and finding a balance between analytical performance, speed, and throughput, without relying on impacted supply chains. Combined with machine learning (ML), this MALDI-TOF-MS approach could overcome logistical barriers encountered by current testing paradigms. We evaluated the analytical performance of an ML-enhanced MALDI-TOF-MS method for screening COVID-19. Residual nasal swab samples from adult volunteers were used for testing and compared against RT-PCR. Two optimized ML models were identified, exhibiting accuracy of 98.3%, positive percent agreement (PPA) of 100%, negative percent agreement (NPA) of 96%, and accuracy of 96.6%, PPA of 98.5%, and NPA of 94% respectively. Machine learning enhanced MALDI-TOF-MS for COVID-19 testing exhibited performance comparable to existing commercial SARS-CoV-2 tests.","Tran, Nam K; Howard, Taylor; Walsh, Ryan; Pepper, John; Loegering, Julia; Phinney, Brett; Salemi, Michelle R; Rashidi, Hooman H",Sci Rep,,453

The result of this deep dive was a very comprehensive understanding of the potential and risks associated with the proposed work, which was far beyond what can typically be understood in a written grant application. This detail allowed the deep dive team to provide a better-informed recommendation on how to proceed. In some instances, the recommendation was made to not fund the project;in other cases, the recommendation was made to provide the applicant with more funding or support to help maximize their probability of success. After the deep dive, the project moved to a Work Package 1 (WP1) phase that focused on further de-risking. The same RADx Tech team that conducted the deep dive also worked with the applicant through the WP1 phase of the program.

An understanding of the utility of LUS in COVID-19 is crucial to determine its most suitable role based on local circumstances. Method: Online databases, specialist websites and social media platforms were searched to identify studies that explore the utility of LUS in COVID-19. Case reports and recommendations were excluded. Findings: In total, 33 studies were identified which represent a rapidly expanding evidence base for LUS in COVID-19. The quality of the included studies was relatively low; however, LUS certainly appears to be a highly sensitive and fairly specific test for COVID-19 in all ages and in pregnancy. Discussion: There may be LUS findings and patterns that are relatively specific to COVID-19; however, specificity may also be influenced by factors such as disease severity, pre-existing lung disease, operator experience, disease prevalence and the reference standard. Conclusion: LUS is almost certainly more sensitive than chest radiograph for COVID-19 and has several advantages over computed tomography and real-time polymerase chain reaction. High-quality research is needed into various aspects of LUS including: diagnostic accuracy in undifferentiated patients; triage and prognostication; monitoring progression and guiding interventions; the persistence of residual LUS findings; inter-observer agreement and the role of contrast-enhanced LUS.","Trauer, Michael M; Matthies, Ashley; Mani, Nick; McDermott, Cian; Jarman, Robert",Ultrasound,,453

309799,"Re: ""COVID-19 Recommendations From Ophthalmic and Plastic Reconstructive Surgery Societies Worldwide""",2020,"Recently, the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the world. Due to the large number of affected patients and heavy labor for doctors, computer-aided diagnosis with machine learning algorithm is urgently needed, and could largely reduce the efforts of clinicians and accelerate the diagnosis process. Chest computed tomography (CT) has been recognized as an informative tool for diagnosis of the disease. In this study, we propose to conduct the diagnosis of COVID-19 with a series of features extracted from CT images. To fully explore multiple features describing CT images from different views, a unified latent representation is learned which can completely encode information from different aspects of features and is endowed with promising class structure for separability. Specifically, the completeness is guaranteed with a group of backward neural networks (each for one type of features), while by using class labels the representation is enforced to be compact within COVID-19/community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and also a large margin is guaranteed between different types of pneumonia. In this way, our model can well avoid overfitting compared to the case of directly projecting highdimensional features into classes. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms all comparison methods, and rather stable performances are observed when varying the numbers of training data.","Kang, Hengyuan; Xia, Liming; Yan, Fuhua; Wan, Zhibin; Shi, Feng; Yuan, Huan; Jiang, Huiting; Wu, Dijia; Sui, He; Zhang, Changqing; Shen, Dinggang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03227v1.pdf,453

To address the myriad issues generated by this pandemic, an interdisciplinary breadth of research, clinical and public health communities has rapidly engaged to collectively find answers and solutions. One area of active inquiry is understanding the mode(s) of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Although respiratory droplets are a known mechanism of transmission, other mechanisms are likely. Of particular importance to global health is the possibility of vertical transmission from infected mothers to infants through breastfeeding or consumption of human milk. However, there is limited published literature related to vertical transmission of any human coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2) via human milk and/or breastfeeding. Results of the literature search reported here (finalized on 17 April 2020) revealed a single study providing some evidence of vertical transmission of human coronavirus 229E; a single study evaluating presence of SARS-CoV in human milk (it was negative); and no published data on MERS-CoV and human milk. We identified 13 studies reporting human milk tested for SARS-CoV-2; one study (a non-peer-reviewed preprint) detected the virus in one milk sample, and another study detected SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG in milk. Importantly, none of the studies on coronaviruses and human milk report validation of their collection and analytical methods for use in human milk.

In 2018 alone, Africa recorded over 400,000 AIDS-related deaths which is more than half of the global total. This reflects years of inequality in the global pandemic response. Also, the international response to AIDS in the early years was very slow, with a global programme only developed 6 years into the pandemic. Many African countries still lack pandemic preparedness plans to handle a global pandemic. Thus, this paper highlights the important lessons that can be learnt from the response to the AIDS pandemic and recommends how they can be applied during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Some of the important lessons include: HIV reversed the previous success recorded in health systems of developing countries; the antiretroviral drug development process was prolonged and required long term commitment; and primary healthcare was crucial in preventing and controlling the disease. These lessons can be utilised in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic. It is recommended that: there should be solidarity among the nations of the world to fight COVID-19; health authorities should be proactive in curbing misinformation; and interventions should prioritise human rights and focus on vulnerable communities. HIV treatment services should not be discontinued as it is still an ongoing pandemic. A balance needs to be achieved in combating both pandemics as discontinuation of HIV treatment during the coronavirus pandemic could result in more than 500,000 deaths.","Olufadewa, Isaac; Oduguwa, Ifeoluwa; Adesina, Miracle; Ibiang, Koton; Eke, Nnenne; Adewumi, Blessing; Ebong, Inimfon; Abudu, Funmilayo; Adeyelu, Nancy",Int. j. health plann. manage,,453

338935,An Argument for the Safety of Immediate Device Reconstruction following Mastectomy during the COVID-19 Crisis,2021,"The before-outbreak evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 is enigmatic because it shares only [~]96% genomic similarity with RaTG13, the closest relative so far found in wild animals (horseshoe bats). Since mutations on single-stranded viral RNA are heavily shaped by host factors, the viral mutation signatures can in turn inform the host. By comparing publically available viral genomes we here inferred the mutations SARS-CoV-2 accumulated before the outbreak and after the split from RaTG13. We found the mutation spectrum of SARS-CoV-2, which measures the relative rates of 12 mutation types, is 99.9% identical to that of RaTG13. It is also similar to that of two other bat coronaviruses but distinct from that evolved in non-bat hosts. The viral mutation spectrum informed the activities of a variety of mutation-associated host factors, which were found almost identical between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, a pattern difficult to create in laboratory. All the findings are robust after replacing RaTG13 with RshSTT182, another coronavirus found in horseshoe bats with [~]93% similarity to SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses suggest SARS-CoV-2 shared almost the same host environment with RaTG13 and RshSTT182 before the outbreak.","He, Xionglei",,,453

Digital health information technologies can be applied in three aspects, namely digital patients, digital devices, and digital clinics, and could be useful in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Recent reviews have examined the role of digital health in controlling COVID-19 to identify the potential of digital health interventions to fight the disease. However, this study aims to review and analyze the digital technology that is being applied to control the COVID-19 pandemic in the 10 countries with the highest prevalence of the disease. METHODS: For this review, the Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched in August 2020 to retrieve publications from December 2019 to March 15, 2020. Furthermore, the Google search engine was used to identify additional applications of digital health for COVID-19 pandemic control. RESULTS: We included 32 papers in this review that reported 37 digital health applications for COVID-19 control. The most common digital health projects to address COVID-19 were telemedicine visits (11/37, 30%). Digital learning packages for informing people about the disease, geographic information systems and quick response code applications for real-time case tracking, and cloud- or mobile-based systems for self-care and patient tracking were in the second rank of digital tool applications (all 7/37, 19%). The projects were deployed in various European countries and in the United States, Australia, and China. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the potential of available information technologies worldwide in the 21st century, particularly in developed countries, it appears that more digital health products with a higher level of intelligence capability remain to be applied for the management of pandemics and health-related crises.","R Niakan Kalhori, Sharareh; Bahaadinbeigy, Kambiz; Deldar, Kolsoum; Gholamzadeh, Marsa; Hajesmaeel-Gohari, Sadrieh; Ayyoubzadeh, Seyed Mohammad",J Med Internet Res,,453

The objective of this work was to develop a simple immunosensor for rapid and high sensitivity measurements of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in serum. This assay is based on a unique sensing scheme utilizing dually-labeled magnetic nanobeads for immunomagnetic enrichment and signal amplification. This immunosensor is integrated onto a microfluidic chip, which offers the advantages of minimal sample and reagent consumption, simplified sample handling, and enhanced detection sensitivity. The functionality of this immunosensor was validated by using it to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, which could be detected at concentrations as low as 50 pg/mL in whole serum and 10 pg/mL in 5× diluted serum. We also adapted this assay onto a handheld smartphone-based diagnostic device that could detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein at concentrations as low as 230 pg/mL in whole serum and 100 pg/mL in 5× diluted serum. Lastly, we assessed the capability of this immunosensor to diagnose COVID-19 infection by testing clinical serum specimens, which revealed its ability to accurately distinguish PCR-positive COVID-19 patients from healthy, uninfected individuals based on SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein serum levels. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first demonstration of rapid (<1 h) SARS-CoV-2 antigen quantification in whole serum samples. The ability to rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 protein biomarkers with high sensitivity in very small (<50 µL) serum samples makes this platform a promising tool for point-of-care COVID-19 testing.","Li, Jiran; Lillehoj, Peter B",ACS Sens,,453
345158,Environmental impacts of nanofluids: A review,2020,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is the commonest medium vessel vasculitis in children. The etiology of KD remains an enigma despite extensive research. Infections are considered to be one of the triggers for KD, especially in genetically susceptible hosts. KD occurring within a short time interval among siblings is an important clinical observation supporting this hypothesis. In addition, siblings of children with KD are at a higher risk of developing the disease as compared with other children. Screening for KD in febrile siblings, therefore, seems prudent. This would help initiate timely therapy and prevent complications. We briefly review 16 English language reports of KD in siblings diagnosed within 1 month of each other to highlight its etiological and therapeutic implications. Key Points â¢ KD should be suspected in febrile children who have a sibling recently diagnosed with KD. â¢ Etiological studies should also focus on siblings who develop KD in close temporal proximity.","Banday, Aaqib Zaffar; Bhattacharya, Deepanjan; Pandiarajan, Vignesh; Singh, Surjit",Clin. rheumatol,,453

The restrictions imposed across countries on the movement of people and the realignment of health care services in response to the pandemic are likely to negatively affect the health status and delivery of mental health services to persons with dual disorders (PWDD). Methods: An online survey was conducted among mental health professionals involved in providing care to PWDD to better understand the problems encountered and identify potential solutions in providing continued treatment for PWDD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The findings confirmed significant disruption in the delivery of treatment services for PWDD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dissatisfaction with personal protective equipment, inadequate COVID-19 testing services at treatment facility, and lack of guidelines on providing continued treatment services to PWDD by national authorities or professional bodies were identified as the likely reasons for this disruption. Conclusions: These concerns in turn need to be addressed by the policy-makers, hospital management staff, and other stakeholders. Specifically, there should be a focus on developing and disseminating guidelines to assist mental health professionals in setting-up and providing continued treatment services to PWDD via tele-psychiatry and other novel digital strategies.","Singh Balhara, Yatan Pal; Szerman, Nestor; Singh, Swarndeep; Martinez Raga, Jose; Salom, Caroline; Peris, Lola; Ganesh, Ragul",J Dual Diagn,,453

Thus, the purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive and systematic national assessment of the prevalence of depression and anxiety in the adult US population. METHODS: A multi-item, valid and reliable questionnaire was deployed online via mTurk and social media sites to recruit adult US participants in the general population across the USA. A total of 1978 individuals participated in the study, where the majority were: females (51%), whites (74%), non-Hispanic (81%), married (56%), employed full time (68%) and with a bachelor's degree or higher (78%). RESULTS: The prevalence of depression (39%), anxiety (42%) and psychological distress (39%) were computed from the PHQ-4 scale. In multiple regression analyses, depression, anxiety and psychological distress burden (assessed by PHQ-4 scale) was predicted significantly based on race, ethnicity, age, having children at home, employment as a healthcare worker, annual household income and area of residence. Males were more likely to have depression, and females were more likely to have anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Given the high prevalence of depression and anxiety, interdisciplinary and multisectoral approaches are recommended in the USA along with population-based interventions on mental health improvement.","Khubchandani, Jagdish; Sharma, Sushil; Webb, Fern J; Wiblishauser, Michael J; Bowman, Sharon L",J. public health (Oxf),,453

We analyzed the severity of COVID-19 across all 20 Italian regions.METHOD: We manually retrieved the daily cumulative numbers of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths attributed to COVID-19 in each region, and estimated the crude case fatality ratio and time delay-adjusted case fatality ratio (aCFR). We then assessed the association between aCFR and sociodemographic, health care and transmission factors using multivariate regression analysis.RESULTS: The overall aCFR in Italy was estimated at 17.4%. Lombardia exhibited the highest aCFR (24.7%), followed by Marche (19.3%), Emilia Romagna (17.7%) and Liguria (17.6%). Our aCFR estimate was greater than 10% for 12 regions. Our aCFR estimates were statistically associated with population density and cumulative morbidity rate in a multivariate analysis.CONCLUSION: Our aCFR estimates for Italy as a whole and for seven out of the 20 regions exceeded those reported for the most badly affected region in China.

Although African governments and other stakeholders are making efforts to contain the pandemic, the outbreak continues to impact human rights and exacerbates inequalities and disparities that are already in existence. The concept of inclusive health focuses on good health and well-being for everyone, and this entails health services that are equitable, affordable, and efficacious. Creating equitable access to mainstream health and healthcare services and ensuring inclusive health responses remain a means of addressing health inequities and disparities. In this article, we argue on the need for inclusive responses to public health emergencies in Africa using COVID-19 as a case example. Africa's response to public health emergencies needs to recognize that for every marginalized/vulnerable group, it is important to strategize to address their particular needs in such a way to surmount any barrier to the right to health. For Africa's public health response to be more inclusive, we therefore need to be more strategic and proactive in reaching out to specific groups and to identify and address their needs. Strengthening the healthcare systems of African countries through increased political will, increased funding to health care, collaboration and cooperation among stakeholders, and effective leadership remains essential in ensuring inclusive responses to health emergencies.","Adebisi, Yusuff Adebayo; Ekpenyong, Aniekan; Ntacyabukura, Blaise; Lowe, Mat; Jimoh, Nafisat Dasola; Abdulkareem, Toyyib Oladimeji; Lucero-Prisno, Don Eliseo",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,453

391021,Identifying vulnerable populations and transmission pathways by geographic correlation of the environment to human health,2021,"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Non-clinical studies suggest that chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have antiviral activities. Early clinical reports of successful HCQ-associated reduction in viral load from small studies in COVID-19 patients spurred a large number of national and international clinical trials to test their therapeutic potential. The objective of this review is to summarize the current evidence on the safety and efficacy of these two agents and to provide a perspective on why their repurposing has hitherto failed. METHODS: Published studies and rapidly emerging data were reviewed to gather evidence on safety and efficacy of CQ and HCQ in patients with COVID-19 infection or as prophylaxis. The focus is on clinically relevant efficacy endpoints and their adverse effects on QT interval. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: At the doses used, the two agents, given alone or with azithromycin (AZM), are not effective in COVID-19 infection. The choice of (typically subtherapeutic) dosing regimens, influenced partly by ""QT-phobia,"" varied widely and seems anecdotal without any pharmacologically reliable supporting clinical evidence. A substantial proportion of patients receiving CQ/HCQ/AZM regimen developed QTc interval prolongation, many with absolute QTc interval exceeding the potential proarrhythmic threshold, but very few developed proarrhythmia. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The strategy to repurpose CQ/HCQ to combat COVID-19 infection is overshadowed by concerns about their QT liability, resulting in choice of potentially subtherapeutic doses. Although the risk of QT-related proarrhythmia is real, it is low and manageable by careful monitoring. Recent discontinuation of HCQ from at least four large studies effectively marks the end of efforts at repurposing of CQ or HCQ for COVID-19 infection. This episode leaves behind important questions on dose selection and risk/benefit balance in repurposing drugs generally.","Shah, Rashmi R",J. clin. pharm. ther,,453

This study aimed to explore the rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity in saliva and gastrointestinal fluids to which endoscopy medical staff are exposed. METHODS: The study was a single-center cross-sectional study. From June 1 to July 31, 2020, all patients who underwent GIE at Yokohama City University Hospital were registered. All patients provided 3 ml of saliva. For upper GIE, 10 ml of gastric fluid was collected through the endoscope. For lower GIE, 10 ml of intestinal fluid was collected through the endoscope. The primary outcome was the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and gastrointestinal fluids. We also analyzed serum-specific antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 and patients' background information. RESULTS: A total of 783 samples (560 upper GIE and 223 lower GIE samples) were analyzed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on saliva samples did not show any positive results in either upper or lower GIE samples. However, 2.0% (16/783) of gastrointestinal fluid samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. No significant differences in age, sex, purpose of endoscopy, medication, or rate of antibody test positivity were found between PCR positive and PCR negative cases. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic patients, even those with no detectable virus in their saliva, had SARS-CoV-2 in their gastrointestinal tract.

The acute COVID-19 event can also impact activities of daily living and return to work;therefore COVID-19 can have lasting physical, emotional and social effects. Pulmonary rehabilitation services are well placed to provide the complex, multidisciplinary intervention required to treat the lasting effects of COVID-191, however the volume of patients requiring input is unknown. This study aims to explore the numbers of patients that self-identify a need for a rehabilitation intervention following discharge from hospital post COVID-19. Methods: Patients admitted to the University Hospitals of Leicester, UK between March and August 2020 were called by a healthcare professional following discharge to discuss lasting symptoms and offer a face to face rehabilitation assessment and intervention. Where it was not possible to contact patients, a letter was sent with contact details for patients to call back if they displayed ongoing symptoms. Patients that presented to hospital without a primary diagnosis of COVID and no respiratory symptoms were screened out and not contacted for the COVID rehabilitation pathway. Results: 938 patients who were discharged from the University Hospitals of Leicester between March and August 2020 were screened for rehabilitation. 37% (n=348) patients were deemed not appropriate (discharged to nursing home= 23, palliative=5, transferred out of area=18, incidental positive test without COVID symptoms= 127, not stated= 173). 13% (n=124) patients were not able to be contacted and did not return a call following postal contact. The mean [SD] time to telephone call was 32[18] days2. 50% (n=466) patients were assessed for ongoing symptoms and rehabilitation needs and 39% (n=184) of those assessed did not identify any rehabilitation needs. 61% (n=282) of patients assessed identified rehabilitation needs and were referred to a COVID rehabilitation program. The primary reported symptoms were fatigue, breathlessness, and limitations with activities of daily living2. Conclusion: 30% of patients discharged following COVID-19 identified rehabilitation needs. 37% of patients discharged were deemed unsuitable. Of those contacted, 61% identified ongoing symptoms that required a referral to rehabilitation, which places a burden on current pulmonary rehabilitation services. 1.Spruit, M., et al.

The primary objective of this investigation was to describe the point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) findings in patients evaluated in the emergency department (ED) who were diagnosed with MIS-C. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted including patients <21-years-old who had POCUS performed for clinical care in a pediatric ED and were diagnosed with MIS-C. Point-of-care ultrasound studies were performed by pediatric emergency medicine attending physicians or fellows. Data abstracted by chart review included patient demographics, clinical history, physical examination findings, diagnostic test results, the time POCUS studies and echocardiograms were performed, therapies administered, and clinical course after admission. RESULTS: For the 24 patients included, 17 focused cardiac ultrasound, 9 lung POCUS, 7 pediatric modified rapid ultrasound for shock and hypotension, 1 focused assessment with sonography for trauma, 1 POCUS for suspected appendicitis, and 1 ocular POCUS were performed by 13 physicians. Point-of-care ultrasound identified impaired cardiac contractility in 5 patients, large intraperitoneal free fluid with inflamed bowel in 1 patient, and increased optic nerve sheath diameters with elevation of the optic discs in 1 patient. Trace or small pericardial effusions, pleural effusions, and intraperitoneal free fluid were seen in 3 patients, 6 patients, and 4 patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the spectrum of POCUS findings in MIS-C. Prospective studies are needed to help delineate the utility of incorporating POCUS into an ED management pathway for patients with suspected MIS-C.","Kennedy, Thomas M; Dessie, Almaz; Kessler, David O; Malia, Laurie; Rabiner, Joni E; Firnberg, Maytal T; Ng, Lorraine",Pediatr Emerg Care,,453

RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the mental health symptoms in health-care providers (HCPs) facing the second wave? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study (October 30-December 1, 2020) was conducted in 16 ICUs during the second wave in France. HCPs completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (for post-traumatic stress disorder), and the Maslach Burnout Inventory. RESULTS: Of 1,203 HCPs, 845 responded (70%) (66% nursing staff, 32% medical staff, 2% other professionals); 487 (57.6%) had treated more than 10 new patients with COVID-19 in the previous week. Insomnia affected 320 (37.9%), and 7.7% were taking a psychotropic drug daily. Symptoms of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and burnout were reported in 60.0% (95% CI, 56.6%-63.3%), 36.1% (95% CI, 32.9%-39.5%), 28.4% (95% CI, 25.4%-31.6%), and 45.1% (95% CI, 41.7%-48.5%) of respondents, respectively. Independent predictors of such symptoms included respondent characteristics (sex, profession, experience, personality traits), work organization (ability to rest and to care for family), and self-perceptions (fear of becoming infected or of infecting family and friends, feeling pressure related to the surge, intention to leave the ICU, lassitude, working conditions, feeling they had a high-risk profession, and ""missing the clapping""). The number of patients with COVID-19 treated in the first wave or over the last week was not associated with symptoms of mental health disorders. INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of symptoms of mental health disorders is high in ICU HCPs managing the second COVID-19 surge. The highest tiers of hospital management urgently need to provide psychological support, peer-support groups, and a communication structure that ensure the well-being of HCPs.","Azoulay, Elie; Pochard, Frédéric; Reignier, Jean; Argaud, Laurent; Bruneel, Fabrice; Courbon, Pascale; Cariou, Alain; Klouche, Kada; Labbé, Vincent; Barbier, François; Guitton, Christophe; Demoule, Alexandre; Kouatchet, Achille; Guisset, Olivier; Jourdain, Mercé; Papazian, Laurent; Van Der Meersch, Guillaume; Reuter, Danielle; Souppart, Virginie; Resche-Rigon, Matthieu; Darmon, Michael; Kentish-Barnes, Nancy",Chest,,453

Initially in India, this disease was concentrated in major urban cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Gujarat, and Chennai, which were the national hotspots for the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in subsequent months, returning migrants (mainly day labour) brought the disease back to their home;this vector triggered significant spread to semi-urban and rural areas. This highlighted serious concerns in rural India, where access to sophisticated healthcare and mitigation strategies were lacking. There is little data on this new pattern of disease spread. This article provides a short review for tracking the spread of COVID-19 into major rural states in India based on understanding urban-rural workforce migration relative to the growing proportion of the nation's COVID-19 caseload between May-September 2020.","Sahoo, Prafulla Kumar Biswal Suchismita Kumar Hemant Powell Mike",The International Journal of Health Planning and Management,,453

442129,TEMPORARY REMOVAL: Non-English languages enrich scientific knowledge: The example of economic costs of biological invasions,2021,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are single-strand endogenous and non-coding RNA molecules with a length of about 22 nucleotides, which regulate genes expression, through modulating the translation and stability of their target mRNAs. miR-146a is one of the most studied miRNAs, due to its central role in immune system homeostasis and control of the innate and acquired immune responses. Accordingly, abnormal expression or function of miR-146a results in the incidence and progression of immune and non-immune inflammatory diseases. Its deregulated expression pattern and inefficient function have been reported in a wide spectrum of these illnesses. Based on the existing evidence, this miRNA qualifies as an ideal biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis, and activity evaluation of immune and non-immune inflammatory disorders. Moreover, much attention has recently been paid to therapeutic potential of miR-146a and several researchers have assessed the effects of different drugs on expression and function of this miRNA at diverse experimental, animal, besides human levels, reporting motivating results in the treatment of the diseases. Here, in this comprehensive review, we provide an overview of miR-146a role in the pathogenesis and progression of several immune and non-immune inflammatory diseases such as Rheumatoid arthritis, Systemic lupus erythematosus, Inflammatory bowel disease, Multiple sclerosis, Psoriasis, Graves' disease, Atherosclerosis, Hepatitis, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, etc., discuss about its eligibility for being a desirable biomarker for these disorders, and also highlight its therapeutic potential. Understanding these mechanisms underlies the selecting and designing the proper therapeutic targets and medications, which eventually facilitate the treatment process.","Mortazavi-Jahromi, Seyed Shahabeddin; Aslani, Mona; Mirshafiey, Abbas",Immunol Lett,,453

METHODS: OED reports of patients visited during lockdown (COVID-period) and in the corresponding period of 2017, 2018 and 2019 (COVID-free period) have been retrieved to draw a comparison. Patients' demographic and clinical data recorded and analysed are the following: age, gender, previous ocular history, aetiology, symptoms onset, type of symptoms, discharge diagnosis, urgency and severity of diagnosis. RESULTS: OED consultations dropped from 20.6 ± 7.3 visits/day of the COVID-free period to 8.6 ± 4.6 visits/day of the COVID-period. In the COVID-period patients waited longer before physically going to the OED, lamented more vision loss and less redness and reported a higher percentage of traumatic events when compared to the COVID-free period. A significant reduction of ocular surface conditions occurred, while vitreo-retinal disorders increased. Overall, both urgency and severity of diagnosed diseases raised significantly in the COVID-period. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic drove a significant reduction of the overall OED activity. People with less urgent and milder conditions preferred to wait and endure their ocular discomfort for a few days rather than leaving home and risking to contract the infection. Our analysis highlights how several times the OED is used improperly by patients diagnosed with non-urgent disorders. A more accurate use of the OED would allow a reduction of management costs and the avoidance of overcrowding, which can lead to delays in the care of patients that really need assistance.","Franzolin, Elia; Casati, Stefano; Albertini, Ottavia; Antonelli, Giulio; Marchetti, Pierpaolo; Bonora, Antonio; Marchini, Giorgio",Eur J Ophthalmol,,453

In response, the US government, utilizing the Defense Production Act ordered the development of 200,000 ventilators from 11 different manufacturers. These ventilators have different capabilities and it is not evident whether all are able to support COVID-19 patients. RESEARCH QUESTION: Evaluate ventilator requirements for affected COVID-19 patients, assess the clinical performance of current SNS ventilators employed during the pandemic, and finally compare ordered ventilators functionality based on COVID-19 patient needs. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Current published literature, publicly available documents, and lay press articles were reviewed by a diverse team of disaster experts. Data was assembled into tabular format which formed the basis for analysis and future recommendations. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients often develop severe hypoxemic acute respiratory failure and ARDS requiring high levels of ventilator support. Current SNS ventilators were unable to fully support all COVID-19 patients, and only about half of newly ordered ventilators have the capacity to support the most severely affected patients; ventilators with less capacity for providing high level support are still of significant value in caring for many patients. INTERPRETATION: Current SNS ventilators and those on order are capable of supporting most but not all COVID-19 patients. Technologic, logistic, and educational challenges encountered from current SNS ventilators are summarized, with potential next generation SNS ventilator updates offered.

Several studies have shown that marine organisms produce a variety of compounds, derived from primary or secondary metabolism, which may have antiviral activities. In particular, certain marine metabolites are active towards a plethora of viruses. Multiple mechanisms of action have been found, as well as different targets. This review gives an overview of the marine-derived compounds discovered in the last 10 years. Even if marine organisms produce a wide variety of different compounds, there is only one compound available on the market, Ara-A, and only another one is in phase I clinical trials, named Griffithsin. The recent pandemic emergency caused by SARS-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19, highlights the need to further invest in this field, in order to shed light on marine compound potentiality and discover new drugs from the sea.","Riccio, Gennaro; Ruocco, Nadia; Mutalipassi, Mirko; Costantini, Maria; Zupo, Valerio; Coppola, Daniela; de Pascale, Donatella; Lauritano, Chiara",Biomolecules,,453

This study aims to assess the asynchrony between individual behavior and government stay-at-home orders, quantify the true impact of social distancing using mobility data, and explore the sociodemographic variables linked to variation in social distancing practices. METHODS: This study was a retrospective investigation that leveraged mobility data to quantify the time to behavioral change in relation to the initial presence of COVID-19 and the implementation of government stay-at-home orders. The impact of social distancing that accounts for both individual behavior and testing data was calculated using generalized mixed models. The role of sociodemographics in accounting for variation in social distancing behavior was modeled using a 10-fold cross-validated elastic net (linear machine learning model). Analysis was conducted in AprilâJuly 2020. RESULTS: Across all the 1,124 counties included in this analysis, individuals began to socially distance at a median of 5 days (IQR=3-8) after 10 cumulative cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in their state, with state governments taking a median of 15 days (IQR=12-19) to enact stay-at-home orders. Overall, people began social distancing at a median of 12 days (IQR=8-17) before their state enacted stay-at-home orders. Of the 16 studies included in the review, 13 exclusively used government dates as a proxy for social distancing behavior, and none accounted for both testing and mobility. Using government stay-at-home dates as a proxy for social distancing (10.2% decrease in the number of daily cases) accounted for only 55% of the true impact of the intervention when compared with estimates using mobility (18.6% reduction). Using 10-fold cross-validation, 23 of 43 sociodemographic variables were significantly and independently predictive of variation in individual social distancing, with delays corresponding to an increase in a county's proportion of people without a high school diploma and proportion of racial and ethnic minorities. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective analysis of mobility patterns found that social distancing behavior occurred well before the onset of government stay-at-home dates. This asynchrony leads to the underestimation of the impact of social distancing. Sociodemographic characteristics associated with delays in social distancing can help explain the disproportionate case burden and mortality among vulnerable communities.","Abdalla, Moustafa; Abar, Arjan; Beiter, Evan R; Saad, Mohamed",Am. j. prev. med,,453

Quantitative models play an important role in understanding food systems' expected responses to shocks and stresses. Here, we present a stylised mathematical model of a national-level food system that incorporates domestic supply of a food commodity, international trade, consumer demand, and food commodity price. We derive a critical compound parameter signalling when domestic supply will become unsustainable and the food system entirely dependent on imports, which results in higher commodity prices, lower consumer demand and lower inventory levels. Using Bayesian estimation, we apply the dynamic food systems model to infer the sustainability of the UK pork industry. We find that the UK pork industry is currently sustainable but because the industry is dependent on imports to meet demand, a decrease in self-sufficiency below 50% (current levels are 60-65%) would lead it close to the critical boundary signalling its collapse. Our model provides a theoretical foundation for future work to determine more complex causal drivers of food system vulnerability.","Goold, Conor; Pfuderer, Simone; James, William H.

474850,Degradation of metoprolol from wastewater in a bio-electro-Fenton system,2021,"Whether and when to mandate the wearing of facemasks in the community to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 remains controversial. Published literature across disciplines about the role of masks in mitigating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission is summarized. Growing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is airborne indicates that infection control interventions must go beyond contact and droplet measures (such as handwashing and cleaning surfaces) and attend to masking and ventilation. Observational evidence suggests that masks work mainly by source control (preventing infected persons from transmitting the virus to others), but laboratory studies of mask filtration properties suggest that they could also provide some protection to wearers (protective effect). Even small reductions in individual transmission could lead to substantial reductions in population spread. To date, only 1 randomized controlled trial has examined a community mask recommendation. This trial did not identify a significant protective effect and was not designed to evaluate source control. Filtration properties and comfort vary widely across mask types. Masks may cause discomfort and communication difficulties. However, there is no evidence that masks result in significant physiologic decompensation or that risk compensation and fomite transmission are associated with mask wearing. The psychological effects of masks are culturally shaped; they may include threats to autonomy, social relatedness, and competence. Evidence suggests that the potential benefits of wearing masks likely outweigh the potential harms when SARS-CoV-2 is spreading in a community. However, mask mandates involve a tradeoff with personal freedom, so such policies should be pursued only if the threat is substantial and mitigation of spread cannot be achieved through other means.","Czypionka, Thomas; Greenhalgh, Trisha; Bassler, Dirk; Bryant, Manuel B",Ann. intern. med,,453
475961,COVID-19: Perspectives from Students Pursuing Plastic Surgery: Correction,2021,"Overabundant species can have major impacts on their habitat and induce trophic cascades within ecosystems. In North America, the overabundant greater snow goose (Anser caerulescens atlanticus) has been successfully controlled through special spring hunting regulations since 1999. Hunting is a source of mortality but also of disturbance, which affects the behavior and nutrient storage dynamics of staging snow geese. In 2020, the lockdown imposed by the COVID19 pandemic reduced hunting activity during their migratory stopover in Québec by at least 31%. This provided a unique opportunity to assess the effects of a sudden reduction in hunting disturbance on geese. We used long-term data on body mass combined with movement data from GPS-tracked birds in 2019 and 2020 to assess the effects of the 2020 lockdown on the spring body condition and behavior of greater snow geese. Body condition was higher in 2020 than in all years since the inception of spring hunting in 1999, except for 2019. However, in 2020 geese reached maximal body condition earlier during the staging period than in any other year and reduced by half time spent feeding in highly profitable but risky agricultural habitat in late spring compared to 2019. Although our study was not designed to evaluate the effects of the lockdown, the associated reduction in disturbance in 2020 supports the hypothesis that hunting-related disturbance negatively affects foraging efficiency and body condition in geese. Since spring body condition is related to subsequent breeding success, the lockdown could increase productivity in this overabundant population.","Frédéric, LeTourneux; Thierry, Grandmont; Frédéric, Dulude-de Broin; Marie-Claude, Martin; Josée, Lefebvre; Akiko, Kato; Joël, Bêty; Gilles, Gauthier; Pierre, Legagneux",Biol Conserv,,453

The therapeutic effect of the traditional Chinese medicine Lianhua Qingwen in this new coronary pneumonia epidemic has attracted attention from all walks of life, and relevant research reports continue to appear. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the clinical efficacy and safety of the traditional Chinese medicine Lianhua Qingwen in the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) (referred to as ""new coronary pneumonia""), and evaluated the overall level of research quality. METHODS: We searched seven databases and retrieved the Chinese Journal Full-text Database (CNKI), Vip Database (VIP), China Biomedicine (SinoMed), Wanfang Database and PubMed, Cochrane Central, EMBASE from October 2019 to May 2020 Literature references. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that tested the efficacy of the traditional Chinese medicine lotus clearing plague in the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia. The authors extracted data and independently assessed quality. We used Stata15.1 software to analyze the data of randomized trials. RESULTS: A total of 2 articles were identified, including 154 patients. All the participating patients were diagnosed with new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). The meta-analysis results showed that the disappearance rate of the main clinical symptoms of Chinese medicine Lianhua Qingwen in the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia was significantly higher than that of the control group [OR = 3.34, 95% CI (2.06, 5.44), P <0.001]; the disappearance rate of other clinical secondary symptoms is significantly higher than the control group [OR = 6.54, 95% CI (3.59, 11.90), P <0.001]. The duration of fever was significantly lower than that of the control group [OR = -1.04, 95% CI (-1.60, -0.49), P <0.001]. It is confirmed that the traditional Chinese medicine Lianhua Qingwen treatment improves the clinical effectiveness, and also has certain advantages in relieving cough and fever. CONCLUSION: The treatment of new pneumonia with traditional Chinese medicine lotus clearing plague can be used as an effective therapy to improve the clinical symptoms of new coronary pneumonia. More rigorous design, multi-center, and prospective RCTs are necessary to further determine the effectiveness and safety of the traditional Chinese medicine lotus decoction in the treatment of new pneumonia.","Zeng, Mengjie; Li, Linjun; Wu, Zhiquan",PLoS One,,453

Despite the rapidly increasing number of cases in subsequent weeks, the clinical characteristics of pediatric cases are rarely described. A cross-sectional multicenter study was carried out in 10 hospitals across Hubei province. A total of 25 confirmed pediatric cases of COVID-19 were collected. The demographic data, epidemiological history, underlying diseases, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiological data, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed. Of 25 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the boy to girl ratio was 1.27:1. The median age was 3 years. COVID-19 cases in children aged <3 years, 3.6 years, and &#8805;6-years patients were 10 (40%), 6 (24%), and 9 (36%), respectively. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (13 [52%]), and dry cough (11 [44%]). Chest CT images showed essential normal in 8 cases (33.3%), unilateral involvement of lungs in 5 cases (20.8%), and bilateral involvement in 11 cases (45.8%). Clinical diagnoses included upper respiratory tract infection (n=8), mild pneumonia (n=15), and critical cases (n=2). Two critical cases (8%) were given invasive mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids, and immunoglobulin. The symptoms in 24 (96%) of 25 patients were alleviated and one patient had been discharged. It was concluded that children were susceptible to COVID-19 like adults, while the clinical presentations and outcomes were more favorable in children. However, children less than 3 years old accounted for majority cases and critical cases lied in this age group, which demanded extra attentions during home caring and hospitalization treatment.","Zheng, Fang; Liao, Chun; Fan, Qi-Hong; Chen, Hong-Bo; Zhao, Xue-Gong; Xie, Zhong-Guo; Li, Xi-Lin; Chen, Chun-Xi; Lu, Xiao-Xia; Liu, Zhi-Sheng; Lu, Wei; Chen, Chun-Bao; Jiao, Rong; Zhang, Ai-Ming; Wang, Jin-Tang; Ding, Xi-Wei; Zeng, Yao-Guang; Cheng, Li-Ping; Huang, Qing-Feng; Wu, Jiang; Luo, Xi-Chang; Wang, Zhu-Jun; Zhong, Yan-Yan; Bai, Yan; Wu, Xiao-Yan; Jin, Run-Ming",Curr Med Sci,,453

Lockdowns, however, have been associated with a deterioration of mental health, including post-traumatic stress symptoms, anger and anxiety. Exposure to nature might reduce stress and provide relaxation opportunities. OBJECTIVE: Firstly, we aimed to determine which sociodemographic, housing and lockdown-related characteristics were associated with changes in exposure to nature during the COVID-19 lockdown in Portugal and Spain. Secondly, we sought to estimate the associations of these changes with mental health, and test whether these associations differed according to sociodemographic characteristics and between the two countries, which experienced different restrictions and epidemiological situations. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between March 27 and May 6, 2020, using an online questionnaire to measure changes in exposure to nature (including private green space and other greenery, views of nature from home and public natural spaces); sociodemographic, housing and lockdown-related characteristics; stress levels (visual stress scale); psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire - 12 items) and somatization (somatization scale). Adjusted regression models were fitted to estimate associations. RESULTS: This study included 3157 participants (1638 from Portugal, 1519 from Spain). In Portugal, maintaining/increasing the use of public natural spaces during the lockdown was associated with lower levels of stress (adjusted beta -0.29; 95%CI -0.49, -0.08) and maintaining/increasing the frequency of viewing nature from home was associated with reduced psychological distress (0.27; -0.51, -0.03), somatization (-0.79; -1.39, -0.20), and stress levels (-0.48; -0.74, -0.23). In Spain, maintaining/increasing contact with private green space and greenery was associated with lower stress levels: for contact with indoor plants (-0.52; -0.96, -0.07) and for use of private community green spaces (-0.82; -1.61, -0.03). CONCLUSION: Exposure to nature was associated with better mental health outcomes during lockdowns, but the natural features associated with improved mental health differed between the two countries. Nature should be incorporated into urban planning interventions and housing design and exposure to nature should be promoted during lockdowns.","Ribeiro, Ana Isabel; Triguero-Mas, Margarita; Jardim Santos, Cláudia; Gómez-Nieto, Alicia; Cole, Helen; Anguelovski, Isabelle; Silva, Filipa Martins; Baró, Francesc",Environ Int,,453

In all-comer patients, contemporary DES have shown excellent safety and efficacy, but data on diabetic patients are scarce. Separately for the BIO-RESORT and BIONYX trials, we assessed the 2-year clinical outcomes of diabetic patients, treated with various contemporary drug-eluting stents (DES). METHODS: We performed two prespecified secondary analyses of two randomized DES trials, which both stratified for diabetes. The main endpoint was target vessel failure (TVF), a composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization. Follow-up was finished before the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: In BIO-RESORT, 624/3514 (17.8%) had diabetes: 211 received Orsiro sirolimus-eluting stents (SES), 203 Synergy everolimus-eluting stents (EES), and 210 Resolute Integrity zotarolimus-eluting stents (RI-ZES). TVF did not differ between SES (10.2%) and EES (10.0%) versus RI-ZES (12.7%) (SES vs. RI-ZES HR:0.78, 95%-CI [0.44-1.40]; p = 0.40, EES vs. RI-ZES HR:0.79, 95%-CI [0.44-1.40]; p = 0.42). In BIONYX, 510/2488 (20.5%) patients had diabetes: 250 received SES and 260 Resolute Onyx zotarolimus-eluting stents (RO-ZES). There was no difference in TVF between SES (10.7%) versus RO-ZES (12.2%) (HR:0.88, 95%-CI [0.52-1.48]; p = 0.63). CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in 2-year clinical outcome among patients with diabetes, who were treated with SES, or EES, versus RI-ZES. In addition there was no difference in clinical outcome in diabetic patients, who were treated with SES versus RO-ZES. These findings may be considered as a signal of safety and efficacy of the studied DES in patients with diabetes.","Ploumen, Eline H; Buiten, Rosaly A; Kok, Marlies M; Doggen, Carine J M; Roguin, Ariel; Jessurun, Gillian A J; Schotborgh, Carl E; Danse, Peter W; Benit, Edouard; Aminian, Adel; van Houwelingen, K Gert; Stoel, Martin G; Scholte, Martijn; Hartmann, Marc; Linssen, Gerard C M; Zocca, Paolo; von Birgelen, Clemens",Int. j. cardiol,,453

505164,Controlling virus droplets diffusion in an isolated room using CFD,2021,"BackgroundOver recent years chronic stress and burnout have been reported by doctors working in general practice in the UK NHS and internationally. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed general practitioners working lives - adding potential pressures from avoiding infection and addressing pent-up demand for care, but also changing processes such as rapidly taking up remote consultations. To date, there has been a focus on exploring the impact of the pandemic on the wellbeing of hospital clinicians. No registered systematic reviews currently focus on exploring the impact of the pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of general practitioners. Aims and objectivesTo synthesise the current international evidence base exploring the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and wellbeing of general practitioners, and which factors are associated with their reported mental health and wellbeing during the pandemic. MethodsIn this paper we report a systematic review protocol, following PRISMA guidance. In our search strategy we will identify primary research studies or systematic reviews exploring the mental health and wellbeing of general practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic in four databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsychInfo and Medrxiv) and Google Scholar. We will hand-search reference lists and grey literature. Two reviewers will undertake all stages including study selection, data extraction and quality assessment, with arbitration by a third reviewer where necessary. We will use standardised quality assessment tools to ensure transparency and reduce bias in quality assessment. Depending on the quality of included studies, we may undertake a sensitivity analysis by excluding studies from narrative synthesis that are rated as low quality using the checklists. We will describe the findings across studies using narrative thematic data synthesis, and if sufficiently homogenous data are identified, we will pool quantitative findings through meta-analysis.","Jefferson, Laura; Golder, Su; Dale, Veronica; Essex, Holly; McHugh, Elizabeth; Bloor, Karen",,,453

NTDs have remained largely unnoticed in the global health agenda. There is a substantial gap between the burden of disease for NTDs in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and research devoted to the affected populations. We created a Latin-American initiative with emerging leaders (EL) from the Interamerican Society of Cardiology (IASC) with the objective to perform multiple systematic reviews of NTDs and other infectious diseases affecting the heart: The NET-Heart Project. Objective: To describe the rationale and design considerations of the NET-Heart project. Methods: The NET-Heart Project is a collaborative work of the IASC EL program. The main objective of the NET-Heart project is to systematically evaluate the available evidence of NTDs and other infectious diseases and their cardiovascular involvement. As a secondary objective, this initiative aims to offer recommendations and potential diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms that can aid the management of cardiovascular complications of these infectious diseases. After an expert discussion 17 initial infectious diseases were selected, for each disease we created one working group. The project was structured in different phases: Systematic review, brainstorming workshops, analysis and results, manuscript writing and recommendations and evaluation of clinical implications. Conclusion: The NET-Heart project is an innovative collaborative initiative created to assess burden and impact of NTDs and other infectious diseases in CVD. NTDs can no longer be ignored and must be prioritised on the health and research agenda. This project aims to review in depth the evidence regarding cardiac compromise of these serious conditions and to propose strategies to overcome barriers for efficient diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular complications.","Burgos, Lucrecia M; Farina, Juan; Liendro, Macarena Cousirat; Saldarriaga, Clara; Liprandi, Alvaro Sosa; Wyss, Fernando; Mendoza, Ivan; Baranchuk, Adrian",Glob Heart,,453
520935,COVID-19: Perspectives from Students Pursuing Plastic Surgery,2021,"COVID-19 caused rapid mass infection worldwide. Understanding its transmission characteristics, including heterogeneity and the emergence of super spreading events (SSEs) where certain individuals infect large numbers of secondary cases, is of vital importance for prediction and intervention of future epidemics. Here, we collected information of all infected cases (135 cases) between 21 January and 26 February 2020 from official public sources in Tianjin, a metropolis of China, and grouped them into 43 transmission chains with the largest chain of 45 cases and the longest chain of four generations. Utilizing a heterogeneous transmission model based on branching process along with a negative binomial offspring distribution, we estimated the reproductive number R and the dispersion parameter k (lower value indicating higher heterogeneity) to be 0.67 (95% CI: 0.54-0.84) and 0.25 (95% CI: 0.13-0.88), respectively. A super-spreader causing six infections was identified in Tianjin. In addition, our simulation allowing for heterogeneity showed that the outbreak in Tianjin would have caused 165 infections and sustained for 7.56 generations on average if no control measures had been taken by local government since 28 January. Our results highlighted more efforts are needed to verify the transmission heterogeneity of COVID-19 in other populations and its contributing factors.","Zhang, Yunjun; Li, Yuying; Wang, Lu; Li, Mingyuan; Zhou, Xiaohua",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,453

We outline our deployment of a virtual tabletop simulation (TTS) method in primary care (PC) clinics across Alberta, Canada. We summarise the quality and safety improvements from this method and report end users’ perspectives on key elements. METHODS: Our virtual TTS used teleconferencing software alongside digital whiteboards to walk clinic stakeholders through patient scenarios. Participants reviewed and rehearsed their workflows and care practices. The goal was for staff to take ownership over gaps and codesigned solutions. After simulation sessions, follow-up interviews were conducted to collect feedback. RESULTS: These sessions helped PC staff identify and codesign solutions for clinical hazards and threats. These included the flow of patients through clinics, communications, redesignation of physical spaces, and adaptation of guidance for cleaning and personal protective equipment use. End users reported sessions provided neutral spaces to discuss practice changes and built confidence in delivering safe care during the pandemic. DISCUSSION: TTS has not been extensively deployed to improve clinical practice in outpatient environments. We show how virtual TTS can bridge gaps between knowledge and practice by offering a guided space to rehearse clinical changes. We show that virtual TTS can be used in multiple contexts to help identify hazards, improve safety and build confidence in professional teams adapting to rapid changes in both policies and practices. While our sessions were conducted in Alberta, our results suggest this method may be deployed in other contexts, including low-resource settings.","Blaak, Marlot Johanna; Fadaak, Raad; Davies, Jan M; Pinto, Nicole; Conly, John; Leslie, Myles",BMJ Simul Technol Enhanc Learn,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjstel-2020-000854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34422296/,453

However, the detection rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS_CoV_2) RNA from different clinical specimens after onset of symptoms is not yet well established. For guiding the selection of specimens for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, a systematic review aiming at profiling the positive detection rate from different clinical specimens using PCR was conducted. Methods: The systematic search was done using PubMed/MEDLINE, Science direct, Google Scholar, among others. The search included studies on laboratory diagnosis of SARS_CoV_2 from different clinical specimens using PCR. Data extraction was done using Microsoft Excel spread sheet 2010 and reported according to PRISMA_P guidelines. Using Open Meta Analyst software, DerSimonian_Laird random effects analysis was performed to determine a summary estimate (positive rate [PR]/proportions) and their 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Results: A total of 8136 different clinical specimens were analyzed to detect SARS_CoV_2, with majority being nasopharyngeal swabs (69.6%). Lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens had a PR of 71.3% (95%CI:60.3%-82.3%) while no virus was detected from the urinogenital specimens. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BLF) specimen had the PR of 91.8% (95%CI:79.9-103.7%), followed by rectal swabs, 87.8 % (95%CI:78.6%-96.9%) then sputum, 68.1% (95%CI:56.9%-79.4%). Low PR was observed in oropharyngeal swabs, 7.6% (95%CI:5.7%-9.6%) and blood samples, 1.0% (95%CI: -0.1%-2.1%), whilst no SARS-CoV-2 was detected in urine samples. Nasopharyngeal swab, a widely used specimen had a PR of 45.5% (95%CI:31.2%-59.7%). Conclusion: In this study, SARS-CoV-2 was highly detected in lower respiratory tract specimens while there was no detected virus in urinogenital specimens. Regarding the type of clinical specimens, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid had the highest positive rate followed by rectal swab then sputum. Nasopharyngeal swab which is widely used had a moderate detection rate. Low positive rate was recorded in oropharyngeal swab and blood sample while no virus was found in urine samples.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective single-center study selected 91 patients who had chest CT and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test collected at the same day. CT results were classified in negative, typical, indeterminate or atypical findings. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were calculated for two different scenarios: in the first, only typical findings on CT were considered positive; in the second, both typical and indeterminate findings were considered positive. RESULTS: Mean patients’ age was 58.2 years, most were male (60.4%) and had prior diagnosis of cancer (85.7%). CT showed typical findings in 28.6%, indeterminate findings in 24.2% and atypical findings in 26.4%. RT-PCR results were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 27.5%. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in the first and second scenarios were respectively 64.0%, 84.8% and 79.1%, and 92.0%, 62.1% and 70.3%. CONCLUSION: CT has a high accuracy for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Different interpretation criteria can provide either high sensitivity or high specificity. CT should be integrated as a triage test in resource-constrained environments during the pandemic to assist in the optimization of PCR-tests, isolation beds and intensive care units.","Barbosa, Paula Nicole Vieira Pinto; Bitencourt, Almir Galvão Vieira; de Miranda, Gabriel Diaz; Almeida, Maria Fernanda Arruda; Chojniak, Rubens",Radiol Bras,https://doi.org/10.1590/0100-3984.2020.0040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32904703/,453

We describe the epidemiological and laboratory data from one of the first such outbreaks in Ontario to assess factors associated with its severity, and the impact of progressive interventions for infection control over the course of the outbreak. METHODS: We obtained line list and outbreak data from the public health unit to describe resident and staff cases, severity and distribution of cases over time and within the outbreak facility. Where available, we obtained data on laboratory specimens from the Public Health Ontario Laboratory and performed whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of viral specimens from the outbreak. RESULTS: Among 65 residents of the long-term care home, 61 (94%) contracted SARS-CoV-2, with a case fatality rate of 45% (28/61). Among 67 initial staff, 34 (51%) contracted the virus and none died. When the outbreak was declared, 12 staff, 2 visitors and 9 residents had symptoms. Resident cases were located in 3 of 4 areas of the home. Phylogenetic analysis showed tight clustering of cases, with only 1 additional strain of genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 identified from a staff case in the third week of the outbreak. No cases were identified among 26 new staff brought into the home after full outbreak measures were implemented. INTERPRETATION: Rapid and undetected viral spread in a long-term care home led to high rates of infection among residents and staff. Progressive implementation of outbreak measures after the peak of cases prevented subsequent staff cases and are now part of long-term care outbreak policy in Ontario.","Murti, Michelle; Goetz, Monika; Saunders, Andrea; Sunil, Vidya; Guthrie, Jennifer L.; Eshaghi, AliReza; Zittermann, Sandra; Teatero, Sarah; Fittipaldi, Nahuel; Rilkoff, Heather; Gubbay, Jonathan B.; Garber, Gary; Callery, Sandra; Holt, Anne Marie; Noseworthy, A.

614921,Mitteilungen der DGKFO,2020-06-25,"INTRODUCTION: Sigmoid volvulus (SV) occurs due to torsion of a dilated sigmoid colon around its mesenteric axis. This causes venous and arterial blood flow obstruction with progressive bowel ischemia, necrosis, and perforation if left untreated. In pediatric surgical practice volvulus of the sigmoid colon remains a rare occurrence and only a few isolated case reports and case series have been reported. The author presents herein a case of SV in a 19-year-old male. CASE REPORT: A 19-year-old male was presented to the emergency service of our hospital complaining of abdominal pain, constipation, nausea, and vomiting for 4 days. Radiologic imaging showed the features of the sigmoid volvulus. Endoscopic detorsion was applied and the patient underwent elective surgery for anterior sigmoid resection to prevent the recurrence. DISCUSSION: Sigmoid volvulus, first described by von Rokitansky in 1836 and remains a major cause of colonic intestinal obstruction in adults, which results from twisting of the sigmoid colon on its mesentery. The median age in children at presentation is 7 years, ranging from 4 h to 18 years. CONCLUSION: Sigmoid volvulus is an uncommon cause of bowel obstruction in teenagers and should be included in the differential diagnosis of young patients present with abdominal pain and absolute constipation. Early diagnosis and timely definitive treatment can prevent complications. Endoscopic detorsion is the initial treatment of choice in the absence of complications. However, elective surgery with sigmoid resection and primary anastomosis is mandatory to prevent a recurrence.","Esmat, Habib Ahmad",Int J Surg Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33395915/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2020.11.152,453

METHODS: This was a cohort study with retrospective comparison of 14,780 in-person encounters and 2,589 telehealth encounters, including 2,093 audio-video telemedicine and 496 scheduled telephone encounters, between October 1, 2019 and April 24, 2020. We compared in-person and telehealth encounters for patient demographics and diagnoses. For audio-video telemedicine encounters, we analyzed questionnaire responses addressing provider experience, follow-up plans, technical quality, need for in-person assessment, and parent/caregiver satisfaction. We performed manual reviews of encounters flagged as concerning by providers. RESULTS: There were no differences in patient age and major ICD-10 codes before and after transition. Clinicians considered telemedicine satisfactory in 93% (1,200 of 1,286) of encounters and suggested telemedicine as a component for follow-up care in 89% (1,144 of 1,286) of encounters. Technical challenges were reported in 40% (519 of 1,314) of encounters. In-person assessment was considered warranted after 5% (65 of 1,285) of encounters. Patients/caregivers indicated interest in telemedicine for future care in 86% (187 of 217) of encounters. Participation in telemedicine encounters compared to telephone encounters was less frequent among patients in racial or ethnic minority groups. CONCLUSIONS: We effectively converted most of our outpatient care to telehealth encounters, including mostly audio-video telemedicine encounters. Providers rated the vast majority of telemedicine encounters to be satisfactory, and only a small proportion of encounters required short-term in-person follow-up. These findings suggest that telemedicine is feasible and effective for a large proportion of child neurology care. Additional strategies are needed to ensure equitable telemedicine use.","Rametta, Salvatore C.; Fridinger, Sara E.; Gonzalez, Alexander K.; Xian, Julie; Galer, Peter D.; Kaufman, Michael; Prelack, Marisa S.; Sharif, Uzma; Fitzgerald, Mark P.; Melamed, Susan E.; Malcolm, Marissa P.; Kessler, Sudha Kilaru; Stephenson, Donna J.; Banwell, Brenda L.; Abend, Nicholas S.; Helbig, Ingo",Neurology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32518152/; https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000010010,453

Particular attention was paid to where these trajectories involved the use of formal healthcare facilities and the diagnostic practices that occurred there. Seventy-six participants were enrolled in the study, and 24 complete episodes of illness were documented. While participants routinely used hospital treatment when confronted with enduring or severe illness, the diagnostic process within clinical settings meant that an unusual diagnosis, such as an EID, was unlikely to be considered. Facility-based surveillance is unlikely to be effective in detecting EIDs due to a combination of clinical care practices and the time constraints associated with individual episodes of illness, particularly in the resource-limited settings of rural West Africa, where febrile illness due to malaria is common and specific diagnostic assays are largely unavailable. The success of the ‘One Health' approach to EIDs in West Africa is predicated on characterization of accurately diagnosed disease burdens. To this end, we must address inefficiencies in the dominant approaches to EID surveillance and the weaknesses of health systems in the region generally. This article is part of the themed issue ‘One Health for a changing world: zoonoses, ecosystems and human well-being'.","Jephcott, Freya L.; Wood, James L.

To identify new candidates we screened a repurposing library of ~3,000 drugs. Screening in Vero cells found few antivirals, while screening in human Huh7.5 cells validated 23 diverse antiviral drugs. Extending our studies to lung epithelial cells, we found that there are major differences in drug sensitivity and entry pathways used by SARS-CoV-2 in these cells. Entry in lung epithelial Calu-3 cells is pH-independent and requires TMPRSS2, while entry in Vero and Huh7.5 cells requires low pH and triggering by acid-dependent endosomal proteases. Moreover, we found 9 drugs are antiviral in lung cells, 7 of which have been tested in humans, and 3 are FDA approved including Cyclosporine which we found is targeting Cyclophilin rather than Calcineurin for its antiviral activity. These antivirals reveal essential host targets and have the potential for rapid clinical implementation.","Dittmar, Mark; Lee, Jae Seung; Whig, Kanupriya; Segrist, Elisha; Li, Minghua; Jurado, Kellie; Samby, Kirandeep; Ramage, Holly; Schultz, David; Cherry, Sara",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.19.161042,453

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented selection of this cost-effective treatment of ocular surface squamous neoplasia (the use of absolute ethanol along the corneal margin, primary excision, double freeze-thaw cryopexy, and primary conjunctival closure) for an undocumented and uninsured New York City patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old man from Ecuador presented to a New York City emergency department due to worsening discomfort of a long-standing left eye pterygium. A slit-lamp examination of the left eye demonstrated a nasally located conjunctival mass measuring 6 × 8 mm extending onto the cornea (3 mm superiorly and 6 mm inferiorly on the cornea). Histological diagnosis confirmed squamous cell carcinoma in situ arising from the pterygium. Surgical excision with adjunctive absolute alcohol with additive double freeze-thaw cryopexy was performed. Our patient has remained free of tumor recurrence at year 2 postoperative visit. CONCLUSIONS: Our case highlights the need to choose a cost-effective treatment for ocular surface squamous neoplasia in an at-risk population among undocumented and uninsured patients.

Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 4(5), 277–293. Background There is a requirement to detect and differentiate pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (H1N1v) and established swine influenza A viruses (SIVs) by real time reverse transcription (RRT) PCR methods. Objectives First, modify an existing matrix (M) gene RRT PCR for sensitive generic detection of H1N1v and other European SIVs. Second, design an H1 RRT PCR to specifically detect H1N1v infections. Methods RRT PCR assays were used to test laboratory isolates of SIV (n = 51; 37 European and 14 North American), H1N1v (n = 5) and avian influenza virus (AIV; n = 43). Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were calculated for swabs (n = 133) and tissues (n = 116) collected from field cases and pigs infected experimentally with SIVs and H1N1v. Results The “perfect match” M gene RRT PCR was the most sensitive variant of this test for detection of established European SIVs and H1N1v. H1 RRT PCR specifically detected H1N1v but not European SIVs. Validation with clinical specimens included comparison with virus isolation (VI) as a “gold standard”, while field infection with H1N1v in swine was independently confirmed by sequencing H1N1v amplified by conventional RT PCR. “Perfect match” M gene RRT PCR had 100% sensitivity and 95·2% specificity for swabs, 93·6% and 98·6% for tissues. H1 RRT PCR demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 99·1%, respectively, for the swabs, and 100% and 100% for the tissues. Conclusions Two RRT PCRs for the purposes of (i) generic detection of SIV and H1N1v infection in European pigs, and for (ii) specific detection of H1N1v (pandemic influenza) infection were validated.","Slomka, Marek J.; Densham, Anstice L.

Background: Known to impact bone cell behavior, surface chemical and topography modifications target improved osseointegration and long-term success of dental implants. Very few studies assess the performance of implants presenting both micro-and nanofeatures in vivo on the animal models used in preclinical studies for medical device certification. Methods: Implant surfaces were characterized in terms of topography and surface chemical composition. After 4 weeks and 13 weeks of implantation in sheep femoral condyles, forty implants were evaluated through micro-computed tomography, histopathologic, and histomorphometric analyses. Results: No local adverse effects were observed around implants. Histomorphometric analyses showed significantly higher bone-to-implant contact in the coronal region of the surface treated implant at week 4 and week 13, respectively 79.3$\pm$11.2% and 86.4$\pm$6.7%, compared to the untreated implant's 68.3$\pm$8.8% and 74.8$\pm$13%. Micro-computed tomography analyses revealed that healing patterns differed between coronal and apical regions, with higher coronal boneto-implant contact at week 13. Histopathologic results showed, at week 13, bone healing around the surface treated implant with undistinguishable defect margins while the untreated implant still presented bone condensation and traces of the initial drill defect. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the surface treated implant not only shows no deleterious effects on local tissues but also promotes faster bone healing around the implant.

During entry, viruses or virus-containing vesicles can fuse with endosomal membranes to mediate the cytosolic release of virions, and alterations in endosomal cholesterol can inhibit this invasion step. We show that the antiviral effector protein Interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) interacts with VAPA and prevents its association with OSBP, thereby disrupting intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and inhibiting viral entry. By altering VAPA-OSBP function, IFITM3 induces a marked accumulation of cholesterol in multivesicular bodies and late endosomes, which inhibits the fusion of intraluminal virion-containing vesicles with endosomal membranes and thereby blocks virus release into the cytosol. Consequently, ectopic expression or depletion of the VAPA gene profoundly affects IFITM3-mediated inhibition of viral entry. Thus, IFITM3 disrupts intracellular cholesterol homeostasis to block viral entry, further underscoring the importance of cholesterol in virus infection.","Amini-Bavil-Olyaee, Samad; Choi, Youn Jung; Lee, Jun Han; Shi, Mude; Huang, I-Chueh; Farzan, Michael; Jung, Jae U.",Cell Host & Microbe,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23601107/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2013.03.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312813001169; http://www.cell.com/article/S1931312813001169/pdf; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312813001169,453

The health sector was hit hard by this war, up to 50% of the health facilities have been destroyed and up to 70% of the healthcare providers fled the country seeking safety, which increased the workload and mental pressure for the remaining medical staff. Five databases were searched and 438 articles were included according to the inclusion criteria, the articles were divided into categories according to the topic of the article. Through this review, the current health status of the Syrian population living inside Syria, whether under governmental or opposition control, was reviewed, and also, the health status of the Syrian refugees was examined according to each host country. Public health indicators were used to summarize and categorize the information. This research reviewed mental health, children and maternal health, oral health, non-communicable diseases, infectious diseases, occupational health, and the effect of the COVID − 19 pandemic on the Syrian healthcare system. The results of the review are irritating, as still after ten years of war and millions of refugees there is an enormous need for healthcare services, and international organization has failed to respond to those needs. The review ended with the current and future challenges facing the healthcare system, and suggestions about rebuilding the healthcare system. Through this review, the major consequences of the Syrian war on the health of the Syrian population have been reviewed and highlighted.

STUDY DESIGN: This was an observational cohort study in two primary care pediatric practices in Madison, WI. Nasal samples were obtained during 4 asymptomatic surveillance visits and during symptomatic URIs. A polymerase chain reaction-based assay for 9 respiratory viruses was performed on nasal samples. A diagnosis of sinusitis was based on published criteria. RESULTS: 236 children ages 48-96 months were enrolled. A total of 327 URIs were characterized. The mean number of URIs per child was 1.3 (range 0-9) per year. Viruses were detected in 81% of URIs; rhinovirus (RV) was most common. Seventy-two percent of URIs were resolved clinically by the tenth day. RV-A and RV-C were detected more frequently at URI visits; RV-B was detected at the same rate for both asymptomatic surveillance visits and URI visits. Sinusitis was diagnosed in 8.8% of symptomatic URIs. Viruses were detected frequently (33%) in samples from asymptomatic children. CONCLUSIONS: Sinusitis occured in 8.8% of symptomatic URIs in our study. The virus most frequently detected with URIs in children was RV; RV-A and RV-C detection but not RV-B detection were associated with illness. Viruses, especially RV, are detected frequently in asymptomatic children. Most URIs have improved or resolved by the tenth day after onset. Children experienced a mean of 1.3 URIs per year which was lower than expected.","DeMuri, Gregory P.; Gern, James E.; Moyer, Stacey C.; Lindstrom, Mary J.; Lynch, Susan V.; Wald, Ellen R.",The Journal of Pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26787374/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4808614?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022347615016224; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022347615016224; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2015.12.034,453

Immunogenicity of biologics in context(),2009-09-30,"Global containment of COVID-19 still requires accessible and affordable vaccines for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Recently approved vaccines provide needed interventions, albeit at prices that may limit their global access. Subunit vaccines based on recombinant proteins are suited for large-volume microbial manufacturing to yield billions of doses annually, minimizing their manufacturing cost. These types of vaccines are well-established, proven interventions with multiple safe and efficacious commercial examples. Many vaccine candidates of this type for SARS-CoV-2 rely on sequences containing the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which mediates viral entry to cells via ACE2. Here we report an engineered sequence variant of RBD that exhibits high-yield manufacturability, high-affinity binding to ACE2, and enhanced immunogenicity after a single dose in mice compared to the Wuhan-Hu-1 variant used in current vaccines. Antibodies raised against the engineered protein exhibited heterotypic binding to the RBD from two recently reported SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (501Y.V1/V2). Presentation of the engineered RBD on a designed virus-like particle (VLP) also reduced weight loss in hamsters upon viral challenge.","Dalvie, Neil C; Rodriguez-Aponte, Sergio A; Hartwell, Brittany L; Tostanoski, Lisa H; Biedermann, Andrew M; Crowell, Laura E; Kaur, Kawaljit; Kumru, Ozan S; Carter, Lauren; Yu, Jingyou; Chang, Aiquan; McMahan, Katherine; Courant, Thomas; Lebas, Celia; Lemnios, Ashley A; Rodrigues, Kristen A; Silva, Murillo; Johnston, Ryan S; Naranjo, Christopher A; Tracey, Mary Kate; Brady, Joseph R; Whittaker, Charles A; Yun, Dongsoo; Brunette, Natalie; Wang, Jing Yang; Walkey, Carl; Fiala, Brooke; Kar, Swagata; Porto, Maciel; Lok, Megan; Andersen, Hanne; Lewis, Mark G; Love, Kerry R; Camp, Danielle L; Silverman, Judith Maxwell; Kleanthous, Harry; Joshi, Sangeeta B; Volkin, David B; Dubois, Patrice M; Collin, Nicolas; King, Neil P; Barouch, Dan H; Irvine, Darrell J; Love, J Christopher",Proc.

Methods: Environmental and health data were collected for the 16 years around the refinery closure. Toronto (2.5 million persons) and the Greater Toronto Area (GTA, 6.3 million persons) were used as control and reference populations, respectively, for Oakville (160,000 persons). We compared sulfur dioxide and age- and season-standardized hospitalizations, considering potential factors such as changes in demographics, socio-economics, drug prescriptions, and environmental variables. Results: The closure of the refinery eliminated 6000 tons/year of SO(2) emissions, with an observed reduction of 20% in wind direction-adjusted ambient concentrations in Oakville. After accounting for trends, a decrease in cold-season peak-centered respiratory hospitalizations was observed for Oakville (reduction of 2.2 cases/1000 persons per year, [Formula: see text]) but not in Toronto (p = 0.856) and the GTA (p = 0.334). The reduction of respiratory hospitalizations in Oakville post closure appeared to have no observed link to known confounders or effect modifiers.

Aging affects males and females differently, but how perinatal stress (PRS) affects brain aging between sexes is unknown. We showed behavioral and neurobiological sex differences in non-stressed control rats that were strongly reduced or inverted in PRS rats. In particular, PRS decreased risk-taking behavior, spatial memory, exploratory behavior, and fine motor behavior in male aged rats. In contrast, female aged PRS rats displayed only increased risk-taking behavior and reduced exploratory behavior. PRS induced large reductions in the expression of glutamate receptors in the ventral and dorsal hippocampus and prefrontal cortex only in male rats. PRS also reduced the expression of synaptic vesicle-associated proteins, glucocorticoid receptors (GR), and mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) in the ventral hippocampus of aged male rats. In contrast, in female aged rats, PRS enhanced the expression of MRs and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the ventral hippocampus and the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and BDNF in the prefrontal cortex. A common PRS effect in both sexes was a reduction in exploratory behavior and metabotropic glutamate (mGlu2/3) receptors in the ventral hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. A multidimensional analysis revealed that PRS induced a demasculinization profile in glutamate-related proteins in the ventral and dorsal hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, as well as a demasculinization profile of stress markers only in the dorsal hippocampus. In contrast, defeminization was observed only in the ventral hippocampus. Measurements of testosterone and 17-β-estradiol in the plasma and aromatase in the dorsal hippocampus were consistent with a demasculinizing action of PRS. These findings confirm that the brains of males and females differentially respond to PRS and aging suggesting that females might be more protected against early stress and age-related inflammation and neurodegeneration. Taken together, these results may contribute to understanding how early environmental factors shape vulnerability to brain aging in both sexes and may lay the groundwork for future studies aimed at identifying new treatment strategies to improve the quality of life of older individuals, which is of particular interest given that there is a high growth of aging in populations around the world.

653093,Mitteilungen der DGU,2020-12-07,"As witnessed over the last year, immunity emerged as one of most highly debated topics in the current Covid-19 pandemic. Countries around the globe have been debating whether herd immunity or lockdown is the best response, as the race continues for the development and rollout of effective vaccines against coronavirus and as the economic costs of implementing strict containment measures are weighed against public health costs. What became evident all the more is that immunity is precisely what bridges between biological life and political life in the current climate, be it in terms of the contentious notion of herd immunity, the geopolitical struggle for vaccines, or the possible emergence of “Covid-elite”, i.e. holders of so-called “immunity passports”. Immunity, as such, is certainly not only a matter of science and biology alone, but is inherently political in the way that pandemics themselves are often highly politicised. Drawing on the work of Roberto Esposito and other literature from the field of biopolitics and immunology, this paper provides a critical examination of the concept of immunity in light of the recent events, highlighting the intersections between the politics of defence and the politics of sacrifice which animate governments’ immunitary responses to the Covid-19 pandemic. The paper ends with a discussion on the forms of solidarity and local initiatives that have been mobilised during the current pandemic and their potential for an affirmative form of biopolitics. Overall, the main aim of this paper is to provide a critical cultural and philosophical analysis of Covid-19 debates and responses and a nuanced account on the biopolitical effects of the current pandemic, highlighting the paradoxical nature of immunity which straddles at once negative practices of defence and sacrifice as well as affirmative forms of community and solidarity beyond state apparatuses.","Ajana, Btihaj",Hist Philos Life Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40656-021-00384-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33616771/,453

Daily data was collected on a range of containment and closure policies for 186 countries from January 1, 2020 until March 11(th), 2021. These data were combined into an aggregate stringency index (SI) score for each country on each day (range: 0–100). Countries were divided into successive waves via a mathematical algorithm to identify peaks and troughs of disease. Within our period of analysis, 63 countries experienced at least one wave, 40 countries experienced two waves, and 10 countries saw three waves, as defined by our approach. Within each wave, regression was used to assess the relationship between the strength of government stringency and subsequent deaths related to COVID-19 with a number of controls for time and country-specific demographic, health system, and economic characteristics. Across the full period of our analysis and 113 countries, an increase of 10 points on the SI was linked to 6 percentage points (P < 0.001, 95% CI = [5%, 7%]) lower average daily deaths. In the first wave, in countries that ultimately experiences 3 waves of the pandemic to date, ten additional points on the SI resulted in lower average daily deaths by 21 percentage points (P < .001, 95% CI = [8%, 16%]). This effect was sustained in the third wave with reductions in deaths of 28 percentage points (P < .001, 95% CI = [13%, 21%]). Moreover, interaction effects show that government policies were effective in reducing deaths in all waves in all groups of countries. These findings highlight the enduring importance of non-pharmaceutical responses to COVID-19 over time.","Hale, Thomas; Angrist, Noam; Hale, Andrew J.; Kira, Beatriz; Majumdar, Saptarshi; Petherick, Anna; Phillips, Toby; Sridhar, Devi; Thompson, Robin N.; Webster, Samuel; Zhang, Yuxi",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34242239/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253116,453

There is no specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19, and the use of Remdesivir for treating COVID-19 will likely continue before clinical trials are completed. Due to the lengthening pandemic and evolving nature of the virus, predicting potential residues prone to mutations is crucial for the management of Remdesivir resistance. We used a rational ligand-based interface design complemented with mutational mapping to generate a total of 100,000 mutations and provide insight into the functional outcome of mutations in the Remdesivir-binding site in nsp12. After designing 56 residues in the Remdesivir binding site of nsp12, the designs retained 96-98% sequence identity, which suggests that SARS-CoV-2 attains resistance and develops further infectivity with very few mutations in the nsp12. We also identified affinity-attenuating Remdesivir binding designs of nsp12. Several mutants acquired decreased binding affinity with Remdesivir, which suggested drug resistance. These hotspot residues had a higher probability of undergoing selective mutations in the future to develop Remdesivir and related drug-based resistance. A comparison of 21 nsp12 Remdesivir-bound designs to the 13 EIDD-2801-bound nsp12 designs suggested that EIDD-2801 would be more effective in preventing the emergence of resistant mutations and against Remdesivir-resistance strains due to the restricted mutational landscape. Combined with the availability of more genomic data, our information on mutation repertoires is critical to guide scientists to rational structure-based drug discovery. Knowledge of the potential residues prone to mutation improves our understanding and management of drug resistance and disease pathogenesis.","Padhi, Aditya K.; Shukla, Rohit; Tripathi, Timir",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.27.174896,453

Globally confirmed infections have surpassed 41.1 million, of which more than 1 million resulted in deaths. Considering the relationship between public health disasters and emotional disorders, it is essential to examine psychological well-being related to this pandemic. METHOD: We performed a systematic search on psychological problems from PubMed to 10 October 2020, and conducted a meta-analysis using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis V.3 software. RESULTS: The results showed a 19.4% and 26.8% pooled incidence for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), respectively, during the SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-related coronavirus outbreaks. However, overall prevalence of depression was somewhat higher at 27.0% during the COVID-19 period. The pooled incidence of PTSD during COVID-19 compared with SARS and MERS outbreaks, was lower, at 16.4%. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that there are shared and distinct psychological responses following SARS, MERS and COVID-19, and show pessimistic estimates of a wide range of potentially upcoming psychological problems.","Fan, Fang Cheng; Zhang, Shu Yao; Cheng, Yong",J Epidemiol Community Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33632722/; https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-215927,453

It is highly dependent on accurate identification and delineation of the volume of interest to avoid mistakes in the implementation of the texture-based prediction model. In this context, we present a customized deep learning approach aimed at addressing the real-time, and fully automated identification and segmentation of COVID-19 infected regions in computed tomography images. METHODS In a previous study, we adopted ENET, originally used for image segmentation tasks in self-driving cars, for whole parenchyma segmentation in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis which has several similarities to COVID-19 disease. To automatically identify and segment COVID-19 infected areas, a customized ENET, namely C-ENET, was implemented and its performance compared to the original ENET and some state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. RESULTS The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Considering the performance obtained in terms of similarity of the result of the segmentation to the gold standard (dice similarity coefficient ~75%), our proposed methodology can be used for the identification and delineation of COVID-19 infected areas without any supervision of a radiologist, in order to obtain a volume of interest independent from the user. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated that the proposed customized deep learning model can be applied to rapidly identify, and segment COVID-19 infected regions to subsequently extract useful information for assessing disease severity through radiomics analyses.","Stefano, Alessandro; Comelli, Albert",Journal of imaging,https://doi.org/10.3390/jimaging7080131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34460767/,453

Parmi elles, des phénomènes d’acrosyndromes ont été décrits, principalement chez des patients suspects d’infection par SARS-Cov-2 mais asymptomatiques ou pauci-symptomatiques. Peu d’études se sont intéressées à ces manifestations chez les patients admis en réanimation. Notre objectif était donc d’évaluer la fréquence instantanée des manifestations acrales cutanées chez les patients sévères atteints de la COVID19 admis en réanimation. Matériel et méthodes Nous avons réalisé une étude observationnelle et prospective, réalisée du 5 au 6 mai 2020. Tout patient adulte hospitalisé en réanimation au CHU de Lille dans le cadre de la COVID19 était inclus et bénéficiait d’un examen systématique du tégument par un dermatologue sénior. Résultats Au total, 39 patients ont été examinés (34 hommes, 5 femmes) avec un âge moyen de 60,6 ans. Aucun patient n’avait présenté de symptôme dermatologique au début de la maladie. La durée médiane d’hospitalisation en réanimation était de 35jours [21-41] ; 35 patients (90 %) avaient reçu un support ventilatoire par intubation oro-trachéale et 21 (54 %) un support circulatoire par amines vasopressives. Nous avons observé des manifestations cutanées acrales chez 11 patients (28 %) : lésions nécrotiques (5/11, 45 %), bulles hémorragiques (3/11, 27 %), livedo (1/11, 9 %), érosions (1/11, 9 %), hémorragies sous unguéales (2/11, 18 %). Un patient présentant à la fois des lésions nécrotiques et des érosions cutanées. Aucun patient ne présentait de manifestations à type d’engelure ou pseudo-engelure. Il n’y avait pas de différence significative entre les patients avec et sans manifestation acrale concernant la durée d’hospitalisation et les complications thromboemboliques, les symptômes initiaux, et les caractéristiques de base des patients excepté l’IMC moyen plus bas chez les patients avec manifestations acrales. La durée moyenne de la maladie était significativement plus longue et davantage de médicaments vasoactifs ont été administrés aux patients présentant des manifestations cutanées acrales, suggérant une gravité plus élevée de la maladie dans ce groupe et pouvant être en lien avec les manifestations observées. Discussion Nous rapportons une série de manifestations cutanées acrales chez seulement 28 % des patients pris en charge en réanimation au moment de l’étude. Ces manifestations sont variées et peu spécifiques. Aucune manifestation à type d’engelure n’était observée contrairement aux patients suspects de formes pauci ou asymptomatiques et inconstamment confirmées sur le plan sérologique ou moléculaire.

Ein soziologischer Deutungsversuch der Corona-Krise",2020-11-18,"INTRODUCTION: In vitro fertilisation (IVF) has evolved as an intervention of choice to help couples with infertility to conceive. In the last decade, a strategy change in the day of embryo transfer has been developed. Many IVF centres choose nowadays to transfer at later stages of embryo development, for example, transferring embryos at blastocyst stage instead of cleavage stage. However, it still is not known which embryo transfer policy in IVF is more efficient in terms of cumulative live birth rate (cLBR), following a fresh and the subsequent frozen–thawed transfers after one oocyte retrieval. Furthermore, studies reporting on obstetric and neonatal outcomes from both transfer policies are limited. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We have set up a multicentre randomised superiority trial in the Netherlands, named the Three or Fivetrial. We plan to include 1200 women with an indication for IVF with at least four embryos available on day 2 after the oocyte retrieval. Women are randomly allocated to either (1) control group: embryo transfer on day 3 and cryopreservation of supernumerary good-quality embryos on day 3 or 4, or (2) intervention group: embryo transfer on day 5 and cryopreservation of supernumerary good-quality embryos on day 5 or 6. The primary outcome is the cLBR per oocyte retrieval. Secondary outcomes include LBR following fresh transfer, multiple pregnancy rate and time until pregnancy leading a live birth. We will also assess the obstetric and neonatal outcomes, costs and patients’ treatment burden.

Participants: Patients under 18 years of age who are infected by the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus (confirmed diagnosis through reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction [RT‐PCR]) while under treatment at pediatric oncology centers. The variables of interest included clinical symptoms, diagnostic and therapeutic measures. The repercussions of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection on cancer treatment and general prognosis were monitored. RESULTS: One hundred seventy‐nine patients were included (median age 6 [4–13] years, 58% male). Of these, 55.9% had acute leukemia and 34.1% had solid tumors. The presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 was diagnosed by RT‐PCR. Various laboratory markers were analyzed, but showed no correlation with outcome.

Subsequently, we systematically compared the potential similarities and discrepancy both at the cellular and molecular levels via flow cytometry, multilineage differentiation, chromosome karyotyping, cytokine quantification, and transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis including single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), gene ontology (GO), HeatMap, principal component analysis (PCA), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). RESULTS: On the one hand, AML-MSCs exhibited undistinguishable signatures in cytomorphology, surface biomarker expression pattern, stemness, chromosome karyotype, and chondrogenesis as HD-MSCs, whereas with impaired adipogenesis, enhanced osteogenesis, and variations in cytokine expression pattern. On the other hand, with the aid of genomic and bioinformatic analyses, we verified that AML-MSCs displayed multidimensional discrepancy with HD-MSCs both in genome-wide gene expression profiling and genetic variation spectrum. Simultaneously, the deficiency of cellular vitality including proliferation and apoptosis in AML-MSCs was largely rescued by JAK-STAT signaling inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings elucidated that AML-MSCs manifested multifaceted alterations in biological signatures and molecular genetics, and in particular, the deficiency of cellular vitality ascribed to over-activation of JAK-STAT signal, which collectively provided systematic and overwhelming new evidence for decoding the pathogenesis of AML and exploring therapeutic strategies in future.

679557,Transition to Web-based Interviews for Residency Programs during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2020-07-13,"INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the use of text messages to communicate information to patients whose surgeries were postponed because of the COVID-19 restriction on elective surgeries. Our hypothesis was that text messaging would be an effective way to convey updates. METHODS: In this observational study, 295 patients received text messaging alerts. Eligibility included patients who had their surgery postponed and had a cell phone that received text messages. Engagement rates were determined using embedded smart links. Patient survey responses were collected. RESULTS: A total of 3,032 texts were delivered. Engagement rates averaged 90%. Survey responses (n = 111) demonstrated that 98.2% of patients liked the text messages and 95.5% said that they felt more connected to their care team; 91.9% of patients agreed that the text updates helped them avoid calling the office. Patients with higher pain levels reported more frustration with their surgery delay (5.3 versus 2.8 on 1 to 10 scale, P value < 0.01). More frustrated patients wished they received more text messages (24.4% versus 4.6%, P value = 0.04) and found the content less helpful (8.2 versus 9.2 on 1 to 10 scale, P value = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Text messaging updates are an efficient way to communicate with patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Campbell, Kevin J.; Blackburn, Brenna E.; Erickson, Jill A.; Pelt, Christopher E.; Anderson, Lucas A.; Peters, Christopher L.; Gililland, Jeremy M.",J Am Acad Orthop Surg Glob Res Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34128913/,453
682380,Managing biofilm growth and clogging to promote sustainability in an intermittent sand filter (ISF),2020-09-26,"IMPORTANCE: The COVID-19 pandemic has delayed medical consultations, possibly leading to the diagnosis of gastrointestinal cancer at advanced stages. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate stage at diagnosis among patients with gastrointestinal cancer in Japan before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included patients in a hospital-based cancer registry who were diagnosed with gastrointestinal cancer (ie, esophageal, gastric, colorectal, pancreatic, liver, and biliary tract cancers) between January 2016 and December 2020 at 2 tertiary Japanese hospitals. EXPOSURES: The pre–COVID-19 period was defined as January 2017 to February 2020, and the COVID-19 period was defined as March 2020 to December 2020. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Monthly numbers of patients with newly diagnosed cancer were aggregated, classified by stage, and compared. RESULTS: The study evaluated 5167 patients, including 4218 patients (2825 [67.0%] men; mean [SD] age, 71.3 [10.9] years) in the pre–COVID-19 period and 949 patients (607 [64.0%] men; mean [SD] age, 71.8 [10.7] years) in the COVID-19 period. Comparing the pre–COVID-19 period with the COVID-19 period, significant decreases were observed in the mean (SD) number of patients with newly diagnosed gastric cancer (30.63 [6.62] patients/month vs 22.40 [5.85] patients/month; –26.87% change; P < .001) and colorectal cancer (41.61 [6.81] patients/month vs 36.00 [6.72] patients/month; –13.47% change; P = .03). Significant decreases were also observed in the mean (SD) number of cases of stage I gastric cancer (21.55 [5.66] cases/month vs 13.90 [5.99] cases/month; –35.51% change; P < .001), stage 0 colorectal cancer (10.58 [3.36] cases/month vs 7.10 [4.10] cases/month; –32.89% change; P = .008), and stage I colorectal cancer (10.16 [3.14] cases/month vs 6.70 [2.91] cases/month; –34.04% change; P = .003). No significant increases were observed for esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, liver, or biliary tract cancers. A significant decrease was observed in the mean (SD) number of cases per month of stage II colorectal cancer (7.42 [3.06] cases/month vs 4.80 [1.75] cases/month; –35.32% change; P = .01); a significant increase was observed for the mean (SD) number of cases per month of stage III colorectal cancer (7.18 [2.85] cases/month vs 12.10 [2.42] cases/month; 68.42% change; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of patients in a hospital-based cancer registry form Japan, significantly fewer patients were diagnosed with stage I gastric and colorectal cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the number of screening-detected cancers might have decreased, and colorectal cancer may have been diagnosed at more advanced stages.","Kuzuu, Kento; Misawa, Noboru; Ashikari, Keiichi; Kessoku, Takaomi; Kato, Shingo; Hosono, Kunihiro; Yoneda, Masato; Nonaka, Takashi; Matsushima, Shozo; Komatsu, Tatsuji; Nakajima, Atsushi; Higurashi, Takuma",JAMA Netw Open,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.26334; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34546368/,453
683152,The relationship between cyclonic weather regimes and seasonal influenza over the Eastern Mediterranean,2020-08-12,"Hypericum perforatum L., also known as Saint John’s Wort, has been well studied for its chemical composition and pharmacological activity. In this study, the antiviral activities of H. perforatum on infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were evaluated in vitro and in vivo for the first time. The results of in vitro experiments confirmed that the antiviral component of H. perforatum was ethyl acetate extraction section (HPE), and results showed that treatment with HPE significantly reduced the relative messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression and virus titer of IBV, and reduced positive green immunofluorescence signal of IBV in chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells. HPE treatment at doses of 480–120 mg/kg for 5 days, reduced IBV induced injury in the trachea and kidney, moreover, reduced the mRNA expression level of IBV in the trachea and kidney in vivo. The mRNA expression levels of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) significantly decreased, but melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), mitochondrial antiviral signaling gene, interferon alpha (IFN-α), and interferon beta (IFN-β) mRNA levels significantly increased in vitro and in vivo. Our findings demonstrated that HPE had significant anti-IBV effects in vitro and in vivo, respectively. In addition, it is possible owing to up-regulate mRNA expression of type I interferon through the MDA5 signaling pathway and down-regulate mRNA expression of IL-6 and TNF-α via the NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, the mainly active compositions of HPE analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization–mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS) are hyperoside, quercitrin, quercetin, pseudohypericin, and hypericin, and a combination of these compounds could mediate the antiviral activities. This might accelerate our understanding of the antiviral effect of H. perforatum and provide new insights into the development of effective therapeutic strategies.","Chen, Huijie; Muhammad, Ishfaq; Zhang, Yue; Ren, Yudong; Zhang, Ruili; Huang, Xiaodan; Diao, Lei; Liu, Haixin; Li, Xunliang; Sun, Xiaoqi; Abbas, Ghulam; Li, Guangxing",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31736754/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2019.01272,453
686010,Wastewater surveillance for population-wide Covid-19: The present and future,2020-05-23,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: After the official coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic declaration by the WHO, Italy had the second-largest number of confirmed cases, after China. The Italian government introduced progressive infection-mitigation measurements, thus dramatically reducing social interactions and preventing virus spread. During the summer, infection containment measures progressively loosened until, due to an unjustified interpretation of some permissions and the excessive utilization of public transportation at school reopening, the contagion rate progressively increased until causing a severe challenge for our NHS again. Aim of the study: to assess the efficiency of our previously described protocol in 18 Campania region-located Nefrocenter Consortium DCs as further adapted to new knowledge under the new ubiquitous contagion conditions and to identify SARS-CoV-2-infection mortality rate and risk factors. METHOD: Dialysis patients did so too during that period according to the expected shifting prevalence over time (mean ± SD: 853 ± 30 per month; range 825 to 873) ± (11.8% in April, and 14.8% in November vs. a pre-COVID-19 12.0% rate in January). RESULTS: More patients got infected in November (10.19%) than in April (0,24%), and 22 patients of the 89 from the SARS-CoV-2 November positive subjects required hospitalization for moderate-severe symptoms (24.72%), with death unavoidably coming in 19 (86.36% of hospitalized and 21.35% of infected patients) compared to the only one recorded in April (0.12%). The pandemic's two periods showed a strong association between mortality rate and often co-existing comorbidities, primarily represented by arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). CONCLUSION: The prevously efficient contagion containment measures adopted by our DCs were not enough in November to fight the global infection risk pending on the whole Italian social community around.

The SARS-CoV-2 main protease, or Mpro, is a promising target for development of novel antiviral therapeutics. Previous X-ray crystal structures of Mpro were obtained at cryogenic temperature or room temperature only. Here we report a series of high-resolution crystal structures of unliganded Mpro across multiple temperatures from cryogenic to physiological, and another at high humidity. We interrogate these datasets with parsimonious multiconformer models, multi-copy ensemble models, and isomorphous difference density maps. Our analysis reveals a temperature-dependent conformational landscape for Mpro, including a mobile water interleaved between the catalytic dyad, mercurial conformational heterogeneity in a key substrate-binding loop, and a far-reaching intramolecular network bridging the active site and dimer interface. Our results may inspire new strategies for antiviral drug development to counter-punch COVID-19 and combat future coronavirus pandemics.","Ebrahim, Ali; Riley, Blake T.; Kumaran, Desigan; Andi, Babak; Fuchs, Martin R.; McSweeney, Sean; Keedy, Daniel A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.03.437411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33972941/,453
