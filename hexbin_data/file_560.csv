8467,Safe treatment of health-care workers with Ebola,2017-12-13,"Ion transport in the jejunal mucosa of 14- to 16-day-old piglets with severe diarrhea 40hr after infection with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus was studied. In infected pigs Na(+) transport failed to. respond normally to glucose when studied either in Ussing short-circuited chambers or in suspensions of enterocytes isolated selectively from jejunal villi. Theophylline, 10 mm, added to the chambers produced the same brisk electrical responses and increments in net Cl(−) secretion in tissue from both infected and control groups. A defect in glucose-stimulated Na(+) absorption in the acute stage of a viral enteritis has been identified which probably contributes to the impaired lumen-to-extracellular fluid flux of Na(+) found previously in the jejunum of intact TGE-infected pigs. The mechanisms causing diarrhea in this invasive viral enteritis differ from those causing toxigenic diarrhea.","McClung, H.J.; Butler, D.G.; Kerzner, B.; Gall, D.G.; Hamilton, J.R.",Gastroenterology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130178/,560

13016,The Need to Develop Standard Measures of Patient Adherence for Big Data: Viewpoint,2020-08-27,"BACKGROUND: During the outbreak, billions of people were eager to get information about COVID-19 through social media. Social media can not only deliver reliable information to the public but can in turn reflect changes in the public’s psychological status. Insight into the public’s hotspots of concern and mental status through media background tools contributes to the formulation of public health policies and the clarification of epidemic development mode. METHODS: WeChat is the largest social media in China. Taking the recovery period of COVID-19 in China, for example, we collected WeChat Index data and analyzed the public’s concern about the course of COVID-19 and the restoration of emotional tendency through keywords search. RESULTS: With the gradual control of the COVID-19 in China, the public psychological status changes from negative to neutral, accompanied by a weakening of negative emotions and an increase in positive emotions. Every obvious inflection point of improvement in social operation is reflected in the increase of public attention and the relaxation of lifestyle. CONCLUSIONS: Social media can be used to monitor the public psychological status and the development mode and trend of infection in one country during a pandemic.","Jia, Fei; Liu, Xiaoguang",J Public Health (Oxf),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7499652/,560

14802,Rural Emergency Medical Service Providers Perceptions on the Causes of and Solutions to the Opioid Crisis: A Qualitative Assessment,2021-01-11,"OBJECTIVES: Understanding the level of investment needed for the 2021-2030 decade is important as the global community faces the next strategic period for vaccines and immunization programs. To assist with this goal, we estimated the aggregate costs of immunization programs for ten vaccines in 94 low- and middle-income countries from 2011 to 2030. METHOD: We calculated vaccine, immunization delivery and stockpile costs for 94 low- and middle-income countries leveraging the latest available data sources. We conducted scenario analyses to vary assumptions about the relationship between delivery cost and coverage as well as vaccine prices for fully self-financing countries. RESULTS: The total aggregate cost of immunization programs in 94 countries for 10 vaccines from 2011 to 2030 is $70.8 billion (confidence interval: $56.6-$93.3) under the base case scenario and $84.1 billion ($72.8-$102.7) under an incremental delivery cost scenario, with an increasing trend over two decades. The relative proportion of vaccine and delivery costs for pneumococcal conjugate, human papillomavirus, and rotavirus vaccines increase as more countries introduce these vaccines. Nine countries in accelerated transition phase bear the highest burden of the costs in the next decade, and uncertainty with vaccine prices for the 17 fully self-financing countries could lead to total costs that are 1.3-13.1 times higher than the base case scenario. CONCLUSION: Resource mobilization efforts at the global and country levels will be needed to reach the level of investment needed for the coming decade. Global-level initiatives and targeted strategies for transitioning countries will help ensure the sustainability of immunization programs.","Sim, So Yoon; Watts, Elizabeth; Constenla, Dagna; Huang, Shuoning; Brenzel, Logan; Patenaude, Bryan N.",Value Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7813215/,560

The primary aim of this comparative observational study was to evaluate if pre-operative IN reduces in-hospital stay in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resection for cancer under an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) program. The influence of IN on time to first bowel movements, time to full oral diet tolerance, number and type of complications, reasons of prolonged LOS and readmission rate was evaluated as secondary outcome. Patients undergoing ERAS laparoscopic colorectal resection between December 2016 and December 2019 were reviewed. Patients who have received preoperative IN (group A) were compared to those receiving standard dietary advice (group B). Mean in-hospital LOS was significantly shorter in patients receiving preoperative IN than standard dietary advice (4.85 ± 2.25 days vs. 6.06 ± 3.95 days; p < 0.0492). No differences in secondary outcomes were observed. Preoperative IN associated with ERAS protocol in normo-nourished patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection seems to reduce LOS.","Tesauro, Manfredi; Guida, Andrea M.; Siragusa, Leandro; Sensi, Bruno; Bellato, Vittoria; Di Daniele, Nicola; Divizia, Andrea; Franceschilli, Marzia; Sica, Giuseppe S.",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7865842/,560
16168,Online therapy: an added value for inpatient routine care? Perspectives from mental health care professionals,2021-03-16,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to investigate the time course of syndecan-1 (Syn-1) plasma levels, the correlation between Syn-1 and organ damage development, and the associations of Syn-1 level with cumulative fluid balance and ventilator-free days (VFD) in patients with septic shock. METHODS: We collected blood samples from 38 patients with septic shock upon their admission to ICU and for the first 7 days of their stay. Syn-1 plasma level, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), other organ damage, VFD, and cumulative fluid balance were assessed daily. RESULTS: Over the course of 7 days, Syn-1 plasma levels increased significantly more in patients with ARDS than in those without ARDS. Patients with high levels of Syn-1 in the 72 h after ICU admission had significantly higher cumulative fluid balance, lower PaO(2)/FiO(2), and fewer VFD than patients with low levels of Syn-1. Syn-1 levels did not correlate with sequential organ failure assessment score or with APACHE II score. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of patients with septic shock, higher circulating level of Syn-1 of cardinal glycocalyx component is associated with more ARDS, cumulative positive fluid balance, and fewer VFD. Measurement of Syn-1 levels in patients with septic shock might be useful for predicting patients at high risk of ARDS.

16359,Oxygen management among infants in neonatal units in sub-Saharan Africa: a cross-sectional survey,2021-03-26,"The gut microbiome plays a major role in the maintenance of human health. Characterizing the taxonomy and metabolic functions of the human gut microbiome is necessary for enhancing health. Here, we analyzed the metagenomic sequencing, assembly and construction of a meta-gene catalogue of the human gut microbiome with the overall aim of investigating the taxonomy and metabolic functions of the gut microbiome in Thai adults. As a result, the integrative analysis of 16S rRNA gene and whole metagenome shotgun (WMGS) sequencing data revealed that the dominant gut bacterial families were Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae of the Firmicutes phylum. Consistently, across 3.8 million (M) genes annotated from 163.5 gigabases (Gb) of WMGS sequencing data, a significant number of genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism of the dominant bacterial families were identified. Further identification of bacterial community-wide metabolic functions promisingly highlighted the importance of Roseburia and Faecalibacterium involvement in central carbon metabolism, sugar utilization and metabolism towards butyrate biosynthesis. This work presents an initial study of shotgun metagenomics in a Thai population-based cohort in a developing Southeast Asian country.","Raethong, Nachon; Nakphaichit, Massalin; Suratannon, Narissara; Sathitkowitchai, Witida; Weerapakorn, Wanlapa; Keawsompong, Suttipun; Vongsangnak, Wanwipa",Genes (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7996147/,560

Hemostatic efficacy and reversal of anti-FXa activity with andexanet were assessed in patients from the ANNEXA-4 study (Andexanet Alfa, a Novel Antidote to the Anticoagulation Effects of FXa Inhibitors) with intracranial hemorrhage (ICrH). METHODS: ANNEXA-4 was a single-arm study evaluating andexanet in patients presenting with major bleeding ≤18 hours after taking an FXa inhibitor. Patients received a bolus plus 2-hour infusion of andexanet. Brain imaging in patients with ICrH was performed at baseline and at 1 and 12 hours postandexanet infusion. Coprimary efficacy outcomes were change in anti-FXa activity and hemostatic efficacy at 12 hours (excellent/good efficacy defined as ≤35% increase in hemorrhage volume/thickness). Safety outcomes included occurrence of thrombotic events and death at 30 days. RESULTS: A total of 227 patients with ICrH were included in the safety population (51.5% male; mean age 79.3 years) and 171 in the efficacy population (99 spontaneous and 72 traumatic bleeds). In efficacy evaluable patients, excellent/good hemostasis 12 hours postandexanet occurred in 77 out of 98 (78.6%) and in 58 out of 70 (82.9%) patients with spontaneous and traumatic bleeding, respectively. In the subanalysis by FXa inhibitor treatment group in the efficacy population, median of percent change in anti-FXa from baseline to nadir showed a decrease of 93.8% for apixaban-treated patients (n=99) and by 92.6% for rivaroxaban-treated patients (n=59). Within 30 days, death occurred in 34 out of 227 (15.0%) patients and thrombotic events occurred in 21 out of 227 (9.3%) patients (safety population). CONCLUSIONS: Andexanet reduced anti-FXa activity in FXa inhibitor-treated patients with ICrH, with a high rate of hemostatic efficacy. Andexanet may substantially benefit patients with ICrH, the most serious complication of anticoagulation.

18136,"The Challenge of Integrating eHealth Into Health Care: Systematic Literature Review of the Donabedian Model of Structure, Process, and Outcome",2021-05-10,"BACKGROUND: Anthrax is a major but neglected zoonotic disease of public health concern in India with Odisha contributing a major share to the disease burden. Bacillus anthracis spores can be found naturally in soil and commonly affect both animals and humans around the world. Domestic and wild animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, and deer can become infected when they inhale or ingest spores from contaminated soil, plants, or water. Anthrax can be fatal if patients are not treated promptly with antibiotics. This protocol aims to describe the implementation and evaluation of the ‘One Health’ intervention model based on the principles of Theory of Change (ToC) to eliminate human anthrax from a tribal district in Odisha, India. METHODS: This study would test the effectiveness of a complex public health intervention package developed using the ToC framework for the elimination of human anthrax in Koraput district by a comparative analysis of baseline and end-line data. We plan to enroll 2640 adults across 14 geographically divided blocks in Koraput district of Odisha for baseline and end-line surveys. After baseline, we would provide capacity building training to stakeholders from the department of health, veterinary, forest, academic and allied health institutions followed by workshops on sensitization and awareness through IEC (Information Education Communication)/BCC (Behavior Change Communication) activities in the community. We would establish a state-level laboratory facility as a robust system for timely diagnosis and management of human anthrax cases. Surveillance network will be strengthened to track the cases in early stage and risk zoning will be done for focused surveillance in endemic areas. Advocacy with district level administration will be done for maximizing the coverage of livestock vaccination in the entire district. Interdepartmental coordination would be established for the effective implementation of the intervention package. CONCLUSION: This would be a first study applying One Health concept for the elimination of human anthrax in India. The findings from this study will offer important insights for policy-making and further replication in other endemic regions of the state and country.

18522,Patient Recruitment Into a Multicenter Clinical Cohort Linking Electronic Health Records From 5 Health Systems: Cross-sectional Analysis,2021-05-27,"BACKGROUND: Care personalization is key to the well-being of people with dementia according to person-centered care. With the development of the internet of things, a large quantity of personal data can be collected securely and reliably, which has the potential to facilitate care personalization for people with dementia. Yet, there are limited assistive technologies developed for this purpose, and the user acceptance of assistive technologies is low in nursing homes. Therefore, through a data-enabled design approach, a digital platform was developed for helping the care team in a nursing home to personalize dementia care, specifically in the management of behavioral and psychological dementia symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the digital platform in a real-life context with potential users from the following two aspects: (1) to explore if the digital platform could help with generating insights on the current state of each person with dementia and (2) to gather feedback on the digital platform from the care team. METHODS: The digital platform was deployed in the nursing home for 7 weeks and the data collected were visualized and presented to the care team via the digital platform. The visualizations were analyzed by the researchers for pattern detection. Meanwhile, the care team was asked to examine the visualizations and were interviewed for the following: (1) if any insights and actions were generated from the examination, (2) the usefulness of the digital platform, and (3) the improvements they would like to see. RESULTS: The data collected on the digital platform demonstrated its potential for pattern detection. Insights were generated by the care team and categorized into “client level,” “ward level,” and “team level.” The corresponding actions taken by the care team were classified into “investigation” and “implementation.” User acceptance varied across the care team, and three aspects of improvement for the digital platform were identified. CONCLUSIONS: By evaluating the digital platform, this study gained insights on applying data-enabled design for personalizing dementia care; besides, it offers future researchers some recommendations on how to integrate assistive technologies in the nursing home context.","Wang, Gubing; Albayrak, Armagan; Kortuem, Gerd; van der Cammen, Tischa JM",JMIR Form Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8196358/,560
19891,Barriers to the Use of Web-Based Mental Health Programs for Preventing Depression: Qualitative Study,2021-07-15,"This study aims to identify and synthesize qualitative research regarding residents’ experiences of gardens while living in nursing homes and residential care facilities. To provide an optimal nursing environment inspired by nature, we need to derive knowledge from the residents’ perspective. An interpretive meta-synthesis approach, a meta-ethnography, was chosen for this study. Altogether, six articles representing three continents and comprising 124 participants were included. The six articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were analyzed and synthesized according to Noblit & Hare’s seven phases of meta-ethnography and the recent eMERGe guidelines. Four themes were identified: (1) The garden—a place to feel a connection with life, (2) the garden—a place to sense and find comfort, (3) the garden—a place to feel healthy and alive, and (4) the garden—a place to relate past and present. An overarching metaphor, “human flourishing with dignity,” offers a deeper understanding of the meaning of the garden for older people in nursing homes and residential care. This meta-ethnography provides a reflective, systematic, data-driven synthesis based on literature spanning ten years. Rather than simply relying on retelling, the narration of experiences according to the primary researcher’s descriptions and interpretations results in new knowledge. The significance of gardens for older people’s health and well-being needs to be given greater attention and space in nursing practice, education, and health policies.","Magnussen, Inger-Lise; Alteren, Johanne; Bondas, Terese",Glob Qual Nurs Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8327254/,560
21393,Anti-abortion laws—the antithesis of the fundamental rights of women,2021-04-16,"The annual spread of influenza A virus (IAV) infection is a global concern. We examined the IAV-inactivating potential of theaflavin-concentrated tea extract TY-1, which contains abundant polyphenols, including concentrated theaflavins and catechins. TY-1 exhibited concentration- and time-dependent virucidal activity against IAV. Specifically, 5.0 mg/mL TY-1 induced a 1.33 and ≥ 5.17 log(10) 50% tissue culture infective dose/mL reduction of the viral titer compared with dextrin as the diluent control within 30 min and 6 h reaction time, respectively. The high virucidal activity of TY-1 was attributed to the combined additive activities of multiple virucidal components, including theaflavins, which led to an investigation of the virucidal mechanism of action of TY-1. Western blotting revealed that TY-1 treatment reduced the band intensity of hemagglutinin and induced the appearance of additional high molecular mass bands/ladders. In addition, TY-1 treatment also reduced the band intensity of neuraminidase (NA). A hemagglutination assay revealed that TY-1 reduced hemagglutination activity, and an NA assay revealed reduced NA activity. These results indicated that TY-1 caused structural abnormalities in IAV spike proteins, possibly leading to their destruction. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the IAV genome and electron microscopic observation of viral particles revealed that upon application of TY-1, the PCR products dissipated, which indicates that TY-1 destroyed the IAV genome, and the number of viral particles reduced. Overall, TY-1 exhibited multiple modes of IAV-inactivating activity. Our findings support the possible future practical use of TY-1 as a virucidal supplemental agent that can contribute to IAV infection control.

21964,Patient participation during primary health‐care encounters among adult patients with multimorbidity: A cross‐sectional study,2021-07-10,"BACKGROUND: Rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) is the most commonly used parameter for predicting weaning outcome. Measurement of RSBI by Wright spirometer (RSBI(standard)) is the standard method in routine clinical practice. Data specific to the accuracy and reliability of the RSBI value displayed by the ventilator (RSBI(vent)) are scarce. Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the association between the average value of RSBI(vent) at different time points and RSBI(standard), and to assess the accuracy and reliability of these two RSBI measurement techniques. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included mechanically ventilated patients who were ready to wean. At the beginning of spontaneous breathing trial using the flow-by method, RSBI was measured by two different techniques at the same time, including: (1) Wright spirometer (breathing frequency/average tidal volume in 1 min) (RSBI(standard)), and (2) the values displayed on the ventilator at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 s (RSBI(vent)). RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were enrolled. The RSBI(vent) value was significantly higher than the RSBI(standard) value for every comparison. According to Spearman’s correlation coefficient (r) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the average value of RSBI from 5 time points (0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 s) showed the best correlation with the standard technique (r = 0.76 [P < 0.001], and ICC = 0.79 [95% CI 0.61–0.88], respectively). Bland–Altman plot also showed the best agreement between RSBI(standard) and the RSBI(vent) value averaged among 5 time points (mean difference − 17.1 breaths/min/L). CONCLUSIONS: We found that the ventilator significantly overestimates the RSBI value compared to the standard technique by Wright spirometer. The average RSBI(vent) value among 5 time points (0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 s) was found to best correlate with RSBI(standard).","Rittayamai, Nuttapol; Ratchaneewong, Natwipha; Tanomsina, Pirat; Kongla, Withoon",BMC Pulm Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8486963/,560

Model users and relays as energy buyers and energy sellers. First, when users choose relays as their candidates, the golden section method is used to obtain the best relay power to maximize user utility. Secondly, based on the principle of maximizing the utility of matching, a mutual preference matrix between users and relays is established. Finally, based on the mutual preference matrix, an improved UDRN stable matching algorithm is proposed through the less complex GS algorithm. This algorithm will play a great role in the psychological reconstruction of doctors after the epidemic.","Zhai, Xiujun",Wireless Netw,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8287119/,560

Aim: Evaluating the association of non-previously reported coagulation proteins with COVID-19 severity and mortality. Design: Cross-sectional study of 134 COVID-19 patients recruited at admission and classified according to the highest COVID-19 severity reached (asymptomatic/mild, moderate, or severe) and 16 healthy control individuals. Methods: Coagulation proteins levels (antithrombin, prothrombin, factor_XI, factor_XII, and factor_XIII) and CRP were measured in plasma by the ProcartaPlex Panel (Invitrogen) multiplex immunoassay upon diagnosis. Results: We found higher levels of antithrombin, prothrombin, factor XI, factor XII, and factor XIII in asymptomatic/mild and moderate COVID-19 patients compared to healthy individuals. Interestingly, decreased levels of antithrombin and factors XI, XII, and XIII were observed in those patients who eventually developed severe illness. Additionally, survival models showed us that patients with lower levels of these coagulation proteins had an increased risk of death. Conclusion: COVID-19 provokes early increments of some specific coagulation proteins in most patients. However, lower levels of these proteins at diagnosis might “paradoxically” imply a higher risk of progression to severe disease and COVID-19-related mortality.","Ceballos, Francisco C.; Ryan, Pablo; Blancas, Rafael; Martin-Vicente, María; Vidal-Alcántara, Erick Joan; Peréz-García, Felipe; Bartolomé, Sofía; Churruca-Sarasqueta, Juan; Virseda-Berdices, Ana; Martínez-González, Oscar; Brochado-Kith, Oscar; Rava, Marta; Vilches-Medkouri, Carolina; Blanca-López, Natalia; Ramirez Martinez-Acitores, Ignacio; Moreira-Escriche, Patricia; De Juan, Carmen; Resino, Salvador; Fernández-Rodríguez, Amanda; Jiménez-Sousa, María Ángeles",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514618/,560

In this study, a novel concept of near-infrared (NIR) light activation of conjugated polymer dots (Pdots) at thermosensitive hydrogel nanostructures is introduced for multimodal imaging-guided synergistic chemo-photothermal therapy. Interestingly, owing to the attractive photothermal conversion efficiency of Pdots, the Pdots@hydrogel as theranostic agents is able to undergo a controllable softening or melting state under the irradiation of NIR laser, resulting in light-triggered drug release in a controlled way and concurrently hydrogel degradation. Besides, the novel Pdots@hydrogel nanoplatform can serve as the theranostic agent for enhanced trimodal photoacoustic (PA)/computed tomography (CT)/fluorescence (FL) imaging-guided synergistic chemo-photothermal therapy of tumors. More importantly, the constructed intelligent nanocomposite Pdots@hydrogel exhibits excellent biodegradability, strong NIR absorption, bright PA/CT/FL signals, and superior tumor ablation effect.

Among the various therapies, local radiotherapy is the gold standard for pain palliation from single metastasis, even though the maximum benefit is obtained between 12 and 20 weeks from initiation. In carefully selected patients, several ablation therapies achieve this objective in 4 weeks. The purpose of this study was to assess the technical success, effectiveness and possible complications of percutaneous ablation therapies in patients with symptomatic bone metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS From November 2003 to May 2008, ten ablation treatments were performed in ten patients with acute pain from metastatic bone lesions. Patient selection and choice of the most appropriate ablation treatment was made based on lesion characteristics. Three patients were treated with radiofrequency, one with plasma-mediated radiofrequency, two with plasma-mediated radiofrequency and cementoplasty, three with radiofrequency and cementoplasty and one with microwave. RESULTS Assessments were based not only on imaging but also on the visual analogue scale (VAS) score for determining pain and on changes in morphine-equivalent doses. In both cases, 3-month follow-up showed a statistically significant reduction of pain. In no case did local complications occur either during or after treatment. Only one patient treated with radiofrequency (1/9, 11%) developed low-grade fever and general malaise during the 6 days following the procedure, compatible with a post-radiofrequency syndrome, which was treated with acetaminophen (paracetamol) only and resolved on day 7. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous ablation therapies represent a safe and valuable alternative for treating localised pain from single bone metastasis, providing rapid (4-week) relief of symptoms and a significant reduction in morphine doses. This contributes to improving the quality of life of patients with metastatic disease.","Carrafiello, G; Laganà, D; Pellegrino, C; Fontana, F; Mangini, M; Nicotera, P; Petullà, M; Bracchi, E; Genovese, E; Cuffari, S; Fugazzola, C",La Radiologia medica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-009-0395-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19444588/,560

DISCUSSION Reflection about the measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic and suspend in-person classes, the adoption of alternative forms of teaching, especially online ones, and their repercussions on nursing teaching strategies. There were difficulties regarding the quality of education, unequal access, and lack of knowledge from professors. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS The negative impact that emergency distance teaching had on the education of nurses stands out, in contrast to the world movement for the valuing of nurses. The legacy of this crisis must be taken advantage of through the better use of technological resources and their incorporation in teaching, having as a certainty that the distance teaching model does not encompass the totality of nursing education.","Silva, Carla Marins; Toriyama, Aurea Tamami Minagawa; Claro, Heloísa Garcia; Borghi, Camila Amaral; Castro, Thaís Rojas; Salvador, Pedro Ivo Camacho Alves",Revista gaucha de enfermagem,https://doi.org/10.1590/1983-1447.2021.20200248; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34037183/,560
69584,Trend of COVID-19 spreads and status of household handwashing practice and its determinants in Bangladesh - situation analysis using national representative data.,2020-09-13,"CONTEXT Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) have been developed to benefit patients by enabling surgeons to perform scarless surgery. OBJECTIVE To summarize and critically analyze the available evidence on the current status and future perspectives of LESS and NOTES in urology. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION A comprehensive electronic literature search was conducted in June 2010 using the Medline database to identify all publications relating to NOTES and LESS in urology. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS In urology, NOTES has been completed experimentally via transgastric, transvaginal, transcolonic, and transvesical routes. Initial clinical experience has shown that NOTES urologic surgery using currently available instruments is indeed possible. Nevertheless, because of the immaturity of the instrumentation, early cases have demanded high technical virtuosity. LESS can safely and effectively be performed in a variety of urologic settings. As clinical experience increases, expanding indications are expected to be documented and the efficacy of the procedure to improve. So far, the quality of evidence of all available studies remains low, mostly being small case series or case-control studies from selected centers. Thus, the only objective benefit of LESS remains the improved cosmetic outcome. Prospective, randomized studies are largely awaited to determine which LESS procedures will be established and which are unlikely to stand the test of time. Technology advances hold promise to minimize the challenging technical nature of scarless surgery. In this respect, robotics is likely to drive a major paradigm shift in the development of LESS and NOTES. CONCLUSIONS NOTES is still an investigational approach in urology. LESS has proven to be immediately applicable in the clinical field, being safe and feasible in the hands of experienced laparoscopic surgeons. Development of instrumentation and application of robotic technology are expected to define the actual role of these techniques in minimally invasive urologic surgery.","Autorino, Riccardo; Cadeddu, Jeffrey A; Desai, Mihir M; Gettman, Matthew; Gill, Inderbir S; Kavoussi, Louis R; Lima, Estevão; Montorsi, Francesco; Richstone, Lee; Stolzenburg, Jens U; Kaouk, Jihad H",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2010.08.030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20828918/,560

METHODS Retrospective record review identified 133 patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy from December 2013 to April 2015. Patients were categorized according to the type of appendectomy performed (SILA or CLA). Patient characteristics and surgical outcomes were compared between the 2 groups. Postoperative complication rates were compared using the Clavien-Dindo classification. Postoperative pain was assessed using a visual analog scale immediately postsurgery; at 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours postoperatively, and at 7 days postoperatively. RESULTS Record review identified 38 patients who had undergone SILA and 95 patients who had undergone CLA. No significant differences in clinical characteristics were found between the 2 groups. There were no significant differences in operation time, time to flatus, or length of hospital stay. Overall complication rates were not significantly different between the 2 groups. No complications worse than grade IIIa occurred in the SILA group. Postoperative pain scores were not significantly different between the 2 groups at any time point. CONCLUSION We found comparable surgical outcomes for SILA compared to CLA. Even in a small hospital with limited surgical instruments and staff experience, SILA may be a feasible and safe technique.","Kang, Byung Hee; Yoon, Kyung Chul; Jung, Sung Woo; Lee, Gyeo Ra; Lee, Hyung Soon",Annals of surgical treatment and research,https://doi.org/10.4174/astr.2016.91.2.74; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27478812/,560
73666,Effect of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among Bangladeshi healthcare professionals: A cross-sectional study.,2021,"INTRODUCTION Diagnostic tests play a critical role in the management of Sars-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. There are two groups of tests, which are in widespread use to identify patients who have contracted the virus. The commonly used reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test becomes negative once viral shedding ceases by approximately three weeks. Antibody tests directed to viral antigens become positive after the second week of infection. IgG antibody responses to the virus are muted in children, pregnant females and those with mild symptoms. IgA and IgM antibodies rapidly wane although IgG antibodies directed to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) glycoprotein are more durable. Current data shows variability in the sensitivity of commercial and in-house antibody tests to SARS-CoV-2. AREAS COVERED The role of T cells in acute illness is uncertain but long-term protection against the virus may rely on memory T cell responses. Measuring memory T cell responses is important for retrospective confirmation of cases, who may have been infected early in the pandemic before reliable RT-qPCR tests were available and whose SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may have become undetectable. Relevant peer-reviewed published references from PubMed are included up to 15 March 2021. The reader is advised to seek up-to-date information on specific aspects of COVID-19 which are changing on a daily basis.

73792,Primary care physician-led health reform.,2014,"BACKGROUND Treatment with carboplatin (CBDCA) with weekly paclitaxel (PTX) has shown survival benefits compared with vinorelbine or gemcitabine in elderly patients with non-small-cell carcinoma (NSCLC). Docetaxel (DOC), however, remains a standard treatment in NSCLC. The 130-nm albumin-bound formulation of PTX (nab-PTX) has shown activity in NSCLC. Treatment with CBDCA with weekly nab-PTX showed significantly higher efficacy than CBDCA with PTX in patients with squamous histology and significantly increased overall survival (OS) in patients aged 70 years and older. PATIENTS AND METHODS This randomized, multicenter, phase III trial (UMIN000019843) was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of CBDCA with nab-PTX with DOC in patients aged 70 years and older with advanced squamous NSCLC. Elderly patients who have received no previous chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic squamous NSCLC with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 will be randomized 1:1 to DOC (60 mg/m2 intravenous [I.V.] on day 1) or CBDCA (area under the blood concentration time curve 6 on day 1) with nab-PTX (100 mg/m2 I.V. on days 1, 8, and 15) of each 21-day cycle. The primary end point is OS. Recruitment began in December 2015 and planned enrollment is 250 patients. CONCLUSION If OS is greater in patients treated with CBDCA with nab-PTX than with DOC, this study will provide a new standard of care for elderly patients with squamous NSCLC.","Kogure, Yoshihito; Saka, Hideo; Takiguchi, Yuichi; Atagi, Shinji; Kurata, Takayasu; Ebi, Noriyuki; Inoue, Akira; Kubota, Kaoru; Takenoyama, Mitsuhiro; Seto, Takashi; Kada, Akiko; Yamanaka, Takeharu; Ando, Masahiko; Yamamoto, Nobuyuki; Gemma, Akihiko; Ichinose, Yukito",Clinical lung cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cllc.2018.05.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29861395/,560

PURPOSE Based on the pharmacokinetic profile of levothyroxine, a 3-day hold guideline for adult patients ordered for intravenous (IV) levothyroxine was implemented at a tertiary academic medical center. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the implementation of an IV levothyroxine hold guideline. METHODS This single-center, retrospective analysis identified patients ordered for IV levothyroxine during a thirteen-week period before and after implementation of the guideline. The primary outcome was guideline adherence, defined as full implementation of the three-day hold. Secondary outcomes included the number of IV levothyroxine administrations avoided in the post-guideline group, extrapolated yearly cost avoidance (EYCA) post-guideline implementation, reasons for guideline non-adherence, and number of safety reports involving IV levothyroxine. RESULTS A total of 166 and 134 patients met inclusion criteria for the pre and post-guideline groups, respectively. Guideline adherence was observed in 94 (70.1%) patients, resulting in 276 vials saved in the thirteen-week post-guideline period which translated to an EYCA of $139,877. Forty orders (29.9%) were non-adherent to the guideline with the most common reason stated as nil per os (NPO). No difference in safety outcomes was seen between the pre- and post-guideline groups as evidenced by one safety report in each group. CONCLUSION We observed a high rate of adherence to an IV levothyroxine hold guideline. This was associated with a substantial cost savings over the study period with no increase in reported safety events. To our knowledge, this is the first published report of an inpatient IV levothyroxine three-day hold guideline.","Marino, Kaylee K; Crowley, Kaitlin E; Tran, Lena K; Sylvia, Daniel; Dell'Orfano, Heather; DeGrado, Jeremy R; Szumita, Paul M",American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33821921/,560

METHODS Thirty-six hindlimbs from cats with intact (Gi group) and transected CrCLs were treated with fabellotibial suture alone (GFW group), suture combined with an absorbable polylactide bone anchor (GWD group), or suture combined with a nonabsorbable bone anchor (GFT group), positioned in a limb press with predefined joint angles (stifle joint: 120 ± 5°; hock joint: 120 ± 5°) and loaded with 10%, 20%, and 30% of body mass (BM). Predefined points were measured on lateral radiographs and with a coordinate measurement machine. Distances on radiographs (mm) were measured and angles (°) were calculated to represent the craniocaudal movement and the internal rotation of the tibia. RESULTS There were no differences for craniocaudal movement between Gi and GFW or GFT, but for GWD regarding angle measurement at 30% BM. For internal rotation, there was no significant difference between Gi and GFW or GWD, but for GFT. CONCLUSION The used absorbable polylactide bone-anchor was able to stabilize the stifle joint regarding internal rotation and craniocaudal movement as calculated from distance measurements.","Koch, Lydia; Bockstahler, Barbara; Tichy, Alexander; Peham, Christian; Schnabl-Feichter, Eva",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11061695; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34200227/,560

As a preliminary step towards filling this guidance gap, we propose a conflict-specific framework that aims to guide decision makers focused on the health and nutrition of women and children affected by conflict to prioritise interventions that would address the major causes of mortality and morbidity among women and children in their particular settings and that could also be feasibly delivered in those settings. Assessing local needs, identifying relevant interventions from among those already recommended for humanitarian settings or universally, and assessing the contextual feasibility of delivery for each candidate intervention are key steps in the framework. We illustratively apply the proposed decision making framework to show what a framework-guided selection of priority interventions might look like in three hypothetical conflict contexts that differ in terms of levels of insecurity and patterns of population displacement. In doing so, we aim to catalyse further iteration and eventual field-testing of such a decision making framework by local, national, and international organisations and agencies involved in the humanitarian health response for women and children affected by conflict.","Gaffey, Michelle F; Waldman, Ronald J; Blanchet, Karl; Amsalu, Ribka; Capobianco, Emanuele; Ho, Lara S; Khara, Tanya; Martinez Garcia, Daniel; Aboubaker, Samira; Ashorn, Per; Spiegel, Paul B; Black, Robert E; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A",Lancet,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(21)00133-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33503457/,560
83141,The Impact of COVID-19 on Patients With Schizophrenia and Their Access to Health Care.,2021-03-18,"Host factors provide critical support for every aspect of the virus life cycle. We recently identified the valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97, an abundant cellular ATPase with diverse cellular functions, as a host factor important for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) replication. In cultured cells, using siRNA-mediated protein depletion and pharmacological inhibitors, we show that VCP is crucial for replication of three flaviviruses: JEV, Dengue, and West Nile viruses. An FDA-approved VCP inhibitor, CB-5083, extended survival of mice in the animal model of JEV infection. While VCP depletion did not inhibit JEV attachment on cells, it delayed capsid degradation, potentially through the entrapment of the endocytosed virus in clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). Early during infection, VCP-depleted cells showed an increased colocalization of JEV capsid with clathrin, and also higher viral RNA levels in purified CCVs. We show that VCP interacts with the JEV nonstructural protein NS5 and is an essential component of the virus replication complex. The depletion of the major VCP cofactor UFD-1 also significantly inhibited JEV replication. Mechanistically, thus, VCP affected two crucial steps of the JEV life cycle - nucleocapsid release and RNA replication. Our study establishes VCP as a common host factor with a broad antiviral potential against flaviviruses.ImportanceJEV is the leading cause of viral encephalitis epidemics in South-east Asia, affecting majorly children with high morbidity and mortality. Identification of host factors is thus essential for the rational design of anti-virals that are urgently need as therapeutics. Here we have identified the VCP protein as one such host-factor. This protein is highly abundant in cells and engages in diverse functions and cellular pathways by its ability to interact with different co-factors. Using siRNA mediated protein knockdown, we show that this protein is essential for release of the viral RNA into the cell so that it can initiate replication. The protein plays a second crucial role for the formation of the JEV replication complex. FDA-approved drugs targeting VCP show enhanced mouse survival in JE model of disease, suggesting that this could be a druggable target for flavivirus infections.","Sehrawat, Sapna; Khasa, Renu; Deb, Arundhati; Prajapat, Surendra Kumar; Mallick, Suvadip; Basu, Anirban; Surjit, Milan; Kalia, Manjula; Vrati, Sudhanshu",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02336-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33731458/,560

Fist is to demonstrate that most values that underpin public health policy are a source of reasonable disagreement amongst citizens to whom said policy applies. This demands from the state to be explicit about whether it espouses neutrality or perfectionism to justify public health policy. Second is to argue in favor of a perfectionist mode of justification of public health policy. To do so I will argue that the lowest common denominator approach to public health policy justification to which neutralists are committed yields policy that is strong in justification but feeble in impact. Perfectionist public health policy does not face this problem. Perfectionism however, is allegedly elitist and objectionably paternalistic. I will argue that the former objection is based on an uncharitable reading of perfectionism. To mitigate the latter concern, I will offer a liberal proviso.","Ismaili M'hamdi, Hafez",The American journal of bioethics : AJOB,https://doi.org/10.1080/15265161.2021.1907479; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33871324/,560

In this study, we sought to (a) examine if health care workers intensely involved in the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are experiencing negative psychological and emotional outcomes, and (b) investigate if helping related factors (prosocial motivation and perceived prosocial impact) exacerbate and mitigate relationships to negative outcomes in a crisis situation. Using data collected from doctors and nurses before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we examine the relationship between intensity of involvement in the COVID-19 pandemic response and emotional exhaustion and depression, as well as the moderating effects of prosocial motivation and perceived prosocial impact. Data was collected at three time points (T1 and T2 prepandemic, and T3 during COVID-19), with prosocial motivation and controls collected at T1/T2 and predictors and outcomes collected during the pandemic. We find that intensity of involvement does associate with emotional exhaustion at work and that higher prosocial motivation exacerbates this relationship. Supplemental analyses suggest that the exposure to self-dimension of involvement is positively associated with emotional exhaustion and depression. Understanding the roles of prosocial motivation and prosocial impact in managing regulatory resources has important ramifications for health care workers on the frontlines of health crises responses, as these resources are necessary to manage the associated trauma.

97062,Bibliography of published COVID-19 in children literature.,2021-05-06,INTRODUCTION IFN-lambda (type III-IFN-λ1) is a molecule primarily produced by epithelial cells that provides an important first-line defense against viral respiratory infections and has been linked to the pathogenesis of viral induced wheezing in early life. The goal of this study was to better understand the regulation of innate IFN-lambda responses in vitro in primary human infant airway epithelial cells (AECs) and in vivo using nasal aspirates during viral respiratory infections. METHODS IFN-lambda protein levels were quantified: I) in human infant AECs exposed to (poly(I:C) dsRNA) under different experimental conditions (n=8 donors); and II) in nasal aspirates of young children (≤3 years) hospitalized with viral respiratory infection (n=138) and in uninfected controls (n= 74). In vivo IFN-lambda airway levels during viral infections were correlated with individual characteristics and respiratory disease parameters. RESULTS Our in vitro experiments showed that the poly(I:C)-induced innate production of IFN-lambda in human infant AECs is regulated by: I) p38-MAPK/NF-kB dependent mechanism; and II) exposure to pro-inflammatory signals such as IL1β. Our in vivo studies demonstrated that: I) infants (<18 months) had higher virus-induced IFN-lambda airway secretion; II) subjects with RSV infection showed the highest IFN-lambda airway levels; and III) individuals with the highest virus-induced IFN-lambda levels (>90th percentile) had higher viral loads and were more likely to have respiratory sick visits within 12-months of discharge (OR= 5.8). CONCLUSION IFN-lambda responses to dsRNA in the human infant airway epithelium are regulated by p38-MAPK and NF-kB signaling. High in vivo IFN-lambda production is influenced by virus type and associated with recurrent respiratory sick visits in young children.,"Salka, Kyle; Arroyo, Maria; Chorvinsky, Elizabeth; Abutaleb, Karima; Perez, Geovanny F; Wolf, Seth; Xuchen, Xilei; Weinstock, Jered; Gutierrez, Maria J; Pérez-Losada, Marcos; Pillai, Dinesh K; Nino, Gustavo",Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/cea.13701; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32623773/,560

The present study applies technetium-99m-mercapto-acetyl-tri-glycine [99mTc-MAG3] scintigraphy for the longitudinal follow-up examination of long-term kidney function after renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. METHODS Unilateral warm ischemia was induced in scid beige mice by vascular clamping of the kidney hilum for 40 min. 99mTc-MAG3 scintigraphy was performed prior to injury, 8 and 14 days post ischemia. The fractional uptake rate [FUR] was calculated from scintigraphy data as a measure of renal clearance. RESULTS FUR demonstrated a significant functional impairment of the ischemic kidney 8 and 14 days after injury (P < 0.05 vs. baseline), while contralateral non-ischemic kidneys showed no significant changes. In histological analysis, ischemic kidneys exhibited tubular dilatation and cytoplasmic degeneration as signs of hypoxia without any evidence for necrosis. CONCLUSIONS FUR enables the detection of renal dysfunction and longitudinal long-term follow-up examination in the same individual. Our model may facilitate preclinical therapy evaluation for the identification of effective renoprotective therapies.","Herrler, Tanja; Wang, Hao; Tischer, Anne; Bartenstein, Peter; Jauch, Karl-Walter; Guba, Markus; Diemling, Markus; Nimmon, Cyril; Hacker, Marcus",EJNMMI research,https://doi.org/10.1186/2191-219x-2-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22264389/,560

METHODS Constant, intermittent, and stepping-down SD strategies were modeled at 4 mean magnitudes (5%, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %), 2 time windows (40-days, 80-days), and 2 levels of personal caution (30 % and 50 %). RESULTS The stepping-down strategy was the best long-term SD strategy to minimize the peak number of active COVID-19 cases and associated deaths. The stepping-down strategy also resulted in a reduction in total time required to SD over a two-year period by 6.5 % compared to an intermittent or constant SD strategy. An 80-day SD time-window was statistically more effective in maintaining control over the COVID-19 pandemic than a 40-day window. However, the results were dependent upon 50 % of people being cautious (engaging in personal protection measures). CONCLUSION If people exercise caution while in public by protecting themselves (e.g., wearing a facemask, proper hand hygiene and avoid agglomeration) the magnitude and duration of SD necessary to maintain control over the pandemic can be reduced. Our models suggest that the most effective way to reduce SD over a two-year period is a stepping-down approach every 80 days. According to our model, this method would prevent a second peak and the number of intensive care units needed per day would be within the threshold of those currently available.","Kennedy, Deanna M; Zambrano, Gustavo José; Wang, Yiyu; Neto, Osmar Pinto",Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32454433/,560

Social inclusion of health insurance in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review.,2019,"BACKGROUND Transvaginal cholecystectomy has been performed successfully at several research institutions worldwide using natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) techniques. However, it is a growing new surgical concept in China. Several technical challenges hinder the safe clinical application of NOTES. This study investigated transvaginal endoscopic cholecystectomy performed with the assistance of a single umbilical trocar and achieved helpful initial clinical experience. METHODS From May 2009 to April 2010, a total of 43 transvaginal human cholecystectomies were performed. A single umbilical trocar was used for safe access and laparoscopic assistance during the operation. After the gallbladder had been removed through the vagina, the colpotomy was closed with absorbable stitches under direct vision. In addition, Student's t-test was performed for two samples to estimate the superiority of NOTES over a conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) operation. RESULTS The procedure was successfully completed for all the patients. No intra- or post-operative complications occurred. The patients recovered promptly after surgery, and all were satisfied with ideal cosmetic outcomes. The postoperative pain, hospital stay, and cost of hospitalization with NOTES were much less than with conventional LC operations. CONCLUSIONS Although endoscopic instruments specifically designed for NOTES are not available, the addition of an umbilical trocar is an optimal way to allow safe performance of NOTES procedures in an easily reproducible manner. The authors' initial experience demonstrates that this hybrid technique is potentially feasible and effective for reducing postoperative pain and recovery times while improving the cosmetic results of transvaginal cholecystectomy.","Niu, Jun; Song, Wei; Yan, Ming; Fan, Wei; Niu, Weibo; Liu, Enyu; Peng, Cheng; Lin, Pengfei; Li, Peng; Khan, Abdul Qadir",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1360-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20927541/,560

We searched for randomized trials that compared SGLT-2i with DPP-4i in type 2 diabetes and reported a change in hemoglobin A1c over time. We created 2 separate analyses (one based on baseline hemoglobin A1c and the other according to US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]-approved SGLT-2i dose). Thirteen trials were included. In the analysis according to baseline hemoglobin A1c , there was a significantly greater reduction in hemoglobin A1c when baseline hemoglobin A1c was ≥8.5%, favoring SGLT-2i over DPP-4i but not when baseline hemoglobin A1c was <8.5% (mean difference [95%CI], -0.36% [-0.53% to -0.18%] and 0.04% [-0.09% to 0.17%], respectively). On restricting the analysis to trials stratifying hemoglobin A1c to <8.0% or ≥8.0%, results did not change. In the analysis based on FDA-approved SGLT-2i doses, higher SGLT-2i doses caused a significantly greater hemoglobin A1c reduction at ≤26 and ≥52 weeks compared with the highest DPP-4i doses (mean difference [95%CI], -0.11% [-0.18% to -0.04%] and -0.24% [-0.34% to -0.15%], respectively). Lower SGLT-2i doses caused a significantly greater hemoglobin A1c reduction at ≥52 weeks but not at ≤26 weeks compared with the highest DPP-4i doses (mean difference [95%CI], -0.12% [-0.23% to -0.02%] and 0.01% [-0.05% to 0.07%], respectively). In people with type 2 diabetes and a baseline hemoglobin A1c ≥ 8.0%, SGLT-2i produced significantly greater reductions in hemoglobin A1c compared with DPP-4i and may be preferred. SGLT-2i dose titration to a higher FDA-approved dose is recommended in suitable patients.","Uhrig, Jarrod L; Page, Stephanie O; Mishriky, Basem M; Patil, Shivajirao P; Powell, James R; Sewell, Kerry; Mian, Muna R; Cummings, Doyle M",Journal of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcph.1599; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32396236/,560

107558,Challenging the Stigma of Mental Illness Through Creative Storytelling: A Randomized Controlled Trial of This Is My Brave.,2020-05-09,"BACKGROUND Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence is rising among patients under age 50. As such, we set out to determine the proportion of CRC-related hospital admissions and distribution of colon cancer by stage in different age groups. METHODS The NIS database for 2002-2012 was used to investigate trends of colorectal cancer resection by age, and the ACS NSQIP database for 2012-2013 was used to investigate contemporary stage at diagnosis for colon cancer in different age groups. RESULTS A total of 1,198,421 patients were admitted to a hospital with a diagnosis of CRC and captured by the NIS database. Although the number of hospitalized CRC patients decreased from 2002 to 2012, the observed decrease was predominant in patients older than 65 years (P < 0.01) and in colon cancer compared to rectal cancer patients (P < 0.01). The proportion of patients younger than 65 years increased from 32.8 % in 2002 to 41.1 % in 2012, and the proportion of patients under age 50 increased from 9 to 12 %. In the NSQIP database, the age <50 group also had a significantly higher proportion of advanced disease (stage III/IV) compared to patients age 50 and older (62.3 vs. 47.5 %, P < 0.01). In 2012, it was observed that most patients with rectal cancer were younger than 65 years (55.8 %). CONCLUSION There was a steady decrease in the number of hospitalized patients with colorectal cancer during the last decade, primarily attributable to a decrease in the older than 65 years age patients and colon cancer patients. The proportion of hospitalized patients age <50 is rising. In addition, patients younger than 50 years were more likely to have advanced disease compared to older patients.","Moghadamyeghaneh, Zhobin; Alizadeh, Reza Fazl; Phelan, Michael; Carmichael, Joseph C; Mills, Steven; Pigazzi, Alessio; Zell, Jason A; Stamos, Michael J",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4662-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26541735/,560

110931,Loneliness and mental health outcomes among South Asian older adult immigrants in the United States a cross-sectional study.,2021-04-04,"BACKGROUND During the COVID-19 pandemic, men who have sex with men (MSM) in the USA have reported similar or fewer sexual partners and reduced HIV testing and care access compared with before the pandemic. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use has also declined. We aimed to quantify the potential effect of COVID-19 on HIV incidence and HIV-related mortality among US MSM. METHODS We used a calibrated, deterministic, compartmental HIV transmission model for MSM in Baltimore (MD, USA) and available data on COVID-19-related disruptions to HIV services to predict effects of reductions in sexual partners (0%, 25%, 50%), condom use (5%), HIV testing (20%), viral suppression (10%), PrEP initiations (72%), PrEP adherence (9%), and antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiations (50%). In our main analysis, we modelled disruptions due to COVID-19 starting Jan 1, 2020, and lasting 6 months. We estimated the median change in cumulative new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths among MSM over 1 and 5 years, compared with a base case scenario without COVID-19-related disruptions. FINDINGS A 25% reduction in sexual partners for 6 months among MSM in Baltimore, without HIV service changes, could reduce new HIV infections by median 12·2% (95% credible interval 11·7 to 12·8) over 1 year and median 3·0% (2·6 to 3·4) over 5 years. In the absence of changes in sexual behaviour, the 6-month estimated reductions in condom use, HIV testing, viral suppression, PrEP initiations, PrEP adherence, and ART initiations combined are predicted to increase new HIV infections by median 10·5% (5·8 to 16·5) over 1 year, and by median 3·5% (2·1 to 5·4) over 5 years. Disruptions to ART initiations and viral suppression are estimated to substantially increase HIV-related deaths (ART initiations by median 1·7% [0·8 to 3·2], viral suppression by median 9·5% [5·2 to 15·9]) over 1 year, with smaller proportional increases over 5 years. The other individual disruptions (to HIV testing, PrEP and condom use, PrEP initiation, and partner numbers) were estimated to have little effect on HIV-related deaths (<1% change over 1 or 5 years). A 25% reduction in sexual partnerships is estimated to offset the effect of the combined service disruptions on new HIV infections (change over 1 year: median -3·9% [-7·4 to 1·0]; over 5 years: median 0·0% [-0·9 to 1·4]), but not on HIV deaths (change over 1 year: 11·0% [6·2 to 17·7]; over 5 years: 2·6% [1·5 to 4·3]). INTERPRETATION Maintaining access to ART and adherence support is of the utmost importance to maintain viral suppression and minimise excess HIV-related mortality due to COVID-19 restrictions in the USA, even if disruptions to services are accompanied by reductions in sexual partnerships.

111181,Accuracy of infrared thermometers in very low birth weight infants and impact on newborn behavioural states.,2013,"OBJECTIVE The diagnosis of acute viral respiratory tract infections(RTI) is a challenge due to overlapping clinical presentations and lack of availability of robust diagnostic methods. This in turn leads to lack of data regarding incidence and seasonality of viral RTIs which could potentially help to implement efficient strategies of antimicrobial stewardship as well as vaccine administration. Here we utilize a commercial Multiplex PCR assay for the early diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections and discuss their epidemiology. METHODS A prospective, observational study was conducted over a period of 3 years (2017-2019). Respiratory samples received from outpatients and inpatients with suspected acute RTIs from 3 multispeciality hospitals located in the twin cities of Hyderabad-Secunderabad were subjected to FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc.). Results were tabulated and statistically analysed. RESULTS Of 513 samples 261 (50.9%) were positive for one or more pathogens. The viruses detected included Influenza A - H1 2009(26.0%), Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus(21.5%), Influenza A - H3N2 (17.0%), Human Metapneumovirus (9.4%), Influenza B (6.6%), Coronavirus (4.9%), Para-influenza virus (4.5%), Respiratory syncytial virus (3.1%) and Adenovirus (2.1%). The largest number of samples was positive during the monsoon season (43.8%). TInfluenza A - H1 2009 peaked in the monsoon season with another, smaller peak in February. CONCLUSIONS There is a bimodal peak of respiratory infections relative to the seasons, and vaccine administration should take place in April-May before the advent of the monsoons in this part of the country. Multiplexed PCR may be used as first line for diagnosis of viral infections so that infection control measures can be prioritized and antibiotic administration can be avoided in those who do not require it.","Anand, Mridu; Pavani, N",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,https://doi.org/10.1111/tmi.13501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32996228/,560

A systematic review.,2020-05-08,"We examined changes in selected muscle performance parameters after 8 weeks of interval training using two opposite running inclinations. We hypothesized that the uphill training will affect endurance muscle performance outcomes, whereas the downhill training will affect power muscle performance outcomes. Fourteen physically active volunteers were randomly assigned into either the Uphill group (UG; n = 7; uphill interval running at +10% incline) or the Downhill group (DG; n = 7; downhill interval running at -10% incline) and completed 16 training sessions. Each session consisted of ten 30 s treadmill runs at 90% of maximum aerobic speed (MAS) with a work to rest ratio of 1:2. Vertical jump performance, isometric (MVC) and isokinetic torque of knee extensors and flexors, and fatigue of knee extensors were evaluated pre and post-training. Moreover, body composition (via bioimpedance) and vastus lateralis muscle architecture (via ultrasonography) were assessed pre and post-training. Relative lean tissue mass, relative fat mass, and squat jump (cm) significantly (p < .05) changed from baseline values by +4.5 ± 4.0%, -11.5 ± 9.6%, and +9.5 ± 11.7%, respectively, only in the DG. Similarly, DG improved absolute values of knee extension rate of torque development and impulse (p < .05), whereas knee flexion peak torque angle significantly decreased in both groups (p < .05). On the other hand, the UG increased the number of repetitions achieved during the fatigue protocol and total work by 21.2 ± 32.6% and 13.8 ± 21.2%, respectively (p < .05).

Nutritional requirements of three major bovine mastitis pathogens Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Streptococcus uberis (S. uberis) were investigated in vitro. We used ultra-high temperature (UHT) treated milk with different contents of fat, protein, and carbohydrates to test the influence of the availability of various milk constituents on pathogen growth characteristics. Additionally, the bacterial growth was investigated under experimentally modified nutrient availability by dilution and subsequent supplementation with individual nutrients (carbohydrates, different nitrogen sources, minerals, and different types of B vitamins) either to milk or to a conventional medium (thioglycolate broth, TB). Varying contents of fat, protein or lactose did not affect bacterial growth with the exception of growth of S. uberis being promoted in protein-enriched milk. The addition of nutrients to diluted whole milk and TB partly revealed different effects, indicating that there are media-specific growth limiting factors after dilution. Supplementation of minerals to diluted milk did not affect growth rates of all studied bacteria. Bacterial growth in diluted whole milk was decreased by the addition of high concentrations of amino acids in S. aureus, and by urea and additional B vitamins in E. coli and S. aureus. The growth rate of S. uberis was increased by the addition of B vitamins to diluted whole milk. The present results demonstrate that growth-limiting nutrients differ among pathogen types. Because reduced bacterial growth was only shown in diluted milk or TB, it is unlikely that alterations in nutrient availability occurring as a consequence of physiological changes of milk composition in the cow's udder would directly affect the susceptibility or course of bovine mastitis.","Stürmlin, Remo; Gross, Josef J; Wellnitz, Olga; Wagner, Lea A; Monney, Camille; Oevermann, Anna; Bruckmaier, Rupert M",The Journal of dairy research,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0022029921000133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594964/,560

Here, we measured multiple domains of mental and physical health and wellness and assessed gender differences among incoming physician trainees beginning residency at an academic medical center. Methods Using a cross-sectional study design, all incoming trainees (i.e. housestaff) at Johns Hopkins Hospital received a questionnaire assessing depression, burnout, sleep, exercise, and alcohol consumption, among other domains. Standardized instruments were utilized for questionnaire development. Tests of significance were two-tailed. Results 196 of 229 incoming housestaff (86%) completed the survey, and 49% were female. A history of depression was reported in 8%, and 5.4% met criteria for at least moderate depression by Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Females were more likely to report a history of depression than males (13% vs. 3%, p=0.02) but had similar PHQ-9 scores. Four percent of participants reported feeling they were in the wrong profession. Goal and mean sleep were 7 and 6.7 hours/night, respectively. Forty-seven percent reported exercising once/week or not at all. While mean reported weekly alcohol consumption was three drinks, participants reported consuming ≥5 drinks in one sitting on average 1.6 times in the prior 6 months, and 4% used alcohol to sleep. Conclusions Incoming housestaff reported generally favorable mental and physical health at the beginning of residency training. However, exercise rates were low, and ill-suited alcohol consumption was noted, though infrequent. The few areas of possible improvement were largely similar between males and females. Wellness interventions might capitalize on the relatively high morale and health at the completion of medical school by helping to promote healthy habits, including regular exercise and avoidance of excess alcohol consumption, throughout future training and practice.","Tabibian, James H; Bertram, Amanda K; Yeh, Hsin-Chieh; Cofrancesco, Joseph; Codori, Nancy; Block, Lauren; Miller, Edgar R; Ranasinghe, Padmini D; Marinopoulos, Spyridon S",Journal of community medicine,https://doi.org/10.33582/2637-4900/1003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31897450/,560

The SRXPCT method was further applied to investigate the microvasculature changes in mouse brains (n = 14) after 14-day reperfusion from transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). 3D reconstructions of brain microvasculature demonstrated that the branching radius ratio (post- to preinjury) of small vessels (radius < 7.4 μm) in the injury group was significantly smaller than that in the sham group (p < 0.05). This result revealed the active angiogenesis in the recovery brain after stroke. As a high-resolution and contrast-agent-free method, the SRXPCT method demonstrates higher potential in investigations of functional plasticity in cerebrovascular diseases.","Miao, Peng; Wu, Zhixia; Li, Miao; Ji, Yuanyuan; Xie, Bohua; Lin, Xiaojie; Yang, Guo-Yuan",Neural plasticity,https://doi.org/10.1155/2016/3258494; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27563468/,560

To avoid ova-induced pathogenicity, sensitive and specific diagnostic means at an early stage of infection are therefore crucial. In this study, we developed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers specific for human schistosome species. The PCR products were obtained in a species-specific manner (479 bp, Schistosoma mansoni; 365 bp, S. haematobium; 614 bp, S. japonicum; 303 bp, S. mekongi) and were detectable from 0.01 pg of total worm DNA (S. haematobium, S. japonicum, S. mekongi). The primer sets were also available for multiplex use. Although some difficulties were experienced in amplifying the parasite DNA from the infected animals, schistosome DNA could be detected from one day post infection. The PCR method described herein will therefore be beneficial to detect human schistosomiasis, after some improvements in this method.","Kato-Hayashi, Naoko; Kirinoki, Masashi; Iwamura, Yukio; Kanazawa, Tamotsu; Kitikoon, Viroj; Matsuda, Hajime; Chigusa, Yuichi",Experimental parasitology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2009.11.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19948171/,560

AnaConDa (Anaesthetic-Conserving-Device; ACD; Sedana Medical, Sweden), connected between ventilator and the patient, retains isoflurane during expiration and releases it back during inspiration. The reflection efficiency (RefEff) corresponds to the percentage of expired anesthetic molecules that are re-inspired. We compared RefEff of AnaConDa-S (ACD-50) and AnaConDa-100 (ACD-100) under laboratory (DRY) and simulated clinical conditions (CLIN) using a test lung. METHODS Measurements were made under DRY and CLIN, with different tidal volumes (TV: 300mL&500mL) and infusion rates (0.5-10mL·h-1). RefEff was calculated from the isoflurane concentration in the test-lung (CISO) and plotted against the anesthetic vapor volume exhaled in one breath (V-exh=CISO·TV). RESULTS DRY: RefEff of both devices was ≈90% over a wide range of V-exh, but decreased when V-exh exceeded 5-7mL (ACD-50) or 10-15mL (ACD-100). CLIN: RefEff of ACD-50 was 70-80% (ACD-100: 80-90%), decreasing gradually with increasing V-exh. For 1 Vol.% isoflurane at TV500, the infusion rate with ACD-50 was twofold higher compared to ACD-100 (4 versus 2 mL·h-1). CONCLUSION Under DRY and concentrations <1.5Vol.%, RefEff of both devices is around 90%. Under CLIN, ACD-100 performs better with RefEff between 80-90% (ACD-50:70-80%), decreasing with increased vapor volume exhaled in one breath.","Kermad, Azzeddine; Speltz, Jacques; Daume, Philipp; Volk, Thomas; Meiser, Andreas",Expert review of medical devices,https://doi.org/10.1080/17434440.2021.1865151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33322972/,560
125431,Role of Speech Pathology in a Multidisciplinary Approach to a Patient With Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.,2021-03-01,"The advantages from exogenously applied RNAi biopesticides have yet to be realized in through commercialization due to inconsistent activity of the dsRNA trigger, and the activity level of RNAi suppression. This has prompted research on improving delivery methods for applying exogenous dsRNA into plants and insects for the management of pests and pathogens. Another aspect to improve RNAi activity is the incorporation of modified 2'-F pyrimidine nucleotides into the dsRNA trigger. Modified dsRNA incorporating 32-55% of the 2'-F- nucleotides produced improved RNAi activity that increased insect mortality by 12-35% greater than non-modified dsRNA triggers of the same sequence. These results were repeatable across multiple Hemiptera: the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri, Liviidae); whitefly (Bemisia tabaci, Aleyroididae); and the glassy-winged sharpshooter (Homalodisca vitripennis, Cicadellidae). Studies using siRNA with modified 2'-F- pyrimidines in mammalian cells show they improved resistance to degradation from nucleases, plus result in greater RNAi activity, due to increase concentrations and improved binding affinity to the mRNA target. Successful RNAi biopesticides of the future will be able to increase RNAi repeatability in the field, by incorporating modifications of the dsRNA, such as 2'-F- pyrimidines, that will improve delivery after applied to fruit trees or crop plants, with increased activity after ingestion by insects. Costs of RNA modification have decreased significantly over the past few years such that biopesticides can now compete on pricing with commercial chemical products.","Hunter, Wayne Brian; Wintermantel, William M",Plants,https://doi.org/10.3390/plants10091782; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34579315/,560

In the deep sea, hexactinellid sponges are major DSi consumers that remain poorly understood. Their DSi consumption departs from the Michaelis-Menten kinetics of shallow-water demosponges and appears particularly maladapted to incorporating DSi from the modest concentrations typical of the modern ocean. Why did sponges not adapt to the shrinking DSi availability that followed diatom expansion some 100 to 65 million years ago? We propose that sponges incorporate DSi combining passive (aquaglyceroporins) and active (ArsB) transporters, while only active transporters (SITs) operate in diatoms and choanoflagellates. Evolution of greater silicon transport efficiency appears constrained by the additional role of aquaglyceroporins in transporting essential metalloids other than silicon. We discuss the possibility that lower energy costs may have driven replacement of ancestral SITs by less efficient aquaglyceroporins, and discuss the functional implications of conservation of aquaglyceroporin-mediated DSi utilization in vertebrates.","Maldonado, M; López-Acosta, M; Beazley, L; Kenchington, E; Koutsouveli, V; Riesgo, A",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba9322; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832609/,560

However, questions of cost and efficiency remain. METHODS We prospectively collected perioperative outcome and efficiency (operative time, case volume) data for our single-site robotic cholecystectomy cases and retrospectively reviewed data for our single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy cases. RESULTS There were no differences in patient characteristics or perioperative outcomes between the robotic (n = 20) and laparoscopic (n = 10) groups; operative times were equivalent (84.6 vs 85.5 min; p = 0.8737) and blood loss and complications were minimal. There was a higher robotic case volume, with an average of two robotic cases (range 1-4)/day vs one/day for laparoscopic cases (range 1-1; p = 0.0306). Streamlined instrument costs were essentially equivalent.

127697,Research on reducing burnout in health care workers in critical situations such as COVID-19 outbreak.,2020-06-16,"The frustrating interfacial issue between Li metal anode and solid electrolyte is the main obstacle that restricts the commercial promotion of solid-state batteries. Garnet-type ceramic electrolyte with high stability against metallic Li has drawn much attention, but it also suffers from huge interfacial resistance and Li dendrite penetration due to the unavoidable formation of carbonate passivation layer and limited interface contact. Herein, we propose a facile and effective method of flame vapor deposition to spray candle soot coating on garnet surface. It enables the reduction of carbonate layer and the conversion to highly lithiophilic interlayer especially when contacting with molten Li. The lithiophilicity is rooted in the enrichment of graphitic polycrystalline domains in candle soot, which can be chemically or electrochemically lithiated to form ionic/electronic dual conductive network containing LiC6 moieties. The candle soot interlayer binds Li metal with garnet electrolyte tightly with gradual transition of Li-ion conductivity, leading to a significant reduction of area specific resistance to 50 Ω•cm2 at 60℃ with high cycling and current endurance. Garnet based symmetric cells and solid-state full cells conducting this strategy exhibit impressive electrochemical reversibility and durability under the preservation of compact interface and smooth Li plating/striping. The modified Li/garnet/FeF3 batteries exhibit a discharge capacity as high as 500 mAh∙g-1 and long-term cyclability for at least 1500 cycles (with capacity preserved at 281.7 and 201 mAh∙g-1 at 100 and 200 μA•cm-2 respectively).

Over the course of the pandemic from March to July 2020 the proportion of participants at risk for clinical depression ranges from 46% to 61%, up to a 90% increase in depression rates compared to the same population just prior to the pandemic.

A cross-sectional vignette study.,2020-08-19,"Background Aphemia, or pure motor mutism, is a phenomenon that has been reported previously in the literature and typically is associated with small infarcts in the inferior dominant precentral gyrus, pars opercularis, or inferior perirolandic gyrus. Clinically, it is important to distinguish aphemia from aphasia syndromes. Telemedicine is becoming more prevalent and involving neurologists across the country. This is an important consideration when addressing aphemic patients as many mistakes can be made during a virtual exam clouding a patient's clinical picture. Case Presentation Our patient is a 61-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and an old right frontoparietal stroke without any residual deficits. She presented after her family stated that she ""quit speaking"" for about seven hours. Initial neurological evaluation was done via telemedicine due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was pertinent for decreased consciousness, inability to answer either orientation question, a right facial droop, and aphasia. Later it was found that the patient exhibited a pure motor mutism rather than aphasia and had an MRI lesion in the left inferior precentral gyrus. Conclusion Differentiating aphemia from aphasia is an important clinical skill for a neurologist to foster especially in the era of telemedicine. An intimate knowledge of the parts of a speech exam are vital in directing emergency staff during stroke evaluation. Additionally, distinguishing these clinical syndromes has implications with respect to prognosis and long-term rehabilitation.","Kasturiarachi, Brittany M; Krishnaiah, Balaji",The Neurohospitalist,https://doi.org/10.1177/1941874421990546; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34567396/,560

Nebulised amphotericin B has been used to eradicate Candida as part of selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) protocols, but its effectiveness is unknown. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of nebulised amphotericin B in eradicating Candida respiratory tract colonisation in patients receiving SDD. METHODS We included consecutive mechanically ventilated patients during a four-year period. Microbiological screening was performed upon admission and twice weekly thereafter according to a standardised protocol. A colonisation episode was defined as the presence of Candida species in two consecutive sputum samples taken at least one day apart. To correct for time-varying bias and possible confounding, we used a multistate approach and performed time-varying Cox regression with adjustment for age, disease severity, Candida load at baseline and concurrent corticosteroid use. RESULTS Among 1,819 patients, colonisation with Candida occurred 401 times in 363 patients; 333 of these events were included for analysis. Decolonisation occurred in 51 of 59 episodes (86%) and in 170 of 274 episodes (62%) in patients receiving and not receiving nebulised amphotericin B, respectively. Nebulised amphotericin B was associated with an increased rate of Candida eradication (crude HR 2.0; 95% CI 1.4 to 2.7, adjusted HR 2.2; 95% CI 1.6 to 3.0). Median times to decolonisation were six and nine days, respectively. The incidence rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia, length of stay and mortality did not differ between both groups. CONCLUSIONS Nebulised amphotericin B reduces the duration of Candida colonisation in the lower respiratory tracts of mechanically ventilated critically ill patients receiving SDD, but data remain lacking that this is associated with a meaningful improvement in clinical outcomes. Until more evidence becomes available, nebulised amphotericin B should not be used routinely as part of the SDD protocol.","Ong, David S Y; Klein Klouwenberg, Peter M C; Spitoni, Cristian; Bonten, Marc J M; Cremer, Olaf L",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/cc13056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24119707/,560

Methods One hundred patients aged >65 years were randomly allocated into either the PEEP5 or the electrical impedance tomography (EIT) group (PEEPEIT). Each group underwent volume-controlled ventilation (tidal volume 6 mL/kg predicted body weight) with the PEEP either fixed at 5 cmH2O or set at an individualized EIT setting. The primary endpoint was the ratio of the arterial oxygen partial pressure to the fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2). The secondary endpoints included the driving pressure, and dynamic respiratory system compliance (Cdyn). Other outcomes, such as the mean airway pressure (Pmean), mean arterial pressure (MAP), lung complications and the length of hospital stay were explored. Results The optimal PEEP set by EIT was significantly higher (range from 9-13 cmH2O) than the fixed PEEP. PaO2/FiO2 was 47 mmHg higher (95% CI: 7-86 mmHg; P=0.021), Cdyn was 4.3 mL/cmH2O higher (95% CI: 2.1-6.7 cmH2O; P<0.001), and the driving pressure was 3.7 cmH2O lower (95% CI: 2.2-5.1 mmH2O; P<0.001) at 0.5 h during one-lung ventilation (OLV) in the PEEPEIT group than in the PEEP5 group. At 1 h during OLV, PaO2/FiO2 was 93 mmHg higher (95% CI: 58-128 mmHg; P<0.001), Cdyn was 4.4 mL/cmH2O higher (95% CI: 1.9-6.9 mL/cmH2O; P=0.001), and the driving pressure was 4.9 cmH2O lower (95% CI: 3.8-6.1 cmH2O; P<0.001) in the PEEPEIT group than in the PEEP5 group. PaO2/FiO2 was 107 mmHg higher (95% CI: 56-158 mmHg; P<0.001) in the PEEPEIT group than in the PEEP5 group during double-lung ventilation at the end of surgery. Conclusions PEEP values determined with EIT effectively improved oxygenation and lung mechanics during one lung ventilation in elderly patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgery.","Liu, Kun; Huang, Chengya; Xu, Meiying; Wu, Jingxiang; Frerichs, Inez; Moeller, Knut; Zhao, Zhanqi",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm.2019.11.95; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32042773/,560

These results, which are in agreement with the recently reported X-ray structure of a cCNGRC peptide bound to APN showing important stabilizing interactions between the unprotected cCNGRC amino terminus and the APN active site, indicate that the carboxyl and not the amino-terminus of cCNGRC peptides should be used as a ""handle"" for the attachment of toxic payloads for therapy or isotopically labeled functions for imaging and nuclear medicine.","Graziadio, Alessandra; Zanda, Matteo; Frau, Simona; Fleming, Ian N; Musolino, Manuele; Dall'Angelo, Sergio; Baldassarre, Massimiliano; Piras, Monica",Bioconjugate chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.6b00136; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27077642/,560

This pandemic has posed several challenging clinical situations to healthcare providers. OBJECTIVE We hope to highlight the distinctive challenges that COVID-19 presents in patients with serious mental illness and what steps primary medical teams can take to co-manage these patients with the psychiatry consultants. METHODS We present a retrospective chart review of four patients who were on psychotropic polypharmacy and admitted to our hospital from the same long-term psychiatric facility with COVID-19 delirium and other associated medical complications. RESULTS We illustrate how the primary medical teams and psychiatrists collaborated in clinical diagnosis, treatment, and management. CONCLUSIONS Patients with serious mental illness and COVID-19 infection require active collaboration between primary medical teams and psychiatrists for diagnostic clarification, reduction of psychotropic polypharmacy to avoid adverse effects and drug-drug interactions, prevention of psychiatric decompensation, and active management of agitation while balancing staff and patient safety concerns.","Syed, Saba; Couse, Michael; Ojha, Rashi",International journal of psychiatry in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0091217420985979; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33517809/,560

PATIENTS AND METHODS Between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2013, 70 LS procedures were performed at our department. Based on the weight of the removed spleen, patients were divided into three groups: Group 1, <350 g (n=32); Group 2, 350-1000 g (n=15); and Group 3, >1000 g (n=7). The role of the learning curve was also analyzed with the first 20 surgeries considered as the learning period. The specimen was retrieved with morcellation through the lateral port site in 54 cases, whereas in 11 cases, the large spleen was retrieved through a Pfannenstiel incision. RESULTS The mean duration of surgery was 122 minutes. When considered by spleen weight, durations for Groups 1-3 were 117, 128, and 134 minutes, respectively. When considered by the learning curve, durations for learning and later periods were 149 and 111 minutes, respectively (P=.002). After the learning period, larger spleens were removed (208 versus 519 g; P=.02), and there were fewer conversions. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 5.1 days. In the 11 cases where the specimen was retrieved through a Pfannenstiel incision, the mean duration of surgery was 108 minutes, and the mean spleen weight was 1032 g. CONCLUSIONS Our study supports that the proposal that LS is safe and has numerous advantages, even in the case of massive splenomegaly. Our results were mainly affected by the spleen size and the learning curve.","Nyilas, Áron; Paszt, Attila; Simonka, Zsolt; Ábrahám, Szabolcs; Borda, Bernadett; Mán, Eszter; Lázár, György",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

164010,PS06 (P38): Mental health of patients with psoriasis during the COVID‐19 pandemic: a cross‐sectional study in a tertiary setting,2021,"Background: Effective cancer screening leads to a substantial increase in the detection of earlier stages of cancer, while decreasing the incidence of later stage cancer diagnoses. Timely screening programs are critical in reducing cancer-related mortality in both breast and colorectal cancer by detecting tumors at an early, curable stage. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the postponement or cancellation of many screening procedures, due to both patient fears of exposures within the healthcare system as well as the cancellation of some elective procedures. We sought to identify how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the incidence of early and late stage breast and colorectal cancer diagnoses at our institution. Methods: We examined staging for all patients presenting to UCSD at first presentation for a new diagnosis of malignancy or second opinion in 2019 and 2020. Treating clinicians determined the stage at presentation for all patients using an AJCC staging module (8 edition) in the electronic medical record (Epic). We compared stage distribution at presentation in 2019 vs 2020, both for cancers overall and for colorectal and breast cancer, because these cancers are frequently detected by screening. Results: Total numbers of new patient visits for malignancy were similar in 2019 and 2020 (1894 vs 1915 pts), and stage distribution for all cancer patients was similar (stage I 32% in 2019 vs 29% in 2020;stage IV 26% in both 2019 and 2020). For patients with breast cancer, we saw a lower number of patients presenting with stage I disease (64% in 2019 vs 51% in 2020) and a higher number presenting with stage IV (2% vs 6%). Similar findings were seen in colorectal cancer (stage I: 22% vs 16%;stage IV: 6% vs 18%). Conclusions: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increase in incidence of late stage presentation of colorectal and breast cancer, corresponding with a decrease in early stage presentation of these cancers at our institution. Cancer screening is integral to cancer prevention and control, specifically in colorectal and breast cancers which are often detected by screening, and the disruption of screening services has had a significant impact on our patients. We plan to continue following these numbers closely, and will present data from the first half of 2021 as it becomes available.","Zhou, J.; Kane, S.; Ramsey, C.; Akhondzadeh, M.

S-palmitoylated IFITM3 in particular directly engages incoming virus particles, prevents their cytoplasmic entry, and accelerates their lysosomal clearance by host cells. However, the precise molecular mechanisms of action for IFITM-mediated viral restriction are still unclear. To investigate how site-specific S-palmitoylation controls IFITM3 antiviral activity, here we employed computational, chemical, and biophysical approaches to demonstrate that site-specific lipidation of IFITM3 at highly conserved cysteine 72 modulates its conformation and interaction with lipid membranes leading to enhanced antiviral activity of IFITM3 in mammalian cells. Collectively, our results demonstrate that site-specific S-palmitoylation of IFITM3 directly alters its biophysical properties and activity in cells to prevent virus infection.","Garst, Emma; Lee, Hwayoung; Das, Tandrila; Bhattacharya, Shibani; Percher, Avital; Wiewiora, Rafal; Witte, Isaac P.; Li, Yumeng; Goger, Michael; Peng, Tao; Im, Wonpil; Hang, Howard C.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.11.293324,560

Yet billions of people globally lacking handwashing facilities with water and soap on premises, with gaps particularly found in low- and middle-income countries. Targeted efforts to expand access to basic hygiene services require data at geospatially explicit scales. Drawing on country-specific cross-sectional Demographic and Health Surveys with georeferenced hygiene data, we developed an ensemble model to predict the prevalence of basic hygiene facilities in Malawi, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan and Uganda. The ensemble model was based on a multiple-level stacking structure, where five predictive modelling algorithms were used to produce sub-models, and a random forest model was used to generalise the final predictions. An inverse distance weighted interpolation was incorporated in the random forest model to account for spatial autocorrelation. Local coverage and a local dissimilarity index were calculated to examine the geographic disparities in access. Our methodology produced robust outputs, as evidenced by performance evaluations (all R2 were above 0.8 with the exception of Malawi where R2 = 0.6). Among the five study countries, Pakistan had the highest overall coverage, whilst Malawi had the poorest coverage. Apparent disparities in basic hygiene services were found across geographic locations and between urban and rural settings. Nigeria had the highest level of inequalities in basic hygiene services, whilst Malawi showed the least segregation between populations with and without basic hygiene services. Both educational attainment and wealth were important predictors of the geospatial distribution of basic hygiene services. By producing geospatially explicit estimates of the prevalence of handwashing facilities with water and soap, this study provides a means of identifying geographical disparities in basic hygiene services. The method and outputs can be useful tools to identify areas of low coverage and to support efficient and precise targeting of efforts to scale up access to handwashing facilities and shift social and cultural norms on handwashing.","Yu, W.; Bain, R.

Advanced age, male gender and comorbidities have been described as risk factors for severe disease and mortality in general population [2]. COVID-19 mortality in Mexican patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) is unknown. Objectives: To describe characteristics of Mexican patients with RMDs and COVID-19, and to analyse factors associated with mortality. Methods: The Global Rheumatology Alliance COVID-19 (GRA) physician reported registry, is an international effort to collect information on COVID19 in adult patients with RMDs. GRA is an observational registry. The first patient from Mexico was registered on April 17, 2020. All Mexican patients registered in GRA until October 30, 2020 were included in this analysis. The association of mortality with demographic and clinical variables was estimated using logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 323 patients were registered, with a median age of 52 (IQR 41-61) years old, 166 (51.4%) patients lived in Mexico City. The most frequent RMDs were rheumatoid arthritis, 149 (46.1%) and systemic lupus erythematosus, 24 (19.8%). Over a third of patients with RMDs and COVID-19 (119 (36.8%)) were hospitalized, and 43 (13.3%) died. Table 1 shows clinical and demographic characteristics. In the univariable analysis, the absence of comorbidities was a protective factor, OR 0.3 (95% CI 0.1-0.6). Factors associated with mortality at COVID-19 diagnosis were age over 65 years old, having type 2 diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency, treatment at COVID-19 diagnosis with corticosteroids or with CD20 inhibitors. In the multivariable adjusted analysis, these factors remained independently associated with mortality. No associations with other treatments or comorbidities at COVID-19 diagnosis were found. Conclusion: Mexican patients with RMDs and COVID-19 in the GRA physician reported registry had a mortality of 13.3%. Factors associated with mortality were those described in the general population, such as older age and being on corticosteroids and CD20 inhibitors treatment at COVID-19 diagnosis.","Alpizar-Rodriguez, D.; Irazoque-Palazuelos, F.; Rodriguez-Reyne, T.

African countries have used different national reporting systems to publicly share data. Analyzing the content, format, and frequency of these systems could elucidate lessons for future pandemics. Methods: We examined national COVID-19 reporting practices across 54 African countries through 2020. Reporting systems were compared by type of report, frequency, and data content. We also compared reporting of metrics such as a patient demographics and co-morbidities, healthcare capacity, and diagnostic testing. We further evaluated regional and country-specific reporting practices in Cameroon, Egypt, Kenya, Senegal, and South Africa as examples from different sub-regions. Results: National COVID-19 reporting systems were identified in 53/54 (98.1%) countries in 2020. Reporting systems were diverse and could be categorized into social media postings, websites, press releases, situation reports, and online dashboards. Of countries with reporting systems, 36/53 (67.9%) had recurrent situation reports and/or online dashboards which provided the highest quality of data. Conclusions: African countries created diverse reporting systems to share COVID-19 data. Many countries used routinely updated situation reports or online dashboards. However, few countries reported patient demographics, co-morbidities, diagnostic testing practices, and healthcare capacity. Including these metrics as well as improving standardization and accessibility of data reporting systems could augment research and decision-making, as well as increase public awareness and transparency for national governments.","Judson, S.

Empirical contents are brought as examples, since the essence of this study lies in the dynamics and processes of the mobilities that characterize and transmute them. The findings corroborate the argument that physical and imaginative dimensions of tourism might become crucial to rethink the notion of tourism mobilities. Thus, the contribution of this paper is twofold: first, it broadens the discussion on tourism beyond the physical mobility of the bodies under the theoretical-methodological umbrella of mobilities;second, it highlights contradictory dimensions on tourism practices nowadays, and may guide future management of tourism activities according to the unfolding of the pandemic.","Carneiro, J.; Allis, T.",Revista Brasileira de Pesquisa em Turismo,https://doi.org/10.7784/rbtur.v15i1.2212,560

While HFNC is used in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) under weak recommendations, its efficacy remains to be investigated. Objectives: The primary objective was to examine HFNC efficacy in preventing EI among COVID-19 patients with AHRF. Secondary objectives were to determine predictors of HFNC success/failure, mortality rate, and length of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Patients and Methods: This is a prospective cohort study conducted at a single tertiary care centre in Saudi Arabia from April to August 2020. Adult patients admitted to the ICU with AHRF secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia and managed with HFNC were included. We excluded patients who were intubated or managed with non-invasive ventilation before HFNC. Results: Forty-four patients received HFNC for a median duration of 3 days (interquartile range, 1-5 days). The mean age was 57 ± 14 years, and 86% were men. HFNC failure and EI occurred in 29 (66%) patients. Patients in whom HNFC treatment failed had a higher risk of death (52% versus 0%;P = 0.001).

185542,The Dog Days of COVID-19.,2020-07-01,"The global COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented disruption to lives and livelihoods around the world. These disruptions have brought into sharp focus experiences of vulnerability but also, at times, evidence of resilience as people and institutions gear up to respond to the crisis. Drawing on intensive qualitative enquiry in 16 villages of Himalayan India and Nepal, this paper documents both dark and bright spots from the early days of the pandemic. We find intense experiences of fear and uncertainty, heightened food insecurity, and drastic reductions in livelihood opportunities. However, we also find a wide range of individual and collective responses as well as a patchwork of policy support mechanisms that have provided at least some measure of basic security. Local elected governments have played a critical role in coordinating responses and delivering social support, however the nature of their actions varies as a result of different institutional arrangements and state support systems in the two countries. Our findings highlight the changing nature of vulnerability in the present era, as demographic shifts, growing off-farm employment and dependence on remittances, and increasing market integration have all brought about new kinds of exposure to risk for rural populations in the context of the present disruption and beyond. Most importantly, our research shows the critical importance of strong systems of state support for protecting basic well-being in times of crises. Based on these findings, we argue that there is a need for greater knowledge of how local institutions work in tandem with a broader set of state support mechanisms to generate responses for urgent challenges; such knowledge holds the potential to develop governance systems that are better able to confront diverse shocks that households face, both now and in the future.","Gupta, Divya; Fischer, Harry; Shrestha, Suchita; Shoaib Ali, Syed; Chhatre, Ashwini; Devkota, Kamal; Fleischman, Forrest; Khatri, Dil B.; Rana, Pushpendra",World Development,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0305750X20304988; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X20304988,560

In contrast, whether particular viral infections can be protective or able to initiate asthma is still debated; recent studies reported herein have added to our understanding in several different domains, including natural history, virology and mechanisms. RECENT FINDINGS Animal studies support the possibility that severe infections with respiratory syncytial virus early in life may be able to diverge the immune response towards an allergic phenotype; however, in human studies, predisposition seems dominating. Human rhinoviruses are increasingly being shown to be equally important as respiratory syncytial virus even in infancy. Newly discovered respiratory viruses have also been associated with asthma exacerbations. The interferon pathway is currently scrutinized with respect to virus-induced inflammation; furthermore, indications that viral infections may be associated with remodeling phenotypes have been recently published. SUMMARY Notwithstanding the progress in epidemiology and pathogenesis of virus-induced asthma, more effort is needed in assessing possible strategies for treatment. Current treatments seem to be relatively ineffective, but new pathways give a hopeful message for future therapies.","Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G; Kalobatsou, Alexandra",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17218817/,560

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between burnout and depression. METHODS The study took place in the general hospital AHEPA of Thessaloniki. All members of the nursing staff (in total 368 subjects) took part. The protocol was self-reported and anonymous, in order to obtain as valid data as possible and included the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) to assess the level of burnout, the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) to assess personality traits, and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale to assess depressive symptomatology. RESULTS The analysis revealed a weak but significant relationship between burnout and depression. CONCLUSIONS Depression is a pervasive disorder that affects almost every aspect of the patient's life. On the contrary, burnout is, by definition, a syndrome restricted to the patient's professional environment. However, it seems that there may be two distinct types of burnout syndromes, of which the one comprising the majority of nurses has little or no common features with depression. The second type consists of individuals with a predisposition to develop burnout. The latter is characterized by more severe symptomatology, phenotypic similarity to depression and presumably common etiological mechanisms.","Iacovides, A; Fountoulakis, K N; Moysidou, C; Ierodiakonou, C",International journal of psychiatry in medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10782425/,560

SDM involves give and take, in which all parties interact to maximize the autonomy of patients. In this article I summarize the core steps of SDM and explore ways to use it to benefit patients to the greatest extent. I review three articles included in this issue of The Journal of Clinical Ethics that highlight additional approaches we can use to help patients and parents to see what may be in their own or their child's best interest. I describe how these approaches can be used in most other medical fields. I explore ways to share information with patients that are outside the usual scope of SDM. Finally, I discuss how we might look, together with patients, at what all parties are feeling before we begin the process of SDM.","Hower, Edmund G",The Journal of clinical ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33259335/,560

Laboratory studies of SARS patients in a number of countries identified the etiologic agent being a novel member of coronaviridae. High RNA concentrations of this virus in sputum make it as a highly infectious agent. Low concentrations of viral genome are also detectable in feces. Coronaviruses are ubiquitos. They cause disease in many animals including pigs, cattle, dogs, cats, and chickens. These viruses have been associated with upper respiratory infections and sometimes pneumonia in humans. SARS presents with fever, cough, malaise, dyspnea, and hypoxemia. Chest radiographs from affected regions are associated with progressive airway disease. Clinical laboratory features of SARS include lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. Currently, there is no FDA approved pharmacologic treatment for SARS. To date, no convincing clinical data is available for treatment of SARS with ribavirin. While there are some controversies about the use of systemic corticosteroids, Martin et al, in this issue of MSM, present their views on the use of pentoxyfylline (PTX) as a potential agent to be considered for SARS treatment.

204142,We should learn from the Asia-Pacific responses to COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To examine risk perceptions and behavioural responses of the UK adult population during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Conducted with a nationally representative sample of UK adults within 48 hours of the UK Government advising the public to stop non-essential contact with others and all unnecessary travel. PARTICIPANTS: 2108 adults living in the UK aged 18 years and over. Response rate was 84.3% (2108/2500). Data collected between 17 March and 18 March 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Descriptive statistics for all survey questions, including number of respondents and weighted percentages. Robust Poisson regression used to identify sociodemographic variation in: (1) adoption of social distancing measures, (2) ability to work from home, and (3) ability and (4) willingness to self-isolate. RESULTS: Overall, 1992 (94.2%) respondents reported at least one preventive measure: 85.8% washed their hands with soap more frequently; 56.5% avoided crowded areas and 54.5% avoided social events. Adoption of social distancing measures was higher in those aged over 70 years compared with younger adults aged 18-34 years (adjusted relative risk/aRR: 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1 to 1.5). Those with lowest household income were three times less likely to be able to work from home (aRR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.45) and less likely to be able to self-isolate (aRR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.88 to 0.96). Ability to self-isolate was also lower in black and minority ethnic groups (aRR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.0). Willingness to self-isolate was high across all respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Ability to adopt and comply with certain non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is lower in the most economically disadvantaged in society. Governments must implement appropriate social and economic policies to mitigate this. By incorporating these differences in NPIs among socioeconomic subpopulations into mathematical models of COVID-19 transmission dynamics, our modelling of epidemic outcomes and response to COVID-19 can be improved.","Atchison, Christina; Bowman, Leigh Robert; Vrinten, Charlotte; Redd, Rozlyn; Pristerà, Philippa; Eaton, Jeffrey; Ward, Helen",BMJ Open,,560

206526,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Physical and Mental Health in China and Spain: Cross-sectional Study,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has induced dramatic effects on the population of the industrialized north of Italy, whereas it has not heavily affected inhabitants of the southern regions. This might be explained in part by human exposure to high levels of fine particulate matter (PM) in the air of northern Italy, thus exacerbating the mortality. Since trees mitigate air pollution by intercepting PM onto plant surfaces and bolster the human immune system by emitting bioactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs), we hypothesize a protective role of evergreen forested areas in southern Italy. We compared the mortality rate due to COVID-19, the death number, the positivity rate and the forest coverage per capita in various Italian regions. Hectares of forest per capita and prevalence of deciduous versus evergreen forestal species were also estimated. In silico docking studies of potentially protective compounds found in Laurus nobilis L., a typical Mediterranean plant, were performed to search for potential antivirals. We found that the pandemic's severity was generally lower in southern regions, especially those with more than 0.3 hectares of forest per capita. The lowest mortality rates were found in southern Italy, mainly in regions like Molise (0.007%) and Basilicata (0.005%) where the forest per capita ratio is higher than 0.5 Ha/person. Our findings suggest that evergreen Mediterranean forests and shrubland plants could have protected the southern population by emission of immuno-modulating VOCs and provision of dietary sources of bioactive compounds. Moreover, in silico studies revealed a potential anti-COVID-19 activity in laurusides, which are unexplored glycosides from bay laurel. Overall, our results highlight the importance of nature conservation and applications to the search for natural antivirals.","Roviello, Valentina; Roviello, Giovanni N",Environ Chem Lett,,560

Priorities such as minimizing viral transmission, preserving personal protective equipment, and freeing hospital beds have driven unconventional approaches to managing gastroenterology (GI) patients. Conversion of endoscopy units to COVID units and redeployment of GI fellows and faculty has profoundly changed the profile of most GI services. Meanwhile, consult and procedural volumes have been reduced drastically. In this review, we share our collective experiences regarding how we have changed our practice of medicine in response to the COVID surge. Although we review our management of specific consults and conditions, the overarching theme focuses primarily on noninvasive measures and maximizing medical therapies. Endoscopic procedures have been reserved for those timely interventions that are most likely to be therapeutic. The role of multidisciplinary discussion, although always important, now has become critical. The support of our faculty and trainees remains essential. Local leadership can encourage well-being by frequent team check-ins and by fostering trainee development through remote learning.

As of December 6, 2020, the United States of America and India have the highest prevalence. Each country has implemented different strategies to control and reduce the spread of disease. Here, the association between prevalence number and health policies is evaluated by comparing 2 groups of countries: (1) Italy, the United States of America, Germany, Spain, and India with a higher prevalence than a linear trend line; and (2) Singapore and China with a lower or equal prevalence than linear forecasts. A rapid overview revealed that many countries have similar strategies for controlling COVID-19, including the suspension of air travel, the lockdown on the cities with the most cases detected, active case findings, monitoring of close contacts, and raising public awareness. Also, they used a gradual and phased plan to reopen activities. So, the difference between countries in the burden of COVID-19 can be attributable to the strict mode and nonstrict mode of implementation of strategies. Limitations at the national levels call for systemic rather than regional strategies.","Nejadghaderi, Seyed A; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Int J Health Serv,,560

Here, we demonstrate that, in addition to alarming and informing, mobile tracing can detect nearly all individuals that are infected by SARS-CoV-2, including the notorious asymptomatic infections. Besides voluntary reports of the infectious health status, our algorithm requires the location information of an overwhelming part of the population and then guarantees that almost all SARS-CoV-2 infections in that closed population can be detected. Our algorithm is based on a hidden Markov epidemic model and recursive Bayesian filtering. The potential that mobile tracing apps, in addition to medical testing and quarantining, can eradicate COVID-19 may persuade citizens to trade-off privacy against public health.","Prasse, Bastian; Mieghem, Piet Van",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14285v1.pdf,560

However, limited data are available on SARS-CoV-2 transmission from young children, particularly in child care settings (3). To better understand transmission from young children, contact tracing data collected from three COVID-19 outbreaks in child care facilities in Salt Lake County, Utah, during April 1-July 10, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed to explore attack rates and transmission patterns. A total of 184 persons, including 110 (60%) children had a known epidemiologic link to one of these three facilities. Among these persons, 31 confirmed COVID-19 cases occurred; 13 (42%) in children. Among pediatric patients with facility-associated confirmed COVID-19, all had mild or no symptoms. Twelve children acquired COVID-19 in child care facilities. Transmission was documented from these children to at least 12 (26%) of 46 nonfacility contacts (confirmed or probable cases). One parent was hospitalized. Transmission was observed from two of three children with confirmed, asymptomatic COVID-19. Detailed contact tracing data show that children can play a role in transmission from child care settings to household contacts. Having SARS-CoV-2 testing available, timely results, and testing of contacts of persons with COVID-19 in child care settings regardless of symptoms can help prevent transmission.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS­CoV­2) is a novel viral agent that can cause a life-threatening respiratory disorder named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID­19). Association between SARS­CoV­2 and SLE is not clear. We reported the first case of SLE manifestation following COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: A 39-year-old Iranian/Persian man with complaints of fever, scaling on the palms of the hands and feet, lower extremity edema, and ankle swelling was referred to Kashan Rheumatology Clinic in 2020. He was infected with SARS-CoV-2 2 months ago. The patient had proteinuria and was positive for SLE laboratory tests. After one week of treatment with prednisolone (30 mg daily) and hydroxychloroquine, paresthesia, proteinuria, and edema continued. The patient was treated with pulse methylprednisolone (1000 mg for three consecutive days), gabapentin, and vitamin B (300 mg daily), which reduced paresthesia. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case of SLE manifestation following COVID-19.

There have been extensive studies investigating the mental health of people in different populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, few studies have explored the impact of COVID-19 and its association with HRQoL. To fill this research gap and provide further empirical evidence, this study examined the impact of COVID-19 on Hong Kong people and evaluated its association with HRQoL. A total of 500 participants were randomly recruited to complete an online questionnaire on their concerns related to COVID-19. This entailed responding to the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF instrument. Data were collected between 24 April and 3 May 2020. Independent t-tests and multiple linear regressions were used to examine the association between the impact of COVID-19 and HRQoL. Overall, 69.6% of participants were worried about contracting COVID-19, and 41.4% frequently suspected themselves of being infected. Furthermore, 29.0% were concerned by the lack of disinfectants. All of these findings were associated with poorer HRQoL in the physical and psychological health, social relationships, and environment domains. On the other hand, 47.4% of participants were concerned that they may lose their job because of the pandemic, while 39.4% were bothered by the insufficient supply of surgical masks. These two factors were associated with poorer HRQoL in the physical and psychological health and environment domains. The adverse impact of COVID-19 on individuals is multifactorial, affecting all aspects of HRQoL. In addition to enhancing anti-epidemic efforts, it is equally important to implement public health and social welfare measures, thereby diminishing the adverse impact of COVID-19 on overall well-being.","Choi, Edmond Pui Hang; Hui, Bryant Pui Hung; Wan, Eric Yuk Fai; Kwok, Jojo Yan Yan; Tam, Tiffany Hei Lam; Wu, Chanchan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,560

Italy has one of the highest numbers of SARS-CoV-2-related deaths and one of the highest mortality rates. Worldwide, a more severe course of COVID-19 is associated with older age, comorbidities, and male sex. Hence, we searched for possible genetic components of COVID-19 severity among Italians by looking at expression levels and variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes, crucial for viral infection.Exome and SNP-array data from a large Italian cohort were used to compare the rare-variants burden and polymorphisms frequency with Europeans and East Asians. Moreover, we looked into gene expression databases to check for sex-unbalanced expression.While we found no significant evidence that ACE2 is associated with disease severity/sex bias, TMPRSS2 levels and genetic variants proved to be possible candidate disease modulators, prompting for rapid experimental validations on large patient cohorts.","Asselta, Rosanna; Paraboschi, Elvezia Maria; Mantovani, Alberto; Duga, Stefano",Aging (Albany NY),,560
223680,The Effects of the Face Mask on the Skin Underneath: A Prospective Survey During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Familiarity-based discrimination between studied items and similar foils in yes/no recognition memory tests is relatively poor. The complementary learning systems (CLS) framework explains this with the small difference in familiarity strength between targets and foils. The framework, however, also predicts that familiarity values of targets and corresponding similar foils are directly comparable - as long as they are presented side by side in a forced-choice corresponding (FCC) test. This is because in each trial, targets tend to be more familiar than their corresponding foils. In contrast, when forced-choice displays contain non-corresponding foils (FCNC) which are similar to other studied items, familiarity values are not directly comparable (as in yes/no-tasks). In a recognition memory task with pictures of objects, we found that the putative ERP correlate of familiarity, the mid-frontal old/new effect for targets vs. foils, was significantly larger in FCC compared to FCNC displays. Moreover, single-trial target-foil amplitude differences predicted the accuracy of the recognition judgment. This study supports the assumption of the CLS framework that the test format can influence the diagnostic reliability of familiarity. Moreover, it implies that the mid-frontal old/new effect does not reflect the difference in the familiarity signal between studied and non-studied items but the task-adequate assessment of this signal.","Bader, Regine; Mecklinger, Axel; Meyer, Patric",Neuropsychologia,,560

By July 20, 2020, there were 2,118,646 confirmed cases and 80,120 confirmed deaths. To assist with the development of preventive measures and targeted interventions to combat the pandemic in Brazil, we present a geographic study to detect ""active"" and ""emerging"" space-time clusters of COVID-19. We document the relationship between relative risk of COVID-19 and mortality, inequality, socioeconomic vulnerability variables. We used the prospective space-time scan statistic to detect daily COVID-19 clusters and examine the relative risk between February 25-June 7, 2020, and February 25-July 20, 2020, in 5570 Brazilian municipalities. We apply a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to assess whether mortality rate, GINI index, and social inequality are predictors for the relative risk of each cluster. We detected 7 ""active"" clusters in the first time period, being one in the north, two in the northeast, two in the southeast, one in the south, and one in the capital of Brazil. In the second period, we found 9 clusters with RR > 1 located in all Brazilian regions. The results obtained through the GLM showed that there is a significant positive correlation between the predictor variables in relation to the relative risk of COVID-19. Given the presence of spatial autocorrelation in the GLM residuals, a spatial lag model was conducted that revealed that spatial effects, and both GINI index and mortality rate were strong predictors in the increase in COVID-19 relative risk in Brazil. Our research can be utilized to improve COVID-19 response and planning in all Brazilian states. The results from this study are particularly salient to public health, as they can guide targeted intervention measures, lowering the magnitude and spread of COVID-19. They can also improve resource allocation such as tests and vaccines (when available) by informing key public health officials about the highest risk areas of COVID-19.","Martines, M R; Ferreira, R V; Toppa, R H; Assunção, L M; Desjardins, M R; Delmelle, E M",J Geogr Syst,,560

The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has implied a mentality change by force of circumstances, and cardiac surgery has not been stranger to this trend. The need to treat critically ill patients with an unknown evolution has compelled cardiovascular surgeons to decide whether or not to implant an ECMO system, despite the limited scientific evidence available in the context of COVID-19. To add some confusion, doubts were raised about its potential deleterious outcome in COVID-19 patients, due to its effect on lymphocyte counts and interleukin-6 concentrations. The care of the critically ill patient in a moment of national emergency in Spain took precedence over those possible formal doubts. The Spanish perspective on ventricular assist devices during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, focused on ECMO as a particular case of mechanical circulatory support, is presented. We address both the challenges posed by the pandemic and the organizational model established in Spain; changes in ECMO therapy and some lessons learned for the next outbreaks are also described.

At the heart of this performance lies neural architecture design which relies heavily on domain knowledge and prior experience on the researchers' behalf. More recently, this process of finding the most optimal architectures, given an initial search space of possible operations, was automated by Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of one such algorithm known as Efficient NAS (ENAS) against data agnostic poisoning attacks on the original search space with carefully designed ineffective operations. By evaluating algorithm performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we empirically demonstrate how our novel search space poisoning (SSP) approach and multiple-instance poisoning attacks exploit design flaws in the ENAS controller to result in inflated prediction error rates for child networks. Our results provide insights into the challenges to surmount in using NAS for more adversarially robust architecture search.","Wu, Robert; Saxena, Nayan; Jain, Rohan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.14406v1.pdf,560

Populations with serious mental illness (SMI) rely on psychosocial treatment, care coordination, and pharmacotherapy to achieve recovery goals and increase community engagement. This program evaluation of a group-based RS used mixed methods to better understand the multiple factors that contributed to successful telehealth conversion. Clients' service utilization over an 18-week period was collected to determine acceptance and the client characteristics associated with utilization (n = 72). Clients completed a treatment satisfaction questionnaire that was distributed ten weeks following telehealth conversion. Qualitative interviews explored staff perspectives on factors that impacted conversion, acceptance, and utilization. Initial staff skepticism gave way to acceptance, while the demands of resourcefulness, flexibility, and competency were emphasized. Clients' treatment utilization remained stable, while the number of missed/cancelled sessions were less frequent over time, especially for clients with a history of psychosis. Clients reported high overall satisfaction, but a preference for in-person treatment. Within this clinic serving middle to high socioeconomic status (SES) clients, clinicians and clients alike found the virtual group-based RS to be feasible and acceptable while in-person treatment was not an option.","Lynch, David A; Stefancic, Ana; Cabassa, Leopoldo J; Medalia, Alice",Psychiatry Res,,560

Sci., 2018,9, 956-972) to the use of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) cards to accelerate molecular dynamics simulations using polarizable many-body force fields. The new high-performance module allows for an efficient use of single- and multi-GPU architectures ranging from research laboratories to modern pre-exascale supercomputer centers. After detailing an analysis of our general scalable strategy that relies on OpenACC and CUDA, we discuss the various capabilities of the package. Among them, the multi-precision possibilities of the code are discussed. If an efficient double precision implementation is provided to preserve the possibility of fast reference computations, we show that a lower precision arithmetic is preferred providing a similar accuracy for molecular dynamics while exhibiting superior performances. As Tinker-HP is mainly dedicated to accelerate simulations using new generation point dipole polarizable force field, we focus our study on the implementation of the AMOEBA model and provide illustrative benchmarks of the code for single- and multi-cards simulations on large biosystems encompassing up to millions of atoms. The new code strongly reduces time to solution and offers the best performances ever obtained using the AMOEBA polarizable force field. Perspectives toward the strong-scaling performance of our multi-node massive parallelization strategy, unsupervised adaptive sampling and large scale applicability of the Tinker-HP code in biophysics are discussed.

However, current approaches often overlook the fact that the amount of information released every day is escalating, and a large amount of them overlap. Intending to accelerate fact-checking, we bridge this gap by grouping similar messages and summarizing them into aggregated claims. Specifically, we first clean a set of social media posts (e.g., tweets) and build a graph of all posts based on their semantics; Then, we perform two clustering methods to group the messages for further claim summarization. We evaluate the summaries both quantitatively with ROUGE scores and qualitatively with human evaluation. We also generate a graph of summaries to verify that there is no significant overlap among them. The results reduced 28,818 original messages to 700 summary claims, showing the potential to speed up the fact-checking process by organizing and selecting representative claims from massive disorganized and redundant messages.","Yang, Jing; Vega-Oliveros, Didier; Seibt, Tais; Rocha, Anderson",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.10992v1.pdf,560

254363,Project ECHO COVID-19: Vulnerable Populations and Telehealth Early in the Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The well-being of the world's 1.65 million seafarers is expected to be secured by the rights established under the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC), 2006 with active monitoring of its implementation by the flag administrations through the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and International Labour Organisation (ILO). However, the substantial gains achieved since entry into force of MLC in August 2013 appear to have been severely dented by the COVID-19 global pandemic. The aim of the study was to examine, on a pilot basis, the disruptions and challenges to the observance of seafarers' rights to shore leave, repatriation and medical assistance as an immediate consequence of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The impact of COVID-19 on seafarers' rights was examined in three dimensions - shore leave, repatriation and medical assistance. Questionnaires were administered online from June to August 2020 to 450 seafarers, top 10 ship-management companies, 35 shipping companies and maritime administrations of top 5 seafarer supplying countries. The paper discusses the results of the survey. RESULTS: The research revealed a previously unknown majority preference for shore leave, that diminished sharply during COVID-19. Impact on work-performance and well-being of seafarers was revealed with only a fifth of the seafarers having willingly agreed to an extension of contract. This study revealed incidence rates at 6 months into the pandemic of several parameters - delayed repatriations (21.44%) that includes crew with contract extensions (12.48%), crew with completed contract awaiting repatriation (8.96%) and crew that had exceeded 12-month continuous service (0.82%). Compensation, if provided, is meagre and was affecting ratings the most. Deprivation of medical assistance was also revealed. CONCLUSIONS: The well being of seafarers would likely remain vulnerable to breaches, unless measures are put in place to safeguard the rights assured under MLC in the face of uncertainties caused by a pandemic such as COVID-19.","Hebbar, Anish Arvind; Mukesh, Nitin",Int Marit Health,,560
256691,Three children who recovered from novel coronavirus 2019 pneumonia,2020,"Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic restrictions on the change in muscle mass in older patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), who were not infected with COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, data were obtained from outpatients who underwent bioelectrical impedance analysis at least twice before April 2020 and at least once thereafter. Skeletal muscle mass index (SMI, kg/m2) was calculated as appendicular muscle mass (kg) divided by height squared (m2). Change in SMI (kg/m2/year) was calculated as (follow-up SMI-baseline SMI/follow-up period). The differences between the changes in SMI before and after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated using paired t test. Results: This study recruited 56 patients, with a mean (SD) age of 75.2 (7.1) years. SMI changed from 6.7 (0.9) to 6.8 (0.9) kg/m2 before the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas SMI changed from 6.8 (0.9) to 6.6 (0.9) kg/m2 after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. SMI decreased after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with before the pandemic (-0.117 (0.240) vs. 0.005 (0.289) kg/m2/year, p = 0.049).

This analysis estimates the rate and risk factors associated with COVID-19-related readmission and inpatient mortality. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study utilizing deidentified chargemaster data from 297 hospitals across 40 US states on patients hospitalized with COVID-19 February 15-June 09, 2020. Demographics, comorbidities, acute conditions, and clinical characteristics of first hospitalization are summarized. Mulitvariable logistic regression was used to measure risk factor associations with 30-day readmission and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Among 29,659 patients, 1,070 (3.6%) were readmitted. Readmitted patients were more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD) vs those not readmitted (p<0.0001) and to present on first admission with acute kidney injury (15.6% vs. 9.2%), congestive heart failure (6.4% vs. 2.4%), and cardiomyopathy (2.1% vs. 0.8%) (p<0.0001). Higher odds of readmission were observed in patients age >60 vs. 1840 (odds ratio [OR]=1.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.48, 2.50), and admitted in the Northeast vs. West (OR=1.43, 95% CI=1.14, 1.79) or South (OR=1.28, 95% CI=1.11, 1.49). Comorbidities including diabetes (OR=1.34, 95% CI=1.12, 1.60), CVD (OR=1.46, 95% CI=1.23, 1.72), CKD stage 1-5 (OR=1.51, 95% CI=1.25,1.81) and stage 5 (OR=2.27, 95% CI=1.81, 2.86) were associated with higher odds of readmission. 12.3% of readmitted patients died during second hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Among this large US population of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, readmission was associated with certain comorbidities and acute conditions during first hospitalization. These findings may inform strategies to mitigate risks of readmission due to COVID-19 complications.","Verna, Elizabeth C; Landis, Charles; Brown, Robert S; Mospan, Andrea R; Crawford, Julie M; Hildebrand, Janet S; Morris, Heather L; Munoz, Breda; Fried, Michael W; Reddy, K Rajender",Clin. infect. dis,,560
257212,The Bulle: Support and Prevention of Psychological Decompensation of Health Care Workers During the Trauma of the COVID-19 Epidemic,2020,"Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is considered the ""gold standard"" for the direct diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, routine diagnosis by RT-qPCR is a limitation for many laboratories, mainly due to the infrastructure and/or disproportionate relationship between demand and supply of inputs. In this context, and to increase the diagnostic coverage of SARS-CoV-2 infections, we describe an alternative, sensitive and specific one-step end-point RT-PCR for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene. The performance of the RT-PCR was evaluated in 43 clinical samples, of which 10 and 33 were previously identified as negative and positive, respectively, by RT-qPCR. Among the positive samples, 15 and 18 were from asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, respectively. Here, 32/33 of the positive samples in the RT-qPCR, including from asymptomatic individuals, were found positive in the RT-PCR (Ct 15.94-34.92). The analytical sensitivity of the assay was about 7.15-9 copies of vRNA/µL, and nonspecific amplifications were not observed in SARS-CoV-2 negative samples. Importantly, the RT-PCR reactions were performed in a 10 µL final volume. Finally, considering specificity, analytical sensitivity and cost reduction, we believe that the RT-PCR platform described here may be a viable option for the diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 infections in laboratories in which RT-qPCR is not available.","Silva Júnior, José Valter Joaquim; Merchioratto, Ingryd; de Oliveira, Pablo Sebastian Britto; Rocha Lopes, Thaísa Regina; Brites, Patrícia Chaves; de Oliveira, Elehu Moura; Weiblen, Rudi; Flores, Eduardo Furtado",J Virol Methods,,560

Thus, this study aimed to critically review non-pharmacological respiratory strategies for this population. Original studies were searched in six databases considering predefined inclusion criteria. Other studies and recommendations were also included after a manual search. Oxygen therapy, invasive (IMV) and non-invasive (NIV) ventilation were the most frequent addressed interventions. In general, the original studies cited these strategies, but detailed information on parameters used was not provided. The recommendations provided more detailed data, mainly based on experiences with other acute respiratory syndromes in childhood. In the context of oxygen therapy, the nasal catheter was the most recommended strategy for hypoxemia, followed by the high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC). However, the risks of contamination due to the dispersion of aerosols in the case of the HFNC were pointed out. Lung protective IMV with the use of bacteriological or viral filters was recommended in most documents, and there was great variation about PEEP titration. Alveolar recruitment maneuvers were mentioned in a few recommendations. NIV was not consensual between studies, and when selected, several precautions must be taken to avoid contamination. Airway suctioning with closed-circuit was recommended to reduce aerosol spread. Information on prone positioning and physiotherapy was even more scarce. In conclusion, oxygen therapy seems to be essential in the treatment of hypoxemia. If necessary, IMV should not be delayed, and protective strategies are encouraged for adequate pulmonary ventilation. Information about techniques that are adjuvant to ventilatory support is superficial and require further investigation.","Rodovanski, Giovana Pascoali; Aguiar, Susana da Costa; Marchi, Bruna Samantha; Oliveira, Patricia do Nascimento; Arcêncio, Livia; Vieira, Danielle Soares Rocha; Moran, Cristiane Aparecida",Current pediatric reviews (Online),,560

Introduction: With support from emergency department (ED) leadership, our institution rapidly deployed telemedicine in a novel approach to large-scale ED infectious disease management at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center (NYP/WCMC) and NewYork-Presbyterian/Lower Manhattan Hospital (NYP/LMH). Materials and Methods: Nineteen telemedicine carts were placed in COVID-19 isolation rooms to conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) and mitigate infectious risk for patients and providers by decreasing in-person exposures. Results: The teleisolation carts were used for 261 COVID-19 patient interactions from March to May 2020, with 79% of overall use in March. Our urban academic site (NYP/WCMC) had 173 of these cases, and the urban community hospital (NYP/LMH) had 88. This initiative increased provider/patient communication and attention to staff safety, improved palliative care and patient support services, lowered PPE consumption, and streamlined clinical workflows. The carts also increased patient comfort and reduced the psychological toll of isolation. Discussion: Deploying customized placement strategies in these two EDs maximized cart availability for isolation patients and demonstrates the utility of telemedicine in various ED settings. Conclusions: The successful introduction of this program in both academic and urban community hospitals suggests that widespread adoption of similar initiatives could improve safe ED evaluation of potentially infectious patients. In the longer term, our experience underscores the critical role of telemedicine in disaster preparedness planning, as building these capabilities in advance allows for the agile scaling needed to manage unforeseen catastrophic scenarios.","Bains, Jaskaran; Greenwald, Peter W; Mulcare, Mary R; Leyden, David; Kim, Joshua; Shemesh, Amos J; Bodnar, David; Farmer, Brenna; Steel, Peter; Tanouye, Robert; Kim, Ji Won; Lame, Maria; Sharma, Rahul",Telemed. j. e. health,,560
260439,Survival Analysis of Patients With COVID-19 in India by Demographic Factors: Quantitative Study,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Antibody response plays a fundamental role in the natural history of infectious disease. A better understanding of the immune response in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection could be important for identifying patients at greater risk of developing a more severe form of disease and with a worse prognosis. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis to determine the presence and the levels of both anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA in a cohort of hospitalized patients with confirmed infection at different times in the natural history of the disease. Patients enrolled when admitted at the emergency department were prospectively followed up during hospital stay. RESULTS: Overall, 131 patients were considered with a total of 237 samples processed. Cross-sectional analysis showed that seroconversion for IgA seems to occur between days 6 and 15, while IgG response seems to occur slightly later, peaking at day 20 after symptoms onset. Both IgA and IgG were maintained beyond 2 months. Severe patients showed a higher IgA response compared with mild patients when analyzing optical density (8.3 versus 5.6, p < 0.001). Prospective analysis conducted on 55 patients confirmed that IgA appear slightly earlier than IgG. After stratifying for the severity of disease, both the IgA and IgG responses were more vigorous in severe cases. Moreover, while IgG tended to stabilize, there was a relevant decline after the first month of IgA levels in mild cases. CONCLUSION: IgA and IgG antibody response is closely related, although seroconversion for IgA occurs earlier. Both IgA and IgG are maintained beyond 2 months. Severe patients showed a more vigorous IgA and IgG response. IgA levels seem to decline after 1 month since the onset of symptoms in mild cases. Our results should be interpreted with cautions due to several limitations in our study, mainly the small number of cases, lack of data on viral load and clinical setting.","Carnicelli, Annamaria; Fiori, Barbara; Ricci, Rosalba; Piano, Alfonso; Bonadia, Nicola; Taddei, Eleonora; Fantoni, Massimo; Murri, Rita; Cingolani, Antonella; Barillaro, Christian; Cutuli, Salvatore Lucio; Marchesini, Debora; Della Polla, Davide Antonio; Forte, Evelina; Fuorlo, Mariella; Di Maurizio, Luca; Amorini, Paola; Cattani, Paola; Franceschi, Francesco; Sanguinetti, Maurizio",Intern. emerg. med,,560

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological profiling of critically ill COVID-19 patients was performed to determine their humoral response. Blood was collected from critically ill ICU patients, either COVID-19 positive (+) or COVID-19 negative (−), to measure anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins: IgM;IgA;IgG;and Total Ig (combined IgM/IgA/IgG). Cohorts were similar, with the exception that COVID-19+ patients had a greater body mass indexes, developed bilateral pneumonias more frequently and suffered increased hypoxia when compared to COVID-19- patients (p &lt;0.05). The mortality rate for COVID-19+ patients was 50%. COVID-19 status could be determined by anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological responses with excellent classification accuracies on ICU day 1 (89%);ICU day 3 (96%);and ICU days 7 and 10 (100%). The importance of each Ig isotype for determining COVID-19 status on combined ICU days 1 and 3 was: Total Ig, 43%;IgM, 27%;IgA, 24% and IgG, 6%. Peak serological responses for each Ig isotype occurred on different ICU days (IgM day 13 &gt;IgA day 17 &gt;IgG persistently increased), with the Total Ig peaking at approximately ICU day 18. Those COVID-19+ patients who died had earlier or similar peaks in IgA and Total Ig in their ICU stay when compared to patients who survived (p &lt;0.005). Critically ill COVID-19 patients exhibit anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological responses, including those COVID-19 patients who ultimately died, suggesting that blunted serological responses did not contribute to mortality.

274830,The Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic and the Response in Low-to-Middle Income Countries,2021,"The mRNA-1273 vaccine, popularly called the ""Moderna vaccine"" is being widely administered in the United States for the prevention of COVID-19 infection since December 2020. Mild to moderate intensity side effects like low-grade fever, myalgia, chills and malaise were reported in the trials related to the vaccine. With this case report, we report a case of purpuric rash and thrombocytopenia after receiving the first dose of the m-RNA-1273 vaccine. The patient, in this case, is a 60-year-old male patient who received the first vaccine dose and within two days, he developed diffuse papular rash associated with some thrombocytopenia. He had a history of tobacco use, Hepatitis C liver cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease stage 4, untreated hypertension and systolic congestive heart failure at the baseline. With review of the limited literature related to the vaccine and its side effect profile and with no other etiology explaining the sudden onset of rash, we attribute this thrombocytopenia and purpuric rash as the side effects of the mRNA-1273 vaccine.","Malayala, Srikrishna V; Mohan, Gisha; Vasireddy, Deepa; Atluri, Paavani",Cureus,,560

This study aimed to explore bisexual people’s experiences of sexuality, NSSI and the COVID19 pandemic. Fifteen bisexual people (16–25 years old) with experience of NSSI participated in online qualitative interviews. Thematic analysis was used. Preliminary findings were shared with a subset of participants for member-checking. Participants described experiences of falling between the binary worlds of heterosexuality and homosexuality and described discrimination and invalidation related to this. Lack of access to positive bisexual representation contributed to feelings of self-loathing, with NSSI used to manage emotions or self-punish. The effect of lockdown was not clear cut, depending on personal circumstances and meanings of social interaction for participants. There is a need for greater recognition of significant societal narratives around bisexuality within clinical formulations of mental health difficulties and NSSI within this population.

277517,Unmuting Medical Students' Education: Utilizing Telemedicine During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond,2020,"BACKGROUND: Throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers across the globe have attempted to understand how the health and socioeconomic crisis brought about by the coronavirus is affecting children's exposure to violence. Since containment measures have disrupted many data collection and research efforts, studies have had to rely on existing data or design new approaches to gathering relevant information. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the literature that has been produced on children's exposure to violence during the pandemic to understand emerging patterns and critically appraise methodologies to help inform the design of future studies. The article concludes with recommendations for future research. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The study entailed a search of working papers, technical reports, and journal articles. METHODS: The search used a combination of search terms to identify relevant articles and reports published between March 1 and December 31, 2020. The sources were assessed according to scope and study design. RESULTS: The review identified 48 recent working papers, technical reports, and journal articles on the impact of COVID-19 on violence against children. In terms of scope and methods, the review led to three main findings: 1) Studies have focused on physical or psychological violence at home and less attention has been paid to other forms of violence against children, 2) most studies have relied on administrative records, while other data sources, such as surveys or big data, were less commonly employed, and 3) different definitions and study designs were used to gather data directly, resulting in findings that are hardly generalizable. With respect to children's experience of violence, the review led to four main findings: 1) Studies found a decrease in police reports and referrals to child protective services, 2) mixed results were found with respect to the number of calls to police or domestic violence helplines, 3) articles showed an increase in child abuse-related injuries treated in hospitals, and 4) surveys reported an increase in family violence. CONCLUSIONS: This review underscores the persistent challenges affecting the availability and quality of data on violence against children, including the absence of standards for measuring this sensitive issue as well as the limited availability of baseline data. Future research on COVID-19 and violence against children should address some of the gaps identified in this review.","Cappa, Claudia; Jijon, Isabel",Child Abuse Negl,,560

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions to social work practice training and education in the classroom and field. This teaching note describes an online simulation-based learning activity known as Virtual Practice Fridays that was adapted from an in-person activity in response to the pandemic. Virtual Practice Fridays was a 10-week seminar for two cohorts of master of social work students, each facilitated by two PhD students who were supervised by a faculty member. Master of social work students developed holistic competence, including knowledge, skills, and self-awareness, as they met with two simulated clients over several sessions. Students described unique features of this simulation-based learning activity that supported their learning, such as working with clients virtually, having an opportunity to see simulated clients for several sessions from assessment to termination, and being able to use the time completed at Virtual Practice Fridays toward fulfillment of practicum hours. This was a new experience for the doctoral students and faculty member, and it permitted us to reflect on how to effectively teach students about social work practice. Implications for social work practice and education are discussed.

280046,A Broader View of Risk to Health Care Workers: Perspectives on Supporting Vulnerable Health Care Professional Households During COVID-19,2021,"Air travel during the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging for travellers, airlines, airports, health authorities, and governments. We reviewed multiple aspects of COVID peri-pandemic air travel, including data on traveller numbers, peri-flight prevention, and testing recommendations and in-flight SARS-CoV-2 transmission, photo-epidemiology of mask use, the pausing of air travel to mass gathering events, and quarantine measures and their effectiveness. Flights are reduced by 43% compared to 2019. Hygiene measures, mask use, and distancing are effective, while temperature screening has been shown to be unreliable. Although the risk of in-flight transmission is considered to be very low, estimated at one case per 27 million travellers, confirmed in-flight cases have been published. Some models exist and predict minimal risk but fail to consider human behavior and airline procedures variations. Despite aircraft high-efficiency filtering, there is some evidence that passengers within two rows of an index case are at higher risk. Air travel to mass gatherings should be avoided. Antigen testing is useful but impaired by time lag to results. Widespread application of solutions such as saliva-based, rapid testing or even detection with the help of ""sniffer dogs"" might be the way forward. The ""traffic light system"" for traveling, recently introduced by the Council of the European Union is a first step towards normalization of air travel. Quarantine of travellers may delay introduction or re-introduction of the virus, or may delay the peak of transmission, but the effect is small and there is limited evidence. New protocols detailing on-arrival, rapid testing and tracing are indicated to ensure that restricted movement is pragmatically implemented. Guidelines from airlines are non-transparent. Most airlines disinfect their flights and enforce wearing masks and social distancing to a certain degree. A layered approach of non-pharmaceutical interventions, screening and testing procedures, implementation and adherence to distancing, hygiene measures and mask use at airports, in-flight and throughout the entire journey together with pragmatic post-flight testing and tracing are all effective measures that can be implemented. Ongoing research and systematic review are indicated to provide evidence on the utility of preventive measures and to help answer the question ""is it safe to fly?"".","Bielecki, Michel; Patel, Dipti; Hinkelbein, Jochen; Komorowski, Matthieu; Kester, John; Ebrahim, Shahul; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J; Memish, Ziad A; Schlagenhauf, Patricia",Travel Med Infect Dis,,560

Herein we report on structure-activity relationships (SAR) of the noncovalent active-site directed inhibitor (R)-5-amino-2-methyl-N-(1-(naphthalen-1-yl)ethyl) benzamide (2 b), which is known to bind into the S3 and S4 pockets of the SARS-CoV PLpro . Moreover, we report the discovery of isoindolines as a new class of potent PLpro inhibitors. The studies also provide a deeper understanding of the binding modes of this inhibitor class. Importantly, the inhibitors were also confirmed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture suggesting that, due to the high structural similarities of the target proteases, inhibitors identified against SARS-CoV PLpro are valuable starting points for the development of new pan-coronaviral inhibitors.","Welker, Armin; Kersten, Christian; Müller, Christin; Madhugiri, Ramakanth; Zimmer, Collin; Müller, Patrick; Zimmermann, Robert; Hammerschmidt, Stefan; Maus, Hannah; Ziebuhr, John; Sotriffer, Christoph; Schirmeister, Tanja",ChemMedChem (Internet),,560

METHODS: Secondary analysis of 5974 HAPO study women with singleton pregnancies who underwent 75 g OGTTs and HbA1c assays between 24 and 32 weeks' gestation and who received no treatment for GDM. RESULTS: All post COVID-19 modified pathways reduced GDM frequency - UK (81%), Canada (82%) and Australia (25%). Canadian women whose GDM would remain undetected post COVID-19 (missed GDMs) displayed similar rates of pregnancy complications to those with post COVID-19 GDM. Using UK modifications, the missed GDM group were at slightly lower risk whilst the women missed using the Australian modifications were at substantially lower risk. CONCLUSIONS: The modifications in GDM diagnosis proposed for the UK, Canada and Australia result in differing reductions of GDM frequency. Each has both potential benefits in terms of reduction in potential exposure to COVID-19 and costs in terms of missed opportunities to influence pregnancy and postpartum outcomes. These factors should be considered when deciding which protocol is most appropriate for a particular context.","McIntyre, H David; Gibbons, Kristen S; Ma, Ronald C W; Tam, Wing Hung; Sacks, David A; Lowe, Julia; Madsen, Lene R; Catalano, Patrick M",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,560

To study successfully, students not only needed to be prepared in terms of digital readiness (workspace, IT equipment, previous online learning experiences, and sharing information online), they also faced challenges that pertained to the self-regulated management of external resources (environment structuring, time management, and help-seeking). In the current study, we investigated students' digital readiness for the sudden switch to online learning;differences between students' intended and actual use of external resource management strategies;and the influence of students' digital readiness on their actual use of resource management strategies. Students enrolled in a full-scale, German university (N = 662) answered two online questionnaires (before and in the middle of the term). Descriptive statistics indicated that students seemed to be ready to study online. However, repeated measures ANOVA showed that students were not able to manage their resources during the term as frequently as intended. Finally, separate regression analyses revealed that availability of workspace and IT equipment predicted the use of environment structuring strategies. Additionally, IT equipment and information sharing behavior predicted students' help-seeking. Based on the current results, we discuss implications for the promotion of student self-regulated learning (SRL) in online emergency remote teaching based on both external resources and digital readiness.","Naujoks, N.; Bedenlier, S.; Glaser-Zikuda, M.; Kammerl, R.; Kopp, B.; Ziegler, A.; Handel, M.",Frontiers in Psychology,,560

Case report: We report the case of an 18-year-old male patient presenting with a 72-hour history of abdominal pain, fever, erythematous skin rash, vomiting and diarrhoea. Examination showed he also had shock and he was first thought to have oedematous cholecystitis. SARS-CoV-2 infection was also diagnosed. He was admitted to the ICU, and echocardiography showed cardiac dysfunction, with a low ejection fraction and low cardiac index. High-sensitivity troponin serum levels were elevated. The patient received inotropic and vasopressor support. As he fulfilled several criteria for MIS-C/PIMS-TS, he was administered acetylsalicylic acid, corticosteroids and immunoglobulin, with a good clinical response. Conclusion: This case emphasizes how this severe presentation of COVID-19 can easily be misdiagnosed if the clinician is less aware of this syndrome in younger patients. LEARNING POINTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection is a diagnostic challenge in some patients with atypical clinical presentations, who may have MIS-C/PIMS-TS.Physicians should be aware of this condition when evaluating teenagers and young adults with COVID-19.","Burgi Vieira, César; Ferreira, Ana Teresa; Botelho Cardoso, Filipa; Pelicano Paulos, Jorge; Germano, Nuno",Eur J Case Rep Intern Med,,560

DESIGN: Test negative case-control study. SETTING: Community testing for covid-19 in England. PARTICIPANTS: 156 930 adults aged 70 years and older who reported symptoms of covid-19 between 8 December 2020 and 19 February 2021 and were successfully linked to vaccination data in the National Immunisation Management System. INTERVENTIONS: Vaccination with BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1-S. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were polymerase chain reaction confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, admissions to hospital for covid-19, and deaths with covid-19. RESULTS: Participants aged 80 years and older vaccinated with BNT162b2 before 4 January 2021 had a higher odds of testing positive for covid-19 in the first nine days after vaccination (odds ratio up to 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.23 to 1.77), indicating that those initially targeted had a higher underlying risk of infection. Vaccine effectiveness was therefore compared with the baseline post-vaccination period. Vaccine effects were noted 10 to 13 days after vaccination, reaching a vaccine effectiveness of 70% (95% confidence interval 59% to 78%), then plateauing. From 14 days after the second dose a vaccination effectiveness of 89% (85% to 93%) was found compared with the increased baseline risk. Participants aged 70 years and older vaccinated from 4 January (when ChAdOx1-S delivery commenced) had a similar underlying risk of covid-19 to unvaccinated individuals. With BNT162b2, vaccine effectiveness reached 61% (51% to 69%) from 28 to 34 days after vaccination, then plateaued. With ChAdOx1-S, effects were seen from 14 to 20 days after vaccination, reaching an effectiveness of 60% (41% to 73%) from 28 to 34 days, increasing to 73% (27% to 90%) from day 35 onwards. On top of the protection against symptomatic disease, a further 43% (33% to 52%) reduced risk of emergency hospital admission and 51% (37% to 62%) reduced risk of death was observed in those who had received one dose of BNT162b2. Participants who had received one dose of ChAdOx1-S had a further 37% (3% to 59%) reduced risk of emergency hospital admission. Follow-up was insufficient to assess the effect of ChAdOx1-S on mortality. Combined with the effect against symptomatic disease, a single dose of either vaccine was about 80% effective at preventing admission to hospital with covid-19 and a single dose of BNT162b2 was 85% effective at preventing death with covid-19. CONCLUSION: Vaccination with either one dose of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1-S was associated with a significant reduction in symptomatic covid-19 in older adults, and with further protection against severe disease. Both vaccines showed similar effects. Protection was maintained for the duration of follow-up (>6 weeks). A second dose of BNT162b2 was associated with further protection against symptomatic disease. A clear effect of the vaccines against the B.1.1.7 variant was found.","Lopez Bernal, Jamie; Andrews, Nick; Gower, Charlotte; Robertson, Chris; Stowe, Julia; Tessier, Elise; Simmons, Ruth; Cottrell, Simon; Roberts, Richard; O039,; Doherty, Mark; Brown, Kevin; Cameron, Claire; Stockton, Diane; McMenamin, Jim; Ramsay, Mary",BMJ,,560
292334,Implementing Telemedicine Visits in an Underserved Ophthalmology Clinic in the COVID-19 Era,2021,"BACKGROUND: hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease due to vascular malformations represents an emergency for neurosurgery and neuro-interventional departments. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a dramatic reduction in the number of hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction or stroke and a larger time interval from symptom onset to first medical contact have been reported. This study aims to verify the hypothesis that there would also have been a reduction of admissions for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease during the Italian lockdown. MATERIAL AND METHOD: s A multicenter, observational survey was conducted to collect data on hospital admissions for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease due to vascular malformations throughout two-months (March 15th to May 15th); the years 2020 (COVID-19 Italian lockdown), 2019 and 2018 were compared. Cases were identified by ICD-9 codes 430, 431, 432.1, 432.9, 747.81 of each hospital database. The statistical significance of the difference between the event rate of one year versus the others was evaluated using Poisson Means test, assuming a constant population. RESULTS: During the 2020 lockdown, the total number of admissions for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease was 92 compared with 116 in 2019 and 95 in 2018. This difference was not significant. GCS upon admission was 3-8 in 44 % of cases in 2020 (41 patients), 39.7 % in 2019 (46 patients) and 28 % in 2018 (27 patients). CONCLUSION: Reduction of admissions for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease due to vascular malformations during the COVID-19 lockdown was not confirmed. Nevertheless, some patients reached the emergency rooms only several days after symptoms onset, resulting in a worse clinical condition at admission.","De Bonis, Pasquale; Cavallo, Michele Alessandro; Sturiale, Carmelo Lucio; Martellucci, Cecilia; Flacco, Maria Elena; Dughiero, Michele; Auricchio, Anna Maria; Ricciardi, Luca; Raco, Antonino; Bortolotti, Carlo; Tosatto, Luigino; D039,; Andrea, Marcello; Ruggiero, Maria; Mongardi, Lorenzo; Zona, Gianluigi; Fiaschi, Pietro; Cofano, Fabio; Garbossa, Diego; Scerrati, Alba",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,,560

In this retrospective cohort study, we investigated whether whole-genome sequencing (WGS) could enhance the epidemiological investigation of healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 acquisition. Methods and findingsFrom 17-November-2020 to 5-January-2021, 803 inpatients and 329 staff were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection across four teaching hospitals in Oxfordshire, UK. We classified cases according to epidemiological definitions, sought epidemiological evidence of a potential source for each nosocomial infection, and evaluated if epidemiologically-linked cases had genomic evidence supporting transmission. We compared epidemiological and genomic outbreak identification. Using national epidemiological definitions, 109/803 (14%) inpatient infections were classified as definite/probable nosocomial, 615 (77%) as community-acquired and 79 (10%) as indeterminate. There was strong epidemiological evidence to support definite/probable cases as nosocomial: 107/109 (98%) had a prior-negative PCR in the same hospital stay before testing positive, and 101(93%) shared time and space with known infected patients/staff. Many indeterminate cases were likely infected in hospital: 53/79 (67%) had a prior-negative PCR and 75 (95%) contact with a potential source. 89/615 (11% of all 803 patients) with apparent community-onset had a recent hospital exposure. WGS highlighted SARS-CoV-2 is mainly imported into hospitals: within 764 samples sequenced 607 genomic clusters were identified (>1 SNP distinct). Only 43/607 (7%) clusters contained evidence of onward transmission (subsequent cases within [≤]1 SNP). 20/21 epidemiologically-identified outbreaks contained multiple genomic introductions. Most (80%) nosocomial acquisition occurred in rapid super-spreading events in settings with a mix of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Hospitals not routinely admitting COVID-19 patients had low rates of transmission. Undiagnosed/unsequenced individuals prevent genomic data from excluding nosocomial acquisition. ConclusionsOur findings suggest current surveillance definitions underestimate nosocomial acquisition and reveal most nosocomial transmission occurs from a relatively limited number of highly infectious individuals.","Lumley, Sheila F; Constantinides, Bede; Sanderson, Nicholas; Rodger, Gillian; Street, Teresa L; Swann, Jeremy; Chau, Kevin K; O039, Denise; Donnell,; Warren, Fiona; Hoosdally, Sarah; laboratory, - OUH Microbiology; team, - OUH Infection Prevention and Control; O039, Anne-Marie; Walker, Timothy M; Stoesser, Nicole E; Butcher, Lisa; Peto, Tim EA; Crook, Derrick W; Jeffery, Katie; Matthews, Philippa C; Eyre, David W",,,560

304631,Information-Seeking Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic Across the United States: Longitudinal Analysis of Google Trends Data,2021,"C-Cbl-associated protein (CAP), also known as Sorbin and SH3 domain-containing protein 1 (Sorbs1) or ponsin, an adaptor protein of the insulin-signalling pathway, mediates anti-viral and anti-cytotoxic protection in acute viral heart disease. In the present study we describe a novel protective immuno-modulatory function of CAP in inflammation. Among the three members of the Sorbs family of adapter molecules, which include CAP (Sorbs1), ArgBP2 (Sorbs2), and Vinexin (Sorbs3), CAP consistently down-regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mouse fibroblasts, cardiomyocytes, and myeloid-derived leukocytes, after Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. Upon the same TLR stimulation, ArgBP2 partially down-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokine production in mouse fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes, while Vinexin rather promoted their production. Mechanistically, CAP limited pro-inflammatory cytokine expression by suppressing the phosphorylation of Inhibitor of kappa B (I&#954;B) kinase (I&#954;&#954;)-&#945; and I&#954;&#954;-ß and their downstream NF-&#954;B-dependent signalling pathway. Molecular affinity between CAP and I&#954;&#954;-&#945;/ I&#954;&#954;-ß was necessary to block the NF-&#954;B pathway. The CAP-dependent inhibitory mechanism - in vivo exclusively IL-6 inhibition - was confirmed after collecting blood from mice with systemic inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and in the heart tissue collected from mice infected with the cardiotropic Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). Taken together, CAP down-regulates pro-inflammatory cytokines by interfering with the normal function of the NF-&#954;B pathway. The promotion of CAP production could support the development of new strategies aiming to limit excessive and detrimental activation of the immune system.","Vdovenko, Daria; Bachmann, Marta; Wijnen, Winandus J; Hottiger, Michael O; Eriksson, Urs; Valaperti, Alan",Int Immunopharmacol,,560

304636,Somatic symptoms and concern regarding COVID-19 among Chinese college and primary school students: A cross-sectional survey,2020,"Learning programming is a complex and challenging task for many students. It involves both understanding theoretical concepts and acquiring practical skills. Hence, analyzing learners’ data from online learning environments alone fails to capture the full breadth of students’ actions if part of their learning process takes place elsewhere. Moreover, existing studies on learning analytics applied to programming education have mainly relied on frequency analysis to classify students according to their approach to programming or to predict academic achievement. However, frequency analysis provides limited insights into the individual time-related characteristics of the learning process. The current study examines students’ strategies when learning programming, combining data from the learning management system and from an automated assessment tool used to support students while solving the programming assignments. The study included the data of 292 engineering students (228 men and 64 women, aged 20–26) from the two aforementioned sources. To gain an in-depth understanding of students’ learning process as well as of the types of learners, we used learning analytics methods that account for the temporal order of learning actions. Our results show that students have special preferences for specific learning resources when learning programming, namely, slides that support search, and copy and paste.

The state and its institutions were forced to take certain measures to facilitate the survival and continuation of business, and to save jobs for entrepreneurs and their employees. The Tax Administration is a state institution whose measures directly affect every business. So it was among the first to take some measures, i.e. to adjust its business and tax collection to the new situation. This paper discusses the first measures introduced, those from March and April 2020. It discusses the deferral or installment payment of due and deferred tax liabilities. The measure of deferral, installment payment of tax liability, is certainly the most important and most popular measure among taxpayers. It is explained how tax measures during a pandemic should look according to the recommendations of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). We explain other measures that have been introduced to facilitate business. These are the extension of the deadlinefor filing income tax, the exemption from VAT, the enforcement procedure and the payment of the annual tax rate. Despite the measures taken so far, it is important to emphasize that the Covid-19 pandemic is still ongoing, and that according to some experts, a real crisis with visible consequences of the pandemic is still to be expected. Accordingly, it is to be expected that the current measures are very likely to be further changed, upgraded and adjusted as the situation changes. We consider it important to note that the framework of this paper does not allow a detailed analysis and that we are forced to limit ourselves exclusively to some aspects of the issue at hand.","Perić, Renata PhD Full Professor Jerković Emina Assistant Professor",EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series,,560
308209,Health Information System's Responses to COVID-19 Pandemic in China: A National Cross-sectional Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted the dynamics of health care and neurosurgical practice. Elective surgeries were suspended for 8 weeks in Kentucky. Our objective was to determine if telehealth (TH) visits could be sustained as an alternative to in-person visits. METHODS: Deidentified data on TH usage, in-person clinic visits, and inpatient and neurosurgical case volumes from March 2, 2020 to June 26, 2020 were obtained for retrospective analysis. RESULTS: TH use increased soon after the case suspension started and then decreased to little usage. The number of in-person visits were significantly lower during elective case suspension compared with when cases were resumed. Twenty-five percent of all visits during the suspension were conducted using TH. Thirty-nine percent of TH-visit patients were new patients, 11% were preoperative, 10% were postoperative, and 39% were other existing patients. Forty-eight percent of TH visits resulted in a later in-person clinic visit. After the suspension, in-person visits rebounded to 98% of the prepandemic numbers and TH visits were low. CONCLUSIONS: TH visits were challenging due to the need for in-person physical examinations in neurosurgery. TH temporarily accommodated patient needs during the pandemic but could not totally replace in-person visits and was not sustained after 3.5 months of use. Video TH visits worked well for nonurgent issues, such as minor visual examinations. Our findings could help guide the implementation of TH should similar circumstances arise again.","Chau, Monica J; Quintero, Jorge E; Guiliani, Ashley; Hines, Tripp; Samaan, Christopher; Seybold, Katie; Stowe, Matthew; Hanlon, Dean; Gerhardth, Greg A; van Horne, Craig G",World Neurosurg,,560

The clinical characteristics, treatment regimen and duration of hospitalization of COVID-19 patients remain unclear in Ghana. Methods: we retrospectively reviewed the secondary data of 307 discharged COVID-19 patients to characterize their demographics, clinical symptoms, treatment regimen given and duration of hospitalization. Results: the mean age and temperature of the patients were 37.9 years and 36.3°C, respectively. The majority (85.7%) of the cases reviewed were asymptomatic; for those presenting with symptoms, the main ones were cough (50%), fever (29.6%), headache (27.3%), and sore throat (22.7%). Comorbidities were present in 25.1% of the patients; the popularly reported comorbidities were hypertension (71.4%), asthma (7.8%) and diabetes (6.5%). The average duration of hospitalization was 13.8 days, and the duration of hospitalization for patients managed with azithromycin + chloroquine (AZ+CQ) was 10.4 days, followed closely by those managed with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) only, 11.0 days. There was longer duration of hospitalization among patients who received AZ only compared to patients receiving AZ + CQ (3.24 ± 1.10 days, p=0.037; 95% CI 0.11, 6.37). Linear regression analysis showed that the duration of hospitalization for patients who received AZ only was 2.7 days, which was higher than that of patients who received AZ+CQ and HCQ only (95% CI 0.44, 4.93; p=0.019). Conclusion: in this cohort of COVID-19 patients, the common symptoms were cough, fever, headache, and sore throat. The use of AZ+CQ or HCQ only as a therapy for managing COVID-19 patients shortened the duration of hospitalization.","Ashinyo, Mary Eyram; Duti, Vida; Dubik, Stephen Dajaan; Amegah, Kingsley Ebenezer; Kutsoati, Selorm; Oduro-Mensah, Ebenezer; Puplampu, Peter; Gyansa-Lutterodt, Martha; Darko, Delese Mimi; Buabeng, Kwame Ohene; Ashinyo, Anthony; Ofosu, Anthony Adofo; Baddoo, Nyonuku Akosua; Akoriyea, Samuel Kaba; Ofei, Francis; Kuma-Aboagye, Patrick",Pan Afr Med J,,560

This article attempts to account for the case when each individual entails in different kinds of interactions which have therefore different probabilities of transmitting the disease. The majority of these results can be also stated in the language of percolation theory. The main contributions of the article are: (1) Extend to this setting some results which were previously known in the case when each individual has only one kind of interactions. (2) Find an explicit formula for the basic reproduction number $R_0$ which depends only on the probabilities of transmitting the disease along the different edges and the first two moments of the degree distributions of the associated graphs. (3) Motivated by the recent Covid-19 pandemic, we use the framework developed to compute the $R_0$ of a model disease spreading in populations whose trees and degree distributions are adjusted to several different countries. In this setting, we shall also compute the probability that the outbreak will not lead to an epidemic.

Here we characterise the differential risk of hospitalisation and death in Sao Paulo state, Brazil, and show how vulnerability to COVID-19 is shaped by socioeconomic inequalities. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using hospitalised severe acute respiratory infections notified from March to August 2020 in the Sistema de Monitoramento Inteligente de Sao Paulo database. We examined the risk of hospitalisation and death by race and socioeconomic status using multiple data sets for individual-level and spatiotemporal analyses. We explained these inequalities according to differences in daily mobility from mobile phone data, teleworking behaviour and comorbidities. RESULTS: Throughout the study period, patients living in the 40% poorest areas were more likely to die when compared with patients living in the 5% wealthiest areas (OR: 1.60, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.74) and were more likely to be hospitalised between April and July 2020 (OR: 1.08, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.12). Black and Pardo individuals were more likely to be hospitalised when compared with White individuals (OR: 1.41, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.46;OR: 1.26, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.28, respectively), and were more likely to die (OR: 1.13, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.19;1.07, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.10, respectively) between April and July 2020. Once hospitalised, patients treated in public hospitals were more likely to die than patients in private hospitals (OR: 1.40%, 95% CI 1.34% to 1.46%).

However, heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 testing may introduce biased estimates depending on analytic design. We aimed to explore the potential for collider bias in a large study of disease determinants, and evaluate individual, environmental and social determinants associated with SARS-CoV-2 testing and diagnosis among residents of Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We explored the potential for collider bias and characterized individual, environmental and social determinants of being tested and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection using cross-sectional analyses among 14.7 million community-dwelling people in Ontario, Canada. Among those with a diagnosis, we used separate analytic designs to compare predictors of people testing positive versus negative; symptomatic people testing positive versus testing negative; and people testing positive versus people not testing positive (i.e., testing negative or not being tested). Our analyses included tests conducted between Mar. 1 and June 20, 2020. RESULTS: Of 14 695 579 people, we found that 758 691 were tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 25 030 (3.3%) had a positive test result. The further the odds of testing from the null, the more variability we generally observed in the odds of diagnosis across analytic design, particularly among individual factors. We found that there was less variability in testing by social determinants across analytic designs. Residing in areas with the highest household density (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.75-1.98), highest proportion of essential workers (adjusted OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.48-1.69), lowest educational attainment (adjusted OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.26-1.41) and highest proportion of recent immigrants (adjusted OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.05-1.15) were consistently related to increased odds of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis regardless of analytic design. INTERPRETATION: Where testing is limited, our results suggest that risk factors may be better estimated using population comparators rather than test-negative comparators. Optimizing COVID-19 responses necessitates investment in and sufficient coverage of structural interventions tailored to heterogeneity in social determinants of risk, including household crowding, occupation and structural racism.","Sundaram, Maria E; Calzavara, Andrew; Mishra, Sharmistha; Kustra, Rafal; Chan, Adrienne K; Hamilton, Mackenzie A; Djebli, Mohamed; Rosella, Laura C; Watson, Tristan; Chen, Hong; Chen, Branson; Baral, Stefan D; Kwong, Jeffrey C",CMAJ,,560

The model is sufficiently rich to incorporate specific characteristics of the novel coronavirus, to capture the impact of undetected, asymptomatic and super-diffusive individuals, and especially to take into account time-varying counter-measures and detection efforts. Yet, it is simple enough to allow scalable and efficient computation of the temporal evolution of the epidemic, and exploration of what-if scenarios. Compared to traditional compartmental models, our approach allows a more faithful description of virus specific features, such as distributions for the time spent in stages, which is crucial when the time-scale of control (e.g., mobility restrictions) is comparable to the lifetime of a single infection. We apply the model to the first and second wave of COVID-19 in Italy, shedding light onto several effects related to mobility restrictions introduced by the government, and to the effectiveness of contact tracing and mass testing performed by the national health service.","Garetto, Michele; Leonardi, Emilio; Torrisi, Giovanni Luca",Annual reviews in control,,560

We employ the epidemic renormalisation group approach to pandemics, together with the first wave data for COVID-19, to efficiently simulate the dynamics of disease transmission and spreading across different European countries. The framework allows us to model, not only inter and extra European border control effects, but also the impact of social distancing for each country. We perform statistical analyses averaging on different level of human interaction across Europe and with the rest of the world. Our results are neatly summarised as an animation reporting the time evolution of the first and second waves of the European COVID-19 pandemic.

Based on 17,123 and 8693 emergency attendance for stroke and AMI, an interrupted time-series (ITS) study was conducted. Since 01/24/2020, the top two levels of regulations on major public health have been implemented in Beijing. This study covered from 03/01/2018 to 06/03/2020, including 19 weeks of lockdown period and 99 weeks before. A segmented Poisson regression model was used to estimate the immediate change and the monthly change in the secular trend of the emergency attendance rates. The emergency attendance rates of stroke and AMI cut in half at the beginning of the lockdown period, with 52.1% (95% CI 45.8% to 57.7%) and 63.1% (95% CI 56.1% to 63.1%) immediate decreases for stroke and AMI, respectively. Then during the lockdown period, 7.0% (95% CI 2.5%, 11.6%) and 16.1% (95% CI 9.5, 23.1) increases per month in the secular trends of emergency attendance rates were shown for stroke and AMI, respectively. Though the accelerated increasing rates, there were estimated 1335 and 747 patients with stroke and AMI without seeking emergency medical aid during the lockdown, respectively. The emergency attendance for stroke and AMI cut in half at the beginning of the pandemic then had gradual restoration thereafter. The results hint the need for more engagement and communications with all stakeholders to reduce the negative impact on CVD emergency medical services during the crisis.","Wu, Yiqun; Chen, Fei; Sun, Zhaobin; Zhang, Yingxian; Song, Yafang; Feng, Wuwei; Wang, Yuping; Liu, Ying; Song, Haiqing",J. thromb. thrombolysis,,560

As in similar cases in the past, also with this one, the main interest is on the ""first response"". Fully appreciating the efforts of those risking their lives facing pandemics, this paper tries to identify the main elements of the larger, possibly global, framework, supported by international standards, needed to deal with new (emerging) risks resulting from threats like Corona and assess the resilience of systems affected. The paper proposes that future solutions should include a number of new elements, related to both risk and resilience. That should include broadening the scope of attention, currently focused onto preparation and response phases, to the phases of ""understanding risks"", including emerging risks, and transformation and adaptation. The paper suggests to use resilience indicators in this process. The proposed approach has been applied in different cases involving critical infrastructures in Europe (energy supply, water supply, transportation, etc., exposed to various threats), including the health system in Austria. The detailed, indicator-based, resilience analysis included mapping resilience, resilience stress-testing, visualization, etc., showing, already before the COVID-19, the resilience (stress-testing) limits of the infrastructures. A simpler (57 indicator based) analysis has, then been done for 11 countries (including Austria). The paper links these results with the options available in the area of policies, standards, guidelines and tools (such as the RiskRadar), with focus on interdependencies and global standards-especially the new ISO 31,050, linking emerging risks and resilience.","Jovanovic, A; Klimek, P; Renn, O; Schneider, R; Øien, K; Brown, J; DiGennaro, M; Liu, Y; Pfau, V; Jelic, M; Rosen, T; Caillard, B; Chakravarty, S; Chhantyal, P",Environ Syst Decis,,560

They are being considered as potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets in cancer studies. Here, we have assessed the importance of CYTOR (linc00152) as a biomarker for the detection of breast cancer in both tumoral tissue and plasma. The relative expression of breast cancer-associated CYTOR was measured in 20 tumoral and paired margin tissues, and moreover, in 80 plasma samples by real-time-polymerase chain reaction. In addition, plasma levels of CA 15-3 were measured using the ELISA test. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was applied for assessing the sensitivity and specificity of tested biomarkers. The results of the present study disclosed significantly increases in the CYTOR expression levels in tumor tissue with relative quantitation (RQ) equals to 5.15 (P<0.001) and in plasma (RQ =3.03, P<0.01) of breast cancer patients. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of circulating CYTOR was 0.907 (95% CI: 0.842-0.972, P<0.001), while it was 0.868 (95% CI: 0.783-0.952, P<0.001) for CA 15-3.

Although the pathogenesis of UC is multifactorial, growing evidence has demonstrated that gut microbiota and its metabolites are closely related to the development of UC. Lizhong decoction (LZD), a well-known classical Chinese herbal prescription, has been used to clinically treat UC for long time, but its mechanism is not clear. In this study, 16S rRNA gene sequencing combining with untargeted metabolomics profiling was used to investigate how LZD worked. Results indicated that LZD could shape the gut microbiota structure and modify metabolic profiles. The abundance of opportunistic pathogens such as Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Enterobacter, and Escherichia-Shigella correlated with intestinal inflammation markedly decreased, while the levels of beneficial bacteria including Blautia, Muribaculaceae_norank, Prevotellaceae UCG-001, and Ruminiclostridium 9 elevated in various degrees. Additionally, fecal metabolite profiles reflecting microbial activities showed that adenosine, lysoPC(18:0), glycocholic acid, and deoxycholic acid notably decreased, while cholic acid, &#945;-linolenic acid, stearidonic acid, and L-tryptophan significantly increased after LZD treatment. Hence, based on the systematic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics of gut flora, the results provided a novel insight that microbiota and its metabolites might be potential targets for revealing the mechanism of LZD on amelioration of UC.Key Points â¢ The potential mechanism of LZD on the amelioration of UC was firstly investigated.â¢ LZD could significantly shape the structure of gut microbiota.â¢ LZD could notably modulate the fecal metabolic profiling of UC mice.

Questioning focussed on social isolation and desire to interact with others before and since COVID-19; effects of safety measures including personal protective equipment and social distancing; and perceived influences of the pandemic on service users and social aspects of service delivery. All employees at an English NHS mental health service were invited to complete an anonymous online questionnaire (July-September 2020), resulting in 464 completed questionnaires. Response frequencies were summed across the total sample, and the influence of patient contact, age, and vulnerability to COVID-19 were explored using pairwise comparisons. Approximately two thirds of employees felt there had been a fundamental change in how they felt about interacting with others, and many had lost confidence in their ability to relate emotionally to others. Respondents were keen to adhere to safety guidance, but the majority believed that face masks and social distancing could have a detrimental effect on communication and rapport within the workplace. Other concerns included passing on the virus, social isolation of employees and service users, and a reduction in community services. COVID-19 safety measures may impact morale, communication, empathy, and the provision of client-centred care. More generally, the pandemic has changed the attitudes of mental health workers towards social interaction, with younger employees reporting more mental health difficulties that may be linked to concerns about longer term social change.","Eddy, Clare M",Int. j. ment. health nurs,,560

In this study, we performed an extensive multi-omics data mining and identified four insulin-like peptide genes, including ILP, MIRP3, MIRP3-like and ILP7, in the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. Their potential roles in growth regulation were further investigated using the selectively bred fast-growing C. gigas variety ""Haida No.1"". Expression profiling and in situ hybridization of these insulin-like peptides suggested their distinct tissue-specific expression pattern, with dominant expression in the neural enrichment tissues such as labial palp, visceral ganglia, adductor muscle, and digestive gland. The expressions of insulin-like peptides were significantly altered by food abundance in a gene-specific fashion. The expression of ILP was reduced during fasting and increased after re-feeding, the expression of MIRP3 and ILP7 were generally induced during fasting and down-regulated after re-feeding, while the expression of MIRP3-like was firstly up-regulated and then down-regulated during the fasting and re-feeding process. Furthermore, the expressions of all four insulin-like peptide genes were significantly suppressed at low temperature, in accordance with the growth inhibition. These results indicated that all four insulin-like peptides would play critical but different roles in regulation of growth in the oysters. This work provides valuable information for further investigation on growth regulation mechanism in mollusks and molecular assisted breeding of growth with other production traits in the Pacific oyster.","Li, Yongjing; Fu, Huiru; Zhang, Fuqiang; Ren, Liting; Tian, Jing; Li, Qi; Liu, Shikai",Gene,,560
350777,Clinician Experience with Telemedicine at a Safety-net Hospital Network during COVID-19: A Cross-sectional Survey,2021,"The high number of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus requiring care for ARDS puts sedation in the critical care unit (CCU) to the edge. Depth of sedation has evolved over the last 40 years (no-sedation, deep sedation, daily emergence, minimal sedation, etc.). Most guidelines now recommend determining the depth of sedation and minimizing the use of benzodiazepines and opioids. The broader use of alpha-2 adrenergic agonists ('alpha-2 agonists') led to sedation regimens beginning at admission to the CCU that contrast with hypnotics+opioids (""conventional"" sedation), with major consequences for cognition, ventilation and circulatory performance. The same doses of alpha-2 agonists used for 'cooperative' sedation (ataraxia, analgognosia) elicit no respiratory depression but modify the autonomic nervous system (cardiac parasympathetic activation, attenuation of excessive cardiac and vasomotor sympathetic activity). Alpha-2 agonists should be selected only in patients who benefit from their effects ('personalized' indications, as opposed to a 'one size fits all' approach). Then, titration to effect is required, especially in the setting of systemic hypotension and/or hypovolemia. Since no general guidelines exist for the use of alpha-2 agonists for CCU sedation, our clinical experience is summarized for the benefit of physicians in clinical situations in which a recommendation might never exist (refractory delirium tremens;unstable, hypovolemic, hypotensive patients, etc.). Because the physiology of alpha-2 receptors and the pharmacology of alpha-2 agonists lead to personalized indications, some details are offered.

352811,"The Experiences and Perceptions of Health-Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Muscat, Oman: A Qualitative Study",2020,"To evaluate the aquatic hazards of the insect juvenile hormone analogue fenoxycarb, a single application (0, 48.8, 156.3, 500, 1600, and 5120 µg/L) of it was done in indoor freshwater systems dominated by Daphnia carinata (daphnid) and Dolerocypris sinensis (ostracoda). The responses of zooplankton (counted by abundance and the activity and immuno-reactive content of free N-Acetyl-ß-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase)), phytoplankton (counted by chlorophyll and phycocyanin), planktonic bacteria and fungi, and some water quality parameters were investigated in a period of 35 d. Results of the study showed that the ostracoda was more sensitive than daphnid, with time-weighted average (TWA)-based no observed effect concentrations (NOECs) to be 8.45 and 12.66 µg/L in systems without humic acid addition (HA-) and to be 6.37 and 9.54 µg/L in systems with humic acid addition (HA+). The duration of treatment-related effects in the ostracoda population was longer than the daphnid population (21 vs. 14 days). Besides, the data analysis indicated that the toxicity of fenoxycarb was significantly enhanced in the HA+ systems. Owing to the reduced grazing pressure, the concentrations of chlorophyll and phycocyanin increased in the two highest treatments. The increase in photosynthesis along with a reduced animal excretion led to an increase in pH and a decrease in nutrient contents. These changes seemed to have an effect on the microbial communities. For example, the abundances of some opportunistic pathogens of aquatic animals (e.g. Aeromonas and Cladosporium) and organic-pollutant-degrading microorganisms (e.g. Ancylobacter and Azospirillum) increased significantly in microbial communities, but the abundances of Pedobacter, Candidatus Planktoluna, and Rhodobacter (photosynthetic bacteria) markedly decreased. This study provides useful information to understand the ecotoxicological impacts of fenoxycarb at the population and community levels while integrating the effects of HA on toxicity.","Lu, Yu; Li, Shaonan; Sha, Meng; Wang, Biao; Cheng, Gong; Guo, Yirong; Zhu, Jinwen",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,560

We aimed to report the available evidence regarding ceftobiprole use in pneumonia and invasive bacterial infections, shedding light on ceftobiprole stewardship. The clinical application and real-life experiences of using ceftobiprole for bloodstream infections, including infective endocarditis, are limited but nevertheless promising. In addition, extended-spectrum ceftobiprole activity, including Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, has theoretical advantages for use as empirical therapy in bacteremia potentially caused by a broad spectrum of microorganisms, such as catheter-related bacteremia. In the future, the desirable approach to sepsis and severe infections will be administered to patients according to their clinical situation, the intrinsic host characteristics, the susceptibility profile, and local epidemiology, while the “universal antibiotic strategy” will no longer be adequate.","Lupia, Tommaso Pallotto Carlo Corcione Silvia Boglione Lucio De Rosa Francesco Giuseppe",Antibiotics,,560

355761,Digital Response During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Saudi Arabia,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has impacted more than 200 countries. However in the USA, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been politically polarized. The objective of this study is to investigate the association between political partisanship and COVID-19 deaths rates in the USA. METHODS: This study used longitudinal county-level panel data, segmented into 10 30-day time periods, consisting of all counties in the USA, from 22 January 2020 to 5 December 2020. The outcome measure is the total number of COVID-19 deaths per 30-day period. The key explanatory variable is county political partisanship, dichotomized as Democratic or Republican. The analysis used a ZINB regression. RESULTS: When compared with Republican counties, COVID-19 death rates in Democratic counties were significantly higher (IRRs ranged from 2.0 to 18.3, P < 0.001) in Time 1-Time 5, but in Time 9-Time10, were significantly lower (IRRs ranged from 0.43 to 0.69, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The reversed trend in COVID-19 death rates between Democratic and Republican counties was influenced by the political polarized response to the pandemic. The findings support the necessity of evidence-based public health leadership and management in maneuvering the USA out of the current COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for future public health crises.","Chen, Hsueh-Fen; Karim, Saleema A",J. public health (Oxf),,560

In this study, we report clinical and microbiological features of ten COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário (CHCSJ) between January 21 to February 16, 2020. Clinical samples from all patients including nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)/sputum, urine, and feces were collected for serial virus RNA testing by standard qRT-PCR assay. In total, seven were imported cases and three were local cases. The median duration from Macau arrival to admission in imported cases was 3 days. Four patients required oxygen therapy but none of them needed machinal ventilation. No fatal cases were noted. The most common symptoms were fever (80%) and diarrhea (80%). In the ""Severe"" group, there was significantly more elderly patients (p=0.045), higher lactate dehydrogenase levels (p=0.002), and elevated C-Reactive protein levels compared to the ""Mild to Moderate"" group (p<0.001). There were positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA signals in all patients' NPS and stool specimens but negative in all urine specimens. Based on our data on SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in stool and the possibility of a lag in viral detection in NPS specimens, the assessment of both fecal and respiratory specimen is recommended to enhance diagnostic sensitivity, and also to aid discharge decision before the role of viral RNA shedding in stool is clarified.","Lo, Iek Long; Lio, Chon Fu; Cheong, Hou Hon; Lei, Chin Ion; Cheong, Tak Hong; Zhong, Xu; Tian, Yakun; Sin, Nin Ngan",Int J Biol Sci,,560
356419,Effects of the COVID-19 imposed lockdown in adults with ADHD: a cross-sectional survey,2020,"BACKGROUND: LY-CoV555, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody, has been associated with a decrease in viral load and the frequency of hospitalizations or emergency department visits among outpatients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Data are needed on the effect of this antibody in patients who are hospitalized with Covid-19. METHODS: In this platform trial of therapeutic agents, we randomly assigned hospitalized patients who had Covid-19 without end-organ failure in a 1:1 ratio to receive either LY-CoV555 or matching placebo. In addition, all the patients received high-quality supportive care as background therapy, including the antiviral drug remdesivir and, when indicated, supplemental oxygen and glucocorticoids. LY-CoV555 (at a dose of 7000 mg) or placebo was administered as a single intravenous infusion over a 1-hour period. The primary outcome was a sustained recovery during a 90-day period, as assessed in a time-to-event analysis. An interim futility assessment was performed on the basis of a seven-category ordinal scale for pulmonary function on day 5. RESULTS: On October 26, 2020, the data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping enrollment for futility after 314 patients (163 in the LY-CoV555 group and 151 in the placebo group) had undergone randomization and infusion. The median interval since the onset of symptoms was 7 days (interquartile range, 5 to 9). At day 5, a total of 81 patients (50%) in the LY-CoV555 group and 81 (54%) in the placebo group were in one of the two most favorable categories of the pulmonary outcome. Across the seven categories, the odds ratio of being in a more favorable category in the LY-CoV555 group than in the placebo group was 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 1.29; P = 0.45). The percentage of patients with the primary safety outcome (a composite of death, serious adverse events, or clinical grade 3 or 4 adverse events through day 5) was similar in the LY-CoV555 group and the placebo group (19% and 14%, respectively; odds ratio, 1.56; 95% CI, 0.78 to 3.10; P = 0.20). The rate ratio for a sustained recovery was 1.06 (95% CI, 0.77 to 1.47). CONCLUSIONS: Monoclonal antibody LY-CoV555, when coadministered with remdesivir, did not demonstrate efficacy among hospitalized patients who had Covid-19 without end-organ failure.

Enhancers within the 1.45 Mb cluster exhibit highly synergistic activity that is dependent on the Coordinator motif. Using mouse models, we demonstrate that PRS phenotypic specificity arises from the convergence of two mechanisms: confinement of Sox9 dosage perturbation to developing facial structures through context-specific enhancer activity and heightened sensitivity of the lower jaw to Sox9 expression reduction. Overall, we characterize the longest-range human enhancers involved in congenital malformations, directly demonstrate that PRS is an enhanceropathy, and illustrate how small changes in gene expression can lead to morphological variation.","Long, Hannah K; Osterwalder, Marco; Welsh, Ian C; Hansen, Karissa; Davies, James O J; Liu, Yiran E; Koska, Mervenaz; Adams, Alexander T; Aho, Robert; Arora, Neha; Ikeda, Kazuya; Williams, Ruth M; Sauka-Spengler, Tatjana; Porteus, Matthew H; Mohun, Tim; Dickel, Diane E; Swigut, Tomek; Hughes, Jim R; Higgs, Douglas R; Visel, Axel; Selleri, Licia; Wysocka, Joanna",,,560

METHODS: This was an observational study performed using a life-size head model to simulate tonsil surgery and fluorescein-soaked strawberries to mimic tonsils. The Coblation wand was activated over the strawberries for 5 minutes. This was repeated 5 times with 2 surgeons (totalling 10 data sets). The presence of droplet around the surgical field and anatomical subsites on the surgeon was assessed in binary fashion: present or not present. The results were collated as frequency of droplet detection and illustrated as a heatmap; 0 = white, 1-2 = yellow, 3-4 = orange, and 5 = red. RESULTS: Fluorescein droplets were detected in all 4 quadrants of the surgical field. The frequency of splatter was greatest in the upper (nearest to surgeon) and lower quadrants. There were detectable splatter droplets on the surgeon; most frequently occurring on the hands followed by the forearm. Droplets were also detected on the visor, neck, and chest albeit less frequently. However, none were detected on the upper arms. CONCLUSION: Droplet splatter can be detected in the immediate surgical field as well as on the surgeon. Although wearing a face visor does not prevent splatter on the surgical mask or around the eyes, it should be considered when undertaking tonsil surgery as well as a properly fitted goggle.

When the outbreak became too severe to be kept from the public in January 2020, Chinese authorities radically changed their stance and started to battle COVID-19 with intensive efforts, facing the double challenge of a legitimacy crisis and the uncertain virus. Expanded surveillance protocols were established while intensive surveillance practices were introduced and mobilized. Many locations reported that people who had been wanted by the police for years were turning themselves in, as expanded and routinized surveillance made it more difficult for them to hide.

372469,"Knowledge, attitude, and practices among police force toward covid-19 pandemic during Lockdown in Pune, India - An Online cross-sectional survey",2021,"RATIONALE: Patients with severe COVID-19 have complex organ support needs that necessitate prolonged stays in the intensive care, likely to result in a high incidence of neuromuscular weakness and loss of well being. Early and structured rehabilitation has been associated with improved outcomes for patients requiring prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation, but at present no data are available to describe similar interventions or outcomes in COVID-19 populations. OBJECTIVES: To describe the demographics, clinical status, level of rehabilitation and mobility status at ICU discharge of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Adults admitted to ICU with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and mechanically ventilated for >24 hours were included. Rehabilitation status was measured daily using the Manchester Mobility Score (MMS) to identify the time taken to first mobilise (defined as sitting on the edge of the bed or higher) and highest level of mobility achieved at ICU discharge. RESULTS: A total of n=177 patients were identified, of whom n=110 survived to ICU discharge and were included in the subsequent analysis. Whilst on ICU, patients required prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation (mean 19 ± 10 days), most received neuromuscular blockade (90%) and 67% were placed in the prone position on at least one occasion. The mean ± SD time to first mobilise was 14 ± 7 days, with a median MMS at ICU discharge of 5 (interquartile range: 4-6), which represents participants able to stand and step round to a chair with or without assistance. Time to mobilise was significantly longer in those with higher BMI (p<0.001), whilst older patients (p=0.012) and those with more comorbidities (p=0.017) were more likely to require further rehabilitation post-discharge. CONCLUSION: The early experience of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK resembles the experience in other countries, with high acuity of illness and prolonged period of mechanical ventilation required for those patients admitted to ICU. Whilst the time to commence rehabilitation was delayed due to this severity of illness, rehabilitation was possible within the ICU, and led to increased levels of mobility from waking prior to ICU discharge.

373747,An Acute Stress Scale for Health Care Professionals Caring for Patients With COVID-19: Validation Study,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health emergency. According to the findings, male patients with COVID-19 infection are at an increased risk for severe complications than females. The causes of this issue are unknown and are most probably multifactorial. Sexual hormones affect the immune system, so estrogen strengthens the immune system, and testosterone suppresses it. Due to the reports of the high prevalence of androgenic alopecia in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and a higher risk of respiratory disease and increased use of allergy/asthma medications among patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) as a hyperandrogenism condition compared with non-PCOS women, this review aimed to evaluate androgens role in COVID-19. METHODS: 42 related articles from 2008 to 2020 were reviewed with the keywords of androgens, hormonal factors, and hair loss in combination with COVID-19 in medical research databases. RESULTS: The evidence of transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) expression in lung tissue, which is an androgen-regulated gene and expressed mainly in the adult prostate may interpret the increased susceptibility of the male gender to severe COVID-19 complications. Moreover, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) acts as a functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and male hormones are effective in the ACE-2 passageway and simplify SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. CONCLUSION: Further studies on the severity of symptoms in patients with COVID-19 in other hyperandrogenism conditions compared to the control group are recommended.","Moradi, Fatemeh; Enjezab, Behnaz; Ghadiri-Anari, Akram",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,560
374644,The association between screen time and mental health during COVID-19: A cross sectional study,2020,"How human respiratory physiology and the transport phenomena associated with inhaled airflow in the upper airway proceed to impact transmission of SARS-CoV-2, leading to the initial infection, stays an open question. An answer can help determine the susceptibility of an individual on exposure to a COVID-2019 carrier and can also provide a preliminary projection of the still-unknown infectious dose for the disease. Computational fluid mechanics enabled tracking of respiratory transport in medical imaging-based anatomic domains shows that the regional deposition of virus-laden inhaled droplets at the initial nasopharyngeal infection site peaks for the droplet size range of approximately 2.5-19 [Formula: see text]. Through integrating the numerical findings on inhaled transmission with sputum assessment data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients and earlier measurements of ejecta size distribution generated during regular speech, this study further reveals that the number of virions that may go on to establish the SARS-CoV-2 infection in a subject could merely be in the order of hundreds.","Basu, Saikat",Sci Rep,,560
375259,Does pulmonary subspecialty referral from primary care affect the adherence to vaccination recommendations in COPD patients?,2021,"In this era of industrial revolution (IR 4.0), coupled with the emergence of the deadly global pandemic of COVID-19, healthcare organizations are compelled to embrace new technologies for their routine decision-making. The Business Intelligence System (BIS) is one of the emphasized innovations, and due to its potential to provide more intellectual information for decision-making processes, has attracted the interest of industry analysts and policymakers. Literature suggests that the BIS is integrated by organizations in different sectors, but most BIS initiatives struggle to produce the anticipated outcomes. Moreover, the adoption of BIS in SMEs generally and healthcare specifically is rather insignificant. This is due to numerous factors. It is therefore necessary to discover and analyze the essential determinants affecting the adoption of BIS in healthcare SMEs. Therefore, this study tries to tackle this gap by exploring the relevant factors for BIS adoption using a systematic literature review (SLR) and an expert-ranking survey of 63 studies that were published in Scopus and WoS databases from 2011 to 2020. A total of 22 determinants are identified and sent to 15 experts. The data that were gathered from these experts were analyzed using SPSS. The results of the analysis indicated 15 determinants were significant, and one determinant was added by an expert. Consequently, a theoretical structure has been developed based on technology, organization, environment, and CEOs determinants and theories. The results of the current study will deepen the current BIS literature and advance the understanding of the significant elements of BIS adoption decision. © 2021 The Author(s).

COVID-19 has accelerated this adoption and illustrated the challenges that lie ahead as we make this shift. The diverse ecosystem of digital health tools share one feature in common: they generate data which must be processed, triaged, acted upon and incorporated into the longitudinal electronic health record. Critical abnormal findings must be identified and acted upon rapidly, while semi-urgent and non-critical data and trends may be reviewed within a less urgent timeline. Clinically irrelevant findings, which presently comprise a significant percentage of the alerts, ideally would be removed to optimize the high cost, high value resource; i.e., the clinicians' attention and time. We need to transform our established health care infrastructure, technologies and workflows to be able to safely, effectively and efficiently manage the vast quantities of data that these tools will generate. This must include both new technologies from industry as well as expert consensus documents from medical specialty societies including the Heart Rhythm Society. Ultimately, research will be fundamental to inform effective development and implementation of these tools.","Slotwiner, David J; Al-Khatib, Sana M",,,560

382324,Knowledge and Information Sources About COVID-19 Among University Students in Jordan: A Cross-Sectional Study,2020,"This narrative review provides a summary of the impact of tobacco smoking on the respiratory system and the benefits of smoking cessation. Tobacco smoking is one of the leading preventable causes of death world-wide and a major risk factor for lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Smoking is also associated with an increased risk of respiratory infections and appears to be related to poorer outcomes among those with COVID-19. Non-smokers with second-hand smoke exposure also experience significant adverse respiratory effects. Smoking imposes enormous health- and non-health-related costs to societies. The benefits of smoking cessation, in both prevention and management of respiratory disease, have been known for decades and, to this day, cessation support remains one of the most important cost-effective interventions that health professionals can provide to people who smoke. Cessation at any age confers substantial health benefits, even in smokers with established morbidities. As other treatments for chronic respiratory disease advance and survival rates increase, smoking cessation treatment will become even more relevant. While smoking cessation interventions are available, the offer of these by clinicians and uptake by patients remain limited.

We prove that irradiation of aqueous suspensions of poly(vinylpyrrolidone)-coated silver nanoplates (PVPAgNP) or PVPAgNP in HeLa cells with red or NIR lasers causes a sizeable photothermal effect, which in cells can be visualized with the temperature sensing fluorophore Rhodamine B (RhB) using spinning disk confocal fluorescence microscopy or fluorescence lifetime imaging. Upon red-light irradiation of cells that were incubated with both, RhB and PVPAgNP at concentrations with no adverse effects on cell viability, a substantial heat release is detected. Initiation of cell death by photothermal effect is observed by positive signals of fluorescent markers for early and late apoptosis. Surprisingly, a new nanomaterial-assisted cell killing mode is operating when PVPAgNP-loaded HeLa cells are excited with moderate powers of fs-pulsed NIR light. Small roundish areas are generated with bright and fast (<1 ns) decaying emission, which expand fast and destroy the whole cell in seconds. This characteristic emission is assigned to efficient optical breakdown initiation around the strongly absorbing PVPAgNP leading to plasma formation that spreads fast through the cell.","Rivas Aiello, María Belén; Azcárate, Julio C; Zelaya, Eugenia; David Gara, Pedro; Bosio, Gabriela N; Gensch, Thomas; Mártire, Daniel O",Biomaterials science,,560

Customer satisfaction with airlines and airport performance is considerably influenced by how much flights are delayed. But how should the delay be quantified with thousands of flights for each airport and airline? Here, we present a statistical analysis of arrival delays at several UK airports between 2018 and 2020. We establish a procedure to compare both mean delay and extreme events among airlines and airports, identifying a power-law decay of large delays. Furthermore, we note drastic changes in plane delay statistics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we find that delays are described by a superposition of simple distributions, leading to a superstatistics.","Mitsokapas, Evangelos; Schafer, Benjamin; Harris, Rosemary J.; Beck, Christian",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10789v3.pdf,560

In general, children with the coronavirus disease-2019 have been reported to show milder respiratory symptoms as a respiratory infection than adult patients. Here, we describe SARS-CoV-2 infection in an infant who presented with a severe episode of apparent life-threatening event (ALTE). An 8-month-old otherwise healthy infant who was transported to our hospital because of a sudden cardiopulmonary arrest. Approximately one hour before this episode, she was almost fine but in a slightly worse humor than usual. On arrival at our hospital, sever acidosis but no clear sign of inflammatory response was denoted. A chest computed tomography scan showed weak consolidations in the upper right lung as well as atelectasis in the lower left lung. No sign of congenital heart disease or cardiomyopathy was observed in echocardiography, and no significant arrhythmia was observed in the later clinical course. Of note, the specific SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in both of her tracheal aspirate and urine sample by real-time RT-PCR. Although further accumulation of the cases is indispensable, our case suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be one of the underlying factors in the pathophysiology of ALTE.","Sano, Fumikazu; Yagasaki, Hideaki; Kojika, Satoru; Toda, Takako; Kono, Yosuke; Suzuki-Inoue, Katsue; Sasaki, Tomoyuki; Ogihara, Shinji; Matsuno, Towa; Inoue, Osamu; Moriguchi, Takeshi; Harii, Norikazu; Goto, Junko; Shimizu, Tatsuya; Inukai, Takeshi",Jpn. j. infect. dis,,560
392507,'Self-collected upper respiratory tract swabs for COVID-19 test': A feasible way to increase overall testing rate and conserve resources in South Africa,2020,"PROBLEM: The speed and scope of the upheaval that COVID-19 inflicted on medical education made innovation a necessity. While medical students wanted high-quality, consolidated educational resources on COVID-19, the medical school faculty who typically produced such resources were increasingly burdened with clinical, administrative, and personal commitments. However, students eager to contribute to the pandemic response were well-suited to create these instructional materials for their peers. APPROACH: In mid-March 2020, a group of students at Harvard Medical School came together to synthesize the key facts and collate the best existing educational materials about the COVID-19 pandemic into a unified learning resource. The materials were faculty reviewed and shared freely online. The curriculum now contains 8 modules that are updated regularly. Throughout this process, the student authors prioritized accessibility, iterative improvement, and effective pedagogy. OUTCOMES: To date, nearly 80,000 users from 132 countries have accessed the curriculum. It has been referenced or incorporated into courses at Harvard Medical School and more than 30 other medical schools across the country. About 40% of all users are from outside the United States, and the materials have been translated into 28 languages. This effort has spurred a number of other educational initiatives led by medical student groups in the United States and abroad. NEXT STEPS: As understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic is constantly changing, the student authors' immediate goal is to keep the curriculum up to date in the months to come. They plan to maintain existing partnerships with medical schools and student groups around the world while pursuing new opportunities to expand the curriculum's reach, provide education, and build community. Students and educators alike should leverage student-driven education efforts to benefit other learners both within and importantly beyond their institutions.","Kochis, Michael; Goessling, Wolfram",Acad. med,,560

This case highlights a problematic ethical double standard in multinational clinical research: trials that would be considered unethical in high income countries (e.g., placebo-controlled where there is an existing treatment) are nonetheless justified in low-and-middle-income countries because the existing standards of care are less (i.e., no access to a treatment). Underlying this ethical double standard in some multinational clinical trials is a moral imperialism and persistent colonialist thinking that must be rejected.","Hellmann, Fernando; Williams-Jones, Bryn; Garrafa, Volnei",Arch Med Res,,560

Patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection were assigned to recovery group if they made a full recovery and to death group if they died within 2 months of hospitalization. Chest CT examinations for ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, and fibrosis were scored by two reviewers. The total CT score comprised the sum of lung involvement (5 lobes, scores 1-5 for each lobe, range; 0, none; 25, maximum). 40 patients who recovered from COVID-19 and six patients who died were enrolled. The initial chest CTs showed 27 (58.7%) patients had ground-glass opacity, 19 (41.3%) had ground glass and consolidation, and 35 (76.1%) patients had crazy-paving pattern. None of the patients who died had fibrosis in contrast to six (15%) patients who recovered from COVID-19. Most patients had subpleural lesions (89.0%) as well as bilateral (87.0%) and lower (93.0%) lung lobe involvement. Diffuse lesions were present in four (67%) patients who succumbed to coronavirus but only one (2.5%) patient who recovered (p < 0.001). In the death group of patients, the total CT score was higher than that of the recovery group (p = 0.005). Patients in the death group had lower lymphocyte count and higher C-reactive protein than those in the recovery group (p = 0.011 and p = 0.041, respectively). A high CT score and diffuse distribution of lung lesions in COVID-19 are indicative of disease severity and short-term mortality.","Lei, Qiang; Li, Guangming; Ma, Xiaofen; Tian, Junzhang; Wu, Yun Fan; Chen, Hui; Xu, Wen; Li, Cheng; Jiang, Guihua",Sci Rep,,560

The whole world is trying to overcome this pandemic situation. A better health care quality may help a country to tackle the pandemic. Making clusters of countries with similar types of health care quality provides an insight into the quality of health care in different countries. In the area of machine learning and data science, the K-means clustering algorithm is typically used to create clusters based on similarity. In this paper, we propose an efficient K-means clustering method that determines the initial centroids of the clusters efficiently. Based on this proposed method, we have determined health care quality clusters of countries utilizing the COVID-19 datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method reduces the number of iterations and execution time to analyze COVID-19 while comparing with the traditional k-means clustering algorithm. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Zubair, M.; Asif Iqbal, M.; Shil, A.; Haque, E.; Moshiul Hoque, M.; Sarker, I.

403676,Correction: Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Chinese Health Care Workers: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,2021,"Negative symptoms are core features of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders that are frequently observed across all phases of illness. By their nature, COVID-19 social isolation, physical distancing, and health precautions induce behavioural aspects of negative symptoms. However, it is unclear whether these prevention measures also lead to increases in experiential negative symptoms, whether such effects are equivalent across individual negative symptom domains, and if exacerbations occur equivalently across phases of illness. The current study compared negative symptom severity scores obtained during the pandemic to pre-pandemic assessments in two samples: (1) outpatients with chronic schizophrenia (SZ: n = 32) and matched healthy controls (CN: n = 31) and (2) individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR: n = 25) and matched CN (n = 30). Pre-pandemic ratings of negative symptoms were clinically elevated in SZ and CHR groups, which did not differ from each other in severity. In SZ, ratings obtained during the pandemic were significantly higher than pre-pandemic ratings for all 5 domains (alogia, blunted affect, anhedonia, avolition, and asociality) and item-level analyses indicated that exacerbations occurred on both experiential and behavioral symptoms of anhedonia, avolition, and asociality. In contrast, CHR only exhibited increases in anhedonia and avolition items during the pandemic compared to pre-ratings. Findings suggest that negative symptoms should be a critical treatment target during and after the pandemic in the schizophrenia spectrum given that they are worsening and critically related to risk for conversion, functional outcome, and recovery.","Strauss, Gregory P; Macdonald, Kelsey I; Ruiz, Ivan; Raugh, Ian M; Bartolomeo, Lisa A; James, Sydney H",Eur. arch. psychiatr. clin. neurosci,,560

This mainly affects the elderly and people with underlying diseases. People with obesity are more likely to experience unpleasant disease symptoms and increased mortality. The severe oxidative environment that occurs in obesity due to chronic inflammation permits viral activation of further inflammation leading to severe lung disease. Lifestyle affects the levels of inflammation and oxidative stress. It has been shown that a careful diet rich in antioxidants, regular exercise, and fasting regimens, each and/or together, can reduce the levels of inflammation and oxidative stress and strengthen the immune system as they lead to weight loss and activate cellular antioxidant mechanisms and reduce oxidative damage. Thus, a lifestyle change based on the three pillars: antioxidants, exercise, and fasting could act as a proactive preventative measure against the adverse effects of COVID-19 by maintaining redox balance and well-functioning immunity. Moreover, because of the observed diversity in the expression of COVID-19 inflammation, the role of genetics of innate immune molecules, surfactant protein A (SP-A)1 and SP-A2, and their differential impact on the local lung microenvironment and host defense is reviewed as genetics may play a major role in the diverse expression of the disease.","Tekos, Fotios; Skaperda, Zoi; Goutzourelas, Nikolaos; Phelps, David S.; Floros, Joanna; Kouretas, Demetrios",Antioxidants,,560

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterize the design and rapid implementation of a complex, multimodal, technology response to COVID-19 led by the Intermountain Healthcare's (Intermountain's) Care Transformation Information Systems (CTIS) organization to build pandemic surge capacity. METHODS: Intermountain has active community-spread cases of COVID-19 that are increasing. We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Pandemic Intervals Framework (the Framework) to characterize CTIS leadership's multimodal technology response to COVID-19 at Intermountain. We provide results on implementation feasibility and sustainability of health information technology (HIT) interventions as of June 30, 2020, characterize lessons learned and identify persistent barriers to sustained deployment. RESULTS: We characterize the CTIS organization's multimodal technology response to COVID-19 in five relevant areas of the Framework enabling (1) incident management, (2) surveillance, (3) laboratory testing, (4) community mitigation, and (5) medical care and countermeasures. We are seeing increased use of traditionally slow-to-adopt technologies that create additional surge capacity while sustaining patient safety and care quality. CTIS leadership recognized early that a multimodal technology intervention could enable additional surge capacity for health care delivery systems with a broad geographic and service scope. A statewide central tracking system to coordinate capacity planning and management response is needed. Order interoperability between health care systems remains a barrier to an integrated response. CONCLUSION: The rate of future pandemics is estimated to increase. The pandemic response of health care systems, like Intermountain, offers a blueprint for the leadership role that HIT organizations can play in mainstream care delivery, enabling a nimbler, virtual health care delivery system that is more responsive to current and future needs.","Knighton, Andrew J; Ranade-Kharkar, Pallavi; Brunisholz, Kimberly D; Wolfe, Douglas; Allen, Lauren; Belnap, Thomas W; Moores Todd, Tamara; Srivastava, Rajendu; Kapsandoy, Seraphine; Ize-Ludlow, Diego; Allen, Todd L",Appl Clin Inform,,560

It is unknown whether anticoagulation can prevent these complications and improve outcome. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to answer the question: What is the effect of (prophylactic and therapeutic dose) anticoagulation therapy in COVID-19 patients on cardiovascular and thromboembolic complications and clinical outcome? Relevant outcome measures were mortality (crucial), hospital admission, length of stay, thromboembolic complications (pulmonary embolism, stroke, transient ischaemic attack), need for mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury and use of renal replacement therapy. Medline and Embase databases were searched with relevant search terms until 17 July 2020. After systematic analysis, eight studies were included. Analysis was stratified for the start of anticoagulation before or during hospital admission. RESULTS: There was insufficient evidence that therapeutic anticoagulation could improve the outcome in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. None of the studies demonstrated improved mortality, except for one very small Italian study. Furthermore, none of the studies showed a positive effect of anticoagulation on other outcome measures in COVID-19, such as ICU admission, length of hospital stay, thromboembolic complications, need for mechanical ventilation, acute kidney failure or need for renal replacement therapy, except for two studies demonstrating an association between anticoagulation and a lower incidence of pulmonary embolism. However, the level of evidence of all studies varied from 'low' to 'very low', according to the GRADE methodology. CONCLUSION: Analysis of the literature showed that there was insufficient evidence to answer our objective on the effect of anticoagulation on outcome in COVID-19 patients, especially due to the low scientific quality of the described studies. Randomised controlled studies are needed to answer this question.","Tieleman, R G; Klok, F A; Belfroid, E; Hoogervorst-Schilp, J; Schalkers, I; Jansen, C W; Siebelink, H J",Neth Heart J,,560

METHODS: A total of 78 ISOA patients were recruited from April 6, 2020, to April 10, 2020, through a public call of University of Mons (Mons, Belgium). Patients benefited from nasopharyngeal swabs and fulfilled the patient-reported outcome questionnaire. Among them, 46 patients performed psychophysical olfactory evaluation using olfactory identification testing. Based on the duration of the ISOA, 2 groups of patients were compared: patients with olfactory dysfunction duration &#8804;12 days (group 1) and those with duration >12 days (group 2). RESULTS: In group 1, 42 patients (87.5%) had a positive viral load determined by RT-PCR and 6 patients (12.5%) were negative. In group 2, 7 patients (23%) had a positive viral load and 23 patients (77%) were negative. The psychophysical olfactory evaluation reported that anosmia and hyposmia occurred in 24 (52%) and 11 (24%) patients, respectively. Eleven patients were normosmic. The viral load was significantly higher in patients of group 1 compared with those of group 2. CONCLUSIONS: Coronavirus disease 2019 was detected in a high proportion of ISOA patients, especially over the first 12 days of olfactory dysfunction. Anosmia is an important symptom to consider in the detection of COVID-19 infection.","Lechien, Jerome R; Cabaraux, Pierre; Chiesa-Estomba, Carlos M; Khalife, Mohamad; Plzak, Jan; Hans, Stéphane; Martiny, Delphine; Calvo-Henriquez, Christian; Barillari, Maria R; Hopkins, Claire; Saussez, Sven",Ear Nose Throat J,,560

Here, we demonstrate altered levels of factor XII (FXII) and its activation products in two independent cohorts of critically ill COVID-19 patients in comparison to patients suffering from severe acute respiratory distress syndrome due to influenza virus (ARDS-influenza). Compatible with this data, we report rapid consumption of FXII in COVID-19, but not in ARDS-influenza, plasma. Interestingly, the kaolin clotting time was not prolonged in COVID-19 as compared to ARDS-influenza. Using confocal and electron microscopy, we show that increased FXII activation rate, in conjunction with elevated fibrinogen levels, triggers formation of fibrinolysis-resistant, compact clots with thin fibers and small pores in COVID-19. Accordingly, we observed clot lysis in 30% of COVID-19 patients and 84% of ARDS-influenza subjects. Analysis of lung tissue sections revealed wide-spread extra- and intra-vascular compact fibrin deposits in COVID-19. Together, our results indicate that elevated fibrinogen levels and increased FXII activation rate promote thrombosis and thrombolysis resistance via enhanced thrombus formation and stability in COVID-19.","Wygrecka, Malgorzata; Birnhuber, Anna; Seeliger, Benjamin; Michalick, Laura; Pak, Oleg; Schultz, Astrid-Solveig; Schramm, Fabian; Zacharias, Martin; Gorkiewicz, Gregor; David, Sascha; Welte, Tobias; Schmidt, Julius J.; Weissmann, Norbert; Schermuly, Ralph T; Barreto, Guillermo; Schäfer, Liliana; Markart, Philipp; Brack, Markus C.; Hippenstiel, Stefan; Kurth, Florian; Sander, Leif E; Witzenrath, Martin; Kuebler, Wolfgang M.; Kwapiszewska, Grazyna; Preissner, Klaus T",,,560

During sepsis, the finely tuned system of immunity, inflammation and anti-inflammation is disturbed in a variety of ways. Both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways are upregulated, activation of the coagulation cascade and complement and sepsis-induced lymphopenia occur. Due to the manifold interactions in this network, the use of IgM-enriched intravenous immunoglobulins seems to be a promising therapeutic approach. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of evidence-based data to answer the important questions of appropriate patient populations, optimal timing and dosage of intravenous immunoglobulins. With this review, we aim to provide an overview of the role of immunoglobulins, with emphasis on IgM-enriched formulations, in the therapy of adult patients with sepsis and septic shock.","Jarczak, Dominik; Kluge, Stefan; Nierhaus, Axel",Int. j. mol. sci.

Today, a myriad of blockchain and cryptocurrency systems, applications, and technologies are widely available to companies, end-users, and even malicious actors who want to exploit the computational resources of regular users through \textit{cryptojacking} malware. Especially with ready-to-use mining scripts easily provided by service providers (e.g., Coinhive) and untraceable cryptocurrencies (e.g., Monero), cryptojacking malware has become an indispensable tool for attackers. Indeed, the banking industry, major commercial websites, government and military servers (e.g., US Dept. of Defense), online video sharing platforms (e.g., Youtube), gaming platforms (e.g., Nintendo), critical infrastructure resources (e.g., routers), and even recently widely popular remote video conferencing/meeting programs (e.g., Zoom during the Covid-19 pandemic) have all been the victims of powerful cryptojacking malware campaigns. Nonetheless, existing detection methods such as browser extensions that protect users with blacklist methods or antivirus programs with different analysis methods can only provide a partial panacea to this emerging cryptojacking issue as the attackers can easily bypass them by using obfuscation techniques or changing their domains or scripts frequently. Therefore, many studies in the literature proposed cryptojacking malware detection methods using various dynamic/behavioral features.","Tekiner, Ege; Acar, Abbas; Uluagac, A.

It then examines how these inequalities in COVID-19 are related to existing inequalities in chronic diseases and the social determinants of health, arguing that we are experiencing a syndemic pandemic It then explores the potential consequences for health inequalities of the lockdown measures implemented internationally as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the likely unequal impacts of the economic crisis.

The rapid review consisted of two elements, the first was a review of guidance published by national and international agencies relating to measures to support those in isolation (due to case status) or quarantine (due to close contact status) during the Covid-19 pandemic. Five categories of support measures were identified in the international guidance, they were: Psychological, addiction and safety supports, Essential supplies, Financial aid, Information provision and Enforcement. The second element was a rapid literature review of the effectiveness of measures used to support individuals in isolation or quarantine during any pandemic or epidemic setting, due to respiratory pathogens. A systematic search of published peer-reviewed articles and nonpeer-reviewed pre-prints was undertaken from 1 January 2000 to 26 January 2021. Two Australian publications met the inclusion criteria, both based on data from a survey undertaken during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The first reported that 55% of households were fully compliant with quarantine recommendations, and that there was increased compliance reported in households that understood what they were meant to do compared with those who reported that they did not (odds ratio [OR]: 2.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.35-3.80). The second reported that access to paid sick and or carer's leave did not predict compliance with quarantine recommendations (OR: 2.07, 95% CI: 0.82-5.23). Neither reported on reduction in transmission.","Cardwell, Karen; O039,; Neill, Sinéad M; Tyner, Barrie; Broderick, Natasha; Brien, Kirsty; Smith, Susan M; Harrington, Patricia; Ryan, Mairin; Neill, Michelle",Rev Med Virol,,560

437428,Assessing Attitudes Toward COVID-19 Prevention: Defining Two Attitudes Crucial for Understanding Systemic and Social Variables Associated with Disparities,2021,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted radiology departments across the country. The pandemic has also disrupted resident education, both due to departmental social distancing efforts and reduced imaging volumes. The purpose of this study was to assess the differential impact the pandemic had on radiology resident imaging volumes by training year and imaging modality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All signed radiology resident reports were curated during defined prepandemic and intrapandemic time periods. Imaging case volumes were analyzed on a mean per resident basis to quantify absolute and percent change by training level. Change in total volume by imaging modality was also assessed. The number of resident workdays assigned outside the normal reading room was also calculated. RESULTS: Overall percent decline in resident imaging interpretation volume from the prepandemic to intrapandemic time period was 62.8%. R1s and R2s had the greatest decline at 87.3% and 64.3%, respectively. Mammography, MRI and nuclear medicine had the greatest decline in resident interpretation volume at 92.0%, 73.2%, and 73.0%, respectively. During the intrapandemic time period, a total of 478 resident days (mean of 14.5 days per resident) were reassigned outside of the radiology reading room. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a marked decrease in radiology resident imaging interpretation volume and has had a tremendous impact on resident education. The decrease in case interpretation, as well as in-person teaching has profound implications for resident education. Knowledge of this differential decrease by training level will help residency programs plan for the future.","Poyiadji, Neo; Klochko, Chad; LaForce, Jeff; Brown, Manuel L; Griffith, Brent",Acad. radiol,,560

The present study was conducted to explore the feasibility of convalescent plasma treatment in 10 kidney transplant recipients with severe COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The prospective observational cohort study was conducted at the Institute of Kidney Disease and Research Centre, Ahmedabad, India. All patients were admitted to the intensive care unit and received antiviral therapy, glucocorticoids, and other supportive care. Two doses of 200 mL each of convalescent plasma with neutralization activity of >1:640 were transfused into patients 24 hours apart following the World Health Organization blood transfusion protocol. The endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 1 day and 7 days after convalescent plasma transfusion. RESULTS: The patients showed resolution of clinical symptoms, and there was a significant decrease in inflammatory markers (P < .05) within 7 days of convalescent plasma transfusion. Of the 10 patients, 9 patients had full recovery and 1 patient died. CONCLUSIONS: Convalescent plasma therapy is highly safe and clinically feasible and reduces mortality in kidney transplant recipients with severe COVID-19.

443833,Social Media Use for Health Purposes: Systematic Review,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to examine the incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in women diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, also known as COVID-19). STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study of all women who delivered at MedStar Washington Hospital Center in Washington, DC from April 8, 2020 to July 31, 2020. Starting April 8, 2020, universal testing for COVID-19 infection was initiated for all women admitted to labor and delivery. Women who declined universal testing were excluded. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were diagnosed based on American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Task Force definitions.1 Maternal demographics, clinical characteristics, and labor and delivery outcomes were examined. Neonatal outcomes were also collected. Laboratory values from admission were evaluated. Our primary outcome was the incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy among women who tested positive for COVID-19. The incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was compared between women who tested positive for COVID-19 and women who tested negative. RESULTS: Of the 1,008 women included in the analysis, 73 (7.2%) women tested positive for COVID-19, of which 12 (16.4%) were symptomatic at the time of admission. The incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was 34.2% among women who tested positive for COVID-19 and 22.9% women who tested negative for COVID-19 (p = 0.03). After adjusting for race, antenatal aspirin use, chronic hypertension, and body mass index >30, the risk of developing any hypertensive disorder of pregnancy was not statistically significant (odds ratio: 1.58 [0.91-2.76]). CONCLUSION: After adjusting for potential confounders, the risk of developing a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy in women who tested positive for COVID-19 compared with women who tested negative for COVID-19 was not significantly different. KEY POINTS: · There is an increased incidence of hypertensive disorders in women who test positive for COVID-19.. · Characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 are similar to those with hypertensive disorders.. · Liver function tests were similar between pregnant women with COVID-19 and women without COVID-19..","Chornock, Rebecca; Iqbal, Sara N; Wang, Tiffany; Kodama, Samantha; Kawakita, Tetsuya; Fries, Melissa",Am. j. perinatol,,560

The first protocol does not rely on synchronised clocks. The second protocol does not require a handshake between two devices, at the expense of relying on real-time communication with a central server. We stress that digital contact tracing is a form of technological solutionism that should be used with care, especially given the inherent mass surveillance nature of such systems.","Hoepman, Jaap-Henk",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03241v1.pdf,560

In this work, we studied the electrophysiologic maturation of PRPs throughout the differentiation process. Methods: Human embryonic stem cells were differentiated into PRPs and whole-cell recordings were performed for electrophysiologic characterization at days 0, 30, 60, and 90 along with quantitative PCR analysis to characterize the expression level of various ion channels, which shape the electrophysiologic response. Finally, to characterize the electrically induced calcium currents, we employed calcium imaging (rhod4) to visualize intracellular calcium dynamics in response to electrical activation. Results: Our results revealed an early and steady presence (approximately 100% of responsive cells) of the delayed potassium rectifier current. In contrast, the percentage of cells exhibiting voltage-gated sodium currents increased with maturation (from 0% to almost 90% of responsive cells at 90 days). Moreover, calcium imaging revealed the presence of voltage-gated calcium currents, which play a major role in vision formation. These results were further supported by quantitative PCR analysis, which revealed a significant and continuous (3- to 50-fold) increase in the expression of various voltage-gated channels concomitantly with the increase in the expression of the photoreceptor marker CRX. Conclusions: These results can shed light on the electrophysiologic maturation of neurons in general and PRP in particular and can form the basis for devising and optimizing cell replacement-based vision restoration strategies.","Schick, Revital; Farah, Nairouz; Markus, Amos; Korngreen, Alon; Mandel, Yossi",Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,,560

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 NP antibody in serum or plasma samples was captured by protein G-coated microtiter plate and detected using the crude cell lysates expressing Nanoluc luciferase (Nluc) enzyme fused with SARS-CoV-2 NP. After the addition of furimazine substrate, the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 NP IgG antibody were quantitatively measured as luciferase light units. As expected, SARS-CoV-2 NP showed cross-reactivity with the monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV NP, but not MERS-CoV NP-specific monoclonal antibodies or the monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV Spike protein. LISA for detecting murine monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV NP showed a low limit of detection of 0.4 pg/µl and linear detection range from 0.4 pg/µl to 75 pg/µl. Furthermore, LISA had a sensitivity of 71 % when testing COVID-19 patients at the second week post onset and a specificity of 100 % when testing healthy blood donors.","Liang, Yuanhao; Yan, Huanchang; Huang, Liping; Zhao, Jianhui; Wang, Haiying; Kang, Min; Wan, Zhengwei; Shui, Jingwei; Tang, Shixing",J Virol Methods,,560

AIM: The current study aimed to evaluate the association of substance dependence (alcohol and tobacco) with the outcome (i.e., time to have two consecutive negative test reports) of the COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: The mean age of the study participants (n = 95) was 37.2 yrs (SD-13.2). More than half of the participants were males. About one-fourth (N = 25; 26.3 %) were consuming various substances in a dependent pattern. Alcohol dependence was present in 21 participants (22.1 %), and Tobacco dependence was present in 10.5 % of participants. Even after using gender, age, and physical illness as covariates, patients with any kind of substance dependence had a significantly lower chance of having a negative report on RT-PCR on 14th day, 18th 23rd day. CONCLUSION: Persons with substance dependence takes a longer time to test negative on RT-PCR, once diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. Mental health professionals involved in the care of patients with COVID-19 should accordingly prepare these patients for a possible longer hospital stay to reduce the distress associated with prolongation of hospital stay.","Mehra, Aseem; Suri, Vikas; Sahoo, Swapnajeet; Malhotra, Pankaj; Yaddanapudi, Lakshmi Narayana; Puri, G D; Bhalla, Ashish; Grover, Sandeep",Asian J Psychiatr,,560

This paper investigates teachers' perceptions regarding their digital skills for performing their teaching and professional responsibilities during the pandemic. More than eight hundred teachers participated in a survey regarding the use of digital technologies in their teaching and their professional responsibilities. Indicative digital tools that can be used by digital competent teachers are also presented to cover all areas of the teachers' professional activities. Their answers revealed that they mostly used digital tools for finding, evaluating, and developing educational resources as well for teaching. They also used digital tools for self-study, students' assessment, as well as interacting and communicating with students. However, they hardly used digital tools for other teaching activities such as feedback and final evaluation of the students, or revising the educational resources. Finally, they could not deal with long-term planning, management, and development of either their school or education in general. Although it is important for teachers to effectively respond to their daily emergent teaching responsibilities, consideration should also be given to the long-term planning and development of the digital school and digital education in general.","Perifanou, M.; Economides, A.

The aim of our study was to evaluate hydroxychloroquine concentrations in the lung epithelial lining fluid (ELF) in patients infected with COVID-19. This study is a retrospective, observational, multicenter, pharmacokinetics study of hydroxychloroquine in critically ill patients. No additional interventions or additional samples compared to standard care of these patients were conducted in our teaching hospital. We included all intubated COVID-19 patients treated with crushed hydroxychloroquine tablets, regardless of the dosage administered by the nasogastric tube. Blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples (n= 28) were collected from 22 COVID-19 patients and the total hydroxychloroquine concentrations in epithelial lining fluid were estimated. Median hydroxychloroquine plasma concentrations were of 0.09 [0.06; 0.14] mg/l and 0.07 [0.05; 0.08] mg/l for 400 mg x 1/day and 200 mg x 3/day, respectively. Median hydroxychloroquine ELF concentrations were of 3.74 [1.10; 7.26] mg/l and 1.81 [1.20; 7.25] for 400 mg x 1/day and 200 mg x 3/day, respectively. The median ratio of ELF/plasma concentrations was of 40.0 [7.3; 162.7] and 21.2 [18.4; 109.5] for 400 mg x 1/day and 200 mg x 3/day, respectively. Exposure in the ELF is likely to be underestimated due to the concentrations of plasma hydroxychloroquine. In clinical practice, low plasma concentrations should not induce an increase in drug dosage because the lung exposure may already be high.","Ruiz, S; Concordet, D; Lanot, T; Georges, B; Goudy, P; Baklouti, S; Mane, C; Losha, E; Vinour, H; Rousset, D; Lavit, M; Minville, V; Conil, J-M; Gandia, P",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,560

Several programs across the country have been running efficiently to increase the cataract surgical rates and decrease blindness due to cataract. The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to a complete halt of these programs and thus accumulating all the elective cataract procedures. At present with the better understanding of the safety precautions among the health care workers and general population the Government of India (GoI) has given clearance for functioning of eye care facilities. In order to facilitate smooth functioning of every clinic, in this paper, we prepared preferred practice pattern based on consensus discussions between leading ophthalmologists in India including representatives from major governmental and private institutions as well as the All India Ophthalmological Society leadership. These guidelines will be applicable to all practice settings including tertiary institutions, corporate and group practices and individual eye clinics. The guidelines include triage, use of personal protective equipment, precautions to be taken in the OPD and operating room as well for elective cataract screening and surgery. These guidelines have been prepared based on current situation but are expected to evolve over a period of time based on the ongoing pandemic and guidelines from GoI.","Reddy, Jagadesh C; Vaddavalli, Pravin K; Sharma, Namrata; Sachdev, Mahipal S; Rajashekar, Y L; Sinha, Rajesh; Agarwal, Amar; Porwal, Amit; Chakrabarti, Arup; Nayak, Barun Kumar; Jain, Bhudhendra Kumar; Chandrasekhar, D; Ramamurthy, Chitra; Mehta, Cyres Keiki; Bhattacharya, Debasish; Luthra, Gaurav; Aravind, Haripriya; Bhattacharjee, Harsha; Mehta, Himanshu Rasiklal; Titiyal, J S; Ram, Jagat; Bhalla, Jatinder Singh; Dasari, Keerthi Kumar; Mehta, Keiki R; Kudlu, Krishna Prasad; Prasad, R Krishna; Murugesan, Kumaran; Singh, Mandeep Jot; Rajan, Mohan; Rohit, Om Parkash; Gogate, Parikshit; Biswas, Partha; Padmanabhan, Prema; Parekh, Ragini Hasmukuray; Khanna, Rohit; Honavar, Santosh G; Murthy, Somasheila I; Goel, Sonu; Ganesh, Sri; Arora, Vinod Kumar",Indian J Ophthalmol,,560

These challenges firstly fall on the administration of a higher education institution. To assist in solving the challenges of the pandemic for the administration of a higher education institution, the paper presents several models for the organization of the processes of distance learning. These models are as follows: a conceptual model of distance learning, a model of strategic planning of distance learning, a model of the assessment before the start of distance learning, a model of the preparation for distance learning, and a model of the process of distance learning and remote work. Student profile, lecturer profile, organizational environment, assessment, and planning of the infrastructure of information and communication technology (ICT), assessment and planning of the virtual learning environment, and assessment of distance learning competencies of participants of the study process are also considered. The developed models are based on five main processes of instructional design, i.e., analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. The models provide guidelines for the administration of higher education institutions on the preparation and delivery of distance learning during the pandemic. The models were validated by 10 experts from different higher education institutions. The feasibility of the data collection instrument was determined by Cronbach's alpha coefficient that is above 0.9.","Jusas, V.; Butkiene, R.; Venckauskas, A.; Burbaite, R.; Gudoniene, D.; Grigaliunas, S.; Andone, D.",Sustainability,,560
471559,Sociodemographic Differences and Factors Affecting Patient Portal Utilization,2020,"While vaccination campaigns are ongoing worldwide, there is still a tremendous medical need for efficient antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among several drug candidates, chloroquine (CQN) and hydroxychloroquine (H-CQN) were tested intensively, and any contentious therapeutic effect of both has been discussed controversially in the light of severe side effects and missing efficacy. Originally, H-CQN descended from the natural substance quinine, a medicinal product used since the Middle Ages, which actually is regulatory approved for various indications. We hypothesized that quinine also exerts anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. In Vero cells, quinine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection more effectively than CQN, and H-CQN and was less toxic. In human Caco-2 colon epithelial cells as well as the lung cell line A549 stably expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2, quinine also showed antiviral activity. In consistence with Vero cells, quinine was less toxic in A549 as compared to CQN and H-CQN. Finally, we confirmed our findings in Calu-3 lung cells, expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 endogenously. In Calu-3, infections with high titers of SARS-CoV-2 were completely blocked by quinine, CQN, and H-CQN in concentrations above 50 microM. The estimated IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;s were ~25 microM in Calu-3, while overall, the inhibitors exhibit IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values between ~3.7 to ~50 microM, dependent on the cell line and multiplicity of infection (MOI). Conclusively, our data indicate that quinine could have the potential of a treatment option for SARS-CoV-2, as the toxicological and pharmacological profile seems more favorable when compared to its progeny drugs H-CQN or CQN.","Grose, M.; Ruetalo, N.; Layer, M.; Hu, D.; Businger, R.; Rheber, S.; Setz, C.; Rauch, P.; Auth, J.; Froba, M.; Brysch, E.; Schindler, M.; Schubert, U.",Viruses,,560
473461,Clinical high risk for psychosis paradigm for CAP: do not throw the baby out with the bathwater,2020,"BACKGROUND: Holding conspiracy beliefs regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has been associated with reductions in both actions to prevent the spread of the infection (eg, mask wearing) and intentions to accept a vaccine when one becomes available. Patterns of media use have also been associated with acceptance of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs. Here we ask whether the type of media on which a person relies increased, decreased, or had no additional effect on that person's COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs over a 4-month period. OBJECTIVE: We used panel data to explore whether use of conservative and social media in the United States, which were previously found to be positively related to holding conspiracy beliefs about the origins and prevention of COVID-19, were associated with a net increase in the strength of those beliefs from March to July of 2020. We also asked whether mainstream news sources, which were previously found to be negatively related to belief in pandemic-related conspiracies, were associated with a net decrease in the strength of such beliefs over the study period. Additionally, we asked whether subsequent changes in pandemic conspiracy beliefs related to the use of media were also related to subsequent mask wearing and vaccination intentions. METHODS: A survey that we conducted with a national US probability sample in March of 2020 and again in July with the same 840 respondents assessed belief in pandemic-related conspiracies, use of various types of media information sources, actions taken to prevent the spread of the disease and intentions to vaccinate, and various demographic characteristics. Change across the two waves was analyzed using path analytic techniques. RESULTS: We found that conservative media use predicted an increase in conspiracy beliefs (ß=.17, 99% CI .10-.25) and that reliance on mainstream print predicted a decrease in their belief (ß=-.08, 99% CI -.14 to -.02). Although many social media platforms reported downgrading or removing false or misleading content, ongoing use of such platforms by respondents predicted growth in conspiracy beliefs as well (ß=.072, 99% CI .018-.123). Importantly, conspiracy belief changes related to media use between the two waves of the study were associated with the uptake of mask wearing and changes in vaccination intentions in July. Unlike other media, use of mainstream broadcast television predicted greater mask wearing (ß=.17, 99% CI .09-.26) and vaccination intention (ß=.08, 95% CI .02-.14), independent of conspiracy beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: The findings point to the need for greater efforts on the part of commentators, reporters, and guests on conservative media to report verifiable information about the pandemic. The results also suggest that social media platforms need to be more aggressive in downgrading, blocking, and counteracting claims about COVID-19 vaccines, claims about mask wearing, and conspiracy beliefs that have been judged problematic by public health authorities.","Romer, Daniel; Jamieson, Kathleen Hall",J Med Internet Res,,560
473654,"Palestinian and Israeli health professionals, let us work together!",2020,"BACKGROUND: The spectrum of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is broad and thus early appropriate risk stratification can be helpful. Our objectives were to define the frequency of myocardial injury using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) and to understand how to use its prognostic abilities. METHODS: Retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 presenting to an Emergency Department (ED) in Italy in 2020. Hs-cTnI was sampled based on clinical judgment. Myocardial injury was defined as values above the sex-specific 99th percentile upper reference limits (URLs). Most data is from the initial hospital value. RESULTS: 426 unique patients were included. Hs-cTnI was measured in 313 (73.5%) patients; 85 (27.2%) had myocardial injury at baseline. Patients with myocardial injury had higher mortality during hospitalization (hazard ratio = 9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.55-17.79], p < 0.0001). Multivariable analysis including clinical and laboratory variables demonstrated an AUC of 0.942 with modest additional value of hs-cTnI. Myocardial injury was associated with mortality in patients with low APACHE II scores (<13) [OR (95% CI): 4.15 (1.40, 14.22), p = 0.014] but not in those with scores > 13 [OR (95% CI): 0.48 (0.08, 2.65), p = 0.40]. Initial hs-cTnI < 5 ng/L identified 33% of patients that were at low risk with 97.8% sensitivity (95% CI 88.7, 99.6) and 99.2% negative predictive value. Type 1 myocardial infarction (MI) and type 2 MI were infrequent. CONCLUSIONS: hs-cTnI at baseline is a significant predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients.

These variety of fluent but wrong outputs are particularly problematic, as it will not be possible for users to tell they are being presented incorrect content. To detect these errors, we propose a task to predict whether each token in the output sequence is hallucinated (not contained in the input) and collect new manually annotated evaluation sets for this task. We also introduce a method for learning to detect hallucinations using pretrained language models fine tuned on synthetic data that includes automatically inserted hallucinations Experiments on machine translation (MT) and abstractive summarization demonstrate that our proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines on all benchmark datasets. We further demonstrate how to use the token-level hallucination labels to define a fine-grained loss over the target sequence in low-resource MT and achieve significant improvements over strong baseline methods. We also apply our method to word-level quality estimation for MT and show its effectiveness in both supervised and unsupervised settings.

475529,Factors Influencing Telehealth Implementation and Use in Frontier Critical Access Hospitals: Qualitative Study,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The pandemic coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has pushed the global healthcare system to a crisis and amounted to a huge economic burden. Different drugs for prophylaxis against COVID-19 including chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been tried. This study was performed to systematically review the role of CQ and HCQ in preventing the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies that evaluated the prophylactic role of CQ or HCQ on SARS-CoV-2 (pre-clinical studies) or COVID-19 (clinical studies) until 30 March 2020. The available literature was critically appraised. RESULTS: A total of 45 articles were screened and 5 (3 in vitro pre-clinical studies and 2 clinical opinions) were included. The pre-clinical studies showed the prophylactic effects of CQ and HCQ against SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, the clinical opinions advocated the prophylactic use of CQ and HCQ against COVID-19. However, no original clinical studies on the prophylactic role of CQ or HCQ on COVID-19 were available. CONCLUSION: Although pre-clinical results are promising, to date there is a dearth of evidence to support the efficacy of CQ or HCQ in preventing COVID-19. Considering potential safety issues and the likelihood of imparting a false sense of security, prophylaxis with CQ or HCQ against COVID-19 needs to be thoroughly evaluated in observational studies or high-quality randomized controlled studies.","Shah, Sanket; Das, Saibal; Jain, Avinash; Misra, Durga Prasanna; Negi, Vir Singh",Int J Rheum Dis,,560

This systematic review and meta-analysis was initiated to clarify the prevalence of respiratory viruses in children with bronchiolitis in the pre-COVID-19 pandemic era. METHODS: We performed an electronic search through Pubmed and Global Index Medicus databases. We included observational studies reporting the detection rate of common respiratory viruses in children with bronchiolitis using molecular assays. Data was extracted and the quality of the included articles was assessed. We conducted sensitivity, subgroups, publication bias, and heterogeneity analyses using a random effect model. RESULTS: The final meta-analysis included 51 studies. Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) was largely the most commonly detected virus 59.2%; 95% CI [54.7; 63.6]). The second predominant virus was Rhinovirus (RV) 19.3%; 95% CI [16.7; 22.0]) followed by Human bocavirus (HBoV) 8.2%; 95% CI [5.7; 11.2]). Other reported viruses included Human Adenovirus (HAdV) 6.1%; 95% CI [4.4; 8.0]), Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) 5.4%; 95% CI [4.4; 6.4]), Human Parainfluenzavirus (HPIV) 5.4%; 95% CI [3.8; 7.3]), Influenza 3.2%; 95% CI [2.2; 4.3], Human Coronavirus (HCoV) 2.9%; 95% CI [2.0; 4.0]), and Enterovirus (EV) 2.9%; 95% CI [1.6; 4.5]). HRSV was the predominant virus involved in multiple detection and most codetections were HRSV + RV 7.1%, 95% CI [4.6; 9.9]) and HRSV + HBoV 4.5%, 95% CI [2.4; 7.3]). CONCLUSIONS: The present study has shown that HRSV is the main cause of bronchiolitis in children, we also have Rhinovirus, and Bocavirus which also play a significant role.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study on observational data. In Germany, summer school holidays are coordinated between states and spread out over 13 weeks. Employing a dynamic model with district fixed effects, we analyze the association between these holidays and weekly incidence rates across 401 German districts. RESULTS: We find effects of the holiday period of around 45% of the average district incidence rates in Germany during their respective final week of holidays and the 2 weeks after holidays end. Western states tend to experience stronger effects than Eastern states. We also find statistically significant interaction effects of school holidays with per capita taxable income and the share of foreign residents in a district's population. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that changed behavior during the holiday season accelerated the pandemic and made it considerably more difficult for public health authorities to contain the spread of the virus by means of contact tracing.

481612,Utility of Substandard Face Mask Options for Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been linked to a higher risk of mortality compared to influenza, which is mainly due to severe secondary diseases, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In turn, ARDS is characterized by an acute inflammation and an excessive activity of the coagulation cascade, rising the vulnerability for venous thromboembolic events. In order to investigate the relation of inflammation and the influence of coagulation factors on their release, human peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMCs) were treated with autologous serum, heparinized plasma and different doses of fibrin. Thereafter, the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the secretome of PBMCs was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our analyses revealed autologous serum to significantly increase the secretion of cytokines and chemokines after 24 h of incubation time. Furthermore, the addition of fibrin markedly increased the secretion of cytokines and chemokines by PBMCs in a dose-dependent manner. Consequently, in accordance with previous studies, our study outlines that anti-coagulation may constitute a promising tool for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, reducing both, the cytokine storm, as well as the risk for thrombotic complications.","Paar, Vera; Wernly, Bernhard; Zhou, Zhichao; Motloch, Lukas J; Hoppe, Uta C; Egle, Alexander; Lichtenauer, Michael",J. thromb. thrombolysis,,560

The results obtained, together with conceptual tools coming from the global taxonomy of fundamental cognitive mechanisms emerging in AMI and with suitable contextual information from Colombian public health and mainstream social media, allowed us to stating specific preventive guidelines for a better restructuring of initial safe and stable life conditions in Colombia, and in an extended manner in similar Latin American Countries. More specifically, we describe three major guidelines: 1) regular creative visualization and effective planning, 2) the continuous use of constructive linguistic frameworks, and 3) frequent and moderate use of kinesthetic routines. They should be understood as effective tools from a cognitive and behavioural perspective, rather than from a biological one.

494278,Citizen Responses to Government Restrictions in Switzerland During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-Sectional Survey,2020,Coronavirus is a novel human pathogen causing fulminant respiratory syndrome (COVID-19). Developing an effective and reliable vaccine was emergently pursued to control the dramatic spread of the global pandemic. The standard stages for vaccine development were unprecedentedly accelerated over a few months. We report a case of new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) after receiving the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. We attribute the occurrence of NORSE to the vaccine due to the temporal relationship and the lack of risk factors for epilepsy in the patient. This report adds to the literature a possible rare side effect of a COVID-19 vaccine and contributes to the extremely limited literature on potential neurological side effects of viral vector vaccines. Healthcare providers should be aware of the possibility of post-vaccination epilepsy. The patient had recurrent seizures that were refractory to conventional antiepileptic drug therapy with a dramatic response to immunotherapy with pulse steroids and plasmapheresis. This likely reflects an underlying autoimmune mechanism in the genesis of post-vaccination generalized seizures without fever. Further research is needed to probe and study the exact mechanism at a more molecular level.,"Aladdin, Yasser; Shirah, Bader",J Neuroimmunol,,560

Because polyphenol catechins could confer antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antimicrobial activities, we assessed the therapeutic effects of catechins against SARS-CoV replication in Vero E6 cells, the preventive effect of catechins on CD25/CD69/CD94/CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes-mediated adaptive immunity, and the protective effect on lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in mice. We found that catechins containing 32.8% epigallocatechin gallate, 15.2% epicatechin gallate, 13.2 epicatechin, 10.8% epigallocatechin, 10.4% gallocatechin, and 4.4% catechin directly inhibited SARS-CoV replication at sub-micromolecular concentrations. Four-week catechins ingestion increased CD8+ T cell percentage, upregulated CD69+/CD25+/CD94-NKG2A/CD8+ T lymphocytes-mediated adaptive immunity, and increased type I cytokines release responding to ovalbumin/alum. Catechins significantly reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine storm and oxidative stress and ALI by inhibiting PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling to upregulate Beclin-1/Atg5-Atg12/LC3-II-mediated autophagy mechanism. Pretreatment of autophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine reversed the inhibiting effects of catechins on the cytokines and oxidative stress levels and ALI. In conclusion, our data indicated that catechins directly inhibited SARS-CoV replication, potentiated the CD25/CD69/CD94/CD8+ T lymphocytes-mediated adaptive immunity and attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI and cytokine storm by PI3K/AKT/mTOR-signaling-mediated autophagy, which may be applied to prevent and/or treat SARS-CoV infection.","Yang, Chih-Ching Wu Chang-Jer Chien Chen-Yen Chien Chiang-Ting",Antioxidants,,560

CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year old woman and a 54-year old man with severe COVID-19 underwent corticosteroid therapy for immune-related lung injuries. The first case presented with a bilateral visual loss and complete ophthalmoplegia of the right eye. The second case presented with vision loss, proptosis, orbital inflammation, and complete ophthalmoplegia on the left side. Histopathologic, nasal endoscopic examinations, and radiologic findings confirmed mucormycosis in both patients. The patients denied orbital exenteration and were managed with systemic amphotericin B and daily endoscopic sinus debridement and irrigation with diluted amphotericin B. Because of the intracranial space involvement, the first case died. The second case was successfully managed surgically and medically. CONCLUSION: Rhino-orbital/cerebral mucormycosis may be developed in COVID-19 patients under treatment with corticosteroid, and requires prompt diagnosis and management.","Veisi, Amirreza; Bagheri, Abbas; Eshaghi, Mohammad; Rikhtehgar, Mohamad Hasan; Rezaei Kanavi, Mozhgan; Farjad, Reza",Eur J Ophthalmol,,560

There is a relationship between the severity of COVID-19 and the severity and frequency of neurological manifestations. Severe neurological disorders are mostly seen in severe cases of COVID-19 and include acute cerebrovascular accidents (aCVA), acute necrotizing encephalopathy, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Factors potentially complicating the course of COVID-19 and increasing the development of neurological complications include arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic cardiac and respiratory system diseases. Questions of the possible effects of human coronaviruses on the course of chronic progressive neurological diseases are addressed using multiple sclerosis (MS) as an example.

506917,Impact of Big Data Analytics on People's Health: Overview of Systematic Reviews and Recommendations for Future Studies,2021,"BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus responsible for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has infected more than 8 million people worldwide and placed massive strains on healthcare systems around the world. Although classically causing cough, fever, and shortness of breath, increasing evidence suggests that manifestations of COVID-19 can be more subtle or masquerade as other clinical entities. CASE REPORT A 48-year-old man with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to the Emergency Department with acute-onset pleuritic chest pain that had developed 1 day earlier and was found to be hypoxemic, requiring supplemental oxygen. He was admitted under the internal medicine service and underwent an extensive workup for his chest pain and hypoxemia, including a negative computed tomography scan with pulmonary embolism protocol, negative nuclear medicine ventilation/perfusion scan, normal electrocardiogram, and normal echocardiography. In the end, he was diagnosed with viral pleuritis as the diagnosis of exclusion. Our patient subsequently developed a fever and shortness of breath and his nasopharyngeal swab performed on admission to hospital returned positive for COVID-19. The patient's pleuritic pain and oxygen requirements improved with supportive management over the next several days. CONCLUSIONS I report a patient who experienced pleuritic chest pain from viral pleurisy that was the initial manifestation of COVID-19 which, to the best of my knowledge, has not yet been reported in the literature. This case report further emphasizes that COVID-19 may present with atypical symptoms. It is crucial to be aware of these atypical presentations of COVID-19 so that patients are appropriately identified, isolated, and treated, while protecting health care workers from exposure.","Oleynick, Christopher",Am J Case Rep,,560

However, none of these strategies are robust to implementation errors: mistiming the start of the intervention by even a single week can be enormously costly, for realistic epidemic parameters. Sustained control measures, though less efficient than optimal and near-optimal time-limited interventions, can be used in combination with time-limited strategies to mitigate the catastrophic risks of mistiming.","Morris, Dylan H.; Rossine, Fernando W.; Plotkin, Joshua B.; Levin, Simon A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02209v2.pdf,560

In our multicenter study, 543 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were classified as non-severe group and severe group, and then were compared respectively for all-cause mortality and length of hospital stay between those who received corticosteroids and not. By searching in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and CNKI, we identified 13 retrospective studies and 6 random control trials eligible for criteria of inclusion, and conducted comprehensive meta-analyses assessing the impacts of corticosteroids on mortality, length of stay, duration of RNA clearance and duration of fever. Our multicenter study demonstrated that low-dose corticosteroids can reduce mortality in the multivariable Cox regression analysis for severe patients (p = .03), while presented no influence in univariable analysis for non-severe patients (p = .14). From multivariable analyses, patients with corticosteroids in non-severe group had longer duration of hospitalization (p = .003), but did not in severe group (p = .18). Moreover, for severe patients, corticosteroids can evidently shorten duration of fever. The same results were summarized in the meta-analyses supplemented with the result that corticosteroids delayed viral clearing in non-severe patients. Corticosteroids should be considered based on patient's condition. For patients with non-severe COVID-19, corticosteroid was not recommended as a routine therapeutic initiative as that presented prolonged duration of hospitalization and delayed viral clearing, as well as no positive impact on prognosis. While low-dose corticosteroids may benefit patients with severe COVID-19 for it can manifestly lower risk of death and improve the clinical status to some extent.","Zhan, Yuan; Shang, Jin; Gu, Yiya; Huang, Qian; Xie, Jungang",J. med. virol,,560

Methods Our national e-cohort (n=464531) study used anonymised linked data for pupils, staff and associated households linked via educational settings in Wales. We estimated the odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection for staff and pupils over the period August-December 2020, dependent on measures of recent exposure to known cases linked to their educational settings. Results The total number of cases in a school was not associated with a subsequent increase in the odds of testing positive (staff OR per case: 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.00;pupil OR per case: 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02). Among pupils, the number of recent cases within the same year group was significantly associated with subsequent increased odds of testing positive (OR per case: 1.12, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.15).

METHOD: In this retrospective study, a total of 323 patients severe acute respiratory syndrome due to PCR-documented COVID-19 infection admitted in our unit were included. Patients were categorized into two groups as those who did or did not receive high dose intravenous vitamin C. we examined the effect of high dose intravenous vitamin C administered in addition to other commonly used agents on prognosis in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: As compared to patients who did not receive vitamin C, those in the VC group were not significantly different in terms of the length of hospital stay (p=0.05), re-admission rate (p=0.943), admission to intensive care, need for advanced oxygen support (p=0.488), need for advanced medical treatment (p<0.001), and mortality (p=0.52). CONCLUSION: The limited evidence based on small samples precludes definitive conclusions regarding the potential efficacy of high dose vitamin C in these patients, indicating the need for further assessment within the context of clinical research.","Suna, Kavurgaci; Melahat, Uzel Sener; Murat, Yildiz; Figen, Öztürk Ergür; Ayperi, Öztürk",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),,560
515812,Likely Exacerbation of Psychological Disorders from Covid-19 Response,2021,"BACKGROUND: The BNT162b2 mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) COVID-19 vaccines have shown high efficacy against disease in phase 3 clinical trials and are now being used in national vaccination programmes in the UK and several other countries. Studying the real-world effects of these vaccines is an urgent requirement. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between the mass roll-out of the first doses of these COVID-19 vaccines and hospital admissions for COVID-19. METHODS: We did a prospective cohort study using the Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19-EAVE II-database comprising linked vaccination, primary care, real-time reverse transcription-PCR testing, and hospital admission patient records for 5·4 million people in Scotland (about 99% of the population) registered at 940 general practices. Individuals who had previously tested positive were excluded from the analysis. A time-dependent Cox model and Poisson regression models with inverse propensity weights were fitted to estimate effectiveness against COVID-19 hospital admission (defined as 1-adjusted rate ratio) following the first dose of vaccine. FINDINGS: Between Dec 8, 2020, and Feb 22, 2021, a total of 1 331 993 people were vaccinated over the study period. The mean age of those vaccinated was 65·0 years (SD 16·2). The first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was associated with a vaccine effect of 91% (95% CI 85-94) for reduced COVID-19 hospital admission at 28-34 days post-vaccination. Vaccine effect at the same time interval for the ChAdOx1 vaccine was 88% (95% CI 75-94). Results of combined vaccine effects against hospital admission due to COVID-19 were similar when restricting the analysis to those aged 80 years and older (83%, 95% CI 72-89 at 28-34 days post-vaccination). INTERPRETATION: Mass roll-out of the first doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA and ChAdOx1 vaccines was associated with substantial reductions in the risk of hospital admission due to COVID-19 in Scotland. There remains the possibility that some of the observed effects might have been due to residual confounding.

515813,Likely Exacerbation of Psychological Disorders from Covid-19 Response,2021,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus2 (SARS-CoV2) is responsible for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (CoViD-19), the pandemic that has afflicted close to two million people worldwide, and has taken the lives of over 120,000 patients since its first report in late December 2019. Per million people globally, the infection rate is close to 250 with a death rate of close to 14 (death rate average global death rate: 6.06%; for comparison, revised estimate of the 1918 influenza pandemic had an average global death rate of 5.4% [1]). About 400,000 SARS-CoV2-positive patients have been declared 'recovered', although it is not clear to date what exactly that entails. To be clear, the natural history of SARS-CoV2 infection and of the patho-physiology of CoViD-19 remains shrouded in relative confusion, in part due to the exceedingly virulent nature of the virus, as manifest by its elevated morbidity and mortality, and the fast accumulation of clinical observations and research evidence. Many pieces of a complex puzzle are emerging all at once and their organization into a coherent and cogent picture of the natural history of CoViD-19 is arduous and still wanting. Here, we discuss the recent findings in the context of the available evidence. We propose a putative prediction model of the natural history of CoViD-19. We highlight putative loci and modes of therapeutic intervention that may become beneficial preventive and treatment modalities for individuals at risk of SARS-CoV2 infection and CoViD-19 patients.","Chiappell, Francesco",Bioinformation,,560
516308,Commentary: Regulating Health Care Prices with One Hand Tied Behind Your Back: A Critical Evaluation of a Market-Oriented Proposal,2020,"A cardinal feature of COVID-19 is lung inflammation and respiratory failure. In a prospective multi-country cohort of COVID-19 patients, we found that increased Notch4 expression on circulating regulatory T (Treg) cells was associated with disease severity, predicted mortality, and declined upon recovery. Deletion of Notch4 in Treg cells or therapy with anti-Notch4 antibodies in conventional and humanized mice normalized the dysregulated innate immunity and rescued disease morbidity and mortality induced by a synthetic analog of viral RNA or by influenza H1N1 virus. Mechanistically, Notch4 suppressed the induction by interleukin-18 of amphiregulin, a cytokine necessary for tissue repair. Protection by Notch4 inhibition was recapitulated by therapy with Amphiregulin and, reciprocally, abrogated by its antagonism. Amphiregulin declined in COVID-19 subjects as a function of disease severity and Notch4 expression. Thus, Notch4 expression on Treg cells dynamically restrains amphiregulin-dependent tissue repair to promote severe lung inflammation, with therapeutic implications for COVID-19 and related infections.","Harb, Hani; Benamar, Mehdi; Lai, Peggy S; Contini, Paola; Griffith, Jason W; Crestani, Elena; Schmitz-Abe, Klaus; Chen, Qian; Fong, Jason; Marri, Luca; Filaci, Gilberto; Del Zotto, Genny; Pishesha, Novalia; Kolifrath, Stephen; Broggi, Achille; Ghosh, Sreya; Gelmez, Metin Yusuf; Oktelik, Fatma Betul; Cetin, Esin Aktas; Kiykim, Ayca; Kose, Murat; Wang, Ziwei; Cui, Ye; Yu, Xu G; Li, Jonathan Z; Berra, Lorenzo; Stephen-Victor, Emmanuel; Charbonnier, Louis-Marie; Zanoni, Ivan; Ploegh, Hidde; Deniz, Gunnur; De Palma, Raffaele; Chatila, Talal A",Immunity,,560
516454,Anxiety Reactions and Coping Modalities with the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study Comparing a Population of Religious Patients with Mental Illness and their Health Caregivers,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. As of March 30, 2020, there have been 693,224 reported patients with COVID-19 worldwide, with 1,446 in Japan. Currently, although aspects of the route of transmission are unclear, infection by contact and by inhaling droplets is considered to be the dominant transmission route. Inflammatory symptoms in the upper respiratory tract persist for several days to 1 week after onset, and in some patients symptoms of pneumonia worsen and become severe. The presence of underlying diseases and advanced age are risk factors for increased severity. Diagnosis is based on detection of SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum. Symptomatic management is the main treatment for this disease. Although the efficacy of several agents is currently being tested, at present there is no effective therapeutic agent. To prevent infection, in addition to standard preventive measures, measures that counteract infection by contact and droplet inhalation are important. In addition, if procedures that cause aerosolization of virus are used, then measures that prevent airborne infection should be implemented.","Kutsuna, Satoshi",Uirusu,,560
516914,Pandemic-related emergency psychiatric presentations for self-harm of children and adolescents in 10 countries (PREP-kids): a retrospective international cohort study,2021,"BACKGROUND Invasive mechanical ventilation can cause pulmonary barotrauma due to elevated transpulmonary pressure and alveolar rupture. A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) will require mechanical ventilation. We present 2 interesting cases that demonstrate the possibility of COVID-19-associated ARDS manifesting with pulmonary barotrauma at acceptable ventilatory pressures. CASE REPORT The first patient was a 71-year-old man who was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure from SARS-CoV-2 infection. His partial pressure of O2 to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2) was 156. He developed subcutaneous emphysema (SE) and pneumomediastinum on day 5 of mechanical ventilation at ventilatory settings of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) &#8804;15 cmH2O, plateau pressure (Pplat) &#8804;25 cmH2O and pulmonary inspiratory pressure (PIP) &#8804;30 cmH2O. He was managed with 'blow-hole' incisions, with subsequent clinical resolution of subcutaneous emphysema. The second patient was a 58-year-old woman who was also mechanically ventilated due to hypoxemic respiratory failure from COVID-19, with PaO2/FiO2 of 81. She developed extensive SE with pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax while on mechanical ventilation settings PEEP 13 cmH2O and PIP 28 cmH2O, Pplat 18 cmH2O, and FiO2 90%. SE was managed with blow-hole incisions and pneumothorax with chest tube. CONCLUSIONS Clinicians should be aware of pulmonary barotrauma as a possible complication of COVID-19 pulmonary disease, even at low ventilatory pressures.","Ezeagu, Raphael; Olanipekun, Titilope; Santoshi, Ratnam; Seneviratne, Chanaka; Kupfer, Yizhak",Am J Case Rep,,560

To evaluate the possible cause, incidence and levels of anxiety and depression in the relatives of the patients in the ICU in accordance with the patients' SARS-CoV-2 PCR result. MATERIALS AND METHOD: The study was prospectively conducted on relatives of patients admitted to tertiary intensive care units during COVID-19 pandemic. Sociodemographic characteristics of the patients and their relatives were recorded. ""The Turkish version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale"" survey was applied twice to the relatives of 120 patients to determine the symptoms of anxiety and depression in accordance with the PCR results of the patients (PCR positive n=60, PCR negative n=60). RESULTS: The ratios above cut-off values for anxiety and depression among relatives of the patients were 45.8% and 67.5% for the first test and 46.7% and 62.5% for the second test respectively. The anxiety and depression in the relatives of PCR positive patients was more frequent than the PCR negative (p< 0.001 for HADS-A and p=0.034 for HADS-D). The prevalence of anxiety and depression was significantly higher in female participants (p=0.046 for HADS-A and p=0.009 for HADS-A). There was no significant correlation between HADS and age of the patient or education of the participants. The fact that the patients were hospitalized in the ICU during the pandemic was an independent risk factor for anxiety (AUC = 0.746) while restriction of patient visiting in the ICU was found to be an independent risk factor for depression (AUC= 0.703). CONCLUSION: While patient with positive PCR and participant with female gender is responsible for both anxiety and depression, hospitalization in the ICU due to COVID-19 is an independent risk factor for anxiety and restriction of patient visiting in the ICU is an independent risk factor for depression.","Kosovali, Behiye Deniz; Mutlu, Nevzat Mehmet; Gonen, Canan Cam; Peker, Tulay Tuncer; Yavuz, Asiye; Soyal, Ozlem Balkiz; Cakir, Esra; Akan, Belgin; Gokcinar, Derya; Erdem, Deniz; Turan, Isil Ozkocak",Int J Clin Pract,,560

519152,Correction: Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Health Care Utilization in a Large Integrated Health Care System: Retrospective Cohort Study,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Potentially avoidable hospitalizations are disproportionately experienced by racial and ethnic minorities and expose these groups to unnecessary iatrogenic harm (including the risk of nosocomial COVID-19) and undue financial burden. In working toward an overarching goal of eliminating racial and ethnic health disparities, it is important to understand whether and to what extent potentially avoidable hospitalizations have changed by race and ethnicity during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This single-center pre-post study included patients admitted to any UCLA Health hospital for an ambulatory care-sensitive condition between March-August 2019 (prepandemic period) and March-August 2020 (postpandemic period). Investigators measured the change in the number of potentially avoidable hospitalizations (defined per the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guidelines) stratified by race and ethnicity and calculated the 95% CIs for these hospitalizations using a cluster bootstrap procedure. RESULTS: Between March 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020, 347 of 4,838 hospitalizations (7.2%) were potentially avoidable, compared with 557 of 6,248 (8.9%) during the same 6-month period in 2019. Potentially avoidable hospitalizations decreased by 50.3% (95% CI=41.2, 60.9) among non-Hispanic Whites but only by 8.0% (95% CI= -16.2, 39.9) among African Americans (50.3% vs 8.0%, p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Racial disparities in potentially avoidable hospitalizations increased during the COVID-19 pandemic at a large urban health system. Given that the prepandemic rates of potentially avoidable hospitalizations were already higher among racial and ethnic minorities, especially among African Americans, this finding should cause alarm and lead to further exploration of the complex factors contributing to these disparities.","Leuchter, Richard K; Villaflores, Chad Wes A; Norris, Keith C; Sorensen, Andrea; Vangala, Sitaram; Sarkisian, Catherine A",Am J Prev Med,,560

This study examined whether emotional disorder symptoms and transdiagnostic vulnerabilities during adolescence predicted young adult substance use during COVID-19, and whether using substances to cope with the pandemic's social conditions mediated these associations. Adolescents (N = 2,120) completed baseline surveys assessing transdiagnostic emotional vulnerabilities (anhedonia, distress intolerance, anxiety sensitivity, negative urgency) and symptoms (major depression[MD], generalized anxiety[GAD], panic disorder[PD], social phobia[SP], obsessive-compulsive disorder[OCD]) in adolescence (September-December 2016; M[SD] age = 17.45[0.38]). At follow-up (May-August 2020; M[SD] age = 21.16[0.39]), past 30-day substance use and using substances to cope with social isolation during the pandemic were reported. Adjusted models showed that baseline distress intolerance, anxiety sensitivity, negative urgency, and MD symptoms each significantly predicted higher number of past-month single-substance using days and number of substances used at follow-up (ßs = 0.04-0.06). In each case, associations were mediated by tendency to use substances to cope with the pandemic (ßindirect range: 0.028-0.061). To mitigate disproportionate escalation of substance use in young adults with a history of certain types of emotional disturbance, interventions promoting healthy coping strategies to deal with the pandemic's social conditions warrant consideration.","Cho, Junhan; Bello, Mariel S; Christie, Nina C; Monterosso, John R; Leventhal, Adam M",Cogn Behav Ther,,560

Highly pathogenic strains of influenza A, such as H5N1, have the capacity to cause severe illness or death in ferrets. The use of ferrets as a model of influenza infection is currently limited by a lack of species-specific immunological reagents. Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) plays a key role in the development of innate and adaptive immunity and the regulation of Th1-type immune responses. Here we describe the cloning of the full-length cDNA for ferret IFN-γ. Multiple sequence alignment of the predicted amino acid sequence with those of other species indicates that the predicted ferret protein shares the highest identity with Eurasian badger IFN-γ. We raised two hybridoma clones expressing monoclonal antibodies against recombinant ferret IFN-γ capable of detecting IFN-γ protein derived from mitogen-stimulated ferret PBMCs by immunoblotting, ELISA and ELISPOT assay.

As the health-care system is finally re-organizing to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, it was necessary to re-structure primary eye care (PEC) activities as well on the same lines. A consensus meeting was held with leading eye-care experts on 2(nd) May 2020 to prepare a roadmap for PEC in the days to come. Guidelines are needed for PEC activities like vision testing, refraction, optical dispensing, counseling, etc., Some of the activities at vision centers (VCs) may be postponed or modified in light of the current pandemic situation. PEC workers need to strictly follow social distancing norms (minimum 3 feet) for minimizing risk of exposure and need access to appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), like gloves, masks and shields while examining beneficiaries. For optometrists, sterilization of instruments and encouraging the people to remain silent during the examination is recommended. Because conjunctivitis may be an early sign which can present at VCs, extra precautions in the form of PPE has to be ensured while examining such patients. This is also an opportunity to start running telemedicine clinics for all emergent cases that cannot be managed at the primary level. The guidelines also need to be updated based on the context of the working environment and changes in government directives from time to time.","Vashist, Praveen; Senjam, Suraj S; Gupta, Vivek; Manna, Souvik; Agrawal, Surbhi; Gupta, Noopur; Sharma, Namrata; Sinha, Rajesh; Saxena, Rohit; Sachdev, Mahipal S",Indian J Ophthalmol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32587155/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.ijo_1527_20,560

A possible explanation for this might be the differences in immunological profiles in males and the elderly before the infection. Given the seasonal profile of COVID-19, the seasonal response against SARS-CoV-2 could also be different in these groups. Methods The abundance of circulating proteins and immune populations associated with severe COVID-19 was analyzed in 2 healthy cohorts. PBMCs of female, male, young, and old subjects in different seasons of the year were stimulated with heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2. Result Several T cell subsets, which are known to be depleted in severe COVID-19 patients, were intrinsically less abundant in men and older individuals. Plasma proteins increasing with disease severity, including HGF, IL-8, and MCP-1, were more abundant in the elderly and males. The elderly produced significantly more IL-1RA and had a dysregulated IFNγ response with lower production in the summer compared with young individuals. Conclusions The immune characteristics of severe COVID-19, described by a differential abundance of immune cells and circulating inflammatory proteins, are intrinsically present in healthy men and the elderly. This might explain the susceptibility of men and the elderly to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

As reported previously, BD‐604 is a fully human monoclonal antibody with strong in vitro and in vivo neutralizing activity to SARS‐COV‐2. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic propertie of BD‐604 in cynomolgus monkeys. METHODS: To analyze the concentration of BD‐604 in cynomolgus monkey serum, an ELISA assay was established, and a systemic validation was performed including accuracy and precision, dilution linearity and hook effect, selectivity, specificity, stability, and parallelism tests. Then, six naïve cynomolgus monkeys (3/sex) were administered BD‐604 at a single dose of 10 mg/kg via intravenous infusion (60 min). Blood samples were collected at various time points (0–672 h) and analyzed for serum concentrations of BD‐604. RESULTS: The data from validation experiments assure the reproducibility and reliability of the established ELISA assay. Then, the validated method was used to measure BD‐604 concentration in cynomolgus monkey serum. The pharmacokinetics parameters including terminal half‐life (t(1/2)), peak serum concentration (C(max)), area under curve from time zero to last timepoint or infinity (AUC(last)/AUC(inf)), apparent volume of distribution (V(z)), clearance rate (CL), and mean residence time (MRT) were calculated and reported. BD‐604 showed no marked sex differences at the dose of 10 mg/kg when comparing the AUC(0‐last) and C(max) between female and male cynomolgus monkeys.

593564,Applied techniques for putting pre-visit planning in clinical practice to empower patient-centered care in the pandemic era: a systematic review and framework suggestion,2021-05-13,"BACKGROUND: Patient and public involvement (PPI) can help with steering and shaping research prioritisation and execution. However, some groups of people may not be encouraged to take part and their voices may be seldom listened to in the production of research. This is important to consider because they may have poorer healthcare experiences. We tried using art as a vehicle for including individuals not necessarily invited to be part of research priority setting. METHODS: We contacted existing groups and organisations to reach people not routinely supported to be part of PPI. We targeted individuals: a) with dementia, b) with a mental and physical health condition, c) of South Asian heritage. We ran a workshop with each group at which individuals shared their experiences of healthcare. A young amateur artist also attended, who produced a piece of artwork afterwards that reflected the research priorities raised. We held a Twitter chat to discuss these pieces of art and the processes involved in their generation. RESULTS: From each workshop, we produced a list of research priorities. These included: a) improving coordination of care for people with dementia, b) information needs and anxiety/guilt around accessing care for people with physical and mental health conditions, c) supporting discussion of women’s health issues in South Asian communities. These priorities were reflected in three pieces of art, which can be viewed online. Feedback from those at workshops suggested that the artwork helped them to feel that their voice had been heard and triggered their interest in how research is developed. Those involved in the Twitter chat commented that art was one means through which researchers could connect with a range of groups in a PPI context when preparing and producing a study. CONCLUSIONS: We found the medium of art to be an effective way of including a range of people in research prioritisation setting. This approach could be useful for future PPI, building on what we have learnt from the project described in this paper.","Tierney, Stephanie; Dawson, Shoba; Boylan, Anne-Marie; Richards, Gillian; Park, Sophie; Turk, Amadea; Babatunde, Opeyemi",Res Involv Engagem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33407929/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40900-020-00244-z,560

Very recently, we genetically linked a short-peptide fusion inhibitor with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) attachment signal, rendering modified cells fully resistant to HIV infection. In this study, GPI-anchored m36.4, a single-domain antibody (nanobody) targeting the coreceptor-binding site of gp120, was constructed with a lentiviral vector. We verified that m36.4 was efficiently expressed on the plasma membrane of transduced TZM-bl cells and targeted lipid raft sites without affecting the expression of HIV receptors (CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4). Significantly, TZM-bl cells expressing GPI-m36.4 were highly resistant to infection with divergent HIV-1 subtypes and potently blocked HIV-1 envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion and cell-cell viral transmission. Furthermore, we showed that GPI-m36.4-modified human CEMss-CCR5 cells were nonpermissive to both CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 isolates and displayed a strong survival advantage over unmodified cells.

In conclusion, our studies characterize m36.4 as a powerful nanobody that can generate HIV-resistant cells, offering a novel gene therapy approach that can be used alone or in combination.","Jin, Hongliang; Tang, Xiaoran; Li, Li; Chen, Yue; Zhu, Yuanmei; Chong, Huihui; He, Yuxian",Cell Mol Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41423-020-00627-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33462383/,560
595446,Dental Facilities During the New Corona Outbreak: A SWOT Analysis,2020-08-25,"BACKGROUND: There are no reliable signs or symptoms that differentiate Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mp) infection in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) from other etiologies. Additionally, current diagnostic tests do not reliably distinguish between Mp infection and carriage. We previously determined that the measurement of Mp-specific immunoglobulin M antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) by enzyme-linked immunospot assay allowed for differentiation between infection and carriage. Using this new diagnostic test, we aimed to identify clinical and laboratory features associated with Mp infection. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of children, 3–18 years of age, with CAP from 2016 to 2017. Clinical features and biomarkers were compared between Mp-positive and -negative groups by Mann-Whitney U test or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) differences and optimal thresholds were determined by using the DeLong test and Youden J statistic, respectively. RESULTS: Of 63 CAP patients, 29 were Mp-positive (46%). Mp positivity was statistically associated with older age (median, 8.6 vs 4.7 years), no underlying disease, family with respiratory symptoms, prior antibiotic treatment, prolonged prodromal respiratory symptoms and fever, and extrapulmonary (skin) manifestations. Lower levels of C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, and procalcitonin (PCT), specifically PCT <0.25 μg/L, were statistically associated with Mp infection. A combination of age >5 years (AUC = 0.77), prodromal fever and respiratory symptoms >6 days (AUC = 0.79), and PCT <0.25 μg/L (AUC = 0.81) improved diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.90) (P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: A combination of clinical features and biomarkers may aid physicians in identifying patients at high risk for Mp CAP.","Meyer Sauteur, Patrick M; Krautter, Selina; Ambroggio, Lilliam; Seiler, Michelle; Paioni, Paolo; Relly, Christa; Capaul, Riccarda; Kellenberger, Christian; Haas, Thorsten; Gysin, Claudine; Bachmann, Lucas M; van Rossum, Annemarie M C; Berger, Christoph",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665253/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciz1059,560
597019,Persistent symptoms after Covid-19: qualitative study of 114 “long Covid” patients and draft quality principles for services,2020-12-20,"BACKGROUND: Detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among people at risk of infection is crucial for understanding both the past transmission of COVID-19 and vulnerability of the population to continuing transmission and, when done serially, the intensity of ongoing transmission over an interval in a community. We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in a representative population-based cohort in Iquitos, one of the regions with the highest mortality rates from COVID-19 in Peru, where a devastating number of cases occurred in March, 2020. METHODS: We did a population-based study of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Iquitos at two timepoints: July 13–18, 2020 (baseline), and Aug 13–18, 2020 (1-month follow-up). We obtained a geographically stratified representative sample of the city population using the 2017 census data, which was updated on Jan 20, 2020. We included people who were inhabitants of Iquitos since COVID-19 was identified in Peru (March 6, 2020) or earlier. We excluded people living in institutions, people receiving any pharmacological treatment for COVID-19, people with any contraindication for phlebotomy, and health workers or individuals living with an active health worker. We tested each participant for IgG and IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test (Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech, China). We used survey analysis methods to estimate seroprevalence accounting for the sampling design effect and test performance characteristics. FINDINGS: We identified 726 eligible individuals and enrolled a total of 716 participants (99%), distributed across 40 strata (four districts, two sexes, and five age groups). We excluded ten individuals who: did not have consent from a parent or legal representative (n=3), had moved to Iquitos after March 6, 2020 (n=3), were in transit (n=2), or had respiratory symptoms (n=1). After adjusting for the study sampling effects and sensitivity and specificity of the test, we estimated a seroprevalence of 70% (95% CI 67–73) at baseline and 66% (95% CI 62–70) at 1 month of follow-up, with a test-retest positivity of 65% (95% CI 61–68), and an incidence of new exposures of 2% (95% CI 1–3). We observed significant differences in the seroprevalence between age groups, with participants aged 18–29 years having lower seroprevalence than those aged younger than 12 years (prevalence ratio 0·85 [95% CI 0·73–0·98]; p=0·029). INTERPRETATION: After the first epidemic peak, Iquitos had one of the highest rates of seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies worldwide. Nevertheless, the city experienced a second wave starting in January, 2021, probably due to the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 P1 variant, which has shown higher transmissibility and reinfection rates.

597213,Factors Associated With Job Satisfaction of Frontline Medical Staff Fighting Against COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Study in China,2020-08-04,"Within 4 months of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, more than 250 nucleotide mutations have been detected in ORF1ab of the virus isolated from infected persons from different parts of the globe. These observations open up an obvious question about the rate and direction of mutational pressure for further vaccine and therapeutics designing. In this study, we did a comparative analysis of ORF1a and ORF1b by using the first isolate (Wuhan strain) as the parent sequence. We observed that most of the nucleotide mutations are C to U transitions. The rate of synonymous C to U transitions is significantly higher than the rate of non-synonymous ones, indicating negative selection on amino acid substitutions. Further, trends in nucleotide usage bias have been investigated in 49 coronaviruses species. A strong bias in nucleotide usage in fourfold degenerate sites toward uracil residues is seen in ORF1ab of all the studied coronaviruses: both in the ORF1a and in the ORF1b translated thanks to the programmed ribosomal frameshifting that has an efficiency of 14 – 45% in different species. A more substantial mutational U-pressure is observed in ORF1a than in ORF1b perhaps because ORF1a is translated more frequently than ORF1b. Mutational U-pressure is there even in ORFs that are not translated from genomic RNA plus strands, but the bias is weaker than in ORF1ab. Unlike other nucleotide mutations, mutational U-pressure caused by cytosine deamination, mostly occurring during the RNA plus strand replication and also translation, cannot be corrected by the proof-reading machinery of coronaviruses. The knowledge generated on the mutational U-pressure that becomes stronger during translation of viral RNA plus strands has implications for vaccine and nucleoside analog development for treating COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections.","Khrustalev, Vladislav Victorovich; Giri, Rajanish; Khrustaleva, Tatyana Aleksandrovna; Kapuganti, Shivani Krishna; Stojarov, Aleksander Nicolaevich; Poboinev, Victor Vitoldovich",Front Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.559165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33072018/,560

This study aimed to evaluate the changes in dietary habits and lifestyle during the COVID-19 lockdown a specific population with academic and professional knowledge in food sciences from Spain. An online questionnaire, based on 41 items, including sociodemographic data, dietary habits, food-related behaviors, and lifestyle were distributed using academic and institutional mailing lists and social media. Results showed a higher intake of fruit and vegetables, legumes, eggs, fish, and yogurt together with a decrease in consumption of alcoholic beverages between before and during the lockdown period. Nevertheless, an increase in consumption of some fruitive foods and an increase in self-reported weight were also observed, although in lower percentages than in other populations. A worse sleep quality and an increase in working hours and sitting time were also reported.

Prolonged fears about memory loss and dementia can have harmful consequences even in the absence of cognitive decline. Fear of dementia is associated with poorer health outcomes and psychological well-being and increased memory failures in older adults. OBJECTIVE: We will conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine the feasibility of a tailored, web-based mindfulness program to reduce fear of memory loss and increase quality of life in older adults experiencing heightened fear. METHODS: Eighty participants will be recruited and divided into 2 groups (40 in each group). One group will receive psychoeducation plus mindfulness training. A second group will receive psychoeducation, mindfulness training, and additional modules targeting maladaptive behavioral avoidance (ie, social and cognitive withdrawal). RESULTS: Our recent etiological model posits that maladaptive behavioral avoidance strategies critically underlie psychosocial dysfunction associated with fear of memory loss. Thus, we predict better outcomes in the second group, including reduced fear of memory loss (primary outcome), Alzheimer disease, anxiety, and subjective memory failures, and increased quality of life (secondary outcomes). Outcome measures will be applied at 5 time points (before, baseline, interim, and after the intervention, and at 3-month follow-up). Data will be analyzed using mixed models and correlations. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study will contribute to the current literature on dementia-related fear and improve our understanding of how to effectively address and reduce these fears.

Thus, the continued search for new antiretroviral agents with unique and different mechanisms of HIV inhibition remains critical, and compounds that can reduce the level of virus production from cells already infected with HIV, as opposed to preventing de novo infection, would be of great benefit. A mercaptobenzamide (MDH-1-38) and its prodrug (NS1040) are being developed as potential therapeutic compounds targeting the zinc finger of HIV nucleocapsid. In the presence of esterase enzymes, NS1040 is designed to be converted to MDH-1-38 which has antiviral activity. While we presume that NS1040 is rapidly converted to MDH-1-38 in all experiments, the two compounds were tested side-by-side to determine whether the presence of a prodrug affects the antiviral activity or mechanism of action. The two compounds were evaluated against a panel of HIV-1 clinical isolates in human PBMCs and monocyte-macrophages and yielded EC(50) values ranging from 0.7 to 13 μM with no toxicity up to 100 μM. MDH-1-38 and NS1040 remained equally active in human PBMCs in the presence of added serum proteins as well as against HIV-1 isolates resistant to reverse transcriptase, integrase or protease inhibitors. Cell-based and biochemical mechanism of antiviral action assays demonstrated MDH-1-38 and NS1040 were virucidal at concentrations of 15 and 50 μM, respectively. Cell to cell transmission of HIV in multiple passages was significantly reduced in CEM-SS and human PBMCs by reducing progeny virus infectivity at compound concentrations greater than 2 μM. The combination of either MDH-1-38 or NS1040 with other FDA-approved HIV drugs yielded additive to synergistic antiviral interactions with no evidence of antiviral antagonism or synergistic toxicity. Serial dose escalation was used in attempts to select for HIV strains resistant to MDH-1-38 and NS1040. Virus at several passages failed to replicate in cells treated at increased compound concentrations, which is consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of the virus inactivating compounds. Through 14 passages, resistance to the compounds has not been achieved. Most HIV inhibitors with mechanism of antiviral action targeting a viral protein would have selected for a drug resistant virus within 14 passages. These studies indicate that these NCp7-targeted compounds represent new potent anti-HIV drug candidates which could be effectively used in combination with all approved anti-HIV drugs.","Hartman, T.L.; Yang, L.; Helfrick, A.N.; Hassink, M.; Shank, N.I.; George Rosenker, K.; Scerba, M.T.; Saha, M.; Hughes, E.; Wang, A.Q.; Xu, X.; Gupta, P.; Buckheit, R.W.; Appella, D.H.",Antiviral Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216303175; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354216303175; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27568924/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.08.022,560

Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. On March 2, 2020, Indonesia announced the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. East Kalimantan will play an important role as the new capital of Indonesia. There is attention to the preparedness of East Kalimantan to respond to COVID-19. We report the characteristics of COVID-19 fatality cases in here. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed the fatality cases of COVID-19 patients from the East Kalimantan Health Office information system. All patients were confirmed COVID-19 by RT-PCR examination. Results. By July 31, 2020, 31 fatality cases of patients had been identified as having confirmed COVID-19 in East Kalimantan. The mean age of the patients was 55.1 + 9.2 years. Most of the patients were men (22 [71.0%]) with age more than 60 years old (14 [45.2%]). Balikpapan has the highest number of COVID-19 fatality cases from all regencies. Hypertension was the most comorbidities in the fatality cases of COVID-19 patients in East Kalimantan. Discussion. Older age and comorbidities still contributed to the fatality cases of COVID-19 patients in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease were underlying conditions for increasing the risk of COVID-19 getting into a serious condition. Conclusion.

601448,Prevalence and Factors associated with Mental health impact of COVID-19 Pandemic in Bangladesh: A survey-based cross-sectional study,2021-01-06,"As a newly emerging virus, little is known about the SARS coronavirus, whose outbreak has brought away several hundred people’s lives over the world in the year of 2003 and is seriously imperiling the human health. Revealing the denaturation and replication mechanisms of SARS coronavirus has great importance for successfully fighting SARS. However, experiments related to SARS coronavirus are extremely dangerous and therefore restricted only to certain specific labs with high safety standard. Clearly, predicting the behaviors of SARS coronavirus in a wide variety of environmental conditions, which are not easily accessible, are thus critically necessary. In this study, we proposed to quantify the survival time of SARS coronavirus either in vitro or in vivo, through introducing thermal rate process models established from the well-known Arrhenius law. The complex physical and chemical behaviors of the SARS coronavirus can then be attributed to its activation energy, frequency factor, damage function as well as the surrounding environmental conditions. Based on the first data on stability and resistance of SARS coronavirus measured by members of WHO laboratory network, the rate coefficients involved in the above equations were estimated for the first time. Predictions on the survival time of SARS coronavirus in different temperature scale were then performed. It was found theoretically that, such survival time falls in an extremely wide range, say from several seconds in high temperature to an almost infinitely long time in a low temperature environment, which has already or is being supported by the currently available tests data. Applications of the present theory to interpret several existing phenomena were presented and their implementations in developing new technical ways for SARS prevention and clinical therapy were discussed. Uncertainties involved in the theoretical models were also analyzed and predicted. Parametric studies were performed to test the effects of the rate coefficients to the survival time of SARS coronavirus. Some important factors, which can significantly vary the denaturation or replication process of SARS coronavirus were pointed out. Through regulating the parameters involved in the equation, certain potential therapies either through drug delivery or engineering approach to treat the SARS disease can possibly be established. Extension of the present model for further studies was also suggested. This study opens a new theoretical way for probing into the complex behaviors of SARS coronavirus. Modellierung der Denaturierung oder Repliziryng von SARS-Korona-Viren Zusammenfassung Der Kenntnisstand über die Eigenschaften des in 2003 neu aufgetretenen SARS Korona Virus, der einige Hundert Menschenleben gekostet hat, ist relativ gering. Die Ermittlung des Denaturierungs- und Replizierungsmechanismuses des SARS Virus ist für seine Bekämpfung von hoher Bedeutung. Experimentelle Untersuchungen an diesem extrem gefährlichen Virus dürfen nur durch Laboratorien mit einem hohen Sicherheitsstandard erfolgen. Die Vorhersage des Verhaltens des SARS Virus in unterschiedlichen Umgebungsbedingungen ist dabei erforderlich. In der vorliegenden Studie wird die überlebensdauer des Virus unter Labor- und realen Bedingungen durch Anwendung der bekannten Arrhenius-Beziehung für temperaturabhängige Vorgänge ermittelt. Das physikalische und chemische Verhalten des SARS Virus wird anhand der zugrundeliegenden Modell- Parameter beschrieben. Basierend auf den ersten Messungen von Mitgliedern des WHO-laboratory-network über die Stabilität und Widerstandsfähigkeit des Virus wurden erstmalig die Geschwindigkeitskoeffizienten des Berechnungsmodells bestimmt. Vorhersagen der Überlebensdauer des SARS-Virus unter unterschiedlichen Temperaturbedingungen wurden ausgeführt. Das sich hieraus ergebende, sehr unterschiedliche Ausmaß der Überlebensfähigkeit in Abhängigkeit der Umgebungstemperatur ist durch den Vergleich mit verfügbaren experimentellen Ergebnissen bestätigt worden. Die Anwendung der vorgestellten Modellierung zur Interpretation realer Phänomene und zur Entwicklung technischer Maßnahmen zur Vorbeugung und klinischen Therapierung von SARS wird diskutiert. Der Einfluß von Unsicherheiten des Modells wird analysiert und abgeschätzt. Parametrische Studien sind durchgeführt worden, um den Einfluß der Geschwindigkeitskoeffizienten auf die Überlebensdauer des SARS Virus darzustellen. Einige wichtige Einflußgrößen auf die Denaturierung und Replikationsfähigkeit des SARS Virus werden aufgezeigt. Durch eine Variation der Modellparameter kann die potentielle Wirksamkeit medikamentöser oder physikalischer Therapien abgeschätzt werden. Erweiterungsmöglichkeiten des vorgestellten Modells werden vorgeschlagen.

The main problem with the traditional approach for assessing urban PT development is that economic and social benefits are considered individually, but also attention to environmental factors and coordination among the three issues are nearly overlooked. This leads to the likelihood of inaccuracies in the handling/assessment of sustainable development or an imbalance among the attributes in different cities. An investigation-based coordinated model was introduced in which a survey of 35 sub-criteria was conducted to derive the criteria necessary for coupling/coordination. A case study involving 13 cities in Jiangsu Province, China, illustrated the problems in coordinating PT systems and verified the efficacy of the proposed approach. With employing the entropy method, this study validated coordination of the PT infrastructure development of various cities in a balanced manner and used panel regression formulas to analyse the theoretical gap and empirical bottlenecks existing among economic, social and environmental benefits.

After immunizing these mice with DNA encoding the spike protein of SARS‐CoV‐2 and boosting with spike protein, we identified 29 hybridoma antibodies that reacted with the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein. Nine antibodies neutralize SARS‐CoV‐2 infection at IC50 values in the subnanomolar range. ELISA‐binding studies and DNA sequence analyses revealed one cluster of three clonally related neutralizing antibodies that target the receptor‐binding domain and compete with the cellular receptor hACE2. A second cluster of six clonally related neutralizing antibodies bind to the N‐terminal domain of the spike protein without competing with the binding of hACE2 or cluster 1 antibodies. SARS‐CoV‐2 mutants selected for resistance to an antibody from one cluster are still neutralized by an antibody from the other cluster. Antibodies from both clusters markedly reduced viral spread in mice transgenic for human ACE2 and protected the animals from SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced weight loss. The two clusters of potent non‐competing SARS‐CoV‐2 neutralizing antibodies provide potential candidates for therapy and prophylaxis of COVID‐19.

One air sample (1 of 18 samples, 5.5%) tested positive for influenza B virus. Of the 40 surface samples, 7 (17.5%) were positive for pathogens. These were human adenovirus (3 out of 7, 42.8%), human coronavirus OC43/HKU1 (3 out of 7, 42.8%), Haemophilus influenzae (1 out of 7, 14.2%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (1 out of 7, 14.2%). Chair handles were the most commonly contaminated surfaces. The handles of 1 chair were cocontaminated with coronavirus OC43/HKU1 and H influenzae. CONCLUSION: Respiratory pathogens were detected in the air and on surfaces in the KAAI Airport in Pilgrims City. Larger-scale studies based on our study are warranted to determine the role of the environment in transmission of respiratory pathogens during mass gathering events (eg, Hajj) such that public health preventative measures might be better targeted.","Memish, Ziad A.; Almasri, Malak; Assirri, Abdullah; Al-Shangiti, Ali M.; Gray, Gregory C.; Lednicky, John A.; Yezli, Saber",Am J Infect Control,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655314010293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25465254/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655314010293; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2014.07.027,560

607549,Risk factors for COVID-19 mortality in hospitalised children and adolescents in Brazil,2021-09-15,"In December 2019, China reported the first cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). This disease, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome‐related coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), has developed into a pandemic. To date it has resulted in ~6.5 million confirmed cases and caused almost 400,000 related deaths worldwide. Unequivocally, the COVID‐19 pandemic is the gravest health and socio‐economic crisis of our time. In this context, numerous questions have emerged in demand of basic scientific information and evidence‐based medical advice on SARS‐CoV‐2 and COVID‐19. Although the majority of the patients show a very mild, self‐limiting viral respiratory disease, many clinical manifestations in severe patients are unique to COVID‐19, such as severe lymphopenia and eosinopenia, extensive pneumonia, a “cytokine storm” leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome, endothelitis, thrombo‐embolic complications and multiorgan failure. The epidemiologic features of COVID‐19 are distinctive and have changed throughout the pandemic. Vaccine and drug development studies and clinical trials are rapidly growing at an unprecedented speed. However, basic and clinical research on COVID‐19‐related topics should be based on more coordinated high‐quality studies. This paper answers pressing questions, formulated by young clinicians and scientists, on SARS‐CoV‐2, COVID‐19 and allergy, focusing on the following topics: virology, immunology, diagnosis, management of patients with allergic disease and asthma, treatment, clinical trials, drug discovery, vaccine development and epidemiology. Over 140 questions were answered by experts in the field providing a comprehensive and practical overview of COVID‐19 and allergic disease.","Riggioni, Carmen; Comberiati, Pasquale; Giovannini, Mattia; Agache, Ioana; Akdis, Mübeccel; Alves‐Correia, Magna; Antó, Josep M.; Arcolaci, Alessandra; Kursat Azkur, Ahmet; Azkur, Dilek; Beken, Burcin; Boccabella, Cristina; Bousquet, Jean; Breiteneder, Heimo; Carvalho, Daniela; De las Vecillas, Leticia; Diamant, Zuzana; Eguiluz‐Gracia, Ibon; Eiwegger, Thomas; Eyerich, Stefanie; Fokkens, Wytske; Gao, Ya‐dong; Hannachi, Farah; Johnston, Sebastian L.; Jutel, Marek; Karavelia, Aspasia; Klimek, Ludger; Moya, Beatriz; Nadeau, Kari; O'Hehir, Robyn; O'Mahony, Liam; Pfaar, Oliver; Sanak, Marek; Schwarze, Jürgen; Sokolowska, Milena; Torres, María J.; van de Veen, Willem; van Zelm, Menno C.; Wang, De Yun; Zhang, Luo; Jiménez‐Saiz, Rodrigo; Akdis, Cezmi A.",Allergy,https://doi.org/10.1111/all.14449; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32535955/,560

Vaccines are used extensively in veterinary medicine, and innovative vaccine technologies such as recombinant DNA-vectored and distinguishing infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) vaccines and automated in ovo vaccination (of embryonated chicken eggs) have been rapidly adopted commercially. Immunological research using outbred, nonrodent animal models has contributed to a broader understanding of mucosal defenses, and has provided the initial impetus for investigation of the common mucosal immune system. Studies of the potential of novel adjuvants to improve vaccine efficacy against genetically unstable, immune-subverting RNA viruses, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in pigs, should assist in the control of pathogens with similar characteristics in other species. Successful development of vaccines to prevent and treat ascending infections of the reproductive tract of cattle set a precedent for applications in other species including humans. Studies of mucosal adjuvants and delivery systems continue at the interface between passive and active immunity, with the goal of inducing the earliest possible protection against enteric and respiratory pathogens of neonates.","Hodgins, Douglas C.; Chattha, Kuldeep; Vlasova, Anastasia; Parreño, Viviana; Corbeil, Lynette B.; Renukaradhya, Gourapura J.; Saif, Linda J.",Mucosal Immunology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124158474000689; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124158474000689,560

608534,"“It changed everything”: The safe Home care qualitative study of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on home care aides, clients, and managers",2021-10-05,"BACKGROUND: With the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, many healthcare facilities are lacking a steady supply of masks worldwide. This emergency situation warrants the taking of extraordinary measures to minimize the negative health impact from an insufficient supply of masks. The decontamination, and reuse of healthcare workers’ N95/FFP2 masks is a promising solution which needs to overcome several pitfalls to become a reality. AIM: The overall aim of this article is to provide the reader with a quick overview of the various methods for decontamination and the potential issues to be taken into account when deciding to reuse masks. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), hydrogen peroxide, steam, ozone, ethylene oxide, dry heat and moist heat have all been methods studied in the context of the pandemic. The article first focuses on the logistical implementation of a decontamination system in its entirety, and then aims to summarize and analyze the different available methods for decontamination. METHODS: In order to have a clear understanding of the research that has already been done, we conducted a systematic literature review for the questions: what are the tested methods for decontaminating N95/FFP2 masks, and what impact do those methods have on the microbiological contamination and physical integrity of the masks? We used the results of a systematic review on the methods of microbiological decontamination of masks to make sure we covered all of the recommended methods for mask reuse. To this systematic review we added articles and studies relevant to the subject, but that were outside the limits of the systematic review. These include a number of studies that performed important fit and function tests on the masks but took their microbiological outcomes from the existing literature and were thus excluded from the systematic review, but useful for this paper. We also used additional unpublished studies and internal communication from the University of Geneva Hospitals and partner institutions. RESULTS: This paper analyzes the acceptable methods for respirator decontamination and reuse, and scores them according to a number of variables that we have defined as being crucial (including cost, risk, complexity, time, etc.) to help healthcare facilities decide which method of decontamination is right for them. CONCLUSION: We provide a resource for healthcare institutions looking at making informed decisions about respirator decontamination. This informed decision making will help to improve infection prevention and control measures, and protect healthcare workers during this crucial time. The overall take home message is that institutions should not reuse respirators unless they have to. In the case of an emergency situation, there are some safe ways to decontaminate them.","Peters, Alexandra; Palomo, Rafael; Ney, Hervé; Lotfinejad, Nasim; Zingg, Walter; Parneix, Pierre; Pittet, Didier",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13756-021-00921-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34051855/,560

OBJECTIVES: Identify candidate pathogens in pediatric patients with unexplained respiratory disease. STUDY DESIGN: Forty-four nasopharyngeal washes collected during the 2004-05 winter season from pediatric patients with respiratory illnesses that tested negative for 7 common respiratory pathogens by culture and direct immunofluorescence assays were analyzed by MassTag-PCR. To distinguish human enteroviruses (HEV) and rhinoviruses (HRV), samples positive for picornaviruses were further characterized by sequence analysis. RESULTS: Candidate pathogens were detected by MassTag PCR in 27 of the 44 (61%) specimens that previously were rated negative. Sixteen of these 27 specimens (59%) contained picornaviruses; of these 9 (57%) contained RNA of a recently discovered clade of rhinoviruses. Bocaviruses were detected in three patients by RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that multiplex MassTag-PCR enhances the detection of pathogens in clinical specimens, and shows that previously unrecognized rhinoviruses, that potentially form a species HRV-C, may cause a significant amount of pediatric respiratory disease.","Dominguez, Samuel R.; Briese, Thomas; Palacios, Gustavo; Hui, Jeffrey; Villari, Joseph; Kapoor, Vishal; Tokarz, Rafal; Glodé, Mary P.; Anderson, Marsha S.; Robinson, Christine C.; Holmes, Kathryn V.; Lipkin, W.

The simplest invertible iterated map, exponential growth and decay, emerges from country-wide histograms whenever Tchebychev’s inequality is satisfied to within several decimal places. This is one point. Another is that failed covid-19 pandemic model predictions have been reported repeatedly by the news media. Model predictions fail because the observed infection rates are beyond modeling: any model that uses fixed rates or uses memory or averages of past rates cannot reproduce the data on active infections. When those possibilities are ruled out, then little is left. Under lockdown and social distancing, the rates unfold daily in small but unforeseeable steps, they are algorithmically complex. We can, however, use two days in the daily data, today and any single day in the past (generally yesterday), to make a useful forecast of future infections. No model provides results better than this simple forecast. We analyze the actual doubling times for covid-19 data and compare them with our predicted doubling times. Flattening and peaking are precisely defined. We identify and study the separate effects of social distancing vs recoveries in the daily infection rates. Social distancing can only cause flattening but recoveries are required in order for the active infections to peak and decay. Three models and their predictions are analyzed. Pandemic data for Austria, Germany, Italy, the USA, the UK, Finland, China, Taiwan, and Sweden are discussed.","McCauley, Joseph L.",AIP Adv,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0015303; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33304642/,560

To date no trial comparing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) has been performed. METHODS: Hospitalized patients ≥18 years old with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were treated with either HCQ or LPV/RTV if they had either respiratory insufficiency (SpO(2) ≤ 93% on room air or the need for oxygen insufflation) or bilateral consolidations on chest X‑ray and at least 2 comorbidities associated with poor COVID-19 prognosis. Outcomes investigated included in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of stay, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) negativity and side effects of treatment. RESULTS: Of 156 patients (41% female) with a median age of 72 years (IQR 55.25–81) admitted to our department, 67 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (20 received HCQ, 47 LPV/RTV). Groups were comparable regarding most baseline characteristics. Median time from symptom onset to treatment initiation was 8 days and was similar between the groups (p = 0.727). There was no significant difference (HCQ vs. LPV/RTV) in hospital mortality (15% vs. 8.5%, p = 0.418), ICU admission rate (20% vs. 12.8%, p = 0.470) and length of stay (9 days vs. 11 days, p = 0.340). A PCR negativity from nasopharyngeal swabs was observed in approximately two thirds of patients in both groups. Side effects led to treatment discontinuation in 15% of patients in the LPV/RTV group. CONCLUSION: No statistically significant differences were observed in outcome parameters in patients treated with HCQ or LPV/RTV but patients in the LPV/RTV group showed a numerically lower hospital mortality rate. Additionally, in comparison to other studies we demonstrated a lower mortality in patients treated with LPV/RTV despite having similar patient groups, perhaps due to early initiation of treatment.","Karolyi, Mario; Pawelka, Erich; Mader, Theresa; Omid, Sara; Kelani, Hasan; Ely, Sarah; Jilma, Bernd; Baumgartner, Sebastian; Laferl, Hermann; Ott, Clemens; Traugott, Marianna; Turner, Michael; Seitz, Tamara; Wenisch, Christoph; Zoufaly, Alexander",Wien Klin Wochenschr,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00508-020-01720-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32776298/,560

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We undertook interviews with 44 healthcare professionals with a background in informatics from six hospitals internationally. Interviews were informed by a topic guide and were conducted via videoconferencing software. Thematic analysis was employed to develop a coding framework and identify emerging themes. RESULTS: Three themes and six sub-themes were identified. HITs were employed to manage time and resources during a surge in patient numbers through fast-tracked governance procedures, and the creation of real-time bed capacity tracking within electronic health records. Improving the integration of different hospital systems was identified as important across sites. The use of hard-stop alerts and order sets were perceived as being effective at helping to respond to potential medication shortages and selecting available drug treatments. Utilizing information from multiple data sources to develop alerts facilitated treatment. Finally, the upscaling/optimization of telehealth and remote working capabilities was used to reduce the risk of nosocomial infection within hospitals. DISCUSSION: A number of the HIT-related changes implemented at these sites were perceived to have facilitated more effective patient treatment and management of resources. Informaticians generally felt more valued by hospital management as a result.

We identified sixteen compounds that potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication, of which five compounds displayed equal or even higher antiviral activity compared to Remdesivir. These results show that five compounds should be further investigated for their mode of action, safety and efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Highlights 400 compounds from the pandemic response box were tested for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. 5 compounds had an equal or higher antiviral efficacy towards SARS-CoV-2, compared to the nucleoside analogue Remdesivir.","Holwerda, Melle; V’kovski, Philip; Wider, Manon; Thiel, Volker; Dijkman, Ronald",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.17.100404,560
627658,8 vragen over buikligging bij covid-patiënten,2021-06-04,"In low-income and middle-income countries, most patients with febrile illnesses present to peripheral levels of the health system where diagnostic capacity is very limited. In these contexts, accurate risk stratification can be particularly impactful, helping to guide allocation of scarce resources to ensure timely and tailored care. However, reporting of prognostic research is often imprecise and few prognostic tests or algorithms are translated into clinical practice. Here, we review the often-conflated concepts of prognosis and diagnosis, with a focus on patients with febrile illnesses. Drawing on a recent global stakeholder consultation, we apply these concepts to propose three use-cases for prognostic tools in the management of febrile illnesses in resource-limited settings: (1) guiding referrals from the community to higher-level care; (2) informing resource allocation for patients admitted to hospital and (3) identifying patients who may benefit from closer follow-up post-hospital discharge. We explore the practical implications for new technologies and reflect on the challenges and knowledge gaps that must be addressed before this approach could be incorporated into routine care settings. Our intention is that these use-cases, alongside other recent initiatives, will help to promote a harmonised yet contextualised approach for prognostic research in febrile illness. We argue that this is especially important given the heterogeneous settings in which care is often provided for patients with febrile illnesses living in low-income and middle-income countries.","Chandna, Arjun; Osborn, Jennifer; Bassat, Quique; Bell, David; Burza, Sakib; D’Acremont, Valérie; Fernandez-Carballo, B Leticia; Kain, Kevin C; Mayxay, Mayfong; Wiens, Matthew; Dittrich, Sabine",BMJ Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-006057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34330761/,560

These viruses have evolved diverse strategies to evade and block host immune responses, facilitating infection and transmission. Pathogenesis following infection with these viruses is characterized by a marked delay in the induction of Type I interferon (IFN I) and, subsequently, by a poor adaptive immune response. Therapies that expedite IFN I induction as well as interventions that antagonize immunoevasive virus proteins are thus promising candidates for immune modulation.","Vijay, Rahul; Perlman, Stanley",Current Opinion in Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879625716000146; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625716000146; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2016.01.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26855039/,560

DESIGN: An exploratory systematic approach was used to identify the contributions of civil society to food security through reports in news websites and Facebook posts. Data were analysed based on content analysis following a deductive–inductive approach. SETTING: Uruguay, Latin America. RESULTS: A total of 1220 civil society organisations were identified, which developed two main actions to increase access to food among the Uruguayan population: food baskets and ‘community pots’ (also known as ‘common pots’). Most of the initiatives targeted citizens under socioeconomic vulnerability in the face of COVID-19, without specifying any specific requirement or population segment. Actions were mainly led by spontaneously organised community groups, and, to a lesser extent, by consolidated organisations. Interactions between organisations were identified. The foods provided by the organisations were mostly aligned with national dietary guidelines. Social media posts evidenced that the main challenge faced by organisations was related to the lack of funds or supplies. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this work suggest that the lack of funds or supplies poses challenges to the medium- and long-term contributions of civil society to food security and stresses the need for comprehensive governmental measures to guarantee food security amongst Uruguayan citizens.","Brunet, Gerónimo; Girona, Alejandra; Fajardo, Gabriela; Iragola, Valentina; Machín, Leandro; Bove, Isabel; Ares, Gastón",Public health nutrition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34392866/; https://doi.org/10.1017/s1368980021003463,560
629528,COVID-19 Discourse on Twitter in Four Asian Countries: Case Study of Risk Communication,2021-03-16,"A lesser known but crucially important downstream effect of Rho family GTPases is the regulation of gene expression. This major role is mediated via the cytoskeleton, the organization of which dictates the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of a set of transcription factors. Central among these is myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF), which upon actin polymerization translocates to the nucleus and binds to its cognate partner, serum response factor (SRF). The MRTF/SRF complex then drives a large cohort of genes involved in cytoskeleton remodeling, contractility, extracellular matrix organization and many other processes. Accordingly, MRTF, activated by a variety of mechanical and chemical stimuli, affects a plethora of functions with physiological and pathological relevance. These include cell motility, development, metabolism and thus metastasis formation, inflammatory responses and—predominantly-organ fibrosis. The aim of this review is twofold: to provide an up-to-date summary about the basic biology and regulation of this versatile transcriptional coactivator; and to highlight its principal involvement in the pathobiology of kidney disease. Acting through both direct transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms, MRTF plays a key (yet not fully appreciated) role in the induction of a profibrotic epithelial phenotype (PEP) as well as in fibroblast-myofibroblast transition, prime pathomechanisms in chronic kidney disease and renal fibrosis.","Miranda, Maria Zena; Lichner, Zsuzsanna; Szászi, Katalin; Kapus, András",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34204945/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22116040,560

630728,"Healthcare workers’ behaviors on infection prevention and control and their determinants during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study based on the theoretical domains framework in Wuhan, China",2021-06-30,"Background In hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, progression to acute respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Severe dysregulated systemic inflammation is the putative mechanism. We hypothesize that early prolonged methylprednisolone (MP) treatment could accelerate disease resolution, decreasing the need for ICU and mortality. Methods We conducted a multicenter, observational study to explore the association between exposure to prolonged, low-dose, MP treatment and need for ICU referral, intubation or death within 28 days (composite primary endpoint) in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Italian respiratory high-dependency units. Secondary outcomes were invasive MV-free days and changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Results Findings are reported as MP (n=83) vs. control (n=90). The composite primary endpoint was met by 19 vs. 40 [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.24-0.72]. Transfer to ICU and need for invasive MV was necessary in 15 vs. 27 (p=0.07) and 14 vs. 26 (p=0.10), respectively. By day 28, the MP group had fewer deaths (6 vs. 21, adjusted HR=0.29; 95% CI: 0.12-0.73) and more days off invasive MV (24.0 plus-or-minus sign 9.0 vs. 17.5 plus-or-minus sign 12.8; p=0.001). Study treatment was associated with rapid improvement in PaO2:FiO2 and CRP levels. The complication rate was similar for the two groups (p=0.84). Conclusion In patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, early administration of prolonged MP treatment was associated with a significantly lower hazard of death (71%) and decreased ventilator dependence. Randomized controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings.","Salton, F.; Confalonieri, P.; Santus, P.; Harari, S.; Scala, R.; Lanini, S.; Vertui, V.; Oggionni, T.; Caminati, A.; Patruno, V.; Tamburrini, M.; Scartabellati, A.; Parati, M.; Villani, M.; Radovanovic, D.; Tomassetti, S.; Ravaglia, C.; Poletti, V.; Vianello, A.; Gaccione, A.

The current report summarizes the challenges and solutions of the transition from an in-person (ie, face-to-face) to a videoconference intervention delivery approach in response to the Coronavirus Disease pandemic. METHOD: Participants included patient-family caregiver dyads who were enrolled in ongoing yoga trials and 2 certified yoga therapists who delivered the yoga sessions. We summarized their experiences using recordings of the yoga sessions and interventionists’ progress notes. RESULTS: Out of 7 dyads participating in the parent trial, 1 declined the videoconferenced sessions. Participants were between the ages of 55 and 76 and mostly non-Hispanic White (83%). Patients were mainly male (83%), all had stage III or IV cancer and were undergoing radiotherapy. Caregivers were all female. Despite challenges in the areas of technology, location, and setting, instruction and personal connection, the overall acceptability was high among patients, caregivers, and instructors. Through this transition process, solutions to these challenges were found, which are described here. CONCLUSION: Although in-person interventions are favored by both the study participants and the interventionists, videoconference sessions were deemed acceptable. All participants had the benefit of a previous in-person experience, which was helpful and perhaps necessary for older and advanced cancer patients requiring practice modifications. In a remote setting, the assistance of caregivers seems particularly beneficial to ensure practice safety.

Therefore tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptors, became considered as a possible therapeutic option. Methods Patients were selected from the SARSTer national database, which included 2332 individuals with COVID-19 and the current study included 825 adult patients with moderate to severe course. The retrospective analysis was performed in 170 patients treated with TCZ and 655 without this medication or any other anti-cytokine therapy. The end-points of treatment effectiveness were a rate of death, need for mechanical ventilation, and clinical improvement. Results Patients treated with TCZ were balanced compared to non-TCZ regarding gender, age, BMI, and prevalence of coexisting conditions. The reduced death rate was demonstrated in patients treated with TCZ and baseline IL-6 >100 pg/ml (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.10-0.78), or those needing oxygen supplementations who worsened within 7 days of hospitalization (HR: 0.38, 95% CI:0.16-0.88). The best effectiveness of TCZ was achieved in patients with a combination of baseline IL-6>100 pg/ml and either SpO2[≤]90% (HR for death, mechanical ventilation, and clinical improvement after 21 or 28 days: 0.07, 0.14, 5.53, 5.18 respectively) or requiring oxygen supplementation (HR for death and clinical improvement after 21 or 28 days, 0.18, 2.66, 2.85 respectively).

We propose a functional form of birth rate that depends on the number of individuals in the population and on the elapsed time, allowing us to model a contagion effect. Thus, we model the early stages of an epidemic. The number of individuals then becomes the infectious cases and the birth rate becomes the incidence rate. We obtain this way a process that depends on two competitive phenomena, infection and immunization. Variations in those rates allow us to monitor how effective the actions taken by government and health organizations are. From our model, three useful indicators for the epidemic evolution over time are obtained: the immunization rate, the infection/immunization ratio and the mean time between infections (MTBI). The proposed model allows either positive or negative concavities for the mean value curve, provided the infection/immunization ratio is either greater or less than one. We apply this model to the present SARS-CoV-2 pandemic still in its early growth stage in Latin American countries. As it is shown, the model accomplishes a good fit for the real number of both positive cases and deaths. We analyze the evolution of the three indicators for several countries and perform a comparative study between them.

Reliable estimates of cumulative incidence in the population are critical to tracking the extent of transmission and informing policies. METHODS: We conducted a statewide seroprevalence study among a 15,101 patron convenience sample at 99 grocery stores in 26 counties throughout NYS. SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence was estimated from antibody reactivity by first post-stratification weighting then adjusting by antibody test characteristics. The percent diagnosed was estimated by dividing diagnoses by estimated infection-experienced adults. RESULTS: Based on 1,887 of 15,101 reactive results (12.5%), estimated cumulative incidence through March 29 was 14.0% (95% CI: 13.3-14.7%), corresponding to 2,139,300 (95% CI: 2,035,800-2,242,800) infection-experienced adults. Cumulative incidence was highest in New York City (NYC) 22.7% (95% CI: 21.5-24.0%) and higher among Hispanic/Latino (29.2%), non-Hispanic black/African American (20.2%), and non-Hispanic Asian (12.4%) than non-Hispanic white adults (8.1%, p<.0001).

The framework was developed through regional training action workshops and field activities. The active involvement of national animal health services enabled the identification, collection and hierarchization of risk factors. Quantitative data were collected in the field, and expert knowledge was integrated to adjust the available data at regional level. Experts categorized and combined the risk factors into ordinal levels of risk per epidemiological unit to ease implementation of risk-based surveillance in the field. The framework was used to perform a qualitative assessment of the risk of introduction and spread of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Tunisia as part of a series of workshops held between 2015 and 2018. The experts in attendance combined risk factors such as epidemiological status, transboundary movements, proximity to the borders and accessibility to assess the risk of FMD outbreaks in Tunisia. Out of the 2,075 Tunisian imadas, 23 were at a very high risk of FMD introduction, mainly at the borders; and 59 were at a very high risk of FMD spread. To validate the model, the results were compared to the FMD outbreaks notified by Tunisia during the 2014 FMD epizootic. Using a spatial Poisson model, a significant alignment between the very high and high-risk categories of spread and the occurrence of FMD outbreaks was shown. The relative risk of FMD occurrence was thus 3.2 higher for imadas in the very high and high spread risk categories than for imadas in the low and negligible spread risk categories. Our results show that the qualitative risk assessment framework can be a useful decision support tool for risk-based disease surveillance and control, in particular in scarce-data environments.","Squarzoni-Diaw, Cécile; Arsevska, Elena; Kalthoum, Sana; Hammami, Pachka; Cherni, Jamel; Daoudi, Assia; Karim Laoufi, Mohamed; Lezaar, Yassir; Rachid, Kechna; Seck, Ismaila; Ould Elmamy, Bezeid; Yahya, Barry; Dufour, Barbara; Hendrikx, Pascal; Cardinale, Eric; Muñoz, Facundo; Lancelot, Renaud; Coste, Caroline",Transbound Emerg Dis,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33174371/,560

This population is also at risk from SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is important to understand the impact of coexistent hip fracture and SARS-CoV-2 for informed decision-making at patient and service levels. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies of older (> 60 years) people with fragility hip fractures and outcomes with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcome was early (30-day or in-hospital) mortality. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay and key clinical characteristics known to be associated with outcomes after hip fracture. RESULTS: A total of 14 cohort and five case series studies were included (692 SARS-CoV-2 positive, 2,585 SARS-CoV-2 negative). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an overall risk ratio (RR) for early mortality of 4.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.42 to 5.82). Early mortality was 34% (95% CI 30% to 38%) and 9% (95% CI 8% to 10%) in the infected and noninfected groups respectively. Length of stay was increased in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (mean difference (MD) 5.2 days (3.2 to 7.2)). Age (MD 1.6 years (0.3 to 2.9)); female sex (RR 0.83 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.05)); admission from home (RR 0.51 (95% CI 0.26 to 1.00)); presence of dementia (RR 1.13 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.43)); and intracapsular fracture (RR 0.89 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.11)) were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. There were statistically, but not clinically, significantly greater Nottingham Hip Fracture Scores in infected compared with non-infected patients (MD 0.7 (0.4 to 0.9)). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with worse outcomes after hip fracture. This is not explained by differences in patient characteristics. These data can be used to support informed decision-making and may help track the impact of widespread adoption of system-level and therapeutic changes in management of the COVID-19 pandemic.

From its initial uses in biological research to its current importance in the biopharmaceutical industry, many types of culture media were developed: from serum-based media to serum-free to protein-free chemically defined media. The cultivation of animal cells economically has become the ultimate goal in the field of biomanufacturing. Serum serves as a source of amino acids, lipids, proteins and most importantly growth factors and hormones, which are essential for many cell types. However, the use of serum is unfavorable due to its high price tag, increased lot-to-lot variations and potential risk of microbial contamination. Efforts are progressively being made to replace serum with recombinant proteins such as growth factors, cytokines and hormones, as well as supplementation with lipids, vitamins, trace elements and hydrolysates. While hydrolysates are more complex, they provide a diverse source of nutrients to animal cells, with potential beneficial effects beyond the nutritional value. In this review, we discuss the use of hydrolysates in animal cell culture and briefly cover the composition of hydrolysates, mode of action and potential contaminants with some perspectives on its potential role in animal cell culture media formulations in the future.","Ho, Yin Ying; Lu, Hao Kim; Lim, Zhi Feng Sherman; Lim, Hao Wei; Ho, Ying Swan; Ng, Say Kong",Bioresour Bioprocess,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40643-021-00443-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34603939/,560
638920,Why African Americans Are a Potential Target for COVID-19 Infection in the United States,2020-06-12,"Background: Pharmacists play a vital role in recommending and providing vaccines to improve public health and are on the front line of mass immunization efforts. Aim: The objective of this study is to evaluate pharmacists’ perceptions on COVID-19 vaccines prior to emergency use authorization (EUA) amid a global pandemic. Methods: A voluntary, anonymous, cross-sectional survey was conducted between September and November 2020. Survey respondents included a convenience sample of licensed pharmacists in the United States. The primary outcomes were pharmacists’ willingness to receive and recommend hypothetical COVID-19 vaccines. Covariates assessed in the survey included COVID-19 exposure or personal experience, primary pharmacy practice setting, background in training, geographic region, and prioritization of clinical data. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: This study surveyed 763 pharmacists and results from 632 participants were included in final analysis. Overall, 67.1% of the pharmacists were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and 63.4% of the pharmacists were willing to recommend a COVID-19 vaccine at ≤1 year from the time of vaccine approval. At >1 year after vaccine approval, 78% of the pharmacists were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and 81.2% of the pharmacists were willing to recommend a COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusions: Survey findings suggest that, while a majority of pharmacists surveyed indicate acceptance of hypothetical COVID-19 vaccines, there remains to be hesitancy among pharmacists to receive or recommend vaccination.","Jacob, Sonia Susan; Bridgeman, Mary Barna; Kim, Hyoeun; Toscani, Michael; Kohler, Racquel; Shiau, Stephanie; Jimenez, Humberto R.; Barone, Joseph A.; Narayanan, Navaneeth",Pharmacy (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34449708/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmacy9030131,560

A compound library consisting of 960 commercially available drugs and biologically active substances was screened for inhibition of SARS-CoV 3CL protease. Potent inhibition was achieved using the mercury-containing compounds thimerosal and phenylmercuric acetate, as well as hexachlorophene. As well, 1–10 μM of each compound inhibited viral replication in Vero E6 cell culture. Detailed mechanism studies using a fluorescence-based protease assay demonstrated that the three compounds acted as competitive inhibitors (K(i)=0.7, 2.4, and 13.7 μM for phenylmercuric acetate, thimerosal, and hexachlorophene, respectively). A panel of metal ions including Zn(2+) and its conjugates were then evaluated for their anti-3CL protease activities. Inhibition was more pronounced using a zinc-conjugated compound (1-hydroxypyridine-2-thione zinc; Ki=0.17 μM) than using the ion alone (Ki=1.1 μM).","Hsu, John T.-A.; Kuo, Chih-Jung; Hsieh, Hsing-Pang; Wang, Yeau-Ching; Huang, Kuo-Kuei; Lin, Coney P.-C.; Huang, Ping-Fang; Chen, Xin; Liang, Po-Huang",FEBS Lett,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014579304010087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15358550/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579304010087,560

We planned a study to evaluate improvement in clinical outcomes with remdesivir treatment for five days. METHODS: Participants more than 40-years old and with moderate to severe COVID-19 but not on mechanical ventilation were randomly assigned into two groups-remdesivir group (34 cases) to receive the study drug intravenous (IV) remdesivir for five days plus the standard care (SC) and non-remdesivir group (36 cases) to receive the SC but not to receive the study drug. Follow-up was continued for 12 days after the beginning of treatment or until discharge/death. Patient's clinical status was assessed by laboratory investigations and physical examination (from day 1 to day 12 on a 4-point ordinal scale and from day 12 to 24 on a 6-point ordinal scale). Oxygen support requirements and adverse events were recorded. The data were entered and analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.0. RESULTS: High-flow oxygen support and non-invasive ventilation was required at baseline by lesser patients in the remdesivir group. In the end, both groups had similar outcomes after adjustment for baseline clinical status. There was no statistical difference in mortality between the two groups (p = 0.749). Patients in both groups had an equal time to recovery. There was no difference in the occurrence of adverse effects of remdesivir between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Remdesivir therapy for five days did not produce improvement in clinical outcomes in moderate to severe COVID-19 cases.","Mahajan, Lakshmi; Singh, A P; Gifty,",Indian J Anaesth,https://doi.org/10.4103/ija.ija_149_21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33814589/,560

There is an urgent need to develop a safe and efficacious vaccine against RSV that would induce immunological memory without causing immunopathology following natural RSV infection. We have previously generated two recombinant live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) viruses that encode immunodominant T-cell epitopes of RSV M2 protein in the neuraminidase or NS1 genes. These chimeric vaccines afforded protection against influenza and RSV infection in mice, without causing pulmonary eosinophilia or inflammatory RSV disease. The current study assessed the formation of influenza-specific and RSV-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses in the lungs of mice, with special attention to the lung tissue-resident memory T cell subsets (T(RM)). The RSV epitopes did not affect influenza-specific CD4 effector memory T cell (Tem) levels in the lungs. The majority of these cells formed by LAIV or LAIV-RSV viruses had CD69(+)CD103(-) phenotype. Both LAIV+NA/RSV and LAIV+NS/RSV recombinant viruses induced significant levels of RSV M2(82) epitope-specific lung-localized CD8 Tem cells expressing both CD69 and CD103 T(RM) markers. Surprisingly, the CD69(+)CD103(+) influenza-specific CD8 Tem responses were augmented by the addition of RSV epitopes, possibly as a result of the local microenvironment formed by the RSV-specific memory T cells differentiating to T(RM) in the lungs of mice immunized with LAIV-RSV chimeric viruses. This study provides evidence that LAIV vector-based vaccination can induce robust lung-localized T-cell immunity to the inserted T-cell epitope of a foreign pathogen, without altering the immunogenicity of the viral vector itself.","Matyushenko, Victoria; Kotomina, Tatiana; Kudryavtsev, Igor; Mezhenskaya, Daria; Prokopenko, Polina; Matushkina, Anastasia; Sivak, Konstantin; Muzhikyan, Arman; Rudenko, Larisa; Isakova-Sivak, Irina",Antiviral Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104864; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32585323/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220302783?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354220302783,560

Therefore, a case-control study (103 COVID-19 patients and 105 controls) was performed to determine sHLA-G role in severity of COVID-19. Results revealed that median levels of sHLA-G were significantly increased in serum of patients compared to controls (19.3 vs. 12.7 ng/mL; p <0.001). When patients and controls were stratified by age group, gender, body mass index, chronic disease, or ABO and Rh blood groups, the sHLA-G level did not show a significant difference in each stratum. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the up-regulated expression of sHLA-G was associated with an elevated risk of developing COVID-19. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that sHLA-G was a very good predictor of COVID-19, and at a cut-off value of 15.4 ng/mL, the sensitivity and specificity of sHLA-G were 79.6 and 79.0%, respectively. Spearman rank correlation analysis revealed that sHLA-G was positively correlated with age, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white blood cell count, and random blood glucose, while a negative correlation was recorded with vitamin D.

644150,Guidelines for Frontline Health Care Staff Safety for COVID-19,2020-07-13,"Background: There has been a rapid increase in the number of cases of COVID19 in Latin America, Africa and Asia, in many countries that have an insufficient number of physicians and other health care personnel, and the need for the inclusion of medical students as part of the health teams is a very important issue. It has been recommended that medical students work as volunteers, have appropriate training, do not undertake any activity beyond their level of competence, have continuous supervision and adequate personal protective equipment. However, motivation of medical students must be evaluated in order to make volunteering a more evidence-based initiative. The aim of our study was to evaluate motivation of medical students to be part of the health team to help in the COVID19 pandemic. Methods and Findings: We developed a questionnaire specifically to evaluate medical students perceptions about participating in care of patients with suspected infection due to coronavirus during the COVID19 pandemic. The questionnaire had two parts: a) individual characteristics, year and geographic location of medical school; b) twenty eight statements responded on a 5 point Likert scale (totally agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree and totally disagree). To develop the questionnaire, we performed consensus meetings of a group of faculty and medical students. The questionnaire was sent to student organizations of 257 medical schools in Brazil and answered by 10,433 students. We used multinomial logistic regression models to analyse the data. Statements with greater odds ratios for participation of medical students in COVID19 pandemic were related to sense of purpose or duty (It is the duty of the medical student to put himself at the service of the population in the pandemic), altruism (I am willing to take risks by participating in practical in the context of pandemic), perception of good performance and professional identity (I will be a better health professional for having experienced the pandemic). Males had higher odds ratios than females (1.36 [95% CI: 1.24 to 1.49] to 1.68 [95% CI: 1.47 to 1.91]). Conclusions: Medical students are motivated by sense of purpose or duty, altruism, perception of good performance and values of professionalism more than their interest in learning. These results have implications in the developing of programs of volunteering and in the design of health force policies in the present pandemic and in future health emergencies.","Tempski, P.; Arantes-Costa, F.

As the number of telephone counselors is insufficient in Japan, public needs cannot be fully met. Willingness is important for securing telephone counselors, but few studies have examined the willingness to engage in telephone counseling activities. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between telephone counselors’ willingness to perform their activities and their psychological characteristics, health status, and received social support. In this study, a questionnaire survey was conducted by mail among telephone counselors belonging to the Federation of Inochi No Denwa in Japan. The total number of valid responses was 709 (recovery rate: 50.4%). Following an exploratory factor analysis, three factors were extracted: (1) willingness to engage in telephone counseling activities, (2) sense of being burdened by telephone counseling activities, and (3) sense of difficulty in coping. Structural equation modeling, using all the factors, showed that social support and grit were directly related to the willingness to engage in telephone counseling activities, while physical health, mental health, and general self-efficacy were indirectly related to it. The findings obtained may be useful in devising concrete measures for telephone counselors to continue their activities.","Murakami, Osamu; Kanda, Kanae; Ngatu, Nlandu Roger; Hirao, Tomohiro",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574721/,560

Most of the clinical trials excluded patients with hepatitis B (HBV), hepatis C (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) active infection (1–10). Despite the progress in treatment of these infections, they remain an unresolved clinical problem when lung cancer immunotherapy should be initiated in an NSCLC patient. This manuscript summarizes the data from the literature concerning this subgroup of patients including the rationale for immunotherapy initiation depending on the HBV, HCV, or HIV infection status; the risk of adverse events; and the efficacy compared to non-infected patients. One of the crucial questions is how the candidates to immunotherapy should be screened for HBV, HCV, and HIV infections. The year 2020 brought the world a new but dynamic viral problem—severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2). The incorporation of known data in oncology guidelines became a burning need, and then, which group of the infected patients can be treated with immunotherapy despite the infection. Oncologists should also know if these patients should receive antiviral therapy and what are the safe combinations in these settings. We also indicate which of the adverse events should be monitored carefully during checkpoint inhibitor treatment.","Kalinka, Ewa; Chmielewska, Izabela; Wojas-Krawczyk, Kamila",Front Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34434887/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.577514,560

Accumulating evidences suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes dysregulation of immune system. However, the unique signature of early immune responses remains elusive. We characterized the transcriptome of rhesus macaques and mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Alarmin S100A8 was robustly induced by SARS-CoV-2 in animal models as well as in COVID-19 patients. Paquinimod, a specific inhibitor of S100A8/A9, could reduce inflammatory response and rescue the pneumonia with substantial reduction of viral titers in SASR-CoV-2 infected animals. Remarkably, Paquinimod treatment resulted in 100% survival of mice in a lethal model of mouse coronavirus (MHV) infection. A novel group of neutrophils that contributed to the uncontrolled inflammation and onset of COVID-19 were dramatically induced by coronavirus infections. Paquinimod treatment could reduce these neutrophils and regain antiviral responses, unveiling key roles of S100A8/A9 and noncanonical neutrophils in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, highlighting new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.","Guo, Qirui; Zhao, Yingchi; Li, Junhong; Liu, Jiangning; Guo, Xuefei; Zhang, Zeming; Cao, Lili; Luo, Yujie; Bao, Linlin; Wang, Xiao; Wei, Xuemei; Deng, Wei; Chen, Luoying; Zhu, Hua; Gao, Ran; Qin, Chuan; Wang, Xiangxi; You, Fuping",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.09.288704,560

Though major symptoms are primarily generated from the respiratory system, neurological symptoms are being reported in some of the confirmed cases, raising concerns of its potential for intracranial invasion and neurological manifestations, both in the acute phase and in the long-term. At present, it remains unclear the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 is present in the brain, and if so, its pathogenic role in the central nervous system (CNS). Evidence for neuroinvasion and neurovirulence of hCoVs has been recognised in animal and human studies. Given that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same family and shares characteristics in terms of receptor binding properties, it is worthwhile exploring its potential CNS manifestations.

The recent literature concerning whole-cell biosensors is reviewed with an emphasis on mammalian cells, and the challenges and breakthroughs brought along in biomedical analyses through novel biosensing concepts and the synthetic biology toolbox. These recent innovations allow development of cell-based biosensing platforms having tailored performances and capable to reach the levels of sensitivity, dynamic range, and stability suitable for high analytic/medical relevance. They also pave the way for the construction of flexible biosensing platforms with utility across biological research and clinical applications.

647189,Impact of COVID-19 on the Mental Health of Healthcare Workers: A Cross-Sectional Study From Pakistan,2021-04-26,"To monitor airborne nano-sized particles (NPs), a single-chip differential mobility particle sizer (DMPS) based on resonant micro cantilevers in defined micro-fluidic channels (µFCs) is introduced. A size bin of the positive-charged fraction of particles herein is separated from the air stream by aligning their trajectories onto the cantilever under the action of a perpendicular electrostatic field of variable strength. We use previously described µFCs and piezoresistive micro cantilevers (PMCs) of 16 ng mass fabricated using micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) technology, which offer a limit of detection of captured particle mass of 0.26 pg and a minimum detectable particulate mass concentration in air of 0.75 µg/m(3). Mobility sizing in 4 bins of a nebulized carbon aerosol NPs is demonstrated based on finite element modelling (FEM) combined with a-priori knowledge of particle charge state. Good agreement of better than 14% of mass concentration is observed in a chamber test for the novel MEMS-DMPS vs. a simultaneously operated standard fast mobility particle sizer (FMPS) as reference instrument. Refreshing of polluted cantilevers is feasible without de-mounting the sensor chip from its package by multiply purging them alternately in acetone steam and clean air.","Bertke, Maik; Kirsch, Ina; Uhde, Erik; Peiner, Erwin",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34072041/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21113731,560

These complex poles are known as resonances and provide the energies and inverse lifetimes of the system under study (e.g., molecules) in metastable states. This approach allows incorporating finite grid methods in the study of resonance phenomena in chemistry. Possible applications include the calculation of electronic autoionization resonances which occur when ionization takes place as the bond lengths of the molecule are varied. Alternatively, the method can be applied to calculate nuclear predissociation resonances which are associated with activated complexes with finite lifetimes.","Dann, Roie; Elbaz, Guy; Berkheim, Jonathan; Muhafra, Alan; Nitecki, Omri; Wilczynski, Daniel; Moiseyev, Nimrod",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34500682/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26175248,560
647631,Commercial Off-The-Shelf Video Games for Reducing Stress and Anxiety: Systematic Review,2021-08-16,"Importance Population stratification of the adult population in Ontario, Canada by their risk of COVID-19 complications can support rapid pandemic response, resource allocation, and decision making. Objective To develop and validate a multivariable model to predict risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19 severity from routinely collected health records of the entire adult population of Ontario, Canada. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study included 36,323 adult patients (age >= 18 years) from the province of Ontario, Canada, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction between February 2 and October 5, 2020, and followed up through November 5, 2020. Patients living in long-term care facilities were excluded from the analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures Risk of hospitalization within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis was estimated via Gradient Boosting Decision Trees, and risk factor importance was examined via Shapley values. Results The study cohort included 36,323 patients with majority female sex (18,895 [52.02%]) and median (IQR) age of 45 (31-58) years. The cohort had a hospitalization rate of 7.11% (2,583 hospitalizations) with median (IQR) time to hospitalization of 1 (0-5) days, and a mortality rate of 2.49% (906 deaths) with median (IQR) time to death of 12 (6-27) days. In contrast to patients who were not hospitalized, those who were hospitalized had a higher median age (64 years vs 43 years, p-value < 0.001), majority male (56.25% vs 47.35%, p-value<0.001), and had a higher median [IQR] number of comorbidities (3 [2-6] vs 1 [0-3], p-value<0.001). Patients were randomly split into development (n=29,058, 80%) and held-out validation (n=7,265, 20%) cohorts. The final Gradient Boosting model was built using the XGBoost algorithm and achieved high discrimination (development cohort: mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve across the five folds of 0.852; held-out validation cohort: 0.8475) as well as excellent calibration (R2=0.998, slope=1.01, intercept=-0.01). The patients who scored at the top 10% in the validation cohort captured 47.41% of the actual hospitalizations, whereas those scored at the top 30% captured 80.56%. Patients in the held-out validation cohort (n=7,265) with a score of at least 0.5 (n=2,149, 29.58%) had a 20.29% hospitalization rate (positive predictive value 20.29%) compared with 2.2% hospitalization rate for those with a score less than 0.5 (n=5,116, 70.42%; negative predictive value 97.8%). Aside from age, gender and number of comorbidities, the features that most contribute to model predictions were: history of abnormal blood levels of creatinine, neutrophils and leukocytes, geography and chronic kidney disease. Conclusions A risk stratification model has been developed and validated using unique, de-identified, and linked routinely collected health administrative data available in Ontario, Canada. The final XGBoost model showed a high discrimination rate, with the potential utility to stratify patients at risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes. This model demonstrates that routinely collected health system data can be successfully leveraged as a proxy for the potential risk of severe COVID-19 complications. Specifically, past laboratory results and demographic factors provide a strong signal for identifying patients who are susceptible to complications. The model can support population risk stratification that informs patients protection most at risk for severe COVID-19 complications.","Gutierrez, J.

In a homeostatic view, LDs regulate the storage of neutral lipids, protein sequestration, removal of toxic lipids and cellular communication; however, recent advancements in the field show these organelles as essential for various cellular stress response mechanisms, including inflammation and immunity, with LDs acting as hubs that integrate metabolic and inflammatory processes. The accumulation of LDs has become a hallmark of infection, and is often thought to be virally driven; however, recent evidence is pointing to a role for the upregulation of LDs in the production of a successful immune response to viral infection. The fatty acids housed in LDs are also gaining interest due to the role that these lipid species play during viral infection, and their link to the synthesis of bioactive lipid mediators that have been found to have a very complex role in viral infection. This review explores the role of LDs and their subsequent lipid mediators during viral infections and poses a paradigm shift in thinking in the field, whereby LDs may play pivotal roles in protecting the host against viral infection.","Monson, Ebony A; Trenerry, Alice M; Laws, Jay L; Mackenzie, Jason M; Helbig, Karla J",FEMS Microbiol Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33512504/; https://doi.org/10.1093/femsre/fuaa066,560

650657,Information-Seeking Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic Across the United States: Longitudinal Analysis of Google Trends Data,2021-05-03,"BACKGROUND: There are several reports of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) use in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to guide clinical decision-making and future research. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane and Scopus databases from 1 December 2019 to 10 January 2021 for observational studies or randomised clinical trials examining ECMO in adults with COVID-19 ARDS. We performed random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression, assessed risk of bias using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist and rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Survival outcomes were presented as pooled proportions while continuous outcomes were presented as pooled means, both with corresponding 95% confidence intervals [CIs]. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were duration of ECMO therapy and mechanical ventilation, weaning rate from ECMO and complications during ECMO. RESULTS: We included twenty-two observational studies with 1896 patients in the meta-analysis. Venovenous ECMO was the predominant mode used (98.6%). The pooled in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients (22 studies, 1896 patients) supported with ECMO was 37.1% (95% CI 32.3–42.0%, high certainty). Pooled mortality in the venovenous ECMO group was 35.7% (95% CI 30.7–40.7%, high certainty). Meta-regression found that age and ECMO duration were associated with increased mortality. Duration of ECMO support (18 studies, 1844 patients) was 15.1 days (95% CI 13.4–18.7). Weaning from ECMO (17 studies, 1412 patients) was accomplished in 67.6% (95% CI 50.5–82.7%) of patients. There were a total of 1583 ECMO complications reported (18 studies, 1721 patients) and renal complications were the most common. CONCLUSION: The majority of patients received venovenous ECMO support for COVID-19-related ARDS. In-hospital mortality in patients receiving ECMO support for COVID-19 was 37.1% during the first year of the pandemic, similar to those with non-COVID-19-related ARDS. Increasing age was a risk factor for death. Venovenous ECMO appears to be an effective intervention in selected patients with COVID-19-related ARDS. PROSPERO CRD42020192627.

We identified those presymptomatic individuals at their time of departure from Wuhan and followed them until the development of symptoms. The renewal process was adopted by considering the incubation period as a renewal and the duration between departure and symptoms onset as a forward time. Such a method enhances the accuracy of estimation by reducing recall bias and using the readily available data. The estimated median incubation period was 7.76 days [95% confidence interval (CI): 7.02 to 8.53], and the 90th percentile was 14.28 days (95% CI: 13.64 to 14.90). By including the possibility that a small portion of patients may contract the disease on their way out of Wuhan, the estimated probability that the incubation period is longer than 14 days was between 5 and 10%.","Qin, Jing; You, Chong; Lin, Qiushi; Hu, Taojun; Yu, Shicheng; Zhou, Xiao-Hua",Sci Adv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32851189/; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abc1202,560
653234,Contamination of Air and Surfaces in Workplaces with SARS-CoV-2 Virus: A Systematic Review,2021-07-30,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound effects on the working lives of healthcare workers (HCWs), but the extent to which their well-being and mental health have been affected remains unclear. This longitudinal cohort study aims to recruit a cohort of National Health Service (NHS) HCWs, conducting surveys at regular intervals to provide evidence about the prevalence of symptoms of mental disorders, and investigate associated factors such as occupational contexts and support interventions available. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: All staff, students and volunteers working in the 18 participating NHS Trusts in England will be sent emails inviting them to complete a survey at baseline, with email invitations for the follow-up surveys sent 6 months and 12 months later. Opening in late April 2020, the baseline survey collects data on demographics, occupational/organisational factors, experiences of COVID-19, validated measures of symptoms of poor mental health (eg, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder), and constructs such as resilience and moral injury. These surveys will be complemented by in-depth psychiatric interviews with a sample of HCWs. Qualitative interviews will also be conducted, to gain deeper understanding of the support programmes used or desired by staff, and facilitators and barriers to accessing such programmes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for the study was granted by the Health Research Authority (reference: 20/HRA/210, IRAS: 282686) and local Trust Research and Development approval. Cohort data are collected via Qualtrics online survey software, pseudonymised and held on secure university servers. Participants are aware that they can withdraw from the study at any time, and there is signposting to support services if participants feel they need it. Only those consenting to be contacted about further research will be invited to participate in further components. Findings will be rapidly shared with NHS Trusts, and via academic publications in due course.","Lamb, Danielle; Greenberg, Neil; Hotopf, Matthew; Raine, Rosalind; Razavi, Reza; Bhundia, Rupa; Scott, Hannah; Carr, Ewan; Gafoor, Rafael; Bakolis, Ioannis; Hegarty, Siobhan; Souliou, Emilia; Rafferty, Anne Marie; Rhead, Rebecca; Weston, Danny; Gnangapragasam, Sam; Marlow, Sally; Wessely, Simon; Stevelink, Sharon",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34193505/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-051687,560
657610,Investigating the Association Between Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Symptom Subtypes and Health Anxiety as Impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study.,2021-08-20,"BACKGROUND: Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) is a genetic disorder that leads to frequent angioedema attacks in various parts of the body. In most cases it is caused by pathogenic variants in the SERPING1 gene, coding for C1-Inhibitor (C1-INH). The pathogenic variants in the gene result in reduced C1-INH levels and/or activity, which causes aberrant bradykinin production and enhanced vascular permeability. The standard-of-care diagnostic test is performed biochemically via measuring C1-INH level and activity as well as the C4 level. This, however, does not allow for the diagnosis of HAE types with normal C1-INH. There is an urgent need to identify and characterize HAE biomarkers for facilitating diagnostics and personalizing the treatment. The Hereditary Angioedema Kininogen Assay (HAEKA) study aims to measure the dynamics of cleaved High Molecular Weight Kininogen (HKa) and other metabolite levels during the angioedema and non-angioedema state of the disease. The metabolites will be analyzed and verified by liquid chromatography ion mobility high resolution mass spectrometry (LC/IM-QToF MS) of dried blood spot (DBS) cards upon the study completion. The study design is truly innovative: 100 enrolled participants provide blood samples via DBS: (1) every 3 months within 2 years during regular study site visits and (2) by at-home self-sampling during HAE attacks via finger pricking. We are presenting a project design that permits clinical study activities during pandemic contact restrictions and opens the door for other clinical studies during COVID-19. RESULTS: As of October 2020, there are 41 patients from 5 sites in Germany enrolled. 90 blood samples were collected during the regular visits, and 19 of the participants also performed self-sampling during the HAE attacks from which a total of 286 attack blood samples were collected. Participating patients rate the study procedures as easy to implement in their daily lives. The concept of home self-sampling is effective, reproducible, and convenient especially in times of contact restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: It is the hope that the HAEKA study will complete in 2023, reveal biomarker(s) for monitoring HAE disease activity, and may help to avoid HAE attacks via applying medication prior to the symptom onset.

The biggest challenge is to find an effective treatment and to reduce the need for hospitalisation. In the article, the patients with mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treated with doxycycline with significant improvement have been discussed. Doxycycline is a known antibiotic, but also an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory drug, so it seems to be ideal for the treatment of COVID-19. Doxycycline, as an easily available and low-cost medication, should be considered as a COVID-19 therapy in all patients in the first days of the symptoms of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Due to its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective and antiviral effects, it seems to be an ideal drug for patients with mild, moderate and severe disease.

To this date, most reports on the feasibility of this model refer to stable preterm infants admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs). Objectives: To scale up and adapt FICare to make it suitable in level IIIC NICUs, which care for extreme prematurity and other complex medical or surgical neonatal conditions. Materials and Methods: Step 1 was the creation of the FICare implementation team (FICare-IT) and baseline analysis of current procedures for critical care to identify needs, wishes, and requirements; we aimed for protocol elaboration tailored to our cultural, architectural, and clinical context (March 2017 to April 2018). Step 2 as a dissemination strategy by FICare-IT acting as primary trainers and mentors to ensure the education of 90% of nursing staff (May 2018 to July 2018). Step 3 involved piloting and evaluation with the aim to refine the procedure (July 2018 to December 2020). Results: A rigorous but flexible protocol was edited. The FICare educational manual included two curricula: for healthcare professionals/staff (Training the trainers) and for families (Education of caregivers), the latter being categorized in two intervention levels (basic and advanced), depending on the infant care needs and parent's decision. In total, 76 families and 91 infants (74.7% preterm; 18.7% complex surgery; 6.6% others) were enrolled in the pilot. No differences in acceptance rate (overall 86.4%) or in the number of infant-family dyads in the program per month were observed when considering the pre- and post-Covid-19 pandemic periods. All families, except for one who dropped out of the program, completed the agreed individualized training. Mothers spent more time in NICU than fathers (p < 0.05); uninterrupted time spent by mothers in NICU was longer during the pre-pandemic period (p < 0.01). Observed time to reach proficiency by task was within the expected time in 70% of the program contents. The parents revealed educational manuals, workshops, and cot-side teaching sessions as essential for their training, and 100% said they would accept entry into the FICare program again. Conclusions: The principles of the FICare model are suitable for all levels of care in NICUs. Leadership and continuous evaluation/refinement of implementation procedures are essential components to achieve the objectives.","Moreno-Sanz, Bárbara; Montes, María Teresa; Antón, Marta; Serrada, María Teresa; Cabrera, Marta; Pellicer, Adelina",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34178899/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.682097,560

661603,The Use of a Three-in-One Practice-Management-Innovation Training Model in the Construction of an Infection Control Team,2021-08-16,"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) was utilized to monitor SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage collected from manholes specific to individual student dormitories (dorms) at the University of Arizona in the fall semester of 2020, which led to successful identification and reduction of SARS-CoV-2 transmission events. Positive wastewater samples triggered clinical testing of residents within that dorm; thus, SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals were identified regardless of symptom expression. This current study examined clinical testing data to determine the abundance of asymptomatic versus symptomatic cases in these defined communities. Nasal and nasopharyngeal swab samples processed via antigen and PCR tests indicated that 79.2% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were asymptomatic, and only 20.8% of positive cases reported COVID-19 symptoms at the time of testing. Clinical data was paired with corresponding wastewater virus concentrations, which enabled calculation of viral shedding rates in feces per infected person. Mean shedding rates averaged from positive wastewater samples across all dorms were 7.30 ± 0.67 log10 genome copies per gram of feces (gc/g-feces) based on the N1 gene. Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 fecal shedding rates from infected individuals has been the critical missing component necessary for WBE models to measure and predict SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence in communities. The findings from this study can be utilized to create models that can be used to inform public health prevention and response actions.","Schmitz, Bradley W.; Innes, Gabriel K.; Prasek, Sarah M.; Betancourt, Walter Q.; Stark, Erika R.; Foster, Aidan R.; Abraham, Alison G.; Gerba, Charles P.; Pepper, Ian L.",Sci Total Environ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721048695; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34467933/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149794; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721048695?v=s5,560

In absence of protective buffers, prolonged exposure to excessive, early adversity can lead to poor health outcomes with significant impact lasting beyond the childhood years. Helping Us Grow Stronger (HUGS/Abrazos) is a community-based program, designed and launched at the time of the COVID-19 surge in the Spring of 2020, that combines emergency relief, patient navigation, and direct behavioral health support to foster family resilience and mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-related toxic stress on pregnant women and families with children under age 6. Through a targeted referral process, community health workers provide resource navigation for social needs, and a social worker provides behavioral health support. The use of innovative tools such as a centralized resource repository, community health workers with specialized knowledge in this age range, and a direct referral system seeks to assist in streamlining communication and ensuring delivery of quality care.

Everolimus has a significant impact on red blood cell parameters in patients with TSC. The most common alteration was microcytosis. The mean MCV value decreased by 9.2%, 12%, and 11.8% after 3, 6, and 12 months of everolimus treatment. The iron level declined during the first 3 months, and human soluble transferrin receptor concentration increased during 6 months of therapy. The size of K562 cells decreased when cultured in the presence of 5 μM everolimus by approximately 8%. The addition of hemin to the cell culture with 5 μM everolimus did not prevent any decrease in cell size. The stage of erythroid maturation did not affect the response to everolimus. Our results showed that the mTOR inhibitor everolimus caused red blood cell microcytosis in vivo and in vitro. This effect is not clearly related to a deficit of iron and erythroid maturation. This observation confirms that mTOR signaling plays a complex role in the control of cell size.","Jakubowska, Justyna; Pawlik, Bartłomiej; Wyka, Krystyna; Stolarska, Małgorzata; Kotulska, Katarzyna; Jóźwiak, Sergiusz; Młynarski, Wojciech; Trelińska, Joanna",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34202704/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22136802,560

We verified the feature with a plant-soil feedback pot experiment and then investigated the factors by comparing the properties of control soils that had not been previously used for growing ginseng (CS) with those of soils with a 10-year-crop-rotation cycle following the growth of AG (RS). It’s found that the survival rate of AG in RS was lower than that in CS. The RS had lower pH, available potassium content, and urease activity. Additionally, p-coumaric, p-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, caffeic, and cinnamic acid levels were lower in RS than in CS, but salicylic acid levels showed the opposite pattern. RS had higher Rhodanobacter and lower Acidothermus, Sphingomonas relative abundances in bacterial community. It’s also found that many bacteria were substantially correlated with phenolic acids and soil physiochemical properties. Results indicate that even after 10-year crop rotation, the negative effects of prior continuous cropping of AG has not been eliminated. The growth of AG can be affected negatively with deterioration of soil physicochemical properties and with lower levels of phenolic acids which promote pathogen reproduction.

666841,Associations between dental care approachability and dental attendance among women pregnant with an Indigenous child: a cross-sectional study,2021-09-17,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a highly pathogenic emergent virus which replicates in cells that can express ABH histo-blood group antigens. The heavily glycosylated SARS-CoV spike (S) protein binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 which serves as a cellular receptor. Epidemiological analysis of a hospital outbreak in Hong Kong revealed that blood group O was associated with a low risk of infection. In this study, we used a cellular model of adhesion to investigate whether natural antibodies of the ABO system could block the S protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 interaction. To this aim, a C-terminally EGFP-tagged S protein was expressed in chinese hamster ovary cells cotransfected with an α1,2-fucosyltransferase and an A-transferase in order to coexpress the S glycoprotein ectodomain and the A antigen at the cell surface. We observed that the S protein/angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-dependent adhesion of these cells to an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expressing cell line was specifically inhibited by either a monoclonal or human natural anti-A antibodies, indicating that these antibodies may block the interaction between the virus and its receptor, thereby providing protection. In order to more fully appreciate the potential effect of the ABO polymorphism on the epidemiology of SARS, we built a mathematical model of the virus transmission dynamics that takes into account the protective effect of ABO natural antibodies. The model indicated that the ABO polymorphism could contribute to substantially reduce the virus transmission, affecting both the number of infected individuals and the kinetics of the epidemic.","Guillon, Patrice; Clément, Monique; Sébille, Véronique; Rivain, Jean-Gérard; Chou, Chih-Fong; Ruvoën-Clouet, Nathalie; Le Pendu, Jacques",Glycobiology,https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwn093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18818423/,560

Many other arboviruses have since emerged from their sylvatic reservoirs and dispersed globally due to evolving factors that include anthropological behaviour, commercial transportation and land-remediation. Here, we outline some characteristics of these highly divergent arboviruses, including the variety of life cycles they have developed and the mechanisms by which they have adapted to evolving changes in habitat and host availability. We cite recent examples of virus emergence that exemplify how arboviruses have exploited the consequences of the modern human lifestyle. Using our current understanding of these viruses, we also attempt to demonstrate some of the limitations encountered in developing control strategies to reduce the impact of future emerging arbovirus diseases. Finally, we present recommendations for development by an international panel of experts reporting directly to World Health Organization, with the intention of providing internationally acceptable guidelines for improving emerging arbovirus disease control strategies. Success in these aims should alleviate the suffering and costs encountered during recent decades when arboviruses have emerged from their sylvatic environment.","Liang, Guodong; Gao, Xiaoyan; Gould, Ernest A",Emerg Microbes Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26038768/; https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2015.18,560

OBJECTIVES: To describe the characteristics and outcomes of children hospitalised with LRTIs at a tertiary paediatric hospital in South Africa and to investigate the role and impact of ACT in these children. METHOD: A retrospective folder review of children hospitalised with LRTI between January and June 2015 was conducted, extracting data on demographic characteristics, health condition, ACT interventions and patient outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1208 individual cases (median [IQR] age 7.6 (2.8–19.0) months), in 1440 hospitalisations, were included. The majority of children were hospitalised primarily for the management of bronchiolitis. Comorbidities were present in 52.6% of patients during at least one of their hospitalisations. Airway clearance therapy was administered in 5.9% (n = 85) of admissions, most commonly conventional (manual) ACT. Transient oxyhaemoglobin desaturation was reported in six children, and one child developed lobar collapse an hour post-treatment. No other adverse events were reported. The median (IQR) duration of hospitalisation was 2.3 (1.5–5.0) days, and the overall mortality rate was 0.7%. Children hospitalised for presumed nosocomial infections and pneumonia had the longest length of stay, were more likely to receive ACT and had the highest mortality rate. CONCLUSION: Airway clearance therapy was infrequently used in this population and was more commonly applied in those with nosocomial LRTI and pneumonia. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Although ACT was generally well tolerated, safety has not been ascertained, and oxygen saturation should be carefully monitored during therapy.","Corten, Lieselotte; Morrow, Brenda M.",S Afr J Physiother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32161827/; https://doi.org/10.4102/sajp.v76i1.1367,560

An ideal model should be good enough to output realistic clinical scenarios and respond to interventions done by trainees in real time. Use of simulation-based training has been tried in various fields of medicine. The aim of our study was to prospectively evaluate the effectiveness of simulation model “CRITICA”™ (MEDUPLAY systems) in training critical care physicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The advanced intensive care unit (ICU) simulator “CRITICA”™ (MEDUPLAY systems) was developed as a joint collaboration between the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru and St John’s Medical College, Bengaluru. Two-day workshop was conducted. Intensive didactic and case-based scenarios were simulated to formally teach principles of advanced ICU scenarios. The physicians were tested on clinical scenarios in hemodynamic monitoring and mechanical ventilation displayed on the simulator. Assessment of the analytical thinking and pattern recognition ability was carried out before and after the display of the scenarios. Pre- and posttest scores were collected. RESULTS: The postsimulation test scores were higher than pretest scores and were statistically significant in hemodynamic monitoring and mechanical ventilation module. [Hemodynamic monitoring pre- and posttest scores 4.41 (2.06) vs 5.23 (2.22) p < 0.001] [Mechanical ventilation pre- and posttest scores 4 (2–5.5) vs 7.5 (6.5–8.5) p < 0.001]. A greater increase in posttest scores was seen in the mechanical ventilation module as compared to hemodynamic module. There was no effect of specialty or designation of a trainee on difference in pre- and posttest scores. CONCLUSION: Simulator-based training in hemodynamic monitoring and mechanical ventilation was effective.

Large-scale monitoring for capturing the current epidemiological situation of COVID-19 in Japan would improve preparation for and prevention of a massive outbreak. METHODS: A chatbot-based healthcare system named COOPERA (COvid-19: Operation for Personalized Empowerment to Render smart prevention And care seeking) was developed using the LINE app to evaluate the current Japanese epidemiological situation. LINE users could participate in the system either though a QR code page in the prefectures’ websites or a banner at the top of the LINE app screen. COOPERA asked participants questions regarding personal information, preventive actions, and non-specific symptoms related to COVID-19 and their duration. We calculated daily cross correlation functions between the reported number of infected cases confirmed using polymerase chain reaction and the symptom-positive group captured by COOPERA. RESULTS: We analyzed 206,218 participants from three prefectures reported between March 5 and 30, 2020. The mean age of participants was 44.2 (standard deviation, 13.2) years. No symptoms were reported by 96.93% of participants, but there was a significantly positive correlation between the reported number of COVID-19 cases and self-reported fevers, suggesting that massive monitoring of fever might help to estimate the scale of the COVID-19 epidemic in real time. CONCLUSIONS: COOPERA is the first real-time system being used to monitor trends in COVID-19 in Japan and provides useful insights to assist political decisions to tackle the epidemic.","Yoneoka, Daisuke; Kawashima, Takayuki; Tanoue, Yuta; Nomura, Shuhei; Ejima, Keisuke; Shi, Shoi; Eguchi, Akifumi; Taniguchi, Toshibumi; Sakamoto, Haruka; Kunishima, Hiroyuki; Gilmour, Stuart; Nishiura, Hiroshi; Miyata, Hiroaki",J Epidemiol,https://doi.org/10.2188/jea.je20200150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32475884/,560
672633,Assessing the Real-Time Mental Health Challenges of COVID-19 in Individuals With Serious Mental Illnesses: Protocol for a Quantitative Study,2020-05-22,"Abstract SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus which caused the COVID-19 pandemic and infected more than 10 million victims and resulted in over 500,000 deaths in 213 countries around the world. Having no symptoms in the first week of infection increases the rate of spreading virus. This increasing rate and consequently increasing number of infected individuals necessitate an immediate development of proper diagnostic methods and effective treatments. To date, no specific treatment is detected for curing COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2, similar to other viruses, needs to interact with the host proteins to reach the host and replicate its genome. Accordingly, host-virus protein-protein interactions’ (PPI) identification could be useful in predicting the behavior of virus and designing antiviral drugs. Identification of host-virus PPIs with experimental approaches are so time consumable, and so computational approaches are usually applied. In this study, we developed a new method to predict SARS-CoV-2-human PPIs. Our model is a three-layer network in which the first layer contains the most similar Alphainfluenzavirus proteins to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The second layer contains protein-protein interactions between Alphainfluenzavirus proteins and human proteins. The third layer reveals protein-protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins by using the clustering coefficient network property on the two first layers. For further analysis on the results of our prediction network, we investigated human proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 proteins and report the most central human proteins in human PPI network. Moreover, differentially expressed genes of two available GSE were investigated and PPIs of SARS-CoV-2-human network, the human proteins of which were related to upregulated genes, were reported.","Khorsand, Babak; Savadi, Abdorreza; Naghibzadeh, Mahmoud",Informatics in medicine unlocked,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352914820305633; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2020.100413; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352914820305633?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32838020/,560

672714,Incidental finding of COVID-19 infection amongst staff at a primary care facility in Ghana,2020-10-09,"BACKGROUND: The need for home care workers (HCWs) is rapidly growing in Norway due to the increasingly growing elderly population. HCWs are exposed to a number of occupational hazards and physically demanding work tasks. Musculoskeletal disorders, stress, exhaustion, high sick leave rates and a high probability of being granted a disability pension are common challenges. This qualitative study explored the views of HCWs on how working conditions affect their safety, health, and wellbeing. METHODS: A descriptive and explorative design was utilised using semi-structured individual interviews with eight HCWs from three home care units in a middle-sized Norwegian city. Interviews were conducted in the Norwegian language, audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. The data was analysed by systematic text condensation. Key data quotes were translated into English by the authors. RESULTS: HCWs reported that meaningful work-related interactions and relationships contributed to their improved wellbeing. Challenging interactions, such as verbal violence by consumers, were deemed stressful. The unpredictable work conditions HCWs encounter in users’ homes contributed to their exposure to environmental hazards and unhealthy physical workloads. This was the case, although the employer promoted ergonomic work practices such as ergonomic body mechanics when mobilising and handling of clients, using safe patient handling equipment. HCWs perceived high level of individual responsibility for complying with company safety policies and practices, representing a health barrier for some. Organisational frameworks created unhealthy work conditions by shift work, time pressure and staffing challenges. Performing tasks in accordance with HCWs professional skills and identity was perceived as health-promoting. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that unpredictable working conditions at users’ home can adversely affect the safety, health, and wellbeing of HCWs. The interaction between the unpredictable environment at users’ homes, HCWs’ perceived high level of individual responsibility for complying with company safety policies and practices, and staffing challenges due to sickness-related absences upon the workplace creates tense work conditions with a negative influence on HCWs health.","Grasmo, Sunniva Grønoset; Liaset, Ingeborg Frostad; Redzovic, Skender Elez",BMC Health Serv Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06941-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34521407/,560

Government instructions to the general public include: (a) limiting time spent outside the home, (b) staying more than 1 m away from people outside the household at all times, and (c) maintaining hand hygiene. Current evidence suggests high rates of adherence to such instructions, but interventions to sustain adherence to government instructions in the long term can only be developed if we know why people do or do not adhere to them. The aims were to assess levels of public adherence to government instructions to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but more importantly to gauge why people were or were not adhering to instructions. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of 2252 adults who were representative of the UK population. Data were analysed descriptively, and using one-sample t-tests, within-participants ANOVA and multiple linear regression. RESULTS: The sample reported mostly adhering to UK government instructions to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, with 5% or fewer people reporting active resistance to instructions. People generally reported high levels of capability, opportunity and motivation to follow the instructions, but perceived relatively few physical and social opportunities. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that better adherence was associated with older age, being a woman, having a white ethnic background, and with perceiving greater levels of capabilities, opportunities and motivations. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions targeted at people with black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, men and younger people that focus on increasing capabilities, providing greater opportunities and boosting motivations are needed to support continued adherence to government instructions to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Further research is required to track changes in people’s capabilities, opportunities, motivations and behaviours in response to the ongoing emergency, any changes in government instructions, and to adapt the present procedures to other emergency situations.","Armitage, Christopher J.; Keyworth, Chris; Leather, Jessica Z.; Byrne-Davis, Lucie; Epton, Tracy",BMC Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10574-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33731056/,560

The RCA was absent, with no vessel leaving the right or non-coronary sinus. The LAD and LCx emerged from the left coronary sinus, with a “double-barrel” appearance. The LAD was unremarkable, with small, non-stenosed calcified plaque. The LCx had a 3 mm diameter, arching downward in the left atrioventricular groove, passing through the crux cordis, continuing into the right atrioventricular groove, and ending as a left acute artery and sinonodal artery.

In this study, the dynamics of COVID-19 for India and a few selected states with different demographic structures have been analyzed using a SEIRD epidemiological model. A systematic estimation of the basic reproductive ratio R0 is made for India and for each of the selected states. The study has analysed and predicted the dynamics of the temporal progression of the disease in Indian and the selected eight states: Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh. For India, the most optimistic scenario with respect to duration of the epidemic shows, the peak of infection will appear before mid September with the estimated R0=1.917, from the SEIRD model. Further, we show, a Gaussian fit of the daily incidences also indicates the peak will appear around middle of August this year. Our analyses suggest, the earliest dates when the epidemic will start to decline in most states are between Jun-August. For India, the number of infected people at the time of peak will be around 1.6 million including asymptomatic people. If the community transmission is prohibited, then the epidemic will infect not more than 3.1 million people in India.

The primary objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention 14 days after implementation. DESIGN: Quasi-experimental, segmented regression analysis. INTERVENTION: A series of outbreak measures classified into 4 categories: case and contact management, proactive case detection, rigorous infection control practices and resource prioritization and stewardship. METHODS: A mixed-effects segmented Poisson regression model was fitted to the incidence rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), calculated every 2 days, within each facility and case type (staff vs residents). For each facility, the outbreak time period was segmented into an early outbreak period (within 14 days of the intervention) and postintervention period (beyond 14 days following the intervention). Model outputs quantified COVID-19 incidence trend and rate changes between these 2 periods. A secondary model was constructed to identify effect modification by case type. RESULTS: The significant upward trend in COVID-19 incidence rate during the early outbreak period (rate ratio [RR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03–1.11; P < .001) reversed during the postintervention period (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.67–0.80; P < .001). The average trend did not differ by case type during the early outbreak period (P > .05) or the postintervention period (P > .05). However, staff had a 70% larger decrease in the average rate of COVID-19 during the postintervention period than residents (RR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.10–0.88; P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence for the effectiveness of this intervention to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 in LTCFs.

Specific risk groups were defined for increased risk of mortality and morbidity in COVID‐19, and renal transplant recipients are at a significantly increased risk regarding outcomes due to their immunosuppressed conditions. This study evaluated the general characteristics of kidney transplant recipients with COVID‐19 infection. Among 1257 transplant cases, 56 had COVID‐19 infection, and 23 (41%) were hospitalized during the 9‐month study period. Among all COVID‐19 cases, 58% were male with a mean age of 45.5 (±13.2, 19–71) years, and the most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (70.9%) and diabetes (23.6%). Hospitalized patients were older (p = 0.03) and had higher rates of hypertension (p = 0.008), diabetes (p = 0.002), and ischemic heart disease (p = 0.03). Therapeutic management included antimetabolite withdrawal and prednisolone increase in 71%, calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal in 8% and decrease in 58%, hydroxychloroquine in 17%, tocilizumab in 3%, and antivirals in 67% of patients. Acute kidney injury and respiratory failure developed in 34% and 85%, respectively. The mortality rate was 23%.

The disease is endemic in many regions, such as Africa, Asia, Eastern and Southern Europe, and Central Asia. Recently, the incidence of CCHF has increased rapidly in the countries of the World Health Organization Eastern Mediterranean Region (WHO EMR), with sporadic human cases and outbreaks of CCHF being reported from a number of countries in the region. Despite the rapidly growing incidence of the disease, there are currently no accurate data on the burden of the disease in the region due to the different surveillance systems used for CCHF in these countries. In an effort to increase our understanding of the epidemiology and risk factors for the transmission of the CCHF virus (CCHFV; a Nairovirus of the family Bunyaviridae) in the WHO EMR, and to identify the current knowledge gaps that are hindering effective control interventions, a sub-regional meeting was organized in Muscat, Oman, from December 7 to 9, 2015. This article summarizes the current knowledge of the disease in the region, identifies the knowledge gaps that present challenges for the prevention and control of CCHFV, and details a strategic framework for research and development activities that would be necessary to curb the ongoing and new threats posed by CCHFV.","Al-Abri, Seif S.; Abaidani, Idris Al; Fazlalipour, Mehdi; Mostafavi, Ehsan; Leblebicioglu, Hakan; Pshenichnaya, Natalia; Memish, Ziad A.; Hewson, Roger; Petersen, Eskild; Mala, Peter; Nhu Nguyen, Tran Minh; Rahman Malik, Mamunur; Formenty, Pierre; Jeffries, Rosanna",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971217300656; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2017.02.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28259724/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971217300656,560

METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all children <2 years old diagnosed with bronchiolitis at the University Medical Centre Ljubljana between May 2014 and April 2015, who were treated as outpatients (paediatric emergency department, PED group) or as inpatients in the standard hospital setting (WARD group) or in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU group). Detection of respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal swab was accomplished by RT‐PCR. Severity was assessed by Wang Respiratory Score and hospitalization longer than 24 hours. RESULTS: The study included 761 children. The three most frequently detected viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (hRV) and human bocavirus (hBoV) (57.5%, 272/473; 25.6%, 121/473; 18.4%, 87/473). Patient groups differed in Wang Respiratory Score for the severity of bronchiolitis (P < 0.001). No differences regarding the causative viruses were found. There was a lower proportion of children with the presence of more than one virus in PICU group compared to other two groups (P = 0.017). The three groups significantly differed in age, birthweight, comorbidities, bronchodilator treatment and antibiotic usage. However, multiple regression analysis revealed that younger age and the use of antibiotics were associated with bronchiolitis severity defined as hospitalization for >24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory syncytial virus, hRV and hBoV were the most frequently detected viruses. The majority of patients admitted to the PICU had only one virus detected. Younger age and the use of antibiotics were associated with bronchiolitis severity.","Praznik, Ajda; Vinšek, Neža; Prodan, Ana; Erčulj, Vanja; Pokorn, Marko; Mrvič, Tatjana; Paro, Darja; Krivec, Uroš; Strle, Franc; Petrovec, Miroslav; Žnidaršič Eržen, Marta; Grosek, Štefan",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12587; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29944781/,560

Officially, from 8 January 2020 e-prescribing has been obligated in Poland. Physicians’ and pharmacists’ opinions on e-prescribing have been widely researched and reported in the literature. In contrast, patients’ perception has, to date, received little attention. For this reason, the aim of this study was to find the features and functionalities of e-prescribing that are desired by the public and influence the positive evaluation of this tool, according to patient opinion. In order to obtain data, a questionnaire was completed by 456 randomly selected adults. The obtained results indicated that only eight people (1.8%) did not know what e-prescription is. Of the remaining 448 individuals, 72.1% prefer e-prescription because it is more convenient for them. Most patients (62.1%) also recognize that e-prescribing makes it easier to purchase medications on behalf of another patient. Based on the study, it can be concluded that e-prescription is well evaluated by Polish patients. A large percentage of respondents were positive about obtaining prescriptions for continued treatment, without a personal doctor visit. Therefore, it is reasonable to maintain the possibility of such contact with a physician. The most popular, and preferred, method of receiving e-prescriptions is via SMS. However, it is necessary to offer different options for obtaining prescriptions, to meet the needs of different populations.","Wrzosek, Natalia; Zimmermann, Agnieszka; Balwicki, Łukasz",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189769; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574688/,560

Investment and investigation in health also involve inequalities at the global level, and this includes insufficient North-South transfer of funds, technology and expertise in the health field, including the specific area of communicable diseases. Globally, epidemics and outbreaks in any geographic region can represent international public health emergencies, and this type of threat requires a global response. Therefore, given the need to strengthen the global capacity for dealing with threats of infectious diseases, a framework is needed for collaboration on alerting the world to epidemics and responding to public health emergencies. This is necessary to guarantee a high level of security against the dissemination of communicable diseases in an ever more globalized world. In response to these needs, international health agencies have put a number of strategies into practice in order to contribute to the control of communicable diseases in poor countries. The principle strategies include: 1) implementation of mechanisms for international epidemiologic surveillance; 2) use of international law to support the control of communicable diseases; 3) international cooperation on health matters; 4) strategies to strengthen primary care services and health systems in general; 5) promotion of the transfer of resources for research and development from the North to the South.","Lazcano-Ponce, Eduardo; Allen, Betania; González, Carlos Conde",Arch Med Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16216655/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S018844090500278X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S018844090500278X,560

In this review, we highlight the strategies to avoid an adrenal crisis in patients with AI and COVID-19. Adrenal crisis is a medical emergency and an important cause of death. Once patients with AI present symptoms of COVID-19, the dose of GC replacement therapy should be immediately doubled. In the presence of any emergency warning signs or inability to administer oral GC doses, we recommend that patients should immediately seek Emergency services to evaluate COVID-19 symptoms and receive 100 mg hydrocortisone by intravenous injection, followed by 50 mg hydrocortisone intravenously every 6 h or 200 mg/day by continuous intravenous infusion.","Almeida, Madson Q.; Mendonca, Berenice B.",Clinics (Sao Paulo),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32555949/; https://doi.org/10.6061/clinics/2020/e2022,560

A Synthesis of Alternative “Wash” Methods in the Absence of Water and Sanitizers in the Prevention of Coronavirus in Low-Resource Settings,2020-06-24,"Rationale: The clinical data and corresponding dynamic CT findings were investigated in detail to describe the clinical and imaging profiles of COVID-19 pneumonia disease progression. Methods: Forty HCWs with COVID-19 were included in this study and 30 enrolled for imaging assessment. Disease was divided into four stages based on time from onset: stage 1 (1-6 days), stage 2 (7-13 days), stage 3 (14-22 days), and stage 4 (> 22 days). Clinical wand imaging data were analyzed retrospectively. Results: The cohort included 33 female and 7 male cases, with a median age of 40 years. Six had underlying comorbidities. More than half of the cases were nurses (22, 55%). Each stage included 39, 37, 34 and 32 CTs, respectively. Bilateral lesions, multifocal lesions and lesions with GGO pattern occurred in both lower lobes at all stages. The crazy-paving pattern (20, 54%), air bronchogram (13, 35%), and pleural effusion (2, 5%) were the most common CT features in stage 2. Consolidation score peaked in stage 2 whereas total lesions score peaked in stage 3. Conclusions: COVID-19 pneumonia in HCWs has a potential predilection for younger female workers. Stage 2 of COVID-19 pneumonia may be the key period for controlling progression of the disease, and consolidation scores may be an objective reflection of the severity of lung involvement.","Liu, Huaping; Luo, Shiyong; Li, Hailan; Zhang, Youming; Huang, Chiyao; Li, Xili; Tan, Yiqing; Chen, Mingna",Int J Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.7150/ijms.48696; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33162792/,560

However, the situation becomes worse if the patient has coexisting morbidities or newly developed complications. The study is about managing rectus sheath haematoma (RSH) in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia. PRESENTATION OF CASE: The patient was a 75-year-old male, presenting with bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia, with pulmonary embolism complications. Therapeutic anticoagulation by subcutaneous Clexane injection was administered. A left rectus haematoma was observed, and the patient fell and underwent haemorrhagic shock. Laparotomy was done for the evacuation of the haematoma. DISCUSSION: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is an essential tool for diagnosing RSH, identifying the source of bleeding, type of haematoma, and compression of the urinary system. CONCLUSION: Surgical management of RSH in COVID-19 patients is superior to interventional radiology during the rush pandemic period.","Bakirov, Ifrat; Bakirova, Gultakin; Albalawi, Yousef; Asiri, Ayed Y.; Faqihi, Fahad; Bakirli, Ilkin; Hammami, Dema; Bakirli, Hasan; Mandow, Najmeddin M.",Int J Surg Case Rep,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210261220308713; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33042768/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2020.09.198; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210261220308713,560

They cause respiratory illnesses of varying severity and have been described to be continuously emerging but their prevalence is not well documented in Uganda. This study assessed the seroprevalence of antibodies against the previously known human coronaviruses prior 2019 in Uganda. METHODS: A total 377 serum samples collected from volunteers that showed influenza like illness in five hospital-based sentinel sites and archived were analyzed using a commercial Qualitative Human Coronavirus Antibody IgG ELISA kit. Although there is no single kit available that can detect the presence of all the circulating coronaviruses, this kit uses a nucleoprotein, aa 340–390 to coat the wells and since there is significant homology among the various human coronavirus strains with regards to the coded for proteins, there is significant cross reactivity beyond HCoV HKU-39849 2003. This gives the kit a qualitative ability to detect the presence of human coronavirus antibodies in a sample. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence for all the sites was 87.53% with no significant difference in the seroprevalence between the Hospital based sentinel sites (p = 0.8). Of the seropositive, the age group 1–5 years had the highest percentage (46.97), followed by 6–10 years (16.67) and then above 20 (16.36). An odds ratio of 1.6 (CI 0.863–2.97, p = 0.136) showed that those volunteers below 5 years of age were more likely to be seropositive compared to those above 5 years. The seropositivity was generally high throughout the year with highest being recorded in March and the lowest in February and December. CONCLUSIONS: The seroprevalence of Human coronaviruses is alarmingly high which calls for need to identify and characterize the circulating coronavirus strains so as to guide policy on the control strategies.","Mulabbi, Elijah Nicholas; Tweyongyere, Robert; Wabwire-Mangen, Fred; Mworozi, Edison; Koehlerb, Jeff; Kibuuka, Hannah; Millard, Monica; Erima, Bernard; Tugume, Titus; Aquino, Ukuli Qouilazoni; Byarugaba, Denis K.",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34134656/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-021-06258-6,560

However, long‐term reliance on this mode of teaching raises the prospect that transferring the whole of the learning environment to an impersonal digital world will lead to loss of anatomy’s humanistic side. In looking to a future increasingly dependent upon digital input to teaching, a number of roadblocks are identified. These are: the peril of abandoning the ethos of anatomy; for the workload of staff and especially for female academic staff; by a lack of adequate resources; to the research nature of departments, including the quality of research; to the position of anatomy in the biomedical sciences; and from pressures to retreat from a dissection‐based education. In tracing a future trajectory for anatomy, issues outlined are the inevitability of change, the need for anatomy to market itself to the world, and the opportunities presented for anatomy to view itself increasingly as a contributor to broad scholastic endeavors. Suggestions include exploring the possibilities presented by virtual anatomy museums, the use of online learning to reach those not normally in touch with anatomy teaching, and exploring the integrated courses with humanities disciplines. It is concluded that anatomy will flourish if there is a willingness to expand the traditional horizons and be prepared to integrate all that is best in the person‐to‐person and digital worlds.","Jones, David Gareth",Anat Sci Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33463041/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ase.2054,560

684892,Does pulmonary subspecialty referral from primary care affect the adherence to vaccination recommendations in COPD patients?,2021-02-12,"A series of epidemiological explorations have suggested a negative association between national BCG vaccination policy and the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19. Nevertheless, these comparisons are difficult to validate due to broad differences between countries such as socioeconomic status, demographic structure, rural vs. urban settings, time of arrival of the pandemic, number of diagnostic tests and criteria for testing, and national control strategies to limit the spread of COVID-19. We review evidence for the potential biological basis of BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19 and refine the epidemiological analysis to mitigate effects of potentially confounding factors (e.g., stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, development, rurality, population density and age structure). Results fail to confirm the null hypothesis of no-association between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 mortality, and suggest that BCG could have a protective effect. Nevertheless, the analyses are restricted to coarse-scale signals and should be considered with caution. BCG vaccination clinical trials are required to corroborate the patterns detected here and to establish causality between BCG vaccination and protection from severe COVID-19.

Health systems have been affected in such a way that patients with diseases other than COVID-19 have suffered serious consequences. In Latin America, the disease has emerged in a fragile system with more disparities, making our patients more vulnerable. Acute leukemia patients have a high risk of severe COVID-19 disease. Various expert recommendations have emerged with the aim of minimizing the risk of COVID-19 without affecting leukemia-related outcomes. However, multiple logistical issues tangentially associated with the pandemic have also appeared, potentially limiting the quality of management of these patients. The objective of this study was to register treatment modifications associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and its short-term consequences in Latin American countries. Methods We included patients older than 14 years, from 14 centers of 4 Latin American countries (Mexico, Peru, Guatemala and Panama), with the diagnosis of acute leukemia, who were on active treatment since the first case of COVID-19 was documented in each country. We documented their baseline characteristics and followed the patients prospectively until July 15, were data-cutoff for this pre-planned analysis was performed. The primary outcome was the incidence of COVID-19 disease and its complications. Secondary outcomes included treatment and consult modifications, and cause of death during the study period. Logistic regression was performed to determine factors associated with COVID-19 and all-cause mortality. Results We recorded the information of 635 patients: 58.1% Ph-negative ALL, 25.7% AML, 9% APL and 7.2% Ph+ALL. The median age was 35 years (14-90 years); 58.8% were consideredf high-risk patients. The majority were on CR (68.3%) receiving consolidation or maintenance therapy, while 14.5% were newly diagnosed and 17.2% with relapsed/refractory disease. The majority (91.8%) were treated in centers that were also receiving COVID-19 patients, 40.2% in centers were patients could not be electively hospitalized for leukemia treatment because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-pandemic led to treatment-modifications in 40.8% of the cases. Reasons for modifications were associated with logistical issues (22.4%), medical decisions (15.1%) or patient choice (3.3%). The most frequent modification was chemotherapy delay (17.3%) followed by regimen modification (13.4%) and dose-reductions (10.1%). (Figure 1) 83 patients (13.1%) developed COVID-19 disease, the majority mild-moderate disease (54.2%), 27.7% severe disease and 18.1% critically ill; 27.7% required mechanical ventilation and 37.7% died from COVID-19 disease, representing 4.9% of the entire cohort. We identify as risk factors for COVID-19 disease the presence of active leukemia (newly diagnosed or relapsed) (OR 3.46 [95% CI: 2.16-5.5], p<0.001), high-risk leukemia (OR 1.63 [95% CI: 1.54-4.52], p<0.001) and being treated in a center were elective hospitalization was possible (OR 2.17 [95% CI 1.29-3.67], p=0.004). Treatment modifications, appointment prolongations or the use of virtual consultation were not associated with a reduction in the risk of COVID-19. On the other hand, 16.7% of patients died during period analyzed due to leukemia (57.5%), COVID-19 (29.2%) or treatment related-mortality (13.2%). Independent factors associated with mortality were AML vs. ALL (OR 1.89 [95% CI: 1.12-3.18], p=0.016), relapsed-refractory disease (OR 8.34 [95% CI: 4.83-14.41], p<0.001), induction/consolidation vs. maintenance therapy (OR 2.20 [95% CI: 1.25-3.18], p<0.001) and the use of virtual consultation (OR 0.35 [95% CI: 0.13-0.94] p=0.037). (Table 1) Discussion/Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic led to significant modifications in the standard of care treatment of patients with acute leukemia. The incidence of COVID-19 disease in acute leukemia patients was considerable and more than a third of the patients with acute leukemia and COVID-19 disease died. Despite a short-follow up, 16.7% of the patients died and leukemia-related deaths were the most frequent. In low- and middle-income countries with fragile health systems, the collateral damage for patients with acute leukemia may be just as important as the direct consequences of COVID-19.

686117,Settings of virus exposure and their implications in the propagation of transmission networks in a COVID-19 outbreak,2020-11-30,"BACKGROUND: Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for patients with chronic respiratory conditions, but uptake is suboptimal. We undertook a comprehensive mixed methods study in order to examine the barriers and enablers to influenza vaccination in patients with chronic respiratory conditions. METHODS: Mixed methods including a survey (n = 429) which assessed sociodemographics and the psychological factors associated with vaccine uptake (ie confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation and collective responsibility) with binary logistic regression analysis. We also undertook focus groups and interviews (n = 59) to further explore barriers and enablers to uptake using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The survey analysis identified that older participants were more likely to accept the vaccine, as were those with higher perceptions of collective responsibility around vaccination, lower levels of complacency and lower levels of constraints. Thematic analysis showed that concerns over vaccine side effects, lack of tailored information and knowledge, and a lack of trust and rapport with healthcare professionals were key barriers. In contrast, the importance of feeling protected, acceptance of being part of an at‐risk group and feeling a reduced sense of vulnerability after vaccination were seen as key enablers. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that the decision to accept a vaccine against influenza is influenced by multiple sociodemographic and psychological factors.

Interactions between patients and their healthcare providers have a particularly important role to play in helping patients address their concerns and feel confident in vaccination.","Williams, Lynn; Deakin, Karen; Gallant, Allyson; Rasmussen, Susan; Young, David; Cogan, Nicola",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33773079/,560
686153,COVID-19 Vaccine in Veterans with Multiple Sclerosis: Protect the Vulnerable.,2021-04-01,"The behavioral health toll of the COVID-19 pandemic and systemic racism has directed increased attention to the potential of digital health as a way of improving access to and quality of behavioral health care. However, as the pandemic continues to widen health disparities in racially and ethnically minoritized groups, concerns arise around an increased reliance on digital health technologies exacerbating the digital divide and reinforcing rather than mitigating systemic health inequities in communities of color. As funding for digital mental health continues to surge, we offer five key recommendations on how the field can “REACT” to ensure the development of approaches that increase health equity by increasing real-world evidence, educating consumers and providers, utilizing adaptive interventions to optimize care, creating for diverse populations, and building trust. Recommendations highlight the need to take a strengths-based view when designing for racially and ethnically diverse populations and embracing the potential of digital approaches to address complex challenges.","Friis-Healy, Elsa A; Nagy, Gabriela A; Kollins, Scott H",JMIR Ment Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33406050/; https://doi.org/10.2196/25456,560

An integrated travel-decision risk typology with survey data from 835 potential tourists is developed and tested. Specifically, this paper explores the interplay of risk types, tourist attributes and destination characteristics. It examines if travel risks linked to nature, health, terrorism, criminality, political instability are more salient for tourists' destination choice, and how risk perceptions influence tourists in the key stages of the decision-making process. Results offer an important baseline for future studies in the post-COVID-19 phase. First, the integrated travel-decision risk typology distinguishes between sociodemographic, psychological and travel-related factors. It shows that past travel experience shapes risk perceptions and impacts tourists’ future destination choice. Second, the study reveals that natural hazards are not the key barrier in the early decision-making stage of the destination choice process. Third, tourist segments that are resilient to certain risks are identified. This paper concludes with implications for the tourism practice with recommendations on how to manage travel risk and decision-making behaviours in the post-COVID-19 phase.","Karl, Marion; Muskat, Birgit; Ritchie, Brent W.",Journal of Destination Marketing & Management,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212571X20301098; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212571X20301098,560
688849,Telemedicine in the United States: An Introduction for Students and Residents,2020-11-24,"Pooling multiple swab samples prior to RNA extraction and RT-PCR analysis was proposed as a strategy to reduce costs and increase throughput of SARS-CoV-2 tests. However, reports on practical large-scale group testing for SARS-CoV-2 have been scant. Key open questions concern reduced sensitivity due to sample dilution; the rate of false positives; the actual efficiency (number of tests saved by pooling) and the impact of infection rate in the population on assay performance. Here we report analysis of 133,816 samples collected at April-September 2020, tested by pooling for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. We spared 76% of RNA extraction and RT-PCR tests, despite the reality of frequently changing prevalence rate (0.5%-6%). Surprisingly, we observed pooling efficiency and sensitivity that exceed theoretical predictions, which resulted from non-random distribution of positive samples in pools. Overall, the findings strongly support the use of pooling for efficient large high throughput SARS-CoV-2 testing.","Barak, N.; Ben-Ami, R.; Sido, T.; Perri, A.; Shtoyer, A.; Rivkin, M.; Licht, T.; Peretz, A.; Magenheim, J.; Fogel, I.; Livneh, A.; Daitch, Y.; Oiknine-Djian, E.; Benedek, G.; Dor, Y.; Wolf, D.

This resulted in diarrhea, intestinal lesions and extra-intestinal invasion, suggesting that factors affecting these pathogenic properties are located on pVir. In order to analyze the respective roles of the toxins CNF2 and CDTIII in the pathogenesis, colostrum-restricted calves were inoculated with isogenic mutants in the cnf2 and the cdt-III genes. The loss of cnf2 is associated with a reduction in the pathogenicity, since diarrhea does not occur in calves challenged, in spite of successful colonization of the intestine. Nevertheless, the mutant strain remains able to invade the bloodstream and to localize in the internal organs. Conversely, the calves inoculated with mutant in the cdt-III gene evolved in the same way as wild-type strain-inoculated calves with regard to clinical signs and macroscopic or microscopic lesions.","Van Bost, Sigrid; Roels, Stefan; Oswald, Eric; Mainil, Jacques",Microbes Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1286457903002314; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14623014/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457903002314,560
689970,Implementation of Telemental Health Services Before COVID-19: Rapid Umbrella Review of Systematic Reviews,2021-07-20,"In order to plan and execute proper preventative measures against COVID-19, we need to understand how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted. It has been shown to remain infectious on surfaces from hours to days depending on surface type and environmental factors. The possibility of transmission through fur animals and contaminated pelts, along with the safety of those working with them, is a major concern. SARS-CoV-2 can infect minks and raccoon dogs and has spread to mink farms in numerous countries. Here, we studied the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on blue fox, Finn raccoon, and American mink pelt, fake fur, cotton, plastic, faux leather, and polyester and tested its inactivation by UV light and heat treatment. We detected infectious virus up to 5 days on plastic, up to 1 day on fake fur, less than a day on cotton, polyester, and faux leather, and even 10 days on mink fur. UV light failed to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 on pelts, most likely due to the mechanical protection by the fur. Hence, it should not be used to inactivate the virus on fur products, and its use for other surfaces should also be considered carefully. Heat treatment at 60°C for 1 h inactivated the virus on all surfaces and is a promising method to be applied in practice. This study helps prevent further spread of COVID-19 by increasing our understanding about risks of SARS-CoV-2 spread through contaminated clothing materials and giving important information needed to improve safety of those working in the production line as well as people using the products.","Virtanen, Jenni; Aaltonen, Kirsi; Kivistö, Ilkka; Sironen, Tarja",Adv Virol,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6623409; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33927762/,560

Invading, replicating, and escaping from different cell types, along with exploiting each intracellular niche, necessitate large and dynamic changes in parasite morphology and cellular architecture. The inner membrane complex (IMC) is a unique structural element that is intricately involved with these distinct morphological changes. The IMC is a double membrane organelle that forms de novo and is located beneath the plasma membrane of these single-celled organisms. In Plasmodium spp. parasites it has three major purposes: it confers stability and shape to the cell, functions as an important scaffolding compartment during the formation of daughter cells, and plays a major role in motility and invasion. Recent years have revealed greater insights into the architecture, protein composition and function of the IMC. Here, we discuss the multiple roles of the IMC in each parasite lifecycle stage as well as insights into its sub-compartmentalization, biogenesis, disassembly and regulation during stage conversion of P. falciparum.","Ferreira, Josie Liane; Heincke, Dorothee; Wichers, Jan Stephan; Liffner, Benjamin; Wilson, Danny W.; Gilberger, Tim-Wolf",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33489940/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2020.611801,560
