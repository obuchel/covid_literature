47542,Factors Affecting the Perceived Level of Stress Among Students Taking Entrepreneurship Program in a Public University in Malaysia,2021-02-01,"A brief summary of the natural science understanding of the gravity and urgency of climate change is presented as an essential building block for the social science analysis in subsequent chapters. It documents that fossil-fuel emissions are the principal causes and the atmosphere is the main carbon sink. It shows that concepts like the net change in atmospheric carbon (emissions compared to carbon withdrawals) and carbon budget are more valid than oft-used, misleading indicators of improvement like carbon intensity (emissions per GDP). The chapter documents differences in emissions for various types of fossil fuels, including different types of oil. It elucidates limitations of the social influence of science, particularly its contradictory characteristics as ineffective when warning of danger yet inspiring faith in its omnipotence to master nature so as to maintain fossil-fuelled practices. The chapter also assesses the concept of the Anthropocene.","Murphy, Raymond",The Fossil-Fuelled Climate Crisis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972066/,814

70600,Anlotinib as a molecular targeted therapy for tumors.,2020-08-01,"MAIN CONCLUSION Responses of plant biomass and yield components to warming are species-specific and are shifted as increased warming magnitude rises; this finding improves the results of IPCC AR5. The responses of crop yields to climatic warming have been extensively reported from experimental results, historical yield collections, and modeling research. However, an integrative report on the responses of plant biomass and yield components of three major crops to experimental warming is lacking. Here, a meta-analysis based on the most recent warming experiments was conducted to quantify the climatic warming responses of the biomass, grain yield (GY), and yield components of three staple crops. The results showed that the wheat total aboveground biomass (TAGB) increased by 6.0% with general warming, while the wheat GY did not significantly respond to warming; however, the responses shifted with increases in the mean growing season temperature (MGST). Negative effects on wheat TAGB and GY appeared when the MGSTs were above 15 °C and 13 °C, respectively. The wheat GY and the number of grains per panicle decreased by 8.4% and 7.5%, respectively, per degree Celsius increase. Increases in temperature significantly reduced the rice TAGB and GY by 4.3% and 16.6%, respectively, but rice straw biomass increased with increasing temperature. However, the rice grain weight and the number of panicles decreased with continuous increasing temperature (ΔTa). The maize biomass, GY, and yield components all generally decreased with climatic warming. Finally, the crop responses to climatic warming were significantly influenced by warming time, warming treatment facility, and methods. Our findings can improve the assessment of crop responses to climatic warming and are useful for ensuring food security while combating future global climate change.","Liu, Xiaodi; Ma, Quanhui; Yu, Hongying; Li, Yibo; Zhou, Li; He, Qijin; Xu, Zhenzhu; Zhou, Guangsheng",Planta,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00425-020-03495-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083898/,814

No vaccine is currently available. OBJECTIVE To assess the safety and immunogenicity of Ad26.ZIKV.001, a prophylactic ZIKV vaccine candidate. DESIGN Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03356561). SETTING United States. PARTICIPANTS 100 healthy adult volunteers. INTERVENTION Ad26.ZIKV.001, an adenovirus serotype 26 vector encoding ZIKV M-Env, administered in 1- or 2-dose regimens of 5 × 1010 or 1 × 1011 viral particles (vp), or placebo. MEASUREMENTS Local and systemic adverse events; neutralization titers by microneutralization assay (MN50) and T-cell responses by interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunospot and intracellular cytokine staining; and protectivity of vaccine-induced antibodies in a subset of participants through transfer in an exploratory mouse ZIKV challenge model. RESULTS All regimens were well tolerated, with no safety concerns identified. In both 2-dose regimens, ZIKV neutralizing titers peaked 14 days after the second vaccination, with geometric mean MN50 titers (GMTs) of 1065.6 (95% CI, 494.9 to 2294.5) for 5 × 1010 vp and 956.6 (595.8 to 1535.8) for 1 × 1011 vp. Titers persisted for at least 1 year at a GMT of 68.7 (CI, 26.4-178.9) for 5 × 1010 vp and 87.0 (CI, 29.3 to 258.6) for 1 × 1011 vp. A 1-dose regimen of 1 × 1011 vp Ad26.ZIKV.001 induced seroconversion in all participants 56 days after the first vaccination (GMT, 103.4 [CI, 52.7 to 202.9]), with titers persisting for at least 1 year (GMT, 90.2 [CI, 38.4 to 212.2]). Env-specific cellular responses were induced. Protection against ZIKV challenge was observed after antibody transfer from participants into mice, and MN50 titers correlated with protection in this model. LIMITATION The study was conducted in a nonendemic area, so it did not assess safety and immunogenicity in a flavivirus-exposed population. CONCLUSION The safety and immunogenicity profile makes Ad26.ZIKV.001 a promising candidate for further development if the need reemerges.

91728,[The comparative analysis of population attitude to vaccination against COVID-19 infection in foreign countries and in Russia].,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND Recent small case series have now been reported for robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy (RALRC). In most of these series, the urinary diversion has been performed in an extracorporeal fashion. There have been few case reports of an intracorporeal diversion and little description of the technique of such a procedure. OBJECTIVE In this paper, we report our initial experience with robotic-assisted laparoscopic intracorporeal urinary diversion, describing stepwise the surgical procedure itself and evaluating perioperative and pathologic outcomes of this novel procedure. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We studied a single-institution case series of patients undergoing robotic-assisted cystectomy and intracorporeal urinary diversion for clinically localized urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (n=10) or for a noncompliant dysfunctional bladder refractory to more conservative management (n=2). Historical comparisons are also made to a consecutive case series of 20 patients undergoing robotic radical cystectomy and extracorporeal urinary diversion. SURGICAL PROCEDURE RALRC and intracorporeal urinary diversion, including ileal conduit (n=9) and orthotopic ileal neobladder (n=3). MEASUREMENTS The stepwise operative procedure is described in detail. Outcome measures evaluated in this series included operative variables, hospital recovery, and complication rate. Comparisons were made to a contemporaneous series of 20 patients who underwent a robotic cystectomy with extracorporeal diversion during this time period (from an experience of >100 robotic cystectomy patients since 2005). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Twelve patients (mean age: 60.9 yr) underwent an intracorporeal diversion. Mean operating-room time of all patients was 5.3h, and mean surgical blood loss was 221ml. Mean time to flatus, bowel movement, and hospital discharge was 2.2 d, 3.2 d, and 4.5 d, respectively. Eleven of the 12 patients were discharged on or before postoperative day 5. There were six postoperative complications in five patients (42%), with one complication being Clavien grade 3 or higher. The major limitations of the study are the small sample size and the nonrandomized nature of the compared treatment groups (intracorporeal vs extracorporeal), which limits the ability to directly compare the techniques at a high level of scientific confidence. CONCLUSIONS Our initial experience with robotic-assisted laparoscopic intracorporeal diversion appears to be favorable with acceptable operative and short-term clinical outcomes.","Pruthi, Raj S; Nix, Jeff; McRackan, Dan; Hickerson, Adam; Nielsen, Matthew E; Raynor, Matthew; Wallen, Eric M",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2009.12.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20079567/,814

CZZ-1T was pink-pigmented, Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, non-motile and aerobic. The 16S rRNA gene analysis indicated that strain CZZ-1T shows high similarities to Fluviicola taffensis DSM 16823T (92.6%) and Fluviicola hefeinensis KACC 16597T (92.5%) and less than 91% sequence similarities to other genus or species in the family Crocinitomicaceae.

104038,[The attitude of the youth to vaccine prevention of influenza in conditions of COVID-19 pandemic].,2021-03-01,"Bariatric revision surgery is associated with several complications that can be attributed to decreased quality of tissue and complexity of the surgery. A laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is a simple technique with potential advantages. Therefore, the results of this procedure were evaluated as a revisional option. Fifty-one patients underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Indications for the LSG were insufficient weight loss (34 patients, group 1) or vomiting (17 patients, group 2) following a laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) or vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG). Patient and procedure characteristics as well as outcome were collected prospectively. From October 2006 to June 2010, 51 patients with a failed prior bariatic procedure (VBG or LAGB) were converted to (L)SG. The conversion rate was zero. The median procedure time was 99 min (range 54-221) and hospital stay was 3 days (range 2-38). There was no mortality after 30 days. Complications included bleeding (six) and leakage of the staple line (seven). Mean follow-up was 13.8 (2-46) months. LSG as revision surgery for insufficient weight loss resulted in extra weight loss of 52.7%, and the overall extra weight loss was 49.3%. When LSG was performed because of vomiting, 82% was able to eat solid food at follow-up. Of the 65 pre-existent co-morbidities, 21 were resolved and 18 improved. LSG as a revision procedure is feasible. An additional weight loss and further resolution of co-morbidity seem achievable, however, at the cost of a high number of complications. Therefore, revision bariatric surgery should be limited to expert tertiary bariatric centers.","Berende, Cornelis Adrianus Sebastianus; de Zoete, Jean-Paul; Smulders, Johannes Franciscus; Nienhuijs, Simon Willem",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-011-0501-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21866377/,814
114601,[MODERNIZATION OF SOCIAL PROTECTION IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION: PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF TELEMEDICINE IN THE PRACTICE OF MEDICAL-SOCIAL EXPERTISE].,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Maternal nutrition during gestation and lactation is essential for offspring's health. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of betaine hydrochloride addition to sow diets during gestation and lactation on suckling piglet's immunity and intestine microbiota composition. Forty Bama mini-pigs were randomly allocated into two groups and fed a basal diet (control group) and basal diet with 3.50 kg ton-1 betaine hydrochloride (betaine group) from day 3 after mating to day 21 of lactation. After 21 days of the delivery, 12 suckling piglets from each group with similar body weight were selected for sample collection. RESULTS The results showed that maternal betaine hydrochloride addition decreased (P < 0.05) the plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in suckling piglets. Furthermore, dietary betaine hydrochloride addition in sow diets increased (P < 0.05) the villus height (VH) and VH to crypt depth ratio in the jejunum and ileum of suckling piglets. In the piglets' intestinal microbiota community, the relative abundances of Roseburia (P < 0.05) and Clostridium (P = 0.059) were lower in the betaine group than those in the control group. Moreover, betaine hydrochloride addition in sow diets decreased the colonic tyramine (P = 0.091) and skatole (P = 0.070) concentrations in suckling piglets. CONCLUSION Betaine hydrochloride addition in sow diets enhanced the intestinal morphology, improved immunity, and altered intestinal microbiota of suckling piglets. These findings indicated that betaine hydrochloride addition in sow diets during gestation and lactation will impact suckling piglets' health. This article is protected by copyright.

This study attempts to determine whether a faster absorbing suture material such as polyglytone 6211 will lead to fewer complications such as extrusion and granuloma formation as compared with less rapidly absorbing materials such as poliglecaprone 25. Concomitantly, this study also attempts to explore the possible negative outcomes that may be due to faster loss of strength, such as dehiscence and poor scar aesthetics. We found that extrusion occurs less frequently with the rapidly absorbed polyglytone 6211 suture material, without increase in granuloma formation, infection, dehiscence, cellulitis, necrosis, seroma formation, and hematoma formation. We also observed no clinical difference in the cosmetic appearance of scars at the 12-week postoperative follow-up visit.","Naghshineh, Nima; Ota, Kenneth S; Tang, Lawton; O'Toole, James; Rubin, J Peter",Annals of plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0b013e3181c1fe2f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20585236/,814

METHODS Patients who underwent laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair in our hospital between 2005 and 2009 were interviewed and examined. Surgery outcome, hernia recurrence, postoperative pain and time to return to normal physical activities, and surgery satisfaction were compared. RESULTS During the study period 389 consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic groin hernia repair: 387 by the total extraperitoneal (TEP) approach and 2 by the TAPP approach. Six of the TEP patients were converted to TAPP. Eighty-seven patients in the TEP group had slit mesh placement and 300 had non-slit mesh placement. Mean follow-up was 36 months (range: 6-66 months). At follow-up, 387 patients responded to a request for interview and 277 were examined. The overall recurrence rate was 4.7%, the incidence of constant postoperative pain was 1.3%, the presence of permanent testicular pain was 2.8%, and patient satisfaction with the surgery was 94.5%. A significantly lower recurrence rate was found in the slit mesh group than in the non-slit group (0.6% versus 5.9%; p < 0.003). There was no difference in the length of time until return to normal activities, patient satisfaction, and postoperative pain between the groups. Surgery time and the occurrence of testicular pain were significantly greater in the anatomic group. CONCLUSIONS Total extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair with slit mesh placement is a safe technique with a very low recurrence rate and is superior to non-slit mesh positioning.","Domniz, Noam; Perry, Zvi Howard; Lantsberg, Leonid; Avinoach, Eliezer; Mizrahi, Solly; Kirshtein, Boris",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-011-1251-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21935723/,814

Objectives This study aimed to examine the epidemiological characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak in Ghana and identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease. Method This was a cross-sectional study involving the data of patients with COVID-19 clinically managed at the Ga-East Municipal Hospital, the main COVID-19 treatment centre in Ghana, from 21st March to 21st June 2020. The data were retrieved from the electronic medical records and folders of the patients. It included sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 disease severity, and treatment outcomes. Binomial logistic regression was used to identify risk factors of severe COVID-19 illness. Result Among the 360 COVID-19 cases in this study, 55.3% were males, and 44.7% were females. Their mean age was 39.9 years. Most of them were Ghanaians (92.8%) and employed (72.5%). The majority (93%) presented with mild disease, and hypertension (19.2%) was the most common comorbidity. The average length of hospital admission was 10.6 days. Many of the cases recovered (98.6%), resulting in a case fatality of 1.4%. Finally, the logistic regression showed that increasing age (OR=1.12, p= 0.002) and diabetes mellitus (OR=19.85, p=0.007) are risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease. Conclusion Findings from the study confirmed that increasing age and diabetes mellitus are risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease.

191023,10 years later...,2013,"Poult enteritis and mortality syndrome (PEMS) is an acute, infectious intestinal disease of turkey poults, characterized by high mortality and 100% morbidity, that decimated the turkey industry in the mid-1990s. The etiology of PEMS is not completely understood. This report describes the testing of various filtrates of fecal material from control and PEMS-affected poults by oral inoculation into poults under experimental conditions, the subsequent isolation of a reovirus, ARV-CU98, from one of the PEMS fecal filtrates, and in vivo and in vitro studies conducted to determine the pathogenicity of ARV-CU98 in turkey poults. In order to identify a filtrate fraction of fecal material containing a putative etiologic agent, poults were challenged in two independent experiments with 220- and 100-nm filtrates of fecal material from PEMS-negative and PEMS-positive poults. The 100-nm filtrate was chosen for further evaluation because poults inoculated with this filtrate exhibited mortality and significantly lower (P < or = 0.05) body weight and relative bursa weight, three clinical signs associated with PEMS. These results were confirmed in a third experiment with 100-nm fecal filtrates from a separate batch of PEMS fecal material. In Experiment 3, body weight and relative bursa and thymus weights were significantly lower (P < or = 0.05) in poults inoculated with 100-nm filtrate of PEMS fecal material as compared with poults inoculated with 100-nm filtrate of control fecal material. Subsequently, a virus was isolated from the 100-nm PEMS fecal filtrate and propagated in liver cells. This virus was identified as a reovirus on the basis of cross-reaction with antisera against avian reovirus (FDO strain) as well as by electrophoretic analysis and was designated ARV-CU98. When inoculated orally into poults reared under controlled environmental conditions in isolators, ARV-CU98 was associated with a higher incidence of thymic hemorrhaging and gaseous intestines. In addition, relative bursa and liver weights were significantly lower (P < or = 0.05) in virus-inoculated poults as compared with controls. Virus was successfully reisolated from virus-challenged poults but not from control birds. Furthermore, viral antigen was detected by immunofluorescence in liver sections from virus-challenged poults at 3 and 6 days postinfection and virus was isolated from liver at 6 days postinfection, suggesting that ARV-CU98 replicates in the liver. In addition to a decrease in liver weight, there was a functional degeneration as indicated by altered plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities in virus poults as compared with controls. Although this reovirus does not induce fulminating PEMS, our results demonstrated that ARV-CU98 does cause some of the clinical signs in PEMS, including intestinal alterations and significantly lower relative bursa and liver weights. ARV-CU98 may contribute directly to PEMS by affecting the intestine, bursa, and liver and may contribute indirectly by increasing susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens that facilitate development of clinical PEMS.","Heggen-Peay, C L; Qureshi, M A; Edens, F W; Sherry, B; Wakenell, P S; O'Connell, P H; Schat, K A",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11922348/,814

194040,The time of cholera.,2011,"Background and aims With the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic declining, activities in the gastrointestinal clinic are being recommenced after a period of stringent measures. Since a second COVID-19 wave is not entirely ruled out health care professionals might remain faced with the need to perform endoscopic procedures in patients with a confirmed positive or unknown COVID-19 status. With this report we aim to provide a practical relevant overview of preparation and protective measures for gastroenterologists based on the currently available guidelines and our local experience and results of a national Belgian survey, to guarantee a fast recall of an adequate infection prevention if COVID-19 reoccurs. Methods From the 23rd of March 2020 and the 13th of May 2020 we performed a Pubmed, Embase and Medline search, resulting in 37 papers on COVID-19 and endoscopy. Additionally, we combined these data with data acquired from the national BSGIE survey amongst Belgian gastroenterologists. Results Based on 72 completed surveys in both university and non-university hospitals, the results show (1) a dramatic (<20%) or substantial (<50%) decrease of normal daily endoscopy in 74% and 22% of the units respectively, (2) a difference in screening and protective measures between university and non-university hospitals. These findings were subsequently compared with the current guidelines. Conclusion Based on new data from the BSGIE survey and current guidelines we tried to realistically represent the current COVID-19 trends in protective measures, screening and indications for endoscopy and to provide a practical overview as preparation for a possible second wave.","Sinonquel, P; Aerts, M; Badaoui, A; Bisschops, R; Blero, D; Demedts, I; Deprez, P; Dewint, P; Eisendrath, P; Hindryckx, P; Lemmers, A; Roelandt, Ph; Snauwaert, C; Toussaint, E; Moreels, T",Acta gastro-enterologica Belgica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32603061/,814
198701,Infectious disease management: lessons from cuba.,2006,"Neuroattenuated variants of mouse hepatitis virus type 4 (MHV-4) selected for resistance to neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (R.G. Dalziel, P.W. Lampert, P. J. Talbot, and M. J. Buchmeier, J. Virol. 59:463-471, 1986) were found to harbor large deletions in both mRNA 3 and its protein product, the 180-kilodalton viron spike (S) glycoprotein. By using antipeptide antibodies directed against selected portions of the chain, deletions were mapped to the middle of the amino-terminal S1 fragment, one of the two posttranslational cleavage products of S, and involved omission of 15 kilodaltons of protein. Deletion mutants could be selected only after multiple passage of virus through cultured cell lines; minimally passaged MHV-4 stocks contained putative point mutants selectable by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies but no deletions. Enhanced growth of deletion mutants relative to wild-type virus was observed in four cell lines used for virus propagation and was attributed to delayed and diminished cytopathic effects that allowed cultures to support virus production for prolonged periods. This hypothesis was reinforced by the finding that no selective advantage for the deletion mutants was observed in two cell lines resistant to virus-induced cytopathic effects. These results indicate that the passaging of MHV-4 in culture generates heterogeneity in S structure and eventually selects for rare neutralization-resistant deletion mutants with decreased virulence properties.","Gallagher, T M; Parker, S E; Buchmeier, M J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1688627/,814
198827,Immunization in Canada 2007.,2007,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the etiological agent of SARS. It is believed that SARS-CoV originates from wild animals. We have developed a multitarget real-time Taqman reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay for the quantitative detection of SARS-CoV. The sequences of the Taqman probes with a minor groove binder and the corresponding primers were based on the sequences of the N gene, open reading frame (ORF) 3, and ORF 8. The overall linear range of this assay was from at least 10(1) to 10(6) copies per reaction, and the detection limit could reach less than 10 copies per reaction. The quantification results for SARS-CoV from cell culture correlated well with those of the RT-PCR by using any two of the three sets of primer and probe used in this assay. However, the results of quantification of SARS-CoV obtained by using a few available throat swab specimens from SARS patients and the N gene as the target were almost 10 times higher than those obtained by using ORF 3 and ORF 8. Using this assay, we also detected an apparently SARS-CoV-related coronavirus in the throat swab specimens from masked palm civets in the west part of Hubei Province, People's Republic of China.","Hu, Wenqian; Bai, Bingke; Hu, Zhihong; Chen, Ze; An, Xuefang; Tang, Lijun; Yang, Jihong; Wang, Hualin; Wang, Hanzhong",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15872219/,814

Globally, there is an urgent need to use safe and effective vaccines for immunization to achieve comprehensive protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Focusing on developing a rapid vaccine platform with significant immunogenicity as well as broad and high protection efficiency, we designed a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) displayed on self-assembled ferritin nanoparticles. In a 293i cells eukaryotic expression system, this candidate vaccine was prepared and purified. After rhesus monkeys are immunized with 20 µg of RBD-ferritin nanoparticles three times, the vaccine can elicit specific humoral immunity and T cell immune response, and the neutralizing antibodies can cross-neutralize four SARS-CoV-2 strains from different sources. In the challenge protection test, after nasal infection with 2 × 105 CCID50 SARS-CoV-2 virus, compared with unimmunized control animals, virus replication in the vaccine-immunized rhesus monkeys was significantly inhibited, and respiratory pathology observations also showed only slight pathological damage. These analyses will benefit the immunization program of the RBD-ferritin nanoparticle vaccine in the clinical trial design and the platform construction to present a specific antigen domain in the self-assembling nanoparticle in a short time to harvest stable, safe, and effective vaccine candidates for new SARS-CoV-2 isolates.","Li, Heng; Guo, Lei; Zheng, Huiwen; Li, Jing; Zhao, Xin; Li, Jiaqi; Liang, Yan; Yang, Fengmei; Zhao, Yurong; Yang, Jinling; Xue, Mengyi; Zuo, Yuanyuan; Zhou, Jian; Chen, Yanli; Yang, Zening; Li, Yanyan; Jin, Weihua; Shi, Haijing; He, Zhanlong; Li, Qihan; Liu, Longding",Bioconjug Chem,,814

We aim to summarize the challenges faced by LMICs in providing breast cancer care during the pandemic and their response during this crisis. Recent Findings: Conversion of oncology centers into COVID-19 isolation centers and lack of LMIC applicable guidelines for breast cancer treatment worsened the challenge for providers. Few LMICs changed their management framework, taking steps like triaging patients, prioritizing care, therapeutic spacing, and a shift to telehealth. Summary: Modified protocols where available have served LMICs well for resource allocation; however, effectiveness of these cannot be determined due to lack of outcomes reporting. This pandemic has underscored the importance of flexibility, prompt intervention, good communication, and reassessment to address unexpected healthcare challenges and has been a learning lesson to help tailor guidelines early in the future.","Shahzad, Hania; Mubarik, Fatima; Sattar, Abida K",Curr Breast Cancer Rep,,814

The end-to-side anastomosis hasnt been used often compared to the termino-terminal technique, because the former is contested by some authors regarded the reinervation chances when the integrity of the epineuro is maintened. Therefore, due to the divergenses, the authors decide to study the effects of epineuro in the nervous regeneration in the end-to-side anastomosis technique. In this study, 20 wistar adults rats were used, distributed in two groups (A and B). In the A Group, 10 rats were submited to the section of fibular nerve in the right pelvic limb and fixation of this nerve to the muscle; in the left pelvic limb, section of the fibular nerve was done with lateral anastomosis with the fibular nerve. In Group B, the procedures were indentical to the A group, with the only difference that the limbs were exchanged. In the 90 th post operative day a biopsy was performed in each fibular nerve in order to histological analisys in optical microscope, where the reinervation was object of study.

A convenience sample of 438 women between the ages of 30 and 60 completed an online survey. We found a significant correlation between daughters' and mothers' perceived COVID-19 worries. This association was moderated by the daughters' regard. For those daughters that characterized their relations as high on regard, higher levels of COVID-19 worries were associated with higher levels of perceived worries among mothers.

To address this issue, we simulated control strategies for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a real-world social network generated from high-resolution GPS data that were gathered in the course of a citizen-science experiment3,4. We found that tracing the contacts of contacts reduced the size of simulated outbreaks more than tracing of only contacts, but this strategy also resulted in almost half of the local population being quarantined at a single point in time. Testing and releasing non-infectious individuals from quarantine led to increases in outbreak size, suggesting that contact tracing and quarantine might be most effective as a 'local lockdown' strategy when contact rates are high. Finally, we estimated that combining physical distancing with contact tracing could enable epidemic control while reducing the number of quarantined individuals. Our findings suggest that targeted tracing and quarantine strategies would be most efficient when combined with other control measures such as physical distancing.","Firth, Josh A; Hellewell, Joel; Klepac, Petra; Kissler, Stephen; Kucharski, Adam J; Spurgin, Lewis G",Nat Med,,814
466746,COVID-19 and the reenactment of mass masking in South Korea,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic involving >5 500 000 cases worldwide as of May 26, 2020. The culprit is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, which invades cells by binding to ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). While the majority of patients mount an appropriate antiviral response and recover at home, others progress to respiratory distress requiring hospital admission for supplemental oxygen. In severe cases, deterioration to acute respiratory distress syndrome necessitating mechanical ventilation, development of severe thrombotic events, or cardiac injury and dysfunction occurs. In this review, we highlight what is known to date about COVID-19 and cardiovascular risk, focusing in on the putative role of the endothelium in disease susceptibility and pathogenesis. Approach and Results: Cytokine-driven vascular leak in the lung alveolar-endothelial interface facilitates acute lung injury in the setting of viral infection. Given that the virus affects multiple organs, including the heart, it likely gains access into systemic circulation by infecting or passing from the respiratory epithelium to the endothelium for viral dissemination. Indeed, cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 are highly prevalent and include acute cardiac injury, myocarditis, and a hypercoagulable state, all of which may be influenced by altered endothelial function. Notably, the disease course is worse in individuals with preexisting comorbidities that involve endothelial dysfunction and may be linked to elevated ACE2 expression, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: Rapidly emerging data on COVID-19, together with results from studies on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1, are providing insight into how endothelial dysfunction may contribute to the pandemic that is paralyzing the globe. This may, in turn, inform the design of biomarkers predictive of disease course, as well as therapeutics targeting pathogenic endothelial responses.","Gustafson, Dakota; Raju, Sneha; Wu, Ruilin; Ching, Crizza; Veitch, Shawn; Rathnakumar, Kumaragurubaran; Boudreau, Emilie; Howe, Kathryn L; Fish, Jason E",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,,814

In March 2020, the World Health Organization determined that the COVID-19 outbreak is a global pandemic. The urgency and magnitude of this pandemic demanded immediate action and coordination between local, regional, national, and international actors. In that mission, researchers require access to high-quality biological materials and data from SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected patients, covering the spectrum of disease manifestations. The ""Biobanque québécoise de la COVID-19"" (BQC19) is a pan-provincial initiative undertaken in Québec, Canada to enable the collection, storage and sharing of samples and data related to the COVID-19 crisis. As a disease-oriented biobank based on high-quality biosamples and clinical data of hospitalized and non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive and negative individuals. The BQC19 follows a legal and ethical management framework approved by local health authorities. The biosamples include plasma, serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and DNA and RNA isolated from whole blood. In addition to the clinical variables, BQC19 will provide in-depth analytical data derived from the biosamples including whole genome and transcriptome sequencing, proteome and metabolome analyses, multiplex measurements of key circulating markers as well as anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses. BQC19 will provide the scientific and medical communities access to data and samples to better understand, manage and ultimately limit, the impact of COVID-19. In this paper we present BQC19, describe the process according to which it is governed and organized, and address opportunities for future research collaborations.

472469,COVID-19 as the underlying cause of death: disentangling facts and values,2021,"RATIONALE: The new coronavirus pneumonia Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. Patients with critically COVID-19 usually require invasive respiratory support, and the airway management is particularly important and the prognosis is poor. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 64-year-old man with an anastomotic fistula after radical treatment of esophageal cancer and right-side encapsulated pyopneumothorax was admitted with cough and dyspnea. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with novel coronavirus pneumonia and right-side encapsulated pyopneumothorax by pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test in combination with chest computed tomography (CT). INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with antibiotics, antiviral and antibacterial medications, respiratory support, expectorant nebulization, and nutritional support. But he expressed progressive deterioration. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were performed since the onset of the type - respiratory failure on the 13th day of admission. The patient had persistent refractory hypercapnia after mechanical ventilation. Based on the treatment mentioned above, combined with repeated bronchoalveolar lavage by using N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhalation solution, the patients refractory hypercapnia was gradually improved. OUTCOMES: The patient was cured and discharged after being given the mechanical ventilation for 26 days as well as 46 days of hospitalization, currently is surviving well. LESSONS: Patients with severe conditions of novel coronavirus pneumonia often encounter bacterial infection in their later illness-stages. They may suffer respiratory failure and refractory hypercapnia that is difficult to improve due to excessive mucus secretion leading to small airway obstruction. This study provided a new insight on the proper treatment severe COVID-19 patients. The use of reasonable antibiotics and symptomatic respiratory support and other treatment, timely artificial airway and repeated bronchoalveolar NAC inhalation solution lavage, expectorant and other airway management are essential for such patients.","Liu, Yan; Wang, Meifang; Luo, Guoshi; Qian, Xin; Wu, Chenglin; Zhang, Yizhong; Chen, Biyu; Leung, Elaine Lai-Han; Tang, Yijun",Medicine (Baltimore),,814
473231,Screening of FDA-Approved Drugs Using a MERS-CoV Clinical Isolate from South Korea Identifies Potential Therapeutic Options for COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Bone fracture may subsequently cause chronic postoperative pain after orthopedic surgery, but mechanisms remain elusive. The necessity of caspase-3 in neuroinflammation and synaptic plasticity has been summarized in pathological pain. Leucine-rich repeat transmembrane protein 1 (LRRTM1) mediates synaptic delivery of AMPA receptor and synaptogenesis. This study evaluated whether caspase-3 and LRRTM1 are required for fracture-associated postoperative allodynia. METHODS: A model of tibial fracture with intramedullary pinning in mice was established for the induction of postoperative pain, verified by measurement of mechanical paw withdrawal threshold and cold scores response to acetone. The caspase-3 specific inhibitor, recombinant caspase-3 and LRRTM1 knockdown by shRNA were utilized for the investigation of pathogenesis as well as the prevention of allodynia. Also, the activity of caspase-3 and the expression of LRRTM1 in the spinal dorsal horn were examined by Western blot and RT-qPCR. RESULTS: This study reported that tibial fracture and orthopedic surgery produced long-lasting mechanical allodynia and cold allodynia, along with the up-modulation of spinal caspase-3 activity (but not caspase-3 expression) and LRRTM1 expression. Spinal caspase-3 inhibition prevented fracture-associated behavioral allodynia in a dose-dependent manner. Caspase-3 inhibitor also reduced the spinal increased LRRTM1 level after tibial fracture with pinning. Spinal LRRTM1 deficiency impaired fracture-caused postoperative pain. Intrathecal recombinant caspase-3 facilitated acute pain hypersensitivity and spinal LRRTM1 expression in naïve mice, reversing by LRRTM1 knockdown. CONCLUSION: Our current results demonstrate the spinal up-regulation of LRRTM1 by caspase-3 activation in the development of tibial fracture-associated postoperative pain in mice.","Zhang, Linlin; Li, Jing; Li, Yize; Wang, Zhen; Wang, Guolin; Yu, Yonghao; Song, Chengcheng; Cui, Wei",Neurosci Lett,,814

Measurements of atmospheric organic (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) were conducted during the lockdown period (April 2020) due to global COVID 19 outbreak and compared with the normal period (April 2019). The interesting, unexpected and surprising observation is that OC, EC and the total CA (TCA) during the lockdown (OC: 12.1â¯±â¯5.5â¯µgâ¯m-3; EC: 2.2â¯±â¯1.1â¯µgâ¯m-3; TCA: 21.5â¯±â¯10â¯µgâ¯m-3) were higher than the normal period (OC: 7.04â¯±â¯2.2â¯µgâ¯m-3; EC: 1.9â¯±â¯0.7â¯µgâ¯m-3; TCA: 13.2â¯±â¯4.1â¯µgâ¯m-3). The higher values for OC/EC ratio too was observed during the lockdown (5.7â¯±â¯0.9) compared to the normal period (4.2â¯±â¯1.1). Much higher surface O3 during the lockdown (due to very low NO) could better promote the formation of secondary OC (SOC) through the photochemical oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted from Himalayan coniferous forest cover. SOC during the lockdown (7.6â¯±â¯3.5â¯µgâ¯m-3) was double of that in normal period (3.8â¯±â¯1.4â¯µgâ¯m-3). Regression analysis between SOC and O3 showed that with the same amount of increase in O3, the SOC formation increased to a larger extent when anthropogenic emissions were very low and biogenic emissions dominate (lockdown) compared to when anthropogenic emissions were high (normal). Concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis showed that the anthropogenic activities over Nepal and forest fire over north-east India were the major long-distant sources of the CA over Darjeeling during the normal period. On the other hand, during lockdown, the major source regions of CA over Darjeeling were regional/local. The findings of the study indicate the immense importance of Himalayan biosphere as a major source of organic carbon.","Chatterjee, Abhijit; Mukherjee, Sauryadeep; Dutta, Monami; Ghosh, Abhinandan; Ghosh, Sanjay K; Roy, Arindam",Atmos Environ (1994),,814

CONCLUSION: The present study suggested that preconditioning with HMGB1 could induce HMGB1 tolerance and protect against myocardial I/R injury.","Hu, Xiaorong; Jiang, Hong; Cui, Bo; Xu, Changwu; Lu, Zhibing; He, Bo",Int J Cardiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2009.05.057; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167527309006445; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167527309006445; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19540007/,814
599390,Imagination and remembrance: what role should historical epidemiology play in a world bewitched by mathematical modelling of COVID-19 and other epidemics?,2021-06-07,"Biological material including microorganisms and toxins can be found in air or the atmosphere, and the study of this area is termed “aeromicrobiology.” Airborne biological materials are known as bioaerosols. This chapter introduces the basics of aeromicrobiology including the nature of bioaerosols and fundamentals of the aeromicrobiological (AMB) pathway. The nature of the atmosphere as a microbial habitat, and the factors that influence microbial survival in the air are described. This is followed by a discussion of extramural aeromicrobiology related to aerosolization of indigenous soil pathogens; influenza pandemics; microbiology in the clouds; agriculture; waste disposal; and airborne toxins. Intramural microbiology within buildings is discussed with respect to public health within buildings, hospitals and laboratories. Finally, measures to control bioaerosols including biosafety in the laboratory are documented.","Pepper, Ian L.; Gerba, Charles P.",Environmental Microbiology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123946263000053; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123946263000053,814
623887,[economic Aspects of Providing Paid Medical Services in Russia during the Pandemic],2021,"This study explored the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on perceived health behaviors; physical activity, sleep, and diet behaviors, alongside associations with wellbeing. Participants were 1,140 individuals residing in the United Kingdom (n = 230), South Korea (n = 204), Finland (n = 171), Philippines (n = 132), Latin America (n = 124), Spain (n = 112), North America (n = 87), and Italy (n = 80). They completed an online survey reporting possible changes in the targeted behaviors as well as perceived changes in their physical and mental health. Multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVA) on the final sample (n = 1,131) revealed significant mean differences regarding perceived physical and mental health “over the last week,” as well as changes in health behaviors during the pandemic by levels of physical activity and country of residence. Follow up analyses indicated that individuals with highest decrease in physical activity reported significantly lower physical and mental health, while those with highest increase in physical activity reported significantly higher increase in sleep and lower weight gain. United Kingdom participants reported lowest levels of physical health and highest increase in weight while Latin American participants reported being most affected by emotional problems. Finnish participants reported significantly higher ratings for physical health. The physical activity by country interaction was significant for wellbeing. MANCOVA also revealed significant differences across physical activity levels and four established age categories. Participants in the oldest category reported being significantly least affected by personal and emotional problems; youngest participants reported significantly more sleep. The age by physical activity interaction was significant for eating. Discussed in light of Hobfoll (1998) conservation of resources theory, findings endorse the policy of advocating physical activity as a means of generating and maintaining resources combative of stress and protective of health.","Ruiz, Montse C.; Devonport, Tracey J.; Chen-Wilson, Chao-Hwa (Josephine); Nicholls, Wendy; Cagas, Jonathan Y.; Fernandez-Montalvo, Javier; Choi, Youngjun; Robazza, Claudio",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33510684/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.608216,814
627369,The meaning of Freedom after Covid-19,2021-01-08,"There have been several viral pandemics that have swept the globe over the past century. The latest one is the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this mini review, we outline the epidemiology, clinical presentation, management and prognosis of COVID-19. The pandemic is part of a rapidly changing landscape and it remains to be seen how events will unfold in South Africa, where there is a large reservoir of young people with sub-optimal lung immunity due to several causes, including HIV, post-tuberculous lung disease, smoking, biomass fuel exposure and poor socioeconomic circumstances.","Richards, G; Stacey, S",African Journal of Thoracic &amp; Critical Care Medicine,https://doi.org/10.7196/ajtccm.2020.v26i2.068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34235423/,814
630949,"Letter by Vazgiourakis et al Regarding Article, “Spectrum of Cardiac Manifestations in COVID-19: A Systematic Echocardiographic Study”",2021-03-02,"Mild to moderate COVID-19 can be found in about 80% of patients. Although mortality is low, mild to moderate COVID-19 may progress to severe or even critical stages in about one week. This poses a substantial burden on the health care system, and ultimately culminates in death or incapacitation and hospitalization. Therefore, pharmacological treatment is paramount for patients with this condition, especially those with recognized risk factors to disease progression. We conducted a comprehensive review in the medical literature searching for randomized studies carried out in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. A total of 14 randomized studies were identified, enrolling a total of 6848 patients. Nine studies (64%) were randomized, placebo-controlled trials, whereas five were open-label randomized trials (35%). We observed that Bamlanivimab and nitazoxanide reduced viral load, whereas ivermectin may have shortened time to viral clearance; Interferon Beta-1 reduced time to viral clearance and vitamin D reduced viral load; Favirapir, peginterferon, and levamisole improved clinical symptoms, whereas fluvoxamine halted disease progression; inhaled budesonide reduced the number of hospitalizations and visits to emergency departments; colchicine reduced the number of deaths and hospitalizations. Collectively, therefore, these findings show that treatment of early COVID-19 may be associated with reduced viral load, thus potentially decreasing disease spread in the community. Moreover, treatment of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 may also be associated with improved clinical symptoms, hospitalization, and disease progression. We suggest that colchicine, inhaled budesonide, and nitazoxanide, along with nonpharmacological measures, based on efficacy and costs, may be used to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in middle-income countries.","Bestetti, Reinaldo B.; Furlan-Daniel, Rosemary; Silva, Vinicius M.

673816,COVID-19 as the underlying cause of death: disentangling facts and values,2021-01-08,"Models of infectious disease spread that incorporate contact heterogeneity through contact networks are an important tool for epidemiologists studying disease dynamics and assessing intervention strategies. One of the challenges of contact network epidemiology has been the difficulty of collecting individual and population-level data needed to develop an accurate representation of the underlying host population's contact structure. In this study, we evaluate the utility of common epidemiological measures (R(0), epidemic peak size, duration and final size) for inferring the degree of heterogeneity in a population's unobserved contact structure through a Bayesian approach. We test the method using ground truth data and find that some of these epidemiological metrics are effective at classifying contact heterogeneity. The classification is also consistent across pathogen transmission probabilities, and so can be applied even when this characteristic is unknown. In particular, the reproductive number, R(0), turns out to be a poor classifier of the degree heterogeneity, while, unexpectedly, final epidemic size is a powerful predictor of network structure across the range of heterogeneity. We also evaluate our framework on empirical epidemiological data from past and recent outbreaks to demonstrate its application in practice and to gather insights about the relevance of particular contact structures for both specific systems and general classes of infectious disease. We thus introduce a simple approach that can shed light on the unobserved connectivity of a host population given epidemic data. Our study has the potential to inform future data-collection efforts and study design by driving our understanding of germane epidemic measures, and highlights a general inferential approach to learning about host contact structure in contemporary or historic populations of humans and animals.","Stack, J.

675467,[PROBLEMATIC ISSUES OF EQUIPPING SEA VESSELS IN TERMS OF STAFFING THE SHIP'S FIRST AID KIT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE NEW CORONAVIRUS INFECTION COVID-19].,2021-06-01,"In recent years severe infectious diseases have been constantly emerging, causing panic in the world. Now we know that many of these terrible diseases are caused by viruses originated from bats (Table 1), such as Ebola virus, Marburg, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV). These viruses have co-evolved with bats due to bats’ special social, biological and immunological features. Although bats are not in close contact with humans, spillover of viruses from bats to intermediate animal hosts, such as horses, pigs, civets, or non-human primates, is thought to be the most likely mode to cause human infection. Humans may also become infected with viruses through aerosol by intruding into bat roosting caves or via direct contact with bats, such as catching bats or been bitten by bats.","Han, Hui-Ju; Wen, Hong-ling; Zhou, Chuan-Min; Chen, Fang-Fang; Luo, Li-Mei; Liu, Jian-wei; Yu, Xue-Jie",Virus Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016817021500177X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25997928/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.05.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016817021500177X,814
