744,Understanding the clinical spectrum of complicated Plasmodium vivax malaria: a systematic review on the contributions of the Brazilian literature,2012-01-09,"The resurgence of the malaria eradication agenda and the increasing number of severe manifestation reports has contributed to a renewed interested in the Plasmodium vivax infection. It is the most geographically widespread parasite causing human malaria, with around 2.85 billion people living under risk of infection. The Brazilian Amazon region reports more than 50% of the malaria cases in Latin America and since 1990 there is a marked predominance of this species, responsible for 85% of cases in 2009. However, only a few complicated cases of P. vivax have been reported from this region. A systematic review of the Brazilian indexed and non-indexed literature on complicated cases of vivax malaria was performed including published articles, masters' dissertations, doctoral theses and national congresses' abstracts. The following information was retrieved: patient characteristics (demographic, presence of co-morbidities and, whenever possible, associated genetic disorders); description of each major clinical manifestation. As a result, 27 articles, 28 abstracts from scientific events' annals and 13 theses/dissertations were found, only after 1987. Most of the reported information was described in small case series and case reports of patients from all the Amazonian states, and also in travellers from Brazilian non-endemic areas. The more relevant clinical complications were anaemia, thrombocytopaenia, jaundice and acute respiratory distress syndrome, present in all age groups, in addition to other more rare clinical pictures. Complications in pregnant women were also reported. Acute and chronic co-morbidities were frequent, however death was occasional. Clinical atypical cases of malaria are more frequent than published in the indexed literature, probably due to a publication bias. In the Brazilian Amazon (considered to be a low to moderate intensity area of transmission), clinical data are in accordance with the recent findings of severity described in diverse P. vivax endemic areas (especially anaemia in Southeast Asia), however in this region both children and adults are affected. Finally, gaps of knowledge and areas for future research are opportunely pointed out.","Lacerda, Marcus VG; Mourão, Maria PG; Alexandre, Márcia AA; Siqueira, André M; Magalhães, Belisa ML; Martinez-Espinosa, Flor E; Santana Filho, Franklin S; Brasil, Patrícia; Ventura, Ana MRS; Tada, Mauro S; Couto, Vanja SCD; Silva, Antônio R; Silva, Rita SU; Alecrim, Maria GC",Malar J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3268102/,571
9453,CEPI—a new global R&D organisation for epidemic preparedness and response,2017-01-19,"BACKGROUND: Pendelluft, the movement of gas within different lung regions, is present in animal models of assisted mechanical ventilation and associated with lung overstretching. Due to rebreathing of CO(2) as compared to fresh gas, pendelluft might reduce ventilatory efficiency possibly exacerbating patient’s respiratory workload during weaning. Our aim was to measure pendelluft by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in patients who failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). METHODS: This is an observational study conducted in a general intensive care unit of a tertiary-level teaching hospital. EIT signal was recorded in 20 patients while pressure support (PS) ventilation was progressively reduced from clinical level (baseline) to 2 cmH(2)O, as in an SBT; four ventral-to-dorsal lung regions of interest were identified for pendelluft measurement. A regional gas movement (> 6 mL) occurring in a direction opposite to the global EIT signal was considered diagnostic for high pendelluft. RESULTS: Eight patients out of 20 (40%) were classified as high-pendelluft; baseline clinical characteristics did not differ between high- and low-pendelluft patients. At PS reduction, pendelluft and EtCO(2) increased more in the high-pendelluft group (p < .001 and .011, respectively). The volume of gas subject to pendelluft moved almost completely from the ventral towards the dorsal lung regions, while the opposite movement was minimal (16.3 [10:32.8] vs. 0 [0:1.8] mL, p = .001). In a subgroup of patients, increased pendelluft volumes positively correlated with markers of respiratory distress such as increased respiratory rate, p0.1, and EtCO(2). CONCLUSIONS: Occult pendelluft can be measured by EIT, and is frequently present in patients failing an SBT. When present, pendelluft increases with the reduction of ventilator support and is associated with increased EtCO(2), suggesting a reduction of the ability to eliminate CO(2).","Coppadoro, Andrea; Grassi, Alice; Giovannoni, Cecilia; Rabboni, Francesca; Eronia, Nilde; Bronco, Alfio; Foti, Giuseppe; Fumagalli, Roberto; Bellani, Giacomo",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7138895/,571

Despite advantages like efficiency and low cost, it has intrinsic technical limitations, such as the asymmetrical amplification of the library after each round of biopanning, which is regarded as a reason for it yielding a very limited number of antigen binders. In this study, we developed a high-throughput single-clonal screening system comprised of fluorescence immunoassays and a laser-driven clonal DNA retrieval system using microchip technology. Using this system, from a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) library displayed on phages with a complexity of 5.21 × 10(5) harboring random mutations at five amino acid residues, more than 70,000 clones—corresponding to ~14% of the library complexity—were screened, resulting in 78 antigen-reactive scFv sequences with mutations restricted to the randomized residues. Our results demonstrate that this system can significantly reduce the number of biopanning rounds, or even eliminate the need for this process for libraries with lower complexity, providing an opportunity to obtain more diverse clones from the library.","Chang, Seohee; Kim, Soohyun; Han, Jerome; Ha, Suji; Lee, Hyunho; Song, Seo Woo; Lee, Daewon; Kwon, Sunghoon; Chung, Junho; Kim, Junhoi",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7226094/,571

However, there is a lack of clear guidance for determining the sample size needed for phylogenetic studies, which are becoming an essential part of studying pathogen transmission. We introduce a statistical framework for determining the number of true infector-infectee transmission pairs identified by a phylogenetic study, given the size and population coverage of that study. We then show how characteristics of the criteria used to determine linkage and aspects of the study design can influence our ability to correctly identify transmission links, in sometimes counterintuitive ways. We test the overall approach using outbreak simulations and provide guidance for calculating the sensitivity and specificity of the linkage criteria, the key inputs to our approach. The framework is freely available as the R package phylosamp, and is broadly applicable to designing and evaluating a wide array of pathogen phylogenetic studies.","Wohl, Shirlee; Giles, John R.; Lessler, Justin",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8284614/,571
20298,A realist synthesis of websites containing content on perfectionism: Are the descriptions and advice empirically supported?,2021-08-25,"Bats serve as natural hosts of Pteropine orthoreovirus (PRV), an emerging group of bat-borne, zoonotic viruses. Bats appear to possess unique innate immune system responses that can inhibit viral replication, thus reducing clinical symptoms. We examined the innate immune response against PRV and assessed viral replication in cell lines derived from four bat species (Miniopterus fuliginosus, Pteropus dasymallus, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, and Rousettus leschenaultii), one rodent (Mesocricetous auratus), and human (Homo sapiens). The expression levels of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5) and interferons (IFNB1 and IFNL1) were higher and PRV replication was lower in cell lines derived from M. fuliginosus, R. ferrumequinum, and R. leschenaultii. Reduction of IFNB1 expression by the knockdown of PRRs in the cell line derived from R. ferrumequinum was associated with increased PRV replication. The knockdown of RIG-I led to the most significant reduction in viral replication for all cell lines. These results suggest that RIG-I production is important for antiviral response against PRV in R. ferrumequinum.

26782,Immunization and Vaccination,2019-05-16,"The objective of this chapter is to review and summarize the current economic estimates of influenza and the cost-effectiveness of its vaccines. We reviewed the published assessments of the economic costs of human seasonal and pandemic influenza internationally. Seasonal influenza costs Germany, France, and the USA between $4 and $87 billion annually. Depending upon the intensity of transmission and severity of disease, pandemic influenza may cause as many as 350 million deaths and result in economic losses topping $1 trillion – an impact great enough to create a worldwide recession. We then reviewed 100 papers primarily from more than a dozen countries which studied the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccine in children, adults, and the elderly. These studies demonstrate that influenza vaccination is quite cost-effective among children 6 months to 18 years old, in health care workers and pregnant women, and in high-risk individuals. Remarkably, compared with the other recently introduced vaccines for children, such as rotavirus and pneumococcal polysaccharide, vaccinating children and school attendees results in societal cost savings because it obviates lost productivity and wages among infected individuals and their caretakers. Vaccination for children is recommended in the USA and in Canada, but public health policy makers in Europe have undervalued this vaccine and not recommended it so widely.","Walsh, Julia A.; Maher, Cyrus",Influenza Vaccines for the Future,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123782/,571

In particular, the canonical inverse Lyndon factorization [Formula: see text], introduced in [5], maintains the main properties of the Lyndon factorization since it can be computed in linear time and it is uniquely determined. In this paper we investigate new properties of this factorization with the purpose of exploring its use in string queries. As a main result, we prove an upper bound on the length of the longest common extension (or longest common prefix) for two factors of a word w. This bound is at most the maximum length of two consecutive factors of [Formula: see text]. A tool used in the proof is a property that we state for factors with nonempty borders in [Formula: see text]: a nonempty border of a factor [Formula: see text] cannot be a prefix of the next factor [Formula: see text]. Another interesting result relates sorting of global suffixes, i.e., suffixes of a word w, and sorting of local suffixes, i.e., suffixes of the factors in [Formula: see text]. Finally, given a word w and a factor x of w, we prove that their Lyndon factorizations share factors, except for the first and last term of the Lyndon factorization of x. This property suggests that, given two words sharing a common overlap, their Lyndon factorizations could be used to capture the common overlap of these two words.","Bonizzoni, Paola; De Felice, Clelia; Zaccagnino, Rocco; Zizza, Rosalba",Language and Automata Theory and Applications,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206627/,571

33382,COVID‐19 and Union Prevention,2020-04-09,"Brain-inspired Hyperdimensional (HD) computing is an emerging technique for cognitive tasks in the field of low-power design. As an energy-efficient and fast learning computational paradigm, HD computing has shown great success in many real-world applications. However, an HD model incrementally trained on multiple tasks suffers from the negative impacts of catastrophic forgetting. The model forgets the knowledge learned from previous tasks and only focuses on the current one. To the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted to investigate the feasibility of applying multi-task learning to HD computing. In this paper, we propose Task-Projected Hyperdimensional Computing (TP-HDC) to make the HD model simultaneously support multiple tasks by exploiting the redundant dimensionality in the hyperspace. To mitigate the interferences between different tasks, we project each task into a separate subspace for learning. Compared with the baseline method, our approach efficiently utilizes the unused capacity in the hyperspace and shows a 12.8% improvement in averaged accuracy with negligible memory overhead.","Chang, Cheng-Yang; Chuang, Yu-Chuan; Wu, An-Yeu (Andy)",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7256401/,571

Some problems in cyber security such as logical vulnerability, risk assessment, policy validation etc. still require formal approach. In this paper we present the foundations of a new formal framework to address these challenges. Our approach is based on three-level formalisation: ontological, logical and analytical levels. Here we are presenting the first two levels which allow to model the security policies and provide a practical solution to the frame problem by efficient utilization of parameters as side effects. Key concepts are the situations, actions, events and rules. Our framework has potential use for analysis of a wide range of transactional systems within the financial, commercial and business domains and further work will include analytical level where we can perform vulnerability analysis of the model.","Bataityte, Karolina; Vassilev, Vassil; Gill, Olivia Jo",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7256421/,571

These have been realized through experiments that compare outcomes from a specified model (the correct model) with those from incorrect models which assume that the hypotheses are mutually exclusive or independent. The results show that PCM tracks the results of MPE more closely than ML when the degree of competition is greater than 0 and hence is able to infer explanations that are more likely to be true under such a condition. Experiments on the robustness of the measures with respect to incorrect model assumptions show that ML is more robust in general, but that MPE and PCM are more robust when the degree of competition is positive. The results also show that in general it is more reasonable to assume the hypotheses in question are independent than to assume they are mutually exclusive.","Huang, Jian-Dong; Glass, David H.; McCartney, Mark",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274706/,571
34117,Will COVID‐19 change how we prescribe?,2020-05-21,"Electroencephalography (EEG) studies produce region-referenced functional data in the form of EEG signals recorded across electrodes on the scalp. The high-dimensional data capture underlying neural dynamics and it is of clinical interest to model differences in neurodevelopmental trajectories between diagnostic groups, for example typically developing (TD) children and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In such cases, valid group-level inference requires characterization of the complex EEG dependency structure as well as covariate-dependent heteroscedasticity, such as changes in variation over developmental age. In our motivating study, resting state EEG is collected on both TD and ASD children aged two to twelve years old. The peak alpha frequency (PAF), defined as the location of a prominent peak in the alpha frequency band of the spectral density, is an important biomarker linked to neurodevelopment and is known to shift from lower to higher frequencies as children age. To retain the most amount of information from the data, we model patterns of alpha spectral variation, rather than just the peak location, regionally across the scalp and chronologically across development for both the TD and ASD diagnostic groups. We propose a covariate-adjusted hybrid principal components analysis (CA-HPCA) for region-referenced functional EEG data, which utilizes both vector and functional principal components analysis while simultaneously adjusting for covariate-dependent heteroscedasticity. CA-HPCA assumes the covariance process is weakly separable conditional on observed covariates, allowing for covariate-adjustments to be made on the marginal covariances rather than the full covariance leading to stable and computationally efficient estimation. A mixed effects framework is proposed to estimate the model components coupled with a bootstrap test for group-level inference. The proposed methodology provides novel insights into neurodevelopmental differences between TD and ASD children.","Scheffler, Aaron Wolfe; Dickinson, Abigail; DiStefano, Charlotte; Jeste, Shafali; Şentürk, Damla",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274738/,571
34205,A review of the impact of Covid‐19 corona virus on the oil sector,2020-05-26,"ABSTRACT: Preterm infants are a population at high risk for mortality and adverse health outcomes. With recent improvements in survival to childhood, increasing attention is being paid to risk of long-term morbidity, specifically during childhood and young-adulthood. Although numerous tools for predicting the functional outcomes of preterm neonates have been developed in the past three decades, no studies have provided a comprehensive overview of these tools, along with their strengths and weaknesses. The purpose of this article is to provide an in-depth, narrative review of the current risk models available for predicting the functional outcomes of preterm neonates. A total of 32 studies describing 43 separate models were considered. We found that most studies used similar physiologic variables and standard regression techniques to develop models that primarily predict the risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. With a recently expanded knowledge regarding the many factors that affect neurodevelopment and other important outcomes, as well as a better understanding of the limitations of traditional analytic methods, we argue that there is great room for improvement in creating risk prediction tools for preterm neonates. We also consider the ethical implications of utilizing these tools for clinical decision-making. IMPACT: Based on a literature review of risk prediction models for preterm neonates predicting functional outcomes, future models should aim for more consistent outcomes definitions, standardized assessment schedules and measurement tools, and consideration of risk beyond physiologic antecedents. Our review provides a comprehensive analysis and critique of risk prediction models developed for preterm neonates, specifically predicting functional outcomes instead of mortality, to reveal areas of improvement for future studies aiming to develop risk prediction tools for this population. To our knowledge, this is the first literature review and narrative analysis of risk prediction models for preterm neonates regarding their functional outcomes.","Crilly, Colin J.; Haneuse, Sebastien; Litt, Jonathan S.",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7276948/,571

A woman is considered to not have childbearing capacity if she is post-menopausal (minimum of 2 years without menstruation) or has undergone surgical sterilization (at least one month before the study). The trial is currently planned at a single center, Clínica Universidad de Navarra, in Navarra (Spain), and the immunology samples will be analyzed at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), in Barcelona (Spain). Participants will be recruited by the investigators at the emergency room and/or COVID-19 area of the CUN. They will remain in the trial for a period of 28 days at their homes since they will be patients with mild disease. In the interest of public health and to contain transmission of infection, follow-up visits will be conducted in the participant's home by a clinical trial team comprising nursing and medical members. Home visits will assess clinical and laboratory parameters of the patients. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Ivermectin will be administered to the treatment group at a 400μg/Kg dose (included in the EU approved label of Stromectol and Scabioral). The control group will receive placebo. There is no current data on the efficacy of ivermectin against the virus in vivo, therefore the use of placebo in the control group is ethically justified. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary Proportion of patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab at day 7 post-treatment. : 1. Mean viral load as determined by PCR cycle threshold (Ct) at baseline and on days 4, 7, 14, and 21. 2. Proportion of patients with fever and cough at days 4, 7, 14, and 21 as well as proportion of patients progressing to severe disease or death during the trial. 3. Proportion of patients with seroconversion at day 21. 4. Proportion of drug-related adverse events during the trial. 5. Median levels of IgG, IgM, IgA measured by Luminex, frequencies of innate and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells assessed by flow cytometry, median levels of inflammatory and activation markers measured by Luminex and transcriptomics. 6. Median kinetics of IgG, IgM, IgA levels during the trial, until day 28. RANDOMISATION: Eligible patients will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio using a randomization list generated by the trial statistician using blocks of four to ensure balance between the groups. A study identification code with the format “SAINT-##” (##: from 01 to 24) will be generated using a sequence of random numbers so that the randomization number does not match the subject identifier. The sequence and code used will be kept in an encrypted file accessible only to the trial statistician. A physical copy will be kept in a locked cabinet at the CUN, accessible only to the person administering the drug who will not enrol or attend to patient care. A separate set of 24 envelopes for emergency unblinding will be kept in the study file. BLINDING (MASKING): The clinical trial team and the patients will be blinded. The placebo will not be visibly identical, but it will be administered by staff not involved in the clinical care or participant follow up. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The sample size is 24 patients: 12 participants will be randomised to the treatment group and 12 participants to the control group. TRIAL STATUS: Current protocol version: 1.0 dated 16 of April 2020. Recruitment is envisioned to begin by May 14th and end by June 14th.

34632,A reflection on the mass production of scenarios in response to COVID‐19,2020-06-07,"We design and develop a new high performance implementation of a fast direct LU-based solver using low-rank approximations on massively parallel systems. The LU factorization is the most time-consuming step in solving systems of linear equations in the context of analyzing acoustic scattering from large 3D objects. The matrix equation is obtained by discretizing the boundary integral of the exterior Helmholtz problem using a higher-order Nyström scheme. The main idea is to exploit the inherent data sparsity of the matrix operator by performing local tile-centric approximations while still capturing the most significant information. In particular, the proposed LU-based solver leverages the Tile Low-Rank (TLR) data compression format as implemented in the Hierarchical Computations on Manycore Architectures (HiCMA) library to decrease the complexity of “classical” dense direct solvers from cubic to quadratic order. We taskify the underlying boundary integral kernels to expose fine-grained computations. We then employ the dynamic runtime system StarPU to orchestrate the scheduling of computational tasks on shared and distributed-memory systems. The resulting asynchronous execution permits to compensate for the load imbalance due to the heterogeneous ranks, while mitigating the overhead of data motion. We assess the robustness of our TLR LU-based solver and study the qualitative impact when using different numerical accuracies. The new TLR LU factorization outperforms the state-of-the-art dense factorizations by up to an order of magnitude on various parallel systems, for analysis of scattering from large-scale 3D synthetic and real geometries.","Al-Harthi, Noha; Alomairy, Rabab; Akbudak, Kadir; Chen, Rui; Ltaief, Hatem; Bagci, Hakan; Keyes, David",High Performance Computing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7295352/,571

In the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, we assessed whether those trained through these programmes were involved in the COVID-19 response and if so, in which area(s) of the emergency response they were applying their skills. Methods: From the records for each training programme, we identified the individuals who had completed training during the relevant timespan of each programme: 1999-2018 for the CRDF scheme, 2015-2020 for PGTS, and 2009-2019 for SORT-IT. Between March and April 2020, we sent trainees an online questionnaire by e-mail. Results: Out of 1254 trained, 1143 could be contacted and 699 responded to the survey. Of the latter, 411 were involved with the COVID-19 response, of whom 315 (77%) were applying their acquired skills in 85 countries. With some overlap between programmes, 84% of those trained through CRDF were applying their skills in 27 countries, 91% of those trained through PGTS were applying their skills in 19 countries, and through SORT IT, this was 73% in 62 countries. Skills were being applied in various areas of the emergency response, including: emergency preparedness, situation analysis/surveillance, infection control and clinical management, data generation, mitigating the effect of COVID on the health system, and research. Depending on the type of training programme, 26-74% were involved in implementation, operational or clinical research. Conclusion: Research training programmes build research capacity and equip health workers with transferable core competencies and skillsets prior to epidemics. This becomes invaluable in building health system resilience at a time of pandemics.","Zachariah, Rony; Maher, Dermot; Aseffa, Abraham; Vahedi, Mahnaz; Launois, Pascal; Khogali, Mohammed; Aslanyan, Garry; Reeder, John C.",F1000Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7308898/,571
35374,Tackling the COVID-19 challenge—a perspective from the CMA,2020-06-11,"SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus agent of the COVID-19 pandemic causing high mortalities. In contrast, the widely spread human coronaviruses OC43, HKU1, 229E, and NL63 tend to cause only mild symptoms. The present study shows, by in silico analysis, that these common human viruses are expected to induce immune memory against SARS-CoV-2 by sharing protein fragments (antigen epitopes) for presentation to the immune system by MHC class I. A list of such epitopes is provided. The number of these epitopes and the prevalence of the common coronaviruses suggest that a large part of the world population has some degree of specific immunity against SARS-CoV-2 already, even without having been infected by that virus. For inducing protection, booster vaccinations enhancing existing immunity are less demanding than primary vaccinations against new antigens. Therefore, for the discussion on vaccination strategies against COVID-19, the available immune memory against related viruses should be part of the consideration.","Dijkstra, Johannes M.; Hashimoto, Keiichiro",F1000Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7309412/,571

However, in the big data era, difficulties and volumes of data processing increase drastically. To decrease the huge computational cost, heuristic algorithms have been used. In this paper, an Adapting Chemotaxis Bacterial Foraging Optimization (ACBFO) algorithm is proposed based on basic Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) algorithm. The aim of this work is to design a modified algorithm which is more suitable for data classification. The proposed algorithm has two updating strategies and one structural changing. First, the adapting chemotaxis step updating strategy is responsible to increase the flexibility of searching. Second, the feature subsets updating strategy better combines the proposed heuristic algorithm with the KNN classifier. Third, the nesting structure of BFO has been simplified to reduce the computation complexity. The ACBFO has been compared with BFO, BFOLIW and BPSO by testing on 12 widely used benchmark datasets. The result shows that ACBFO has a good ability of solving classification problems and gets higher accuracy than the other comparation algorithm.","Wang, Hong; Ou, Yikun",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7354779/,571

38509,"Cultural commons: Critical responses to COVID-19, part 2",2020-08-30,"The WADA Code upholds the virtues of procedural fairness. Minimum procedural guarantees have been strengthened under the 2021 WADA Code and the International Standard for Results Management. However, implementation of these guarantees by National Anti-Doping Organizations (NADOs) and domestic anti-doping panels are critical in ensuring that athletes are afforded procedural fairness. While some countries have enacted reforms in anti-doping dispute resolution infrastructure, other jurisdictions are arguably lagging behind. Since few doping disputes are heard by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), a strong domestic dispute resolution framework should encourage independence, efficiency and cost-effectiveness, as well as promote consistency and procedural fairness at all levels of hearing. First instance hearings are particularly significant given that CAS is not considered a practical option for many athletes, especially those from developing countries, predominately due to challenges of access to justice and affordability. Irrespective of procedurally unfair decisions at first instance, CAS has the de novo right of review to correct any such irregularities. However, this approach alone is inadequate, especially given that most athletes do not appeal to CAS. CAS, WADA and NADOs all have significant roles to play in ensuring procedural fairness for athletes. WADA and NADOs need to do more to ensure compliance with procedural guarantees at first instance. This paper advances the debate on the importance of procedural fairness and proposes a research agenda to support future reform, arguing that the current anti-doping model needs to reconsider how these important standards are upheld, from first instance until final appeal.","Star, Shaun; Kelly, Sarah",Int Sports Law J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7453375/,571
38561,Marine fuels: Price impact of new 2020 low sulfur regulations negated by refineries and Covid‐19,2020-08-28,"BACKGROUND: Rhesus macaques are valuable pre-clinical models for malaria vaccine development. The Plasmodium knowlesi/rhesus and Plasmodium falciparum/rhesus models are two established platforms for malaria vaccine testing, and both have previously been used to assess live-attenuated sporozoite vaccines. However, there is evidence that the susceptibility of the rhesus liver to P. knowlesi versus P. falciparum sporozoites likely differs, potentially complicating comparisons between these two platforms. METHODS: To quantify the differing susceptibility of rhesus to P. knowlesi and P. falciparum sporozoites, animals were infected by direct venous inoculation of purified, cryopreserved wild-type P. knowlesi sporozoites (PkSPZ) or P. falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ). The entire liver was collected 5 days post-infection, and parasite burden in each liver lobe was quantified using an ultrasensitive Plasmodium 18S rRNA RT-PCR biomarker assay. The potential of using 18S rRNA copy number in the rhesus liver to directly measure the efficacy of vaccines targeting P. falciparum sporozoites and liver stages was also theoretically evaluated. RESULTS: Infection of rhesus with a high dose of PkSPZ led to consistently high burden liver stage infections (range 9.5–10.1 log(10) copies 18S rRNA/g of liver), with similar amounts of parasite 18S rRNA detected in every liver lobe. Inoculation of rhesus with high doses of PfSPZ led to more variable, lower liver burdens (range 4.9–6.6 log(10) copies 18S rRNA/g of liver in infected lobes), with parasite 18S rRNA below the limit of detection in some liver lobes. The low signal and heterogeneity of liver burden in the PfSPZ-infected animals indicates that even this extremely sensitive molecular assay cannot be used to assess reliably vaccine efficacy in the P. falciparum/rhesus platform. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of 18S rRNA in the liver following high dose intravenous PfSPZ confirmed that rhesus are modestly susceptible to wild-type P. falciparum sporozoites. However, comparison of 18S rRNA RT-PCR biomarker signal indicates that the P. falciparum liver burden was 3–5 logs lower than in PkSPZ-infected animals. Quantification of this difference in liver stage burden will help guide and interpret data from pre-clinical studies of live-attenuated sporozoite vaccines in rhesus models.","Shears, Melanie J.; Seilie, Annette M.; Kim Lee Sim, B.; Hoffman, Stephen L.; Murphy, Sean C.",Malar J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7457220/,571

METHODS: Adult patients with suspected infections were included. White blood cells, C‑reactive protein (CRP), and PCT were measured. RESULTS: In this study 129 patients of median age 64 years (interquartile range 39–89 years) were prospectively included. The Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores were 21 ± 14 and 7 ± 6, respectively. Intensive care unit (ICU) mortality was 22.5%. Immunocompromised patients constituted 39.5%. A significant correlation was observed between PCT and APACHE II (Spearman’s rho 0.461, p < 0.01), PCT and SOFA (Spearman’s rho 0.494, p < 0.01) and PCT and CRP (Spearman’s rho 0.403, p < 0.01). Most patients (n = 83, 64.3%) received antibiotics before admission. No difference in PCT (1.56 ± 8 µg/L vs. 1.44 ± 13 µg/L, p = 0.6) was observed with respect to previous antibiotic therapy. Levels of PCT and CRP were significantly increased in patients with positive blood cultures, the infection caused by Gram-negative microorganism regardless of disease severity and pneumonia with complications. PCT did not differ among patients with positive vs negative urine culture (4.6 ± 16 µg/L vs. 1.76 ± 11.9 µg/L) or positive vs. negative endotracheal aspirate (1.93 ± 11.4 µg/L vs. 1.76 ± 1.11 µg/L). PCT-guided stewardship was applied in 36 patients (28%). CONCLUSION: Increased initial PCT levels might point to the development of more severe disease caused by Gram-negative bacteria, regardless of previous antibiotic treatment. The results pertain to immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. Implementation of PCT-guided stewardship in those patients is possible and relies on experience as well as knowledge of reference change value for a marker within the specific setting.","Vujaklija Brajković, Ana; Košuta, Iva; Tomek, Dora; Rora, Mia; Babel, Jakša; Rogić, Dunja; Lončar Vrančić, Ana; Radonić, Radovan",Wien Klin Wochenschr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7538271/,571

A rapid assessment of public response toward the new status was conducted, focusing on perceived risk and panic buying. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional survey was conducted within 48 hours after the announcement through an online questionnaire. A demographic data including, sex, age, education, occupation (medical vs nonmedical), income, health insurance, island domicile (Java vs non-Java), mobility, history of contact with a foreigner, and history of overseas travel within a month. Knowledge regarding Covid 19 was determined by the average score of 38 5-Likert scale questions (5 indicates better knowledge). Perceived risk was measured with a 10-scale question, and panic buying was assessed through an average score of 6 5-Likert scale questions (5 indicates panic buying). Mann-Whitney and Linear regression were performed to identify the associated factors. RESULTS: As a total of 214 respondents, panic buying was lower (2.28 ± 0.79 on a 5-scale) except for perceived risk (5.91 ± 2.13 on a 10-scale). No difference between medical and nonmedical staff in panic buying (p = 0.619) and perceived risk (p = 0.477) and the domicile of respondents (Java VS nonjava) in panic buying (p = 0.810) and perceived risk (p = 0.101). Younger age, working in a medical field and living in Java are associated with higher perceived risk in the linear model whereas panic buying is solely affected by knowledge (β -1.459. p < 0.001). The respondents agreed that scarcity of single-use components (mean 4.32 out of 5) such as masker and goods inflation particularly groceries (mean 4.31 out of 5) will appear soon CONCLUSIONS: It is important to disseminate the correct information to the public to reduce panic buying. Collaborative action between the government and medical staff should be done particularly in Java as the first locus of CoVid 19 in Indonesia. KEY MESSAGES: Knowledge regarding corona virus affects the Panic Buying. An intervention to disseminate the correct information should be done.

We discuss existing challenges and future opportunities in the use of cell-free systems for the design, manufacture, and study of glycoprotein biomedicines.","Hershewe, Jasmine; Kightlinger, Weston; Jewett, Michael C.",J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7578589/,571
41423,Sanitization During and After COVID-19 Pandemic: A Short Review,2020-11-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSES: Thailand has implemented a nationwide insurance policy for migrants, namely the Health Insurance Card Scheme (HICS), for a long time. However, numerous implementation challenges remain and migrant perspectives on the policy are rarely known. The aim of this study was to examine migrant service users’ perspectives and their consequent response towards the HICS. METHODS: A qualitative case-study approach was employed. In-depth interviews with ten local migrants and four employers were conducted in one of the most densely migrant-populated provinces in Thailand. Document review was used as a means for data triangulation. Inductive thematic analysis was exercised on interview data. RESULTS: The findings revealed that most migrants were not aware of the benefit, they are entitled to receive from the HICS due to unclear communication and inadequate announcements about the policy. The registration costs needed for legalising migrants’ precarious status were a major concern. Adequate support from employers was a key determining factor that encouraged migrants to participate in the registration process and purchase the insurance card. Some employers sought assistance from private intermediaries or brokers to facilitate the registration process for migrants. CONCLUSION: Proper communication and promotion regarding the benefits of the HICS and local authorities taking action to expedite the registration process for migrants are recommended. The policy should also establish a mechanism to receive feedback from migrants. This will help resolve implementation challenges and lead to further improvement of the policy.","Srisai, Patinya; Phaiyarom, Mathudara; Suphanchaimat, Rapeepong",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7585867/,571

METHODS: We reviewed pediatric patients receiving tandem TPE and CKRT from 2013 to 2016. Over the study period, 63 discrete patients received tandem TPE and CKRT for a total of 378 TPE procedures on 1676 days on CKRT. RESULTS: Patient age ranged from newborn to 19 years old with weights ranging from 2.31 to 112.3 kg (17 patients were < 10 kg and less than 1 year old). All procedures were completed in intensive care units (ICU) as CKRT can only be done in this environment. All treatments completed successfully; majority of patients (90%) developed hypocalcemia though none were symptomatic. Case mortality rate was 40%. Disease severity scores at ICU admission were higher and time to TPE and CKRT start was longer in the deceased group. CONCLUSIONS: As a conclusion, though complications including hypocalcemia are common with tandem TPE and CKRT in pediatrics, patients remained asymptomatic. Such treatments have to be carefully planned with interdisciplinary teams to address indications, technicalities, and complications.","Tufan Pekkucuksen, Naile; Sigler, Katie E.; Akcan Arikan, Ayse; Srivaths, Poyyapakkam",Pediatr Nephrol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7588944/,571

41749,"Parasocial Interaction, the COVID-19 Quarantine, and Digital Age Media",2020-11-07,"BACKGROUND: Teaching and assessing clinical procedures requires a clear delineation of the individual steps required to successfully complete the procedure. For decades, human reliability analysis (HRA) has been used to identify the steps required to complete technical procedures in higher risk industries. However, the use of HRA is uncommon in healthcare. HRA has great potential supporting simulation-based education (SBE) in two ways: (1) to support training through the identification of the steps required to complete a clinical procedure; and (2) to support assessment by providing a framework for evaluating performance of a clinical procedure. The goal of this study was to use HRA to identify the steps (and the risk associated with each of these steps) required to complete a bronchoscope-assisted percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (BPDT). BPDT is a potentially high-risk minimally invasive procedure used to facilitate tracheostomy placement at the bedside or in the operating theatre. METHODS: The subgoals, or steps, required to complete the BPDT procedure were identified using hierarchical task analysis. The Systematic Human Error Reduction and Prediction Approach (SHERPA) was then used to identify potential human errors at each subgoal, the level of risk and how these potential errors could be prevented. RESULTS: The BPDT procedure was broken down into 395 subgoals, of which 18% were determined to be of high-risk. The most commonly identified remediation strategies for reducing the risk of the procedure included: checklist implementation and audit, statutory and mandatory training modules, simulation training, consultant involvement in all procedures, and fostering a safety-focused hospital culture. CONCLUSION: This study provides an approach for how to systematically identify the steps required to complete a clinical procedure for both training and assessment. An understanding of these steps is the foundation of SBE. HRA can identify ‘a correct way’ for teaching learners how to complete a technical procedure, and support teachers to give systematic and structured feedback on performance.","Lavelle, Aoife; White, Mary; Griffiths, Mark J.D.; Byrne, Dara; O’Connor, Paul",Adv Simul (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7643084/,571
41916,Racial Disparities in Homicide Victimisation Rates: How to Improve Transparency by the Office of National Statistics in England and Wales,2020-11-10,"BACKGROUND: Continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) is an important neuromonitoring tool in brain injured patients. It is commonly used for detection of seizure but can also be used to monitor changes in cerebral blood flow. One such event that can cause a change in cerebral blood flow is imminent, cerebral herniation. cEEG monitoring and quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) can be used as neurotelemetry to detect cerebral herniation prior to onset of clinical signs. CASE PRESENTATION: We discuss two cases highlighting the use of cEEG in cerebral herniation accompanied by clinical examination changes. The first case is a patient with multiorgan failure and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Given his coagulopathy status, his ICH expanded. The second case is a patient with intraventricular hemorrhage and worsening obstructive hydrocephalus. In both cases, the cEEG showed increasing regional/lateralized slowing. The Quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) showed a decrease in frequencies, worsening asymmetry, decreasing amplitude and increasing burst suppression ratio corresponding with the ongoing herniation. Clinically, these changes on cEEG preceded the bedside neurological changes by up to 1 h. CONCLUSIONS: The use of cEEG to monitor patients at high risk for herniation syndromes may identify changes earlier than bedside clinical exam. This earlier identification may allow for an earlier opportunity to intervene.","Mullaguri, Naresh; Beary, Jonathan M.; Newey, Christopher R.",BMC Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7647882/,571

In particular, older adults in residential and community-based facilities are at greater risks of contracting COVID-19, in part due to close proximities and frequent human interactions in these facilities. In Singapore, the Ministry of Health and its implementation agency, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), together with long-term care service providers, have jointly developed a number of precautionary measures against COVID-19. This paper defines and describes Singapore’s response in terms of the ‘ABC’ of COVID-19 safety measures for facilities, namely, safe Access, Behaviors, Compounds (i.e. spatial surroundings). These included infection prevention and control measures, access to PPE, distancing and zoning measures, suspension of visitors, alternative accommodation for long-term care workers, and testing to monitor people with long-term care needs and care workers. Incident response teams to support facilities providers in responding to COVID-19 infections were also swiftly set up. The outreach arm of AIC, the Silver Generation Office, further provided information and services support to older people during the pandemic.

As part of a broader, ongoing study assessing states’ AL regulations regarding medical and mental health care for residents with Alzheimer’s and related dementias (ADRD), stakeholders across the United States were recruited in July and August 2020 for semi-structured interviews to provide their perspectives on AL policies and practices specific to COVID-19 response. Stakeholders (n=32) consisted of state healthcare and trade association representatives, clinical practitioners, operators, researchers, and dementia care experts experienced in AL-related operational, healthcare, and regulatory affairs. Using thematic analysis, we describe several emerging topics regarding the opportunities, challenges, and innovations of responding to COVID-19 within the unique context of AL. States’ public health responses to COVID-19 lacked an understanding of the broader long-term care system, especially AL’s scope and purpose, workforce, capacity to implement infection control practices and policies, and unintended consequences of social isolation for older adults, specifically residents living in dementia care units. Despite these challenges, stakeholders described opportunities to expand telehealth infrastructure, communication and collaboration across states and among operators, and several innovations to mitigate the effects of social isolation. It is imperative for policymakers to understand the nuances of the AL context and design regulations and public health responses grounded in a whole-person perspective and in partnership with operators during, and beyond, pandemic circumstances.","Dys, Sarah; Winfree, Jaclyn; Carder, Paula; Dugle, Kaylin; Zimmerman, Sheryl; Thomas, Kali",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7741593/,571

However, clinical features and outcome of COVID-19 in patients with liver injury remain to be further investigated. In this study, the clinical data of 265 COVID-19 patients admitted to seven tertiary hospitals were collected. Based on a threshold for transaminase or total bilirubin levels at two times the normal upper limit, patients were divided into mild or moderate/severe liver injury groups. Among the 265 patients, 183 patients showed liver injury within 48 hours of admission. Aspartate aminotransferase levels were predominantly elevated in the liver injury group, but albumin levels were reduced. Moreover, fibrinogen and D-dimer were significantly increased. Furthermore, 68% of the patients with moderate/severe liver injury had one or more underlying diseases. Almost half of these patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (44%) and secondary infections (46%). These patients showed increased interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 levels and a decrease in PaO(2) and the oxygenation index. In addition, levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and albumin were correlated with the oxygenation index, D-dimer and lymphocyte counts. Furthermore, a novel prognostic assessment model based on liver function was established, which accuracy reached 88% and was able to accurately assess the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.","Pan, Tongtong; Chen, Dazhi; Pan, Chenwei; Kang, Yi; Liu, Junping; Su, Feifei; Hong, Liang; Li, Huili; Zhao, Hui; Lin, Zhuo; Wang, Xiaodong; Lin, Hongwei; Du, Qianjing; Cai, Chao; Chen, Yongping",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7769056/,571
44176,Regime specific spillover across cryptocurrencies and the role of COVID-19,2021-01-06,"BACKGROUND: Data early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic suggested frontline healthcare workers (HCW) may account for 10–20% of all infections. CDC estimated 600,000 infections in HCWs. Symptom screening is a strategy to prevent healthcare-associated transmission. This method may not identify asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriers. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic healthcare workers in a 1541-bed academic medical center. Although recruitment began in designated COVID-19 units, we expanded to all HCWs providing care to hospitalized patients during the pandemic. Data was gathered on demographics, work area in the hospital and daily questionnaires were sent listing symptoms of SARS-CoV-2. Protocol included twice weekly self-collected nasopharyngeal swab and saliva for SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2.Those with positive PCR result, underwent telephone survey to assess symptomatology and severity of illness. RESULTS: A total 525 HCWs began the study protocol and 16 were identified as PCR positive. Samples included concordant saliva and NP samples on 9 (56%), exclusively NP samples on 5 (31%) and 2 (12%) HCWs were positive by saliva PCR only. Majority were female, and all were nursing staff; with 19% reported not working in a designated COVID-19 unit. During the course of this active surveillance, universal masking was mandated in the institution. Rhinorrhea and headache were reported by 6 (38%), 5 (31%) reported cough and 3 (19%) developed myalgia. Changes in smell and taste preceded the positive PCR test in 2 (12%). One HCW reported developing a fever with acute illness. All were notified about their PCR positive status by institution’s occupational health department and self-isolated to monitor for symptoms. CONCLUSION: The spectrum of disease in this HCW cohort is similar to mild disease in the community. Due to high incidence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic HCWs, active surveillance with routine testing proves be beneficial to prevent hospital transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Universal masking significantly decreased the HCW positive rate in our study, underscoring the need for universal efforts to mitigate healthcare-associated transmission with self-monitoring, face mask use, and other infection prevention behaviors like hand hygiene.

The aim of our study was to determine the relationship between COPD and abundant microaspiration in intubated critically ill patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data, provided by 3 randomized controlled trials on microaspiration in critically ill patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h. Abundant microaspiration was defined as the presence of pepsin and or alpha-amylase at significant levels in tracheal aspirates. In all study patients, pepsin and alpha-amylase were quantitatively measured in all tracheal aspirates collected during a 48-h period. COPD was defined using spirometry criteria. RESULTS: Among the 515 included patients, 70 (14%) had proven COPD. Pepsin and alpha-amylase were quantitatively measured in 3873 and 3764 tracheal aspirates, respectively. No significant difference was found in abundant microaspiration rate between COPD and non-COPD patients (62 of 70 patients (89%) vs 366 of 445 (82%) patients, p = 0.25).

Acknowledging the many material and social benefits of a global regime of free market urbanism built on advances in science and technology, this is a point in geohistory, the Anthropocene, when the impact of human activities on the Earth has begun to outcompete natural processes. The coronavirus has illuminated systemic moral failures and new moral challenges of the Anthropocene that call for adaptive response if we are to build a hopeful future for humanity and the planet. Pointing to millennia of human adaptive response to threats and disasters, the author asserts an evolutionary hardiness attributable as much to moral capacities as rational intelligence as a singularly defining trait fueling millennia of human adaptive learning and thrival. The current pandemic is the latest point in humanity’s moral evolution of adaptive response to moments of urgent threat that have tested, expanded, and defined our character and moral capacities as a species. Rather than falter under the moral burden of the coronavirus threat and its consequences, the author views this pivotal point as an opportunity to stretch human moral horizons by taking responsibility for the urgent moral challenges we have created and inventing new ethical frameworks and tools that will lead us to new moral understandings and solutions to the moral challenges we face.","Thompson, Lindsay J.",Mind Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7868169/,571

To understand this process in the field of journalism, we unpacked discourses concerning the coronavirus pandemic collected from interviews with journalists during the pandemic and from the U.S. journalism trade press using the Discourses of Journalism Database. Through discourse analysis, we discovered that during COVID-19 journalists discursively placed themselves in a responsible but vulnerable position within the communication ecology—not solely as a result of the pandemic but also from environmental conditions that long preceded it.

45769,Art and dementia education in times of COVID‐19: Developing topics,2020-12-07,"INTRODUCTION: The recent COVID-19 pandemic saw many patients admitted to an intensive care setting and requiring mechanical ventilation. The NHS increased their critical care beds which included expanding the amount of staff. Physiotherapists were a key part of this and were required to complete numerous interventions within the COVID critical care setting throughout the pandemic. Our aim was to collect the incidence and frequency of physiotherapy interventions performed during the COVID-19 pandemic in a critical care setting. METHOD: Data was collected across all critical care beds at the Royal London Hospital for an eight-week period between March- April 2020. We retrospectively collected physiotherapy interventions for example, endotracheal suctioning and functional rehabilitation for every patient in the critical care setting. The Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment Tool (CPAx) scores were also obtained for patients on ACCU admission and discharge. RESULTS: A total of 213 patients were included in the sample, 163 COVID-19 positive and 50 COVID-19 negative. Recorded sessions included secretion management (821), weaning (271), rescue therapy (82) and functional rehab (534) across the eight-week period. The mean CPAx score on admission to ACCU for the entire sample was 9/45 points. On discharge that score had improved to 25/45 points. CONCLUSION: This unique project has enabled us to report on the critical care physiotherapy interventions provided during the COVID 19 pandemic. This interesting data on frequency and timing of interventions may be useful to plan future relocation staffing plans and optimal allocation of care.","Rich, Jessica; Coman, Mark; Sharkey, Alison; Church, Daniel; Pawson, Jessica; Thomas, Amanda",J Intensive Care Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7873622/,571

When the UV mutagenesis time was 25 s, the positive mutation rate was the highest at 26.60%. The NRA of the obtained positive mutant UV-11 was 9.21 mM NO(2)(−)/mg dry weight, and the activity was found to be 1.04-fold higher than that of the original strain S. simulans D14. A Plackett–Burman design (PBD) was employed to screen the significant variables pH, KNO(3) (%) and incubation time (h), and response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the significant variables using a Box–Behnken design (BBD). The results showed that the NRA of S. simulans UV-11 was 15.22 mM NO(2)(−)/mg dry weight under optimum conditions of 37 °C, pH 6.5, incubation time 15 h, KNO(3) 0.045%, NaCl 5%, NaNO(2) 0.015%, peptone 1%, and D–mannitol 1%, which increased by 65.2% compared with the unoptimized medium. Natural curing agents (containing 10(7) CFU/g S. simulans UV-11 under optimal conditions and 1.40% celery powder, T2) were added to the cured meat model. T2 produced significantly lighter and redder signals than the control group (C) and the addition of 150 ppm NaNO(2) group (T1). The thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) of T2 was 2.30 mg malonaldehyde/kg product and residual nitrite of T2 was 7.1 ppm after 14 days of storage,which were lower than those groups of C and T1. Taking into account the results of cured meat models, S. simulans UV-11 could be selected as a potential starter culture for the processing of natural meat products.","Sun, Mengjie; Ning, Xibin",Food Measure,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7875452/,571

We use the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) and asymmetric Baba–Engle–Kraft–Kroner (BEKK) GARCH models to calculate the time-varying correlations of these two markets and examine the return and volatility spillover effects between these two markets. The empirical results show that there are only unidirectional return spillovers from the U.S. stock market to the Chinese stock market. The U.S. stock market has a consistently positive spillover to China’s next day’s morning trading, but its impact on China’s next day’s afternoon trading appears to be insignificant. This finding implies that information in the U.S. stock market impacts the performance of the Chinese stock market differently in distinct semi-day trading. Moreover, with respect to the volatility, there are significant bidirectional spillover effects between these two markets.","Chen, Yifan; Yu, Limin; Gang, Jianhua",Front,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7887722/,571
46258,"The Human, Economic, Social, and Political Costs of COVID-19",2021-03-03,"Background: Children with chronic physical health conditions are up to six times more likely to develop a mental health condition than their physically well peers. Frontline pediatric hospital staff are in a good position to identify mental health problems and facilitate appropriate support for patients. To date, no evaluation of mental health literacy training has taken place with this professional group to enable early identification of difficulties. It is also not known whether face-to-face or digital training is more effective or preferable in this setting. To improve the skills of frontline hospital staff, a face-to-face and digital mental health literacy training course was delivered using MindEd content and evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. Method: Two-hundred and three frontline staff across different professions from a tertiary pediatric hospital were randomized to a face-to-face (n = 64), digital (n = 71), or waitlist control group (n = 68). Face-to-face training was two and a half hours and digital training took ~1 h. The effects of training were evaluated pre- and post-training and at two-week follow-up. Questionnaires assessed mental health knowledge, stigma, confidence in recognizing concerns and knowing what to do, actual helping behavior, as well as training delivery preference, completion rate, and satisfaction. Results: Both face-to-face and digital training increased mental health knowledge, confidence in recognizing mental health problems and knowing what to do compared to waitlist controls. Digital training increased actual helping behavior relative to the waitlist controls and stigma decreased across all groups. Staff were satisfied with both delivery methods but preferred face-to-face training. Conclusions: The results provide promising findings that digital content is an effective way of improving mental health literacy in frontline pediatric hospital staff. Providing digital training could be a time-efficient way of upskilling non-mental health professionals to identify mental health needs in a pediatric population and facilitate access to appropriate care.","O'Connell, Jennifer; Shafran, Roz; Pote, Helen",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7905032/,571

The present study used CONTAM simulations to investigate the intra-building transport and concentration of an inert pollutant continuously emitted from an underground garage of a 15-floor building under moderate Mediterranean weather. The effects of outdoor meteorological conditions (air temperature, wind speed and direction) on indoor distribution of the emitted pollutant was tested under constant conditions. The importance of using actual transient meteorological data and the impact of their temporal resolution on calculated concentrations and exposure levels were also investigated. Vertical profiles of air exchange rate (AER) and CO concentration were shown to be sensitive to indoor-outdoor temperature difference, which controls the extent of the stack effect and its importance relative to wind effect. Even under constant conditions, transient mode simulations revealed that the time needed for pollutant distribution to reach steady state can be quite long (>24h in some cases). The temporal resolution (1h vs. 8h) of the meteorological data input was also found to impact calculated exposure levels, in an extent that varied with time, meteorological conditions and apartment position.","Reichman, Rivka; Dubowski, Yael",Build Simul,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7905197/,571

They are responsible for conducting the first step in the protein biosynthesis, namely attaching amino acids to the corresponding tRNA molecules both in cytoplasm and mitochondria. More and more research demonstrates that mutations in the genes encoding aaRSs lead to the development of various neurodegenerative diseases, such as incurable Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) and distal spinal muscular atrophy. Some mutations result in the loss of tRNA aminoacylation activity, while other mutants retain their classical enzyme activity. In the latter case, disease manifestations are associated with additional neuron-specific functions of aaRSs. At present, seven aaRSs (GlyRS, TyrRS, AlaRS, HisRS, TrpRS, MetRS, and LysRS) are known to be involved in the CMT etiology with glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS) being the most studied of them.","Vinogradova, Ekaterina S.; Nikonov, Oleg S.; Nikonova, Ekaterina Yu.",Biochemistry (Mosc),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7905983/,571

At various times in history, numbers have been used to assess the overall strength of the population, to identify the march of dangerous contagion, or to determine needs for food or labor. But even simple counting of population numbers, vital statistics, or reports of disease has been controversial. Information is power and the most rudimentary surveillance can be used both for good and for harm. This chapter sets ethical questions about these basic surveillance methods in historical and epistemological context. It gives examples of uses of data about population numbers, vital statistics, or outbreaks that have been clearly beneficial, as well as examples that have bordered on the genocidal. Counting numbers, as a rudimentary epidemiological method, also presents the opportunity to explore ethical problems raised by epidemiology as a science, such as incomplete data, biased data, or false negatives or positives. Today, with increasing understanding of disease and availability of prevention or treatment, the advantages of outbreak detection may be shared far more widely and more equally. Nonetheless, outbreak detection can generate fear and hostility if patterns of disease track otherwise disfavored groups. COVID-19 has revealed the importance of demographic data about the distribution of disease burdens—data that may either generate mistrust as people see their disadvantage starkly, or that may foster trust if the result is increased attention to disparities in treatment and in health.","Francis, John G.; Francis, Leslie P.",Sustaining Surveillance: The Importance of Information for Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972152/,571

Still, only few works have tried to present a bird’s-eye perspective on current debates, combining original philosophical positions with relevant technological developments and scientific paradigms. Based on an interdisciplinary definition of human nature, this paper explores three dimensions to better understand and categorize views of human nature and technology: first, the natural constitution of human beings; second, the position of human beings within their environment; and third, human values. It discusses how different accounts of human nature result in different views of the role of technology by reviewing perspectives of the human body and technological enhancement as well as accounts of the human as an isolated individual or social being. Human values are presented along five dimensions, covering individual, social, environmental, technical, and economic aspects, which play unique roles in the human-technology relation. While this paper can only offer a preliminary analysis of positions and arguments, it concludes with challenges of a dualist view of the human and technology and motivates further investigations of the human-technology relation. A better understanding of implicit beliefs regarding humans and technology can inform research and practice in the fields of technology ethics, design, and engineering and can open up space for a positive reconceptualization both of what it means to be human and the role of technology.","Bednar, Kathrin",Human-Centric Computing in a Data-Driven Society,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978987/,571

This article examines an unlikely victim of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global regime for the governance of international trade, and does so from an African perspective. Following the proliferation of national measures restricting the export of COVID-19-essential personal protective equipment and other medical products at a time when trade literally can mean saving lives, this article asks whether import-dependent countries such as most states in Africa can rely on the multilateral trading system to secure access to these life-saving equipment and supplies. Answering this question in the negative, the article argues that those African countries that lack domestic manufacturing capacity—which make up the majority on the Continent—need to rethink their commodity-export-dependent development strategy and refocus on industrialisation backed up with adequate research and development capacity. Finally, the article also suggests that States Parties to the AfCFTA Agreement should use this period as a window of opportunity to revisit the text of the Agreement so a revised AfCFTA has a better chance of coping with the next pandemic or emergency.","Desta, Melaku Geboye",Ethiopian Yearbook of International Law 2019,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979037/,571

Corporate social responsibility is well defined and integrated in the mindsets of companies in developed countries. In Africa, there is a growing understanding of the role of CSR and the need to integrate them into national policies. This chapter reviews global and African practices in CSR; in the case of Ethiopia, determinants of CSR practices are identified and discussed. The methodology employed to conduct this brief study is a review of reports and research written on corporate social responsibility. Accordingly, 30 reports were assessed. The findings established that the predominant culture in Ethiopia is one of philanthropy rather than CSR. It is very common for companies to contribute to community development activities, grand projects of the government and relief support in times of natural disasters. Systemic integration of CSR into company strategies and business planning is not visible even in the largest corporations. There is also a policy gap on the government’s part as there are no clearly defined policies and strategies towards encouraging CSR.","Kellow, Ahmed; Kellow, Nebil",Doing Business in Africa,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979071/,571
50141,Value chain management under COVID-19: responses and lessons from grape production in India,2021-03-24,"The ongoing pandemic of viral infections due to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is known to have affected about 8,240,000 people globally and approximately 3,67,000 people in India as of June 19, 2020. The pandemic being quite persistent in nature, timely planning for novel and adaptive interventions are required for dealing with it, with a view to detecting the early signs of infection, as well as, controlling the spread of the outbreak towards the uninfected population residing at comparatively safer zones. In general, the coronaviruses belong to a group of RNA viruses that are known to infect a wide range of hosts including humans, other mammals and birds, with the clinical courses in the infected hosts ranging from being asymptomatic to showing acute symptoms in the respiratory, digestive and genital organs. Although the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is reported to spread primarily through inter-personal physical contacts rather than the faecal-oral route, evidence of gastrointestinal symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections accompanied by the detection of viral RNA in the faeces of infected individuals, with high probability of their presence in wastewater samples, makes an important case for the thorough characterization and quantification of the pathogenic materials present in the municipal sludge generated in urban centres. This becomes even more important in the case of the metro cities and dense urban centres, where the chance of the medical wastes from the COVID hospital facilities coming into the municipal sewage stream is highly likely. However, the pathogens in the municipal sewage stream become concentrated in the sludge, providing an opportunity to treat the separated sludge from the wastewater stream using a technology of irradiation called ‘sludge hygienisation’ to curb the outbreak of the virus. The present work provides an assessment of the sludge hygienisation technology for its suitability as an option to eradicate the viral particles accumulated in the sludge samples from urban environments that are presumably infected through the faecal deposition, as well as, due to uncurbed release of untreated biomedical wastes. Such an intervention will provide suitable means to control rapid viral outbreak that might be attributed to the high volumetric flow rate of the municipal sewage. Investment in such novel interventions, given the current circumstances, will be important to contain present and future outbreaks, ensuring that the community healthcare systems are saved from being pushed to the limits owing to the increasing pressure on the infrastructure that arises from the rapidly growing number of infected individuals.","Majumdar, Rudrodip",The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Green Societies,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7984811/,571

We built a vibrant middle class in the post-war era because we started to tear down many of the barriers that had kept women of all races and men of color from contributing their full talents. A quarter of the growth in aggregate output from 1960 to 2010 can be explained by improved allocation of talent. We didn't finish the work. We allowed barriers to opportunity to return, or new ones to grow up. This turned out to be a tragedy, not only for those people who lost their livelihoods, but also for the economy. Policy can make a difference. The Civil Rights Act really did make a huge difference in the opportunities and gains for Black Americans and for women. Subsequent advancements in automation and trade, which left a lot of workers behind, were not accompanied by changes in policy to help those workers adapt. One thing that we know is that, especially in laboratories or patent teams where people are working together, equality of opportunity is much more than just getting things like as many job interviews. Women and underrepresented minorities are not pulled in and kept in the same way as others. We may, in fact, as a society be underinvesting in the people who could be creating the companies that would be creating the jobs that put those people to better use.

51151,COVID‐19 makes clear why deinstitutionalization is essential,2021-01-15,"BACKGROUND: In March 2020, the World Health Organization announced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic, and because of the primary pulmonary manifestations of the disease, chest CT is essential in the evaluation of those patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of chest CT findings and chest CT scoring along with serum ferritin and LDH in the prognosis of COVID-19 patients in a cohort of the Egyptian population. RESULTS: This retrospective study included 250 patients with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19, 138 males [55.2%] and 112 females [44.8%], age range 17–82 years with median 49.5. Two hundred patients had a positive significant correlation between age, serum ferritin, serum LDH, and CT score. Bilateral affection was 88% while unilaterality was 12%, and peripheral chest CT findings were stratified as follows: mild [score from 1 to 10], 114 patients [57%]; moderate [score from 11 to 19], 65 patients [32.5%]; and severe [score from 20 to 25], 21 patients [10.5%]. In severe cases, males constitute 85.7% while females were only 14.3%. Statistical and central distribution was 67%, peripheral was 31%, and central was 2%. Ground glass opacity (GGO) was the highest pattern 39.2%, consolidation 31.2%, fibrosis 15.2%, and CP 13.7%, with lymph nodes only 0.6%. Fifteen cases [6%] were critical; all showed severe scores ranging from 21 to 23 with three times increase in serum ferritin and four times increase in LDH. A follow-up study done to 8 cases [3.2%] showed an increase in CT scoring, serum ferritin, and serum LDH. CONCLUSION: Chest CT findings are crucial for early diagnosis of COVID-19 disease especially for asymptomatic patients with old age and male sex considered risk factors for poor prognosis. Chest CT score, serum ferritin, and serum LDH help in predicting the short-term outcome of the patients aiming to decrease both morbidity and mortality.","El Bakry, Rehab Abdel Rahman; Sayed, Ayman Ibrahim Tharwat",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8008217/,571
51170,Complexity and COVID‐19: Leadership and Followership in a Complex World,2021-03-18,"The review presents an analysis of the scientific data on the characteristics of COVID-19 from the perspective of potential interactions between the virus and the host genome retroelements. According to global statistical data, severe COVID-19 with immune-system hyperactivity is observed mainly in elderly people. At the same time, aging is characterized by a decrease in immune responses. This paradox may be resolved by the assumption that DNA regions that can move along the genome with the “copy and paste” mechanism (retroelements) may play a role in COVID-19 development; these elements are characterized by abnormal expression patterns in aging. Their interaction with SARS-CoV-2 may occur at the level of RNA interference or RNA recombination, or the virus can use retroelement proteins to integrate into the host genome. There is supporting evidence of this interaction: data indicating the efficiency of antiretroviral drugs at the early stage of COVID-19, the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 for a long time after recovery, the persistence of coronavirus infections, and changes in the L1 retrotransposon expression patterns in the lung tissues of COVID-19 patients. In additional, retroelements affect the functioning of the immune system and affect the receptors interacting with SARS-CoV-2. Recombination with retroelements and viral insertions into host genomes have been demonstrated in the case of other infections caused by nonretroviral, RNA-containing viruses. The presumable interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and retroelements may explain the differences in the severity and lethality of COVID-19 in different countries as a result of specific insertional patterns in the genomes of individuals belonging to different human populations. The possible insertion of SARS-CoV-2 cDNA into the genome should be kept in mind in the design of anti-COVID-19 vaccines. Peptide preparations are the most promising in this regard.","Mustafin, R.

As a result, the World Health Organization declared the virus a global public health crisis and a pandemic within 2 weeks, after the virus had spread to 114 countries with 118 000 recorded cases and 4291 deaths due to the virus and related complications. The World Health Organization declaration is indicative of the enormous impact of the pandemic on human life globally. South Africa has not been exempted from that impact. While the pandemic has affected all South Africans in various ways, the poor have been most affected due to structural inequality, poverty, unemployment, and lack of access to quality health care and other services. Furthermore, public mental health has also been negatively affected by the pandemic, and this comes against a backdrop of an ailing mental health care system.

52946,Assessing the effectiveness of Covid-19 financial product innovations in supporting financially distressed firms and households in the UAE,2021-05-17,"With time, the Nipah virus has been proved as a fatal and dangerous pathogen for humanity. Nipah virus has its origin from bats and severely affects the respiratory as well as neurological organs. Regular outbreaks and unavailability of proper treatment for Nipah virus infection, demands the designing of vaccine for this disease. This prediction study was conducted to explore B cell epitopes from the Nipah virus’s proteome using the immunoinformatics approach. In this curious quest of anticipation of antigenic sites for the Insilico peptide vaccine for the Nipah virus, nine NV-B strain proteins were retrieved for further series of investigations. After sequential refining through immunoinformatics approaches, a total of 26 epitopes was selected to perform molecular modeling and docking. PEPstrMOD and Swiss model, respectively performed 3D modeling of epitopes with their respective alleles. Based on minimum binding energy, four epitopes viz. LHLGNFVRR, LNLSPLIQR, YHNMSPINR and FRRNNAIAF were predicted as promiscuous B cell epitopes. Based on low binding affinity and high population coverage worldwide, epitope LHLGNFVRR was finally selected. Increased Stability of the LHLGNFVRR- HLA DRB_1301 complex during simulation studies exhibit it as the most promising vaccine bidder. So complex of LHLGNFVRR- HLA DRB_1301 has shown most significance result for vaccine and for further validation and confirmation, wet lab and clinical trials can provide the potential of predicted peptides for the subunit vaccine.","Sharma, Suraj kumar; Srivastava, Shivani; Kumar, Ajay; Srivastava, Vivek",Int J Pept Res Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8112743/,571

In this study, we aimed to search and explain the relationship between biochemical markers, which are more common, easily available and applicable to diagnose and to stage the disease. Materials & methods: In this study, 609 patients were evaluated retrospectively. 11 biochemical parameters were included in analysis to explain the relationship with severity of disease. Results: Nearly, all the parameters that have been evaluated in this study were statistically valuable as a predictive parameter for severe disease. Areas under the curve of blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/albumin ratio (BAR), CALL score and lymphocyte/C-reactive protein ratio were 0.795, 0.778 and 0.770. The BUN/BAR and neutrophil/albumin ratios provide important prognostic information for decision-making in severe patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: High BUN/BAR and neutrophil/albumin ratios may be a better predictor of severity COVID-19 than other routinely used parameters in admission.","Gemcioglu, Emin; Davutoglu, Mehmet; Catalbas, Ramis; Karabuga, Berkan; Kaptan, Enes; Aypak, Adalet; Kalem, Ayse K; Özdemir, Mustafa; Yeşilova, Necati Y; Kalkan, Emra A; Civak, Musa; Kücüksahin, Orhan; Erden, Abdulsamet; Ates, Ihsan",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8114836/,571
53035,CARD Predictive Modeling and SEI Formulation: COVID-19 Statistics in India,2021-05-20,"Entrepreneurship is a promising business avenue that individuals, groups and governments can explore and adopt for economic progress. However, there have been high rates of failure of entrepreneurial start-ups within their first 5 years across the globe. In this regard, the aim of the study was to explore ways of improving the sustainability of entrepreneurial start-ups. The study employed a thematic synthesis exploratory analysis on 105 articles. The paper sheds light on survival tools which may be applicable particularly during the setting-up of entrepreneurial ventures as well as in the course of difficult economic periods. The research findings were that, firstly, the entrepreneurial start-ups are prone to risks that if left uncontrolled would impact on their survival. Secondly, there exists a strong theoretical basis for birth (start-up) and death (failure/exit) of start-ups although failure is a learning opportunity. Thirdly, club theory provides a platform for a sharing economy which resource constrained start-ups would find cost friendly. Fourthly, building of relationships through collaboration and social networking has been in existence but favourably emerging approach that could offer start-ups a lifeline through accruing social capital. Fifthly, incubation and responsible innovation have continually been embraced wherein science and research are key ingredients for start-ups’ sustainability. Finally, sustainability of entrepreneurial start-ups is a cumulative effect from existing and new product(s) and process(es) aspects. The insights emanating from this exploratory study may serve as signals to governments and private stakeholders of the urgency to initiate frameworks that would incorporate and facilitate entrepreneurial start-ups in implementing sustainability programmes. The findings derived from the study are expected to influence the sustainability management theory especially for entrepreneurial start-ups. Based on the limitations of manual exploratory analysis, the study recommends consideration of machine learning methods in conducting future exploratory studies.","Karani, Charles; Mshenga, Patience",J Glob Entrepr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8120765/,571
53183,I Lost All Feeling (But Got it Back): An Essay Account of “Publish or Perish” During COVID-19,2021-04-14,"Religion and spirituality (R/S) serve as coping mechanisms for circumstances that threaten people’s psychological well-being. However, using R/S inappropriately to deal with difficulties and problems in daily life may include the practice of Spiritual Bypass (SB). SB refers to avoiding addressing emotional problems and trauma, rather than healing and learning from them. On the other hand, coping strategies may be determined by the cultural context. This study aims to describe the presence of SB in individuals who may have experienced stressful situations and to understand the influence of culture on SB by comparing SB in two culturally different groups. The sample consists of a total of 435 people, 262 of Honduran nationality and 173 of Spanish nationality. Both groups are approximately equivalent in age and gender. The degree of SB, stressful events, perception of social support and spiritual well-being are examined, respectively, through the Spiritual Bypass Scale, and specific items and subscales from the Social Readjustment Rating Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Spiritual Wellbeing. The results showed a higher spiritual well-being and use of SB in the Honduran sample as compared to the Spanish sample, but similar social support and stressful events. Furthermore, some of the factors predicting SB were different between the two samples. While age and a greater number of R/S practices were important in both samples, for the Honduran sample the variables that best explained SB were being a Christian, having greater social support, fewer stressful events, and greater attendance at church or temple. For the Spanish sample, however, the variable that best explained SB was studying R/S texts. Therefore, SB must be understood within the culture in which it develops, since in different cultural contexts it appears to relate to differing factors. Thus, SB becomes a possible functional or dysfunctional coping strategy depending on the social context.","Motiño, Alejandra; Saiz, Jesús; Sánchez-Iglesias, Iván; Salazar, María; Barsotti, Tiffany J.; Goldsby, Tamara L.; Chopra, Deepak; Mills, Paul J.",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8134675/,571

54363,A Geographical Analysis of the African COVID-19 Paradox: Putting the Poverty-as-a-Vaccine Hypothesis to the Test,2021-06-14,"BACKGROUND: Because of COVID-19 public health restrictions, telemedicine has replaced conventional outpatient follow up for most patients with chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorders treated with biologic drugs. Innovative solutions to facilitate remote therapeutic drug monitoring are therefore required. Low-volume intracapillary blood sampling can be undertaken by patients at home and samples returned by post to central laboratories. METHODS: We sought to report the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on requests for therapeutic drug monitoring and the equivalence, acceptability and effectiveness of low-volume intracapillary fingerprick sampling compared to conventional venepuncture. Drug and antidrug antibody levels were measured using standard ELISAs. RESULTS: Therapeutic drug monitoring requests for adalimumab (96.5 [70.5 - 106] per week to 52 [33.5 - 57.0], p < 0.001) but not infliximab (184.5 [161.2 - 214.2] to 161 [135 - 197.5], p = 0.34) reduced during the first UK stay-at-home lockdown compared with the preceding six months. Fingerprick sampling was equivalent to conventional venepuncture for adalimumab (Figure 1), infliximab, vedolizumab, and ustekinumab drug and anti-adalimumab and -infliximab antibody levels. The median (IQR) volume of serum obtained using intracapillary sampling was 195µL (130–210). More than 87% (90/103) patients agreed that intracapillary testing was easy and 69% (71/103) preferred it to conventional venepuncture (Figure 2). In routine care, 75.3% (58/77) patients returned two blood samples within 14 days to permit remote assessment of biologic therapeutic drug monitoring. [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Therapeutic drug monitoring can be undertaken using patient-led remote intracapillary blood sampling and has the potential to be a key adjunct to telemedicine in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.","Chee, D; Nice, R; Hamilton, B; Jones, E; Hawkins, S; Redstone, C; Cairnes, V; Pohl, K; Chanchlani, N; Lin, S; Kennedy, N; Ahmad, T; Goodhand, J; McDonald, T",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194641/,571

It was a theoretical response to what this paper has termed as “the African COVID-19 paradox” or what some have characterised as the “African COVID-19 anomaly” whose thesis is though Africa is the poorest continent in the world, yet it has some of the lowest COVID-19 infection and mortality rates globally. This paradoxical profile apparently contradicts earlier and grim projections by several international bodies on the fate of Africa in this global health crisis. Given this background, we specifically tested the validity of the hypothesis from a geographic perspective within the spatial framework of Africa. Data came from secondary sources. Evidence truly points out a significant negative relationship between COVID-19 and poverty in Africa and thus statistically supports the poverty-as-a-vaccine hypothesis. However, this does not confirm that poverty confers immunity against COVID-19 but it implicitly shows there are complex factors responsible for the anomaly. The main conclusion of the paper is that poverty has no protective immunity against COVID-19 in Africa and is therefore not tenable.","Osayomi, Tolulope; Adeleke, Richard; Akpoterai, Lawrence Enejeta; Fatayo, Opeyemi Caleb; Ayanda, Joy Temitope; Moyin-Jesu, Judah; Isioye, Abdullahi; Popoola, Ayobami Abayomi",Earth Syst Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8200784/,571

Currently, over 13 million individuals around the world have contracted the disease and over 573,000 individuals have died as a result of the disease. If individuals contract COVID‐19, comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, and obesity make individuals more susceptible to severe illnesses or even death. Nationally, the death rate of COVID‐19 in African Americans is more than twice that of Whites and Latinos. To better understand the devastating effects of COVID‐19 on the African American community, our goal is to examine data from the Jackson Heart Study, which currently investigates risk factors associated with CVD in African Americans, a comorbidity of COVID‐19. The prevalence of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, overweight and obesity in participants of the Jackson Heart Study is 62.9%, 18.8%, 32.2%, and 53.3%, respectively. African Americans account for approximately 37.8% of the population in MS; however, they account for approximately 50% of the cases and 51% of the deaths related to COVID‐19. In the Jackson, MS area, African Americans account for 72%, 56%, and 45% of COVID‐19 related deaths in Hinds, Madison and Rankin counties, respectively. In summary, the prevalence of COVID‐19 comorbidities in the participants of the Jackson Heart Study should alert and equip residents and health care workers to help reduce the disparate outcomes of the pandemic in this community.

In this paper, the Thai-Chinese Rayong Industrial Zone (TCRIZ), and the China-Indonesia Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone (KITIC) are discussed in the context of the evolving development strategies and trajectories through three interrelated conceptual lenses — policy mobility, actor networks, and partnerships. The actor-network theory provides a lens to analyze how policy mobility and partnerships develop for two industrial zone case studies. The development, which involves a multi-scalar process, is shaped by the interactions among the national states, the regional governments and corporations against a background of globalization. Three types of transnational actor partnership networks have been identified, namely, hierarchical partnership, spontaneous partnership, and hybrid partnership. A highlight of the study is the role that the partnerships play in the process of policy mobility when it comes to the overseas industrial zones. It is argued that the partnerships are the key to achieving technology transfer on a cross-national basis, and the effectiveness of the technology transfer is dependent on partner selection and the roles of the actors in policy mobility.","Song, Tao; Sun, Man; Liang, Yutian; Ngampramuan, Soavapa; Wuzhati, Yeerken; Zhou, Keyang",J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8240771/,571

We studied how five companies operating in different industries (three in automotive, one in printing, and one in rubber and plastic products manufacturing) managed to reorganize activities and employ their R&D and innovation capabilities to enhance their resilience. Simultaneously, they increased the health system’s capacity to cope with the outbreak. Through a qualitative inductive study, based on interviews with company managers, we found that the firms mobilized their resources and capabilities to expand their ability to adapt and cope with adversity at the organizational level. In addition, moved by the sensitivity to the extreme context and a perceived sense of urgency, the firms deployed the same endowments to strengthen the community’s response to a crisis. Our study shows that an organization can directly and positively foster the broader social system’s resilience.

Particulate Matter less than 2.5 µm in diameter (PM(2.5)) is the most dangerous air pollutant invading the human respiratory system and causing lung and heart diseases. Therefore, innovative air pollution forecasting methods and systems are required to reduce such risk. To that end, this paper proposes an Internet of Things (IoT) enabled system for monitoring and predicting PM(2.5) concentration on both edge devices and the cloud. This system employs a hybrid prediction architecture using several Machine Learning (ML) algorithms hosted by Nonlinear AutoRegression with eXogenous input (NARX). It uses the past 24 h of PM(2.5), cumulated wind speed and cumulated rain hours to predict the next hour of PM(2.5). This system was tested on a PC to evaluate cloud prediction and a Raspberry P(i) to evaluate edge devices’ prediction. Such a system is essential, responding quickly to air pollution in remote areas with low bandwidth or no internet connection. The performance of our system was assessed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE), coefficient of determination (R(2)), Index of Agreement (IA), and duration in seconds. The obtained results highlighted that NARX/LSTM achieved the highest R(2) and IA and the least RMSE and NRMSE, outperforming other previously proposed deep learning hybrid algorithms.

Various pathogens cause the disease, but the most significant viral pathogens include avian influenza virus (AIV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are the most prevalent. To detect these pathogens, various methods have been discovered in the last decades. Detection and characterization of viruses by metagenomics methods have improved our knowledge about the role of virome in the avian complex respiratory disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This research investigates the viral pathogen populations that mostly participate in emerging these diseases using the NGS method RNA-sequencing. In surveillance of ten broiler farms from different cities with respiratory symptoms, trachea samples were collected to determine the pathogenic virome causing the disease. RESULTS: In this metagenomics analysis, nine viral families were identified, comprising 72.82% of RNA viruses, 24.32% of RT viruses, and 2.86% of DNA viruses. RNA viruses had the highest contribution to the respiratory disease complex instead of disease, including paramyxoviridae, orthomyxoviridae, coronaviridae, and picornaviridae viruses. Other viruses from the RNA viruses and DNA virus families were also identified in addition to these results. CONCLUSION: This research suggests that studies of pathogenic viromes in different diseases can help monitor different diseases and predict their future occurrence.","Rajeoni, Ali Hojabr; Ghalyanchilangeroudi, Arash; Khalesi, Bahman; Madadi, Mohammad Sadegh; Hosseini, Hossein",Iran J Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8416587/,571

However, there is limited evidence about how political regime transition impacts public health. We use two samples of the states around the world to trace the impact of regime transition on public health: the first sample comprises 29 post-communist states, along with 20 consolidated democracies, for the period of 1970–2014; the second sample is a subsample of the same 29 post-communist states but only for the period of transition, 1990–2014. We find that the post-communist states experienced some decline in life expectancy in the first few years of transition (1990–1995). Yet, with a steady increase in the measure of democracy from 1995 onwards, life expectancy significantly improved and infant mortality decreased. Therefore, in the long run, democratization has had a positive impact on both the life expectancy and infant mortality of citizens of the post-communist states.","Nazarov, Zafar; Obydenkova, Anastassia",Soc Indic Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8475343/,571

METHODS: From January 2018 to December 2019, 53 patients diagnosed with UC in our hospital were selected. According to their medical syndromes, they were divided into the damp-heat internal accumulation group (n = 35) and the spleen-kidney yang deficiency group (n = 18). 21 healthy volunteers were selected as the control group. The Mayo scoring standard was used to determine the severity of the patient's condition. The expression levels of Th17/Treg cells and related cytokines in peripheral blood were compared between the groups. Pearson correlation was used to analyze the correlation between the ratio of Th17 and Treg cells in the peripheral blood of UC patients and the ratio of TH17/Treg with Mayo score. RESULTS: The peripheral blood Th17 cell ratio and Th17/Treg ratio of the damp-heat internal accumulation and spleen-kidney yang deficiency group were higher than those of the control group; the Treg cell ratio was lower than that of the control group; the peripheral blood Th17 cell ratio and Th17/Treg ratio of the damp-heat internal accumulation group were higher those of the spleen-kidney yang deficiency group; and the proportion of Treg cells was lower than that of the spleen-kidney yang deficiency group (P < 0.05). The expression levels of serum IL-6, IL-17, IL-22, and TNF-α in the damp-heat internal accumulation and spleen-kidney yang deficiency group were higher than those of the control group; IL-10 and TGF-β were lower than those of the control group; the levels of serum IL-6, IL-17, IL-22, and TNF-α in the damp-heat internal accumulation group were higher than those of the spleen-kidney yang deficiency group; and both IL-10 and TGF-β were lower than those of the spleen-kidney yang deficiency group (P < 0.05). The peripheral blood Th17 cell ratio and Th17/Treg ratio in the moderately active period group and severely active period group were higher than those of the lightly active period group; the Treg cell ratio was lower than that of the lightly active period group; the peripheral blood Th17 cell ratio and Th17/Treg ratio in the severely active period group were higher than those in the moderately active period group; and the proportion of Treg cells was lower than that of the moderately active period group. Pearson correlation analysis showed that the proportion of Th17 cells and Th17/Treg in peripheral blood of UC patients were both positively correlated with Mayo score (r = 0.762, r = 0.777, P < 0.001). Treg was negatively correlated with Mayo score (r = −0.790, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: There are differences in the expression of peripheral blood Th17/Treg cells and related cytokines among UC patients with different syndromes, and the damp-heat content is the most significant. The higher the ratio of Th17 cells in peripheral blood and the degree of Th17/Treg imbalance, the lower the ratio of Treg cells, and the more severe the condition of UC patients, which can provide a preliminary quantitative basis for the TCM classification and severity of the diagnosis of UC.","Yu, Jianhua; Wang, Shu; Yuan, Hongsheng; Qiao, Tingyue; Bao, Miao",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8486524/,571

Yet drug and delivery costs prohibit access in many jurisdictions. In the absence of guidelines for the synthesis of economic evaluations, we developed a protocol for a systematic review of economic evaluation studies for PrEP by drawing on best practices in systematic reviews and the conduct and reporting of economic evaluations. We aim to estimate the incremental cost per health outcome of PrEP compared with placebo, no PrEP, or other HIV prevention strategies; assess the methodological variability in, and quality of, economic evaluations of PrEP; estimate the incremental cost per health outcome of different PrEP implementation strategies; and quantify the potential sources of heterogeneity in outcomes. METHODS We will systematically search electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase) and the gray literature. We will include economic evaluation studies that assess both costs and health outcomes of PrEP in HIV-uninfected individuals, without restricting language or year of publication. Two reviewers will independently screen studies using predefined inclusion criteria, extract data, and assess methodological quality using the Philips checklist, Second Panel on the Cost-effectiveness of Health and Medicines, and the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research recommendations. Outcomes of interest include incremental costs and outcomes in natural units or utilities, cost-effectiveness ratios, and net monetary benefit. We will perform descriptive and quantitative syntheses using sensitivity analyses of outcomes by population subgroups, HIV epidemic settings, study designs, baseline intervention contexts, key parameter inputs and assumptions, type of outcomes, economic perspectives, and willingness to pay values.

61408,Psychopathology and resilience following traumatic injury: a latent growth mixture model analysis.,2010,"Syndemic Theory (ST) provides a framework to examine mutually enhancing diseases/health issues under conditions of social inequality and inequity. ST has been used in multiple disciplines to address interacting infectious diseases, noncommunicable diseases, and mental health conditions. The theory has been critiqued for its inability to measure disease interactions and their individual and combined health outcomes. This article reviews literature that strongly suggests a syndemic between food insecurity (FI) and diet-related chronic diseases (DRCDs), and proposes a model to measure the extent of such interaction. The article seeks to: (1) examine the potential syndemic between FI and DRCDs; (2) illustrate how the incorporation of Life History Theory (LHT), into a syndemic framework can help to highlight critical lifeperiods when FI-DRCD interactions result in adverse health outcomes; (3) discuss the use of mixed methods to identify and measure syndemics to enhance the precision and predictive power of ST; and (4) propose an analytical model for the examination of the FI-DRCD syndemic through the life course. The proposed model is more relevant now given the significant increase in FI globally as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The differential impact that the pandemic appears to have among various age groups and by other demographic factors (e.g., race, gender, income) offers an opportunity to examine the potential FI-DRCD syndemic under the lens of LHT.","Himmelgreen, David; Romero-Daza, Nancy; Heuer, Jacquelyn; Lucas, William; Salinas-Miranda, Abraham A; Stoddard, Theresa",Social science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32586635/,571
61562,COVID-19: Challenges and opportunities for dermatology response.,2020-04-03,"Adipose tissue is essential for metabolic homeostasis, balancing lipid storage and mobilisation based on nutritional status. This is coordinated by insulin, which triggers kinase signalling cascades to modulate numerous metabolic proteins, leading to increased glucose uptake and anabolic processes like lipogenesis. Given recent evidence that glucose is dispensable for adipocyte respiration, we sought to test whether glucose is necessary for insulin-stimulated anabolism. Examining lipogenesis in cultured adipocytes, glucose was essential for insulin to stimulate the synthesis of fatty acids and glyceride-glycerol. Importantly, glucose was dispensable for lipogenesis in the absence of insulin, suggesting distinct carbon sources are used with or without insulin. Metabolic tracing studies revealed glucose was required for insulin to stimulate pathways providing carbon substrate, NADPH, and glycerol 3'-phosphate for lipid synthesis and storage. Glucose also displaced leucine as a lipogenic substrate and was necessary to suppress fatty acid oxidation. Together, glucose provided substrates and metabolic control for insulin to promote lipogenesis in adipocytes. This contrasted with the suppression of lipolysis by insulin signalling, which occurred independently of glucose. Given previous observations that signal transduction acts primarily before glucose uptake in adipocytes, these data are consistent with a model whereby insulin initially utilises protein phosphorylation to stimulate lipid anabolism, which is sustained by subsequent glucose metabolism. Consequently, lipid abundance was sensitive to glucose availability, both during adipogenesis and in Drosophila flies in vivo. Together, these data highlight the importance of glucose metabolism to support insulin action, providing a complementary regulatory mechanism to signal transduction to stimulate adipose anabolism.","Krycer, James R; Quek, Lake-Ee; Francis, Deanne; Zadoorian, Armella; Weiss, Fiona C; Cooke, Kristen C; Nelson, Marin E; Diaz-Vegas, Alexis; Humphrey, Sean J; Scalzo, Richard; Hirayama, Akiyoshi; Ikeda, Satsuki; Shoji, Futaba; Suzuki, Kumi; Huynh, Kevin; Giles, Corey; Varney, Bianca; Nagarajan, Shilpa R; Hoy, Andrew J; Soga, Tomoyoshi; Meikle, Peter J; Cooney, Gregory J; Fazakerley, Daniel J; James, David E",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra120.014907; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32723868/,571
61816,Covid-19: Black people over 80 in England are half as likely as white people to have been vaccinated.,2021-02-05,"INTRODUCTION Death due to opioid overdose was declared a public health crisis in Canada in 2015. Traditionally, patients who have overdosed on opioids that are managed by emergency medical services (EMS) are treated with the opioid antagonist naloxone, provided ventilatory support and subsequently transported to hospital. However, certain EMS agencies have permitted patients who have been reversed from opioid overdose to refuse transport, if the patient exhibits capacity to do so. Evidence on the safety of this practice is limited. Therefore, our intent was to examine the available literature to determine mortality and serious adverse events within 48 hours of EMS treat and release due to suspected rebound opioid toxicity after naloxone administration. METHODS A systematic search was performed on 11 May 2017 in PubMed, Cochrane Central, Embase and CINHAL. Studies that reported on the outcome of patients treated with prehospital naloxone and released at the scene were included. Analyses for incidence of mortality and adverse events at the scene were conducted. Risk of bias and assessment of publication bias was also done. RESULTS 1401 records were screened after duplicate removal. Eighteen full-text studies were reviewed with seven selected for inclusion. None were found to be high risk of bias. In most studies, heroin was the source of the overdose. Mortality within 48 hours was infrequent with only four deaths among 4912 patients ﴾0.081%﴿ in the seven studies. Only one study reported on adverse events and found no incidence of adverse events from their sample of 71 released patients. CONCLUSION Mortality or serious adverse events due to suspected rebound toxicity in patients released on scene post-EMS treatment with naloxone were rare. However, studies involving longer-acting opioids were rare and no study involved fentanyl.","Greene, Jennifer Anne; Deveau, Brent J; Dol, Justine S; Butler, Michael B",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2018-207534; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580317/,571

In this context, the use of a microscope drape method is proposed, to minimise aerosol spread in the wider operating theatre environment. METHODS The efficacy of the method is assessed with a simulation model, using a CMI Concept Air Trace MK2 smoke generator for aerosol generation and a Fluke 985 air particle counter to measure air particles sized 0.3-10 μm in the operating theatre environment. RESULTS Aerosol spread was contained almost to baseline levels with the application of the drape barrier and the negative pressure created using suction within the drape. CONCLUSION The method is an efficient adjunct that could reduce the risk of aerosol shedding and viral transmission to the operating theatre team. It potentially allows faster operating theatre turnover and more liberal use of powered instruments during endonasal surgery.","Ioannidis, D; Tsagkovits, A; Rokade, A",The Journal of laryngology and otology,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0022215120001838; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32921336/,571

A novel minocycline/rifampin tyrosine-coated, noncrosslinked porcine acellular dermal matrix (XenMatrix AB) was developed to protect the device from microbial colonization for up to 7 days. The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial efficacy of this device against clinically isolated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Escherichia coli. Methods XenMatrix AB was compared with 5 existing uncoated soft tissue repair devices using in vitro methods of zone of inhibition (ZOI) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at 24 hours following inoculation with MRSA or E coli These devices were also evaluated at 7 days following dorsal implantation and inoculation with MRSA or E coli (60 male New Zealand white rabbits, n = 10 per group) for viable colony-forming units (CFU), abscess formation and histopathologic response, respectively. Results In vitro studies demonstrated a median ZOI of 36 mm for MRSA and 16 mm for E coli for XenMatrix AB, while all uncoated devices showed no inhibition of bacterial growth (0 mm). SEM also demonstrated no visual evidence of MRSA or E coli colonization on the surface of XenMatrix AB compared with colonization of all other uncoated devices. In vivo XenMatrix AB demonstrated complete inhibition of bacterial colonization, no abscess formation, and a reduced inflammatory response compared with uncoated devices. Conclusion We demonstrated that XenMatrix AB possesses potent in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial efficacy against clinically isolated MRSA and E coli compared with uncoated devices.","Majumder, Arnab; Scott, Jeffrey R; Novitsky, Yuri W",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350616656280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27354551/,571
65074,Covid-19: US governors call for government help to secure more tests.,2020-04-21,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The traditional approach to sepsis treatment utilizes broad-spectrum antibiotics. Unfortunately, a significant proportion of infected patients have 'culture-negative' sepsis despite appropriate microbiologic assessment. RECENT FINDINGS There has been increased interest in the past decade on the treatment of culture-negative sepsis. Outcome data comparing culture-negative sepsis with culture-positive sepsis are mixed and it is unclear if culture-negative sepsis is a distinct entity. Recent recommendations promoting antibiotic de-escalation in culture-negative sepsis can be difficult to implement. A variety of strategies have been suggested for limiting antibiotic courses among patients with negative cultures, including limiting antibiotic durations, use of antibiotic stewardship programs, early consideration of narrow antibiotics, rapid diagnostic technology, and eliminating anti-MRSA therapy based on surveillance swabs. SUMMARY Owing to the difficulty inherent in studying the lack of positive data, and to the uncertainty surrounding diagnosis in patients with culture-negative sepsis, prospective data to guide antibiotic choices are lacking. However, antibiotic de-escalation in culture-negative sepsis is both recommended and feasible in patients showing clinical signs of improvement. Increased use of rapid diagnostics, careful consideration of antibiotic necessity, and antibiotic stewardship programs may result in less antibiotic days and better outcomes.","Thorndike, Jonathan; Kollef, Marin H",Current opinion in critical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0000000000000751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32773615/,571

65863,Correction to Data in Trial of Convalescent Plasma Treatment for COVID-19.,2020-08-04,"Currently there is only one method of treatment for human schistosomiasis, the drug praziquantel. Strong selective pressure has caused a serious concern for a rise in resistance to praziquantel leading to the necessity for additional pharmaceuticals, with a distinctly different mechanism of action, to be used in combination therapy with praziquantel. Previous treatment of Schistosoma mansoni included the use of oxamniquine (OXA), a prodrug that is enzymatically activated in S. mansoni but is ineffective against S. haematobium and S. japonicum. The oxamniquine activating enzyme was identified as a S. mansoni sulfotransferase (SmSULT-OR). Structural data have allowed for directed drug development in reengineering oxamniquine to be effective against S. haematobium and S. japonicum. Guided by data from X-ray crystallographic studies and Schistosoma worm killing assays on oxamniquine, our structure-based drug design approach produced a robust SAR program that tested over 300 derivatives and identified several new lead compounds with effective worm killing in vitro. Previous studies resulted in the discovery of compound CIDD-0066790, which demonstrated broad-species activity in killing of schistosome species. As these compounds are racemic mixtures, we tested and demonstrate that the R enantiomer CIDD-007229 kills S. mansoni, S. haematobium and S. japonicum better than the parent drug (CIDD-0066790). The search for derivatives that kill better than CIDD-0066790 has resulted in a derivative (CIDD- 149830) that kills 100% of S. mansoni, S. haematobium and S. japonicum adult worms within 7 days. We hypothesize that the difference in activation and thus killing by the derivatives is due to the ability of the derivative to fit in the binding pocket of each sulfotransferase (SmSULT-OR, ShSULT-OR, SjSULT-OR) and to be efficiently sulfated. The purpose of this research is to develop a second drug to be used in conjunction with praziquantel to treat the major human species of Schistosoma. Collectively, our findings show that CIDD-00149830 and CIDD-0072229 are promising novel drugs for the treatment of human schistosomiasis and strongly support further development and in vivo testing.","Guzman, Meghan A; Rugel, Anastasia R; Tarpley, Reid S; Alwan, Sevan N; Chevalier, Frédéric D; Kovalskyy, Dmytro P; Cao, Xiaohang; Holloway, Stephen P; Anderson, Timothy J C; Taylor, Alexander B; McHardy, Stanton F; LoVerde, Philip T",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008517; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810153/,571

We report the identification of nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2) as a novel structural component of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) particle. A set of custom α-nsp2 antibodies targeting conserved epitopes within four distinct regions of nsp2 (the PLP2 protease domain [OTU], the hypervariable domain [HV], the putative transmembrane domain [TM], and the C-terminal region [C]) were obtained commercially and validated in PRRSV-infected cells. Highly purified cell-free virions of several PRRSV strains were isolated through multiple rounds of differential density gradient centrifugation and analyzed by immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) and Western blot assays using the α-nsp2 antibodies. Purified viral preparations were found to contain pleomorphic, predominantly spherical virions of uniform size (57.9 nm ± 8.1 nm diameter; n = 50), consistent with the expected size of PRRSV particles. Analysis by IEM indicated the presence of nsp2 associated with the viral particle of diverse strains of PRRSV. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of nsp2 in purified viral samples and revealed that multiple nsp2 isoforms were associated with the virion. Finally, a recombinant PRRSV genome containing a myc-tagged nsp2 was used to generate purified virus, and these particles were also shown to harbor myc-tagged nsp2 isoforms. Together, these data identify nsp2 as a virion-associated structural PRRSV protein and reveal that nsp2 exists in or on viral particles as multiple isoforms.","Kappes, Matthew A; Miller, Cathy L; Faaberg, Kay S",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02435-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24089566/,571

67680,"Covid-19, prison crowding, and release policies.",2020-04-20,"BACKGROUND The use of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) has been proposed for the treatment of several acute and chronic syndromes, such as corneal epithelial defects and dry eye syndrome, gum bleeding during oral surgery, and in orthopaedic surgery. We hypothesized that PRGF, rather than PRP, could be more effective because of its intrinsic characteristics in promoting the healing of intestinal anastomosis. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate and compare the effects of PRP and PRGF on various parameters of anastomotic healing in a swine model. METHODS Eight female pigs were randomly assigned to two groups and subjected to hand sewn jeujuno-jejunal appositional extramucosal anastomoses. For each animal, a total of six anastomoses were performed: two were considered controls and received no treatment, while the remaining four anastomoses were treated with PRP or PRGF of which both were prepared at a platelet concentration that was respectively 3.4-fold and 2.81-fold higher than the original platelet count. In each animal, either PRP or PRGF was used as a treatment, to avoid interference among products. Animals were euthanized after 8 days and the anastomoses were evaluated and compared for the presence of adhesions, anastomotic leakage, bursting pressure, and histological appearance. RESULTS The concentration of platelets in PRP was 3.41-fold higher (range, 3.20-4.24) that the concentration in whole blood, while the concentration in PRGF was 2.81-fold higher (range, 2.89-4.88). The results obtained from the present study highlighted that there are no differences between anastomotic samples treated with either PRP or PRGF preparations, except for a significant increase in epithelization of the intestinal mucosa at the anastomotic site in the PRGF group. CONCLUSIONS Both PRP and PRGF suspensions should be considered a safe strategy and represent a relatively low-cost technology that is flexible enough to be applied in several therapeutic fields. No true benefit could be proven in our study compared to the no treatment following anastomoses formation, with the exception of enhanced epithelization of the mucosa in the PRGF group.","Giusto, Gessica; Vercelli, Cristina; Iussich, Selina; Tursi, Massimiliano; Perona, Giovanni; Gandini, Marco",BMC veterinary research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-017-1102-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28629420/,571

BACKGROUND A PSH is the most frequent complication after stoma formation. Symptoms may range from mild abdominal pain to life-threatening obstruction and strangulation. The treatment of a PSH is notoriously difficult and recurrences up to 20% have been reported despite the use of mesh. This has moved surgical focus toward prevention. METHODS Augmentation of the abdominal wall with a retro-muscular lightweight polypropylene mesh was compared with the traditional formation of a colostomy. In total, 150 patients (1:1 ratio) were included. The incidence of a PSH, morbidity, mortality, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness was measured after 1 year of follow-up. RESULTS There was no difference between groups regarding demographics and predisposing factors for PSH. Three out of 67 patients (4.5%) in the mesh group and 16 out of 66 patients (24.2%) in the nonmesh group developed a PSH (P = 0.0011). No statistically significant difference was found in infections, concomitant hernias, SF-36 questionnaire, Von Korff pain score, and cost-effectiveness between both study groups. CONCLUSION Prophylactic augmentation of the abdominal wall with a retromuscular lightweight polypropylene mesh at the ostomy site significantly reduces the incidence of PSH without a significant difference in morbidity, mortality, quality of life, or cost-effectiveness.","Brandsma, Henk-Thijs; Hansson, Birgitta M E; Aufenacker, Theo J; van Geldere, Dick; Lammeren, Felix M V; Mahabier, Chander; Makai, Peter; Steenvoorde, Pascal; de Vries Reilingh, Tammo S; Wiezer, Marinus J; de Wilt, Johannes H W; Bleichrodt, Robert P; Rosman, Camiel",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000001903; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27471840/,571

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of endostatin on Wnt signaling pathway of stem-like cells in bladder cancer in tumor microenvironment. The qRT-PCR assay and western blot were conducted to evaluate related factors expressions of Wnt signaling pathway in both bladder cancer 5637 cells and stem cells. Loss of function assays were carried out to detect the influence of endostatin on the proliferation, migration, cell proliferation and apoptosis of bladder cancer cells. We demonstrated that endostatin triggered the degradation of β-catenin, a key mediator of Wnt signaling. The activation of the endostatin blocked β-catenin function and inhibited cell growth and migration of bladder cancer. In order to verify that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was inhibited by endostain in 5637 bladder cancer cells and stem cells, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway-associated molecules, including DKK1, LRP5, TCF4, β-catenin, cyclin D1, and c-Myc, were evaluated in 5637 bladder cancer cells and stem cells.

G4 structure dynamics is regulated by G4 structure binding proteins and is thought to be crucial for the maintenance of genome integrity in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Growing research over the last decade has expanded the existing knowledge of the functional diversity of G4 (DNA and RNA) structures across the working models. The control of G4 structure dynamics using G4 binding drugs has been suggested as the putative targets in the control of cancer and bacterial pathogenesis. This review has brought forth the collections of recent information that indicate G4 (mostly G4 DNA) roles in microbial pathogenesis, DNA damaging stress response in bacteria and mammalian cells.

The aim of the study was to report our experience with a pre-operative training to non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) and a mechanical insufflator-exsufflator (MI-E) device to improve the post-operative respiratory outcome of children scheduled for scoliosis surgery. METHODS Consecutive patients with non-idiopathic scoliosis undergoing posterior arthrodesis were trained to NPPV and MI-E before intervention. NPPV and MI-E were performed immediately after extubation. Length of intubation and intensive care unit (ICU) stay, duration of NPPV, and respiratory complications were assessed. RESULTS Thirteen patients participated in the training (mean age 13.9 ± 2.6, mean vital capacity 52.3 ± 15.4% predicted). The patients had severe respiratory muscle weakness with a mean sniff oesophageal pressure of 35.8 ± 14.2 cmH2O (50% predicted) and a mean gastric pressure during a cough of 31.9 ± 7.8 cmH2O (30% predicted). The mean length of intubation was 19.9 ± 12.3 h with a mean length of ICU stay of 2.5 ± 2.5 days. NPPV was used during a mean of 2.7 ± 1.9 days after surgery. No respiratory complication was observed. One patient died 3 months after surgery from multi-organ failure of non-respiratory origin. CONCLUSIONS No respiratory complications were observed after scoliosis correction surgery in children with non-idiopathic scoliosis after pre-operative training and post-operative use of NPPV and MI-E, underlying the interest of this management in these high-risk patients.","Khirani, Sonia; Bersanini, Chiara; Aubertin, Guillaume; Bachy, Manon; Vialle, Raphaël; Fauroux, Brigitte","European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00586-014-3335-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24816609/,571

Treatment strategies offer alleviation of symptoms in the absence of commercially available specific antiviral agents. Within this context, the introduction of innovative therapeutic approaches against the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a critical need that should be addressed urgently. The anti-inflammatory effect of low dose irradiation has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for COVID-19 pneumonia. Consideration of external beam irradiation for management of COVID-19 pneumonia has prompted the investigation of alternative methods of irradiation with potentially improved toxicity profiles. Theoretically, targeted radiotherapy may have several advantages over conventional external beam radiotherapy owing to the capability to deliver effective radiation doses without adverse irradiation effects. Since radionuclides are conjugated to targeting vectors, such as antibodies and cell surface receptor binding peptides, irradiation may be focused on targeted cells with optimal sparing of surrounding normal tissues. In the context of COVID-19 management, targeted irradiation is expected to compromise SARS-CoV-2 extracellular virions. Targeted radiotherapy may offer a viable means of combating against SARS-CoV-2 virus. There is room for improvement with the need for efficacy, feasibility, and toxicity studies. Although targeted radiotherapy itself may not achieve absolute eradication of virus or virus-infected cells, it may at least serve as a supplementary therapeutic strategy that could be utilized in combination with other antiviral treatments. Further investigations focusing on nuclear medicine, radiopharmaceuticals, and targeted radiotherapy strategies may pave the way for the development of efficacious antiviral treatments which may be utilized in the battle against the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Sager, Omer; Dincoglan, Ferrat; Demiral, Selcuk; Beyzadeoglu, Murat",Current radiopharmaceuticals,https://doi.org/10.2174/1874471014666211011122250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34635047/,571

METHODS twenty-two patients with BE diagnosed by upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy with biopsies and ED diagnosed by conventional esophageal manometry (CEM) were submitted to a LNF, and followed up with clinical evaluations, upper GI endoscopy with biopsies and CEM, for a minimum of 12 months after the surgical procedure. RESULTS : sixteen patients were male (72.7%) and six were females (27.3%). The mean age was 55.14 (± 15.52) years old. and the mean postoperative follow-up was 26.2 months. The upper GI endoscopy showed that the mean length of BE was 4.09 cm preoperatively and 3.91cm postoperatively (p=0.042). The evaluation of esophageal dysmotility through conventional manometry showed that: the preoperative median of the lower esophageal sphincter resting pressure (LESRP) was 9.15 mmHg and 13.2 mmHg postoperatively (p=0.006). The preoperative median of the esophageal contraction amplitude was 47.85 mmHg, and 57.50 mmHg postoperatively (p=0.408). Preoperative evaluation of esophageal peristalsis showed that 13.6% of the sample presented diffuse esophageal spasm and 9.1% ineffective esophageal motility. In the postoperative, 4.5% of patients had diffuse esophageal spasm, 13.6% of aperistalsis and 22.7% of ineffective motor activity (p=0.133). CONCLUSION LNF decreased the BE extension, increased the LES resting pressure, and increased the amplitude of the distal esophageal contraction; however, it was unable to improve ED.","FalcÃo, Angela M; Nasi, Ary; Szachnowicz, SÉrgio; Santa-Cruz, Fernando; Seguro, Francisco C B C; Sena, Brena F; Duarte, AndrÉ; Sallum, Rubens A; Cecconello, Ivan",Revista do Colegio Brasileiro de Cirurgioes,https://doi.org/10.1590/0100-6991e-20202637; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263652/,571

76897,Covid-19: Japan declares second state of emergency as Asia struggles with virus surge.,2021-01-15,"Uncontrolled immune system activation amplifies end-organ injury in hypertension. Nonetheless, the exact mechanisms initiating this exacerbated inflammatory response, thereby contributing to further increases in blood pressure (BP), are still being revealed. While participation of lymphoid-derived immune cells has been well described in the hypertension literature, the mechanisms by which myeloid-derived innate immune cells contribute to T cell activation, and subsequent BP elevation, remains an active area of investigation. In this article, we critically analyze the literature to understand how monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, including mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils, contribute to hypertension and hypertension-associated end-organ injury. The most abundant leukocytes, neutrophils, are indisputably increased in hypertension. However, it is unknown how (and why) they switch from critical first responders of the innate immune system, and homeostatic regulators of BP, to tissue-damaging, pro-hypertensive mediators. We propose that myeloperoxidase-derived pro-oxidants, neutrophil elastase, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and interactions with other innate and adaptive immune cells are novel mechanisms that could contribute to the inflammatory cascade in hypertension. We further posit that the gut microbiota serves as a set point for neutropoiesis and their function. Finally, given that hypertension appears to be a key risk factor for morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients, we put forth evidence that neutrophils and NETs cause cardiovascular injury post-coronavirus infection, and thus may be proposed as an intriguing therapeutic target for high-risk individuals. © 2021 American Physiological Society.

The reported prevalence of ADHD in individuals with mood disorders varies widely. METHODS We searched PsycInfo, and PubMed for articles published before September 21st , 2020 using search terms for ADHD and mood disorders. We included original data on the prevalence of ADHD in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). We estimated the prevalence of ADHD, by developmental period and disorder using random-effect meta-analyses. We also compared the rate of ADHD in people with MDD and BD, and with and without mood disorders. RESULTS Based on 92 studies including 17089 individuals, prevalence of ADHD in BD is 73% (95% CI 66-79) in childhood, 43% (95% CI 35-50) in adolescence, and 17% (95% CI 14-20) in adulthood. Data from 52 studies with 16897 individuals indicated that prevalence of ADHD in MDD is 28% (95% CI 19-39) in childhood, 17% (95% CI 12-24) in adolescence, and 7% (95% CI 4-11) in adulthood. ADHD was three times more common in people with mood disorders compared to those without, and 1.7 times more common in BD compared to MDD. CONCLUSION People with mood disorders are at a significant risk for ADHD. ADHD should be assessed and treated in individuals with BD and MDD. Comprehensive assessment strategies are needed to address challenges of diagnosing ADHD alongside mood disorders.","Sandstrom, Andrea; Perroud, Nader; Alda, Martin; Uher, Rudolf; Pavlova, Barbara",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/acps.13283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33528847/,571

77399,Let Us Be Vigilant: COVID-19 Is Poised to Obliterate Gains in Healthy Child Development Globally.,2020-08-17,"Uncertainty is a defining feature of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, because uncertainty is an aversive state, uncertainty reduction theory (URT) holds that employees try to manage it by obtaining information. To date, most evidence for the effectiveness of obtaining information to reduce uncertainty stems from research conducted in relatively stable contexts wherein employees can acquire consistent information. Yet, research on crises and news consumption provides reasons to believe that the potential for information to mitigate uncertainty as specified by URT may break down during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Integrating URT with research on crises and news consumption, we predict that consuming news information during crises-which tends to be distressing, constantly evolving, and inconsistent-will be positively related to uncertainty. This in turn may have negative implications for employee goal progress and creativity; two work outcomes that take on substantial significance in times of uncertainty and the pandemic. We further predict that death anxiety will moderate this relationship, such that the link between employees' news consumption and uncertainty is stronger for those with lower levels of death anxiety, compared to those with higher levels. We test our theorizing via an experience-sampling study with 180 full-time employees, with results providing support for our conceptual model. Our study reveals important theoretical and practical implications regarding information consumption during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

77825,[Recommendations for treatment of severe coronavirus disease 2019 based on critical care ultrasound].,2020-06-15,"INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE Chronic migraine (CM) is associated with impaired health-related quality of life and substantial socioeconomic burden, but many people with CM are underdiagnosed and do not receive appropriate preventive treatment. OnabotulinumtoxinA and topiramate have demonstrated efficacy (treatment benefit under ideal conditions) for the prevention of headaches in people with CM in clinical trials, but real-world studies suggest markedly different clinical effectiveness (treatment benefit based on a blend of efficacy and tolerability). This study sought to evaluate patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of onabotulinumtoxinA versus topiramate immediate release for people with CM. METHODS FORWARD was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, open-label, phase 4 study comparing onabotulinumtoxinA 155 U every 12 weeks with topiramate 50 to 100 mg/day for ≤36 weeks in people with CM. PROs measured included the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire Quick Depression Assessment (PHQ-9), Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health Problem (WPAI:SHP), and Functional Impact of Migraine Questionnaire (FIMQ). RESULTS A total of 282 patients were randomized and treated with onabotulinumtoxinA (n = 140) or topiramate (n = 142). From baseline to week 30, mean HIT-6 test scores improved significantly in patients taking onabotulinumtoxinA compared with topiramate (P < .001). Improvements in depression over time were observed via larger changes in PHQ-9 scores with onabotulinumtoxinA than topiramate (P < .001). Work productivity assessed via WPAI:SHP scores revealed significant improvements with onabotulinumtoxinA versus topiramate in Work Productivity Loss (P = .024) and Activity Impairment (P < .001) domains. Results from the FIMQ also revealed a larger reduction from baseline with onabotulinumtoxinA vs topiramate (P < .0001). CONCLUSION OnabotulinumtoxinA treatment had more favorable real-world effectiveness than topiramate on depression, headache impact, functioning and daily living, activity, and work productivity. The overall study results suggest that the beneficial effects on a range of PROs are the result of improved effectiveness when onabotulinumtoxinA is used as preventive treatment for CM.

The methodology allows the analytical investigation of the probabilities of gHAT elimination in the spatially connected villages of different prevalence health zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and captures the uncertainty using exact methods. Our method provides a more realistic approach to scaling the probability of elimination of infection between single villages and much larger regions, and provides results comparable to established models without the requirement of detailed infection structure. The novel flexibility allows the interventions in the model to be implemented specific to each village, and this introduces the framework to consider the possible future strategies of test-and-treat or direct treatment of individuals living in villages where cases have been found, using a new drug.","Davis, Christopher N; Keeling, Matt J; Rock, Kat S","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2021.0419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34610258/,571

A small percentage of cases persist with prolonged positive RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. The aim of this study was to determine risk factors for prolonged viral shedding among patient's basal clinical conditions. METHODS We have evaluated all 513 patients attended in our hospital between March 1 and July 1. We have selected all 18 patients with prolonged viral shedding, and compared them with 36 sex-matched randomly selected controls. Demographic, treatment and clinical data were systematically collected. RESULTS Global median duration of viral clearance was 25.5 days (n=54; IQR, 22-39.3 days), 48.5 days in cases (IQR 38.7-54.9 days) and 23 days in controls (IQR 20.2-25.7), respectively. There were not observed differences in demographic, symptoms or treatment data between groups. Chronic rhino-sinusitis and atopy were more common in patients with prolonged viral shedding (67%) compared with controls (11% and 25% respectively) (p<0.001 and p=0,003). The use of inhaled corticosteroids was also more frequent in case group (p=0.007). Multivariate analysis indicated that CRS (odds ratio [OR], 18.78; 95% confidence interval [95%CI],3.89 - 90.59; p<0.001) was independently associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in URT samples, after adjusting for initial PCR Ct values. CONCLUSION We found that chronic rhino-sinusitis and atopy might be associated with increased risk of prolonged viral shedding.

The risk of serious pathology in such polyps is low. There is a risk and cost of resecting all such polyps and sending tissue for pathologic evaluation. Enhancement of endoluminal imaging may enable discrimination of neoplastic vs non-neoplastic polyps. If this discrimination can be performed accurately with high confidence, it may be possible to either resect and discard diminutive adenomas, or inspect and do-not-resect diminutive hyperplastic polyps. In 2011, an expert group recommended thresholds of 90% negative predictive value for adenomas, and 90% accuracy in predicting appropriate surveillance intervals. Since 2011, criteria for polyp discrimination have been published and validated by experts and nonexperts. In vivo studies have been performed to compare endoscopic impression and pathologic diagnosis. An expert panel was convened in late 2014 to review the literature to determine if the proposed thresholds for discrimination can be attained and to recommend the next steps for introducing changes in clinical practice. We conclude that threshold levels can be achieved with several endoscopic image enhancements.

To date, public health organizations' efforts to counter COVID-19 misinformation have focused on identifying and correcting false information on social media platforms. Citing extant literature in health communication and psychology, we argue that these fact-checking efforts are a necessary, but insufficient, response to health misinformation. First, research suggests that fact-checking has several important limitations and is rarely successful in fully undoing the effects of misinformation exposure. Second, there are many factors driving misinformation sharing and acceptance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic-such as emotions, distrust, cognitive biases, racism, and xenophobia-and these factors both make individuals more vulnerable to certain types of misinformation and also make them impervious to future correction attempts. We conclude by outlining several additional measures, beyond fact-checking, that may help further mitigate the effects of misinformation in the current pandemic.","Chou, Wen-Ying Sylvia; Gaysynsky, Anna; Vanderpool, Robin C",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,https://doi.org/10.1177/1090198120980675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33322939/,571

Concerns continue about LESS for locally advanced tumors. We present our experience with LESS-radical nephrectomy with renal vein thrombectomy (LESS-RN-RVT) CASE PRESENTATION: Between 5-6/2009, 2 patients underwent LESS-RN-RVT (1 right-/1 left-side). Standard steps of multi-site laparoscopic radical nephrectomy were performed, including stapled renal vein thrombectomy and intact specimen extraction. Both cases were successfully completed by LESS without complications. Mean tumor size was 7.8 cm, incision size 4.5 cm, operative time 152 min, EBL 100 ml, and hospital stay 2.5 days. Both patients had negative margins, and are alive at time of last follow-up. One did not require postoperative opiates. CONCLUSIONS LESS-RN-RVT is safe and feasible in selected patients with renal vein thrombi. Further accumulation of data and comparison to multiport laparoscopic technique are requisite.","Kopp, Ryan P; Silberstein, Jonathan L; Derweesh, Ithaar H",BMC urology,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2490-10-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20406459/,571

DESIGN Longitudinal. SETTING The Hemodialysis Study (HEMO Study) was a randomized, clinical trial of the effects of HD dose and membrane flux on mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing chronic dialysis. PARTICIPANTS Secondary analysis of the HEMO Study. MEASUREMENTS Participants completed the Index of Well-Being (IWB) and the Kidney Disease Quality of Life-Long Form (KDQOL-LF), which also includes the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Questionnaire (SF-36) annually. Changes in subjects those aged 70 and older were compared with changes in subjects aged 55 to 69 and 18 to 54. RESULTS At baseline, 1,813 (98%) of HEMO participants completed HRQOL surveys. Their mean age was 58, 56% were female, 64% were black, and mean duration of dialysis was 3.8 years. In subjects with HRQOL data at the first three annual assessments, there were no substantial mean declines in the SF-36 Physical or Mental Component Summary scales over 3 years. In models incorporating effects of attrition, the differences in average change over 3 years between patients undergoing HD aged 70 and older and the younger cohorts were small in magnitude. There were high rates of adverse HRQOL events in all age groups and significantly higher composite event rates of death or clinically significant decline in HRQOL over 3 years was found in subjects aged 70 and older. CONCLUSION Although HRQOL was impaired in the population undergoing HD, HRQOL scores at baseline reflect a better-preserved multidimensional quality of life in respondents in the HEMO Study aged 70 and older than in younger patients undergoing HD. There was no substantial relationship between age and average decline in HRQOL score over 3 years in participants in the HEMO Study.","Unruh, Mark L; Newman, Anne B; Larive, Brett; Dew, Mary Amanda; Miskulin, Dana C; Greene, Tom; Beddhu, Srinivasan; Rocco, Michael V; Kusek, John W; Meyer, Klemens B",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2008.01849.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18721224/,571

However, their clinical significance and associated factors remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to clarify the factors associated with VWCs in retrieved thrombi. METHODS Consecutive acute stroke patients treated endovascularly using the Penumbra aspiration catheter or stent retrievers (SRs) at our institute from November 2013 to April 2016 were retrospectively reviewed, and the retrieved thrombi were evaluated histopathologically. VWCs were defined as banded collagen fibers with a distinct boundary observed at the rim or outside of the retrieved thrombi. Factors associated with the presence of VWCs were studied. RESULTS A total of 150 specimens (76 specimens retrieved by the Penumbra, 74 by SRs) from 101 patients (47 women, age 74.9±11.1 years) were investigated. Applied thrombectomy devices were aspiration catheters in 42 patients, SRs in 21 patients, and both in 38 patients. VWCs were observed in 24 specimens (16%) from 22 patients. A low proportion of erythrocyte components (41.7±24.8% vs 55.0±26.3%, P=0.01), a high frequency of the devices reaching the M2/P2 (75% vs 50%, P=0.02), and a high number of device passages (P for trend=0.02) were associated with VWC positive thrombi. Successful recanalization (Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia ≥2b) tended to be less frequent in patients with VWC positive thrombi than in those without (73% vs 89%, P=0.06). CONCLUSIONS The histopathology of occlusive thrombi, arterial sites where devices reached, and number of device passages, might affect the presence of VWCs in retrieved thrombi.","Funatsu, Naoko; Hayakawa, Mikito; Hashimoto, Tetsuya; Yamagami, Hiroshi; Satow, Tetsu; Takahashi, Jun C; Koga, Masatoshi; Nagatsuka, Kazuyuki; Ishibashi-Ueda, Hatsue; Iwama, Toru; Toyoda, Kazunori",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2018-014041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30097483/,571

MERS was recently identified as a candidate for vaccine development, but most efforts focus on antibody responses, which are often transient after CoV infections. CoV-specific T cells are generally long-lived, but the virus-specific T cell response has not been addressed in MERS patients. We obtained peripheral blood mononuclear cells and/or sera from 21 MERS survivors. We detected MERS-CoV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in all MERS survivors and demonstrated functionality by measuring cytokine expression after peptide stimulation. Neutralizing (PRNT50) antibody titers measured in vitro predicted serum protective ability in infected mice and correlated with CD4+ but not CD8+ T cell responses; patients with higher PRNT50 and CD4+ T cell responses had longer intensive care unit stays and prolonged virus shedding and required ventilation. Survivors with undetectable MERS-CoV-specific antibody responses mounted CD8+ T cell responses comparable with those of the whole cohort. There were no correlations between age, disease severity, comorbidities, and virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses. In conclusion, measurements of MERS-CoV-specific T cell responses may be useful for predicting prognosis, monitoring vaccine efficacy, and identifying MERS patients with mild disease in epidemiological studies and will complement virus-specific antibody measurements.","Zhao, Jingxian; Alshukairi, Abeer N; Baharoon, Salim A; Ahmed, Waleed A; Bokhari, Ahmad A; Nehdi, Atef M; Layqah, Laila A; Alghamdi, Mohammed G; Al Gethamy, Manal M; Dada, Ashraf M; Khalid, Imran; Boujelal, Mohamad; Al Johani, Sameera M; Vogel, Leatrice; Subbarao, Kanta; Mangalam, Ashutosh; Wu, Chaorong; Ten Eyck, Patrick; Perlman, Stanley; Zhao, Jincun",Science immunology,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.aan5393; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28778905/,571

The aim of this study was to assess whether the extent of finger force enslaving changes with aging during a task that involves both static and dynamic phases. Ten right-handed young (22-30 years) and ten elderly subjects (67-79 years) were instructed to first exert a constant force (static phase) and then flex their index finger while counteracting constant resistance forces orthogonal to their fingertips (dynamic phase). The other fingers (non-instructed) were held in extension. EMG activities of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and extensor digitorum (ED) muscles in the regions corresponding to the index, middle and ring fingers together with their forces and position of index finger were measured. In both elderly and young, forces exerted by the non-instructed fingers increased (around 0.6 N for both young and elderly) during isotonic flexion of the index finger, but with a different delay of on average 100 ± 72 ms in elderly and 334 ± 101 ms in young subjects. Results also suggest different responses in activity of FDS and ED muscle regions of the non-instructed fingers to index finger flexion between elderly and young subjects. The enslaving effect was significantly higher in elderly than in young subjects both in the static (12% more) and dynamic (14% more) phases. These differences in enslaving can at least partly be explained by changes in neuromuscular control.","Mirakhorlo, M; Maas, H; Veeger, H E J",Experimental brain research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00221-018-5219-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29572650/,571
86937,Reducing Discomfort and Irritation Related to Surgical Loop Masks in the Era of COVID-19: A Quality Improvement Initiative.,2021-03-02,"Aconitine (ACO), a main active ingredient of Aconitum, is well-known for its cardiotoxicity. However, the mechanisms of toxic action of ACO remain unclear. In the current study, we investigated the cardiac effects of ACO and mesaconitine (MACO), a structurally related analog of ACO identified in Aconitum with undocumented cardiotoxicity in guinea pigs. We showed that intravenous administration of ACO or MACO (25 μg/kg) to guinea pigs caused various types of arrhythmias in electrocardiogram (ECG) recording, including ventricular premature beats (VPB), atrioventricular blockade (AVB), ventricular tachycardia (VT), and ventricular fibrillation (VF). MACO displayed more potent arrhythmogenic effect than ACO. We conducted whole-cell patch-clamp recording in isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes, and observed that treatment with ACO (0.3, 3 μM) or MACO (0.1, 0.3 μM) depolarized the resting membrane potential (RMP) and reduced the action potential amplitude (APA) and durations (APDs) in a concentration-dependent manner. The ACO- and MACO-induced AP remodeling was largely abolished by an INa blocker tetrodotoxin (2 μM) and partly abolished by a specific Na+/K+ pump (NKP) blocker ouabain (0.1 μM). Furthermore, we observed that treatment with ACO or MACO attenuated NKP current (INa/K) and increased peak INa by accelerating the sodium channel activation with the EC50 of 8.36 ± 1.89 and 1.33 ± 0.16 μM, respectively. Incubation of ventricular myocytes with ACO or MACO concentration-dependently increased intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates strong arrhythmogenic effects of ACO and MACO resulted from increasing the peak INa via accelerating sodium channel activation and inhibiting the INa/K. These results may help to improve our understanding of cardiotoxic mechanisms of ACO and MACO, and identify potential novel therapeutic targets for Aconitum poisoning.","Wang, Xiang-Chong; Jia, Qing-Zhong; Yu, Yu-Lou; Wang, Han-Dong; Guo, Hui-Cai; Ma, Xin-di; Liu, Chun-Tong; Chen, Xue-Yan; Miao, Qing-Feng; Guan, Bing-Cai; Su, Su-Wen; Wei, He-Ming; Wang, Chuan",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41401-020-0467-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747718/,571

Our method is based on monitoring DNA damage repair protein 53BP1 that forms radiation-induced foci (RIF) at locations of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) in the nucleus and comparing its expression in primary skin fibroblasts isolated from 15 mice strains. We previously reported strong evidence for clustering of nearby DSB into single repair units as opposed to the classic ""contact-first"" model where DSB are considered immobile. Here we apply this clustering model to evaluate the number of remaining RIF over time. We also show that the newly introduced kinetic metrics can be used as surrogate biomarkers for in vivo radiation toxicity, with potential applications in radiotherapy and human space exploration. In particular, we observed an association between the characteristic time constant of RIF repair measured in vitro and survival levels of immune cells collected from irradiated mice. Moreover, the speed of DNA damage repair correlated not only with radiation-induced cellular survival in vivo, but also with spontaneous cancer incidence data collected from the Mouse Tumor Biology database, suggesting a relationship between the efficiency of DSB repair after irradiation and cancer risk.","Pariset, Eloise; Penninckx, Sébastien; Kerbaul, Charlotte Degorre; Guiet, Elodie; Macha, Alejandra Lopez; Cekanaviciute, Egle; Snijders, Antoine M; Mao, Jian-Hua; Paris, François; Costes, Sylvain V",Radiation research,https://doi.org/10.1667/rade-20-00122.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991727/,571

90345,Time for a clear national COVID-19 strategy.,2020-12-08,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW CD4 T cell loss is the hallmark of uncontrolled HIV-1 infection. Strikingly, CD4 T cell depletion is a strong indicator for disease severity in the recently emerged coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We reviewed recent single-cell immune profiling studies in HIV-1 infection and COVID-19 to provide critical insight in virus-induced immunopathogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS Cytokine dysregulation in HIV-1 leads to chronic inflammation, while severe SARS-CoV-2 infection induces cytokine release syndrome and increased mortality. HIV-1-specific CD4 T cells are dysfunctional, while SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells exhibit robust Th1 function and correlate with protective antibody responses. In HIV-1 infection, follicular helper T cells (TFH) are susceptible to HIV-1 infection and persist in immune-sanctuary sites in lymphoid tissues as an HIV-1 reservoir. In severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, TFH are absent in lymphoid tissues and are associated with diminished protective immunity. Advancement in HIV-1 DNA, RNA, and protein-based single-cell capture methods can overcome the rarity and heterogeneity of HIV-1-infected cells and identify mechanisms of HIV-1 persistence and clonal expansion dynamics. SUMMARY Single-cell immune profiling identifies a high-resolution picture of immune dysregulation in HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection and informs outcome prediction and therapeutic interventions.","Collora, Jack A; Liu, Runxia; Albrecht, Kristen; Ho, Ya-Chi",Current opinion in HIV and AIDS,https://doi.org/10.1097/coh.0000000000000655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33165008/,571

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of 810 patients undergoing SILC from May 2009 to October 2016 at Osaka Police Hospital was performed, and the outcomes of the patients aged < 80 years and the patients ≥ 80 years were compared. RESULTS The median operative times of patients <80 years and patients ≥80 years were 100 min and 110 min, respectively (p = 0.4). The conversion rates to a different operative procedure (multi-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy or open cholecystectomy) were 3% (22/763) of patients < 80 years and 0% of patients ≥ 80 years (p = 0.6). Perioperative complications were seen in 6% (46/763) of patients < 80 years and 17% (8/47) of patients ≥ 80 years (p < 0.05). Pneumonia was seen in 0% (0/763) of patients < 80 years and 4% (3/47) of patients ≥ 80 years (p < 0.05). There was no mortality in either group. The median postoperative hospital stay was 4 days for patients <80 years and 5 days for patients ≥80 years (p < 0.05).

Timing and severity of influenza seasons contribute to those patterns, especially among vulnerable populations such as patients with ESRD. However, the extent to which influenza-like illness (ILI), a syndrome comprising a range of potentially serious respiratory tract infections, contributes to mortality in patients with ESRD has not been quantified. METHODS We used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ESRD death data from 2000 to 2013. After addressing the increasing trend in deaths due to the growing prevalent ESRD population, we calculated quarterly relative mortality compared with average third-quarter (summer) death counts. We used linear regression models to assess the relationship between ILI data and mortality, separately for quarters 4 and 1 for each influenza season, and model parameter estimates to predict seasonal mortality counts and calculate excess ILI-associated deaths. RESULTS An estimated 1% absolute increase in quarterly ILI was associated with a 1.5% increase in relative mortality for quarter 4 and a 2.0% increase for quarter 1. The average number of annual deaths potentially attributable to ILI was substantial, about 1100 deaths per year. CONCLUSIONS We found an association between community ILI activity and seasonal variation in all-cause mortality in patients with ESRD, with ILI likely contributing to >1000 deaths annually. Surveillance efforts, such as timely reporting to the CDC of ILI activity within dialysis units during influenza season, may help focus attention on high-risk periods for this vulnerable population.","Gilbertson, David T; Rothman, Kenneth J; Chertow, Glenn M; Bradbury, Brian D; Brookhart, M Alan; Liu, Jiannong; Winkelmayer, Wolfgang C; Stürmer, Til; Monda, Keri L; Herzog, Charles A; Ashfaq, Akhtar; Collins, Allan J; Wetmore, James B",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.2018060581; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679380/,571

The presence of PJK was quantified on radiographs using the proximal junctional angle (PJA > 10° at the last follow-up). The authors propose a new radiological parameter to measure the angulation of the proximal part of the instrumentation: the proximal contouring rod angle (PCRA) is the angle between the upper endplate of the upper instrumented vertebra (UIV) and the lower endplate of the second vertebra caudal to the UIV. The patients were analyzed according to the presence or absence of PJK. A t-test, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and logistic regression analysis were performed for statistical analysis. RESULTS Sixty-two patients treated for SK were included in this study. The mean age was 18.6 ± 8.5 years, and the mean follow-up was 42.5 ± 16.4 months. The mean correction rate of global kyphosis was 46.4% ± 13.7%. At the last follow-up, 17 patients (27.4%) presented with PJK. No significant difference was found between the PJK and non-PJK groups in terms of age and other preoperative variables. A significant difference in the postoperative PCRA was found between the PJK and non-PJK groups (8.2° ± 4.9° vs 15.7° ± 6.6°, respectively; p = 0.001). A postoperative PCRA less than 10.1° predicted a significantly higher risk for PJK (p = 0.002, OR 2.431, 95% CI 1.781-4.133). CONCLUSIONS Under-contouring of the proximal part of the rods (lower than 10°) is a risk factor for PJK after posterior correction of SK.","Grelat, Michael; Du, Chang-Zhi; Xu, Liang; Sun, Xu; Qiu, Yong",Journal of neurosurgery.

METHODS A 59-year-old African American woman with a past history of T3N2M1 colon cancer, who underwent laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy and wedge liver resection (segment IV A) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy was our subject for this study. Twelve months later, she was found to have a positron emission tomography positive liver lesion of 6.5 cm at the left lateral liver segment. A combined laparoscopic-transvaginal approach was used. Four 5-mm trocars were used. The liver parenchyma was divided using the harmonic scalpel, whereas the left hepatic vein was transected using the laparoscopic transvaginal vascular stapler. The specimen was placed in an endobag and extracted transvaginally. The specimen size was 14×8×3.5 cm and that of the lesion was 6.5×5.7×4 cm. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 2. RESULTS Operative time was 120 minutes and blood loss was minimal. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 2. No postoperative complications were found after 30 days. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic-assisted natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery results in quicker recovery, less postoperative pain, and potential wound-related complications.

96806,Covid-19: Israel sees new infections plummet following vaccinations.,2021-02-04,"Background Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has the characteristics of multitarget and overall regulation, which has certain advantages in preventing and treating of metabolic syndrome (MS). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the similarities and differences of TCM syndrome distribution in different age groups to promote the optimization of treatment strategies. Methods This study was based on a real-world survey conducted in 3 hospitals in China. There are 1262 collected cases of MS meeting the inclusion criteria, which were divided into the young group, middle-aged group, and elderly group. Factor analysis (FA) was conducted for syndrome element extraction, and K-means cluster analysis was processed for syndrome type classification. Frequency analysis and Chi-square test were used to compare the syndrome characteristics of each group. Results Common factors extracted were assigned to 18 syndrome elements including 11 nature syndrome elements and 7 location syndrome elements. Phlegm and dampness are the most frequent syndrome elements in general. Compared with the middle-aged group and elderly group, the young group has more obvious nature syndrome elements in heat and Qi deficiency, and location syndrome elements in the stomach. As for the middle-aged group, the frequency of location syndrome in kidney syndrome was higher than that in other groups. When it comes to the elderly group, it is shown that the symptoms of Yin deficiency and blood deficiency increase with age and the old patients may have more location syndrome elements in the lung and gallbladder. Conclusion The TCM syndrome of MS is complex in that there may be the characteristics of deficiency and excess syndrome simultaneously. The main pathological factors of MS were phlegm and dampness. Besides, MS patients at different age periods may have their own syndrome distribution features. So, it is reasonable to adhere to the method of resolving phlegm and removing dampness and, at the same time, adopt the ways of clearing heat, promoting Qi, nourishing Yin, supplementing blood as well as regulating the liver, promoting the lung, transporting the spleen, nourishing the heart, and nourishing the kidney based on the syndrome feature of MS in different age stages.","Xia, Shujie; Cai, Jing; Chen, Jianxin; Lin, Xuejuan; Chen, Shujiao; Gao, Bizhen; Li, Candong",Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/7854325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724328/,571

98217,"The EMA covid-19 data leak, and what it tells us about mRNA instability.",2021-03-10,"BACKGROUND Human rhinovirus (HRV) is classified into A, B, and C genogroups. HRVs cause mild upper respiratory infections, but HRV-C was recently found to be a major cause of asthma exacerbation in whites. This study elucidated disease spectrum of HRV infections among Hong Kong children hospitalized with respiratory illnesses. METHODS This retrospective study recruited 128 children with asthma exacerbations and 192 inpatient controls without allergy and hospitalized for respiratory illnesses within the same week. Their clinical information was retrieved from case records. HRVs in nasopharyngeal aspirates were detected by molecular assays using primers targeting consensus VP4/VP2 coding regions, and their genogroups identified by sequencing. RESULTS The mean (standard deviation) age of cases and controls was 5.6 (3.6) years and 5.4 (3.8) years, respectively (P = 0.601). HRV was detected in 107 (84.9%) cases and 63 (33.0%) controls (P < 0.0001), and HRV-C in 69.8% and 18.8% of these groups, respectively (P < 0.0001). Detection of HRV-A and -B was similar between these groups (P > 0.15). More subjects with HRV-C needed oxygen supplementation (11.1% vs. 2.6%; P = 0.043). Among controls, HRV infection was associated with acute bronchiolitis (P < 0.001) and bronchitis (P = 0.04), which paralleled those of HRV-C. HRV-A was associated with acute bronchiolitis (P = 0.005). Phylogenetic analysis revealed a diverse group of HRV serotypes (21 for HRV-A, 2 for HRV-B, and 32 for HRV-C). CONCLUSIONS HRV-C is associated with asthma exacerbation, whereas the presence of all HRVs, or either HRV-A or HRV-C alone, is associated with wheezing respiratory infections in nonasthmatic children. HRV is an important respiratory virus responsible for childhood wheezing illnesses.","Mak, Rainbow K Y; Tse, Lai Y; Lam, Wai Y; Wong, Gary W K; Chan, Paul K S; Leung, Ting F",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e31821b8c71; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21494174/,571
98226,Legislative preparedness for the control of pandemics - using Taiwan as an example.,2020-11-17,"INTRODUCTION Perioperative benzodiazepines are used because of their anxiolytic, sedative and amnestic effects. Evidence has demonstrated an association of benzodiazepines with adverse neuropsychiatric effects. Nonetheless, because of their potential benefits, perioperative benzodiazepines continue to be used routinely. We seek to evaluate the body of evidence of the risks and benefits of benzodiazepine use during the perioperative period. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science from inception to March 2019 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies evaluating the administration of benzodiazepine medications as compared with all other medications (or nothing) in patients undergoing cardiac and non-cardiac surgery. We will exclude studies assessing the use of benzodiazepines for procedural sedation or day surgery. We will examine the impact of giving these medications before, during and after surgery. Outcomes of interest include the incidence of delirium, duration of delirium, postprocedure cognitive change, the incidence of intraoperative awareness, patient satisfaction/quality of life/quality of recovery, length-of-stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU), hospital LOS and in-hospital mortality.Reviewers will screen references and assess eligibility using predefined criteria independently and in duplicate. Two reviewers will independently collect data using prepiloted forms. We will present results separately for RCTs and observational studies. We will pool data using a random effect model and present results as relative risk with 95% CIs for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. We will pool adjusted ORs for observational studies. We will assess risk of bias for individual studies using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for RCTs. For observational studies, we will use tools designed by the Clinical Advances through Research and Information Translation group. Quality of evidence for each outcome will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This systematic review involves no patient contact and no interaction with healthcare providers or systems. As such, we did not seek ethics board approval. We will disseminate the findings of our systematic review through the presentation at peer-reviewed conferences and by seeking publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

METHODS A case-control study of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan Third Hospital was conducted. 96 deceased COVID-19 patients and 230 discharged patients were included as the case group and control group, respectively. Demographic, epidemiological, clinical and laboratory variables on admission were collected from electronic medical records. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were adopted to investigate the independent predictors of mortality. A nomogram was formed for predicting the mortality risk. RESULTS The multivariate stepwise logistic model demonstrated that age of 60+ years (OR =4.426, 95% CI: 1.955-10.019), comorbidity of cerebrovascular disease (OR =7.084, 95% CI: 1.545-32.471), white blood cell (WBC) count >9.5×109 /L (OR =7.308, 95% CI: 1.650-32.358), platelet count <125×109/L (OR =5.128, 95% CI: 2.157-12.191), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >40 U/L (OR =2.554, 95% CI: 1.253-5.206), cystatin C >1.1 mg/L (OR =4.132, 95% CI: 2.118-8.059), C reactive protein (CRP) ≥100 mg/L (OR =2.830, 95% CI: 1.311-6.109), creatine kinase isoenzymes (CK-MB) >24 U/L (OR =6.015, 95% CI: 2.119-17.07) and D-dimer >5 μg/L (OR =4.917, 95% CI: 1.619-14.933) were independent predictors of mortality of COVID-19 patients.

98687,Covid-19: How will a waiver on vaccine patents affect global supply?,2021-05-10,"Coronavirus spike proteins from different genera are divergent, although they all mediate coronavirus entry into cells by binding to host receptors and fusing viral and cell membranes. Here, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of porcine deltacoronavirus (PdCoV) spike protein at 3.3-Å resolution. The trimeric protein contains three receptor-binding S1 subunits that tightly pack into a crown-like structure and three membrane fusion S2 subunits that form a stalk. Each S1 subunit contains two domains, an N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) and C-terminal domain (S1-CTD). PdCoV S1-NTD has the same structural fold as alpha- and betacoronavirus S1-NTDs as well as host galectins, and it recognizes sugar as its potential receptor. PdCoV S1-CTD has the same structural fold as alphacoronavirus S1-CTDs, but its structure differs from that of betacoronavirus S1-CTDs. PdCoV S1-CTD binds to an unidentified receptor on host cell surfaces. PdCoV S2 is locked in the prefusion conformation by structural restraint of S1 from a different monomeric subunit. PdCoV spike possesses several structural features that may facilitate immune evasion by the virus, such as its compact structure, concealed receptor-binding sites, and shielded critical epitopes. Overall, this study reveals that deltacoronavirus spikes are structurally and evolutionally more closely related to alphacoronavirus spikes than to betacoronavirus spikes; it also has implications for the receptor recognition, membrane fusion, and immune evasion by deltacoronaviruses as well as coronaviruses in general. IMPORTANCE In this study, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of porcine deltacoronavirus (PdCoV) spike protein at a 3.3-Å resolution. This is the first atomic structure of a spike protein from the deltacoronavirus genus, which is divergent in amino acid sequences from the well-studied alpha- and betacoronavirus spike proteins. Here, we described the overall structure of the PdCoV spike and the detailed structure of each of its structural elements. Moreover, we analyzed the functions of each of the structural elements. Based on the structures and functions of these structural elements, we discussed the evolution of PdCoV spike protein in relation to the spike proteins from other coronavirus genera. This study combines the structure, function, and evolution of PdCoV spike protein and provides many insights into its receptor recognition, membrane fusion, and immune evasion.","Shang, Jian; Zheng, Yuan; Yang, Yang; Liu, Chang; Geng, Qibin; Tai, Wanbo; Du, Lanying; Zhou, Yusen; Zhang, Wei; Li, Fang",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01556-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29070693/,571

The present study was performed to investigate the effect of dexamethasone (DEX) on acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by the H5N1 viral infection in mice. BALB/c mice, 6-8 weeks old, were divided into three groups with 80 mice in each. The infected group and the DEX-treated infected group were inoculated intranasally with 1 x 10(2) 50% mouse infectious dose of A/Chicken/Hebei/108/2002 (H5N1) viruses, with daily intraperitoneal injections of PBS, or 2.5 mg.kg(-1) DEX at days 3-14 post inoculation, respectively. The control group received noninfectious allantoic fluid and a daily intraperitoneal injection of PBS. In H5N1-infected mice, DEX treatment did not improve the mortality (17 out of 20 versus 16 out of 20 deaths in the DEX-treated infected group versus the infected group), and did not alleviate clinical signs, including weight loss, decreased food intake and inactivity. There was no significant amelioration of the hypoxaemia and ARDS-associated pathological changes in DEX-treated infected mice, as assessed by blood gas analysis and histological score. Furthermore, DEX therapy did not inhibit inflammatory cellular infiltration and cytokine release (interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid induced by the H5N1 infection. In conclusion, dexamethasone treatment (2.5 mg.kg(-1)) from days 3-14 post inoculation has no beneficial effect on acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by the H5N1 infection in mice.","Xu, T; Qiao, J; Zhao, L; He, G; Li, K; Wang, J; Tian, Y; Wang, H",The European respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00130507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19129272/,571
100696,Autologous Epidural Blood Patch in a Coronavirus Disease 2019-Positive Patient: Ethical Issues.,2020-11-01,"OBJECTIVE Despite weight loss challenges in young adulthood, 17% of participants in the Study of Novel Approaches to Weight Gain Prevention (SNAP) weight gain prevention study lost ≥ 5% of their body weight at 3 years. These ""weight losers"" (n = 88) were compared to ""weight maintainers"" (n = 143), who successfully prevented weight gains by staying within ± 2.5% of their baseline weight at 3 years. METHOD Weight losers and maintainers (n = 231; 18-35 years old) were drawn from the SNAP randomized controlled trial (n = 599), which compared two weight gain prevention interventions with a control group. Participants completed anthropometric and psychosocial assessments at baseline, 4 months (end of face-to-face intervention), and 1, 2, and 3 years. RESULTS Three-year weight losers had significantly greater weight losses than maintainers by 4 months, and weight trajectories continued to diverge. Three-year weight change group was not associated with treatment assignment. At pretreatment, weight losers were heavier, closer to their self-reported highest ever weight, and further away from their self-identified ideal weight. Across treatment, weight losers had greater dietary restraint and autonomous motivation, had lower disinhibition and self-identified ideal weight, and self-weighed more frequently than weight maintainers. CONCLUSIONS Weight gain prevention messaging may be sufficient to initiate weight loss in a subset of young adults who are heavier and closer to their highest weight at baseline. Psychological and behavioral characteristics more consistent with weight loss may explain differences in weight outcomes between losers and maintainers at 3 years. Future studies may consider the effects of weight gain prevention versus weight loss messaging in tailoring weight control interventions for young adults.

In the cellular environment many proteins and protein complexes are associated with microtubules that influence or functionalize microtubule dynamics. Therefore, investigation of the structure and dynamics of microtubules with their associated complexes inside the cellular environment lies at the heart of fully understanding their function. Cryo electron microscopy has been essential in structural microtubule research since the atomic structure of tubulin and the structure of microtubules were unraveled using this technique. Furthermore, the specific structures at the microtubule ends linked to the growing or shrinking states were also detected by cryo electron microscopy. Electron microscopy studies on microtubules were mainly performed in vitro but microtubules can also be investigated inside cells, using cryo electron tomography. Cryo electron tomography is an important tool in structural biology research because it enables visualization of single and unique protein complexes in a cellular environment and at a molecular resolution.

103352,"Covid-19: Official data on England are patchy, say researchers behind new evaluation dashboard.",2020-10-28,"The term atypical pneumonia was first used in 1938, and by the 1970s it was widely used to refer to pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila (or other Legionella species), and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. However, in the purest sense all pneumonias other than the classic bacterial pneumonias are atypical. Currently many favor abolition of the term atypical pneumonia.This review categorizes atypical pneumonia pathogens as conventional ones; viral agents and emerging atypical pneumonia pathogens. We emphasize viral pneumonia because with the increasing availability of multiplex polymerase chain reaction we can identify the agent(s) responsible for viral pneumonia. By using a sensitive assay for procalcitonin one can distinguish between viral and bacterial pneumonia. This allows pneumonia to be categorized as bacterial or viral at the time of admission to hospital or at discharge from the emergency department and soon thereafter further classified as to the etiology, which should be stated as definite or probable.","Marrie, Thomas J; Costain, Nicholas; La Scola, Bernard; Patrick, Ward; Forgie, Sarah; Xu, Zhaolin; McNeil, Shelly A",Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0032-1315636; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22718210/,571

The goal of NPIs - decreasing mobility in order to decrease contact - comes with competing socioeconomic costs and incentives that are not well-understood. Using Google's Community Mobility data, we visualized changes in mobility and explored the effect of economic, social, and governmental factors on mobility via regression. We found decreases in mobility for all movement categories except in residential areas; these changes corresponded strongly with country-specific outbreak trajectory. Mobility increased with GDP per capita, though this relationship varied among movement categories. Finally, countries with more authoritarian governments were more responsive with respect to mobility changes as local case counts increased; however, these countries were also less likely to report mobility data to Google. ​These preliminary findings suggest that country-specific outbreak trajectory, GDP per capita, and democracy index may be important indicators in assessing a given population's adherence to NPIs.","M Herren, Cristina; K Brownwright, Tenley; Y Liu, Erin; El Amiri, Nisrine; Majumder, Maimuna S",SSRN,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3570206; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32714111/,571

We share our experiences of a virtual multidisciplinary sarcoma case conference (VMSCC). METHODS We conducted retrospective review of the VMSCC data-initially via Webex, now Microsoft Teams-and the surveys of referring physicians to understand the feasibility and value of the VMSCC. RESULTS The VMSCC was established in March 2013 in Kaiser Permanente Northern California with consistent participation of the Departments of Musculoskeletal Oncology (orthopedic oncology), Musculoskeletal Radiology, Pathology, Medical Oncology, Radiation Oncology, Nuclear Medicine, Surgical Oncology, and Genetics. Pediatric Oncology participated ad hoc when pediatric sarcoma cases were presented. Referrals were from multiple specialties and regions, including the Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic and Hawaii regions. From March 2013 to December 2019, 1,585 cases were reviewed encompassing 36 histologic types. More than 300 cases were reviewed per year from 2017 to 2019. Survey results of referring physicians demonstrate that the VMSCC enhanced the confidence of treating physicians, and its recommendations frequently led to treatment changes. CONCLUSION Establishing a valuable community-based VMSCC is feasible. VMSCC recommendations frequently led to treatment changes and improved the confidence of treating physicians.","Pan, Minggui; Seto, Tiffany; Yu, Jeanette; Sidhu, Manpreet; Kim, Brian; McCormick, Craig; Fang, Andrew; Song, Joseph; Morse, Lee Jae; Peng, Peter D; Chakedis, Jeffery; Huber, Ryan; Schwartz, Corey; Lee, Jason D; Zou, Youran",JCO oncology practice,https://doi.org/10.1200/op.20.00110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530806/,571

Assessment of gastrointestinal motility in these patients can serve to establish diagnosis and to guide therapy. Major advances in diagnostic techniques during the past 5-10 years have led to this update about indications for and selection and performance of currently available tests. As symptoms have poor concordance with gastrointestinal motor dysfunction, clinical motility testing is indicated in patients in whom there is no evidence of causative mucosal or structural diseases such as inflammatory or malignant disease. Transit tests using radiopaque markers, scintigraphy, breath tests and wireless motility capsules are noninvasive. Other tests of gastrointestinal contractility or sensation usually require intubation, typically represent second-line investigations limited to patients with severe symptoms and are performed at only specialized centres. This Consensus Statement details recommended tests as well as useful clinical alternatives for investigation of gastric, small bowel and colonic motility. The article provides recommendations on how to classify gastrointestinal motor disorders on the basis of test results and describes how test results guide treatment decisions.","Keller, Jutta; Bassotti, Gabrio; Clarke, John; Dinning, Phil; Fox, Mark; Grover, Madhusudan; Hellström, Per M; Ke, Meiyun; Layer, Peter; Malagelada, Carolina; Parkman, Henry P; Scott, S Mark; Tack, Jan; Simren, Magnus; Törnblom, Hans; Camilleri, Michael",Nature reviews.

This study examined the incidence, time course and predictive value of PGD after living-donor lobar lung transplantation (LDLLT). METHODS We retrospectively investigated 75 patients (42 with LDLLT and 33 with CLT) who underwent lung transplantation from January 2008 to December 2013. Patients were assigned PGD grades at six time points, as defined by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: immediately after final reperfusion, upon arrival at the intensive care unit (ICU), and 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after ICU admission. RESULTS The incidence of severe (Grade 3) PGD at 48 or 72 h after ICU admission was similar for LDLLT and CLT patients (16.7 vs 12.1%; P = 0.581). The majority of the LDLLT patients having severe PGD first developed PGD immediately after reperfusion, whereas more than half of the CLT patients first developed severe PGD upon ICU arrival or later. In LDLLT patients, severe PGD immediately after reperfusion was significantly associated with fewer ventilator-free days during the first 28 postoperative days [median (interquartile range) of 0 (0-10) vs 21 (13-25) days, P = 0.001], prolonged postoperative ICU stay [median (interquartile range) of 20 (16-27) vs 12 (8-14) days, P = 0.005] and increased hospital mortality (27.3 vs 3.2%, P = 0.02). Severe PGD immediately after reperfusion was not associated with ventilator-free days during the first 28 postoperative days, time to discharge from ICU or hospital, or hospital mortality in CLT patients. CONCLUSIONS Postoperative incidence of severe PGD was not significantly different between LDLLT and CLT patients. In LDLLT patients, the onset of severe PGD tended to be earlier than that in CLT patients. Severe PGD immediately after reperfusion was a significant predictor of postoperative morbidity and mortality in LDLLT patients but not in CLT patients.","Mizota, Toshiyuki; Miyao, Mariko; Yamada, Tetsu; Sato, Masaaki; Aoyama, Akihiro; Chen, Fengshi; Date, Hiroshi; Fukuda, Kazuhiko",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/icvts/ivv357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26705301/,571

108206,Covid-19: £150m worth of masks bought without tender by government are unusable.,2020-08-06,"UNLABELLED Human norovirus infection is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis worldwide. Development of an effective vaccine is required for reducing norovirus outbreaks. The inability to grow human norovirus in cell culture has hindered the development of live-attenuated vaccines. To overcome this obstacle, we generated a recombinant Newcastle disease virus (rNDV)-vectored experimental norovirus vaccine by expressing the capsid protein (VP1) of norovirus strain VA387. We compared two different NDV vectors, a conventional rNDV vector and a modified rNDV vector, for their efficiencies in expressing VP1 protein. Our results showed that the modified vector replicated to higher titers and expressed higher levels of VP1 protein in DF1 cells and in allantoic fluid of embryonated chicken eggs than did the conventional vector. We further demonstrated that the VP1 protein produced by rNDVs was able to self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs) that are morphologically similar to baculovirus-expressed VLPs. Evaluation of their immunogenicity in mice showed that the modified rNDV vector induced a higher level of IgG response than those induced by the conventional vector and by the baculovirus-expressed VLPs. The rNDV vectors predominantly induced IgG2a subclass antibody for the Th1 response, and specifically, high levels of gamma interferon (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-2 (IL-2) were detected in splenocytes. In addition, the modified rNDV vector induced a higher level of fecal IgA response in mice than did baculovirus-expressed VLPs. Our findings suggest that the rNDV vector is an efficient system to produce cost-effective VLPs in embryonated chicken eggs and has the potential to be used as a live-attenuated vaccine in humans. IMPORTANCE Noroviruses are the major cause of viral gastroenteritis worldwide. Currently, effective vaccines against norovirus infection are not available. In this study, we have evaluated Newcastle disease virus (NDV) as a vaccine vector for norovirus. Our results suggest that NDV can be used not only as a cost-effective method for large-scale production of norovirus-like particle vaccines but also as a live-attenuated vectored vaccine.","Kim, Shin-Hee; Chen, Shun; Jiang, Xi; Green, Kim Y; Samal, Siba K",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01570-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24920815/,571

The present study focuses on the demographic, clinical and laboratory profile of such patients from a tertiary level non-COVID respiratory care hospital. This is a retrospective observational study. Seventy-seven sick patients fulfilling COVID suspect criteria were admitted to the isolation area. Their RT-PCR test was done from the designated laboratory and 35 of them were confirmed to be COVID-19 patients. The detailed demographic, clinical and laboratory profile of these COVID-19 patients was studied. The mean age was 46±17 years with male predominance (57%). Majority of the cases (83%) were symptomatic. The most common symptom was cough (66%) followed by breathlessness and fever. Nineteen (54.3%) patients had one or the other co-morbidity and 16 (45.7%) had chronic lung diseases as one of the comorbidities. Nearly half of the patients (51%) required supplementary oxygen on presentation. Two patients were put on invasive mechanical ventilation while 4 patients required non-invasive ventilation before being shifted to the COVID hospital. Hence, it can be concluded that COVID-19 in patients of chronic respiratory diseases manifests with higher prevalence of symptoms and also higher severity of disease. Further, the symptomatology of COVID-19 closely mimics the acute exacerbation of chronic lung diseases, so cautious screening and testing should be done, especially at the pulmonary department.","Goel, Nitin; Spalgais, Sonam; Mrigpuri, Parul; Khanna, Madhu; Menon, Balakrishnan; Kumar, Raj",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2020.1568; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33169599/,571

111257,My journey through COVID-19.,2020-07-23,"INTRODUCTION The prevalence of tobacco smoking in pregnancy remains elevated in some disadvantaged populations of women. One group is those who use alcohol and/or other psychoactive substances during pregnancy, with tobacco use prevalence estimates ranging from 71% to 95%. Although effective evidence-based cessation treatments exist, few women with co-occurring substance use problems successfully stop smoking during pregnancy. There is limited information about treatments that specifically target this group and a summary of the available research is required to assist and enhance the development of innovative cessation interventions. This article describes a protocol for a comprehensive review of studies that have trialled behavioural and/or pharmacological tobacco cessation interventions in populations of pregnant women who are nicotine dependent and use alcohol and/or other psychoactive substances. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The review will undertake literature searches in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE and ProQuest databases, as well as the grey literature. Studies of any design methodology will be included if they describe changes to tobacco smoking behaviours in quantitative terms. No restriction on year of publication or published language will apply. Participants include pregnant women of any age, who smoke tobacco, who are seeking or having treatment, or in post-treatment recovery for the use of psychoactive substances. Interventions are any psychological, behavioural or pharmacological treatments used to treat tobacco use. Outcome measures are any that quantitatively report abstinence or reductions in participant tobacco consumption. Key details and tobacco-related outcomes from included studies will be extracted and tabulated before being narratively synthesised.

TBI patients suffer short- and long-term behavioral, cognitive, and emotional impairments, including difficulties in concentration, memory loss, and depression. Research shows that CE application can mitigate cognitive and behavioral impairments in animal models for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, whose pathophysiology is similar to that of TBI. This study builds on prior research by showing similar results in TBI mice models. After drinking CE for a week, mice were injured using our 70-g weight drop TBI device. For 2 weeks thereafter, the mice continued drinking CE alongside standard lab nutrition. Subsequently, the mice underwent behavioral tests to assess their memory, motor activity, and anxiety. The mice brains were harvested for immunohistochemistry staining to evaluate overall neuronal survival. Our results show that CE consumption almost completely mitigates memory impairment and decreases neuronal loss after TBI. Mice that did not consume CE demonstrated impaired memory. Our results also show that CE consumption attenuated neuronal loss in the temporal cortex and the dentate gyrus. Mice that did not consume CE suffered a significant neuronal loss. There were no significant differences in anxiety levels and motor activity between all groups. These findings show a new therapeutic approach to improve cognitive function and decrease memory loss after TBI.","Qubty, Doaa; Rubovitch, Vardit; Benromano, Tali; Ovadia, Michael; Pick, Chaim G",Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12031-020-01688-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901372/,571

113256,Covid-19: Logistical problems frustrate GPs ready to deliver vaccine in England.,2020-12-15,"OBJECTIVES Investment in digital interventions for mental health conditions is growing rapidly, offering the potential to elevate systems that are currently overstretched. Despite a growing literature on economic evaluation of digital mental health interventions (DMHIs), including several systematic reviews, there is no conclusive evidence regarding their cost-effectiveness. This paper reviews the methodology used to determine their cost-effectiveness and assesses whether this meets the requirements for decision-making. In doing so we consider the challenges specific to the economic evaluation of DMHIs, and identify where consensus and possible further research is warranted. METHODS A systematic review was conducted to identify all economic evaluations of DMHIs published between 1997 and December 2018. The searches included databases of published and unpublished research, reference lists and citations of all included studies, forward citations on all identified protocols and conference abstracts, and contacting authors researchers in the field. The identified studies were critiqued against a published set of requirements for decision-making in healthcare, identifying methodological challenges and areas where consensus is required. RESULTS The review identified 67 papers evaluating DMHIs. The majority of the evaluations were conducted alongside trials, failing to capture all relevant available evidence and comparators, and long-term impact of mental health disorders. The identified interventions are complex and heterogeneous. As a result, there are a number of challenges specific to their evaluation, including estimation of all costs and outcomes, conditional on analysis viewpoint, and identification of relevant comparators. A taxonomy for DMHIs may be required to inform what interventions can reasonably be pooled and compared. CONCLUSIONS This study represents the first attempt to understand the appropriateness of the methodologies used to evaluate the value for money of DMHIs, helping work towards consensus and methods' harmonisation on these complex interventions.","Jankovic, Dina; Bojke, Laura; Marshall, David; Saramago Goncalves, Pedro; Churchill, Rachel; Melton, Hollie; Brabyn, Sally; Gega, Lina",Applied health economics and health policy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-020-00607-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803521/,571

Because past research on antecedents of unethical behavior has not provided a clear answer, we turned to machine learning to generate novel hypotheses. We trained a deep-learning model to predict whether or not World Values Survey respondents perceived unethical behaviors as justifiable, on the basis of their responses to 708 other items. The model identified optimism about the future of humanity as one of the top predictors of unethicality. A preregistered correlational study (N = 218 U.S. residents) conceptually replicated this finding. A preregistered experiment (N = 294 U.S. residents) provided causal support: Participants who read a scenario conveying optimism about the COVID-19 pandemic were less willing to justify hoarding and violating social-distancing guidelines than participants who read a scenario conveying pessimism. The findings suggest that optimism can help reduce unethicality, and they document the utility of machine-learning methods for generating novel hypotheses.","Sheetal, Abhishek; Feng, Zhiyu; Savani, Krishna",Psychological science,https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797620959594; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32926807/,571

114757,Covid-19: School staff testing positive for antibodies rose to around 15% in December.,2021-03-01,"The potential for a simple, non-invasive measure of respiratory effort based on the pulse oximeter signal - the photoplethysmogram or 'pleth' - was investigated in a pilot study. Several parameters were developed based on a variety of manifestations of respiratory effort in the signal, including modulation changes in amplitude, baseline, frequency and pulse transit times, as well as distinct baseline signal shifts. Thirteen candidate parameters were investigated using data from healthy volunteers. Each volunteer underwent a series of controlled respiratory effort maneuvers at various set flow resistances and respiratory rates. Six oximeter probes were tested at various body sites. In all, over three thousand pleth-based effort-airway pressure (EP) curves were generated across the various airway constrictions, respiratory efforts, respiratory rates, subjects, probe sites, and the candidate parameters considered. Regression analysis was performed to determine the existence of positive monotonic relationships between the respiratory effort parameters and resulting airway pressures. Six of the candidate parameters investigated exhibited a distinct positive relationship (p<0.001 across all probes tested) with increasing upper airway pressure repeatable across the range of respiratory rates and flow constrictions studied. These were: the three fundamental modulations in amplitude (AM-Effort), baseline (BM-Effort) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA-Effort); two pulse transit time modulations - one using a pulse oximeter probe and an ECG (P2E-Effort) and the other using two pulse oximeter probes placed at different peripheral body sites (P2-Effort); and baseline shifts in heart rate, (BL-HR-Effort). In conclusion, a clear monotonic relationship was found between several pleth-based parameters and imposed respiratory loadings at the mouth across a range of respiratory rates and flow constrictions. The results suggest that the pleth may provide a measure of changing upper airway dynamics indicative of the effort to breathe.","Addison, Paul S",Medical engineering & physics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medengphy.2016.12.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28126420/,571
115136,Comparison of students' performance of objective structured clinical examination during clinical practice.,2020-07-21,"BACKGROUND A significant number of patients use opioids prior to total joint arthroplasty (TJA) in North America and there is growing concern that preoperative opioid use negatively impacts postoperative patient outcomes after surgery. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the current evidence investigating the influence of preoperative opioid use on postoperative patient-reported outcomes (PRO) after total joint arthroplasty. METHODS A systematic search was performed using Ovid, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, CINAHL on February 15th, 2018. Studies reporting baseline and postoperative PRO among those prescribed preoperative opioids and those who were not prior to total knee and hip arthroplasty were included. Standardized mean differences (SMD) in absolute difference and relative change in PRO measures between the two groups was calculated using random effect models. RESULTS Six studies were included (n = 7356 patients); overall 24% of patients were prescribed preoperative opioids. Patients with preoperative opioid use had worse absolute postoperative PRO scores when compared to those with no preoperative opioid use (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.53, 95% Confidence interval (CI) -0.75, - 0.32, p < 0.0001). When relative change in PRO score was analyzed, as measured by difference between postoperative and preoperative PRO scores, there was no group differences (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.56, 0.05, p = 0.10). CONCLUSION Patients prescribed preoperative opioids may attain worse overall pain and function benefits after TJA when compared to opioid-naïve patients, but do still benefit from undergoing TJA. These results suggest preoperative opioid users should be judiciously counselled regarding potential postoperative pain and function improvements after TJA.","Goplen, C Michael; Verbeek, Wesley; Kang, Sung Hyun; Jones, C Allyson; Voaklander, Donald C; Churchill, Thomas A; Beaupre, Lauren A",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12891-019-2619-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103029/,571

Although most tumours initially respond to this therapy, some will be acquired resistant and progress to metastatic castration-resistant (mCRPC) disease which clinically tends to progress more rapidly than earlier disease manifestations. The underlying molecular biology of mCRPC is highly complex, and numerous mechanisms have been proposed that promote and retain androgen independence. In various clinical and preclinical data explored, the nature of intracellular signalling pathways mediating mitogenic acquired resistant effects of GPCRs in prostate cancer is poorly defined. G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) contributes to the modulation of basic cellular functions-such as cell proliferation, survival, or motility-and is involved in metabolic homeostasis, inflammation, or angiogenic processes. Moreover, altered GRK2 levels are starting to be reported in different tumoural contexts and shown to promote breast tumourigenesis or to trigger the tumoural angiogenic switch. Thus, we are exploring recent findings that present unexpected opportunities to interfere with major tumourigenic signals by manipulating GPCR-mediated pathways.","Tian, Jing-Yan; Chi, Chang-Liang; Bian, Ge; Guo, Feng-Jun; Wang, Xiao-Qing; Yu, Bing",Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bcpt.13499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991779/,571
117426,"Covid-19: benefit for death in service may not go far enough, warns BMA.",2020-04-28,"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The maintenance of cognitive health is an important component of healthy aging. Abnormal cognitive decline can signal the onset of dementing disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Normal cognitive decline can also adversely affect the health of aging populations. We investigated the association between religious/spiritual involvement (R/SI) and cognitive function in adults of any age and any setting. We also examined whether social engagement acts as a mediator or moderator of the effect of R/SI on cognitive function, and whether the association between R/SI and cognitive function differs according to how each of these constructs is measured. DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a systematic review of articles published between 1990 and September 2016 by searching OVID MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO, EMBASE, and Google Advanced Search. We included studies with a comparison group (cohort, case-control, cross-sectional) that reported on R/SI (exposure) and cognitive function (outcome). RESULTS Of the 6,300 citations obtained in the literature search, 17 met our eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Most of the included studies (82%) reported positive associations between R/SI and cognitive function. R/SI appears to be protective against cognitive decline in middle- and old-age adults.

RECENT FINDINGS There are a very small number of postmortem neuropathological series of coronavirus disease 2019-related cerebrovascular and parenchymal disease. However, they fall into at least three major categories, with the majority manifesting those of terminal hypoxia, and others demonstrating vascular inflammatory leptomeningeal, cerebral and brainstem interstitial changes suspicious for encephalitis in a minority of cases. It remains uncertain whether these histopathological features have a relationship to post-infectious inflammatory immune mechanisms and microscopic vasculitis in adults as it appears to be in affected children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome. SUMMARY The reasons for this dichotomy are unclear but may related to inherent and epigenetic factors that remain poorly understood.

However, measles and mumps' resurgence was recently reported, outbreaks still occur, and challenges remain to control these diseases.Areas covered: This qualitative narrative review provides an objective appraisal of the literature regarding current challenges in controlling measles, mumps, rubella infections, and interventions to address them.Expert opinion: While vaccines against measles, mumps, and rubella (including trivalent vaccines) are widely used and effective, challenges to control these diseases are mainly related to insufficient immunization coverage and changing vaccination needs owing to new global environment (e.g. traveling, migration, population density). By understanding disease transmission peculiarities by setting, initiatives are needed to optimize vaccination policies and increase vaccination coverage, which was further negatively impacted by COVID-19 pandemic. Also, awareness of the potential severity of infections and the role of vaccines should increase. Reminder systems, vaccination of disadvantaged, high-risk and difficult-to-reach populations, accessibility of vaccination, healthcare infrastructure, and vaccination services management should improve. Outbreak preparedness should be strengthened, including implementation of high-quality surveillance systems to monitor epidemiology. While the main focus should be on these public health initiatives to increase vaccination coverage, slightly more benefits could come from evolution of current vaccines.Plain Language SummaryWhat is the context? Measles, mumps, and rubella are highly contagious diseases associated with significant medical and societal burden. Effective vaccines against these diseases are available, and the implementation of vaccination programs drastically reduced disease incidence globally. However, reports of measles and mumps outbreaks in the last few years highlight remaining challenges to eliminate these diseases.What does the review highlight? We conducted a literature review to identify challenges associated with controlling measles, mumps, and rubella infections, and interventions needed to address them. We identified 11 challenges mainly related to low immunization coverage and vaccine characteristics. Societal challenges could be addressed by increasing awareness of disease severity and vaccines impact, targeting high-risk, unvaccinated, and under-vaccinated populations, improving vaccination access, setting up clear outbreak preparedness plans, and implementing country-specific vaccination policies. System weaknesses could be addressed through improving vaccination services and health infrastructure, implementing high-quality surveillance, patient invite, and reminder systems, ensuring vaccine implementation and long-term supply. Interventions related to vaccine characteristic challenges could include adaptation of vaccination schedules (shorter interval between doses, administration of a third dose) and development of vaccines against emerging strains.What is the take-home message?Policymakers should support the following strategies to increase vaccination coverage and reach elimination of measles, mumps, and rubella: strengthening health systems and vaccination access; raising awareness of disease severity and vaccination impact; limiting disease propagation owing to global changing environment and population dynamics (traveling, migration); improving surveillance systems to rapidly address the immunity gaps against disease resurgence.","Kauffmann, Florence; Heffernan, Catherine; Meurice, François; Ota, Martin O C; Vetter, Volker; Casabona, Giacomo",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2021.1927722; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34096442/,571

METHODS This case-control study comprised a subsample of 124 women (35 cases; 89 controls). Endometriosis was confirmed (cases) or ruled out (controls) by laparoscopy, with visual inspection of the pelvis and biopsy of suspected lesions (histological diagnosis). Urinary concentrations of benzophenone-1 (BP-1), benzophenone-3 (BP-3), 4-hydroxibenzophenone (4-OH-BP), methyl- (MeP), ethyl- (EtP), propyl- (PrP), and butyl-paraben (BuP), and biomarkers of oxidative stress [lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and total antioxidant power (TAP)] were quantified. Information was gathered on the frequency of use of cosmetics and PCPs. Associations between the frequency of cosmetics/PCP use, urinary concentrations of benzophenones and parabens, oxidative stress, and endometriosis risk were explored in logistic and linear multivariable regression analyses. RESULTS The frequency of utilization of certain cosmetics and PCPs was significantly associated with urinary concentrations of benzophenones and parabens. After adjustment for potential confounders, the risk of endometriosis was increased in women in the second versus first terciles of MeP (OR=5.63; p-value<0.001), BP-1 (OR=5.12; p-value=0.011), BP-3 (OR=4.98; p-value=0.008), and ƩBPs (OR=3.34; p-value=0.032). A close-to-significant relationship was observed between TBARS concentrations and increased endometriosis risk (OR=1.60, p-value 0.070) and an inverse association between TAP concentrations and this risk (OR=0.15; p-value=0.048). Oxidative stress results did not modify associations observed between benzophenone/paraben exposure and endometriosis risk. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that the frequency of cosmetics and PCP utilization is a strong predictor of exposure to certain benzophenone and paraben congeners. These compounds may increase the risk of endometriosis in an oxidative stress-independent manner. Further studies are warranted to corroborate these findings.","Fm, Peinado; Ocón-Hernández, O; Iribarne-Durán, L M; Vela-Soria, F; A, Ubiña; C, Padilla; Jc, Mora; J, Cardona; J, León; Fernández, M F; N, Olea; Artacho-Cordón, F",Environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069703/,571

METHODS A total of 95 patients with COVID-19 were randomly divided into a moxibustion group (45 cases) and a basic treatment group (50 cases). The routine treatment of western medicine was applied in the patients of both groups. In the moxibustion group, on the base of the treatment of western medicine, moxibustion was applied to Dazhui (GV 14), Feishu (BL 13), Qihai (CV 6) and Zusanli (ST 36), once daily and consecutively for 14 days. At the end of treatment courses, clinical symptom scores for cough, asthmatic breathing, chest oppression and short breath, as well as their remission rates were compared between the two groups before and after treatment. Before and after treatment, the white blood cell (WBC) count, the levels of c-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the absolute number of T lymphocyte subsets, i.e. , and of the peripheral blood were compared in the patients between the two groups. The principal component analysis was adopted to analyze the common data extracted from the above 10 clinical indexes variables and comprehensively evaluate the differences in the therapeutic effect of two regimens. RESULTS The clinical symptom scores were all decreased after treatment in both of the moxibustion group and the basic treatment group as compared with those before treatment (P<0.05). After treatment, the clinical symptom scores of cough, chest oppression and asthmatic breathing in the moxibustion group were lower significantly than those in the basic treatment group (P<0.05) and the remission rates of cough, chest oppression and asthmatic breathing were higher than the basic treatment group (P<0.05). After treatment, WBC count was increased as compared with that before treatment in either group (P<0.05) and the levels of CRP and IL-6 in the moxibustion group were reduced as compared with those before treatment (P<0.05). The reducing range of IL-6 level in the moxibustion group was larger than the basic treatment group (P<0.05). After treatment, the absolute number of , and T lymphocytes was increased as compared with that before treatment in the moxibustion group (P<0.05), and its increase range was larger than the basic treatment group (P<0.05). The difference value was 33.38 for the score of comprehensive evaluation before and after treatment in the moxbustion group, higher obviously than 8.91 in the basic treatment group. CONCLUSION On the base of the routine treatment with western medicine, moxibustion therapy supplemented relieves the clinical symptoms, reduces the levels of inflammatory indexes, i.e. IL-6 and CRP as well as improves the absolute number of peripheral T lymphocyte subsets. The clinical therapeutic effect of such regimen with moxibustion supplemented is significantly better than the simple routine treatment of western medicine.","Liu, Lin; Xing, Xiao-Yan; He, Dong-Chu; Yang, Wen-Chao; Zhang, Meng-Yun; Wu, Wei; Ding, Xiao-Juan; Yu, Qiao; Huang, He-Song; Sun, Xiao-Bo; Zhang, Yong; Yang, Jin-Sheng",Zhongguo zhen jiu = Chinese acupuncture & moxibustion,https://doi.org/10.13703/j.0255-2930.20200507-k0003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33415866/,571

Various microfluidic-based approaches for digital NAA have been developed, but most methods require complex auxiliary control instruments, cumbersome device fabrication, or inconvenient preparation processes. A SlipChip is a microfluidic device that can generate and manipulate liquid partitions through simple movements of two microfluidic plates in close contact. However, the traditional SlipChip requires accurate alignment of microfeatures on different plates; therefore, the dimensions of the microwells and density of partitions can be constrained. Here, we developed a droplet array SlipChip (da-SlipChip) that can form droplets of various sizes at high density in a single slipping step. This process does not require precise overlapping microfeatures on different plates; therefore, the design flexibility and partition density can be significantly increased. We quantified SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids extracted from the COVID-19 pseudovirus by digital loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) on a da-SlipChip with 21 696 of 0.25 nL droplets, and the results were in good agreement with those of the commercial digital PCR method of Stilla. Furthermore, we demonstrated a random-access system with a single-throughput fluorescence imager and a stackable thermal control instrument with nine independent heating modules.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety between contact aspiration (CA) first-line thrombectomy and stent retriever (SR) first-line thrombectomy in CRS patients. METHODS Sixty-two CRS patients with ELVO, who underwent MT between January 2013 and October 2019 at our institution, were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups based on the first-line MT method and compared: the CA group (n=28), which included those who received CA alone or combined CA with SR, and the SR group (n=34), which included those who received conventional SR alone. RESULTS Overall, reperfusion was successful in 75.8% (47/62) of CRS patients, and a good clinical outcome at 90 days was observed in 17.7%. The CA group showed a higher rate of successful reperfusion (89.3% vs 64.7%, P=0.025) shorter procedure time (22 vs 42 min; P=0.029), higher rate of first pass effect (35.7% vs 11.8%, P=0.025), and lower number of passes (1 vs 3, P=0.023) when compared with the SR group. The procedural and hemorrhagic complication rates were similar between the CA and SR groups. The first-line contact aspiration (OR 11.624, 95% CI 1.041 to 129.752; P=0.046) was an independent predictor of successful reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with CRS, CA - whether alone or in combination with SR - as first-line MT seems to provide more rapid and successful reperfusion when compared with SR.","Jeon, Yejin; Baik, Sung Hyun; Jung, Cheolkyu; Kim, Jun Yup; Kim, Beom Joon; Kang, Jihoon; Bae, Hee-Joon; Kim, Jae Hyoung",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2020-016144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32586910/,571
122487,Factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Indonesia: an adoption of Technology Acceptance Model.,2021,"BACKGROUND Fat tissue transfer is commonly used for different soft-tissue defects in surgery. The immediate result of these operations is often good, but the long-term result is unfortunately unpredictable. The authors used an experimental model to evaluate the vascularization, survival, and metabolic changes after free fat transfer and the impact of proangiogenic therapy on these processes. METHODS Fat was collected from the mouse epididymal region and placed into the subcutaneous tissue of the forehead. Fat grafts were treated with proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A (n = 9) or the control vector (n = 9). Metabolic activity and fat graft volume were investigated by positron emission tomography-computed tomography at 4 weeks and at 12 weeks. Histologic analysis was performed at 12 weeks. RESULTS The glucose metabolism (fluorodeoxyglucose uptake) of the transferred epididymal fat was higher than in the epididymal fat before transplantation in both study groups (VEGF-A and control) and resembled that of normal subcutaneous fat. VEGF-A therapy enhanced the survival and capillary density of the transferred fat after surgery. CONCLUSIONS Transfer of the metabolically inactive (epididymal) fat into a new environment modulated the metabolic activity of the fat grafts to resemble the situation in the recipient site. These novel findings support the clinical use of free fat grafts in various anatomical regions and tissue types. Proangiogenic VEGF-A therapy enhanced the vascularization and survival of the free fat grafts.","Tervala, Tomi V; Grönroos, Tove J; Hartiala, Pauliina; Nuutila, Pirjo; Suominen, Erkki A; Karra, Henna; Kivinen, Katri; Ylä-Herttuala, Seppo; Saarikko, Anne M",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/01.prs.0000436839.62128.3b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24150116/,571
123564,"Much to Change, Much to Learn.",2020,"BACKGROUND Anemia is common in premature infants. Due to risks with red blood cell transfusions, many anemic infants are not transfused. The implications of this pathophysiologic status, especially at times of increased metabolic demand (enteral feedings), is not well understood. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) allows for the noninvasive determination of regional oxygen saturations (rSO2) in tissues such as the brain and mesentery, giving insight into their oxygen sufficiency. OBJECTIVE We tested the hypothesis that during enteral feedings very low birth weight (VLBW) infants with a hematocrit ≤28% will experience a decrease in splanchnic rSO2 and splanchnic-cerebral oxygenation ratio (SCOR). METHODS This prospective, observational, 2-centered study included VLBW infants receiving full enteral feedings with a hematocrit ≤28%. Cerebral and splanchnic rSO2 were monitored via NIRS for 24 h. Average values were calculated for periods immediately preceding, during, and after each feeding. SCOR was calculated from these values (rSO2 splanchnic/rSO2 cerebral), and data were analyzed using a linear mixed effect model. RESULTS Fifty neonates with a median gestational age of 28 weeks (range 23-32), a birth weight of 1,118 ± 284 g (mean ± SD), and a hematocrit of 26 ± 2% (mean ± SD) were studied. During feedings, SCOR decreased significantly from baseline (0.72 ± 0.17 to 0.69 ± 0.17, p = 0.043). With feedings, there was a trend of decreased splanchnic rSO2 (47 ± 11 to 45 ± 10, p = 0.057) and no change in cerebral rSO2 (66 ± 8 to 66 ± 7, p = 0.597). CONCLUSIONS VLBW infants with a hematocrit ≤28% had a decrease in SCOR and a trend towards decreased splanchnic rSO2 with enteral feedings.","Braski, Katherine; Weaver-Lewis, Kimberlee; Loertscher, Manndi; Ding, Qian; Sheng, Xiaoming; Baserga, Mariana",Neonatology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000481396; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29131125/,571

DATA SOURCES PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL, ERIC, Cab Abstracts and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials are the electronic databases searched in this systematic review. STUDY SELECTION Each included study evaluated an intervention to reduce SSB consumption in children aged 0 to 5 years, was conducted in a high-income country and was published between 1 January 2000 and 15 December 2017. DATA SYNTHESIS Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. The primary intervention settings were healthcare (n = 11), preschool/daycare (n = 4), home (n = 3), community venues (n = 3) and other settings (n = 6). Overarching strategies which successfully reduced SSB consumption included (i) in-person individual education, (ii) in-person group education, (iii) passive education (e.g. pamphlets), (iv) use of technology, (v) training for childcare/healthcare providers and (vi) changes to the physical access of beverages. Studies were of moderate methodological quality (average score of 20.7/29.0 for randomized studies; 3.1/9.0 for non-randomized studies). CONCLUSIONS Evidence suggests that interventions successful at reducing SSB consumption among 0-year to 5-year olds often focused on vulnerable populations, were conducted in preschool/daycare settings, specifically targeted only SSBs or only oral hygiene, included multiple intervention strategies and had higher intervention intensity/contact time.","Vercammen, K A; Frelier, J M; Lowery, C M; McGlone, M E; Ebbeling, C B; Bleich, S N",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.12741; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30019442/,571

METHODS Forty pigs (30 kg) were intubated and challenged via bronchoscopy with a suspension of 106 colony forming units of MRSA into every lobe. Afterwards, pigs were ventilated up to 96 hours. Twelve hours after bacterial inoculation, the animals were randomized into 4 groups of treatment: group 1, control; group 2, vancomycin twice daily; group 3, continuous infusion of vancomycin; and group 4, linezolid. Clinical and laboratory parameters were monitored throughout the study. Bacterial cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue samples were performed at the end of the study. Measurements of histopathology derangements of lung samples and studies of intrapulmonary drug penetration were performed. RESULTS A total of 34 animals completed the study. No differences in clinical and laboratory parameters were observed. The percentage of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue samples with positive cultures for MRSA in controls and groups 2, 3, and 4 was respectively 75%, 11%, 11%, and 0% (p < .01); 52%, 9%, 24%, and 2.5% (p < .01). Histopathology studies demonstrated signs of pneumonia in 95%, 69%, 58%, and 57% and signs of severe pneumonia in 48%, 29%, 22%, and 0% of controls and groups 2, 3, and 4, respectively (p < .01). In addition, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics profile in serum and lung tissue showed better results for linezolid compared with both vancomycin treatments. CONCLUSIONS In this animal model of MRSA pneumonia, linezolid showed a better efficacy than vancomycin showed because of a better pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics index.","Martinez-Olondris, Pilar; Rigol, Montserrat; Soy, Dolors; Guerrero, Laura; Agusti, Carlos; Quera, Maria Angels; Li Bassi, Gianluigi; Esperatti, Mariano; Luque, Nestor; Liapikou, Manto; Filella, Xavier; Marco, Francesc; de la Bellacasa, Jordi Puig; Torres, Antoni",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0b013e31822d74a2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21926613/,571
124480,Current Perspectives of convalescent plasma therapy in COVID-19.,2020-11-10,"The technique for split-thickness skin graft harvest varies among surgeons. Even though there is scientific evidence that the subcutaneous injection of modified tumescent solution reduces blood loss during burn surgery, the technique has not been unanimously adapted because of, in part, fear of healing retardation. This study prospectively examines the effect of tumescent injection on donor site perfusion, healing, and pain. Ten burn patients in need of grafting with a need for two distinctly different donor sites were included. During the grafting procedure, the two donor areas were randomly assigned to receive either modified tumescent solution or warm sterile saline solution subcutaneously before skin graft harvest with a dermatome. Perfusion, pain, pruritus, and donor site healing were measured, and a follow-up evaluation on scar quality was performed. Baseline perfusion on day 1 was significantly less in the donor site injected with modified tumescent solution (62.26 vs 95.71 perfusion units; P = .031), whereas the response to heat was similar in both sites. The physiologic response to injury (hyperemia) on days 2 and 3 was not suppressed in the modified tumescent group. Pain reported on day 1 was 2.38/10 in the tumescent site and 3.38/10 in the saline site (P = .21). On all other days, measurements showed no difference between the two sites. Donor sites healed in an average of 16.1 days with modified tumescent solution and in 16.4 days with saline. Late follow-up showed no difference in scar quality. The subcutaneous injection of modified tumescent solution before split-thickness donor site harvest has no adverse effect on donor site perfusion past day 1 or donor site healing. The addition of a local anesthetic may decrease pain for 24 hours postoperatively, but the difference in this study group was not significant. This technique should be universally recommended.","Blome-Eberwein, Sigrid; Abboud, Michael; Lozano, Daniel D; Sharma, Rohit; Eid, Sherrine; Gogal, Christina",Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association,https://doi.org/10.1097/bcr.0b013e31825d5414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23237817/,571

However, it is affected by many factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of SVV on Trendelenburg (T) and reverse Trendelenburg (RT) position and to further elaborate on the patterns of the SVV with position. METHODS Forty-two patients undergoing elective surgery were enrolled in this study. Fifteen minutes after standardized induction of anesthesia with propofol, fentanyl, and rocuronium with volume controlled ventilation (tidal volume of 8 ml/kg of ideal body weight, inspiration : expiration ratio of 1 : 2, and respiratory rate of 10-13 breaths/min), the patients underwent posture changes as follows: supine, T position at slopes of operating table of -5°, -10°, and -15°, and RT position at slopes of operating table of 5°, 10°, and 15°. At each point, SVV, cardiac output (CO), peak airway pressure (PAP), mean blood pressure, and heart rate (HR) were recorded. RESULTS The SVV was significant decreased with decreased slopes of operating table in T position, and increased with increased slopes of operating table in RT position (P = 0.000). Schematically, it was increased by 1% when the slope of operating table was increased by 5°. But, the CO and PAP were significant increased with decreased slopes of operating table in T position, and decreased with increased slopes of operating table in RT position (P = 0.045, 0.027). CONCLUSIONS SVV is subjected to the posture, and we should take these findings into account on reading SVV for fluid therapy.","Min, Jin Hye; Lee, Sang Eun; Lee, Hong Sik; Chae, Young Keun; Lee, Yong Kyung; Kang, Yoo; Je, Ui Jin",Korean journal of anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.4097/kjae.2014.67.6.378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25558337/,571

RECENT FINDINGS Polymyositis originally referred to inflammatory muscle diseases presenting with muscle weakness and inflammatory cell infiltrates on muscle tissue visible by microscopy. Over time and with improved technology to immunophenotype infiltrating inflammatory cells and characterize muscle fibres, the meaning of polymyositis changed and became more specific. There is ongoing controversy over the term polymyositis, with proponents for a strict definition based on histopathological and immunohistochemical features on muscle biopsies whereas others advocate for a broader clinical and histopathological phenotype. Over the past decades, the discovery of several myositis-specific autoantibodies together with distinct histopathological features have enabled the identification of new subsets previously labelled as polymyositis notably the antisynthetase syndrome and the immune-mediated necrotizing myopathies thus reducing the number of patients classified as polymyositis. SUMMARY There are still a small number of patients among the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies that can be classified as polymyositis as discussed in this review but the entity is now considered relatively rare.","Leclair, Valérie; Notarnicola, Antonella; Vencovsky, Jiri; Lundberg, Ingrid E",Current opinion in rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1097/bor.0000000000000837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34494607/,571

The aim of this study is to evaluate the complication rates of the gastric stapling alone versus stapling with oversewing invagination of the staple line in the LSG. METHODS This is a single-center randomized study, Patients were randomized to two groups, 200 patients underwent LSG without reinforcement of the staple line and 200 patients underwent LSG with oversewing of the staple line. All patients were followed up for 1 year. The data collected prospectively for statistical analysis included demographics, BMI, preoperative comorbidities, operative time, complications, and hospital stay. RESULTS The overall mean operative age was 33.7 ± 9.4 years and mean BMI was 42.4 ± 4.3 kg/m2. Patient baseline characteristics (age, gender, weight, and BMI) and comorbidities were generally a nonsignificant different between the treatment arms. Surgical time was shorter in patients of the nonreinforced group (44.3 ± vs 51.3 ± 4.3 min; p < 0.01) with lower %EWL (73 ± 13.8 vs 80.7 ± 13.6%, p < 0.01). One patient in the nonreinforced group was complicated by gastric leak. The staple-line bleeding rate was significantly lower in patients underwent oversewing of the staple line during LSG (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Oversewing of the staple line during LSG is a nonexpansive and easy method to decrease the incidence and severity of the postoperative bleeding. However, it is time-consuming and should be performed by experienced surgeons to avoid the complications which may occur secondary to the seroserotomy suturing.","Taha, Osama; Abdelaal, Mahmoud; Talaat, Mohamed; Abozeid, Mohamed",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-017-2835-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28741238/,571

Neuroimaging characteristics may correlate with thrombus composition. In this study we aimed to investigate the relationship between the hyperdense artery sign (HAS) on imaging and thrombus composition. MATERIALS AND METHODS Acute ischemic stroke patients who underwent endovascular thrombus retrieval from 2010-2012 were prospectively recruited. One blinded pathologist prepared the histology sections of retrieved thrombi whereby staining with haematoxylin and eosin and CD34 immunostain were performed. Histology sections were categorised into 4 phases of thrombus formation: red blood cell (RBC) dominant, RBC proportion equal to fibrin, fibrin dominant and organised fibrin. Computed tomography (CT) brain scans were assessed for HAS. Fisher's exact test was performed to identify an association between HAS and thrombus composition. RESULTS Forty patients were included. The mean age was 65.6±12.9 years and 67.5% were male. Atrial fibrillation was detected in 19 (47.5%) patients, diabetes mellitus in 6 (15.0%), hypercholesterolaemia in 11 (27.5%), hypertension in 20 (50.0%) and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack in 8 (20.0%) patients. Of the retrieved thrombi, 11 (27.5%) were RBC dominant, 11 (27.5%) RBC proportion was equal to fibrin, 7 (17.5%) fibrin dominant and 11 (27.5%) organised fibrin pathology. HAS was present in 29 (72.5%) patients and was significantly associated with thrombus early phase pathology (P<0.05). CONCLUSION HAS was significantly associated with early phase thrombus composition. This may enable the prediction of thrombus composition and allow for targeted selection of therapeutic modality.","Simons, Natasha; Mitchell, Peter; Dowling, Richard; Gonzales, Michael; Yan, Bernard",Journal of neuroradiology.

The present study reports on a novel electrode structure design together with its experimental assessment for RF thermo-fusion of porcine colonic segments. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two types of electrode were constructed and used in the present study: one with a conventional smooth surface (S) and the other with a novel reciprocating concave-convex (CC) configuration. Finite element modeling was used to study the thermal distribution profile of the CC electrode. Ex vivo porcine colonic segments were used to create end-to-end serosa-to-serosa colonic anastomoses by applying a pulse of 160 W RF power for 20 s. Different compression pressures (S1, S2, S3) and (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5), were applied, via specially designed ring carriers, to the S and CC electrodes, respectively. Assessment was based on anastomotic burst pressures and histological appearances using light microscopy of paraffin sections. RESULTS In total, 22 RF-induced circular anastomoses were performed. Similar burst pressures were observed for anastomoses created by the two types of electrodes (S, CC) performed under the same compression pressure. In contrast, significant differences were observed on histological examination of tissue anastomotic site. In particular, fusion areas between gaps of the CC electrode showed normal histological appearance, while the S electrode produced a completely flat featureless appearance. Furthermore, the CC electrode produced significantly different burst pressures depending on the applied compression pressure during thermo-fusion: compression pressures C1 vs. C4 produced circular anastomotic fusions with burst pressures of 21.9 ± 9.3 vs. 44.6 ± 8.9 mmHg, (p = 0.034); but the burst pressure beyond C4, declined significantly, with C4 vs. C5, burst pressures of 44.6 ± 8.9 vs. 24.7 ± 8.0 mmHg, (p = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS The CC electrode exhibits larger and faster thermal diffusion profiles resulting in normal histological appearances in the gaps between CC electrode by protecting tissue from mechanical and thermal damage.","Zhao, Lingxi; Song, Chengli; Wang, Zhigang; Zhou, Yu; Li, Xinxiang; Zhu, Wei; Cuschieri, Alfred",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3864-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25303908/,571

We sought to identify the risk factors for post-LDP complications. We examined 1227 patients who underwent LDP between March 2005 and December 2015 at a single large-volume center. We used logistic regression for the analysis. The overall (13.2%) and major (3.3%) complication rates were determined. Postoperative pancreatic fistula was the most frequent complication, and 58 patients (4.7%) had clinically significant (grade B) pancreatic fistulas. No 90-day mortality was recorded. Long operative time (≥200 min), large estimated blood loss (≥320 mL), LDP performed by an inexperienced surgeon (<50 cases), and concomitant splenectomy were identified as risk factors for overall complications using a logistic regression model. For major complications, male sex (p = 0.020), long operative time (p = 0.005), and LDP performed by an inexperienced surgeon (p = 0.026) were significant predictive factors. Using logistic regression analysis, surgery-related factors, including long operative time and LDP performed by an inexperienced surgeon, were correlated with overall and major complications of LDP. As LDP is a technically challenging procedure, surgery-related variables emerged as the main risk factors for postoperative complications. Appropriate patient selection and sufficient surgeon experience may be essential to reduce the complications of LDP.","Song, Ki Byung; Hong, Sarang; Kim, Hwa Jung; Park, Yejong; Kwon, Jaewoo; Lee, Woohyung; Jun, Eunsung; Lee, Jae Hoon; Hwang, Dae Wook; Kim, Song Cheol",Journal of clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9092766; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32858997/,571
131402,Covid-19 in the workplace.,2020-09-21,"Background In recent years, more than 120 million people each year have needed urgent humanitarian assistance and protection. Armed conflict has profoundly negative consequences in communities. Destruction of civilian infrastructure impacts access to basic health services and complicates widespread emergency responses. The number of conflicts occurring is increasing, lasting longer and affecting more people today than a decade ago. The number of children living in conflict zones has been steadily increasing since the year 2000, increasing the need for health services and resources. This review systematically synthesised the indexed and grey literature reporting on the delivery of trauma and rehabilitation interventions for conflict-affected populations. Methods A systematic search of literature published from 1 January 1990 to 31 March 2018 was conducted across several databases. Eligible publications reported on women and children in low and middle-income countries. Included publications provided information on the delivery of interventions for trauma, sustained injuries or rehabilitation in conflict-affected populations. Results A total of 81 publications met the inclusion criteria, and were included in our review. Nearly all of the included publications were observational in nature, employing retrospective chart reviews of surgical procedures delivered in a hospital setting to conflict-affected individuals. The majority of publications reported injuries due to explosive devices and remnants of war. Injuries requiring orthopaedic/reconstructive surgeries were the most commonly reported interventions. Barriers to health services centred on the distance and availability from the site of injury to health facilities. Conclusions Traumatic injuries require an array of medical and surgical interventions, and their effective treatment largely depends on prompt and timely management and referral, with appropriate rehabilitation services and post-treatment follow-up. Further work to evaluate intervention delivery in this domain is needed, particularly among children given their specialised needs, and in different population displacement contexts.

131592,"[COVID-19, state of medical knowledge].",2020,"Qualitative risk assessment methods are often used as the first step to determining design space boundaries; however, quantitative assessments of risk with respect to the design space, i.e., calculating the probability of failure for a given severity, are needed to fully characterize design space boundaries. Quantitative risk assessment methods in design and operational spaces are a significant aid to evaluating proposed design space boundaries. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate a relatively simple strategy for design space definition using a simplified Bayesian Monte Carlo simulation. This paper builds on a previous paper that used failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) qualitative risk assessment and Plackett-Burman design of experiments to identity the critical quality attributes. The results show that the sequential use of qualitative and quantitative risk assessments can focus the design of experiments on a reduced set of critical material and process parameters that determine a robust design space under conditions of limited laboratory experimentation. This approach provides a strategy by which the degree of risk associated with each known parameter can be calculated and allocates resources in a manner that manages risk to an acceptable level.","Claycamp, H Gregg; Kona, Ravikanth; Fahmy, Raafat; Hoag, Stephen W",AAPS PharmSciTech,https://doi.org/10.1208/s12249-015-0349-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26202064/,571

Mamu-A*01 negative rhesus macaques were immunized in groups of four with either: RV expressing SIV(mac239)-GagPol, a combination of RV expressing SIV(mac239)-Env and RV expressing SIV(mac239)-GagPol, or with empty RV vectors. Eight weeks later animals received a booster immunization with a heterologous RV expressing the same antigens. At 12 weeks post-boost, all animals were challenged intravenously with 100 TCID(50) of pathogenic SIV(mac251-CX). Immunized macaques in both vaccine groups had 1.3-1.6-log-fold decrease in viral set point compared to control animals. The GagPol/Env immunized animals also had a significantly lower peak viral load. When compared to control animals following challenge, vaccinated macaques had a more rapid induction of SIV(mac251) neutralizing antibodies and of CD8(+) T cell responses to various SIV epitopes. Moreover, vaccinated macaques better maintained peripheral memory CD4(+) T cells and were able to mount a poly-functional CD8(+) T cell response in the mucosa. These findings indicate promise for RV-based vectors and have important implications for the development of an efficacious HIV vaccine.","Faul, Elizabeth J; Aye, Pyone P; Papaneri, Amy B; Pahar, Bapi; McGettigan, James P; Schiro, Faith; Chervoneva, Inna; Montefiori, David C; Lackner, Andrew A; Schnell, Matthias J",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.10.051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19879223/,571

We suggest that the most important determinant should be the resulting scar. This study aims to compare both patients' and independent observers' assessment of mature laparotomy scars that had been closed with either subcuticular sutures or external staples. METHODS Consecutive patients were enrolled at least 1 year following colorectal surgery. Scars were assessed with the validated Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scoring (POSAS) tool. Photographs were assessed by a blinded independent panel. RESULTS Overall, 232 patients were enrolled (90 suture, 143 staples). The two groups were well matched by factors affecting wound healing. Patients' overall opinion of their scar was significantly better for the Suture group than the Staples group (P = 0.028) despite there being no difference in their self-assessment of the components of their scar score (pain, itch, colour, stiffness, thickness, irregularity). The panel recorded similar overall scores for the Suture and Staples groups (P = 0.059). There was a significant lower (better) score recorded for the scar area component for the Suture group than the Staples group (P = 0.008) but no differences for the other components (vascularity, pigmentation or thickness). DISCUSSION This study has shown that independent of skin closure method, patients who have undergone major abdominal surgery have a positive opinion of their mature scars. The patients' overall impression of the wound favours a sutured closure due to a smaller scar area (no staple marks). In all other respects, skin closure with staples would appear acceptable.","Simcock, Jeremy W; Armitage, Jon; Dixon, Liane; MacFarlane, Kim; Robertson, Greg M; Frizelle, Frank A",ANZ journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.12257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23809005/,571

A systematic review.,2020-11-06,"Psychoanalytic training has been an object of controversy for many years. Arguments have been intense about the details, sometimes called ""requirements"", and particularly over whether or not training institutes should have routine external validation. We describe these arguments and present preliminary conclusions about the core challenges psychoanalytic trainings face using a unique set of detailed observations collected during structured ""conversations"" inside nine European institutes. We conclude that whether a psychoanalytic training is ""working"" is not a matter of compliance with requirements. Rather, it is an issue of how candidates, training analysts, supervisors and committee members, confront within and between each other the consequences of the unconscious dynamics that psychoanalytic training must inevitably create. Institutional psychoanalytic capacity is to take itself as the object. Consequentially, we propose that training committees that seek to claim that their psychoanalytic training is genuinely and safely producing psychoanalysts would be ones that institute routine procedures to show to themselves, transparently, how they attend to the dynamics just mentioned and how they take a neutral inquisitive stance towards them. Fear of oversight, we suggest, is a symptom of deeper anxieties. They can be faced by creating an appropriate setting.

133297,"Covid-19: Delaying end of lockdown will allow more people to be vaccinated, UK government announces.",2021-06-16,"BACKGROUND Africa is undergoing both an environmental and an epidemiological transition. Household air pollution is the predominant form of air pollution, but it is declining, whereas ambient air pollution is increasing. We aimed to quantify how air pollution is affecting health, human capital, and the economy across Africa, with a particular focus on Ethiopia, Ghana, and Rwanda. METHODS Data on household and ambient air pollution were from WHO Global Health Observatory, and data on morbidity and mortality were from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease Study. We estimated economic output lost due to air pollution-related disease by country, with use of labour income per worker, adjusted by the probability that a person (of a given age) was working. Losses were expressed in 2019 international dollars and as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP). We also quantified the contribution of particulate matter (PM)2·5 pollution to intelligence quotient (IQ) loss in children younger than 10 years, with use of an exposure-response coefficient based on previously published data. FINDINGS Air pollution was responsible for 1·1 million deaths across Africa in 2019. Household air pollution accounted for 697 000 deaths and ambient air pollution for 394 000. Ambient air pollution-related deaths increased from 361 000 in 2015, to 383 000 in 2019, with the greatest increases in the most highly developed countries. The majority of deaths due to ambient air pollution are caused by non-communicable diseases. The loss in economic output in 2019 due to air pollution-related morbidity and mortality was $3·02 billion in Ethiopia (1·16% of GDP), $1·63 billion in Ghana (0·95% of GDP), and $349 million in Rwanda (1·19% of GDP). PM2·5 pollution was estimated to be responsible for 1·96 billion lost IQ points in African children in 2019. INTERPRETATION Ambient air pollution is increasing across Africa. In the absence of deliberate intervention, it will increase morbidity and mortality, diminish economic productivity, impair human capital formation, and undercut development. Because most African countries are still early in development, they have opportunities to transition rapidly to wind and solar energy, avoiding a reliance on fossil fuel-based economies and minimising pollution.

METHODS A retrospective review of the prospective endovascular database was performed to identify cases in which a coaxial system with a compliant balloon catheter (Scepter C, MicroVention/Terumo; or TransForm C, Stryker Neurovascular) and a large-bore reperfusion catheter of the Penumbra system (Penumbra, Inc.) was used. The authors achieved a stable guiding sheath position and delivered the coaxial system with a compliant balloon catheter and a large-bore reperfusion catheter. Then, the balloon was inflated somewhat when the distal tip of the balloon was slightly advanced from the tip of the reperfusion catheter, and together the coaxial system was advanced to an embolus over a 0.014-in guidewire, even around the corner. When the distal tip of the balloon catheter reached the embolus, the authors deflated the balloon and navigated the large-bore reperfusion catheter to the embolus. Finally, the aspiration of the embolus with the Penumbra MAX pump was begun. RESULTS Between May 2014 and September 2015, the authors used this technique in 17 cases: 16 cases of middle cerebral artery occlusion (including 5 cases of internal carotid artery occlusion) and 1 case of basilar artery occlusion (age range 36-88 years, mean age 74.7 years, 13 men). For the reperfusion catheter of the Penumbra system, the 5MAX ACE was used in 15 cases, and the 5MAX was used in 2 cases. As a compliant balloon catheter, the Scepter C was used in 16 cases, and the TransForm C was used in 1 case. The technique was successful in 16 cases (94.1%). No parent artery dissections were noted in any cases. Catheter-induced vasospasm was noted in 1 case, but the vasospasm was transient. CONCLUSIONS A coaxial system with a compliant balloon catheter can help safely and easily to navigate the large-bore reperfusion catheter of the Penumbra system to an embolus in patients with tortuous arteries.","Takahira, Kazuki; Kataoka, Taketo; Ogino, Tatsuya; Endo, Hideki; Nakamura, Hirohiko",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2016.3.jns152790; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27257836/,571

Retrospective at the time of COVID-19].,2020-06-19,"Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) is a key adaptor protein that regulates the NF-κB pathway, in which MALT1 functions as a scaffold protein and protease to trigger downstream signals. The abnormal expression of MALT1 is closely associated with lymphomagenesis and other diseases, including solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. MALT1 is the only protease in the underlying pathogenesis of these diseases, and its proteolytic activity can be pharmacologically regulated. Therefore, MALT1 is a potential and promising target for anti-lymphoma and other MALT1-related disease treatments. Currently, the development of MALT1 inhibitors is still in its early stages. This review presents an overview of MALT1, particularly its X-ray structures and biological functions, and elaborates on the pathogenesis of diseases associated with its dysregulation. We then summarize previously reported MALT1 inhibitors, focusing on their molecular structure, biological activity, structure-activity relationship, and limitations. Finally, we propose future research directions to accelerate the discovery of novel MALT1 inhibitors with clinical applications. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of MALT1-related research advances and serves as a theoretical basis for drug discovery and research.","Liang, Xuewu; Cao, YiChun; Li, Chunpu; Yu, Haolan; Yang, Chenghua; Liu, Hong",Medicinal research reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/med.21799; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763890/,571

The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the quality of life and the cost-effectiveness of a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with respect to an open distal pancreatectomy. METHODS Forty-one patients who underwent a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and 40 patients who underwent an open distal pancreatectomy were retrospectively studied as regards postoperative results, quality of life and cost-effectiveness analysis. The Italian neutral version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire C-30, version 3.0, was used to rate the quality of life. RESULTS Postoperative results were similar in the two groups; the only difference was that the first oral intake took place significantly earlier in the laparoscopic group than in the open group (P < 0.001). Regarding quality of life, the laparoscopic approach was able to ameliorate physical functioning (P = 0.049), role functioning (P = 0.044) and cognitive functioning (P = 0.030) and reduce the sleep disturbance scale (P = 0.050). The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the acceptability curve for a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy had a higher probability of being more cost-effective than an open distal pancreatectomy when a willingness to pay above 5400 Euros/quality-adjusted life years (QALY) was accepted. CONCLUSION Despite the limitations of the study, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy can be considered not only safe and feasible but also permits a better quality of life and is acceptable in terms of cost-effectiveness to Italian and European health care services.","Ricci, Claudio; Casadei, Riccardo; Taffurelli, Giovanni; Bogoni, Selene; D'Ambra, Marielda; Ingaldi, Carlo; Pagano, Nico; Pacilio, Carlo Alberto; Minni, Francesco",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-015-2841-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26001367/,571

METHODS This study adopted a retrospective data analysis. We investigated ACP services provided by 15 veterans hospitals in Taiwan from 2019 to June 2020. We also conducted a statistical analysis on the ACP services provided by the Taipei Veterans General Hospital. RESULTS From 2019 to June 2020, 15 veterans hospitals in Taiwan provided ACP services to 2,493 individuals. The outpatient ACP services declined significantly after January 2020, decreasing from a national average of 206.2 ± 29.2 declarants per month to 106.2 ± 30.8 declarants per month in the 6 months immediately following the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak (p < 0.001). From the official implementation of the ACP in January 2019 to the end of June 2020, a total of 1,126 declarants accepted ACP services at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital. When the COVID-19 pandemic was prevalent, the declarants who received ACP services were younger (i.e., 60.1 ± 15.2 vs. 65.5 ± 16.3 years; p <0.001). After the variables had been adjusted, the changes in the characteristics of the declarants receiving ACP services when the COVID-19 pandemic was prevalent were as follows: a significant increase in the percentage of hospital staff receiving ACP services (OR: 5.460, 95% CI: 2.378-12.536); An increase in the percentage of declarants who paid for the ACP services received at their own expense (OR: 3.417, 95% CI: 1.591-7.339); and an increase in the percentage of declarants who received the consultations with 3 or more people (OR: 2.017, 95% CI: 1.278-3.182).

Potassium disorder is a common electrolyte abnormality and it increases the risk of death from any cause, particularly cardiovascular events. Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte abnormality encountered post organ transplantation. The etiology is multifactorial, and includes drugs such as calcineurin inhibitors. In certain regards, the clinical picture of post-transplantation hyperkalemia and hypertension resembles that of Gordon syndrome or familial hyperkalemic hypertension, a disorder characterized by over activity of thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter. Effective and safe management of chronic hyperkalemia can be challenging in this special patient population. Despite the significant short-term and long-term side effects, fludrocortisone (a potent synthetic oral mineralocorticoid receptor agonist) has emerged as the default drug of choice for treatment of refractory hyperkalemia in many organ transplant recipients. However, the long-term efficacy and safety of fludrocortisone for management of hyperkalemia in organ transplant recipients remains unknown. This review discusses potassium homeostasis, including the role of the kidneys, and focuses on calcineurin inhibitor-induced hyperkalemia and on the under-appreciated role of thiazide-type diuretic use in management of hyperkalemia and hypertension.

A survey of American Level 1 trauma centers was performed to elucidate the extent to which these products are currently employed. METHODS A survey was written that probed into the current use of blood products in trauma resuscitation with specific emphasis on LTOWB and group A plasma. A list of adult civilian Level 1 trauma centers in the continental USA was obtained from two public surgery and trauma focused websites. An email was then sent to each center's transfusion service medical director or laboratory manager providing them with a link to the online survey. RESULTS Responses were received from 103/187 (55%) adult civilian Level 1 trauma centers. For the resuscitation of trauma patients, group A plasma was used at 94/103 (91%) centers, while LTOWB was used at 43/103 (42%) centers. There were 39/103 (38%) centers that used both products. At 62/94 (66%) of the centers that used group A plasma, there was no limit on the number of units that could be administered, while an unlimited number of LTOWB units could be used at 5/43 (12%) of the centers that used LTOWB. RhD-positive LTOWB could be transfused to RhD-negative or RhD-type unknown females of childbearing potential at 22/43 (51%) of centers. CONCLUSION The use of group A plasma and LTOWB in trauma is increasing at American Level 1 trauma centers.","Yazer, Mark H; Spinella, Philip C; Anto, Vincent; M Dunbar, Nancy",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16394; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33797100/,571

There are formal criteria to solidify the diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), but patients are encountered who have clinical and electrodiagnostic features of CIDP but do not fulfill diagnostic criteria. These patients are addressed in recent publications. CIDP (and variants) and other forms of immune-mediated neuropathies (multifocal motor neuropathy) are responsive early on to treatment, but long-term factors are less well described, and a number of publications focus on extended consequences. Acute immune neuropathies have been described in the setting of viral illness, and recent publications look at the question as to whether they are associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, idiopathic sensory neuropathies are the most common polyneuropathy, and consensus efforts to codify features into subtypes can be used clinically for a more precise diagnosis.","Bromberg, Mark B",Journal of clinical neuromuscular disease,https://doi.org/10.1097/cnd.0000000000000371; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34019004/,571

In this study, a sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry method was used to identify the compounds and metabolites in various biosamples, including plasma, bile, liver, lung, kidney, urine, and faeces, following the intravenous administration of Tanreqing injection in rats. A total of 89 compounds were characterized in the biosamples of Tanreqing injection-treated rats, including 25 precursor constituents and 64 metabolites. Nine flavonoid compounds, 12 phenolic acids and 4 iridoid glycosides were identified in the rats. Their metabolites were mainly produced by glucuronidation, deglucuronidation, glycosylation, deglycosylation, methylation, demethylation, N-heterocyclisation, sulphation, dehydroxylation, decarboxylation, dehydration, hydroxylation, and corresponding recombination reactions. This study was the first to comprehensively investigate the metabolic profile of Tanreqing injection and provides a scientific basis to further elucidate the pharmacodynamic material basis and therapeutic mechanism of Tanreqing injection.

141589,Correction.,2021-03-24,"BACKGROUND The enzyme-biomarker prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is an active target for imaging and therapeutic applications for prostate cancer. The internalization of PSMA has been shown to vary with inhibitors' mode of binding: irreversible, slowly reversible, and reversible. METHODS In the present study, PSMA-targeted clickable derivatives of an irreversible phosphoramidate inhibitor DBCO-PEG(4) -CTT-54 (IC(50) = 1.0 nM) and a slowly reversible phosphate inhibitor, DBCO-PEG(4) -CTT-54.2 (IC(50) = 6.6 nM) were clicked to (99m) Tc(CO)(3) -DPA-azide to assemble a PSMA-targeted SPECT agent. The selectivity, percent uptake, and internalization of these PSMA-targeted SPECT agents were evaluated in PSMA-positive and PSMA-negative cells. RESULTS In vitro studies demonstrated that PSMA-targeted SPECT agents exhibited selective cellular uptake in the PSMA-positive LNCaP cells compared to PSMA-negative PC3 cells. More importantly, it was found that (99m) Tc(CO)(3) -DPA-DBCO-PEG(4) -CTT-54 based on an irreversible PSMA inhibitor core, exhibited greater uptake and internalization than (99m) Tc(CO)(3) -DPA-DBCO-PEG(4) -CTT-54.2 constructed from a slowly reversible PSMA inhibitor core. CONCLUSIONS We have demonstrated that a PSMA-targeted SPECT agent can be assembled efficiently using copper-less click chemistry. In addition, we demonstrated that mode of binding has an effect on internalization and percent uptake of PSMA-targeted SPECT agents; with the irreversible targeting agent demonstrating superior uptake and internalization in PSMA+ cells. The approach demonstrated in this work now supports a modular approach for the assembly of PSMA-targeted imaging and therapeutic agents.","Nedrow-Byers, Jessie R; Moore, Adam L; Ganguly, Tanushree; Hopkins, Mark R; Fulton, Melody D; Benny, Paul D; Berkman, Clifford E",The Prostate,https://doi.org/10.1002/pros.22575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22911263/,571
143031,Protocol: Leveraging a demographic and health surveillance system for Covid-19 Surveillance in rural KwaZulu-Natal.,2020,"INTRODUCTION France has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety, depression, burn out and the high proportion of post-traumatic stress disorder proved to be the most expected troubles caused by this pandemic and the confinement. Medico-psychological emergency units (CUMP) have been solicited at the very early stage of the pandemic because CUMP units are very well known by the French government and systematically associated to emergency plans. METHODS In this article we describe the process which has been developed to cope with the psychological needs in the general population. At a first level, platforms of volunteers specialised into listening were available. Then those platforms could directly mobilise the CUMP in case of psychiatric disorders. It ran over the whole first wave and it has been reactivated because of the second confinement in France. RESULTS During the first wave, approximately 1% of all the calls made on the national Covid number required to be redirected to the listening platforms. Of this group, 4% were related to reactive pathology or a psychiatric decompensating that required adapted and specialised care. CONCLUSION The high rates of psychological distress detected in the general population in recent scientific literature seem discrepant with our findings of relatively low reorientation towards the CUMP. Nevertheless, our study highlights that the response of the CUMP network in France during the first wave was supportive. The second wave displays its adaptability to the public health policies.","Prieto, Nathalie; Vignaud, Philippe; Darbon, Remy; Cheucle, Eric; Philippe, Jean-Marc",The International journal of social psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764021997492; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33663267/,571

The reduction in international travel and domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action have likely slowed the spread of the disease. Notifications in Australia remain predominantly among people with recent overseas travel, with some locally-acquired cases being detected. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a confirmed case, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked. The distribution of overseas-acquired cases to locally-acquired cases varies by jurisdiction. The crude case fatality rate (CFR) in Australia remains low (1.0%) compared to the World Health Organization's globally-reported rate (6.8%) and to other comparable high-income countries such as the United States of America (4.7%) and the United Kingdom (13.5%). The low CFR is likely reflective of high case ascertainment including detection of mild cases. High case ascertainment enables public health response and reduction of disease transmission. Internationally, cases continue to increase. The rates of increase have started to slow in several regions, although it is too soon to tell whether this trend will be sustained. Interpretation of international epidemiology should be conducted with caution as it differs from country to country depending not only on the disease dynamics, but also on differences in case detection, testing and implemented public health measures.",,Communicable diseases intelligence,https://doi.org/10.33321/cdi.2020.44.36; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32343939/,571

Starchy products were screened and classified as being either high (high-SDS) or low (low-SDS) in SDS (in vitro SDS method). A randomized controlled cross-over pilot study was performed: Eight patients with T2D consumed randomly a high-SDS or a low-SDS diet for one week each, while their glycemic profile was monitored for 6 days. Based on 250 food product SDS analyses and dietary recommendations for patients with T2D, the high-SDS and low-SDS diets were designed. The high-SDS diet significantly increased SDS intake and the SDS/carbohydrates proportion compared to the low-SDS diet (61.6 vs. 11.6 g/day and 30% vs. 6%; p < 0.0001, respectively). Increasing the SDS/carbohydrate proportion to 50% of the meal was significantly correlated with a 12% decrease in tAUC0-120 min and a 14% decrease in the glycemic peak value (p < 0.001 for both). A high-SDS diet can be easily designed by carefully selecting commercial starchy products and providing relevant recommendations for T2D to improve their glycemic profile.","Goux, Aurélie; Breyton, Anne-Esther; Meynier, Alexandra; Lambert-Porcheron, Stéphanie; Sothier, Monique; Van Den Berghe, Laurie; Brack, Olivier; Normand, Sylvie; Disse, Emmanuel; Laville, Martine; Nazare, Julie-Anne; Vinoy, Sophie",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12082404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796734/,571

Whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequence data collected from community-based diagnostic testing shows an unprecedentedly rapid expansion of the B.1.1.7 lineage during Autumn 2020, suggesting a selective advantage. We find that changes in VOC frequency inferred from genetic data correspond closely to changes inferred by S-gene target failures (SGTF) in community-based diagnostic PCR testing. Analysis of trends in SGTF and non-SGTF case numbers in local areas across England shows that the VOC has higher transmissibility than non-VOC lineages, even if the VOC has a different latent period or generation time. The SGTF data indicate a transient shift in the age composition of reported cases, with a larger share of under 20 year olds among reported VOC than non-VOC cases. Time-varying reproduction numbers for the VOC and cocirculating lineages were estimated using SGTF and genomic data. The best supported models did not indicate a substantial difference in VOC transmissibility among different age groups. There is a consensus among all analyses that the VOC has a substantial transmission advantage with a 50% to 100% higher reproduction number.","Volz, Erik; Mishra, Swapnil; Chand, Meera; Barrett, Jeffrey C; Johnson, Robert; Geidelberg, Lily; Hinsley, Wes R; Laydon, Daniel J; Dabrera, Gavin; O'Toole, Áine; Amato, Roberto; Ragonnet-Cronin, Manon; Harrison, Ian; Jackson, Ben; Ariani, Cristina V; Boyd, Olivia; Loman, Nicholas J; McCrone, John T; Gonçalves, Sónia; Jorgensen, David; Myers, Richard; Hill, Verity; Jackson, David K; Gaythorpe, Katy; Groves, Natalie; Sillitoe, John; Kwiatkowski, Dominic P; Flaxman, Seth; Ratmann, Oliver; Bhatt, Samir; Hopkins, Susan; Gandy, Axel; Rambaut, Andrew; Ferguson, Neil M",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03470-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33767447/,571

Anticipating metabolism in the lungs provides an opportunity to optimise new inhaled medicines and overcome challenges in their development. AREAS COVERED This article summarises current knowledge on xenobiotic metabolising enzymes in the lungs. The impact of metabolism on inhaled medicines is considered with examples of how this impacts small molecules, biologics and macromolecular formulation excipients. Methods for measuring and predicting xenobiotic lung metabolism are critically reviewed and the potential for metabolism to influence inhalation toxicology is acknowledged. EXPERT OPINION Drugs can be optimised by molecular modification to: (i) reduce systemic exposure using a 'soft drug' approach, (ii) improve bioavailability by resisting metabolism, or (iii) use a prodrug approach to overcome pharmacokinetic limitations. Drugs that are very labile in the lungs may require a protective formulation. Some drug carriers being investigated for PK-modification rely on lung enzymes to trigger drug release or biodegrade. Lung enzyme activity varies with age, race, smoking status, diet, drug exposure and pre-existing lung disease. New experimental technologies to study lung metabolism include tissue engineered models, improved analytical capability and in silico models.","Enlo-Scott, Zachary; Bäckström, Erica; Mudway, Ian; Forbes, Ben",Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1080/17425255.2021.1908262; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33759677/,571

Recent technological advancements in single-incision instrumentation have created more interest and widespread usage of LESS. However, neither LESS nor its novel instrumentation have been thoroughly studied or evaluated using human factors and ergonomics techniques. Consequently, the aim of this study was to compare the physical performance of LESS to CL using a standardized task. Wrist and elbow angular movements, range of motion and physical discomfort were assessed for 24 novice participants. There were no significant differences for physical comfort/discomfort ratings or elbow and wrist flexion/extension range of motion between CL and LESS. However, wrist radial/ulnar range of motion was significantly greater in LESS compared to CL (p < 0.05). Additionally, wrist radial/ ulnar range of motion was significantly greater using the SILS Port compared to the GelPOINT (p < 0.05). Although further investigation is needed, LESS resulted in greater wrist deviation and range of motion due to the close proximity of the instruments, restrictive nature of the single-port devices, and the need to achieve adequate instrument triangulation and visualization.","McCrory, Bernadette; Lowndes, Bethany R; Wirth, Laura M; de Laveaga, Adam E; LaGrange, Chad A; Hallbeck, M Susan",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-2012-0402-1884; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22316990/,571

Determining its mechanistic role in disease has been difficult due to apparent disconnects between animal and human studies and lack of an integrated multi-omics view of disease-specific physiological changes. We integrated longitudinal multi-omics data from the gut microbiome, metabolome, host epigenome, and transcriptome in the context of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) host physiology. We identified IBS subtype-specific and symptom-related variation in microbial composition and function. A subset of identified changes in microbial metabolites correspond to host physiological mechanisms that are relevant to IBS. By integrating multiple data layers, we identified purine metabolism as a novel host-microbial metabolic pathway in IBS with translational potential. Our study highlights the importance of longitudinal sampling and integrating complementary multi-omics data to identify functional mechanisms that can serve as therapeutic targets in a comprehensive treatment strategy for chronic GI diseases.

However, less is known about the use of telemedicine in sports and exercise medicine (teleSEM) and its utility to treat emergent craniofacial injuries. Given how common facial trauma is among athletes and its possible complications, incorporation of telemedicine in sports-related injuries may prove to be quintessential for athletes and coaches. METHODS A comprehensive literature search of the MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted for studies published through December 2020 with multiple search terms related to telemedicine in sports and trauma care. RESULTS Overall, teleSEM is appreciated by both patients and physicians alike. Studies show that the satisfaction rate among patients and physicians are high. Sports-related telemedicine visits can help improve resource utilization and total costs. Facial trauma studies also reveal that the level of concurrency of treatment options between telemedicine visits and in-person consultations is almost perfect. Further, there are many additional ways that teleSEM can be implemented in treating injured athletes, including possible collaboration between athletic coaches and physicians as well as mobile device applications. Telemedicine may be particularly useful in treating acute injuries in low-resourced areas with limited equipment and training. CONCLUSION Telemedicine has been widely employed for sports-related injuries and in traumatic care. Patients and providers alike have noted its utility over other methods of communication with physicians. Our findings suggest that telemedicine has a significant potential in treating sports-related injuries and improving the efficiency of diagnoses and treatments. It may enhance outcomes for participants in athletic events. This may become a key aspect of determining whether a player can return to immediate competition.","Tam, Anson; Plotsker, Ethan; Kim, Minji; Thaller, Seth R",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/scs.0000000000007576; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33654034/,571
147097,Garlic-induced face burn.,2021-03-10,"Selective attention is a core cognitive function for efficient processing of information. Although it is well known that attention can modulate neural responses in many brain areas, the computational principles underlying attentional modulation remain unclear. Contrary to the prevailing view of a high-dimensional, distributed neural representation, here we show a surprisingly simple, biased neural representation for feature-based attention in a large dataset including five human fMRI studies. We found that when human participants (both sexes) selected one feature from a compound stimulus, voxels in many cortical areas responded consistently higher to one attended feature over the other. This univariate bias was consistent across brain areas within individual subjects. Importantly, this univariate bias showed a progressively stronger magnitude along the cortical hierarchy. In frontoparietal areas, the bias was strongest and contributed largely to pattern-based decoding, whereas early visual areas lacked such a bias. These findings suggest a gradual transition from a more analog to a more abstract representation of attentional priority along the cortical hierarchy. Biased neural responses in high-level areas likely reflect a low-dimensional neural code that can facilitate a robust representation and simple readout of cognitive variables.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIt is typically assumed that cognitive variables are represented by distributed population activities. Although this view is rooted in decades of work in the sensory system, it has not been rigorously tested at different levels of cortical hierarchy. Here we show a novel low-dimensional coding scheme that dominated the representation of feature-based attention in frontoparietal areas. The simplicity of such a biased code may confer a robust representation of cognitive variables, such as attentional selection, working memory, and decision-making.","Gong, Mengyuan; Liu, Taosheng",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.0690-20.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004380/,571

Discussions of the polio crisis in Afghanistan and Pakistan have tended to focus on Taliban suspicions of a US-led public health intervention and the denunciation of 'modernity' by Islamic 'extremists'. In contrast, this paper considers a broader history of indigenous hostility and resistance to colonial immunisation on the subcontinent, suggesting how interconnected public health and political crises today have reactivated the past and created a continuity between events. The paper explores how the biomedical threat posed by polio has become intertwined with military and governmental discourses premised on the 'preemptive strike'. Here, the paper tracks the connections between biological immunity and a postcolonial politics that posits an immunological rationale for politico-military interventions.

This young, sexually active cohort had the potential to pose a threat to the wider population via heterosexual spread, and hence measures were required to prevent, where possible, a second wave of the epidemic. A coalition of health professionals, local authority groups and voluntary organisations consequently acted by producing a series of health promotional campaigns, such as the 'Take Care' campaign, in order to promote healthy and safe sexual practice and to educate the community about the risks of HIV and AIDS. Many of the strategies utilised by Lothian public bodies were pioneering, using distinctive imagery and novel marketing techniques. Despite aiming these campaigns at the broader community however, campaigns spearheaded by health providers and local government often excluded certain high-risk populations, such as drug users and gay men, and subsequently these demographic groups had to turn to other services (in voluntary, non-governmental sectors) for health education and promotion.","Johnstone, Phoebe; Williams, Louise; Demetriades, Andreas K",The journal of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh,https://doi.org/10.4997/jrcpe.2021.222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34131683/,571

151726,Presidential Powers and Response to COVID-19.,2020-03-18,"BACKGROUND Altered host immune responses are considered to play a key role in the pathogenesis of ALRI. The existing literature on cytokine responses in ALRI is largely focussed on adults from developed countries and there are few reports describing the role of cytokines in childhood ALRI, particularly in African or HIV-infected populations. OBJECTIVES To measure systemic cytokine levels in blood plasma from young South African children with and without ALRI and with and without HIV to determine associations between cytokine responses and disease status and respiratory viral identification. METHODS Blood plasma samples were collected from 106 hospitalized ALRI cases and 54 non-ALRI controls less than two years of age. HIV status was determined. Blood plasma concentrations of 19 cytokines, 7 chemokines and 4 growth factors (EGF, FGF-basic, HGF and VEGF) were measured using The Human Cytokine 30-Plex Panel. Common respiratory viruses were identified by PCR. RESULTS Mean cytokine concentrations for G-CSF, IFN-γ, IL-5 and MCP-1 were significantly higher in ALRI cases than in non-respiratory controls.Within the ALRI cases, several cytokines were higher in children with a virus compared with children without a virus. Mean cytokine concentrations for IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TNF-α and MIP-1α were significantly lower in HIV-infected cases than in HIV-uninfected cases, while IP-10 and MIG were significantly higher in HIV-infected cases than in HIV-uninfected cases. CONCLUSIONS Certain cytokines are likely to play an important role in the host immune response to ALRI. HIV-infected children have impaired inflammatory responses to respiratory infections compared with HIV-uninfected children. This article is protected by copyright.

Yet, understanding how their environment shapes diversity within species and across taxa is limited by a paucity of observations of heritability and life history. Here, we present observations of asexual reproduction, morphologic plasticity, and ontogeny in the planktic foraminifer Neogloboquadrina pachyderma in laboratory culture. Our results demonstrate that planktic foraminifera reproduce both sexually and asexually and demonstrate extensive phenotypic plasticity in response to nonheritable factors. These two processes fundamentally explain the rapid spatial and temporal response of even imperceptibly low populations of planktic foraminifera to optimal conditions and the diversity and ubiquity of these species across the range of environmental conditions that occur in the ocean.","Davis, Catherine V; Livsey, Caitlin M; Palmer, Hannah M; Hull, Pincelli M; Thomas, Ellen; Hill, Tessa M; Benitez-Nelson, Claudia R",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abb8930; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937545/,571

The etiologic agent responsible for this disease has been named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses as it shows similar genomic features to that of SARS-CoV which caused a pandemic in 2002. This disease first appeared in Hubei province of China and it follows human-to-human transmission but the path this virus took to set up human infection remains a mystery. By 17 April 2020, globally there have been 2,074,529 confirmed cases with 139,378 deaths because of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 shows several similarities with SARS?CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with its clinical presentations. This can vary from asymptomatic infection to severe disease and mortality. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) screening is considered as the standard laboratory test for the diagnosis of COVID-19. There is no proven antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 so the treatment for COVID-19 is symptomatic, aiming for the management of the symptoms and prevention of the complications. The outbreak of COVID-19 has led to the implementation of extraordinary public health measures throughout the world. Numerous antiviral compounds used to treat other infections are being clinically researched to find possible treatment. Similarly, the traditional public health outbreak response strategy of isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment has been implemented in multiple countries and has played an important role in the prevention of new outbreaks.

Glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist could be a treatment option for adolescent obesity. OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of exenatide extended release on body mass index (BMI)-SDS as primary outcome, and glucose metabolism, cardiometabolic risk factors, liver steatosis, and other BMI metrics as secondary outcomes, and its safety and tolerability in adolescents with obesity. METHODS Six-month, randomized, double-blinded, parallel, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients (n = 44, 10-18 years, females n = 22) with BMI-SDS > 2.0 or age-adapted-BMI > 30 kg/m2 according to WHO were included. Patients received lifestyle intervention and were randomized to exenatide extended release 2 mg (n = 22) or placebo (n = 22) subcutaneous injections given once weekly. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were conducted at the beginning and end of the intervention. RESULTS Exenatide reduced (P < .05) BMI-SDS (-0.09; -0.18, 0.00), % BMI 95th percentile (-2.9%; -5.4, -0.3), weight (-3 kg; -5.8, -0.1), waist circumference (-3.2 cm; -5.8, -0.7), subcutaneous adipose tissue (-552 cm3 ; -989, -114), 2-hour-glucose during OGTT (-15.3 mg/dL; -27.5, -3.1), total cholesterol (11.6 mg/dL; -21.7, -1.5), and BMI (-0.83 kg/m2 ; -1.68, 0.01) without significant change in liver fat content (-1.36; -3.12, 0.4; P = .06) in comparison to placebo. Safety and tolerability profiles were comparable to placebo with the exception of mild adverse events being more frequent in exenatide-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of adolescents with severe obesity with extended-release exenatide is generally well tolerated and leads to a modest reduction in BMI metrics and improvement in glucose tolerance and cholesterol. The study indicates that the treatment provides additional beneficial effects beyond BMI reduction for the patient group.","Weghuber, D; Forslund, A; Ahlström, H; Alderborn, A; Bergström, K; Brunner, S; Cadamuro, J; Ciba, I; Dahlbom, M; Heu, V; Hofmann, J; Kristinsson, H; Kullberg, J; Ladinger, A; Lagler, F B; Lidström, M; Manell, H; Meirik, M; Mörwald, K; Roomp, K; Schneider, R; Vilén, H; Widhalm, K; Zsoldos, F; Bergsten, P",Pediatric obesity,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijpo.12624; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32062862/,571

They are afraid to seek help due to stigmatization and environmental ostracism. The goal of the study is to analyze the psychological support and stress management programs for students supported by medical schools in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS The authors sent out e-mails with 9 questions regarding the issue being analyzed to all 19 medical schools in Poland. They obtained answers from 15 such schools, which corresponds to a response rate of 79%. The study was conducted in 2018-2019, before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. RESULTS Due to the lack of central regulations, support is provided by medical schools individually. Those solutions focus on short-term, temporary therapy. If a longer therapy is needed, students are redirected to external health providers. Moreover, information about the support is not transferred by student-friendly communication channels. CONCLUSIONS Support should be flexible, and it should quickly adapt to the emerging trends and consider students' feedback. A future model of psychological support could be a center organized as a transfer point between a university problem-solving facility and external health providers, concentrating on short-term activity. Quick support would eliminate potential complications and more serious mental problems.","Walkiewicz, Maciej; Guziak, Mateusz",International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,https://doi.org/10.13075/ijomeh.1896.01539; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33223542/,571

Recent evidence suggesting that obesity leads to tissue-specific vitamin A deficiency led to an investigation of whether high-dose oral vitamin A, a treatment used for remediating vitamin A deficiency in developing countries, could correct obesity-associated tissue deficits. METHODS Adult C57BL/6 diet-induced obese mice were supplemented with vitamin A for 4 weeks. A subset of mice were then vaccinated with inactivated influenza virus and challenged. Following supplementation, tissue vitamin A levels, lung immune cell composition, blood inflammatory cytokines, antibody responses, and viral clearance were evaluated. RESULTS Supplementation significantly improved vitamin A levels in lung and adipose tissues in diet-induced obese mice. Additionally, supplementation decreased inflammatory cytokines in the blood and altered the lung immune environment. Importantly, vaccinated, vitamin A-treated diet-induced obese mice exhibited improved antibody responses and significantly reduced viral loads post challenge compared with PBS-treated mice. CONCLUSIONS Results demonstrate a low-cost intervention that may correct vitamin A tissue deficits and help control respiratory viral infections in individuals with obesity.","Penkert, Rhiannon R; Cortez, Valerie; Karlsson, Erik A; Livingston, Brandi; Surman, Sherri L; Li, Yaqi; Catharine Ross, A; Schultz-Cherry, Stacey; Hurwitz, Julia L",Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22929; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32779401/,571

Surgeons gained expertise with the laparoscopic technique and utilized multiple variations that are now utilized in transplant centers throughout the world. Recent modifications include laparoendoscopic single-site and robotic approaches that have been adopted by an additional smaller set of programs. PURPOSE Review was performed of the following eight different surgical approaches to a ""minimally invasive"" live donor nephrectomy: laparoscopic (LDN), hand-assisted laparoscopic (HALDN), retroperitoneoscopic (RLDN), hand-assisted retroperitoneoscopic (HARS), single-port laparoscopic (LESS), robotic-assisted laparoscopic (RALDN), mini open, and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic (NOTES). The techniques are described and summaries of available outcomes and complications are presented. CONCLUSIONS Traditional surgical techniques of open donor nephrectomy have transitioned to minimally invasive techniques. With adoption of these techniques as the preferred approach, several variations have and continue to evolve. The current minimally invasive donor nephrectomy techniques share low complication rates and excellent outcomes.","Shockcor, Nicole M; Sultan, Sam; Alvarez-Casas, Josue; Brazio, Philip S; Phelan, Michael; LaMattina, John C; Barth, Rolf N",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-018-1700-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30132134/,571

METHODS Data from 18 patients (mean age 59.3±9.6 years; 11 men) treated with DEB for iliac ISR between October 2009 and August 2013 were retrospectively evaluated and compared with a control group of 22 patients (mean age 66.7±11.8 years; 16 men) treated with standard balloon angioplasty (BA). Primary endpoint of the study was the primary patency rate at 12 months. Secondary endpoints were 30-day and overall mortality, sustained clinical improvement [ankle-brachial index (ABI) and Rutherford category] and clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR). Follow-up examinations were performed by clinical examination, color duplex ultrasound, and ABI measurement at 12 months. RESULTS Mean length of the 21 lesions in the DEB group was 27.1±19.2 mm vs 20.0±11.4 mm for the 25 lesions in the BA group (p=0.508), while the grade of restenosis was 70.4%±18.4% and 64.0%±16.1% (p=0.255), respectively. Primary patency rates were 90.5% vs 85.7% at 6 months and 71.4% vs 75.6% at 12 months for DEB and BA, respectively (p=0.784). Five BA patients died during follow-up for reasons unrelated to the procedure, while no patient in the DEB group died (p=0.035). In both groups, Rutherford category and ABI significantly improved compared to pretreatment levels; there were no differences between the groups regarding these variables (p=0.367 and p=0.898, respectively). The TLR rate was 28.6% (6/21) in the DEB group and 20.0% (4/20) in the BA cohort (p=0.434). CONCLUSION Treatment of iliac ISR using DEBs is a safe procedure, with results comparable to BA treatment. Because of the limited number of patients in this study, further investigation of a larger cohort with longer follow-up is needed to define the role of DEBs in the treatment of iliac ISR.","Stahlhoff, Stefan; Donas, Konstantinos P; Torsello, Giovanni; Osada, Nani; Herten, Monika",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1526602815583851; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25991767/,571

Skin sensitization is a complex end point that was for a long time being evaluated using animal testing. Great efforts have been made to completely substitute the use of animals and replace them by integrating data from in vitro and in chemico assays with in silico calculated parameters. However, it remains undefined how to make the best use of the cumulative data in such a way that information gain is maximized and accomplished with the fewest number of tests possible. In this work, 3 skin sensitization prediction models were considered: one to discriminate sensitizers from non-sensitizers, considering a 2-level scale; one according to the GHS, considering a 3-level scale; and the other to categorize potency in a 6-level scale, according to available human data. We used a data set of known human skin allergens for which in vitro, in chemico, and in silico descriptors where available to build classifiers based on soft and hard multivariate modeling. Model building, optimization, and refinement resulted in 100% accuracy in distinguishing between sensitizers and non-sensitizers. The same model was able to perform the characterization, in 3 and 6 levels, respectively, with 98.8 and 97.5% accuracy. Combining data from in vitro and in chemico tests with in silico descriptors is relatively simple to implement and some predictors are fitting the adverse outcome pathway for skin sensitization.","Silva, Filipa A L S; Brites, Gonçalo; Ferreira, Isabel; Silva, Ana; Miguel Neves, Bruno; Costa Pereira, Jorge L G F S; Cruz, Maria T",International journal of toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1177/1091581820944395; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32757797/,571
157388,"High dosage of methylprednisolone as a rescue, second-line treatment in COVID-19 patients who failed to respond to tocilizumab.",2020-08-19,"In proposing his genetic feedback mechanism, David Pimentel was one of the first biologists to argue that the reciprocal interplay of ecological and evolutionary dynamics is an important process regulating population dynamics and ultimately affecting community composition. Although the past decade has seen an increase in research activity on these so-called eco-evolutionary dynamics, there remains a conspicuous lack of compelling natural examples of such feedback. Here we argue that this lack may be due to an inherent difficulty in detecting eco-evolutionary dynamics in nature. By examining models of virulence evolution, host resistance evolution, and antigenic evolution, we show that the influence of evolution on ecological dynamics can often be obscured by other ecological processes that yield similar dynamics. We then show, however, that mechanistic models can be used to navigate this, in Pimentel's words, ""devious"" course of evolution when effectively combined with empirical data. We argue that these models, improving upon Pimentel's original mathematical models, will therefore play an increasingly important role in identifying more subtle, but possibly ubiquitous, eco-evolutionary dynamics in nature. To highlight the importance of identifying these potentially subtle dynamics in nature, we end by considering our ability to anticipate the effect of population control strategies in the presence of these eco-evolutionary feedbacks.","Luo, Shishi; Koelle, Katia",The American naturalist,https://doi.org/10.1086/669952; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23598360/,571

Evidence about these significant changes indicated that college students were more prone to feel anxious and depressed. To derive a precise assessment of the prevalence of anxiety symptom and depressive symptom among college students worldwide, we conducted this meta-analysis. METHODS Based on the guidance of PRISMA, literature was searched in Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, and PsycArticles (last search November 6, 2020). These articles after the screening were analyzed by a random-effects model to estimate the pooled prevalence of anxiety symptom and depressive symptom. Also, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias were performed in this meta-analysis. RESULTS The results showed that the pooled anxiety symptom prevalence was 31% (95% CI: 23-39%), pooled depressive symptom prevalence was 34% (95% CI: 27-41%). Subgroup analysis showed that the prevalence of anxiety symptom and depressive symptom among different countries' college students were different, and the pooled depressive symptom prevalence of females was higher compared with males. LIMITATIONS The prevalence of anxiety symptom and depressive symptom in worldwide college students could be better assessed by a standard and reliable questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that the prevalence of anxiety symptom and depressive symptom during the COVID-19 pandemic is relatively high. Except for interventions that should be taken to control the pandemic urgently, mental health services are also needed to decrease the risk of anxiety and depression among college students.","Chang, Jun-Jie; Ji, Yan; Li, Yong-Han; Pan, Hai-Feng; Su, Pu-Yu",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.05.109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34134022/,571
158189,The Auditory N1 in Schizophrenia: Comparative Analysis with a Monoaural Stimuli Paradigm.,2020,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a well-recognized microvascular complication of diabetes. Growing evidence suggests that in addition to retinal vascular damage, there is significant damage to retinal neural tissue in DR. Studies reveal neuronal damage before clinically evident vascular lesions and DR is now classified as a neuro-vascular complication. Hyperglycemia causes retinal damage through complex metabolic pathways leading to oxidative stress, inflammation, vascular damage, capillary ischemia and retinal tissue hypoxia. Retinal hypoxia is further worsened by high oxygen consumption in the rods. Persistent hypoxia results in increases in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other pro-angiogenic factors leading to proliferative DR/macular edema and progressive visual impairment. Optimal glucose control has favorable effects in DR. Other treatments for DR include laser photocoagulation, which improves retinal oxygenation by destroying the high oxygen consuming rods and their replacement by low oxygen consuming glial tissue. Hypoxia is a potent stimulator of VEGF, and intra-vitreal anti-VEGF antibodies are effective in regressing macular edema and in some studies, retinal neovascularization. In this review, we highlight the complex pathophysiology of DR with a focus on retinal oxygen/fuel consumption and hypoxic damage to retinal neurons. We discuss potential mechanisms through which SGLT2-inhibitors improve retinal hypoxia - through ketone bodies which are energetically as efficient as glucose and yield more ATP per molecule of oxygen consumed than fat, along with less oxidative stress. Retinal benefits would occur through improved fuel energetics, less hypoxia and through the anti-inflammatory/oxidative stress effects of ketone bodies. Well-designed studies are needed to explore this hypothesis.","Mudaliar, Sunder; Hupfeld, Christopher; Chao, Daniel L",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgab050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33512450/,571
158198,"Advancing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Hospital Medicine.",2021-02-17,"OBJECTIVES Minimally invasive thoracic procedures have been increasingly used; however, only a small number of lobectomies are performed by videothoracoscopy, showing the need for training on this technique. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the technique of lobectomy using videothoracoscopy in swine, highlighting the steps to be taken during its use in surgical experimentation. METHODS During the advanced course on video-assisted and thoracoscopic procedures carried out at IRCAD Latin America, Barretos, Brazil, 40 swine were used for the hands-on course on video-assisted upper left lobectomy. Monopulmonary ventilation was performed by blocking the left main bronchus. Surgical procedures were performed using three ports and the anterior dissection technique (fissureless approach). The pulmonary hilar structures were dissected using conventional open surgery and video-assisted surgical tools. The first structure treated in the approach of the hilar structures was the upper lobe vein, followed by the bronchus and the branches of the pulmonary artery. RESULTS The mean time required to anaesthetize the animals was 3 h. Intraoperative hypoventilation was observed in 26 animals (65%) and 4 (10%) of them had a poor outcome and died in the last third part of the surgery. Eight (20%) animals had bradycardia, and six responded to the use of atropine. In two (5%), it was not possible to revert the bradycardia and the animals died at the end of the procedures. The surgical procedures had a mean duration of 3 h and the total time of anaesthesia was about 6 h. DISCUSSION Swine have been frequently used for hands-on training in surgery but there are no reports in the literature describing the anatomical, anaesthetic and technical peculiarities that must be observed during videothoracoscopic lobectomy training in swine. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy using swine is an adequate method to train thoracic surgeons. For surgeons to make the best use of minimally invasive technique training, it is essential that issues related to the anatomy, anaesthesia, monopulmonary ventilation and surgical technique described in this study are taken into account.","Tedde, Miguel L; Brito Filho, Flavio; Belmonte, Emilio de Almeida; Pinto Filho, Darcy Ribeiro; Pereira, Sergio Tadeu Fortunato Lima; Okumura, Erica Mie; Melani, Armando G Franchini; Gossot, Dominique",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/icvts/ivv138; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26015506/,571

Twenty-seven participants (M = 25.26, SD = 5.35) whose consumption was more motivated by symbolic needs (vs. functional) were instructed to perform a visual task to evaluate the naturalness of the target stimuli. As hypothesized, the subjective evaluation showed that they had lower attitudes and perceived higher unnaturalness when the symbolic brand was recommended by AI (vs. human). Based on this self-report, two epochs were segmented for the ERP analysis: human-natural and AI-unnatural. As revealed by P100 amplitude modulation on visual modality of two agents, their evaluation relied more on face image rather than text. Furthermore, this tendency was consistently observed in that of N170 amplitude when the agent identity was defined as human. However, when the agent identity was defined as AI, reversed N170 modulation was observed, indicating that participants referred more to textual information than graphical information to assess the naturalness of the agent.","Chung, Kyungmi; Park, Jin Young; Park, Kiwan; Kim, Yaeri",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s20175016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899441/,571

159614,CUBA'S COVID-19 STRATEGY: UPDATED EPIDEMIC CONTROL AND RECOVERY MEASURES.,2020-07-01,"The d-wave superconductor CeCoIn_{5} has been proposed as a strong candidate for supporting the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state near the low-temperature boundary of its upper critical field. Neutron diffraction, however, finds spin-density-wave (SDW) order in this part of the phase diagram for field in the a-b plane, and evidence for the SDW disappears as the applied field is rotated toward the tetragonal c axis. It is important to understand the interplay between the SDW and a possible FFLO state in CeCoIn_{5}, as the mere existence of an SDW does not necessarily exclude an FFLO state. Here, based on a model constructed on the basis of available experiments, we show that an FFLO state competes with an SDW phase. The SDW state in CeCoIn_{5} is stabilized when the field is directed close to the a-b plane. When the field is rotated toward the c axis, the FFLO state emerges, and the SDW phase disappears. In the FFLO state, the nodal planes with extra quasiparticles (where the superconducting order parameter is zero) are perpendicular to the field, and in the SDW phase, the quasiparticle density of states is reduced. We test this model prediction by measuring heat transported by normal quasiparticles in the superconducting state. As a function of field, we observe a reduction of thermal conductivity for field close to the a-b plane and an enhancement of thermal conductivity when field is close to the c axis, consistent with theoretical expectations. Our modeling and experiments, therefore, indicate the existence of the FFLO state when field is parallel to the c axis.","Lin, Shi-Zeng; Kim, Duk Y; Bauer, Eric D; Ronning, Filip; Thompson, J D; Movshovich, Roman",Physical review letters,https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.124.217001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530696/,571

METHODS All patients with anterior circulation stroke enrolled in the German Stroke Registry-Endovascular Treatment from 07/2015 to 04/2018 were analysed. National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) on admission, NIHSS percentage change, NIHSS delta and NIHSS at 24 hours as well as existing binary definitions of early neurological improvement (ENI; improvement of 8 (major ENI)/10 (dramatic ENI) NIHSS points or reaching 0/1 were compared for predicting functional outcome at 90 days using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Excellent and favourable outcome were defined as 0-1 and 0-2, respectively. RESULTS Among 2262 endovasculary treated patients with acute ischaemic anterior circulation stroke, NIHSS at 24 hours had the highest discriminative ability to predict excellent (receiver operator characteristics (ROC)NIHSS 24 hours area under the curve (AUC) 0.86 (0.84-0.88)) and favourable long-term functional outcome (ROCNIHSS 24 hours AUC 0.86 (0.85-0.88)) in comparison to NIHSS percentage change (ROC% change AUC mRS ≤1: 0.81 (0.78-0.83) mRS ≤2: 0.81 (0.79-0.83)), NIHSS delta change (ROCΔ change AUC mRS ≤1: 0.74 (0.72-0.77), mRS ≤2: 0.77 (0.74-0.79)) and NIHSS admission (ROCAdm AUC mRS ≤1: 0.70 (0.68-0.73), mRS ≤2: 0.67 (0.68-0.71)).

161695,Covid-19: Study to assess pandemic's effects on wellbeing of NHS staff.,2020-10-09,"Essential oils and their chemical constituents have been reported with well documented antimicrobial effects against a range of bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens. By definition, essential oils are a complex mixture of volatile organic compounds which are synthesized naturally in different parts of the plant as part of plants secondary metabolism. The chemical composition of the essential oils is dominated by the presence of a range of compounds including phenolics, terpenoids, aldehydes, ketones, ethers, epoxides and many others inferring that essential oils must be effective against a wide range of pathogens. This review article mainly focuses on the antiviral potential of essential oils and their chemical constituents especially against influenza and coronaviruses. Essential oils have been screened against several pathogenic viruses, including influenza and other respiratory viral infections. The essential oils of cinnamon, bergamot, lemongrass, thyme, lavender have been reported to exert potent antiviral effects against influenza type A virus. The essential oil of Citrus reshni leaves has been shown to be effective against H5N1 virus. The essential oil of Lippia species at a concentration of 11.1 μg/mL has been shown to induce 100% inhibition of yellow fever virus in Vero cells. Essential oils and oleoresins have been shown through in vitro and in vivo experiments to induce antiviral effects against Coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus. A study reported 221 phytochemical compounds and essential oils to be effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) using a cell-based assay measuring SARS-CoV-induced cytopathogenic effect on Vero E6 cells. The main mechanism of antiviral effects of essential oils has been found to cause capsid disintegration and viral expansion which prevents the virus to infect host cells by adsorption via the capsid. Essential oils also inhibit hemagglutinin (an important membrane protein of various viruses) of certain viruses; this membrane protein allows the virus to enter the host cell. Many essential oils and their components could inhibit the late stages of viral life cycle by targeting the redox signalling pathway. Essential oils of Thymus vulgaris, cymbopogon citratus and Rosmarinus officinalis have been found to destabilize the Tat/TAR-RNA complex of HIV-1 virus, this complex being essential for HIV-1 replication. Being lipophilic in nature, essential oils can penetrate viral membranes easily leading to membrane disintegration. The current comprehensive review will facilitate researchers to find chemical entities from plant sources as possible inhibitory agents against various viruses.","Wani, Abdul Rouf; Yadav, Kanchan; Khursheed, Aadil; Rather, Manzoor Ahmad",Microbial pathogenesis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104620; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33212200/,571

The causative strain was classified as enteroaggregative E. coli of serotype O104:H4 that had acquired Shiga toxin genes. The ability of STEC O104:H4 to cause disease relies greatly on the bacteria's capacity to colonize, persist, and produce Shiga toxin. However, not much is known about the colonization factors of this strain. Because long polar fimbriae (lpf) lpf1 and lpf2 operons encode important colonization factors in other STEC isolates and E. coli O104:H4 possesses both loci, we hypothesized that Lpf is required for adhesion and colonization. In this study, isogenic lpfA1 and lpfA2 major fimbrial subunit mutants were constructed. To determine their role in O104:H4's virulence, we assessed their ability to adhere to non-polarized and polarized intestinal epithelial cells. The ΔlpfA1 showed decreased adherence in both cell systems, while the ΔlpfA2 only showed a decrease in adherence to polarized Caco-2 cells. We also tested the O104:H4 mutants' ability to form biofilm and found that the ΔlpfA1 was unable to form a stable biofilm. In an in vivo murine model of intestinal colonization, the ΔlpfA1 had a reduced ability to colonize the cecum and large intestine, consistent with the in vitro data. Further, we tested the lpfA1 mutants' ability to compete against the wild type. We found that in the in vitro and in vivo models, the presence of the wild type O104:H4 facilitates increased adherence of the ΔlpfA1 to levels exceeding that of the wild type. Overall, our data demonstrated that Lpf1 is one of the factors responsible for O104:H4 intestinal adhesion and colonization.","Ross, Brittany N; Rojas-Lopez, Maricarmen; Cieza, Roberto J; McWilliams, Brian D; Torres, Alfredo G",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0141845; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26517878/,571

Owing to the peculiar features of the metal centers that are currently used in medicinal chemistry, metallodrugs might offer an excellent opportunity to achieve this goal. AREAS COVERED Two main strategies for developing metal-based drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 are herein illustrated. Firstly, a few clinically approved metallodrugs could be evaluated in patients according to a 'drug repurposing' approach. To this respect, the gold drug auranofin seems a promising candidate, but some other clinically established metal compounds are worthy of a careful evaluation as well. On the other hand, libraries of inorganic compounds, featuring a large chemical diversity, should be screened to identify the most effective molecules. This second strategy might be assisted by a pathway-driven discovery approach arising from a preliminary knowledge of the mode of action, exploitable to inhibit the functional activities of the key viral proteins. Also, attention must be paid to selectivity and toxicity issues. EXPERT OPINION The medicinal inorganic chemistry community may offer a valuable contribution against COVID-19. The screening of metallodrugs' libraries can expand the explored 'chemical space' and increase the chance of finding effective anti-COVID agents.","Cirri, Damiano; Pratesi, Alessandro; Marzo, Tiziano; Messori, Luigi",Expert opinion on drug discovery,https://doi.org/10.1080/17460441.2020.1819236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32915656/,571

Broadcast spawning of marine organisms is under particularly stringent conditions, since eggs released into the water column can be exposed to multiple different sperm. Bindin isolated from the sperm acrosome results in insoluble particles that cause homospecific eggs to aggregate, whereas no aggregation occurs with heterospecific eggs. Therefore, Bindin is concluded to play a critical role in fertilization, yet its function has never been tested. Here we report that Cas9-mediated inactivation of the bindin gene in a sea urchin results in perfectly normal-looking embryos, larvae, adults, and gametes in both males and females. What differed between the genotypes was that the bindin -/- sperm never fertilized an egg, functionally validating Bindin as an essential gamete interaction protein at the level of sperm-egg cell surface binding.","Wessel, Gary M; Wada, Yuuko; Yajima, Mamiko; Kiyomoto, Masato",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2109636118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400506/,571

Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) was first discovered in the 1970s and is now considered a principal pathogen implicated in the disease complex. Outbreaks occur annually and re-infections are common even in the presence of maternal antibodies. Difficulties have arisen from using both live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines and recent efforts have focused on the development of sub-unit vaccines that are suitable for use in neonatal calves with maternally-derived circulating antibodies. This study was undertaken to identify antigenic epitopes on two of the surface glycoproteins of BRSV, the fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins, the major surface viral antigens, for inclusion into a novel subunit peptide vaccine. Sequencing and antigenicity prediction of the F and G genes of BRSV revealed 21 areas of potential antigenicity; of which genuine peptide/antisera binding occurred with 4 peptides. Identification of the antigenic components of a vaccine is an important first step in the development of novel BRSV vaccines and this data, therefore, provides the basis for the generation of such vaccines.","Lemon, J.; Douglas, A.; Power, U.; McMenamy, MJ.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.25.449873,571

Methods: The TCMSP database was employed to collect and screen the active ingredients of the Chinese herb contained in the XBJ injection. The GeneCards database and STRING database were applied to collect and expand the targets of COVID-19 and compare and screen the related targets of COVID-19 by XBJ injection. Cytoscape was employed to build a network connecting Chinese medicine, compounds, targets, disease, and topology analysis was performed via the Network Analyzer to screen the key ingredients and targets. The software of Schrödinger molecular docking was used to verify the binding activity of the key ingredients of XBJ injection and the key targets of COVID-19. Metascape platform and DAVID database were utilized to conduct Gene Ontology analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis on the key targets of COVID-19 treated by XBJ injection. Results: Eight key compounds and 15 key targets were screened and verified by molecular docking; these key compounds included luteolin, quercetin, baicalein, and kaempferol.

163109,The Post-COVID-19 Era: Interdisciplinary Demands of Contagion Surveillance Mass Spectrometry for Future Pandemics,2021,"Background: Surges in community SARS-CoV-2 incidence increase risk of importation and subsequent transmission in healthcare facilities. Antigen rapid diagnostic testing (Ag-RDT) is widely used for population screening, but its health and economic benefits as a reactive intervention in healthcare settings are unclear. Methods: We used stochastic, individual-based modelling to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a long-term care facility with varying COVID-19 containment measures in place (social distancing, face masks, vaccination). In contrast to routine symptomatic testing using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we evaluated the efficacy and health-economic efficiency of single or repeated population-wide Ag-RDT screening interventions implemented in response to surges in nosocomial outbreak risk. Results: Depending on the baseline containment measures in place, nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 incidence was reduced by up to 40-47% (range of means) with routine RT-PCR testing, 59-63% with the addition of a timely round of Ag-RDT screening, and 69-75% with well-timed two-round screening. For the latter, a delay of 4 to 5 days between the first and second rounds was optimal for transmission prevention. Efficacy varied depending on test sensitivity, subpopulations targeted, and SARS-CoV-2 incidence in the community. Efficiency, however, varied primarily depending on the other containment measures in place: surveillance costs for a combined strategy of routine RT-PCR testing and reactive Ag-RDT screening ranged from a mean {euro}420-{euro}10,260/infection averted across scenarios (default unit costs: {euro}5/Ag-RDT test, {euro}50/RT-PCR test). Interpretation: Reactive Ag-RDT screening complements routine RT-PCR testing, and systematic two-round screening helps overcome limited, time-varying diagnostic sensitivity. Health-economic gains scale significantly with underlying nosocomial outbreak risk.","Smith, D. R.; Duval, A.; Zahar, J.

163110,"Ecology, democracy, and covid-19: Rereading and radicalizing Karl Polanyi",2021,"The face-to-face university classes were abruptly transferred to virtual environments during the pandemic of COVID-19, which generated changes in teaching routine and environmental impacts associated with them. Considering this reality, studies comparing the environmental impacts of face-to-face and remote classes can be of great value. In this sense, this study performed a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of face-to-face and remote university classes in a Higher Education institution in the context of COVID-19. Inputs of energy and materials (food, office materials), outputs (air and water emissions, and solid waste) were gathered in situ for the functional unit of 2 hours of face-to-face or virtual class per week for 60 engineering students. Thirteen midpoint impact categories were selected by using the recent Impact World+ midpoint method for Continental Latin America, version 1.251. In the literature, most papers about the environmental management of educational activities focus on the energy efficiency of buildings and electronic equipment during their use. But this study revealed other environmental hotspots primarily associated with meal consumption followed by ethanol fuel use. Meal consumption patterns can be explained by the fact that people usually eat more often during home-office activities. Otherwise, the transportation impacts due to ethanol use are related mainly to face-to-face classes, as much transport is required such as for food supply and student transportation. Finally, an uncertainty and a sensitivity analysis were designed for the LCA conclusions. We concluded that remote classes during the COVID-19 pandemic tend to minimize the overall evaluated impacts to ten of the thirteen impact categories. An optimal scenario was also proposed showing an overall minimization of the impacts by up to 57%, if a hybrid class model were to be adopted. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Silva, D. A.

163150,Improving patient communication with relatives during the COVID-19 lockdown,2020,"This article examines British newspaper coverage of Muslims during the first wave of the Coronavirus crisis. A well-established trajectory of research shows that Muslims are negativized in mainstream media representation in the UK. However, it became obvious from the outset of the pandemic, that ethnic minority key workers were disproportionately affected by Coronavirus. This, alongside high levels of support for NHS staff, had the potential to challenge and shift established narratives about Muslims as questions of structural discrimination became the subject of news media discourse. This article examines whether these events were able, even momentarily, to disrupt dominant narratives about Muslims in the UK or whether the pandemic provided further opportunity for Othering discourses to be perpetuated. In the context of a tumultuous political landscape, where the politics of immigration have been linked to the politics of austerity, Muslims have been scapegoated as a threat to the nationalist project. In this context, the identifier ?Muslim? is only deemed relevant if it signifies ?difference?, or to distinguish between good versus bad Muslim/immigrant. Hence, in the context of the reporting of Coronavirus, racist discourses have been reshaped as Muslim key workers are distinguished in the reporting from other Muslims. We examine how these representational practices play out through an analysis of four British newspapers (The Sun, Daily Mail, The Telegraph and The Mirror) over a months? coverage at the peak of the crisis (April, 2020).","Poole, Elizabeth Williamson Milly",Journalism,https://doi.org/10.1177/14648849211030129,571

The model is shown to exhibit the dynamical property of backward bifurcation when the associated reproduction number is less than unity. The global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium of the model is proven not to exist. The necessary conditions for the existence of optimal control and the optimality system for the model is established using the Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Numerical simulations of the optimal control model reveal that malaria drug resistance can greatly influence the co-infection cases averted, even in the presence of treatment controls for co-infected individuals.","Omame, D.

Disease ecology formed as an interdisciplinary field in the 1970s to fill this need and has recently rapidly grown in size and influence. Because interdisciplinary fields integrate diverse scientific expertise and training experiences, understanding their composition and research priorities is often difficult. Here, for the first time, we quantify the composition and educational experiences of a subset of disease ecology practitioners and identify topical trends in published research. We combined a large survey of self-declared disease ecologists with a literature synthesis involving machine-learning topic detection of over 18,500 disease ecology research articles. The number of graduate degrees earned by disease ecology practitioners has grown dramatically since the early 2000s. Similar to other science fields, we show that practitioners in disease ecology have diversified in the last decade in terms of gender identity and institution, with weaker diversification in race and ethnicity. Topic detection analysis revealed how the frequency of publications on certain topics have declined (e.g., HIV, serology), increased (e.g., the dilution effect, infectious disease in bats), remained relatively common (e.g., malaria ecology, influenza, vaccine research and development), or have consistently remained relatively infrequent (e.g., theoretical models, field experiments). Other topics, such as climate change, superspreading, emerging infectious diseases, and network analyses, have recently come to prominence. This study helps identify the major themes of disease ecology and demonstrates how publication frequency corresponds to emergent health and environmental threats. More broadly, our approach provides a framework to examine the composition and publication trends of other major research fields that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries.","Brandell, Ellen E.; Becker, Daniel J.; Sampson, Laura; Forbes, Kristian M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.16.207100,571
164115,Communicating personalised risks from COVID-19: guidelines from an empirical study,,"Information technology has become embedded in almost every area of modern life. The many complex digital systems that support modern societies are now highly dependent on the correct function of complex and highly interdependent technological systems. Digital tools are increasingly becoming part of traditional crisis response efforts by government and non-government organisations. While digital tools have substantial capabilities to enhance crisis response efforts, they also pose significant risks to user communities when deployed in time-sensitive, vulnerable and fragile crisis contexts - as part of an already complex system. These risks and inefficiencies have been demonstrated in the contact-tracing application debate in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Technology must be intentionally designed and implemented, both to help solve the problem at hand and support end user communities. The principles of simple, secure and survivable systems (S4) offer a framework for technology that serves the interests of end-users and maintains human dignity, especially in crisis situations. The S4 principles are already evident in a number of technology projects, across research, design, build and deployment phases. Instead of high-risk, ad hoc, reactive digital solutions, crisis responders can pre-emptively share information, invest and work with existing technology design and development experts that reflect the S4 principles for efficient, effective solutions that enhance response capabilities both now and in future scenarios.","Nabben, K.; Gardner-Stephen, P.; Ieee,",2020 Ieee Global Humanitarian Technology Conference,https://doi.org/10.1109/ghtc46280.2020.9342856,571

Material and methods: We analyzed the results of 1003 CT examinations of the chest performed in patients (6.2 %-children 12-14 years, 15.3 %-adolescents 15-19 years, 60.1 %-adults 20-64 years, 18.4 %-older persons 65 years and older) with suspected COVID-19 during one week in October 2020 in the city diagnostic center. In each group, the average effective dose (ED, mSv) was calculated. Results: The average ED values and confidence intervals (P=0.05) for patients with a single CT scan were: in children 2.59±0.19 mSv, in adolescents 3.23±0.17 mSv, in adults 3.43±0.08 mSv, in older persons 3.28±0.19 mSv. The maximum radiation risk indicators were observed in groups of children (24.1×10-5) and adolescents (23.3×10-5). For adult patients the means risk was 14.4×10-5. In groups of women radiation risk was 1.3-2.3 twice as high, as in male patients. The risk values in children, adolescents and adults are in the range 10×10-5- 100×10-5(low), for the older patients were 2.6×10-5(very low). Conclusion: Because of the study established effective radiation doses for chest CT of patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19 and the radiation risk for 1-3 times chest CT by age and sex of patients was calculated. It was found that the radiation risk for single, double and triple chest CT for patients under 65 is low, 65 and older is very low. Taking into account the radiation risk during CT is necessary to reduce the long-term consequences of radiation exposure on the population. © 2021 State Research Center, Burnasyan Federal Medical Biophysical Center of Federal Medical Biological Agency.

Humoral vaccination response is impaired in these patients when circulating B cells are lacking. We aimed to analyze B-cell subsets at the time of vaccination to identify potential predictors of humoral vaccination response. Methods Patients (n=120) receiving B-cell-depleting therapy (n=41), those suffering from inborn errors of immunity (n=25) and hematologic malignancies (n=56), and healthy controls (n=79) were vaccinated twice with BNT162b2 or mRNA 1273. B-cell subsets were analyzed prior to vaccination. Two independent anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassays targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) or trimeric S protein (TSP) were performed three to four weeks after the second vaccination. Results Seroconversion occurred in 100% of the healthy controls, in contrast to 67% (RBD) and 82% (TSP) of the patients, while only 32% (RBD) and 22% (TSP) achieved antibody levels comparable to those of healthy controls. The number of circulating naive B cell was strongly associated with antibody levels (r=0.761, P<0.001) across all immunosuppressive treatments or conditions. In multivariable analysis, the number of naive B cells was an independent predictor for achieving antibody levels comparable to healthy controls, and receiver operating characteristic analysis predicted that at least six naive B cells per microL were required. Conclusions Assessing the abundance of naive B cells in immunocompromised patients could be useful in predicting the optimal vaccination response.","Schulz, E.; Hodl, I.; Forstner, P.; Hatzl, S.; Sareban, N.; Moritz, M.; Fessler, J.; Dreo, B.; Uhl, B.; Url, C.; Grisold, A.; Khalil, M.; Kleinhappl, B.; Enzinger, C.; Stradner, M.

For example, the chemical structure of favipiravir—an antiviral treatment for influenza—resembles the structure of some components of RNA. Represented as graphs, such compounds are similar to a subgraph of favipiravir. However, the existing supergraph search methods can only discover compounds that match exactly. We propose a novel problem, called similar supergraph search, and design an efficient algorithm to solve it. The problem is to identify all graphs in a database that are similar to any subgraph of a query graph, where similarity is defined as edit distance. Our algorithm represents the set of candidate subgraphs by a code tree, which it uses to efficiently compute edit distance. With a distance threshold of zero, our algorithm is equivalent to an existing efficient algorithm for exact supergraph search. Our experiments show that the computation time increased exponentially as the distance threshold increased, but increased sublinearly with the number of graphs in the database.","Yamada, Masataka",Algorithms,https://doi.org/10.3390/a14080225,571

164359,Covid-19 impact on research and publication ethics,2021,"Currently, in the context of severe quarantine restrictions, one of the promising areas of the formation and development of the higher education system is the problem of its comprehensive informatization, which is based, first of all, on improving the information and educational environment for learning and the development of distance learning. Therefore, serious attention is paid to the development and implementation of modern information technologies in teaching practice. All this fully applies to the development of distance learning, which allows each person to improve their educational level with a minimum interruption from production, in their free time and according to an individual training program. Taking this into account, at the present stage of reforming the higher education system in the world, it is becoming more and more difficult to look for effective directions for training highly qualified specialists using traditional teaching aids, to respond promptly and promptly to the emerging needs of the labor market without understanding a large amount of relevant and accurate information. The article carried out a theoretical and methodological study of the very essence of distance education, and also investigated the main methods for assessing this type of education in a pandemic situation. The novelty of the article lies in the acquisition of the development of theoretical and methodological aspects of methods for assessing distance education in COVID-19 conditions.

Thus, finding the most effective fiscal policy solutions to ensure a smoother economic recovery from the pandemic effects becomes a major concern worldwide. As compared to more developed countries, developing economies tend to have harder and usually longer recovery periods from economic crises. Therefore, this paper aims to study the changes in fiscal policies in correlation with the evolutions and transformations of the labour market for a case of a developing country. Evidence for the case of Romania is provided, where labour force participation is very low and youth unemployment is among the highest in Europe.

Alongside this pandemic, people have experienced a parallel infodemic, i.e., an overabundance of information, some of which is misleading or even harmful, which has widely spread around the globe. Although social media are increasingly being used as the information source, web search engines, such as Google or Yahoo!, still represent a powerful and trustworthy resource for finding information on the Web. This is due to their capability to capture the largest amount of information, helping users quickly identify the most relevant, useful, although not always the most reliable, results for their search queries. This study aims to detect potential misleading and fake contents by capturing and analysing textual information, which flow through search engines. By using a real-world dataset associated with recent COVID-19 pandemic, we first apply re-sampling techniques for class imbalance, and then we use existing machine learning algorithms for classification of not reliable news. By extracting lexical and host-based features of associated uniform resource locators (URLs) for news articles, we show that the proposed methods, so common in phishing and malicious URL detection, can improve the efficiency and performance of classifiers. Based on these findings, we suggest that the use of both textual and URL features can improve the effectiveness of fake news detection methods.","Mazzeo, V.; Rapisarda, A.; Giuffrida, G.",Frontiers in Physics,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2021.685730,571

Entrepreneurial Intentions Approach for Academia in Pakistan,2021,"Enteroviruses are non-enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses that cause diverse diseases in humans. Their rapid multiplication depends on remodeling of cytoplasmic membranes for viral genome replication. New virions are thought to be assembled near the genome replication sites and are released in vesicles through secretory autophagy. Here, we use cryo-electron tomography to show that poliovirus assembles directly on replication membranes. Assembly progression beyond a membrane-bound half-capsid intermediate requires the host lipid kinase VPS34, whereas inhibition of ULK1, the initiator of canonical autophagy, leads to accumulation of virions in vast intracellular arrays followed by an increased release at later time points. We further identify multiple layers of selectivity in virus-induced autophagy, with a strong selection for RNA-loaded virions over empty capsids and the segregation of virions from a second class of autophagic membranes containing protein filaments bundles. These findings provide an integrated structural framework for multiple stages of the poliovirus life cycle.","Dahmane, Selma; Kerviel, Adeline; Morado, Dustin R.; Shankar, Kasturika; Ahlman, Björn; Lazarou, Michael; Altan-Bonnet, Nihal; Carlson, Lars-Anders",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.06.463375,571

The aim of this natural experiment is to study the changes in maternal parenting as perceived by adolescents (psychological control, autonomy support, and overcontrol) as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown. The data for T1 were collected in February 2020 and a follow-up was conducted in May 2020 (approximately 8 weeks after lockdown). In total, 155 adolescents participated in both waves (mean age 14.5 years, 60.4% girls). The final sample was biased toward higher achieving pupils with less problematic behavior and more adaptable personality characteristics. The results show a significant decrease in perceived psychological control and feelings of overcontrol but no change in autonomy support. The changes did not vary according to gender or the mother’s employment situation during lockdown. The decrease in psychological control was greater with higher initial levels of satisfaction with the mother and lower levels of disobeying parents. The present study is an important step in understanding the actual changes in parenting (as perceived by adolescents) as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown.

In this study, we propose a framework for modeling the emotion space of companion robots to facilitate their emotion generation and transition based on Plutchik’s wheel of emotions and reversible quantum circuit schemes. Superposition encodings allow fewer computing resources for the generation and storage of emotional states, and by using unitary operations, they facilitate easier emotion transition and recovery over different intervals. Further, an encryption strategy is designed based on the emotion communication architecture to secure the emotion-related data in human-robot interaction.

The purpose of this article is to analyze the didactic aspects of the experience of using EDL methods and technological tools during a pandemic, to assess the potential positive and real negativity of this process, to develop recommendations on the rational use of modern virtual learning environments. The study is based on methods of systemic analysis, pedagogical psychology and didacticism, long-term experience of authors in the field of EDL. The analysis of two main didactic approaches in the modern EDL was carried out: classes in a virtual classroom, most of which copy traditional methods of classroom learning, and predominantly independent cognitive activities of students in learning management systems using specially trained digital educational resources. It has been shown that much of the negative aspects of EDL during the coronavirus pandemic are due to attempts to implement rudiments of the usual classroom learning system with the help of innovative electronic technologies. Recommendations have been made on the structure of the electronic distance course in modern learning management systems, which provide for the freedom to choose the time and place of study with them with the necessary regulation of the content and the learning process inherent in formal education institutions. A number of positive aspects of EDL related to its quality, ever-widening application boundaries, educational potential and economic feasibility have been considered. The importance of properly assessing possible negative aspects of EDL is shown. The reason for which is not in electronic tools, but in didacticly incorrect methods of training with them.

The financial sector is among the most widely affected by the economic crisis occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the most notable effects is related to financial crime. It is against this backdrop that the present study aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 on financial institutions with the main focus being on financial crime Design/methodology/approach: Its twofold objectives were to critically examine the global emerging patterns of financial crime and their association with the COVID-19 pandemic;and to investigate how financial institutions across the world have been responding to, managing, and dealing with the emerging patterns of financial crime brought about by (or linked to) the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: It was found out that as the pandemic ravages the world and pushes people and businesses to the very limits of their endurance, many financial sector stakeholders and players are responding in ways that put the entire financial sector and all its stakeholders at great risk. Specifically, COVID-19 pandemic has led to the emergence of new patterns of financial crime that were either unheard of or were not as rampant in the past.

As various countries went into lockdown, hospitality and tourism was badly affected and this has had an impact on hospitality and tourism education too. This paper aims to assess the impact of the pandemic on hospitality and tourism education in India and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies in support of the industry. The study also proposes recommendations for resilience-building. Design/methodology/approach: A pilot survey using semi-structured interviews was conducted and followed by a detailed questionnaire-based survey of industry representatives and educators. Selected industry leaders were also interviewed to understand the industry perspective on the pandemic, the “new normal” and the expectations of post pandemic graduates. The study focuses on four main areas – (1) existing interrelationships between industry and academia, (2) the efficiency of Internet-based education during the pandemic, (3) the “new normal” and the expectations of graduates and (4) recommendations for resilience-building. Findings: There is a perceived gap between academia and industry that needs to be bridged. We found that the pandemic is seriously affecting education with challenges ranging from technological issues, disparities and reduced enrolments to student behavioural issues. Most impacted was the practical training component in operational areas and especially in food production and services. It is now clear that education needs a shift in focus from the more traditional, operational aspects of hospitality and tourism to technological awareness, knowledge and soft skills development. The research also identified a need for better two-way communication and information exchange between industry and academia. In fact, the lessons learnt from the pandemic need to be communicated from industry to academia. This is important given that industry expects graduates to be adaptive, compassionate, able to multi-task, familiar with the principles of crisis management and proficient with technology. Originality/value: The study analyses possible long-term effects and implications for the workforce of the future as the industry struggles to respond to the pandemic. The study also suggests possible avenues and methods for industry and academia to form more symbiotic relationships and become more resilient. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Joshi, V.

Identifying factors that could help maintain mental health especially social support could be helpful in facing this stressful situation.ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to asses the relationship between the trait-anxiety and perceived social support among Tunisian HCP in the current pandemic wave of COVID-19.MethodsA cross- sectional descriptive and analytic study conducted among Tunisian HCP during November and December 2020. The data were collected by an online questionnaire. The trait-anxiety was assessed using the “General Anxiety questionnaire of Spielberger” (STAI-Y-B). We used the “Social Support Questionnaire” to measure availability and satisfaction regarding perceived social support.ResultsParticipants were 135 HCP, and aged from 24 to 61 years old (average age 31.98 years). The sex ratio was 1.1 (71 males and 64 females). Of HCP involved in the study, 61.5% were single, 36.3% were married and 2.2% were divorced. The average scores of availability and satisfaction regarding perceived social were 7.79 (SD=3.56) and 28.41 (SD=6.75), respectively. Seventy-two of the HCP had a trait-anxious. Analysis showed that social support satisfaction scores were significantly lower in trait-anxious HCP (p<0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the score of availability according to trait-anxiety (p=0.49).ConclusionsOur study highlighted the existence of a deficit on perceived social support satisfaction among trait-anxious Tunisian HCP. Perceived social support as a determinant of trait anxiety should be the focus of social work in this period.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Bouaziz, A.; Smaoui, N.; Kraiem, M.; Bouali, M.

This challenge has been highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, showing how viruses can quickly spread and impact society as a whole. Novel interdisciplinary techniques must emerge to provide forward-looking strategies to combat viral infections, as well as possible future pandemics. In the past decade, an interdisciplinary area involving bioengineering, nanotechnology and information and communication technology (ICT) has been developed, known as Molecular Communications. This new emerging area uses elements of classical communication systems to molecular signalling and communication found inside and outside biological systems, characterizing the signalling processes between cells and viruses. In this paper, we provide an extensive and detailed discussion on how molecular communications can be integrated into the viral infectious diseases research, and how possible treatment and vaccines can be developed considering molecules as information carriers. We provide a literature review on molecular communications models for viral infection (intra-body and extra-body), a deep analysis on their effects on immune response, how experimental can be used by the molecular communications community, as well as open issues and future directions.","Barros, M.

To study disease development, an inventory of an organ’s cell types and understanding of physiologic function is paramount. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing to examine heterogeneity of murine pancreatic duct cells, pancreatobiliary cells, and intrapancreatic bile duct cells. We describe an epithelial-mesenchymal transitory axis in our three pancreatic duct subpopulations and identify SPP1 as a regulator of this fate decision as well as human duct cell de-differentiation. Our results further identify functional heterogeneity within pancreatic duct subpopulations by elucidating a role for Geminin in accumulation of DNA damage in the setting of chronic pancreatitis. Our findings implicate diverse functional roles for subpopulations of pancreatic duct cells in maintenance of duct cell identity and disease progression and establish a comprehensive road map of murine pancreatic duct cell, pancreatobiliary cell, and intrapancreatic bile duct cell homeostasis. SIGNIFICANCE Murine models are extensively used for pancreatic lineage tracing experiments and investigation of pancreatic disease progression. Here, we describe the transcriptome of murine pancreatic duct cells, intrapancreatic bile duct cells, and pancreatobiliary cells at single cell resolution. Our analysis defines novel heterogeneity within the pancreatic ductal tree and supports the paradigm that more than one population of pancreatic duct cells harbors progenitor capacity.

169857,The neurological impact of covid-19,2021,"Formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2), a member of the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), mediates neutrophil migration, a response that has been linked to β-arrestin recruitment. β-Arrestin regulates GPCR endocytosis and can also elicit non-canonical receptor signaling. To determine the poorly understood role of β-arrestin in FPR2 endocytosis and in NADPH-oxidase activation in neutrophils, Barbadin was used as a research tool in this study. Barbadin has been shown to bind the clathrin adaptor protein (AP2) and thereby prevent β- arrestin/AP2 interaction and β-arrestin-mediated GPCR endocytosis. In agreement with this, AP2/β-arrestin interaction induced by an FPR2-specific agonist was inhibited by Barbadin. Unexpectedly, however, Barbadin did not inhibit FPR2 endocytosis, indicating that a mechanism independent of β-arrestin/AP2 interaction may sustain FPR2 endocytosis. This was confirmed by the fact, that FPR2 also underwent agonist-promoted endocytosis in β-arrestin deficient cells, albeit at a diminished level as compared to wild type cells. Dissection of the Barbadin effects on FPR2-mediated neutrophil functions including NADPH-oxidase activation mediated release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and chemotaxis reveled that Barbadin had no effect on chemotactic migration whereas the release of ROS was potentiated/primed. The effect of Barbadin on ROS production was reversible, independent of β-arrestin recruitment, and similar to that induced by latrunculin A. Taken together, our data demonstrate that endocytic uptake of FPR2 occurs independently of β-arrestin, while Barbadin selectively augments FPR2-mediated neutrophil ROS production independently of receptor endocytosis. Given that Barbadin binds to AP2 and prevents the AP2/β-arrestin interaction, our results indicate a role for AP2 in FPR2-mediated ROS release from human neutrophils.","Sundqvist, Martina; Holdfeldt, André; Wright, Shane C.; Møller, Thor C.; Siaw, Esther; Jennbacken, Karin; Franzyk, Henrik; Bouvier, Michel; Dahlgren, Claes; Forsman, Huamei",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.30.070011,571

Various techniques can provide a qualitative survey of which components are found in a given complex. However, quantitative analysis of the absolute number of molecules within a complex (known as stoichiometry) remains challenging. Here we provide a novel method that combines fluorescence microscopy and statistical modelling to derive accurate molecular counts. We have devised a system in which a given biomolecule is differentially labelled with spectrally distinct fluorescent dyes (label A or B), which are then mixed such that B-labelled molecules are vastly outnumbered by those with label A. Complexes, containing this component, are then simply scored as either being positive or negative for label B. The frequency of positive complexes is directly related to the stoichiometry of interaction and molecular counts can be inferred by statistical modelling. We demonstrate this method using complexes of Adenovirus particles and monoclonal antibodies, achieving counts that are in excellent agreement with previous estimates. Beyond virology, this approach is readily transferable to other experimental systems and, therefore, provides a powerful tool for quantitative molecular biology.

In this work, the spread of COVID-19 in Iraq has been studied. Due to the increase in the number of positive cases and deaths with this disease, huge pressure acts on the economy and world professionals worldwide. Therefore, building mathematical models to predict the growth of this serious disease is extremely useful. It helps to predict the future numbers of cases in Iraq. Therefore, dynamic neural networks and curve fitting techniques have been developed to construct such a model. Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) are used as a source for mathematical model construction. The period between 25, February to 18, June 2020 was used for regression, validation, and model construction of Dynamic Neural Networks (DNN). Nine samples (19 – 27 June 2020) were used for predicting the future infected and death cases. Descriptive statistical studies showed that the standard deviation varies sharply on June as compared with earlier months of 2020. Three mathematical models are proposed. Linear, polynomials (2nd, 3rd, and 4th orders), and exponential models are used to correlate confirmed infected cases (CIC) and confirmed death cases (CDC) that represent the dependent variables as function of time (independent variable). Nonlinear regression based on least-square method is used to estimate the coefficients of models. Exponential models were the most significant with 0.9964 and 0.9974 correlation coefficients for CIC and CDC, respectively. Validation analysis showed a significant deviation between real and predicted cases using exponential models. However, DNN models showed better response than exponential models.

This was achieved by coupling farming models to the biogas industry in a partial equilibrium framework. This allows for a comprehensive investigation of alternative measures in technology, size, spatial distribution and land use change. The integrated model was implemented in Lubelskie for the previous policy (green certificates) and the current policy (auction market). In both cases, the bottom-up profit driven optimization resulted in approximately 40 MWel, which shows a robust economic potential more than four times the biogas sector’s actual capacity in the region, also providing the detailed structure of the sector.

In this paper we aim to present a new approach which is based on detecting face in any picture (even with low quality) a detection that can goes to 93%. As a second work we aim to test the ability of this algorithm to identify people while wearing medical masks. In fact, with the spread of Covid-19, people are now obliged to wear medical masks. These masks cover almost 60% of persons faces, this lack of information can prevent the identification of the person or can create some confusions. And To secure images and prevent identity theft we propose an approach that consists of hiding a generated key in each person’s image. This unique key is based on user’s personal information, the key will be verified by Luhn algorithm, which is considered as a widely used algorithm to verify generated IDs. As a third work, we aim to hide the person’s ID in the image using a steganographic algorithm. Our work main objective is to protect pictures and prevent any attempt of creating a fake model of the owners. Therefore, the ID hidden in the picture will be destructed in every attempt of creating a fake image or model. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Nemmaoui, S.; Elhammani, S.","6th International Conference on Business Intelligence, CBI 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-76508-8_19,571

It examines the learning activities which ensure the achievement of education quality during unprecedented online learning. The survey based- questionnaire method was used to elicit students' responses. The numbers of students who participated in the survey are 333. The main section of the questionnaire contains questions about the main online learning activities. The coefficient relation of the p-value is highly correlated when tested using Pearson's r and Spearman's. The score of Cronbach's Alpha is (0.93) which indicates (greater internal consistency) an acceptable level of reliability. The findings positively emphasize the effective influence of online learning on student's academic achievements in most of learning factors except in an assessment factor where the development of new assessment methods is needed.","Mahyoob, Mohammad",International Journal of Information and Communication Technology Education,https://doi.org/10.4018/ijicte.20211001.oa7,571

We rely on a research framework that consists of a “challenge-reaction-learning loop” to empirically investigate how entrepreneurial resilience is built in times of the COVID-19 crisis. To investigate this complex entrepreneurial learning process, we use data that have been collected during the first and second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. By using several datapoints, we could identify (1) the specific challenges growth-oriented firms are facing as a result of the COVID-19 crisis;(2) how these entrepreneurs reacted to these challenges;and (3) what they learned during the first and second wave of the pandemic and how they perceive the future. By making this entrepreneurial learning process explicit and dividing it into an iterative “challenge-reaction-learning loop”, this study is relevant for all entrepreneurs, as it contains several interesting lessons learned. We also contribute to academic literature as we provide future researchers a tangible framework to further elucidate how entrepreneurial resilience is built in times of crisis.","Schepers, Jelle Vandekerkhof Pieter Dillen Yannick",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13169296,571

Recently, using three blood biomarkers, an interpretable machine learning model was developed to predict the mortality of COVID-19 patients. The method was reported to be suffering from performance stability because the identified biomarkers are not consistent predictors over an extended duration. To sustain performance, the proposed method partitioned data into three different time windows. For each window, an end-classifier, a mid-classifier and a front-classifier were designed respectively using the XGboost single tree approach. These time window classifiers were integrated into a majority vote classifier and tested with an isolated test data set. The voting classifier strengthens the overall performance of 90% cumulative accuracy from a 14 days window to a 21 days prediction window. An additional 7 days of prediction window can have a considerable impact on a patient's chance of survival. This study validated the feasibility of the time window voting classifier and further support the selection of biomarkers features set for the early prognosis of patients with a higher risk of mortality.","GOH, T.; Liu, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.02.21259934v1?rss=1,571

Transform the City – It Saves the Climate and Lowers the Risk of Pandemics,2021,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has had an immeasurable impact on the global economy. It has damaged parts of the real economy, but also provided new opportunities for China’s green development. Both the system and foreign direct investment (FDI) have an important impact on China’s green recovery path. Based on the provincial panel data of China from 2007 to 2016, this paper uses a slacks-based measure (SBM) model and Malmquist–Luenberger (ML) index to measure the green total factor productivity (GTFP), and empirically analyzes the regulatory role of system in the influencing mechanism of FDI on GTFP. The results show that the overall level of FDI significantly inhibits the improvement of GTFP, and the interaction between system and FDI makes it shift from inhibition to promotion, but the promotion would be weakened with the improvement of the system. FDI in the eastern region shows a positive effect on GTFP, which will be weakened with the improvement of the system. FDI in central and western regions shows a negative effect on GTFP, and the negative effect in western regions will be increased with the improvement of the system. Then this article puts forward targeted policy suggestions for further improving the level of regional systems and introducing FDI of high quality. © 2021 by the authors.

The global reach of this pandemic, and the immediate need for effective treatments for patients with severe and critical COVID-19, is driving both basic and clinical research at an unprecedented rate. Convalescent plasma therapy is a treatment option that has been known since the 1900s and has been used in various disease treatments since then. Convalescent plasma therapy is one of the treatments currently being used in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. We see that this treatment method was likewise used in the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Ebola epidemics, which occurred worldwide in the recent past.

In this narrative review, searching a number of electronic databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Science Direct), 127 related articles written in English were retrieved and of which 73 articles related to risk factors affecting morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 were extracted and summarized. Factors such as old age, male gender and working in health setting were associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Hypertension was the most frequent reported condition among those with severe disease. It also appeared to increase the mortality and duration of hospitalization. Diabetes, respiratory chronic illnesses (COPD, asthma), impaired liver and renal function, and malignancies were also mentioned as the risk factors for severe disease, longer hospitalization, poor prognosis and outcome. Some laboratory findings such as elevated D-dimer, CRP, and LDH as well as severe lymphopenia were associated with severity, mortality and poor outcomes in hospitalized patients.

173569,EXCESS DEATHS FROM ALL CAUSES AND BY COVID-19 IN BRAZIL IN 2020,2021-08-18,"In many ways, the African world view and African theology are closer to nature than Euro-American theology is. This can be seen, for example, in its emphasis on holism and interconnectedness, and its inclination to consider all natural objects to be inhabited by the spirit world. This article argues that this closeness to nature should not be confused with a Romantic reverence for nature. Since the 19th century, Romanticism has been very influential in the Euro-American idea of nature. Nature came to be seen as something that is both good and valuable in itself. The conception of nature that is dominant in African ways of thinking is very different: nature is seen as potentially threatening and, at best, ambivalent;and respect for nature and living in balance with nature is judged by the extent to which they help humans to live successfully. In this article, a theological and philosophical clarification of these two contrasting conceptions of nature is combined with qualitative anthropological analysis of the way Zambian pastors speak about nature in their sermons. These two approaches together bring out the often-misinterpreted non-Romantic idea of nature in African theology. Contribution: This article clarifies the important idea of nature within the context of African theology. It brings out how the meaning of holism and sacredness in African settings differs from the meaning of these ideas in Western eco-theological contexts. Hereby, it untangles important confusions in the field of eco-theology.","Kroesbergen, Hermen Kroesbergen-Kamps Johanneke",Hervormde Teologiese Studies,https://doi.org/10.4102/hts.v77i3.6624,571

At a tertiary care center, where a majority of the cases are referred from adjoining areas, the incidence of complications encountered was more. The present study discusses the impact of COVID-19 in pregnant females and subsequent perinatal outcomes. Aims: To study the perinatal outcomes in COVID-19-diagnosed pregnancy. Type of study: Observational analytical study. Methodology: All the pregnant females with COVID-19-diagnosed pregnancy were studied for their demographic profile, symptomatology, laboratory results, obstetric outcome, and neonatal performance between June 18, 2020, and September 30, 2020. Results: A total of 114 obstetric patients were admitted at this particular level two-facility center. Out of this, 21 were symptomatic, 22 delivered by cesarean, two cases of ruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy were seen, two cases of ruptured uterus were there, nine cases were received in obstructed labor, four cases of incomplete abortion, and three stillbirths were reported at our center. None of the neonates was tested positive for COVID-19. Oligohydramnios was seen in 25.4% of cases and thrombocytopenia was a significant finding in 33.3% of the patients. Conclusion: COVID-19 has affected the obstetric population with varied outcomes all throughout pregnancy. Even in asymptomatic patients, complications like oligohydramnios and thrombocytopenia were seen. Obstetric services were poorly catered at the periphery as many patients were received in emergency as cases of obstructed labor and ruptured uterus. COVID-19 has negatively affected each dimension of service care provisions and the health and outcome of the obstetric population.","Jamal, S.; Singh, N.",Journal of SAFOG,https://doi.org/10.5005/jp-journals-10006-1874,571

174453,The Service Experiences of Public Libraries during the COVID-19 Emergency in Wuhan: Three Case Studies,2021,"Background One of the main challenges of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is to be able to make sense of available, but often heterogeneous and noisy data, to characterize the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics, with the additional goal of having better preparedness and planning of healthcare services. This contribution presents a data-driven methodology that allows exploring the hospitalization dynamics of COVID-19, exemplified with a study of 17 autonomous regions in Spain. Methods We use data on new daily cases and hospitalizations reported by the Ministry of Health of Spain to implement a Bayesian inference method that allows making short and mid-term predictions of bed occupancy of COVID-19 patients in each of the autonomous regions of the country. Findings We show how to use given and generated temporal series for the number of daily admissions and discharges from hospital to reproduce the hospitalization dynamics of COVID-19 patients. For the case-study of the region of Aragon, we estimate that the probability of being admitted to hospital care upon infection is 0.090 [0.086-0.094], (95% C.I.), with the distribution governing hospital admission yielding a median interval of 3.5 days and an IQR of 7 days. Likewise, the distribution on the length of stay produces estimates of 12 days for the median and 10 days for the IQR. A comparison between model parameters for the regions analyzed allows to detect differences and changes in policies of the health authorities. Interpretation The amount of data that is currently available is limited, and sometimes unreliable, hindering our understanding of many aspects of this pandemic. We have observed important regional differences, signaling that to properly compare very different populations, it is paramount to acknowledge all the diversity in terms of culture, socio-economic status and resource availability. To better understand the impact of this pandemic, much more data, disaggregated and properly annotated, should be made available.","Aleta, A.; Blas-Laina, J.

174711,How COVID-19 information spread in US The Role of Twitter as Early Indicator of Epidemics,2021,"Background: We aimed to assess the specificity of SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection assays among people with known tissue-borne parasitic infections. Methods: We tested three SARS-CoV-2 antibody-detection assays (cPass SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, and STANDARD Q COVID-19 IgM/IgG Combo Rapid Test) among 559 pre-COVID-19 sera. Results: The specificity of assays was 95-98% overall. However, lower specificity was observed among sera from patients with protozoan infections of the reticuloendothelial system, such as human African trypanosomiasis (Abbott Architect; 88% [95%CI 75-95]), visceral leishmaniasis (SD RDT IgG; 80% [95%CI 30-99]), and from patients with recent malaria from a holoendemic area of Senegal (ranging from 91% for Abbott Architect and SD RDT IgM to 98-99% for cPass and SD RDT IgG). For specimens from patients with evidence of past or present helminth infection overall, test specificity estimates were all [≥] 96%. Sera collected from patients clinically suspected of parasitic infections that tested negative for these infections yielded a specificity of 98-100%. The majority (>85%) of false-positive results were positive by only one assay. Conclusions: The specificity of SARS-CoV-2 serological assays among sera from patients with tissue-borne parasitic infections was below the threshold required for decisions about individual patient care. Specificity is markedly increased by the use of confirmatory testing with a second assay. Finally, the SD RDT IgG proved similarly specific to laboratory-based assays and provides an option in low-resource settings when detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG is indicated.","Yansouni, C.

174732,Analyzing the Effectiveness of COVID-19 Lockdown Policies Using the Time-Dependent Reproduction Number and the Regression Discontinuity Framework: Comparison between Countries,2021,"Background Metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) has enabled the rapid, unbiased detection and identification of microbes without pathogen-specific reagents, culturing, or a priori knowledge of the microbial landscape. mNGS data analysis requires a series of computationally intensive processing steps to accurately determine the microbial composition of a sample. Existing mNGS data analysis tools typically require bioinformatics expertise and access to local server-class hardware resources. For many research laboratories, this presents an obstacle, especially in resource limited environments. Findings We present IDseq, an open source cloud-based metagenomics pipeline and service for global pathogen detection and monitoring (https://idseq.net). The IDseq Portal accepts raw mNGS data, performs host and quality filtration steps, then executes an assembly-based alignment pipeline which results in the assignment of reads and contigs to taxonomic categories. The taxonomic relative abundances are reported and visualized in an easy-to-use web application to facilitate data interpretation and hypothesis generation. Furthermore, IDseq supports environmental background model generation and automatic internal spike-in control recognition, providing statistics which are critical for data interpretation. IDseq was designed with the specific intent of detecting novel pathogens. Here, we benchmark novel virus detection capability using both synthetically evolved viral sequences, and real-world samples, including IDseq analysis of a nasopharyngeal swab sample acquired and processed locally in Cambodia from a tourist from Wuhan, China, infected with the recently emergent SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion The IDseq Portal reduces the barrier to entry for mNGS data analysis and enables bench scientists, clinicians, and bioinformaticians to gain insight from mNGS datasets for both known and novel pathogens.","Kalantar, Katrina L.; Carvalho, Tiago; de Bourcy, Charles F.A.; Dimitrov, Boris; Dingle, Greg; Egger, Rebecca; Han, Julie; Holmes, Olivia B.; Juan, Yun-Fang; King, Ryan; Kislyuk, Andrey; Mariano, Maria; Reynoso, Lucia V.; Cruz, David Rissato; Sheu, Jonathan; Tang, Jennifer; Wang, James; Zhang, Mark A.; Zhong, Emily; Ahyong, Vida; Lay, Sreyngim; Chea, Sophana; Bohl, Jennifer A.; Manning, Jessica E.; Tato, Cristina M.; DeRisi, Joseph L.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.030551,571

175168,Implementing the COVID-19 Communications Pathway for Junior Doctors at Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust,2020,"In systemic amyloidosis, Serum amyloid A (SAA) fibril deposits cause widespread damages to tissues and organs that eventually may lead to death. A therapeutically intervention therefore has either to dissolve these fibrils or inhibit their formation. However, only recently has the human SAA fibril structure be resolved at a resolution that is sufficient for development of drug candidates. Here, we use molecular dynamic simulations to probe the factors that modulate the stability of this fibril model. Our simulations suggest that fibril formation starts with the stacking of two misfolded monomers into metastable dimers, with the stacking depending on the N-terminal amyloidogenic regions of different chains forming anchors.

175344,The efficacy of vaccines in the context of COVID-19 and its variants: Role of Spatio-temporal boundary,2021-07-22,"SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2), which surfaced in late 2019 in Wuhan City, China, most likely originated in bats and rapidly spread among humans globally, harming and disrupting livelihoods worldwide. Early into the pandemic, reports of CoV-2 diagnoses in pets and other animals emerged, including dogs, cats, farmed mink, and some large felids (tigers and lions) from various countries. While most CoV-2 positive animals were confirmed to have been in close contact with CoV-2 positive humans, there has been a paucity of published evidence to-date describing risk factors associated with CoV-2 transmission among humans and domestic and wild animals. The COVID-19 Human-Animal Interactions Survey (CHAIS) was developed through a cross-CEIRS Center collaboration to provide a standardized survey describing human-animal interaction during the pandemic and to evaluate behavioral, spatiotemporal, and biological risk factors associated with bi-directional zoonotic transmission of CoV-2 within households and other shared environments. CHAIS measures four broad domains of transmission risk; 1) intensity and risk of infection among human hosts, 2) spatial characteristics of shared environments, 3) behaviors and human-animal interactions, and 4) animal susceptibility to infection and propensity for onward spread. Following the development of CHAIS, with a One Health approach, a multidisciplinary group of experts (n=20) was invited to review and provide feedback on the survey for content validity. Expert feedback was incorporated into two final survey formats- a long-form and an abridged version for which specific core questions addressing zoonotic and reverse zoonotic transmission were identified. Both forms are modularized, with each section having the capacity to serve as independent instruments, allowing researchers to customize the survey based on context and research-specific needs. Further adaptations for studies seeking to investigate other zoonotic pathogens with similar routes of transmission (i.e. respiratory, direct contact) are also possible. The CHAIS instrument is a standardized human-animal interaction survey developed to provide important data on risk factors that guide transmission of CoV-2 from humans to animals, with great utility in capturing information of zoonotic transmission risk factors for CoV-2 and other similar pathogens.","Gass, J.

(Special Section: Pandemics and sustainability.),2020,"Public feeding programs continue to be a major source of nutrition to a large part of the population across the world. Any disruption to food factories that support these activities, like the one during the Covid-19 pandemic, can lead to adverse health outcomes, especially among children. Policymakers and other stakeholders must balance the need for continuing food-factory operations while ensuring the health and safety of workers. This has led to several innovations that leverage advanced technologies like AI and IoT to monitor the health and safety of workers and ensure hygienic operations. However, there are practical challenges in its implementation on a large scale.This paper presents an implementation framework to build resilient food factories for public feeding using a combination of intelligent technologies. The framework is a result of piloting the technology solution at a facility run as part of a large mid-day meal feeding program in India. Using existing resources like CCTV cameras and new technologies like AI and IoT, hygiene and safety compliance anomalies can be detected and reported in a resource-efficient manner. It will guide stakeholders running food factories for public feeding as they seek to restart suspended operations and build systems that better adapt to future crises. © 2021 IEEE.","Kuntagod, N.; Podder, S.; Abbabathula, S.

175948,Sanitizing agri-food tech: COVID-19 and the politics of expectation,2021,"There still are no effective long-term protective vaccines against viruses that continuously evolve under immune pressure such as seasonal influenza, which has caused, and can cause, devastating epidemics in the human population. For finding such a broadly protective immunization strategy it is useful to know how easily the virus can escape via mutation from specific antibody responses. This information is encoded in the fitness landscape of the viral proteins (i.e., knowledge of the viral fitness as a function of sequence). Here we present a computational method to infer the intrinsic mutational fitness landscape of influenza-like evolving antigens from yearly sequence data. We test inference performance with computer-generated sequence data that are based on stochastic simulations mimicking basic features of immune-driven viral evolution. Although the numerically simulated model does create a phylogeny based on the allowed mutations, the inference scheme does not use this information. This provides a contrast to other methods that rely on reconstruction of phylogenetic trees. Our method just needs a sufficient number of samples over multiple years. With our method we are able to infer single-as well as pairwise mutational fitness effects from the simulated sequence time series for short antigenic proteins. Our fitness inference approach may have potential future use for design of immunization protocols by identifying intrinsically vulnerable immune target combinations on antigens that evolve under immune-driven selection. This approach may in the future be applied to influenza and other novel viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, which evolves and, like influenza, might continue to escape the natural and vaccine-mediated immune pressures.","Doelger, Julia; Kardar, Mehran; Chakraborty, Arup K.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.28.454153,571
176092,COVID-19 Air Traffic Visualization: COVID-19 Cases in China Were Likely 37 Times Higher Than Reported in January 2020,2020,"Background: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized, in part, by an excessive inflammatory response. Evidence from animal and human studies suggests that vagus nerve stimulation can lead to reduced levels of various pro-inflammatory cytokines. We conducted a prospective randomized controlled study (SAVIOR-I) to assess the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) for the treatment of respiratory symptoms and inflammatory markers among patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04368156). Methods: Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 allocation to receive either the standard of care (SoC) alone or nVNS therapy plus the SoC. The nVNS group received 2 consecutive 2-minute doses of nVNS 3 times daily as prophylaxis. Efficacy and safety were evaluated via the incidence of specific clinical events, inflammatory biomarker levels, and the occurrence of adverse events. Results: Of the 110 participants who were enrolled and randomly assigned, 97 (nVNS, n=47; SoC, n=50) had sufficient available data and comprised the evaluable population. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels decreased from baseline to a significantly greater degree in the nVNS group than in the SoC group at day 5 and overall (ie, all postbaseline data points collected through day 5, combined). Procalcitonin level also showed significantly greater decreases from baseline to day 5 in the nVNS group than in the SoC group. D-dimer levels were decreased from baseline for the nVNS group and increased from baseline for the SoC group at day 5 and overall, although the difference between the treatment groups did not reach statistical significance. No significant treatment differences were seen for clinical respiratory outcomes or any of the other biochemical markers evaluated. No serious nVNS-related adverse events occurred during the study. Conclusions: nVNS therapy led to significant reductions in levels of inflammatory markers, specifically CRP and procalcitonin. Because nVNS has multiple mechanisms of action that may be relevant to COVID-19, additional research into its potential to be used earlier in the course of COVID-19 and possibly mitigate some of the symptoms associated with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome is warranted.","Tornero, C.; Pastor, E.; Garzando, M. d.

177633,Analysis of Feature Influence on Covid-19 Death Rate Per Country Using a Novel Orthogonalization Technique,2021-07-05,"Background: There are increasing reports of thromboembolic complications in patients with COVID-19 infection. According to a metaanalysis of 28,173 patients, the prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients ranges from 7.9% to 22.7% based on the severity of COVID-19. Cancer and anti-cancer therapies are known risk factors for thrombosis. Another study based on registry data reported the overall prevalence of VTE in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with cancer to be 14.5%. Our study aimed to assess the prevalence of VTE in cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 as well as the association between VTE and cancer in the setting of COVID-19 infection in a large predominantly urban healthcare system. Methods: We utilized a cohort data query tool in the electronic medical record at University Medical Center in New Orleans, Louisiana to identify patients &gt;17 years of age with a hospital or clinic visit in the LCMC Health system between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 which were considered the base population for the study. Cancer patients were identified via the cancer registry tool. Patients with COVID-19 were identified using the abnormal COVID-19 PCR test result search field. An encounter diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) was used to identify patients with VTE. Odds ratios, p-values, and corresponding confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using 2x2 contingency tables. Results: In our database, we identified 3,807 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and 9,560 with a cancer diagnosis. 158,812 patients had neither COVID-19 nor cancer. There were statistically significant greater odds of developing VTE in all subgroups compared: COVID-19 alone vs neither (OR 2.43), cancer alone vs neither (OR 3.8), and COVID-19 and cancer vs neither (OR 10.65). Conclusions: COVID-19 and cancer are both risk factors for VTE. Based on our study, appears that cancer has the greater effect on VTE compared with COVID-19 infection. Also, there is possibly a synergistic effect between COVID-19 and cancer, which further increases the likelihood of VTE. This study is a preliminary analysis. Further investigation is warranted in the form of either variable adjusted analysis of the same data, individual chart review, or a prospective study.","Ananthula, A.; Tran, D.; Thomas, K.; Mc, K.

One of the consequences of this policy is a significant change in electricity consumption patterns. Since load forecasting models rely on calendar or meteorological information and are trained on historical data, they fail to capture the significant break caused by the lockdown and have exhibited poor performances since the beginning of the pandemic. In this paper we introduce two methods to adapt generalized additive models, alleviating the aforementioned issue. Using Kalman filters and fine-tuning allows to adapt quickly to new electricity consumption patterns without requiring exogenous information. The proposed methods are applied to forecast the electricity demand during the French lockdown period, where they demonstrate their ability to significantly reduce prediction errors compared to traditional models. Finally, expert aggregation is used to leverage the specificities of each predictions and enhance results even further.","Obst, David de Vilmarest Joseph Goude Yannig",IEEE Transactions on Power Systems,https://doi.org/10.1109/tpwrs.2021.3067551,571

178696,Elucidating Post-COVID-19 manifestations in India,2021-07-08,"Abstract A cutting anomaly can be detected by using machine learning and pattern recognition in addition to the conventional method of using cutting knowledge to determine the criteria of detection. However, it is difficult to guarantee that all cutting anomalies can be detected during mass production due to various events that can occur. Moreover, machine learning and pattern recognition are not systemized for use in mass production. In this work, we investigated the detection of turning anomalies during mass production under optimized cutting conditions. We applied a method that utilizes the motor current of each operating axis to monitor the machining state without affecting the machining process and determines the correlation between turning anomalies and motor data. Our target was the unsteady anomalies that appear in mass production, such as chip biting and tool vibration. On the basis of the obtained correlation, we developed a formalized anomaly detection method using traditional statistics and a systemized anomaly detection method using discretization and pattern recognition based on the Mahalanobis Taguchi method with auto parameter tuning to eliminate the need for detailed analysis based on knowledge of cutting phenomena. Both methods achieved a detection accuracy of over 98%.","Watanabe, Tsubasa; Kono, Ippei; Onozuka, Hideaki",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S235197892031578X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235197892031578X,571
179076,The COVID-19 Caring Project,2021,"This piece argues that to understand the gendered impact of livelihood loss due to COVID-19, we must examine not only the direct effects on women's earnings but also the indirect effects on intra-household dynamics and vulnerabilities, such as food insecurity, depletion of savings and assets, social isolation, and mobility loss. And these precarities and perils are faced not just by women who have lost paid jobs, but also by women who were unpaid workers on family enterprises which have been crippled. Moreover, women can be affected disproportionately not only by the erosion of their own livelihoods, but also by the loss of male jobs and return migration from cities to villages, leading to occupational crowding, extended domestic work, hunger, and even domestic violence. The success of women-centric groups in states such as Kerala, however, suggests that not all outcomes have been adverse. Drawing on telephone surveys and other emerging evidence on the pandemic in India, this piece examines the direct and indirect effects on women of livelihood losses by both genders, especially in poor households, as well as the lessons offered by women-led group approaches for charting new developmental pathways.","Agarwal, B.",World Development,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105312,571
179264,Forecasting COVID-19 cases and deaths in epidemic-mitigating European countries by Richards function-based regression analyses,,"This project report presents the rationale and the first results as regards the ongoing learning process of the PROMETEUS (PROMotion of EmobiliTy in EU regionS) project, co-financed by the Interreg Europe program, in the context of EU policies and programs dedicated to the promotion of sustainable mobility, and electric mobility in particular. Electric mobility, and in general low-carbon mobility, is one of the main targets of the European Union’s policies dedicated to a green transition. Despite continuous efforts, the number of electric cars in circulation remains low and the objectives of expanding the market for such vehicles by 2030 are still far from being fulfilled. Up until 2018, the share of electric vehicles was in fact only 1.5% of total car sales in the EU. Specifically, it has been noted that an increase in the uptake of electric vehicles in Europe is hampered by the presence of three main barriers: affordability, infrastructure availability, and lack of investments. In this context, project PROMETEUS has aimed at tackling the lacunae in the availability of infrastructures for a transition towards electric mobility in the partnership’s regions, namely, Carinthia in Austria, Castilla y León in Spain, Lazio in Italy, Malta, and Prešov in Slovakia, and at countering low awareness in the public through the improvement of policy instruments linked to structural funds. In order to approach and clarify the process of improvement of those policy instruments, we have summarized and presented the reference results and outputs from the Action Plans across the partners. Moreover, the report discusses in detail the output of the regional Action Plan of the one of project partners—the Prešov region, as the form of a model example—as the initial situation in terms of infrastructure development in the region posing as the biggest challenge for the project. Managerial as well as research summaries can be helpful in the implementation of similar projects;in the continuous improvement of policy instruments;and, last but not least, in the formulation of new challenges to improve awareness of sustainable forms of transport.","Pollák, František Vodák Josef Soviar Jakub Markovič Peter Lentini Gianluca Mazzeschi Valerio Luè Alessandro",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13031545,571
179377,Revisiting the sustainable versus conventional investment dilemma in COVID-19 times,2021,"The COVID-19 outbreak had multiple impacts on our lives. While the overall society has been impacted, teachers and students have not been spared: lockdowns and emergency remote teaching led them to adapt. So that teachers suddenly taught online to transfer knowledge. Besides such an adaptation, one of the challenges has been to keep students motivated and interested to ensure knowledge transfer, even if there were no physical interaction. Human responses are then crucial as answers to these challenges, when individuals are facing such a crisis situation. In this paper, we propose to model teaching mechanisms and how they have been impacted to suddenly go online and ensure knowledge transfer, whether tacit or made-explicit. We focus on the importance of tacit knowledge transfer from the teacher towards the students. Through our proposal we highlight the role of interactions between the teacher and the students and how much informal exchanges are essential to transfer tacit knowledge. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Arduin, P.

CSP has been shown to induce robust CD8+ T cell responses that are capable of eliminating developing parasites in hepatocytes resulting in protective immunity. In this study, we characterised the importance of the immunodominant CSP-derived epitope, SYIPSAEKI, of Plasmodium berghei in both sporozoite- and vaccine-induced protection in murine infection models. In BALB/c mice, where SYIPSAEKI is efficiently presented in the context of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecule H-2-Kd, we established that epitope-specific CD8+ T cell responses contribute to parasite killing following sporozoite immunisation. Yet, sterile protection was achieved in the absence of this epitope substantiating the concept that other antigens can be sufficient for parasite-induced protective immunity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SYIPSAEKI-specific CD8+ T cell responses elicited by viral-vectored CSP-expressing vaccines effectively targeted parasites in hepatocytes. The resulting sterile protection strictly relied on the expression of SYIPSAEKI. In C57BL/6 mice, which are unable to present the immunodominant epitope, CSP-based vaccines did not confer complete protection, despite the induction of high levels of CSP-specific antibodies. These findings underscore the significance of CSP in protection against malaria pre-erythrocytic stages and demonstrate that a significant proportion of the protection against the parasite is mediated by CD8+ T cells specific for the immunodominant CSP-derived epitope.","Gibbins, Matthew P.; Müller, Katja; Glover, Maya; Liu, Jasmine; Putrianti, Elyzana D.; Bauza, Karolis; Reyes-Sandoval, Arturo; Matuschewski, Kai; Silvie, Olivier; Hafalla, Julius Clemence R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.024539,571

A Sample of Job Advertisements in the COVID-19 Period,2021,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly and developed the current pandemic and the stressful lifestyle in addition with extreme pressure on people was the consequence of its increasing mortality rate. Since COVID-19 is highly infectious, it is crucial to diagnose the disease timely and initiate preventive measures to control the epidemic. Therefore, the need for accurate detection of this virus has been increased dramatically. Real-Time reverse-transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR) tests are considered a gold standard to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Besides, the recent pandemic has posed the most serious challenge in PCR applications to date. Although RT-PCR has great accuracy, some factors can reduce the efficiency of this test. Time of testing and type of sample are typical elements that may cause false negative results. Furthermore, false positive cases would be the result of contamination and unoptimized primers. In this paper, the relevant factors creating false positive and false negative results have been investigated in depth to increase the awareness of clinicians. © 2021, Journal of Iranian Medical Council.","Hakimi, S.",Journal of Iranian Medical Council,https://doi.org/10.18502/jimc.v4i2.6465,571

Here, we derive human brain organoids with innately developing microglia to investigate the cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection on a single cell level. We find evidence of limited tropism to SARS-CoV-2 for all major cell types and observe extensive neuronal cell death that also include non-infected cells. Single cell transcriptome profiling reveals distinct responses in microglia and astrocytes that share features with cellular states observed in neurodegenerative diseases, includes upregulation of genes with relevance for synaptic stripping, and suggests altered blood brain barrier integrity. Across all cell types, we observe a global translational shut-down as well as altered carbohydrate metabolism and cellular respiration. Together, our findings provide insights into cellular responses of the resident brain immune cells to SARS-CoV-2 and pinpoint mechanisms that may be of relevance for the neuropathological changes observed in COVID-19 patients.","Samudyata,; Oliveira, Ana Osório; Malwade, Susmita; Rufino de Sousa, Nuno; Goparaju, Sravan K; Orhan, Funda; Steponaviciute, Laura; Sheridan, Steven D; Perlis, Roy H.; Rothfuchs, Antonio; Sellgren, Carl M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.07.451463,571

The results show that, although there are common actions such as the suspension of classes and telework, virtual learning programs – “Aprende en Casa” Mexico and “Educación en Casa” Ecuador – there are also contrasts. Among these, it is evident that education policy decision-making in Ecuador is more decentralized than in Mexico, and that social competencies in Ecuador are oriented to administrative staff, students, families and teachers, while in Mexico, in addition to those mentioned, these also include media and government employees of the Ministry of Public Education.

Although enormous efforts are being made by all continents to find the appropriate solution, the situation remains worrying. This fact is justified on one hand by the millions of cases with the number of deaths exceeding one and half million on a global scale, and on other hand by the successive waves of lockdown in almost all countries. This situation was exacerbated December 2020 with the arrival in England of a new strain of the more transmissible coronavirus. This great challenge facing all the world's health systems requires actors in the medical domain (health agencies, researchers, and pharmaceutical laboratories, the World Health Organization) to draw and gather knowledge to identify the path for effective treatment.

179859,"Cruise Ships, COVID-19, and Port/Flag State Obligations",2021,"The world today is being hit by COVID-19. As opposed to fingerprints and ID cards, facial recognition technology can effectively prevent the spread of viruses in public places because it does not require contact with specific sensors. However, people also need to wear masks when entering public places, and masks will greatly affect the accuracy of facial recognition. Accurately performing facial recognition while people wear masks is a great challenge. In order to solve the problem of low facial recognition accuracy with mask wearers during the COVID-19 epidemic, we propose a masked-face recognition algorithm based on large margin cosine loss (MFCosface). Due to insufficient masked-face data for training, we designed a masked-face image generation algorithm based on the detection of the detection of key facial features. The face is detected and aligned through a multi-task cascaded convolutional network;and then we detect the key features of the face and select the mask template for coverage according to the positional information of the key features. Finally, we generate the corresponding masked-face image. Through analysis of the masked-face images, we found that triplet loss is not applicable to our datasets, because the results of online triplet selection contain fewer mask changes, making it difficult for the model to learn the relationship between mask occlusion and feature mapping. We use a large margin cosine loss as the loss function for training, which can map all the feature samples in a feature space with a smaller intra-class distance and a larger inter-class distance. In order to make the model pay more attention to the area that is not covered by the mask, we designed an Att-inception module that combines the Inception-Resnet module and the convolutional block attention module, which increases the weight of any unoccluded area in the feature map, thereby enlarging the unoccluded area’s contribution to the identification process. Experiments on several masked-face datasets have proved that our algorithm greatly improves the accuracy of masked-face recognition, and can accurately perform facial recognition with masked subjects. © 2021 by the authors.

This study measured the prevention behavior of COVID-19 in West Kalimantan Province, Indonesia by socio-demographic factors and protection motivations from the community. This study used a cross-sectional design which was carried out for two weeks from the end of July to early August. The study involved 385 respondents from 972,635 people in Municipality Pontianak, Municipality Singkawang, and Ketapang Regency, Indonesia. The result showed the majority of the respondent were female (74.3%), in adult age group (61.3%), graduated from university (51.2%), and have a job (64.9%). Multiple logistic regression showed that respondents had no occupation (Adj. OR=1.87, 95% C.I=1.04-3.37), low perception of self-efficacy (Adj. OR=3.44, 95% C.I=1.98-5.95), and low the evaluated cost response (Adj. OR=1.94, 95% C.I=1.20-3.14) were statistically significant having correlation with poor prevention behavior of spreading COVID-19. The results can be utilized for the promotion of protocol of prevention COVID-19, for instance, provide personal protective equipment (PPE) for people with high-risk occupation including health personal, promote the importance of practice prevention behavior, and control the price of basic PPE including mask and ensure all people have an access to have the mask. © 2021, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.

Hispanic individuals had the largest increase in mortality attributed to Covid-19, but Black individuals had the largest increase in all-cause mortality. Exceptionally large increases in mortality from heart disease, diabetes, and external causes of death account for the adverse trend in all-cause mortality within the Black population.

To explore whether representations of a sound’s pitch might derive from this need for compression, we compared discrimination of harmonic and inharmonic sounds across delays. In contrast to inharmonic spectra, harmonic spectra can be summarized, and thus compressed, using their fundamental frequency (f0). Participants heard two sounds and judged which was higher. Despite being comparable for sounds presented back-to-back, discrimination was better for harmonic than inharmonic stimuli when sounds were separated in time, implicating memory representations unique to harmonic sounds. Patterns of individual differences (correlations between thresholds in different conditions) indicated that listeners use different representations depending on the time delay between sounds, directly comparing the spectra of temporally adjacent sounds, but transitioning to comparing f0s across delays. The need to store sound in memory appears to determine reliance on f0-based pitch, and may explain its importance in music, in which listeners must extract relationships between notes separated in time.","McPherson, Malinda J.; McDermott, Josh H.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.07.082511,571
181171,A review on the mobile applications developed for COVID-19: An exploratory analysis,2020-08-20,"INTRODUCTION: Nodal PTCL with T-follicular helper phenotype (PTCL-TFH), which includes angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), is characterized by recurrent mutations affecting epigenetic regulators such as TET2, DNMT3A, IDH2 and RHOA. The association of aberrant DNA methylation with lymphomagenesis provides rationale for clinical application of hypomethylating agents. Azacitidine, an epigenetic modifier which inhibits DNA methyltransferase, has shown clinical activity as a single agent and in combination in R/R PTCL. We report the findings of the first study of oral azacitidine (CC-486) plus CHOP as initial treatment for PTCL (ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT03542266). METHODS: This phase 2 study prioritized enrollment of PTCL-TFH. Subjects received CHOP on day 1 of each cycle for 6 cycles. Priming with oral azacitidine (CC-486) at 300 mg daily was administered for 7 days prior to cycle 1 of CHOP, and for 14 days before CHOP cycles 2-6. Supportive care included mandatory G-CSF. The primary endpoint is CR per 2014 IWG criteria. Secondary endpoints include ORR, safety and survival. Correlative biomarker studies are planned to assess genomic mutations by next-generation-sequencing (NGS), in addition to methylation and transcription profiles. Using a Simon two-stage design comparing an CR of ≥60% with treatment to an unacceptable CR of ≤35% (alpha=10%, power=80%), 9 or more CR out of 17 enrolled patients were required to declare the treatment worthy of further study. RESULTS: From 6/2018 to 3/2020, 21 subjects with previously untreated PTCL were enrolled at 4 centers, and the study met its accrual. At study entry, 17 patients (81%) had PTCL-TFH (16 AITL and 1 TFH), 3 with PTCL-NOS, 1 with ATLL, including 5 (24%) with CD30+ disease. The median age was 66 years (range 22-77), and the M:F ratio was 1.6:1. Nineteen (90%) had stage III/IV disease, 10 (48%) had elevated LDH, 7 (33%) had bone marrow involvement, and 9 (43%) had IPI 3-5. Treatment was generally well tolerated with expected side effects. Grade 3-4 hematologic toxicities included neutropenia (71.4%), thrombocytopenia (9.5%) and anemia (14.3%), with febrile neutropenia uncommon (14.3%). Grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicities included fatigue (14.3%), hyponatremia (14.3%), diarrhea (4.8%), vomiting (4.8%), rash (4.8%), and elevated ALT (4.8%). One incidence each of influenza A, COVID-19 pneumonia, C.diff and strongyloides hyperinfection were observed and treated. There was no study treatment-related mortality to date. As of July 2020 at a median follow-up of 7 months (range 4-25 months), one subject withdrew consent after cycle 1 (patient preference), and 20 subjects had at least one response assessment, including 15 completed treatment, 2 progressed during treatment, and 3 nearing completion of therapy. At interim assessment after cycle 3 (n=20), the ORR was 85% with CR at 55% (90%CI of 34.7%-74.1%). To date, the preliminary end-of-treatment (EOT, n=17) CR was 76.5% (90%CI of 53.9%-91.5%) for all evaluable patients and was 86.7% for 15 PTCL-TFH, exceeding primary endpoint threshold. CR did not correlate with CD30 expression. The estimated 1-yr PFS for all patients was 56.8% (95%CI of 26.3%-87.3%), with 1-yrs PFS for PTCL-TFH at 61.1% (95%CI of 29.5%-92.7%), and the estimated 1-yr OS for all patients was 74.4% (95%CI of 48.8%-100.0%), with 1-yr OS for PTCL-TFH at 88.9% (95%CI of 68.4%-100.0%). Mutational status by NGS was determined in 15 patients to date. The frequencies of the TET2, RHOA, DNMT3A, and IDH2 mutations were 73%, 40%, 13% and 13%, respectively. TET2 mutations were significantly associated with CR (p=0.014), favorable PFS (p-0.012) and OS (p=0.042). In contrast, DNMT3A mutations were associated with adverse OS (p=0.028). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first demonstration that addition of hypomethylating agent oral azacitidine (CC486) to CHOP as initial therapy is feasible, safe, and induces high CR rate in PTCL-TFH subtype, with expected side effects. Although preliminary, the EOT CR to date exceeds the threshold of meeting study primary endpoint. Final efficacy data as well as response according to subtype and mutational profiling will be updated at ASH. This active combination will be further evaluated in the upcoming ALLIANCE/Intergroup randomized study A051902, comparing oral azacitidine-CHO(E)P with duvelisib-CHO(E)P against CHO(E)P in CD30 negative PTCL.

Most STIs are asymptomatic and people infected wont know to seek care unless they are told about their exposure. Contact tracing, is the process of identifying and contacting sex partners of people with STIs for testing and treatment. Contact tracing is sometimes particularly challenging amongst GBMSM because of the kinds of sexual relationships which GBMSM enjoy. These include one-off partners who are particularly important for transmission dynamics as they contribute disproportionately to onwards transmission. The effectiveness of contact tracing interventions within sexual health are patterned by sexual-partner type. Contact tracing and management for one-off partners is an on-going public health challenge. Low motivation amongst index patients, high resource burden on health care professionals and problems with contactability are key barriers to contact tracing. Using insights from complex adaptive systems thinking and behavioural science, we sought to develop an intervention which addressed both the upstream and down-stream determinants of contact tracing and change the system in which many inter-dependent contact tracing behaviours are embedded. Setting UK community-recruited GBMSM, stakeholders, sexual hcp, dating app providers Method Using the MRC complex intervention framework and insights from the INDEX study, a three-phase intervention development process was adopted to specify intervention content. Phase one consisted of an inter-professional and community-member stakeholder event (n=45) where small mixed groups engaged in exploratory systems-mapping and the identification of hot spots for future intervention. Phase two used a series of focus groups with GBMSM (n=28) and interviews with representatives from key dating app providers (DAPs) (n=3) to further develop intervention ideas using the theoretical domains framework, the behaviour change wheel and the behaviour change technique taxonomy. In Phase 3 we again worked with key stakeholders expert health care professionals (HCPs) (n=5) and key workers from community-based organisations (CBOs) (n=6) to hone the intervention ideas and develop programme theory using the APEASE criteria. Results The co-produced intervention levers change simultaneously across the system within which contact tracing is embedded. Multiple change-agents (i.e., GBMSM, CBOs, HCPs) work together, sharing an overall vision to improve sexual health through contact tracing. Each make relatively modest changes that over time, synergistically combine to produce a range of multiple positively-reinforcing feedback loops to engender sustainable change around contact tracing. Agreed intervention elements included: a co-ordinated, co-produced mass and social media intervention to tip cultural norms and beliefs of GBMSM towards enabling more contact tracing and to challenge enduring STI- and sex-related stigmas; complementary CBO-co-ordinated, peer-led work to also focus on reducing STI stigma and enabling more contact tracing between one-off partners; priming GBMSM at the point of STI diagnosis to prepare for contact tracing interactions and reduce HCP and sexual health-service burden; changes to SHS environments and HCP-led interactions to systematically endorse contact tracing; changing national audits and monitoring systems to directly address one-off partner targets; delivering bespoke training to HCPs and CBO staff on one-off partners and the social and cultural context of GBMSM; DAPs active involvement in mass and social media promoting appropriate contact tracing messaging. Conclusion Our combination of multiple data sources, theoretical perspectives and diverse stakeholders have enabled us to develop an expansive, complex intervention that is firmly based in the priorities of those it will affect, and which has a solid theoretical foundation. Future work will assess if and how it will be possible to evaluate it. The resulting intervention is profoundly different than other ways of enhancing contact tracing, as it simultaneously addresses multiple, multi-levelled, upstream and social determinants of contact tracing.","Flowers, P.; Lasoye, S.; McQueen, J.; Woode Owusu, M.; Symonds, M.; Estcourt, C.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.07.21260064v1?rss=1,571

This human coronavirus has seven strains and they commonly produce illness in the nervous system, respiratory system and hepato- intestinal systems. This present review is an attempt to illustrate recent reports pertaining to the management of SARS-CoV-2. Further, it also highlights the diagnosis and clinical management of COVID-19. Various search engines like Scopus, Pubmed and WHO databases were accessed and literature on current advances about COVID-19 including structural features, replication, possible pathogenic, symptoms, diagnosis, prognosis, methods of prevention and possible therapeutic agents used for treatment of patients was reviewed. Current studies indicate that COVID-19 is very infectious with droplet transmission potential. The key modalities to prevent the infection is by keeping social distancing, respiratory/hand hygiene, detection of infection and subsequent quarantine of the infected persons. Presently, either no vaccine for prevention or specific treatments available, however, COVID-19 patients may be managed by using some repositioned drugs and symptomatic treatment. © 2021 Pharma Book Syndicate.

This meta-analytic review aimed to estimate the pooled uptake of cervical cancer screening uptake and identify its predictors in Sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, African Journals Online, Web of Science and SCOPUS electronic databases were searched. All observational studies conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa and published in English language from January 2000 to 2019 were included. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was applied to examine methodological quality of the studies. Inverse variance-weighted random-effects model meta-analysis was done to estimate the pooled uptake and odds ratio of predictors with 95% confidence interval. I2 test statistic was used to check between-study heterogeneity, and funnel plot and Egger regression statistical test were used to check publication bias. To examine the source of heterogeneity, subgroup analysis based on sample size, publication year and geographic distribution of the studies was carried out. Results: Of 3,537 studies identified, 29 studies were included with 36,374 women. The uptake of cervical cancer screening in Sub-Saharan Africa was 12.87% (95% CI: 10.20, 15.54; I2= 98.5%). Meta-analysis of seven studies showed that knowledge about cervical cancer increased screening uptake by nearly 5-folds (OR: 4.81; 95% CI: 3.06, 7.54). Other predictors include educational status, age, HIV status, contraceptive use, perceived susceptibility, and awareness about screening locations. Conclusion: Cervical screening uptake is low in Sub-Saharan Africa and influenced by several factors. Health outreach and promotion targeting identified predictors are needed to increase uptake of screening service in the region.

I argue that an alternative hypothesis could be that people who downplay the epidemiological threat and do not take precautionary measures suffer from exponential-growth bias.

The two species are widespread in the Neotropical Region, have not been recorded from any other oceanic island, and have most likely been introduced accidentally in the archipelago. Tabanus occidentalis dominated the samples, encompassing 99.6% of the specimens collected in the two local seasons, rainy and dry. Tabanus pungens was rarer, encompassing 0.4% of the specimens collected mainly in the dry season. The tabanids of Fernando de Noronha are able to transmit blood pathogens, bringing risks to the health of the livestock. They also pester the tourists, which brings losses to the local tourist industry. Larvae of both species were already collected in the water lettuce Pistia stratiotes Linnaeus and it is highly recommend that this introduced aquatic plant be removed from the ponds of Fernando de Noronha to control tabanid populations.","Rafael, José Albertino; Marques, Dayse Willkenia Almeida; Silva-Neto, Alberto Moreira; Limeira-de-Oliveira, Francisco","Biota Neotrop.

Source isolation is one of the strategies that have used in order to prevent from the spread of contagious infectious diseases. Since nursing student should be able to do the caring in source isolation patients after learning the principles, it's necessary to assess the students’ perception of caring for this client group in order to prepare them for the role of caring. METHODS: This is a qualitative phenomenological study; its participants were selected with maximum variation by purposed sampling from first to fourth year nursing and midwifery students of Isfahan School of Nursing and Midwifery. The students used to do the patient caring during the clinical internship. The sampling done until 10 interview data saturation was obtained. In order to collect data, researcher used depth interview method. Data analysis was performed by seven-stage Collaizzi method. RESULTS: The findings of this study included 6 main concept (themes) from participants’ experiences as following: 1. Stressor agents of caring, 2. Response to stress, 3. Care requirments, 4. Care provider performance, 5. Consequence of care, and 6. Improper caring. CONCLUSIONS: Providing educational programs in terms of isolated patients can reduce anxiety in students which this can lead to more control and prevent the spread of infectious diseases. In addition, studying about patients’ needs can be useful for improving practical interventions and clinical care.","Dehkordi, Leila Mardanian; Tavakol, Khosrow",Iran J Nurs Midwifery Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3203293/,571

METHODS A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1 designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilised. It was seeded with New Zealand population data and relevant parameters sourced from the New Zealand and international literature. RESULTS For what we regard as the most plausible scenario with an effective reproduction number of 2.0, the results suggest that 95% of outbreaks from a single imported case would be detected in the period up to day 36 after introduction. At the time point of detection, there would be a median number of five infected cases in the community (95% range: 1-29). To achieve this level of detection, an ongoing programme of 5,580 tests per day (1,120 tests per million people per day) for the New Zealand population would be required. The vast majority of this testing (96%) would be of symptomatic cases in primary care settings and the rest in hospitals. CONCLUSIONS This model-based analysis suggests that a surveillance system with a very high level of routine testing is probably required to detect an emerging or re-emerging SARS-CoV-2 outbreak within five weeks of a border control failure in a nation that had previously eliminated COVID-19. Nevertheless, there are plausible strategies to enhance testing yield and cost-effectiveness and potential supplementary surveillance systems such as the testing of town/city sewerage systems for the pandemic virus.","Wilson, Nick; Schwehm, Markus; Verrall, Ayesha J; Parry, Matthew; Baker, Michael G; Eichner, Martin",The New Zealand medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33119568/,571

The proliferation of prostate cancer cells is testosterone-driven, but clonal selection during androgen deprivation therapy promotes the development of androgen-independent (hormone-refractory) cells, which become phenotypically dominant. Human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) is capable of activating the androgen receptor pathway, even in the absence of the ligand. The detection of phenotypic changes associated with the development of androgen independence may influence patient management, suggesting the initiation of a second-line therapy. This study aimed to establish the level of HER2 expression in a number of prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC3 and DU145) in order that they be used as models in further studies, and to evaluate the binding and cellular processing of [(111)In]-labeled trastuzumab and the anti-HER2 synthetic Affibody molecule ABY-025 in these cell lines. The expression of HER2 was demonstrated and quantified in all three tested prostate cancer cell-lines. Studies on cellular processing demonstrated that internalization of both conjugates increased continuously during the whole incubation. The internalization rate was approximately equal for both monoclonal antibodies and Affibody molecules. In both cases, internalization was moderately rapid. Such features would definitely favor the use of radiometal labels for trastuzumab and, most likely, for affibody molecules. The level of HER2 expression in these cell lines is sufficient for in vivo molecular imaging.","Malmberg, Jennie; Tolmachev, Vladimir; Orlova, Anna",Experimental and therapeutic medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22977535/,571

The aims of the present study were to assess the outcomes of LSG on weight loss and obesity associated metabolic complications at six months following intervention. PATIENTS AND METHODS This was a retrospective study on 124 consecutive obese patients (29.8% men), who had undergone LSG between 01/01/2008 and 12/31/2010, in a highly specialized clinic. The dynamic of anthropometric and biochemical data between baseline and six months following LSG were evaluated. We also determined the change in MetS prevalence and used logistic regression to estimate predictors of MetS remission RESULTS 6 months after LSG, the body mass index (BMI) decreased from 46.84 +/- 8.62 to 33.81 +/- 7.04 kg/m2 (p < 0.001). Mean excess BMI loss (EBL) was 65.24 +/- 25.16%. The best results on weight loss were observed in young patients, not affected by MetS, with lower initial BMI. Lipids profile suffered a significant improvement (HDL cholesterol increased, while LDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides decreased, p < 0.05 for each). HOMA-IR values decreased by 75.2%, from 5.24 +/- 4.49 to 1.30 +/- 1.22 (p < 0.001). MetS prevalence was reduced from 74.3% to 18.4% (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, % EBL remained the only significant predictor of MetS remission, the risk for lack of a MetS remission being practically 3 times higher in patients with EBL < 50%, compared to those with EBL > 50% (OR: 2.97, CI: 1.1-10.23, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS As early as 6 months after LSG we recorded a significant weight loss and improvement in insulin resistance and lipids metabolism, as well as an impressive reduction in metabolic syndrome prevalence.","Sirbu, A; Copăescu, C; Martin, S; Barbu, C; Olaru, R; Fica, S",Chirurgia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23025113/,571

RT6 may have immunoregulatory properties based in part on the observation that injection of diabetes-resistant (DR)-BB rats with depleting doses of anti-RT6.1 mAb induced autoimmune diabetes and thyroiditis. We now report that injection of DR-BB rats with anti-RT6.1 mAb increased plasma NADase activity, which localized, by fluid phase liquid chromatography fractionation, to the high density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction. Following ultracentrifugation in high salt, however, RT6 was found in the nonlipoprotein fraction, where it existed, under nondenaturing conditions, as a 200-kDa complex and, by SDS-PAGE, as a 30- to 36-kDa species. Thy-1, another GPI-linked protein, and proteins that reacted with anti-GPI-oligosaccharide Abs also translocated from HDL to the nonlipoprotein fraction under similar conditions. Injection of anti-RT6.1 mAb into thymectomized DR and diabetes-prone-BB rats increased soluble RT6 to levels comparable to those observed in euthymic DR-BB rats, suggesting that HDL-bound RT6 is not derived from peripheral lymphocytes. In agreement, NADase activity in the plasma of eviscerated DR-BB rats did not increase following injection of anti-RT6 mAb. These data suggest that HDL is a carrier of plasma RT6 and other GPI-linked proteins, with equilibrium between the lipoprotein and nonlipoprotein fractions being salt dependent. Since GPI-linked proteins in HDL can transfer to cells in a functionally active form, the presence of RT6 in HDL is consistent with it having a role in signaling in nonlymphoid cells.","Lesma, E; Moss, J; Brewer, H B; Bortell, R; Greiner, D; Mordes, J; Rossini, A A",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9686581/,571

METHOD This cross-sectional study focused on suspected cases of H1N1 reported to the 20th Santa Catarina State Health Administration during the 2009 pandemic between July to September. Data were collected by epidemiological surveillance officers from the Brazilian communicable diseases information system SINAN. H1N1 cases were confirmed by laboratory testing (positive RT-PCR) or signs and symptoms characteristic of severe acute respiratory syndrome. RESULTS During the pandemic period, 1 149 suspected cases of influenza A were notified, of which 560 (48.6%) were confirmed. That translated into an incidence of 241.9/100 000 population. Mean age for confirmed cases was 29.5 ± 17.1 years, vs. 32.2 ± 20 years for those ruled out (P = 0.03). Of the total confirmed cases, 37.1% were hospitalized, with a hospital incidence rate of 89.9/100 000 people and lethality rate of 5.6/100 000 population. Age < 30 years, symptoms of fever, cough and dyspnea, and death were independently associated with influenza A infection (P < 0.05). There were no associations between confirmed cases and any comorbidities. CONCLUSION The studied sample differed from the national profile of influenza A cases in Brazil by the absence of associated comorbidities. However, it was similar to the national profile in terms of the young age of cases and the significant association with fever, cough, and dyspnea. An extension of the annual immunization campaign (currently focused on risk groups) to the overall population should be considered.","Schuelter-Trevisol, Fabiana; Dutra, Marina Constante; Uliano, Estevão José Muller; Zandomênico, Janete; Trevisol, Daisson José",Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22910730/,571

As all the organisms are GC-rich, the GC contents at third codon positions were found in fact higher than the second codon positions as well as the first + second codon positions in all the organisms indicating that directional mutational pressure is strongly operative at the synonymous third codon positions. Nc plot indicates that codon usage variation in all these organisms are governed by the forces other than compositional constraints. Correspondence analysis suggests that: (i) there are codon usage variation among the genes and genomes of the fourteen mycobacteriophages and M. smegmatis, i.e., codon usage patterns in the mycobacteriophages is phage-specific but not the M. smegmatis-specific; (ii) synonymous codon usage patterns of Barnyard, Che8, Che9d, and Omega are more similar than the rest mycobacteriophages and M. smegmatis; (iii) codon usage bias in the mycobacteriophages are mainly determined by mutational pressure; and (iv) the genes of comparatively GC rich genomes are more biased than the GC poor genomes. Translational selection in determining the codon usage variation in highly expressed genes can be invoked from the predominant occurrences of C ending codons in the highly expressed genes. Cluster analysis based on codon usage data also shows that there are two distinct branches for the fourteen mycobacteriophages and there is codon usage variation even among the phages of each branch.","Sahu, K; Gupta, S K; Sau, S; Ghosh, T C",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15918677/,571

This study was performed to investigate astrocytic guidance of growth derived from dopaminergic neurons using organotypic cultures of rat fetal ventral mesencephalon. Primary cultures were studied at different time points starting from 3 days up to 28 days. Cultures were treated with either interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), which has stimulating effects on astrocytic proliferation, or the astrocytic inhibitor cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C). Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunohistochemistry was used to visualize dopaminergic neurons, and antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and S100 beta were used to label astrocytes. The results revealed that a robust TH-positive nerve fiber production was seen already at 3 days in vitro. These neurites had disappeared by 5 days. This early nerve fiber outgrowth was not guided by direct interactions with glial cells. Later, at 7 days in vitro, a second wave of TH-positive neuritic outgrowth was clearly observed. GFAP-positive astrocytic processes guided these neurites. TH-positive neurites arborized overlying S100 beta-positive astrocytes in an area distal to the GFAP-positive astrocytic processes. Treatment with IL-1 beta resulted in an increased area of TH-positive nerve fiber network. In cultures treated with Ara-C, neither astrocytes nor outgrowth of dopaminergic neurites were observed. In conclusion, this study shows that astrocytes play a major role in long-term dopaminergic outgrowth, both in axonal elongation and branching of neurites. The long-term nerve fiber growth is preceded by an early transient outgrowth of dopamine neurites.","Johansson, Saga; Strömberg, Ingrid",The Journal of comparative neurology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11807834/,571

In March 2020 the WHO announced that the epidemic could be characterized as a pandemic. Subsequently, the WHO acknowledged the importance of providing support to the medical teams, realizing the enormous burden and stress facing this group. The aim of the present study is to review the up-to-date professional literature dealing with the psychological impact of a pandemic outbreak on medical staff. The literature existing so-far is scarce. It does, however, provide evidence of the short- and long-term impact of such epidemics on the mental health of the medical teams. Direct exposure to affected patients, the risk of contagion, a subjectively negative perception of one's medical condition and being in isolation or quarantine, all constitute risk factors for mental symptoms such as depression, anxiety and post-trauma. A sense of control, especially regarding the means of protection and controlling infection, altruistic acceptance of the work-related risks, social support, good team-spirit in the medical unit and support from superiors are all protective factors.","Shelef, Leah; Schiff, Miriam; Zalsman, Gil",Harefuah,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32431120/,571

This fragment encompassed all of the genes encoding the structural proteins of the virus. Viral RNA was extracted either directly from tissues of diseased birds or from virus propagated in embryonated eggs, and was subjected to RT-PCR. Three different restriction endonucleases, AluI, Sau3AI and MnlI, were used to digest the 7.5 kb PCR product from different IBV strains and the resultant RFLP patterns were compared. Patterns obtained with all three enzymes grouped IBV strains belonging to the same serotype in the same cluster.

Background: Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 in pediatric patients have been reported in the acute and post-infectious stages of the disease. ADEM typically presents in children following a viral illness at a mean age of 3-7 years. 60-90% of literature reported pediatric patients with ADEM have minimal to no neurologic deficits at long-term follow-up. Design/Methods: A 17-month-old developmentally typical girl presented to our northeast Florida children's hospital with lethargy and inability to move bilateral upper extremities. Thirteen days before admission, she developed 5 days of fever and URI symptoms. On presentation, she was afebrile with notable irritability. The initial neurological exam was significant for left upper extremity rigidity, right upper extremity paresis, lower extremity hyperreflexia, truncal ataxia, and gait instability. Pertinent negatives include no cranial nerve findings or overt sensory deficits. During her hospital course, she became more somnolent for which she was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. Results: MRI brain with and without contrast revealed diffuse patchy T2 hyperintensities without evidence of contrast enhancement. MRI total spine with and without contrast was normal. SARS-CoV-2 nasal swab and antibody testing were positive. CSF analysis was unremarkable (WBC 5, RBC 1, glucose 58, protein 17, and oligoclonal bands 0). Respiratory viral panels, autoimmune encephalitis, and demyelinating disorders panel were negative. She was started on high dose steroids and IVIg with improvement in mental status with the ability to ambulate with minimal assistance. Following hospital discharge, she received inpatient rehab for 2 weeks. Conclusions: Here, we report one of the first cases of post-COVID-19 ADEM in pediatric patients and the youngest to date.

Policy Options and Implications: This policy review analyzes selected articles by the PubMed searcher about extreme measures taken in several countries during precedent pandemics and the current pandemic, and selects hard decisions relating to the exceptional measures taken by judicial departments in Brazil, connecting them to the ""collision of fundamental rights and law principles."" The collision of rights and principles imposed on decision makers a duty to provide balanced rights, and to adopt the enforcement of some rights prioritization. Ethical concerns were also verified in this field involving rights limitations. During a pandemic, the importance of extreme measures to protect health rights and healthcare systems is instrumental for focused, fast, and correct decision making to avoid loss of life and the collapse of healthcare systems. The main goals of this research are to discuss the implications and guidelines for public health decision making, the indispensable ethical and legal aspects for safeguarding health systems and the lives of people, and the respect of the Justice principle and of fundamental health and dignity rights. We conclude that COVID-19 justifies the prioritization of collective and individual health access rights. Acceptable standards of fundamental rights restrictions are established at the constitutional and international levels and must be enforced by rules and governmental action, to ensure fast and accurate decision making during a pandemic. Freedom rights exercises must be linked to solidarity for the realization of social welfare, for the health rights of all individuals and for health systems to function well during a pandemic. Actionable Recommendations: All individuals are free and equal, therefore social exclusion is prohibited. Institutions must consider social inequalities when discussing public health measures and be guided by ethical standards, by law principles, and rules recognized by constitutional and international law for the benefit of all during a health pandemic. Conclusions: Collective and individual health rights prevail over the collision of rights when facing pandemic occurrences, case by case, in health systems protection, based on the literature, on precedent pandemics and on legitimate Public Health efforts.","Dos Santos, José Luiz Gondim; Stein Messetti, Paulo André; Adami, Fernando; Bezerra, Italla Maria Pinheiro; Maia, Paula Christianne G G Souto; Tristan-Cheever, Elisa; de Abreu, Luiz Carlos",Front Public Health,,571
204583,Apolipoprotein E4 Allele in Subjects with COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV2 virus could be potentially myopathic. Serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) is frequently found elevated in severe SARS-CoV2 infection, which indicates skeletal muscle damage precipitating limb weakness or even ventilatory failure. CASE PRESENTATION: We addressed such a patient in his forties presented with features of severe SARS-CoV2 pneumonia and high serum CPK. He developed severe sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and received intravenous high dose corticosteroid and tocilizumab to counter SARS-CoV2 associated cytokine surge. After 10 days of mechanical ventilation (MV), weaning was unsuccessful albeit apparently clear lung fields, having additionally severe and symmetric limb muscle weakness. Ancillary investigations in addition with serum CPK, including electromyogram, muscle biopsy, and muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested acute myopathy possibly due to skeletal myositis. CONCLUSION: We wish to stress that myopathogenic medication in SARS-CoV2 pneumonia should be used with caution. Additionally, serum CPK could be a potential marker to predict respiratory failure in SARS-CoV2 pneumonia as skeletal myopathy affecting chest muscles may contribute ventilatory failure on top of oxygenation failure due to SARS-CoV2 pneumonia.","Islam, Badrul; Ahmed, Mohiuddin; Islam, Zhahirul; Begum, S M",Skelet Muscle,,571

204897,Sociodemographic determinants of COVID-19 incidence rates in Oman: Geospatial modelling using multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR),2020,"Recently, companies such as Apple Inc, Fitbit Inc, and Garmin Ltd have released new wearable blood oxygenation measurement technologies. Although the release of these technologies has great potential for generating health-related information, it is important to acknowledge the repercussions of consumer-targeted biometric monitoring technologies (BioMeTs), which in practice, are often used for medical decision making. BioMeTs are bodily connected digital medicine products that process data captured by mobile sensors that use algorithms to generate measures of behavioral and physiological function. These BioMeTs span both general wellness products and medical devices, and consumer-targeted BioMeTs intended for general wellness purposes are not required to undergo a standardized and transparent evaluation process for ensuring their quality and accuracy. The combination of product functionality, marketing, and the circumstances of the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have inevitably led to the use of consumer-targeted BioMeTs for reporting health-related measurements to drive medical decision making. In this viewpoint, we urge consumer-targeted BioMeT manufacturers to go beyond the bare minimum requirements described in US Food and Drug Administration guidance when releasing information on wellness BioMeTs. We also explore new methods and incentive systems that may result in a clearer public understanding of the performance and intended use of consumer-targeted BioMeTs.","Bent, Brinnae; Dunn, Jessilyn P",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,571

Viral infections during pregnancy can disrupt immunological tolerance and may generate deleterious effects on the fetus. Despite these possible links between pregnancy and infection-induced morbidity, it is unclear how pregnancy interferes with maternal response to some viral pathogens. In this context, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) can induce the coronavirus diseases-2019 (COVID-19) in pregnant women. The potential risk of vertical transmission is unclear, babies born from COVID-19-positive mothers seems to have no serious clinical symptoms, the possible mechanisms are discussed, which highlights that checking the children's outcome and more research is warranted. In this review, we investigate the reports concerning viral infections and COVID-19 during pregnancy, to establish a correlation and possible implications of COVID-19 during pregnancy and neonatal's health.","Alberca, Ricardo Wesley; Pereira, Nátalli Zanete; Oliveira, Luanda Mara Da Silva; Gozzi-Silva, Sarah Cristina; Sato, Maria Notomi",Front Immunol,,571

205590,Consequences of covid-19 on the childhood obesity epidemic,2021,"We study mechanisms for reopening economic activities that explore the trade off between containing the spread of COVID-19 and maximizing economic impact. This is of current importance as many organizations, cities, and states are formulating reopening strategies. Our mechanisms, referred to as group scheduling, are based on partitioning the population into groups and scheduling each group on appropriate days with possible gaps (when all are quarantined). Each group interacts with no other group and, importantly, any person who is symptomatic in a group is quarantined. Specifically, our mechanisms are characterized by three parameters $(g,d,t)$, where $g$ is the number of groups, $d$ is the number of days a group is continuously scheduled, and $t$ is the gap between cycles. We show that our mechanisms effectively trade off economic activity for more effective control of the COVID-19 virus. In particular, we show that the $(2,5,0)$ mechanism, which partitions the population into two groups that alternatively work for five days each, flat lines the number of COVID-19 cases quite effectively, while still maintaining economic activity at 70% of pre-COVID-19 level. We also study mechanisms such as $(2,3,2)$ and $(3,3,0)$ that achieve a somewhat lower economic output (about 50%) at the cost of more aggressive control of the virus; these could be applicable in situations when the disease spread is more rampant in the population. We demonstrate the efficacy of our mechanisms by theoretical analysis and extensive experimental simulations on various epidemiological models. Our mechanisms prove beneficial just by regulating human interactions. Moreover, our results show that if the disease transmission (reproductive) rate is made lower by following social distancing, mask wearing, and other public health guidelines, it can further increase the efficacy of our mechanisms.","Augustine, John; Hourani, Khalid; Molla, Anisur Rahaman; Pandurangan, Gopal; Pasic, Adi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08872v1.pdf,571

206744,Challenges and Changes of Pharmacy Practice During the COVID-19 Crisis in Malaysia: Instability as an Opportunity,2021,"BackgroundMost countries initially deployed COVID-19 vaccines preferentially in elderly populations. Population-level vaccine effectiveness may be heralded by an increase in the proportion of deaths among non-elderly populations that were less covered by vaccination programs. MethodsWe collected data from 40 countries on age-stratified COVID-19 deaths during the vaccination period (1/14/2021-5/31/2021) and two control periods (entire pre-vaccination period and excluding the first wave). We meta-analyzed the proportion of deaths in different age groups in vaccination versus control periods in countries with low vaccination rates; (2) countries with age-independent vaccination policies; and (3) countries with standard age-dependent vaccination policies. FindingsCountries that prioritized vaccination among older people saw an increasing share of deaths among 0-69 year old people in the vaccination versus the two control periods (summary prevalence ratio 1{middle dot}32 [95 CI% 1{middle dot}24-1{middle dot}41] and 1{middle dot}35 [95 CI% 1{middle dot}26-1{middle dot}44)]. No such change was seen on average in countries with age-independent vaccination policies (1{middle dot}05 [95 CI% 0{middle dot}78-1{middle dot}41 and 0{middle dot}97 [95 CI% 0{middle dot}95-1{middle dot}00], respectively) and limited vaccination (0{middle dot}93 [95 CI% 0{middle dot}85-1{middle dot}01] and 0{middle dot}95 [95 CI% 0{middle dot}87-1{middle dot}03], respectively). Prevalence ratios were associated with the difference of vaccination rates in elderly versus non-elderly people. No significant changes occurred in the share of deaths in age 0-49 among all 0-69 deaths in the vaccination versus pre-vaccination periods. InterpretationThe substantial shift in the age distribution of COVID-19 deaths in countries that rapidly implemented vaccination predominantly among elderly may herald the population level-effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination and a favorable evolution of the pandemic towards endemicity with fewer elderly deaths.

207071,"'Constituent Covid-19 apocalypses: contagious conspiracism, 5G, and viral vaccinations'",2020,"Pandemic curves, such as COVID-19, often show multiple and unpredictable contamination peaks, often called second, third and fourth waves, which are separated by wide plateaus. Here, by considering the statistical inhomogeneity of age groups, we show a quantitative understanding of the different behaviour rules to flatten a pandemic COVID-19 curve and concomitant multi-peak recurrence. The simulations are based on the Verhulst model with analytical generalized logistic equations for the limited growth. From the log–lin plot, we observe an early exponential growth proportional to et/τgrow. The first peak is often τgrow ≅ 5 d. The exponential growth is followed by a recovery phase with an exponential decay proportional to e−t/τrecov. For the characteristic time holds: τgrow&lt;&nbsp;τrecov. Even with isolation, outbreaks due to returning travellers can result in a recurrence of multi-peaks visible on log–lin scales. The exponential growth for the first wave is faster than for the succeeding waves, with characteristic times, τ of about 10 d. Our analysis ascertains that isolation is an efficient method in preventing contamination and enables an improved strategy for scientists, governments and the general public to timely balance between medical burdens, mental health, socio-economic and educational interests.","Vandamme, Lode K.

Eight observers (2 thoracic and 2 general senior radiologists, 2 junior radiologists, and 2 emergency physicians) retrospectively categorized each CT into one out of 4 categories (evocative, compatible for COVID-19 pneumonia, not evocative, and normal). Observer agreement for categorization between all readers and pairs of readers with similar experience was evaluated with the Kappa coefficient. The results of a consensus categorization were correlated to RT-PCR. RESULTS: Observer agreement across the 4 categories was good between all readers (&#954; value 0.61 95% CI 0.60-0.63) and moderate to good between pairs of readers (0.54-0.75).

207863,Design Performance and Frequency Response Analysis of SAW-Based Sensor for Dichloromethane Gas Sensing Amidst the COVID-19,2020,"Possibilities to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are rapidly growing. With the development of battery technologies, communication, navigation, surveillance, and autonomous systems in general, many UAVs are expected to operate at relatively low altitudes. Thus, the problem of UAV noise impact on human health and well-being will be more pronounced. In this paper, we conducted noise measurements of two UAVs of different performance (quadrotor and hexarotor) in flying up and down, hovering, and overflight procedures. Respondents of good hearing who were confirmed by audiogram measurement and had participated in the survey during UAV noise measurement gave their subjective assessments on the UAV noise perception. UAV noise measurements and subjective respondents' assessments were analysed and related. UAV noise analysis showed that the parameters measured at the same measurement point for the hexarotor were higher than those for the quadrotor in flying up and down and flying-over procedures. Low frequency noise was present in the noise spectrum of both drones. Participants were able to distinguish between the noise of UAVs and had a generally more negative experience with the hexarotor. Regardless of the noise perception, more than 80% of the respondents believe there are more pros than cons for UAV introduction into everyday life.","Ivosevic, Jurica; Ganic, Emir; Petosic, Antonio; Radisic, Tomislav",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,571

The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is having a huge impact on dermatological practice including the marked reduction of face-to-face consultations in favour of teledermatology, the uncertainties concerning the outcome of COVID-19 infection in patients with common inflammatory disorders such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis receiving immunosuppressive/immunomodulating systemic therapies; the direct involvement of dermatologists in COVID-19 care for patient assistance and new research needs to be addressed. It is not known yet if skin lesions and derangement of the skin barrier could make it easier for SARS-CoV-2 to transmit via indirect contact; it remains to be defined if specific mucosal or skin lesions are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, although some unpublished observations indicate the occurrence of a transient varicelliform exanthema during the early phase of the infection. SARS-CoV-2 is a new pathogen for humans that is highly contagious, can spread quickly, and is capable of causing enormous health, economic and societal impacts in any setting. The consequences may continue long after the pandemic resolves, and new management modalities for dermatology may originate from the COVID-19 disaster. Learning from experience may help to cope with future major societal changes.","Gisondi, P; Piaserico, S; Conti, A; Naldi, L",J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,,571

METHODS: This cross-sectional study makes comparison between two groups of nurses including frontline (exposure group) and other nurses working in usual wards (non-exposure group) in Torbat Heydariyeh city, Iran. Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI), Job stress questionnaire (JSQ), and questionnaires of hospital resources, family support, and measuring the fear of COVID-19 were used as research instruments. RESULTS: The scores of job stress and burnout in the exposure group with COVID-19 infection were significantly higher than in the non-exposure group (p=0.006 and p=0.002, respectively). Although, in univariate linear regression, employment status (p=0.047), experience in taking care of patient confirmed or suspected with COVID-19 infection (p=0.006), hospital resources (p=0.047), and job stress (p < 0.001) were considered as significant risk factors for COVID-19-related burnout. In multivariate regression analysis, job stress (p=0.031, ß=0.308) was considered as an only factor that has a significant relationship with COVID-19-related burnout. CONCLUSIONS: The burnout level in frontline nurses was higher than other nurses, the most important influencing factor was the job stress. Regarding to negative effects of burnout on both physical and mental health nurses, it is suggested that a strong strategy be considered to reduce nurses' burnout to be able to control ongoing and future outbreaks successfully.","Sarboozi Hoseinabadi, Tahere; Kakhki, Samaneh; Teimori, Gholamheidar; Nayyeri, Somayyeh",Invest. educ. enferm,,571

The Effects of COVID-19 on the AEC Market,2020,"Purpose: The tourism industry has been extensively affected by numerous disasters throughout its history including 30 decades of ethnic war, the tsunami disaster in 2004 and the Easter Sunday attack in 2019 substantially impacted the resources and capacities of the tourism industry in Sri Lanka. This study aims to explore the impact of COVID-19 on Sri Lanka as a tourism destination and the tourism industry as a resilient sector of the economy. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative study was conducted from July 2020 to September 2020 focusing on the perspectives of multi-level stakeholders in the tourism and hospitality industry in three distinct areas of Sri Lanka, namely, the coastal area, hill country and cultural triangle. The data were collected from 15 stakeholders via semistructured interviews. Convenience sampling method was used to choose the sample and thematic analysis was occupied to meet the study objectives. Findings: This study will help to reframe the resources and capacities of the country as an emerging destination identifying the diverse credentials from the perspective of different stakeholders to embed the essential resilience after the pandemic. Research limitations/implications: The prevailing lockdown situation and travel restrictions within the country was a huge challenge during the data collection process. Further to that, the respondents were reluctant to meet outsiders owing to the health threat, and hence some important stakeholders were missing from the study. Originality/value: This study proposes effective measures to build up a robust destination, necessary strategic planning for policymakers and provisions for stakeholders in the industry to address the health and safety of travelers in the case of future potential health epidemics. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Karunarathne, A.

208943,What Now? THE EFFECTS OF COVID-19 THE AEC MARKET,2020,"BACKGROUND: Total and differential white blood cell counts are important for the diagnostic evaluation of suspected diseases. To facilitate the interpretation of total and differential white blood cell counts in pediatric patients, the present study investigated age-dependent changes in total and differential white blood cell counts in healthy reference children. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Pediatric Reference Intervals in China study (PRINCE), which aims to establish and verify pediatric reference intervals for Chinese children based on a nationwide multicenter cross-sectional study from January 2017 to December 2018. Quantile curves were calculated using the generalized additive models for location, shape, and scale method. The 2.5th, 50th, and 97.5th quantile curves were calculated for both total and differential white blood counts. Percents of stacked area charts were used to demonstrate the proportions of differential white blood cells. All statistical analyses were performed using R software. RESULTS: Both 50th and 97.5th quantiles of total white blood cell count and monocyte count were highest at birth, then rapidly decreased in the first 6 months of life; relatively slow reduction continued until 2 years of age. The lymphocyte count was low during infancy and increased to its highest level at 6 months of age; it then exhibited moderate and continuous reduction until approximately 9 years of age. The pattern of neutrophil count changed with age in a manner opposite to that of lymphocyte count. Besides, there were two inter-sections of lymphocyte count and neutrophil count during infancy and at approximately 5 years of age, based on locally weighted regression (LOESS) analysis. There were no apparent age-related changes in eosinophil or basophil counts. CONCLUSION: These data regarding age-related changes in total and differential white blood cell counts can be used to assess the health of pediatric patients and guide clinical decisions.","Li, Kun; Peng, Ya-Guang; Yan, Ruo-Hua; Song, Wen-Qi; Peng, Xiao-Xia; Ni, Xin",Chin Med J (Engl),,571

209135,Prologue,2021,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a member of the human coronavirus (HCoV) family that targets the lower part of the respiratory tract and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In a short span of time, this infection has led to a global pandemic and has become a significant threat to the existence of present human society. Currently, there are no treatments for this infection and the measures established across various countries such as social distancing, usage of mask to prevent entry of the virus into the respiratory tract, quarantine, and containment together have reduced the prevalence of this disease and mortality in highly susceptible individuals. Here, we examine the structure, replication cycle, phylogeny and genomic organization of this virus and discuss the role of spike (S) protein of the virus, an important structure that interacts with the host ACE2 receptor facilitating viral entry. Further, we explore the epidemiology, symptoms of the disease, describe the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that establishes the diagnosis of the disease and also review its unique diagnostic features in the chest CT-Scan. Finally, we review the current approaches to develop therapies and vaccines as a measure for disease prevention and control.","Berekaa, Mahmoud M",Front Biosci (Elite Ed),,571

However, digestive symptoms have also been reported; at first considered as infrequent, they in fact seem to affect (to some extent) more than half of patients. The symptoms are mainly manifested by anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal pain. Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection. Digestive forms, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign. The main biological abnormalities that can suggest COVID-19 infection at an early stage are lymphopenia, elevated CRP and heightened ASAT transaminases. Thoraco-abdominal scan seems useful as a means of on the one hand ruling out digestive pathology not connected with coronavirus and on the other hand searching for pulmonary images compatible with COVID-19 infection. No data exist on the interest of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms. Moreover, the endoscopic surgeons may themselves be at significant risk of contamination. Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms. In some doubtful cases, virologic assessment of stool samples can yield definitive diagnosis. In the event of prolonged viral shedding in stools, a patient's persistent contagiousness is conceivable but not conclusively established. Upcoming serology should enable identification of the patients having been infected by the COVID-19 epidemic, particularly among previously undetected pauci-symptomatic members of a health care staff.

METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out during January and February 2020 amongst the general population of Karachi, Pakistan. A pre-tested, self-administered questionnaire was used among 399 young adult participants. The questionnaire was developed keeping in view of the already published study on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the available literature on COVID-19. It included sociodemographic information, assessment of knowledge, beliefs regarding coronavirus and the perception of precautionary measures taken by an individual. Chi-square test was used for categorical variables and p<0.05 was used as statistically significant. RESULTS: There were more females 299 (75%) than male participants 100 (25%). The mean age was 20.9 ±2.30 years and 232 (58%) had graduate degrees. There is lack of knowledge and awareness about coronavirus as 226 (56.6%) participants claimed that coronavirus is actually the most dangerous virus in the world, and 171 (43%) did know that the common flu virus is potentially more lethal than coronavirus. Although a large majority of participants correctly identified sources of transmission, measures and precautions to be taken for coronavirus, their knowledge for symptom identification was deficient. The most pursued platform for information for coronavirus was found to be social media, followed by television and print media. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlighted the level of awareness of coronavirus among young adults in Karachi, Pakistan. The study further pointed out the public knowledge gaps for the authorities concerned to help them develop more effective and successful awareness campaigns using preferred channels.","Mubeen, Syed Muhammad; Kamal, Shaheera; Kamal, Sufiyan; Balkhi, Fizra",J Pak Med Assoc,,571

There are currently no approved treatments available but only a few preventive measures are available. Among them, maintaining strong immunity through the intake of functional foods is a sustainable solution to resist the virus attack. For this, bioactive compounds (BACs) are delivered safely inside the body through encapsulated food items. Encapsulated food products have benefits such as high stability and bioavailability, sustained release of functional compounds;inhibit the undesired interaction, and high antimicrobial and antioxidant activity. Several BACs such as omega-3 fatty acid, curcumin, vitamins, essential oils, antimicrobials, and probiotic bacteria can be encapsulated which exhibit immunological activity through different mechanisms. These encapsulated compounds can be recommended for use by various researchers, scientists, and industrial peoples to develop functional foods that can improve immunity to withstand the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the future. Encapsulated BACs, upon incorporation into food, offer increased functionality and facilitate their potential use as an immunity booster. This review paper aims to target various encapsulated food products and their role in improving the immunity system. The bioactive components like antioxidants, minerals, vitamins, polyphenols, omega (omega)-3 fatty acids, lycopene, probiotics, etc. which boost the immunity and may be a potential measure to prevent COVID-19 outbreak were comprehensively discussed. This article also highlights the potential mechanisms;a BAC undergoes, to improve the immune system.","Tripathy, S.; Verma, D. K.; Thakur, M.; Patel, A. R.; Srivastav, P.

This study assessed the professional impact of the pandemic on genetic counselors (GCs) and evaluated how genetics service delivery models changed in New York State (NYS). One hundred sixty-five NYS GCs participated in an anonymous survey. Clinic structure, telegenetics (video and/or telephone consultations) use and acceptability, and professional practices before and during the pandemic were compared. The most frequently reported consultation type shifted from in-person only (49%) before the pandemic to telegenetics only (39%) during. Most were satisfied with video (93.1%) and telephone (81.4%) telegenetics. Additionally, 93.5% of participants expressed a desire to continue using telegenetics after the pandemic resolves. Common obstacles included difficulties coordinating sample collection (60.2%) and obtaining written consent for testing (57.6%). Billing methods for consultations during the pandemic did not change significantly. Participants were asked about NYS's lack of licensure, which restricts billing options. Most felt that genetic counseling licensure would benefit the profession (92.6%), the public (88.5%), and their institution/company (74.5%). This study provides insight into the effects of the rapid adoption of telegenetics and can guide future discussions about best practices for its use even after the health crisis resolves.","Bergstrom, Katherine L; Brander, Tehilla E; Breen, Kelsey E; Naik, Hetanshi",,,571

OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) by COVID-19 and to analyze the factors associated with this condition in adults and the elderly with cardiovascular disease in Brazil until the 30th Epidemiological Week of 2020. METHODS: Cross-sectional study conducted with data from the Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance Information System (Sistema de Informação de Vigilância Epidemiológica da Gripe - SIVEP-Gripe), referring to the SARS notification forms of hospitalized individuals in Brazil, between the 1st and 30th Epidemiological Week of 2020. Adults and the aged (≥ 18 years old) with CVD. The dependent variable was SRAG confirmation by COVID-19 and factors related to sociodemographic characteristics, signs and symptoms, and clinical factors were analyzed. Poisson regression with robust variance was applied. The level of significance adopted was 5%. RESULTS: Notifications from 116,343 individuals were analyzed. Of these, 61.9% were diagnosed with SARS by COVID-19. The prevalence of the outcome was 4% lower in women (95%CI: 0.94-0.99) and 18% lower in rural areas (95%CI: 0.77-0.87). There was a higher prevalence in the 50 to 59 age group (95%CI: 1.09-1.48) and in the northeast region (95%CI: 1.72-1.91). Fever, cough, admission to the ICU, use of ventilatory support, and nosocomial cases were also significantly associated with a higher probability of SRAS by COVID-19 in these individuals. CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of SARS by COVID-19 in adults and aged people with CVD in Brazil. Factors associated with sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, signs, and symptoms were associated.","Paiva, K. M.; Hillesheim, D.; Rech, C. R.; Delevatti, R. S.; Brown, R. V.

Accessing and sharing data to foster collaboration],2020,"BACKGROUND: Hand hygiene is an efficacious behaviour to prevent community-associated infections. Estimates of the proportion of populations who wash their hands have indicated limited compliance. While biases of self-report items for hand hygiene, such as the tendency to overestimate one's behaviour, represent a limitation, direct survey questions remain important. This study aims to compare indices of handwashing compliance based on single vs. combined handwashing attributes, i.e., its frequency, technique, and duration. METHODS: Data of a representative survey on hygiene and infection control by the German Federal Centre for Health Education were analysed. In a cross-sectional, computer-assisted telephone interview design, the resident population in Germany aged 16-85 years was surveyed in 2012. For handwashing, duration, frequency in different situations, and technique (use of soap, washing interdigital spaces, and drying hands) were self-reported. Self-reports were rated as (non-)compliant based on national recommendations and combined into single- and multi-attribute indices. Use of hand disinfectants, recall of handwashing instruction plates in public restrooms, and socio-demographics were also assessed. In total, N = 4483 persons participated (response rate: 49.7%). Data were weighted to compensate for sampling bias and analysed by cross-tabulation and multiple logistic regression. Primarily due to missing data, the analysis was confined to N = 4093 respondents (i.e., 91%). RESULTS: Among women, the proportion of those who reported to wash hands ""almost always"" in at least seven of nine situations was 30.8% (men: 20.3%). In contrast, 51% of men reported always using soap, drying hands, and washing interdigital spaces (women: 43.5%; p < 0.001). Compliance based on indices that included ""frequency"" was higher in women by 5.2% for ""frequency + technique"" (17.6% vs. 12.4%), and 2.5% for ""frequency + duration"" (13.1% vs. 10.6%) and ""frequency + duration + technique"" (8.8% vs. 6.3%; p < 0.02). Socio-demographic differences were most consistent regarding higher compliance among healthcare workers. Finally, especially men recalling handwashing instruction plates in public restrooms had higher compliance than those with no recall, namely, for ""frequency + technique"" (15.4% vs. 10.6%; OR: 1.9), all three attributes (7.6% vs. 5.3%; OR = 1.7), and ""technique"" (56.9% vs. 47.7%; OR = 1.6). The highest odds ratio was noted for disinfectant use among men (OR = 2.5; 12.2% vs. 4.9%). DISCUSSION: While being representative for Germany, limitations include the survey's cross-sectionality, response rate, and the study representing the situation in 2012. Nonetheless, indices based on combined attributes allow better comparison to scarce compliance estimates for Germany based on observation. Socio-demographic differences add to existing evidence, e.g., higher compliance by healthcare workers. Finally, although reverse causation is possible, it is notable that although handwashing instruction plates in public restrooms focus on duration and technique, women recalling them reported higher frequency, and men more often report hand disinfectant use, suggesting possible carry-over effects. CONCLUSION: Self-reported handwashing compliance assessment may be improved by partitioning the behavioural domain into different attributes and using indices based on combinations of these.","Mardiko, Amelia A; von Lengerke, Thomas",Int J Hyg Environ Health,,571

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who underwent thorax CT for COVID pneumonia and MRI for any reason within 24 hours after CT were included in the study. The number of lobes affected, number of lobes containing ground-glass opacities and consolidation, number of nodules, distribution of lesions (central, peripheral, or diffuse), lobes with centrilobular nodular pattern, and the presence of pleural effusion were recorded separately for both imaging methods. RESULTS: Seventeen of the patients were female (53%) and 15 were male (47%). The mean age of the patients was 60.5 (range, 20-85) years. A total of 31 patients (96%) had signs of pneumonia on CT. The most common finding in CT was ground-glass opacities in 29 patients (90.6%), followed by consolidation in 14 patients (43.75%). Both consolidation and ground-glass opacities were also observed in MRI in all of these patients. Nodules were detected in 12 patients (37.5%) on CT and 11 patients (34.4%) on MRI. The sensitivity and specificity of MRI in nodule detection were calculated as 91.67% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Although thorax CT is widely used in the imaging of COVID-19 infection, due to its advantages, MRI can also be used as an alternative diagnostic tool.","Ates, Omer Faruk; Taydas, Onur; Dheir, Hamad",Acad Radiol,,571

212556,COVID-19: challenges and opportunities,2020,"Pro-tumorigenic electrochemical synapses between neurons and brain tumor cells in pre-clinical studies suggest unfavorable effects of epilepsy on patient survival. We investigated associations of epilepsy and survival in three cohorts of brain tumor patients (meningioma, glioblastoma, brain metastases). Cohorts were segregated into three groups for comparative analyses: (i) no epilepsy, (ii) epilepsy without status epilepticus and (iii) status epilepticus. Status epilepticus was considered a surrogate of extensive neuronal hyperexcitability. Main outcome was progression-free survival (meningioma) and overall survival (glioblastoma and brain metastases), adjusted for established prognostic factors and onset of epilepsy by time-dependent multivariate Cox modeling. The primary analysis population comprised 1792 patients (742 meningioma, 249 glioblastoma, 801 brain metastases). Epilepsy was associated with favorable prognostic factors. On multivariate analyses, status epilepticus was however associated with inferior overall survival of patients with glioblastoma (status epilepticus vs no epilepsy multivariate HR 3.72, CI 1.78-7.76, P<0.001) and brain metastases (status epilepticus vs no epilepsy HR 2.30, CI 1.10-4.79, P=0.026). Among brain metastases patients, but not among patients with meningioma or glioblastoma, epilepsy was similarly associated with inferior overall survival (epilepsy vs no epilepsy HR 2.16, CI 1.60-2.93, P<0.001). We conclude that epilepsy may convey inferior survival of patients with malignant brain tumors.","Mastall, Maximilian; Wolpert, Fabian; Gramatzki, Dorothee; Imbach, Lukas; Becker, Denise; Schmick, Anton; Hertler, Caroline; Roth, Patrick; Weller, Michael; Wirsching, Hans-Georg",Brain,,571

The goal of this study was to assess patients' experiences receiving sleep care by telehealth. METHODS: From June 2019 to May 2020, the authors recruited a sample of patients for semi-structured interviews, including patients who had one of three types of telehealth encounters in sleep medicine: in-clinic video, home-based video, and telephone. Two analysts coded transcripts using content analysis and identified themes that cut across patients and categories. RESULTS: The authors conducted interviews with 35 patients and identified five themes. 1) Improved access to care: Patients appreciated telehealth as providing access to sleep care in a timely and convenient manner. 2) Security and Privacy: Patients described how home-based telehealth afforded them greater feelings of safety and security due to avoidance of anxiety provoking triggers (e.g. crowds). Patients also noted a potential loss of privacy with telehealth. 3) Personalization of care: Patients described experiences with telehealth care that either improved or hindered their ability to communicate their needs. 4) Patient Empowerment: Patients described how telehealth empowered them to manage their sleep disorders. 5) Unmet Needs: Patients recognized specific areas where telehealth did not meet their needs, including the need for tangible services (e.g. mask fitting). CONCLUSION: Patients expressed both positive and negative experiences, highlighting areas where telehealth can be further adapted.

Nosocomial infection of COVID­19 directly impacts the quality of life of patients, as well as results in extra expenditure to hospitals. It has been shown that COVID­19 is more likely to transmit via close, unprotected contact with infected patients. Additionally, current preventative and containment measures tend to overlook asymptomatic individuals and superspreading events. Since the mode of transmission and real origin of COVID­19 in hospitals has not been fully elucidated yet, minimizing nosocomial infection in hospitals remains a difficult but urgent task for healthcare professionals. Healthcare professionals globally should form an alliance against nosocomial COVID­19 infections. The fight against COVID­19 may provide valuable lessons for the future prevention and control of nosocomial infections.

214299,Capacity of local authority and community on epidemic response in Vietnam: Implication for COVID-19 preparedness,2020,"PURPOSE: As our hospitals conserve and re-allocate resources during the COVID-19 crisis, there is urgent need to determine how best to continue caring for breast cancer patients. During the time window before the COVID-19 critical peak and particularly thereafter, as hospitals are able to resume cancer operations, we anticipate that there will be great need to maximize efficiency to treat breast cancer. The goal of this study is to present a same-day protocol that minimizes resource utilization to enable hospitals to increase inpatient capacity, while providing care for breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction during the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: IRB exempt patient quality improvement initiative was conducted to detail the operationalization of a novel same-day breast reconstruction protocol. Consecutive patients having undergone immediate breast reconstruction were prospectively enrolled between February and March of 2020 at Massachusetts General Hospital during the COVID-19 crisis. Peri-operative results and postoperative complications were summarized. RESULTS: Time interval from surgical closure to patient discharge was 5.02 ± 1.29 h. All patients were discharged home, with no re-admissions or emergency department visits. No postoperative complications were observed. CONCLUSION: This report provides an instruction manual to operationalize a same-day breast reconstruction protocol, to meet demands of providing appropriate cancer treatment during times of unprecedented resource limitations. Pre-pectoral implant-based breast reconstruction can be the definitive procedure or be used as a bridge to autologous reconstruction. Importantly, we hope this work will be helpful to our patients and community as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Specht, Michelle; Sobti, Nikhil; Rosado, Nikki; Tomczyk, Eleanor; Abbate, Olivia; Ellis, Dan; Liao, Eric C",Breast cancer res. treat,,571

214572,Characterizing two outbreak waves of COVID-19 in Spain using phenomenological epidemic modelling,2021,"Context: Screening for malaria and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in all patients with acute febrile illness is necessary in malaria-endemic areas to reduce malaria-related mortality and to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 by isolation. Aims: A pilot study was undertaken to determine the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among febrile patients attending a malaria clinic. Subjects and Methods: All patients were tested for malaria parasite by examining thick and thin blood smears as well as by rapid malaria antigen tests. COVID-19 was detected by rapid antigen test and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in patients agreeing to undergo the test. Results: Out of 262 patients examined, 66 (25.19%) were positive for Plasmodium vivax, 45 (17.17%) for Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) with a slide positivity rate of 42.40%, and Pf% of 40.50%. Only 29 patients consented for COVID-19 testing along with malaria;of them, 3 (10.34%) were positive for COVID-19 alone and 2 (6.89%) were positive for both COVID-19 and P. vivax with an incidence of 17.24%. A maximum number of patients (196) did not examine for COVID-19 as they did not agree to do the test. Conclusion: Diagnosis of COVID-19 among three patients (10.34%) is significant both in terms of identification of cases and to isolate them for preventing transmission in the community. Detection of COVID-19 along with malaria is equally important for their proper management. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

We present a case of a young veteran who presented with e-cigarette vaping associated lung injury (EVALI) to a primary care clinic and who required subsequent inpatient admission and home oxygen therapy after discharge. The patient afterwards improved after a three-month course of steroids and cessation of THC-containing electronic cigarettes, consistent with previously reported cases. Furthermore, evidence on bronchoscopy and biopsy demonstrated intracellular lipid droplets in the patient's macrophages. This outpatient case of EVALI prompts primary care providers to raise suspicion of this condition, and enquire about the use of e-cigarettes, particularly THC-containing vaping products. Furthermore, in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, similar clinical and radiographic presentations between COVID-19 and EVALI can be seen.","Galo, Jason; Celli, Diego; Gross, Dana; Holt, Gregory; Campos, Michael",Respir.

This roster was aimed at providing staff with 'manageable shift lengths, down-time between shifts, regular breaks and access to refreshments' as dictated by the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services. METHODS: Creating six fixed teams in our ED. Teams work blocks of three consecutive days of 12 h shifts, each block alternates between day and night shifts. RESULTS: We managed to completely eliminate unnecessary crossover of staff thus reducing risk of having a large part of our workforce incapacitated should any member be affected by COVID. CONCLUSION: A pandemic roster plan to minimise staff exposure from other colleagues during a pandemic was possible. This helps to ensure an adequate workforce in the unfortunate event a staff contracts the disease leading to other close contact staff requiring isolation or succumbing to the same illness.","Au, Benjamin Wy; Tranquilino, Ramil; Apswoude, Geraldine; Crock, Carmel",Emerg. med Australas,,571
215131,Meeting the Nursing Research World in the Time of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: There is a need to determine which clinical variables predict the severity of COVID-19. We analyzed a series of critically ill COVID-19 patients to see if any of our dataset's clinical variables were associated with patient outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of the Hospital in Pordenone from March 11, 2020, to April 17, 2020. Patients' characteristics of survivors and deceased groups were compared. The variables with a different distribution between the two groups were implemented in a generalized linear regression model (LM) and in an Artificial Neural Network (NN) model to verify the ""robustness"" of the association with mortality. RESULTS: In the considered period, we reviewed the data of 22 consecutive patients: 8 died. The causes of death were a severe respiratory failure (3), multi-organ failure (1), septic shock (1), pulmonary thromboembolism (2), severe hemorrhage (1). Lymphocyte and the platelet count were significantly lower in the group of deceased patients (p-value 0.043 and 0.020, respectively; cut-off values: 660/mm3; 280,000/mm3, respectively). Prothrombin time showed a statistically significant trend (p-value= 0.065; cut-off point: 16.8/sec). The LM model (AIC= 19.032), compared to the NN model (Mean Absolute Error, MAE = 0.02), was substantially alike (MSE 0.159 vs. 0.136). CONCLUSIONS: In the context of critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU, lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and lengthening of prothrombin time were strictly correlated with higher mortality. Additional clinical data are needed to be able to validate this prognostic score.","Venturini, Sergio; Orso, Daniele; Cugini, Francesco; Crapis, Massimo; Fossati, Sara; Callegari, Astrid; Pellis, Tommaso; Tomasello, Dario Carmelo; Tonizzo, Maurizio; Grembiale, Alessandro; D039,; Andrea, Natascia; Vetrugno, Luigi; Bove, Tiziana",Acta Biomed,,571

216789,The Lingering Effects of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Pathology education provides information on pathology and guides students to become pathologists. Recently, the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China required the establishment of the system of 'High-quality Online and Offline Courses', which indicates that online courses will play an important role in higher education. Furthermore, the number of pathologists currently cannot satisfy clinical needs. To solve this health issue and implement the policy from the Ministry of Education, it is necessary to improve the current state of pathology education. First, we need to know students' opinions of the current courses and their professional choices. METHODS: Online questionnaires covering the quality of traditional courses, attitudes towards online courses, and suggestions for optimizing courses were designed and applied. Whether students want to become pathologists and the underlying reasons for this interest are also included in this survey. Participants are medical students from certain colleges in Nanjing. The collected data were assessed by statistical analyses, and p-values less than 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: Of the 342 valid responses, 60.94% of undergraduate students showed their interest in pathology courses, and among them, 48.72% expressed that they may become pathologists. However, the corresponding percentage is only 29.59% in the group without interest. To optimize curricula, the top two suggestions are introducing more clinical cases (undergraduate students, 64.45%; graduate students, 79.09%) and making the classes lively and interesting (undergraduate students, 59.77%; graduate students, 62.79%). Approximately 80.00% of students consider online courses to be good supplementary materials to traditional courses, and approximately half prefer an online-offline mixed learning model. Salary, interest, and employment status are the main factors influencing students' professional choices. CONCLUSIONS: Students are generally satisfied with traditional pathology courses, and online courses are good supplementary materials in their opinions. It has been suggested that clinical cases be introduced in classes. It is more likely that students who have an interest in pathology will become pathologists. The data from this survey also show that the main causes of the shortage of pathologists are a lack of engaging work and an unsatisfactory salary.","Xu, Chun; Li, Yiping; Chen, Pingsheng; Pan, Min; Bu, Xiaodong",BMC Med Educ,,571

The main transmission route of salmonellosis has been identified as poorly cooked meat and poultry products contaminated with Salmonella. However, in recent years, the number of outbreaks attributed to contaminated raw produce has increased dramatically. To understand how Salmonella adapts to produce, transcriptomic analysis was conducted on Salmonella enterica serovar Virchow exposed to fresh-cut radish greens. Considering the different Salmonella lifestyles in contact with fresh produce, such as motile and sessile lifestyles, total RNA was extracted from planktonic and epiphytic cells separately. Transcriptomic analysis of S. Virchow cells revealed different transcription profiles between lifestyles. During bacterial adaptation to fresh-cut radish greens, planktonic cells were likely to shift toward anaerobic metabolism, exploiting nitrate as an electron acceptor of anaerobic respiration, and utilizing cobalamin as a cofactor for coupled metabolic pathways. Meanwhile, Salmonella cells adhering to plant surfaces showed coordinated upregulation in genes associated with translation and ribosomal biogenesis, indicating dramatic cellular reprogramming in response to environmental changes. In accordance with the extensive translational response, epiphytic cells showed an increase in the transcription of genes that are important for bacterial motility, nucleotide transporter/metabolism, cell envelope biogenesis, and defense mechanisms. Intriguingly, Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI)-1 and SPI-2 displayed up- and downregulation, respectively, regardless of lifestyles in contact with the radish greens, suggesting altered Salmonella virulence during adaptation to plant environments. This study provides molecular insights into Salmonella adaptation to plants as an alternative environmental reservoir.","Park, Sojung; Nam, Eun Woo; Kim, Yeeun; Lee, Seohyeon; Kim, Seul I; Yoon, Hyunjin",,,571

217190,COVID-19: Injury Prevention from N95 Masks,2020,"This study shows how detik.com, a pioneer and one of the largest online media companies in Indonesia frames the Covid-19 pandemic crisis. From the 6713 news reports in January, February and March, the most dominant framing of the crisis that appeared in the coverage was attribution of responsibility, followed by frame of human interest, frame of morality, frame of conflict and the last is frame of economic consequences. The quantitative approach was used in this research to ensure that systematic analysis and non-arbitrary procedures can be carried out on large amounts of data. This study offered a better understanding on of how online media framed the crisis during the pandemic. The results of this study indicate that the frame of attribution of responsibility is not only the most widely used by detik.com, but also the most dominant when the government is the main source of the news. The form of attribution of responsibility in times of crisis tends to be stronger in the realm of government because crisis events are widespread, forming an experience felt at the national level. As a result, crisis events have the potential to become political symbols used in framing various debates regarding a policy in the long run. The average tone of news towards the government from January to March was positive, although it gradually became more negative. © 2021 Jurnal Ilmu Sosial dan Ilmu Politik.

Large population limits of the model are derived giving both convergence results for the early branching process-like behaviour, and, assuming a major outbreak, the main phase of the epidemic process which converges to a deterministic model that is equivalent to a certain pair approximation model. Law of large numbers results are also obtained for the final size (i.e. total number of individuals infected) of a major outbreak. Two results stand out (valid for a range of parameter set-ups): (i) the limiting final fraction infected may be discontinuous in the infection rate $\lambda$ at its threshold $\lambda_c$ (thus making a discrete jump from $0$ to a strictly positive number) and (ii) for the situation when rewiring is necessarily to uninfected individuals, if it is discontinuous, the limiting final fraction infected jumps from $0$ to $1$ as $\lambda$ passes through $\lambda_c$.","Ball, Frank; Britton, Tom",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06375v1.pdf,571

Our legal analysis suggests that although international law provides states with the option of declaring an SOE and derogating from human rights obligations to ensure the life of the nation, other ways to handle the pandemic without declaring an SOE do exist Our theoretical analysis leads to three main propositions centred on the impact of regional diffusion, democratic institutions, and pandemic preparedness Our empirical analysis combines a range of quantitative data sources to analyse the SOE decisions of 180 states during the first half of 2020 The results suggest that states’ declarations of SOEs are driven by both external and internal factors A permissive regional environment, characterised by many simultaneously declared SOEs, may reduce the reputational and political costs of emergency powers, making their employment more palatable At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically democratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, have shaped governments’ decisions Weak democracies with poor preparedness have been considerably more likely to opt for an SOE than dictatorships and robust democracies with higher preparedness © 2021 The Author(s) Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","Lundgren, M.; Klamberg, M.; Sundström, K.; Dahlqvist, J.",Nordic Journal of Human Rights,,571

United States has been the hardest hit country both with incidence and absolute mortality from COVID-19. In some of its states the health care system have been stretched to their limits. This has led to a rapid change in the health care practice due to newly approved emergency legislative bills, new state government laws, measures taken by institutions and practices as well as the changing consumer behavior. Some of these adaptations - in particular, the transition of patient care to virtual visits are revolutionary. Increased vigilance by health care organization and workers to minimize the spread of infection to others as well for personal protection may result in lasting behavioral change that will prevent hospital acquired or transmitted infections and may lead to reduced morbidity and mortality from the regular ""flu"". The recycling of personal protective equipment and the emerging research showing it a safe practice will reduce health care expenditure. It is quite possible that this pandemic may be the silver lining that will save the US health care from its unsustainable consumption of US gross domestic product.","Naqvi, Tasneem Z",Rev Cardiovasc Med,,571

Clinical features in children have varied but predominantly include shock, cardiac dysfunction, abdominal pain, and elevated inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, D-dimer, and interleukin-6 (1). Since June 2020, several case reports have described a similar syndrome in adults; this review describes in detail nine patients reported to CDC, seven from published case reports, and summarizes the findings in 11 patients described in three case series in peer-reviewed journals (4-6). These 27 patients had cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and neurologic symptoms without severe respiratory illness and concurrently received positive test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibody assays indicating recent infection. Reports of these patients highlight the recognition of an illness referred to here as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A), the heterogeneity of clinical signs and symptoms, and the role for antibody testing in identifying similar cases among adults. Clinicians and health departments should consider MIS-A in adults with compatible signs and symptoms. These patients might not have positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test results, and antibody testing might be needed to confirm previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because of the temporal association between MIS-A and SARS-CoV-2 infections, interventions that prevent COVID-19 might prevent MIS-A. Further research is needed to understand the pathogenesis and long-term effects of this newly described condition.","Morris, Sapna Bamrah; Schwartz, Noah G; Patel, Pragna; Abbo, Lilian; Beauchamps, Laura; Balan, Shuba; Lee, Ellen H; Paneth-Pollak, Rachel; Geevarughese, Anita; Lash, Maura K; Dorsinville, Marie S; Ballen, Vennus; Eiras, Daniel P; Newton-Cheh, Christopher; Smith, Emer; Robinson, Sara; Stogsdill, Patricia; Lim, Sarah; Fox, Sharon E; Richardson, Gillian; Hand, Julie; Oliver, Nora T; Kofman, Aaron; Bryant, Bobbi; Ende, Zachary; Datta, Deblina; Belay, Ermias; Godfred-Cato, Shana",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,571

Scientists measure trace elements in environmental media in order to assess the quality and safety of ecosystems and to quantify the burden of anthropogenic pollution. Among the available analytical techniques, X-ray based methods are particularly powerful, as they can quantify trace elements in situ. Chemical extraction is not required, as is the case for many other analytical techniques. In the last few years, the potential for X-ray techniques to be applied in the environmental sciences has dramatically increased due to developments in laboratory instruments and synchrotron radiation facilities with improved sensitivity and spatial resolution. In this report, we summarize the principles of the X-ray based analytical techniques most frequently employed to study trace elements in environmental samples. We report on the most recent developments in laboratory and synchrotron techniques, as well as advances in instrumentation, with a special attention on X-ray sources, detectors, and optics.

Yet the degree to which laypeople are aware of these disparities and support equitable ventilator allocation remains unclear. This mixed methods study investigated laypeople’s awareness and the rationales they provided for ventilator allocation. Adults from the United States (N = 249) participated in the study in April 2020. They selected between photos of two people in four comparisons, indicating who they believed was more likely to be affected by COVID-19, to whom they would allocate a ventilator, and their rationale for allocation. Black individuals were more frequently rated as affected by COVID-19 and selected to receive a ventilator. Participants who selected the Black individual to receive a ventilator cited COVID-19 statistics and structural-level need, while participants who selected the White individual cited physical appearance (weight and age) as their rationale. Public support for equitable COVID-19 health policies (e.g., finances for production of ventilators, lock-down and mask-wearing policies) can potentially be harnessed by underscoring differential rates of infection, hospitalization, death, and highlighting structural need.

219861,Long-Term Impact of Social Isolation and Molecular Underpinnings,2020,"BACKGROUND: Surgery remains the first curative treatment for colorectal cancer. Prehabilitation seems to attenuate the loss of lean mass in the early postoperative period. However, its long-term role has not been studied. Lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic has forced to carry out the prehabilitation program at home. This study aimed to assess the effect of home prehabilitation on body composition, complications, and hospital stay in patients undergoing oncological colorectal surgery. METHODS: A prospective and randomized clinical study was conducted in 20 patients operated of colorectal cancer during COVID-19 lockdown (13 March to 21 June 2020) in a single university clinical hospital. Patients were randomized into two study groups (10 per group): prehabilitation vs standard care. Changes in lean mass and fat mass at 45 and 90 days after surgery were measured using multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis. RESULTS: Prehabilitation managed to reduce hospital stay (4.8 vs 7.2 days, p = 0.052) and postoperative complications (20% vs 50%, p = 0.16). Forty-five days after surgery, the loss of lean mass decreased (1.7% vs 7.1%, p = 0.17). These differences in lean mass were attenuated at 90 days; however, the standard care group increased considerably their fat mass compared to the prehabilitation group (+ 8.72% vs - 8.16%). CONCLUSIONS: Home prehabilitation has proven its effectiveness, achieving an attenuation of lean mass loss in the early postoperative period and a lower gain in fat mass in the late postoperative period. In addition, it has managed to reduce hospital stays and postoperative complications.

The objective was to analyse the ethical questions raised by the French ENT community during the first wave of Covid-19 infections. METHODS: Four open-ended questions concerning ethical considerations in ENT were sent out in April 2020: (i) difficulties to care for covid-19 positive patients; (ii) impact of the health crisis on covid-19 negative patients; (iii) communication within the healthcare teams and with hospital staff; and (iv) management of information by the press, or national ENT societies. A thematic analysis was carried out and crossed with the epidemiological data of each respondent. RESULTS: 31 responses from 13 different French Departments, including 21 from public institutions and 10 from private practice, median age of 45 and 17 men for 14 women, were analysed. The main ethical considerations concerned the management by ENTs of covid-19 positive patients, the modification of practices in consultation and in the operating room, the fear of loss of chance for covid-19 negative patients, the appropriate use of teleconsultations and teleworking and the consequences of fake-news for the population. CONCLUSION: In preparation of possible future pandemic outbreaks, key ethical aspects are to adapt patient management to local resources and infection prevalence, and circulate clear institutional guidelines.","Simon, François; Plisson, Laetitia; Heutte, Natacha; Leboulanger, Nicolas; Barry, Béatrix; Babin, Emmanuel; Parietti-Winkler, Cécile",Etique &amp; sante (Imprime),,571

To date, there has been no comprehensive assessment of the impact of lockdowns on air quality and human health. Using global satellite observations and ground measurements from 36 countries in Europe, North America, and East Asia, we find that lockdowns led to reductions in NO2 concentrations globally, resulting in ~32,000 avoided premature mortalities, including ~21,000 in China. However, we do not find corresponding reductions in PM2.5 and ozone globally. Using satellite measurements, we show that the disconnect between NO2 and ozone changes stems from local chemical regimes.

Amongst different forms of bioenergy, lignocellulosic biomass can be utilized as an attractive substrate for the production of several high-value products owing to its renewability, easy availability, and abundance. Additionally, utilization of these waste biomasses reduces the environmental hazards associated with its disposal. Impedance of lignin and crystalline nature of cellulose pose major bottlenecks in biomass based energy. Though, several physio-chemicals processes are recommended as mitigation route but none of them seems to be promising for large scale application. In recent years, a right fusion of biological treatment combined with nanotechnology for efficient pretreatment and subsequent hydrolysis of biomass by ubiquitous enzymes seems to be promising alternative. In addition, to overcome these difficulties, nanotechnology-based methods have been recently adopted in catalytic valorization of lignocellulosic biomass. The present review has critically discussed the application of nano-biotechnology in lignocellulosic biomass valorization in terms of pretreatment and hydrolysis. A detailed discussion on the application of various nanoparticles in these processes, enzyme immobilization and end-production utilization is presented in this review. Finally, the review emphasizes the major challenges of this process along with different routes and recommendations to address the issues.","Roy, Sharmili; Dikshit, Pritam Kumar; Sherpa, Knawang Chhunji; Singh, Anshu; Jacob, Samuel; Chandra Rajak, Rajiv",J Environ Manage,,571

It is unknown whether deprivation mediates this excess ethnic risk. METHODS: We used UK Biobank with linked COVID-19 outcomes occurring between 16th March 2020 and 24th August 2020. A four-way decomposition mediation analysis was used to model the extent to which the excess risk of testing positive, severe disease and mortality for COVID-19 in South Asian and black individuals, relative to white individuals, would be eliminated if levels of high material deprivation were reduced within the population. RESULTS: 15,044 (53.0% women) South Asian and black and 392,786 (55.2% women) white individuals were included. There were 151 (1.0%) positive tests, 91 (0.6%) severe cases and 31 (0.2%) deaths due to COVID-19 in South Asian and black individuals compared to 1,471 (0.4%), 895 (0.2%) and 313 (0.1%), respectively, in white individuals. Compared to white individuals, the relative risk of testing positive for COVID-19, developing severe disease and COVID-19 mortality in South Asian and black individuals were 2.73 (95% CI: 2.26, 3.19), 2.96 (2.31, 3.61) and 4.04 (2.54, 5.55), respectively. A hypothetical intervention moving the 25% most deprived in the population out of deprivation was modelled to eliminate between 40-50% of the excess risk of all COVID-19 outcomes in South Asian and black populations, whereas moving the 50% most deprived out of deprivation would eliminate over 80% of the excess risk of COVID-19 outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The excess risk of COVID-19 outcomes in South Asian and black communities could be substantially reduced with population level policies targeting material deprivation.","Razieh, Cameron; Zaccardi, Francesco; Islam, Nazrul; Gillies, Clare L; Chudasama, Yogini; Rowlands, Alex; Kloecker, David E; Davies, Melanie J; Khunti, Kamlesh; Yates, Thomas",Eur. j. public health,,571

This Dutch study confirms that there is a (highly) significant inverse correlation between pollen count and weekly changes in medical flu consults, and that there is a highly significant inverse correlation between hay fever incidence, as measured by prescribed medication revenues, and weekly flu consults. This supports the idea that pollen are a direct or indirect factor in the seasonality of flu-like epidemics. If seasonality will be observed during the covid-19 spread as well, it is not unlikely that pollen play a role.","Hoogeveen, Martijn J",Sci Total Environ,,571

Particularly, it could be difficult for health care professional to recommend a suitable app for COVID-19 education and self-monitoring purposes. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyse and evaluate the contents as well as features of COVID-19 mobile apps. The findings are instrumental in helping healthcare professionals to identify suitable mobile apps for COVID-19 self-monitoring and education. The results of the mobile apps assessment can potentially help mobile app developers improve or modify their existing mobile app designs to achieve optimal outcomes. METHODS: The search for the mobile health apps available in android-based Play Store and iOS-based App Store was conducted between 18 April to 5 May 2020. The region of the App Store where we performed the search on was the United States, while a virtual private network app was used to locate and access COVID-19 mobile apps from all countries on Google Play Store. The inclusion criteria were apps that are related to COVID-19 with no restriction in language type. The basic features assessment criteria used for comparison were the requirement for free subscription, Internet connection, education/advisory content, size of app, ability to export data and automated data entry. The functionality of the apps was assessed according to: (1) knowledge (information on COVID-19), (2) tracing/mapping of COVID-19 cases, (3) home monitoring surveillance, (4) online consultation with a health authority, and (5) official apps run by health authorities. RESULTS: Of 223 COVID-19 related mobile apps, only 56 (35%) found in App Store and 54 (85.7%) in Play Store matched the inclusion criteria. In the basic features assessment, most App Store (33.3%) and Play Store (35.7%) apps scored 4 out of 7 points. Meanwhile, the outcome of the functionality assessment for most App Store apps (43.3%) was a score of 3, compared to android-based apps (35.7%), which scored 2 (out of maximum point 5). Evaluation of basic functions showed that 88% of included mobile apps do not require subscription, 62% provide symptom advice, and 45% have educational content. In term of the specific functions, more than half of the included mobile apps are official mobile apps maintained by a health authority for COVID-19 information provision. Around 40% and 31% of the mobile apps have tracing/mapping and home monitoring surveillance functions, respectively, with only 17% of mobile apps equipped with an online consultation function. CONCLUSIONS: Most iOS-based apps incorporate infographic mapping of COVID-19 cases while most android-based apps incorporate home-monitoring surveillance features, instead of providing focused educational content on COVID-19. It is important to evaluate the contents and features of COVID-19 mobile apps to guide users in choosing the suitable mobile app based on their requirements.","Ming, Long Chiau; Untong, Noorazrina; Aliudin, Nur Amalina; Osili, Norliza; Kifli, Nurolaini; Tan, Ching Siang; Goh, Khang Wen; Ng, Pit Wei; Al-Worafi, Yaser Mohammed; Lee, Kah Seng; Goh, Hui Poh",,,571

We analyzed 42 unexposed healthy donors and 28 mild COVID-19 subjects up to 5 months from the recovery for SARS-CoV-2 specific immunological memory. Using HLA class II predicted peptide megapools, we identified SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive CD4+ T cells in around 66% of the unexposed individuals. Moreover, we found detectable immune memory in mild COVID-19 patients several months after recovery in the crucial arms of protective adaptive immunity; CD4+ T cells and B cells, with a minimal contribution from CD8+ T cells. Interestingly, the persistent immune memory in COVID-19 patients is predominantly targeted towards the Spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2. This study provides the evidence of both high magnitude pre-existing and persistent immune memory in Indian population. By providing the knowledge on cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, our work has implication for the development and implementation of vaccines against COVID-19.","Ansari, Asgar; Arya, Rakesh; Sachan, Shilpa; Jha, Someshwar Nath; Kalia, Anurag; Lall, Anupam; Sette, Alessandro; Grifoni, Alba; Weiskopf, Daniela; Coshic, Poonam; Sharma, Ashok; Gupta, Nimesh",Front Immunol,,571

Our hypotheses were that being a junior doctor, having a previous mental health diagnosis and treating Covid-19 positive patients would predict higher rates of distress. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey conducted via Survey Monkey. Voluntary participants were recruited from the mailing list of a national-based referral service for doctors to psychiatrists. Distress was measured using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Demographic factors were analysed for predictive value of a higher rating on the K10. Areas of concern in relation to Covid-19 and preference for support services were measured on a Likert scale and compared to levels of distress. RESULTS: The rate of very high distress was 15%. Being a junior doctor and having a previous mental health diagnosis were predictive factors of a higher K10 score. K10 was not affected by likelihood of contact with Covid-19-positive patients. Social isolation had a larger impact on mental health in the context of a previous psychiatric diagnosis. Face-to-face assessments were preferred. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of distress in doctors have been higher than baseline during Covid-19. Some groups have been particularly vulnerable.","Adams, Michelle Anne; Brazel, Matthew; Thomson, Richard; Lake, Hannah",Australas Psychiatry,,571

226342,"COVID-19 risk governance_ drivers, responses and lessons to be learned",2020,"Spiophanes bombyx (Claparède, 1870) from the Gulf of Naples, Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy, was the first described Spiophanes with fronto-lateral horns on the prostomium. It was also considered the only horned species occurring in European waters. Our sequence data of five gene fragments suggest the presence of two horned sibling Spiophanes species in northern Europe: S. cf. bombyx in the North and the Norwegian seas, and S. cf. convexus in Brittany, northern France, and Bay of Biscay, northern Spain. Spiophanes cf. bombyx worms are genetically close to a single examined specimen of S. bombyx from Venice Lagoon, Italy but their conspecificity should be verified by further study. Our sequence data show that horned Spiophanes from the North Pacific are genetically distant from horned European species, and that S. uschakowi Zachs, 1933, originally described from the Sea of Japan (East Sea) is a valid species. The data also suggest the presence of two horned sibling Spiophanes species in the North East Pacific: S. hakaiensis Radashevsky & Pankova, n. sp. distributed from Alaska south to about Point Conception, and S. norrisi Meißner & Blank, 2009, distributed from San Francisco Bay south to Baja California Sur, Mexico. Spiophanes from South America, morphologically similar to S. norrisi, are suggested to belong to a new species. Molecular data also suggest the presence of two sibling species among the worms from northern Europe identified by morphology as S. kroyeri Grube, 1860. Worms from the Barents Sea and northern part of the North Sea are tentatively referred to as S. cf. kroyeri; worms from the northern and central parts of the North Sea and from the Bay of Biscay, northern Spain, are tentatively referred to as S. cf. cirrata M. Sars in G.O. Sars, 1872. Sequence data also show that S. duplex from California is genetically different from morphologically similar worms from South America. The South American worms are referred to resurrected S. soederstroemi Hartman, 1953 which was originally described from off Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and then considered as a junior synonym of S. duplex. Analysis of divergence times of Spiophanes lineages suggested that the origin of the most recent common ancestor of horned Spiophanes with metameric nuchal organs was around 11.1 mya (95% HPD: 5.1-19.0 mya) and that the divergence of the North Atlantic and North Pacific lineages was around 7.9 mya (95% HPD: 4.1-13.3 mya). The North Atlantic lineage was estimated to have diverged 4.8 mya (95% HPD: 2.2-8.6 mya), resulting in the origin of S. cf. bombyx and S. cf. convexus. The North Pacific lineage was estimated to have diverged first by the isolation and speciation of S. norrisi 1.7 mya (95% HPD: 2.3-1.0 mya), and then by the isolation and speciation of S. uschakowi and S. hakaiensis n. sp. 1.3 mya (95% HPD: 2.0-0.7 mya). The estimates place the divergences soon after maximum glacial period in the North Pacific (2.4-3.0 mya).","Radashevsky, Vasily I; Pankova, Victoria V; Malyar, Vasily V; Neretina, Tatyana V; Choi, Jin-Woo; Yum, Seungshic; Houbin, Céline",PLoS One,,571

The initial reaction to this news was to seek out scapegoats and blame individual authors, peer-reviewers, editors, and journals for wrong doing. This paper suggests that scapegoating a few individuals for faulty science is a myopic approach to the more profound problem with peer-review. Peer-review in its current limited form cannot be expected to adequately address the scope and complexity of large interdisciplinary science research collaboration, which is central in translational research. In addition, empirical studies on the effectiveness of traditional peer-review reveal its very real potential for bias and groupthink; as such, expectations regarding the capacity and effectiveness of the current peer review process are unrealistic. This paper proposes a new vision of peer-review in translational science that, on the one hand, would allow for early release of a manuscript to ensure expediency, whereas also creating a forum or a collective of various experts to actively comment, scrutinize, and even build on the research under review. The aim would be to not only generate open discussion and oversight respecting the quality and limitations of the research, but also to assess the extent and the means for that knowledge to translate into social benefit.","Smith, Elise M",Clinical and translational science (Online),,571

METHODS: Relevant articles were searched in PubMed and Scopus databases until December 2020. Studies evaluating the accuracy of seven different commercial molecular diagnostic tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 (Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test, Simplexa COVID-19 Direct, Abbott ID NOW COVID-19, Cobas SARS-CoV-2, Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay, Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2, and BioFire COVID-19 Test) were included. The quality of included studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 checklist. A bivariate random effects regression model was used for the meta-analyses. RESULTS: Meta-analysis of 12 included studies showed that the performances of commercial COVID-19 molecular in vitro diagnostic tests were high, with a summary sensitivity of 95.9% (95% CI 93.9 - 97.2%, I2 = 60.22%) and specificity of 97.2% (95% CI 95.5 - 98.3%, I2 = 56.66%). Among seven evaluated tests, the Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 and Simplexa COVID-19 Direct displayed lower sensitivity (91.6%, 95% CI 80.5 - 96.6% and 92%, 95% CI 86.2 - 95.5, respectively). CONCLUSION: In summary, all evaluated tests showed good accuracy. However, the slightly lower sensitivity observed in the Abbott ID Now COVID-19 and Simplexa COVID-19 Direct should be considered when deciding on a test platform.

In this study, we presented a new network-based algorithm for drug repositioning, called SAveRUNNER (Searching off-lAbel dRUg aNd NEtwoRk), which predicts drug-disease associations by quantifying the interplay between the drug targets and the disease-specific proteins in the human interactome via a novel network-based similarity measure that prioritizes associations between drugs and diseases locating in the same network neighborhoods. Specifically, we applied SAveRUNNER on a panel of 14 selected diseases with a consolidated knowledge about their disease-causing genes and that have been found to be related to COVID-19 for genetic similarity (i.e., SARS), comorbidity (e.g., cardiovascular diseases), or for their association to drugs tentatively repurposed to treat COVID-19 (e.g., malaria, HIV, rheumatoid arthritis). Focusing specifically on SARS subnetwork, we identified 282 repurposable drugs, including some the most rumored off-label drugs for COVID-19 treatments (e.g., chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, heparin), as well as a new combination therapy of 5 drugs (hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, remdesivir), actually used in clinical practice. Furthermore, to maximize the efficiency of putative downstream validation experiments, we prioritized 24 potential anti-SARS-CoV repurposable drugs based on their network-based similarity values. These top-ranked drugs include ACE-inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies (e.g., anti-IFNÎ³, anti-TNF&#945;, anti-IL12, anti-IL1ß, anti-IL6), and thrombin inhibitors. Finally, our findings were in-silico validated by performing a gene set enrichment analysis, which confirmed that most of the network-predicted repurposable drugs may have a potential treatment effect against human coronavirus infections.","Fiscon, Giulia; Conte, Federica; Farina, Lorenzo; Paci, Paola",PLoS Comput Biol,,571

228004,"Robust predictive model for Carriers, Infections and Recoveries (CIR): predicting death rates for CoVid-19 in Spain",2020-03-31,"With effective and safe COVID-19 vaccines beginning to be distributed across the United States, questions about who should receive the vaccine first have been the focus of public discussions. Yet, over the long-term, questions about the order of distribution will be displaced by questions about how to achieve high levels of vaccination rates. Historically, absent incentives or mandates, Americans have shown ambivalence, if not general antipathy, towards vaccinations, and vaccination rates have generally been low for many vaccines. There is evidence that vaccination requirements across educational settings are an effective policy instrument to increase vaccination rates. We administered a large national survey to assess American's attitudes towards vaccination requirements across three educational settings (daycare, K-12 schools, and universities) in general and for COVID-19 specifically. Partisanship, gender, race, rurality, and perceptions about the appropriate role schools should play in providing health services are substantive predictors of public opinion. While Americans generally support vaccination mandates across all three settings for both types of requirements, support is consistently and significantly lower for COVID19 requirements. The effect of partisanship is accentuated for COVID-19 requirements as compared to general requirements. Drop off in support between general and COVID-19 specific requirements are driven by partisanship, gender, political knowledge, rurality, and having children in the household. Nonetheless, mandates are supported by a majority of Americans. Assessing Americans' opinions of vaccination requirements in educational settings offers an important opportunity to explore the potential of mandates as policy instrument in the government's arsenal against COVID-19 and guide public policy on the issues.","Haeder, Simon F",Vaccine,,571

Especially after COVID-19, customer shift towards online services is expected to augment. This paper is an attempt to develop a scale for determinants of customer satisfaction amongst the existing users of online bus booking (e-enabled platform).Using e-SERVQUAL model by Parasuraman et al. (2005), a draft instrument was designed. Since online bus services also includes physical experience of services offered, Tangibility factor was added in the construct. The questionnaire was tested on a sample of existing users of online bus booking services (n=105). After checking for the adequate reliability score, Exploratory factor Analysis (EFA) was performed. It resulted into extraction of four factors such as Contact, Fulfilment, Privacy and Responsiveness, accounting for 50.5% of total variance explained. Validating this scale on a larger sample for generalisation of the results would be the future agenda of research. Development of India specific scale for e-enabled business models in public transports can be considered as one of the major contribution of this study. © 2021 Karadeniz Technical University.

It has saved millions of lives and prevented disease worldwide and millions more have been spared the permanent disabilities caused by diseases such as polio and the long-term morbidity caused by other diseases such as measles. Despite the compelling evidence of the public health and economic value of vaccines, vaccine hesitancy has become a growing concern globally. By calling into question the safety and efficacy of vaccines, vaccine hesitancy threatens the progress made in combating morbidity and mortality including efforts to introduce COVID-19 vaccines. This paper a) examines key factors that drive limited demand for vaccines and vaccine hesitancy, (b) highlights the role of demand promotion for immunization and of risk communication and community engagement to address those challenges, (c) discusses vaccine demand and hesitancy in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and (d) makes recommendations for public health policy and programming for the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccine and beyond.Recommendations include strengthen social listening and digital engagement to address the concerns of caregivers and healthcare professionals, improve the availability and use of social data for evidence-based programming, reinforce public trust in health institutions and service providers, mainstream demand for immunization, strengthen the communication competencies of health service providers, test and apply solutions based on behavioral insights to reinforce demand, engage regularly with local governments and local actors, and strengthen resilience and response capacities for diseases outbreaks and public health emergencies.","Obregon, Rafael; Mosquera, Mario; Tomsa, Sergiu; Chitnis, Ketan",J Health Commun,,571

Until recently, its treatment is mainly based on physical locations and meetings while being face to face. However, laser acupuncture tele-therapy approaches can significantly provide the patient with safety during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as changing the disorder's prognosis. Sixty patients were assigned randomly into 2 groups with 1:1 ratio. Patients in group A are treated remotely by laser acupuncture in addition to methotrexate and a tele-rehabilitation program in the form of aerobic exercise training. Patients in group B are treated by methotrexate and a tele-rehabilitation program in the form of aerobic exercise. There was a statistically significant difference in health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) pre- and post-treatment in group A (p < 0.05). The C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) inflammatory markers as well as the malondialdehyde (MDA) oxidative marker showed a significant reduction pre- and post-treatment in group A (p < 0.05). Additionally, there was a significant increase in the adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) antioxidant marker pre- and post-treatment in group A (p < 0.05). The comparison between groups A and B showed a statistically significant post-treatment difference in RAQoL, CRP, IL-6, ATP, and MDA in group A than group B. Considering the significant improvement that was found in the laser acupuncture group, it can be concluded that the use of laser acupuncture as adjunctive was effective in the treatment of elderly patients with RA.

We assessed antibody and T cell reactivity in convalescent COVID-19 patients and healthy donors sampled both prior to and during the pandemic. Healthy donors examined during the pandemic exhibited increased numbers of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, but no humoral response. Their probable exposure to the virus resulted in either asymptomatic infection without antibody secretion or activation of preexisting immunity. In convalescent patients, we observed a public and diverse T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, revealing T cell receptor (TCR) motifs with germline-encoded features. Bulk CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to the spike protein were mediated by groups of homologous TCRs, some of them shared across multiple donors. Overall, our results demonstrate that the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2, including the identified set of TCRs, can serve as a useful biomarker for surveying antiviral immunity.","Shomuradova, Alina S; Vagida, Murad S; Sheetikov, Savely A; Zornikova, Ksenia V; Kiryukhin, Dmitry; Titov, Aleksei; Peshkova, Iuliia O; Khmelevskaya, Alexandra; Dianov, Dmitry V; Malasheva, Maria; Shmelev, Anton; Serdyuk, Yana; Bagaev, Dmitry V; Pivnyuk, Anastasia; Shcherbinin, Dmitrii S; Maleeva, Alexandra V; Shakirova, Naina T; Pilunov, Artem; Malko, Dmitry B; Khamaganova, Ekaterina G; Biderman, Bella; Ivanov, Alexander; Shugay, Mikhail; Efimov, Grigory A",Immunity,,571
228755,Advanced Material Against Human (Including Covid-19) and Plant Viruses: Nanoparticles As a Feasible Strategy,2020,"Introduction:It is now well established that COVID-19 infection is associated with hypercoagulability especially in those with severe respiratory disease and higher degree of inflammation. We present an unusual case of pulmonary embolism (PE) with atypical symptoms in a COVID-19 survivor.Case Report:A 47-year-old African-American, non-smoker female with a history of hypertension and morbid obesity presented with sudden onset of dizziness associated with nausea and vomiting. The patient was in her usual state of health prior to the onset of symptoms. She described her dizziness as a sensation of room spinning. Review of systems was otherwise normal. She was in no acute distress, vital signs were within normal limits and oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Physical examination including the Dix-Hallpike maneuver was unremarkable. Laboratory investigations and EKG were normal. A CT angiography of the head and neck did not reveal any cerebral ischemia, however, it disclosed findings concerning PE. A CT angiography of the chest demonstrated bilateral emboli with filling defects confirming PE. Echocardiogram was normal. The patient did not have any risk factors for PE like recent immobilization, travel, surgery, use of oral contraceptives or hormonal therapy, malignancy and personal or family history of thromboembolic disorders. Of note, six months ago she was tested positive for COVID-19 with mild symptoms which did not require hospitalization. COVID-19 test during this admission was negative, but D-dimer was not obtained. In the absence of any other plausible etiology of dizziness, her symptoms were attributed to atypical presentation of PE. She was treated with heparin and discharged on oral anticoagulation therapy with apixaban for one year. Discussion:Although there are several proposed hypotheses, the exact pathogenesis of hypercoagulability in COVID-19 infection is unclear. Thus far, the reported cases of PE as a complication of COVID-19 infection presented within six weeks of disease onset. Our patient developed bilateral PE six months post infection, which was not severe enough to require hospitalization, in the absence of any other risk factors for PE. More recent studies suggest that patients with a BMI greater than 30 kg per meter square, like our patient, have a greater propensity to develop PE but in the setting of severe disease. Physicians should be cognizant of this clinical entity and have a high index of suspicion for PE in patients with prior COVID-19 infection irrespective of the timeline and disease severity especially in those with atypical presentation like our patient.","Jamil, A.; Syeda, A.; Shyam, V.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,571

Genomic-inspired isolation facilitated the identification of eight amphiphilic siderophores, saccharochelins A-H (1-8), from a rare marine-derived Saccharothrix species. Saccharochelins feature a series of fatty acyl groups appended to the same tetrapeptide skeleton. With the help of gene disruption and heterologous expression, we identified the saccharochelin biosynthetic pathway. The diversity of saccharochelins originates from the flexible specificity of the starter condensation (CS) domain at the beginning of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) toward various fatty acyl substrates. Saccharochelins showed cytotoxicity against several human tumor cell lines, with IC50 values ranging from 2.3 to 17 µM. Additionally, the fatty acid side chains of the saccharochelins remarkably affected the cytotoxicity, suggesting changing the N-terminal acyl groups of lipopeptides may be a promising approach to produce more potent derivatives.","Shen, Qiyao; Dai, Guangzhi; Ravichandran, Vinothkannan; Liu, Yang; Zhong, Lin; Sui, Haiyan; Ren, Xiangmei; Jiao, Nianzhi; Zhang, Youming; Zhou, Haibo; Bian, Xiaoying",J. nat. prod,,571

The current study investigated a method to induce positive involuntary imagery in daily life, which would allow direct testing of its impact. An unselected student sample (N = 80) completed a single session of a positive imagery cognitive bias modification (CBM) paradigm, which involved listening to and imagining brief positive imagery scripts. Participants then recorded any involuntary memories of the imagined training scenarios in a three-day diary before returning to the lab for a follow-up assessment. Participants were randomised to imagine the scenarios in either an emotionally involved or emotionally detached manner, providing a test of the role of emotion in the subsequent experience of involuntary memories. Participants reported experiencing involuntary memories of the training scenarios in their daily life, but the number recorded did not differ between the experimental conditions. Exploratory analyses suggested that more vivid imagery and recall testing were associated with a greater number of involuntary memories. The study highlights the potential of the imagery CBM paradigm to further our understanding of the functions and potential importance of positive involuntary mental imagery in daily life.","Blackwell, Simon E; Dooley, Daniela; Würtz, Felix; Woud, Marcella L; Margraf, Jürgen",Memory,,571

Diabetes (mostly type 2 diabetes mellitus, T2DM) and hyperglycemia are among the major comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 leading to poor outcomes. Reports show that patients with diabetes and COVID-19 are at an increased risk for developing severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and death. Here we explore potential mechanistic links that could explain the observed higher morbidity and mortality in this patient population. Patients with T2DM have an underlying increased level of inflammation associated with obesity and insulin resistance in addition to other comorbidities including hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, and being older. We review evidence that T2DM with hyperglycemia are among factors that lead to elevated expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in lungs and other tissues; ACE2 is the cellular ""receptor"" and port of viral entry. The preexisting chronic inflammation with augmented inflammatory response to the infection and the increasing viral load leads to extreme systemic immune response (""cytokine storm"") that is strongly associated with increased severity of COVID-19. Based on the available evidence, it is recommended by a panel of experts that safe but stringent control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipids be carried out in patients with T2DM, measures that could potentially serve to decrease the severity of COVID-19 should these patients contract the viral infection. Once the infection occurs, then attention should be directed to proper glycemic control with use of insulin and frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels.","Rajpal, Aman; Rahimi, Leili; Ismail-Beigi, Faramarz",J. diabetes (Online),,571

This would, in turn, prevent over-reliance on donors, as a way to get Zimbabwe back on its feet as the ‘once’ bread basket of Africa. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Kanonhuwa, T.; Toriro, P.; Chirisa, I.",Advances in 21st Century Human Settlements,,571
231896,Optimal Containment Control Strategy of the Second Phase of the COVID-19 Lockdown in Morocco,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The world is currently challenged to handle this pandemic. The common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. There are few reports on the association of SARS-CoV-2 with ocular abnormalities including conjunctivitis. We report a case of a 54-year-old woman who presented solely with conjunctivitis subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19. A lack of full history of her travel abroad was another issue leading to a delay in evaluating her COVID-19 status that increased the infection risk to her managing team. Thus, primary care practitioners should be suspicious of this atypical feature of COVID-19, thus enabling us to identify such patients at entry points. Maintaining safety measures while managing patients is also crucial.","Ying, Ng Ying; Idris, Nur Suhaila; Muhamad, Rosediani; Ahmad, Imran",,,571

The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on patients and caregivers of IBD patients regarding their concerns and worries related to own health, access to treatment and availability of factor concentrates and their experiences related to medical care. METHODS: Multicentre, cross-sectional study evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on mental health of IBD patients. An ad hoc questionnaire was developed and sent to 586 patients/caregivers with haemophilia A, haemophilia B and VWD type III. The survey included information on demographic and clinical data, needs, concerns and experiences regarding medical care during COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 355 of the IBD-Group (200 patients, 155 caregivers) completed the survey (61.7% response rate). Most patients suffered from haemophilia A (73.8%) and were severely affected (64.7%). Eleven patients were in quarantine due to suspected COVID-19; none had symptoms. One quarter worried (very) strongly about getting the coronavirus, 71.3% asked themselves what will happen to them when they will get COVID-19, 40.1% felt unchanged, and 18.9% worried about delivery difficulties of their IBD treatment product. In 52.8%, medical appointments were postponed. Significant differences between caregivers and patients were found in most aspects. DISCUSSION: The IBD patients affected by a chronic disorder have particular thoughts and worries regarding COVID-19. Haemophilia specialists should be committed to address these concerns and guarantee treatment despite containment strategies.","von Mackensen, Sylvia; Halimeh, Susan; Siebert, Manuela; Wermes, Cornelia; Hassenpflug, Wolf; Holstein, Katharina; Olivieri, Martin",Haemophilia,,571

Patients with moderate and critical COVID-19 clinical manifestations were separated as Group 1 (moderate cases, n = 10, treated conventionally), Group 2 (critical cases, n = 10, treated conventionally), and Group 3 (critical cases, n = 10, treated conventionally plus MSCs transplantation therapy of three consecutive doses on treatment days 0, 3, and 6, (as 3 × 106 cells/kg, intravenously). The treatment mechanism of action was investigated with evaluation markers of the cytokine storm, via biochemical parameters, levels of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, analyses of tissue regeneration via the levels of growth factors, apoptosis markers, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases, and granzyme-B, and by the assessment of the immunomodulatory effects via total oxidant/antioxidant status markers and the levels of lymphocyte subsets. In the assessment of the overall mortality rates of all the cases, six patients in Group-2 and three patients in Group-3 died, and there was no loss in Group-1. Proinflammatory cytokines IFNÎ³, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-2, IL-12, anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10, IL-13, IL-1ra, and growth factors TGF-ß, VEGF, KGF, and NGF levels were found to be significant in Group-3. When Group-2 and Group-3 were compared, serum ferritin, fibrinogen and CRP levels in Group-3 had significantly decreased. CD45 +, CD3 +, CD4 +, CD8 +, CD19 +, HLA-DR +, and CD16 + / CD56 + levels were evaluated. In the statistical comparison of the groups, significance was only determined in respect of neutrophils. The results demonstrated the positive systematic and cellular effects of MSCs application on critically ill COVID-19 patients in a versatile way. This effect plays an important role in curing and reducing mortality in critically ill patients.","Adas, G; Cukurova, Z; Yasar, K Kart; Yilmaz, R; Isiksacan, N; Kasapoglu, P; Yesilbag, Z; Koyuncu, I D; Karaoz, E",Cell Transplant,,571

Despite the focus on reducing mortality by preventing the spread of the virus, patients have died due to several other complications of the illness. The understanding of pathological mechanisms and their implications is continuously evolving. A number of symptoms occur in these patients due to the involvement of various endocrine glands. These clinical presentations went largely unnoticed during the first outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003. A few of these derangements continued during the convalescence phase and sometimes occurred after recovery. Similar pathological and biochemical changes are being reported with the novel coronavirus disease outbreak in 2020. In this review, we focus on these endocrine changes that have been reported in both SARS coronavirus and SARS coronavirus-2. As we battle the pandemic, it becomes imperative to address these underlying endocrine disturbances that are contributing towards or predicting mortality of these patients.","Agarwal, Shubham; Agarwal, Sanjeev Kumar",Postgrad Med J,,571

We described a clinical pathway for patients who needed emergency brain surgery and determined whether differences in the surgery preparation process caused by COVID-19 screening affected clinical outcomes. METHODS: During the COVID-19 period, patients in need of emergency brain surgery in our institution were managed using a novel standardized pathway designed for COVID-19 screening. We conducted a retrospective review of patients who were hospitalized through the emergency room and underwent emergency brain surgery. A total of 32 patients who underwent emergency brain surgery from February 1 to June 30, 2020 were included in the COVID-19 group, and 65 patients who underwent surgery from February 1 to June 30, 2019 were included in the pre-COVID-19 group. The baseline characteristics, disease severity indicators, time intervals of emergency processes, and clinical outcomes of the two groups were compared. Subgroup analysis was performed between the immediate surgery group and the semi-elective surgery group during the COVID-19 period. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics and severity indicators between the pre-COVID-19 group and COVID-19 group. The time interval to skin incision was significantly increased in the COVID-19 group (P = 0.027). However, there were no significant differences in the clinical outcomes between the two groups. In subgroup comparison, the time interval to skin incision was shorter in the immediate surgery group during the COVID-19 period compared with the pre-COVID-19 group (P = 0.040). The screening process did not significantly increase the time interval to classification and admission for immediate surgery. The time interval to surgery initiation was longer in the COVID-19 period due to the increased time interval in the semi-elective surgery group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We proposed a clinical pathway for the preoperative screening of COVID-19 in patients requiring emergency brain surgery. No significant differences were observed in the clinical outcomes before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The protocol we described showed acceptable results during this pandemic.","Lee, Shin Heon; Jang, Ju Sung; Chung, Jin Won; Kwon, Jeong Taik; Park, Yong Sook",J Korean Med Sci,,571

Our objective was to study to what extend mandatory quarantine imposed due to COVID-19 had affected behavioral symptoms in subjects with dementia after the first 8 weeks of quarantine. We invited family members to participate in a questionnaire survey. The sample consisted of family caregivers (n = 119) of persons with AD or related dementia living at home. We designed a visual analog scale to test the level of the burden of care of family members. Items inquired in the survey included type and setting (home or day care center) of rehabilitation services (physical/occupational/cognitive rehabilitation) and change in psychotropic medication and in behavioral symptoms that subjects with dementia experienced before and during the epidemic. Characteristics of people with dementia and their caregivers were analyzed with descriptive statistics using the chi-square tests, p &lt; 0.01 was considered significant. Results: The sample included older adults with dementia. Mean age: 81.16 (±7.03), 35% of the subjects had more than 85 years of age. Diagnosess were 67% Alzheimer´s dementia and 26% mixed Alzheimer´s disease (AD). Stages were 34.5% mild cases, 32% intermediate stage, and 33% severe cases as per Clinical dementia Rating score. In 67% of the sample, a family member was the main caregiver. Important findings were increased anxiety (43% of the sample), insomnia (28% of the subjects), depression (29%), worsening gait disturbance (41%), and increase use of psychotropics to control behavioral symptoms. When we compared the frequency of behavioral symptoms within each dementia group category, we found that anxiety, depression, and insomnia were more prevalent in subjects with mild dementia compared to subjects with severe dementia. We analyzed the type and pattern of use of rehabilitation services before and during the isolation period, and we observed that, as a rule, rehabilitation services had been discontinued in most subjects due to the quarantine. We concluded from our analysis that during COVID-19 epidemic there was a deterioration of behavioral symptoms in our population of elderly dementia subjects living in the community. Perhaps, our findings are related to a combination of social isolation, lack of outpatient rehabilitation services, and increased stress of family caregivers. It is necessary to develop a plan of action to help dementia subjects deal with the increased stress that this epidemic imposed on them.","Cohen, Gabriela; Russo, María Julieta; Campos, Jorge A.; Allegri, Ricardo F.",Front.

234015,Planning for COVID-19 safe aerial firefighting operations,2020,"Clupeiformes (herring, sardines, shad, anchovies and allies) are a globally distributed clade with nearly 400 marine, freshwater, and diadromous species. Although best known as filter feeding fishes that form large schools, this group occupies a diverse array of trophic guilds and habitats. Theory suggests that species richness in clades is modulated by ecological limits, which results in diversity-dependent clade growth, a pattern that most clades exhibit. As a trans-marine/freshwater clade that has undergone repeated transitions between marine and freshwaters, Clupeiformes are an excellent system for investigating the interplay between ecological diversity and macroevolutionary dynamics. In this study we review the systematics of Clupeiformes and explore discordance in phylogenetic relationships and divergence times between mitochondrial and nuclear loci. We then use comparative methods to test whether ecological limits regulate diversity in Clupeiformes. We find discordance in phylogenetic relationships at various taxonomic scales, but also considerable agreement between genomes. Our results suggest that trans-marine/freshwater clades are able to circumvent ecological limits on clade growth at regional, but not on local scales. Our study demonstrates that phylogenies are a critical link between ecology and macroevolutionary dynamics, and suggests habitat transitions can play a key role in shaping diversity patterns, particularly in the neotropics.(AU)","Bloom, Devin D; Egan, Joshua P",Neotrop. ichthyol,,571

We conducted this study to compare the trends of domperidone prescription in pediatrics before and after the MFDS safety warning. MATERIALS: This study included patients < 18 years old who used national health insurance services within the year 2011 and the year 2016, sampled from Health Insurance Review Agency data. METHODS: We analyzed domperidone prescribing patterns including prescribed daily dosage, maximum period of continuous prescription, and number and types of co-prescribed medications and compared two different years pre and post safety warning. RESULTS: A total of 16,614 pediatric patients (1.74%) received domperidone prescriptions in 2011, and 11,317 patients (1.23%) in 2016. The probability of receiving at least one prescription in 2016 has been reduced by 30% compared to 2011. Gastritis was the most common indication in both years. The number of prescriptions containing a maximum daily dosage of over 30 mg was significantly lower in 2016. In the same time period, the number of cases with a maximum continuous prescription period of more than 7 days significantly decreased (p < 0.001). In addition, from 2011 to 2016, comorbid diseases of domperidone-treated patients were similar, but the number of co-prescriptions of interacting medication to domperidone decreased (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: After the 2014 safety letter was released, the pattern of prescribing domperidone in pediatrics has enhanced drug safety for children in terms of frequency of prescriptions, maximum duration of domperidone use, and the prescription of drugs interacting with domperidone.","Rhew, Kiyon; Han, Nayoung; Goodin, Amie J; Oh, Jung Mi",Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,,571

235625,60‐5: Invited Paper: Display Technology Responds to COVID‐19 Challenges,2021,"We estimate the effect of the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic on racial animus, as measured by Google searches and Twitter posts including a commonly used anti-Asian racial slur. Our empirical strategy exploits the plausibly exogenous variation in the timing of the first Covid-19 diagnosis across regions in the United States. We find that the first local diagnosis leads to an immediate increase in racist Google searches and Twitter posts, with the latter mainly coming from existing Twitter users posting the slur for the first time. This increase could indicate a rise in future hate crimes, as we document a strong correlation between the use of the slur and anti-Asian hate crimes using historic data. Moreover, we find that the rise in the animosity is directed at Asians rather than other minority groups and is stronger on days when the connection between the disease and Asians is more salient, as proxied by President Trump's tweets mentioning China and Covid-19 at the same time. In contrast, the negative economic impact of the pandemic plays little role in the initial increase in racial animus. Our results suggest that de-emphasizing the connection between the disease and a particular racial group can be effective in curbing current and future racial animus.","Lu, Runjing; Sheng, Yanying",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.01448v1.pdf,571
235869,A Cross-Regional Analysis of the COVID-19 Spread during the 2020 Italian Vacation Period: Results from Three Computational Models Are Compared,2020,"In the Catholic world, pilgrimages and other devotional rituals are often undertaken to foster healing and well-being Thus, shrines dedicated to saints are particularly relevant in times of pandemic Pilgrimage to the shrines associated with 20th century Italian stigmatic, St Padre Pio of Pietrelcina, known as one of the Catholic world’s most popular saints, is particularly informed by this notion, as Pio is understood as a healing saint thanks to the spiritual and corporal works of mercy that marked his ministry during his lifetime, as well as belief in the miraculous nature of his relics Pio’s hometown of Pietrelcina and his shrine at San Giovanni Rotondo boast millions of religious tourists each year, especially from Italy, Ireland and the Philippines—many of whom come with the expressed purpose of healing their ailments, praying for others who are suffering, or rendering thanks for healing received through the saint’s intercession The current COVID-19 crisis has also seen the faithful turn to Pio for the alleviation of this new form of suffering This paper thus argues that Padre Pio can be considered a ‘pandemic saint’—one to whom the faithful pray specifically to alleviate their suffering and that of the community, and who serves as a model for moral behaviour, during a pandemic First, employing ethnohistorical analysis and a close reading of Pio’s writings, I trace the development of Pio’s ‘ministry of mercy,’ which is predicated on the Christological ideal of suffering as a proxy for others In particular, I show that Pio’s stigmata experience in 1918, and the meteoric rise of devotion and pilgrimage to him, was a partial result of the world’s last great pandemic, the Spanish Flu Second, drawing on over a decade of ethnographic research at Pio’s shrines, interviews and analysis of news media during the current COVID-19 pandemic, and an examination of Pope Francis’ public discourses on both Pio and the coronavirus outbreak of 2020, I argue that Pio can also be considered a ‘pandemic saint’ for COVID-19 Third, the paper ends with an update on the impacts of COVID-19 on the main Italian shrines to Pio, which despite their importance and relevance for alleviating pandemic suffering, were closed to mass religious tourism and pilgrimage during Italy’s harsh quarantine in spring 2020, and are now beginning to contemplate new ways to serve the faithful and promote Pio as a pandemic saint in a post-COVID world © International Journal of Religious Tourism and Pilgrimage","Di Giovine, M.

236040,COVID-19 and European Banks,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has acted as a catalyst for the development and adoption of a broad range of remote monitoring technologies (RMTs) in health care delivery. It is important to demonstrate how these technologies were implemented during the early stages of this pandemic to identify their application and barriers to adoption, particularly among vulnerable populations. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this knowledge synthesis was to present the range of RMTs used in delivering care to patients with COVID-19 and to identify perceived benefits of and barriers to their use. The review placed a special emphasis on health equity considerations. METHODS: A rapid review of published research was conducted using Embase, MEDLINE, and QxMD for records published from the inception of COVID-19 (December 2019) to July 6, 2020. Synthesis involved content analysis of reported benefits of and barriers to the use of RMTs when delivering health care to patients with COVID-19, in addition to health equity considerations. RESULTS: Of 491 records identified, 48 publications that described 35 distinct RMTs were included in this review. RMTs included use of existing technologies (eg, videoconferencing) and development of new ones that have COVID-19-specific applications. Content analysis of perceived benefits generated 34 distinct codes describing advantages of RMTs, mapped to 10 themes overall. Further, 52 distinct codes describing barriers to use of RMTs were mapped to 18 themes. Prominent themes associated with perceived benefits included a lower burden of care (eg, for hospitals, health care practitioners; 28 records), reduced infection risk (n=33), and support for vulnerable populations (n=14). Prominent themes reflecting barriers to use of RMTs included equity-related barriers (eg, affordability of technology for users, poor internet connectivity, poor health literacy; n=16), the need for quality ""best practice"" guidelines for use of RMTs in clinical care (n=12), and the need for additional resources to develop and support new technologies (n=11). Overall, 23 of 48 records commented on equity characteristics that stratify health opportunities and outcomes, including general characteristics that vary over time (eg, age, comorbidities; n=17), place of residence (n=11), and socioeconomic status (n=7). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this rapid review highlight the breadth of RMTs being used to monitor and inform treatment of COVID-19, the potential benefits of using these technologies, and existing barriers to their use. Results can be used to prioritize further efforts in the implementation of RMTs (eg, developing ""best practice"" guidelines for use of RMTs and generating strategies to improve equitable access for marginalized populations).","Houlding, Elizabeth; Mate, Kedar K V; Engler, Kim; Ortiz-Paredes, David; Pomey, Marie-Pascale; Cox, Joseph; Hijal, Tarek; Lebouché, Bertrand",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,571

Forecasting has been one of the most powerful statistical methods employed the world over in various disciplines for detecting and analyzing trends and predicting future outcomes based on which timely and mitigating actions can be undertaken. To that end, several statistical methods and machine learning techniques have been harnessed depending upon the analysis desired and the availability of data. Historically speaking, most predictions thus arrived at have been short term and country-specific in nature. In this work, multimodel machine learning technique is called EAMA for forecasting Covid-19 related parameters in the long-term both within India and on a global scale have been proposed. This proposed EAMA hybrid model is well-suited to predictions based on past and present data. For this study, two datasets from the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare of India and Worldometers, respectively, have been exploited. Using these two datasets, long-term data predictions for both India and the world have been outlined, and observed that predicted data being very similar to real-time values. The experiment also conducted for statewise predictions of India and the countrywise predictions across the world and it has been included in the Appendix.","Mohan, Senthilkumar; A, John; Abugabah, Ahed; M, Adimoolam; Kumar Singh, Shubham; Kashif Bashir, Ali; Sanzogni, Louis",,,571
236742,The impact of COVID-19 control measures on social contacts and transmission in Kenyan informal settlements,2020,"This paper studies whether and how differently projected information about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic affects individuals' prosocial behavior and expectations on future outcomes. We conducted an online experiment with British participants (N=961) when the UK introduced its first lockdown and the outbreak was on its growing stage. Participants were primed with either the environmental or economic consequences (i.e., negative primes), or the environmental or economic benefits (i.e., positive primes) of the pandemic, or with neutral information. We measured priming effects on an incentivized take-and-give dictator game and on participants' expectations about future environmental quality and economic growth. Our results show that primes affect participants' expectations, but not their prosociality. In particular, participants primed with environmental consequences hold a more pessimistic view on future environmental quality, while those primed with economic benefits are more optimistic about future economic growth. Instead, the positive environmental prime and the negative economic prime do not influence expectations. Our results offer insights into how information affects behavior and expectations during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Fanghella, Valeria; Vu, Thi-Thanh-Tam; Mittone, Luigi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.13538v1.pdf,571

Diagnostic tests for covid-19 fall into two main categories: molecular tests that detect viral RNA, and serological tests that detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a molecular test, has become the gold standard for diagnosis of covid-19; however, this test has many limitations that include potential false negative results, changes in diagnostic accuracy over the disease course, and precarious availability of test materials. Serological tests have generated substantial interest as an alternative or complement to RT-PCR and other Nucleic acid tests in the diagnosis of acute infection, as some might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care. A clear advantage of these tests over RT-PCR is that they can identify individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2, even if they never underwent testing while acutely ill. Many serological tests for covid-19 have become available in a short period, including some marketed for use as rapid, point-of-care tests. The pace of development has, however, exceeded that of rigorous evaluation, and important uncertainty about test accuracy remains.","Sidiq, Zeeshan; Hanif, M.; Dwivedi, Kaushal Kumar; Chopra, K.

(Symposium: Economics and epidemiology.),2020,"BACKGROUND: In the current literature, there is a growing evidence that supports the significant role of inflammation in the progression of viral pneumonia, including patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). AIM: The present study aimed to investigate the predictive value of C-reactive protein/albumin ratio (CAR) for in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study included the data of 275 consecutive COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in a referral pandemic center. The CAR ratio was obtained by dividing the CRP level with albumin level. The study population was divided into tertiles (T1, T2, and T3) according to their admission CAR values. The endpoint of the study was a composite outcome of in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: During the in-hospital course, 33 (12%) patients died. The patients classified into T3 group had significantly higher CAR compared those classified into T2 and T1 groups. After the adjustment for the confounders, T3 group had 8.2 (95% CI: 4.2-48.1) times higher rates of in-hospital mortality compared to T1 group (the reference group) in a logistic regression model using CAR values. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the predictive value of CAR for in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Güney, Basak Çakir; Tastan, Yesim Önal; Dogantekin, Betül; Serindag, Zeliha; Yeniçeri, Murat; Çiçek, Vedat; Kiliç, Sahhan; Seker, Mehmet; Çinar, Tufan; Hayiroglu, Mert Ilker; Kaplan, Mustafa",Arch. med. res,,571

As the need to reduce COVID-19 transmission, many clinic providers have converted their in-person visits to video or phone visits. Our endocrinology clinic initiated tele visits early on when the pandemic had just started. Telemedicine may help with patient’s compliance by decreasing various burdens. Some studies show that patients and providers hope telemedicine will continue after the crisis. In this study we evaluated benefits and challenges of telemedicine in our endocrinology clinic. Patients who had a telemedicine endocrinology visit after informed consent were surveyed on 10 questions regarding benefits and limitations of the tele visits compared to the clinic visit. Patient also responded if they want to continue with telehealth after COVID-19 pandemic. Providers also were surveyed about the benefits and limitations of telemedicine and responded if they want to continue with telemedicine after pandemic. We also analyzed no-show rate from January 2020 through May 2020 for 6 weeks before and after the implementation of telemedicine. Among 109 patients who were interviewed 65% declared that they would like to continue with telemedicine after pandemic. Total of 42% of patients prefer video visit and 37% prefer phone calls. Among Interviewers 45% report benefit of spending less time, however 54% stat the time of meeting, itself was about the same. 54% believe they spent less money with telemedicine. 37% of interviewers report no limitation for telehealth while 25% report connection difficulty. 63% of patients state they do not have any difficulty traveling to the hospital. 90% of the patients declare all their question and concerns were responded and 77% stated the quality of care with telemedicine is almost the same via clinic visit. Among providers 75% want to continue telehealth after COVID-19 pandemic. 50% of providers mention patient satisfaction and 25% notice time saving as benefits. 46% of the providers mention lack of physical exam and 40% mention technology connection as the limitation for video visit. 60% of providers believe lack of exam is the limitation of phone visit. 87% of the providers believe the quality of care via phone is not like in clinic visit while 75% of the providers believe the quality of care is similar in video visit compare to in clinic visits. No show rate decreased from 30% to 27% after the implementation of telemedicine in 6 weeks prior and after pandemic. Endocrinology clinic has significant number of patients who need long term close follow up for medication adjustments, symptom checks and counseling. Given patients and providers satisfaction rate, telemedicine can be incorporated as part of regular clinic visits after the Covid crisis ends.

METHODS: We examined early responses of IL-37, a powerful anti-inflammatory cytokine, in 254 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients prior to any clinical intervention and determined its correlation with clinical prognosis. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes elevation of plasma IL-37. Higher early IL-37 responses correlated with earlier viral RNA negative conversion, chest CT image improvement and cough relief, consequently resulted in earlier hospital discharge. Further assays showed that higher IL-37 was associated with lower IL-6 and IL-8 and higher IFN-&#945; and facilitated biochemical homeostasis. Low IL-37 responses predicted severe clinical prognosis in combination with IL-8 and CRP. In addition, we observed that IL-37 administration was able to attenuate lung inflammation and alleviate respiratory tissue damage in human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)-transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found that IL-37 plays a protective role by antagonizing inflammatory responses while retaining type I IFN, thereby maintaining the functionalities of vital organs. IL-37, IL-8 and CRP might be formulated as a precise prediction model for screening severe clinical cases and have good value in clinical practice.","Li, Ang; Ling, Yun; Song, Zhigang; Cheng, Xiaobo; Ding, Longfei; Jiang, Rendi; Fu, Weihui; Liu, Yan; Hu, Huiliang; Yuan, Songhua; Chen, Jian; Zhu, Cuisong; Fan, Jun; Wang, Jing; Jin, Yanling; Zhang, Miaomiao; Zhu, Lingyan; Sun, Peng; Zhang, Linxia; Qin, Ran; Zhang, Wei; Qiu, Chenli; Shen, Yinzhong; Zhang, Lin; Shi, Zhengli; Zhao, Chen; Zhu, Tongyu; Lu, Hongzhou; Zhang, Xiaoyan; Xu, Jianqing",J. infect. dis,,571

For eukaryotic membranes, for instance, rather than using only zwitterionic phospholipids there is now a trend to employ mixtures to simulate the lipid rafts known to be relevant for various cellular processes. In this study, we demonstrate that effects from chitosans on Langmuir monolayers are considerably higher if lipid raft compositions (ternary mixtures of dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline (DPPC), sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol) are used. Significantly, measurable effects on the surface pressure isotherms start at 10-6 mg mL-1 for chitosans in lipid rafts, to be compared with 10-2 mg mL-1 for neat dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC). This applies to both a commercial chitosan and chitosans soluble at physiological pH. Incorporation of these chitosans in the raft monolayers was confirmed in polarization-modulated infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) experiments, where both the tail groups and headgroups were found to interact with chitosan. Since the effects on membrane models may be observed at such small concentrations for chitosans and probably other molecules, some studies may have to be revisited where neat phospholipids should be replaced by lipid raft compositions.","Pereira, Andressa R; Fiamingo, Anderson; de O Pedro, Rafael; Campana-Filho, Sérgio P; Miranda, Paulo B; Oliveira, Osvaldo N",Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,,571

Digital divide is any uneven distribution in Information and Communications Technologies between people. AIMS: The purpose of this work was to describe the digital divide of a population of patients with dementia contacted by telemedicine during Italian lockdown for COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: One hundred eight patients with cognitive impairment were contacted by video call to perform a telemedicine neurological evaluation. Information on patients and caregivers attending the televisit were recorded. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients connected with neurologist (successful televisit, 68.5%) and 34 patients were not able to perform televisit and were contacted by phone (failed televisit, 31.5%). No significant differences were observed among the two groups concerning age, gender, and education, but the prevalence of successful televisit was higher in the presence of younger caregivers: televisits performed in the presence of subjects of younger generation (sons and grandsons) had a successful rate higher (86% successful, 14% failed) than the group without younger generation caregiver (49% successful, 51% failed). This difference is mainly due to the ability of technological use among younger people. DISCUSSION: The most impacting factors on digital divide in our population are the social support networks and the experience with the technology: the presence of a digital native caregiver. The COVID-19 pandemic is unmasking an emerging form of technology-related social inequalities: political and community interventions are needed to support the most socially vulnerable population and prevent social health inequalities.","Arighi, Andrea; Fumagalli, Giorgio Giulio; Carandini, Tiziana; Pietroboni, Anna Margherita; De Riz, Milena Alessandra; Galimberti, Daniela; Scarpini, Elio",Neurol Sci,,571

This study aims to estimate the prevalence of food insufficiency (often the most extreme form of food insecurity), the correlates of food insufficiency, and the associations between food insufficiency and symptoms of poor mental health in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from 63,674 participants of the U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey were collected and analyzed in 2020. Multiple Poisson regression models were used to estimate associations with food insufficiency. RESULTS: Food insufficiency rose from 8.1% to 10.0% from March to June 2020. Factors associated with food insufficiency included lower age, Black/African American or Latinx race/ethnicity, being unmarried, larger household size, recent employment loss, income below the federal poverty line, and lower education (all p<0.001). Food insufficiency was independently associated with all symptoms of poor mental health, adjusting for socioeconomic and demographic factors (adjusted RRs ranged from 1.16 to 1.42, all p<0.001). The association between food insufficiency and poor mental health was attenuated among people who received free groceries or meals. CONCLUSIONS: Food insufficiency has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and affects vulnerable populations, placing individuals at higher risk for symptoms of poor mental health. Particularly in the current crisis, clinicians should regularly screen patients for food insufficiency and mental health outcomes as well as provide support in accessing appropriate resources.","Nagata, Jason M; Ganson, Kyle T; Whittle, Henry J; Chu, Jonathan; Harris, Orlando O; Tsai, Alexander C; Weiser, Sheri D",Am. j. prev. med,,571

239753,Research towards treating COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the present study was to describe the characteristics of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) linked to self-medication that were notified to the French Pharmacovigilance Database (FPVD) during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 first wave. The secondary objective was to compare the characteristics of these ADRs in 2020 with those notified during the same calendar period a year previously Material and methods: We analyzed ADRs recorded in the FPVD between March 15th and May 31st, 2020 vs. the same dates in 2019. Only ADRs linked to self-medication were analyzed. Descriptive statistics were used to obtain an overview of the types and characteristics of these ADRs. Results Of 3114 ADRs notified to the FPVD during the COVID-19 period in 2020, 114 (3.7%) were linked to self-medication. The equivalent proportion in 2019 was 1.6% (113 out of 7097). Half of the ADRs notified in 2020 were ""serious"". The median age of affected patients was 30.5, and 22% of the ADRs concerned children. Of the 114 ADRs linked to self-medication, 107 (66%) were for prescription-only drugs. The three mostly frequently suspected ATC classes were analgesics, psycholeptics, and antibacterials for systemic use. The most frequent ADRs were general disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and nervous system disorders. The main difference between the non-COVID-19 period and the COVID-19 period was the higher proportion of medication errors during the latter. Conclusion The present study is the first to have reported on ADRs linked to self-medication and notified during a COVID-19 outbreak. Further studies of self-medication patterns and their consequences in a pandemic context are mandatory and effective information on medication use (including self-medication and its dangers) during a pandemic is essential.","Gras, Marion; Gras-Champel, Valérie; Moragny, Julien; Delaunay, Paul; Laugier, Delphine; Masmoudi, Kamel; Liabeuf, Sophie",Ann. pharm. fr,,571
239754,Research towards treating COVID-19,2020,"Since the end of 2019, a life-threatening infectious disease (coronavirus disease 2019: COVID-19) has spread globally, and numerous victims have been reported. In particular, older persons tend to suffer more severely when infected with a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and have higher case mortality rates; additionally, outbreaks frequently occur in hospitals and long-term care facilities where most of the residents are older persons. Unfortunately, it has been stated that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a medical collapse in some countries, resulting in the depletion of medical resources, such as ventilators, and triage based on chronological age. Furthermore, as some COVID-19 cases show a rapid deterioration of clinical symptoms and accordingly, the medical and long-term care staff cannot always confirm the patient's values and wishes in time, we are very concerned as to whether older patients are receiving the medical and long-term care services that they wish for. It was once again recognized that it is vital to implement advance care planning as early as possible before suffering from COVID-19. To this end, in August 2020, the Japan Geriatrics Society announced ethical recommendations for medical and long-term care for older persons and emphasized the importance of conducting advance care planning at earlier stages.

239769,The long and deadly road: the covid pandemic and Indian migrants,2021,"Objective: To examine countries' engagement with the health impacts of climate change in their formal statements to intergovernmental organizations, and the factors driving engagement. Methods: We obtained the texts of countries' annual statements in United Nations (UN) general debates from 2000 to 2019 and their nationally determined contributions at the Paris Agreement in 2016. To measure countries' engagement, we used a keyword-in-context text search with relevant search terms to count the total number of references to the relationship of health to climate change. We used a machine learning model (random forest predictions) to identify the most important country-level predictors of engagement. The predictors included political and economic factors, health outcomes, climate change-related variables and membership of political negotiating groups in the UN. Findings: For both UN general debate statements and nationally determined contributions, low- and middle-income countries discussed the health impacts of climate change much more than did high-income countries. The most important predictors of engagement were health outcomes (infant mortality, maternal deaths, life expectancy), countries' income levels (gross domestic product per capita), and fossil fuel consumption. Membership of political negotiating groups (such as the Group of 77 and Small Island Developing States) was a less important predictor. Conclusion: Our analysis indicated a higher engagement in countries that carry the heaviest climate-related health burdens, but lack necessary resources to address the impacts of climate change. These countries are shouldering responsibility for reminding the global community of the implications of climate change for people's health.","Dasandi, Niheer; Graham, Hilary; Lampard, Pete; Jankin Mikhaylov, Slava",Bull World Health Organ,,571

239876,The Pandemic's Toll-A Case for Clinician Support,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had an overwhelming impact on healthcare worldwide. Outstandingly, the aftermath on neoplastic patients is still largely unknown, and only isolated cases of COVID-19 during radiotherapy have been published. We will report the two-months experience of our Department, set in Lombardy ""red-zone"". METHODS: Data of 402 cancer patients undergoing active treatment from February 24 to April 24, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed; several indicators of the Department functioning were also analyzed. RESULTS: Dedicated measures allowed an overall limited reduction of the workload. Decrease of radiotherapy treatment number reached 17%, while the number of administration of systemic treatment and follow up evaluations kept constant. Conversely, new treatment planning faced substantial decline. Considering the patients, infection rate was 3.23% (13/402) and mortality 1.24% (5/402). Median age of COVID-19 patients was 69.7 years, the large majority were male and smokers (84.6%); lung cancer was the most common tumor type (61.5%), 84.6% of subjects were stage III-IV and 92.3% had comorbidities. Remarkably, 92.3% of the cases were detected before March 24. Globally, only 2.5% of ongoing treatments were suspended due to suspect or confirmed COVID-19 and 46.2% of positive patients carried on radiotherapy without interruption. Considering only the last month, infection rate among patients undergoing treatment precipitated to 0.43% (1/232) and no new contagions were reported within our staff. CONCLUSIONS: Although mortality rate in COVID-19 cancer patients is elevated, our results support the feasibility and safety of continuing anticancer treatment during SARS-Cov-2 pandemic by endorsing consistent preventive measures.","Buglione, Michela; Spiazzi, Luigi; Guerini, Andrea Emanuele; Barbera, Fernando; Pasinetti, Nadia; Pegurri, Ludovica; Triggiani, Luca; Tomasini, Davide; Greco, Diana; Costantino, Gianluca; Bragaglio, Alessandra; Bonometti, Nadia; Liccioli, Mara; Mascaro, Lorella; Alongi, Filippo; Magrini, Stefano Maria",Radiat Oncol,,571

Natural outbreaks, of both emerging and re-emerging diseases, can have significant impacts on local, national and regional communities. An effective response to these outbreaks relies heavily on the coordination of both public health and Veterinary Services to identify the signs, symptoms and patterns of disease quickly and respond accordingly. The future global risks related to infectious disease are influenced by several factors, including human migration, urban development, agricultural development and climate change. As technology advances, we are more aware of the potential risks associated with dual-use equipment and research (defined as equipment or research that can be used for legitimate as well as nefarious purposes), synthetic biology, the engineering of biological systems, and the evolving modus operandi of criminals and terrorist groups. The ability to detect natural, accidental or deliberate outbreaks and incidents will rely heavily on cross-agency communication, establishment of informationsharing platforms, development of joint investigative strategies, and recognition that effective response requires a strong health and security agency interface. Therefore, the management of a suspicious biological incident requires intersectoral and interregional cooperation employing a comprehensive approach which considers prevention, preparedness, response and recovery and identifies and considers the unique characteristics and requirements of the incident.","Hoile, R",Rev Sci Tech,,571

METHODS: The evaluations were carried out by means of an online survey, with a sample of 3480 persons in the first data collection and 1041 and 569 persons in the successive evaluation periods. The presence of depressive symptoms, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was evaluated by means of screening tests. Sociodemographic data, Covid-19 variables, loneliness, psychological well-being, social support, discrimination and a sense of belonging, were collected. RESULTS: Depressive symptoms increased significantly throughout the confinement, decreasing at the last assessment but not dropping to previous levels. In anxiety, there are no significant changes between the three evaluations, but a downward trend can be seen over time. Regarding the symptomatology of PTSD, a downward trend is observed throughout the three evaluations, with significantly lower scores between the first and third assessments. The different regression models developed reveal the importance of perceived loneliness and spiritual well-being as the main predictors of mental health, as well as the importance of the lower age for depression and the female gender for anxiety and PSTD. CONCLUSIONS: This research shows that the pandemic has had a negative impact on our mental health, which still does not seem to be at pre-crisis levels, although it has improved as the emergency situation subsides. These results underline the importance of paying greater attention to mental health, and reveal key variables such as spiritual well-being and perceived loneliness in which to intervene from different care services, as well as younger people and women as vulnerable groups on which to focus more attention.","González-Sanguino, C; Ausín, B; Castellanos, M A; Saiz, J; Muñoz, M",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,,571

241520,Universal weekly testing as the UK COVID-19 lockdown exit strategy,2020,"When a bug manifests in a user-facing application, it is likely to be exposed through the graphical user interface (GUI). Given the importance of visual information to the process of identifying and understanding such bugs, users are increasingly making use of screenshots and screen-recordings as a means to report issues to developers. However, when such information is reported en masse, such as during crowd-sourced testing, managing these artifacts can be a time-consuming process. As the reporting of screen-recordings in particular becomes more popular, developers are likely to face challenges related to manually identifying videos that depict duplicate bugs. Due to their graphical nature, screen-recordings present challenges for automated analysis that preclude the use of current duplicate bug report detection techniques. To overcome these challenges and aid developers in this task, this paper presents Tango, a duplicate detection technique that operates purely on video-based bug reports by leveraging both visual and textual information. Tango combines tailored computer vision techniques, optical character recognition, and text retrieval. We evaluated multiple configurations of Tango in a comprehensive empirical evaluation on 4,860 duplicate detection tasks that involved a total of 180 screen-recordings from six Android apps. Additionally, we conducted a user study investigating the effort required for developers to manually detect duplicate video-based bug reports and compared this to the effort required to use Tango. The results reveal that Tango's optimal configuration is highly effective at detecting duplicate video-based bug reports, accurately ranking target duplicate videos in the top-2 returned results in 83% of the tasks. Additionally, our user study shows that, on average, Tango can reduce developer effort by over 60%, illustrating its practicality.","Cooper, Nathan; Bernal-C'ardenas, Carlos; Chaparro, Oscar; Moran, Kevin; Poshyvanyk, Denys",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09194v2.pdf,571

Targeted adaptations of opioid agonist treatment (OAT) are required to protect this vulnerable population and the healthcare workers providing services. In this article we describe and discuss the associated evidence for the measures implemented to reduce the risks associated with COVID-19 to Irish OAT services. Irish OAT services have implemented the following measures: reduced supervision requirements, increased the use of virtual patient care, streamlined assessment and induction processes to remove barriers to OAT access, provided home delivery of medications, increased access to naloxone and overdose programmes, targeted health and social interventions for the homeless and reduced our prison population. For now, non-essential services including drug and blood-borne virus screening and hepatitis C treatment have been postponed. Planning and review of Irish OAT services is ongoing so that further adaptations can be implemented as challenges emerge. Rapid adaptation of OAT services is required to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on patients, staff and the general public. Ongoing evaluation of these measures is critical since many of these changes may have an enormous impact on health and social care outcomes and be cost saving in a post-COVID future.

244604,Nothing New Here to See: How COVID-19 and State Violence Converge on Black Life,2020,"INTRODUCTION: In people living with HIV (PLWH), immune activation and inflammation levels are high even when viral suppression is maintained, potentially contributing to several comorbidities, and hampering the immune response to infections such as the recent SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19). AREAS COVERED: Immune activation and inflammation play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severe COVID-19 patients may experience cytokine release syndrome (CRS), leading to alveolar damage, pulmonary fibrinolysis, dysregulated coagulation, and pulmonary injury. Into the systemic circulation, cytokines in excess might leak out of pulmonary circulation, causing systemic symptoms and possibly a multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome. Preexisting comorbidities are also linked to worse COVID-19 outcome: studies suggest that diabetes and hypertension are linked to higher mortality rates. Such comorbidities are more frequent in PLWH, but it is unclear if they have worse outcomes in the case of COVID-19. The literature was searched in PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE, and manually in COVID-19 resources. EXPERT OPINION: A body of evidence shows that HIV and SARS-CoV-2 are able to activate inflammatory pathways, acute in the case of SARS-CoV-2, chronic in the case of HIV, while the comorbidities seem to represent, in the first case, a contributory cause, in the second an effect of the virus-induced damage.","Maggi, Paolo; Ricci, Elena; Messina, Vincenzo; Salzillo, Angela; Simeone, Filomena; Iodice, Angelo; Socio, Giuseppe Vittorio",Expert Rev Clin Immunol,,571
245098,American Exceptionalism in the Time of COVID-19: American National Identity-Based Populism Versus Cosmopolitan Global Integration Responses to Twenty-First-Century Global Crises,2021,"In the outbreak of infectious diseases such as COVID-19, social media channels are important tools for the public to obtain information and form their opinions on infection risk, which can affect their disease prevention behaviors and the consequent disease transmission processes. However, there has been a lack of theoretical investigation into how social media and human behaviors jointly affect the spread of infectious diseases. In this study, we develop an agent-based modeling framework that couples (1) a general opinion dynamics model that describes how individuals form their opinions on epidemic risk with various information sources, (2) a behavioral adoption model that simulates the adoption of disease prevention behaviors, and (3) an epidemiological SEIR model that simulates the spread of diseases in a host population. Through simulating the spread of a coronavirus-like disease in a hypothetical residential area, the modeling results show that social media can make a community more sensitive to external drivers. Social media can increase the public's awareness of infection risk, which is beneficial for epidemic containment, when high-quality epidemic information exists at the early stage of pandemics. However, fabricated and fake news on social media, after a ""latent period"", can lead to a significant increase in infection rate. The modeling results provide scientific evidence for the intricate interplay between social media and human behaviors in epidemic dynamics and control, and highlight the importance of public education to promote behavioral changes and the need to correct misinformation and fake news on social media in a timely manner.","Du, Erhu; Chen, Eddie; Liu, Ji; Zheng, Chunmiao",Sci Total Environ,,571

245427,Looking back: A vertical retrospective of COVID-19,2020,"The recent outbreaks and rapid international spread of SARS-CoV-2 pose a global health emergency. Its trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein interacts with human ACE2-receptor to mediate viral entry into host-cells. Here we present cryo-EM structures of a tightly closed SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer with packed fusion peptide, and an ACE2-bound S-trimer at 2.7 Å and 3.8 Å resolution, respectively. Accompanying ACE2 binding to the up receptor-binding domain (RBD), the associated ACE2-RBD exhibits continuous swing-motions within the S-trimer. Noteworthy, SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer appears much more sensitive to ACE2-receptor than SARS-CoV S-trimer regarding receptor-triggered transformation from the closed prefusion state to fusion-prone open state, potentially contributing to the superior infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. We defined the RBD T470-T478 loop and Y505 as viral determinants for specific recognition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD by ACE2. Our findings depict the mechanism of ACE2-induced S-trimer conformational transitions from ground prefusion state toward postfusion state, facilitating development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and therapeutics.","Xu, Cong; Wang, Yanxing; Liu, Caixuan; Zhang, Chao; Han, Wenyu; Hong, Xiaoyu; Wang, Yifan; Hong, Qin; Wang, Shutian; Zhao, Qiaoyu; Wang, Yalei; Yang, Yong; Chen, Kaijian; Zheng, Wei; Kong, Liangliang; Wang, Fangfang; Zuo, Qinyu; Huang, Zhong; Cong, Yao",Sci.

The completion of olfactory recognition requires the participation of various complex protein families. However, little is known about the olfactory-related proteins in Semiothisa cinerearia Bremer et Grey, an important pest of Chinese scholar tree. In this study, we sequenced the antennal transcriptome of S. cinerearia and identified 125 olfactory-related genes, including 25 odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), 15 chemosensory proteins (CSPs), two sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs), 52 odorant receptors (ORs), eight gustatory receptors (GRs) and 23 ionotropic receptors (IRs). BLASTX best hit results and phylogenetic analyses indicated that these genes were most identical to their respective orthologs from Ectropis obliqua. Further quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that three ScinOBPs and three ScinORs were highly expressed in male antennae, while seven ScinOBPs and twelve ScinORs were female-specifically expressed.

245803,COVID-19: The New Challenges,2021,"Arousal and sleep represent fundamental physiological domains, and alterations in the form of insomnia (difficulty falling or staying asleep) or hypersomnia (increased propensity for falling asleep or increased sleep duration) are prevalent clinical problems. Current first-line treatments include psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. Despite significant success, a number of patients do not benefit sufficiently. Progress is limited by an incomplete understanding of the -neurobiology of insomnia and hypersomnia. This work summarizes current concepts of the regulation of arousal and sleep and its modulation through noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS), including transcranial magnetic, current, and auditory stimulation. Particularly, we suggest: (1) characterization of patients with sleep problems - across diagnostic entities of mental disorders - based on specific alterations of sleep, including alterations of sleep slow waves, sleep spindles, cross-frequency coupling of brain oscillations, local sleep-wake regulation, and REM sleep and (2) targeting these with specific NIBS techniques. While evidence is accumulating that the modulation of specific alterations of sleep through NIBS is feasible, it remains to be tested whether this translates to clinically relevant effects and new treatment developments.","Geiser, Tim; Hertenstein, Elisabeth; Fehér, Kristoffer; Maier, Jonathan G; Schneider, Carlotta L; Züst, Marc A; Wunderlin, Marina; Mikutta, Christian; Klöppel, Stefan; Nissen, Christoph",Neuropsychobiology,,571

246003,Covid-19: All essential workers in England can now be tested,2020,"Glaciers in the northwestern Himalayan region of Jammu and Kashmir have been reported to be retreating at higher rates as compared to other parts of the Himalayan arc. This study assessed area changes, frontal retreat, and geodetic mass balance of Machoi Glacier interspersed between the Greater Himalayan mountain range of Kashmir and Zanskar from 1972 to 2019. Further, the cryoconite, albedo, aerosol variability, and sediments in glacier ice were studied to correlate them with glacier recession. The glacier has lost an area of ~1.88 km2 (~29%) from 1972 to 2019 with a frontal retreat of 500 m at a rate of 10.6 m a−1. The geodetic mass balance analysis shows that the glacier surface lowered by 43.7 m losing 0.215 Gt from 2000 to 2011. The cryoconite holes on the glacier are mostly present in the ablation part having an average diameter of 5–7 cm. Both cryoconite holes and light-absorbing impurities in glacier ice show an inverse relation with altitude. Analysis of albedo data indicated no trend for the glacier, however, an insignificant decreasing trend was observed for the ablation zone of the glacier. The seasonal trends of albedo indicated a decrease during winter. The reanalysis data about aerosols indicated a significantly increasing trend from 1980 to 2018 and a decreased concentration in 2019 and 2020 owing to the prevailing COVID19 scenario. The receding glaciers in the region can severely impact the streamflow regimes, hydropower generation, and agriculture production in the region. However, more detailed in-situ data about glacier albedo, lithology, biophysical and chemical characterization of cryoconite holes, anthropogenic footprint and associated aerosol deposition needs to be generated to precisely ascertain their influence on glacier dynamics.","Rashid, I.; Majeed, U.; Najar, N.

246180,Best practices to reduce COVID-19 transmission via contact with environmental surfaces,2021,"Besides the respiratory system, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was shown to affect other essential organs such as the kidneys. Early kidney involvement during the course of infection was associated with worse outcomes, which could be attributed to the direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of kidney cells. In this study, the effect of commonly used medications on the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2, and TMPRSS2 protein in kidney tissues was evaluated. This was done by in silico analyses of publicly available transcriptomic databases of kidney tissues of rats treated with multiple doses of commonly used medications. Of 59 tested medications, 56% modified ACE2 expression, whereas 24% modified TMPRSS2 expression. ACE2 was increased with only a few of the tested medication groups, namely the renin-angiotensin inhibitors, such as enalapril, antibacterial agents, such as nitrofurantoin, and the proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole. The majority of the other medications decreased ACE2 expression to variable degrees with allopurinol and cisplatin causing the most noticeable downregulation. The expression level of TMPRSS2 was increased with a number of medications, such as diclofenac, furosemide, and dexamethasone, whereas other medications, such as allopurinol, suppressed the expression of this gene. The prolonged exposure to combinations of these medications could regulate the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in a way that may affect kidney susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data presented here suggest that we should be vigilant about the potential effects of commonly used medications on kidney tissue expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.","Saheb Sharif-Askari, Narjes; Saheb Sharif-Askari, Fatemeh; Alabed, Mashael; Tayoun, Ahmad Abou; Loney, Tom; Uddin, Mohammed; Senok, Abiola; Al Heialy, Saba; Hamoudi, Rifat; Kashour, Tarek; Alsheikh-Ali, Alawi; Hamid, Qutayba; Halwani, Rabih",Clinical and translational science (Online),,571

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 122 patients (61 men and 61 women, 48 ± 15 years) confirmed with COVID-19 and 48 patients (23 men and 25 women, 47 ± 19 years) confirmed with influenza were enrolled in the study. Thin-section CT was performed. The clinical data and the chest CT findings were recorded. RESULTS: The most common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever (74%) and cough (63%), and 102 patients (83%) had Wuhan contact. Pneumonia in 50 patients with COVID-19 (45%) distributed in the peripheral regions of the lung, while it showed mixed distribution in 26 patients (74%) with influenza (p = 0.022). The most common CT features of the COVID-19 group were pure ground-glass opacities (GGO, 36%), GGO with consolidation (51%), rounded opacities (35%), linear opacities (64%), bronchiolar wall thickening (49%), and interlobular septal thickening (66%). Compared with the influenza group, the COVID-19 group was more likely to have rounded opacities (35% vs. 17%, p = 0.048) and interlobular septal thickening (66% vs. 43%, p = 0.014), but less likely to have nodules (28% vs. 71%, p < 0.001), tree-in-bud sign (9% vs. 40%, p < 0.001), and pleural effusion (6% vs. 31%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in the CT manifestations of patients with COVID-19 and influenza. Presence of rounded opacities and interlobular septal thickening, with the absence of nodules and tree-in-bud sign, and with the typical peripheral distribution, may help us differentiate COVID-19 from influenza.

247625,On Nonnegative Matrix and Tensor Decompositions for COVID-19 Twitter Dynamics,2020-10-04,"BACKGROUND: Genetic risk factors that contribute to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have yet to be elucidated. Historically, serotonergic dysfunction has been implicated. Evidence from the literature points towards the serotonin receptor 2A gene (HTR2A) as a primary candidate. Our meta-analysis investigated whether polymorphisms in HTR2A are associated with OCD or its subtypes, based on sex and age of onset. METHODS: Studies employing case-control or family-based designs were systematically searched, and those meeting eligibility underwent quality assessment, resulting in 18 studies. A random-effects meta-analysis using standard inverse-variance weighting to compute odds ratio (OR) was conducted. To examine sensitivity, results were also obtained using a more conservative statistical method. RESULTS: Three HTR2A variants were identified: T102C, G-1438A, and C516T. T102C and G-1438A were analyzed together due to strong linkage disequilibrium, where the 102T allele co-occurs with -1438A allele. Results reported as OR [95%CI] showed that the T/A allele were significantly associated with OCD, 1.14 [1.01, 1.29]. After stratification, results remained significant for females, 1.20 [1.00, 1.45], and early-onset OCD, 1.27 [1.02, 1.58], but not males, 1.06 [0.91, 1.23]. No associations were found for late-onset OCD, 0.98 [0.70, 1.37], or C516T, 1.22 [0.14, 10.37], but conclusions cannot be drawn from two studies. LIMITATIONS: Associations no longer reached significance with the conservative statistical approach. HTR2A alone cannot explain OCD complexity and limited samples reporting genetic data according to subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a possible association of HTR2A polymorphisms with OCD, but further investigations considering sex and age of onset with larger samples is needed.","Mattina, Gabriella Francesca; Samaan, Zainab; Hall, Geoffrey B; Steiner, Meir",J Affect Disord,,571

A total of 136 patients with ED were enrolled. The baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were collected. Penile Doppler ultrasonography (PDU) was performed on all patients by a blinded sonographer. Sildenafil was administrated to all patients with an adjusted dose of 50 or 100 mg on demand over a period of 3 months. A follow-up was conducted on all patients using the Erectile Hardness Score (EHS) questionnaire along with the visual and tactile version of the standardised EHS tool. The peak systolic velocity (PSV) and IMT were compared between sildenafil responders and sildenafil nonresponders, while receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were used to calculate the cut-off values and compare the test power respectively. There was no statistical difference from the baseline characteristics. The IMT of cavernous artery was more accurate than PSV to predict the sildenafil response (AUC = 0.809, 0.626 respectively). IMT could predict sildenafil responders more accurately than PSV, and the cut-off value of the IMT of the cavernous artery was less than 0.22 mm.","Zhang, Yuyang; Zhou, Wang; Wu, Xu; Liu, Guodong; Dai, Yutian; Jiang, Hui; Zhang, Xiansheng",Andrologia,,571

Objective: To describe case characteristics, including viral dynamics and transmission of infection, for individuals who have clinically recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection but continued to have positive test results following discontinuation of isolation precautions. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used data collected from June 11, 2020, to October 19, 2020, as part of the National Basketball Association (NBA) closed campus occupational health program in Orlando, Florida, which required daily RT-PCR testing and ad hoc serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Nearly 4000 NBA players, staff, and vendors participated in the NBA's regular and postseason occupational health program in Orlando. Persistent positive cases were those who recovered from a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, satisfied US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for discontinuation of isolation precautions, and had at least 1 postinfection positive RT-PCR test(s) result. Exposures: Person-days of participation in indoor, unmasked activities that involved direct exposure between persistent positive cases and noninfected individuals. Main Outcomes and Measures: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 following interaction with persistent positive individuals, as measured by the number of new COVID-19 cases in the Orlando campus program. Results: Among 3648 individuals who participated, 36 (1%) were persistent positive cases, most of whom were younger than 30 years (24 [67%]) and male (34 [94%]). Antibodies were detected in 33 individuals (91.7%); all remained asymptomatic following the index persistent positive RT-PCR result. Cycle threshold values for persistent positive RT-PCR test results were typically above the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 limit of detection.

As such, the possibility of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood. We describe an investigation of two instances of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the same individual. METHODS: A 25-year-old man who was a resident of Washoe County in the US state of Nevada presented to health authorities on two occasions with symptoms of viral infection, once at a community testing event in April, 2020, and a second time to primary care then hospital at the end of May and beginning of June, 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from the patient at each presentation and twice during follow-up. Nucleic acid amplification testing was done to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection. We did next-generation sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs. Sequence data were assessed by two different bioinformatic methodologies. A short tandem repeat marker was used for fragment analysis to confirm that samples from both infections came from the same individual. FINDINGS: The patient had two positive tests for SARS-CoV-2, the first on April 18, 2020, and the second on June 5, 2020, separated by two negative tests done during follow-up in May, 2020. Genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 showed genetically significant differences between each variant associated with each instance of infection. The second infection was symptomatically more severe than the first. INTERPRETATION: Genetic discordance of the two SARS-CoV-2 specimens was greater than could be accounted for by short-term in vivo evolution. These findings suggest that the patient was infected by SARS-CoV-2 on two separate occasions by a genetically distinct virus. Thus, previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 might not guarantee total immunity in all cases. All individuals, whether previously diagnosed with COVID-19 or not, should take identical precautions to avoid infection with SARS-CoV-2. The implications of reinfections could be relevant for vaccine development and application.

Based on these reports this study was developed to evaluate the renal function of normal healthy dogs. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine were measured in four groups of 5 dogs submitted to a single surgical procedure. Two groups received flunixin meglumine and the other two ketoprofen, both in therapeutic dosages. The results showed values of BUN and serum creatinine within normal range for dogs. It is fair to conclude that flunixin meglumine and ketoprofen do not produce renal failure when administered during the peri-operative period in normal healthy dogs.","Schossler, Deila; Meller Alievi, Marcelo; Picada Emanuelli, Mauren; Eduardo Schossler, João",Acta cir. bras.,,571

DESIGN: Florida's 2020 COVID-19 cases are summarized into age-specific county rates and supplemented with socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and 2020 presidential voting results to assess the association of population age structure and political choices with age-specific COVID-19 infection, emergency, hospitalization, and mortality rates. RESULTS: Younger counties experienced higher under-25 infection rates, as well as higher over-64 infection, emergency, and hospitalization rates. Older counties experienced reduced infection rates for all ages and decreased over-64 emergency and hospitalization rates. Trump's vote share was associated with higher infection rates for all and higher over-64 emergency, hospitalization, and mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: Younger counties experience higher COVID-19 infection rates for all residents, with elevated morbidity risks among seniors.

Currently, there is no consensus on whether the antibodies, if present, are protective. Our regular measurements of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, starting in July 2020, have provided us with the opportunity of becoming acquainted with the five different immunoassays. A total of 149 patients were enrolled in our study. We measured the samples using each immunoassay, then performing a virus neutralization test and comparing the results of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with this test. We observed that the production of neutralizing antibodies is age-dependent. Elderly patients have a higher proportion of high neutralizing titers than young patients. Based on our results, and in combination with the literature findings, we can conclude that the serological SARS-CoV-2 antibody measurement is a helpful tool in the fight against COVID-19. The assays can provide information about the patient's previous contact with the virus. Anti-spike protein assays correlate well with the virus neutralization test and can be used in the screening of potential convalescent plasma donors.","Simánek, Václav; Pecen, Ladislav; Krátká, Zuzana; Fürst, Tomás; Rezácková, Hana; Topolcan, Ondrej; Fajfrlík, Karel; Sedlácek, Dalibor; Sín, Robin; Pazdiora, Petr; Zelená, Hana; Slouka, David; Kucera, Radek",Diagnostics (Basel),,571

The degradation led to a breakdown of the panels and increased the potential for nanorelease. Thermal analysis revealed that the thickness of the test panels and reinforcement with MWCNTs had a significant influence on the stability of PP-MWCNT composites. Differential scanning calorimetry indicated that the MWCNTs acted as nucleation points, increasing the crystallization temperatures of PP-MWCNT, which reduced the extent of aging. Weathering decreased both the melting and crystallization temperatures of PP by as much as 20 o C. The reduction in the temperatures was inversely proportional to the thickness of the panels. The activation energy (E a ) obtained using isoconversional kinetics of the TGA analysis showed that the effective thermo-oxidative degradations of PP changed during aging. The E a for the initial stages of thermal degradation decreased from ~330 kJ/mol to ~100 kJ/mol for aged PP. During the late degradation stages, the E a values increased to ~300 kJ/mol. These results suggest that early degradation were altered because of the changes in the molecular structure of the aged P and a shift in the degradation rate-limiting steps.","Han, Changseok; Sahle-Demessie, Endalkachew; Zhao, Amy Q; Richardson, Teri; Wang, Jun",Carbon N Y,,571

Positive impacts on the spread of multiresistant pathogens and infections in general may be observed with the implementation of general preventative measures for the spread of infectious disease such as social distancing, reduced travel and increased personal hygiene. This pandemic has accelerated the development of novel technologies, such as mRNA vaccines, that may be used to fight other diseases. These should be capitalized upon to manage the ongoing antimicrobial resistance pandemic in the background. However, it is likely that the COVID-19 pandemic is fueling the emergence of antimicrobial resistance due to high rates of inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing, the high use of biocides and the interruption of treatment for other conditions. Clinical uncertainty driven by the lack of effective diagnostics and practice of telemedicine may have driven the inappropriate use of antimicrobials. As pathogens know no borders, increased focus is needed for infectious diseases still threatening low- and middle-income countries such as tuberculosis.

SUMMARY: PPE shortages impacted hospitals throughout the nation in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic response. The PPE requirement for sterile compounding and need to maintain supplies within the pharmacy cleanroom are often overlooked. A sustained supply of PPE is critical to ensure an uninterrupted supply of compounded medications to our patient population. Multiple conservation strategies, including staffing changes, communication, adjustments to training, and even reuse of select PPE, can assist with conservation. CONCLUSION: PPE in pharmacy cleanrooms is critical for the continued provision of sterile compounds with appropriate beyond-use dates and effective patient care. Pharmacy departments must employ multiple conservation strategies to ensure PPE is available for continued compounding of sterile products, and early planning and implementation of conservation strategies are key.","Wollitz, Amanda Danielle; Hong, Christine; Blanco, Fernando",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,571

With the great reduction in human mobility and daily activities, considerable impacts have been imposed on the global air transportation industry. This study applies a hybrid SARIMA-based intervention model to measure the differences in the impacts of different control measures implemented in China, the U.S. and Singapore on air passenger and air freight traffic. To explore the effect of time span for the measures to be in force, two scenarios are invented, namely a long-term intervention and a short-term intervention, and predictions are made till the end of 2020 for all three countries under both scenarios. As a result, predictive patterns of the selected metrics for the three countries are rather different. China is predicted to have the mildest economic impact on the air transportation industry in this year in terms of air passenger revenue and air cargo traffic, provided that the control measures were prompt and effective. The U.S. would suffer from a far-reaching impact on the industry if the same control measures are maintained. More uncertainties are found for Singapore, as it is strongly associated with international travel demands. Suggestions are made for the three countries and the rest of the world on how to seek a balance between the strictness of control measures and the potential long-term industrial losses.","Meng, Fanyu; Gong, Wenwu; Liang, Jun; Li, Xian; Zeng, Yiping; Yang, Lili",PLoS One,,571

This commentary offers patient counseling recommendations based on the current available evidence. While there are currently no specific data for psoriasis biologics and COVID-19, data are presented here from phase III clinical trials of psoriasis biologics on rates of upper respiratory infection, influenza, and serious infection. Overall these data reveal that on the whole, psoriasis biologics do not show major increases in infection risk compared to placebo during the course of these trials. However, as the COVID-19 virus is a novel pathogen that is associated with mortality in a subset of patients, a cautious approach is warranted. We discuss factors that may alter the benefit-risk ratio of biologic use during this time of COVID-19 outbreak. Ultimately, treatment decisions should be made on the basis of dialogue between patient and provider, considering each patient's individualized situation.

All continued their observations using a video link, called ‘tele-observation’. The observers were doing either their first or second year at infant observation in a course at Tehran University of Medical Sciences with babies from seven months to one and a half years old. The younger babies assisted their observers because they were not mobile, while some older ones were mobile, and some were walking; therefore, able to move out of range of the video link. The technology used was a simple cellphone camera using ‘WhatsApp’. The writers discuss the interrelation of two different arenas, the arena of technology and the emotional arena of infant observation. Three significant areas are covered, the observer-mother relationship, the observer-infant relationship and the mother-infant relationship.

Consequently, our aim was to fill this gap. Three electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL) were searched in our study. Observational studies examining the link between multimorbidity and loneliness, social isolation, and social frailty were included, whereas disease-specific samples were excluded. Data extraction included methods, characteristics of the sample, and the main results. A quality assessment was conducted. Two reviewers performed the study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. In sum, eight studies were included in the final synthesis. Some cross-sectional and longitudinal studies point to an association between multimorbidity and increased levels of loneliness. However, the associations between multimorbidity and social isolation as well as social frailty remain largely underexplored. The quality of the studies included was rather high. In conclusion, most of the included studies showed a link between multimorbidity and increased loneliness.

Yet levels of oil production and consumption remain high in the state. This gap between California's oil politics and its climate ambitions is deepened by decentralized decision-making processes. County officials are tasked with extractive planning decisions that have wide-ranging implications. In this Viewpoint article, we analyze proposals for enhanced extraction at the Cat Canyon oilfield in Santa Barbara County. After two of three proposals were withdrawn in recent months, we highlight how it has been oil industry volatility and public opposition - rather than state regulations - that have brought county development plans into closer alignment with state climate goals. As California pursues a goal of 'managing the decline' of domestic oil production, we identify strategies for bridging such gaps between local decision-making and state-level climate action, including: a comprehensive state-wide ban on new enhanced oil extraction projects; a 2,500â¯ft buffer zone around extraction sites; and revenue generation schemes that support a just transition. As Covid-19 forces an oil surplus and lowered production, there are opportunities to enact such changes - particularly by redirecting oil industry labor toward the growing problem of well decommissioning.","Partridge, Tristan; Barandiaran, Javiera; Walsh, Casey; Bakardzhieva, Kalina; Bronstein, Leah; Hernandez, Monica",,,571
253459,"Role of knowledge, behavior, norms, and e-guidelines in controlling the spread of COVID-19: evidence from Pakistan",2020,"Bacterial pathogens rapidly develop resistance to clinically approved antibiotics. Together with the subsiding economic incentives for the development of newer and more effective antibiotic therapies, this threatens to cause a bacterial disease pandemic in the next 30 years. For this reason, timely analyses of various scientific and socioeconomic aspects of alternatives to traditional antibiotic therapies are needed. Here, pharmacoeconomic cost-of-illness, cost-effectiveness and price sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of multidrug resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa implicated in pneumonia on healthcare systems of the United States and of the developing countries. The assessment was extended to include the effects of various therapies for this condition, one group of which consisted of colistin administered intravenously or with the use of a nebulizer and another therapy coming in the form of an inhalable colloidal formulation comprising biocompatible antibacterial nanoparticles. Both colistin and nanoparticle therapies produced net gain per quality adjusted life year (QALY) saved for patients with pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa in the United States. In the developing world, in contrast, where the pricing sensitivity is shown to be higher, there is a positive cost of $8800 and $3600 per QALY saved associated with the use of colistin at a price adjusted to the local economy and administered through a parenteral route or through a nebulizer, respectively. Simultaneously, thanks to the higher affordability compensating for the 15% lower clinical efficacy assumed in the model, there is a net gain of $10,100 per QALY saved with the use of the nanoparticle formulation, translating to $52,000 gain for each life saved by the treatment. In conclusion, inorganic nanoparticle therapies for infectious disease are not only more immune to eliciting resistance than small-molecule antibiotics, but are also more applicable in low-cost healthcare systems of the developing world. The current generation of antibiotic therapies is cost-effective in high-cost healthcare systems, such as the one of the United States, but its application in more frugal settings, where pricing is as important as efficacy, comes with tremendous costs. These results demonstrate the considerable disparity in profit margin flexibility depending on the wealth and the size of the healthcare economy, which contributes daily to the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor.","Uskoković, Vuk",Technology in Society,,571

The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the proportion and mortality of SARS-COV-2 in these patients. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was carried out in PubMed, Web of Sciences, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CNKI, SciELO, and other databases to identify all relevant studies published up to 10 January, 2020. The proportion and mortality in the patients were assessed by odd ratio (OR) and the corresponding 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI). Results: A total of ten case-series including 11,755 cases with SARS-COV-2 infection and 942 deaths were selected. Among them, there were total of 791 DM patients with 186 deaths, 225 CKD patients with 45 deaths, 790 hypertension cases with 86 deaths, and 471 CVDs cases with 60 deaths. Pooled data revealed that the proportion of SARS-COV-2 infection in the patients with hypertension, DM, CVDs and CKD were 21.1 %, 16.3 %, 14.0 % and 5.0 %, respectively. Moreover, the SARS-COV-2 infection were associated with an increased risk of mortality in DM (OR = 0.549, CI 95 % 0.448-0.671, p &#8804; 0.001) and CKD (OR = 0.552, 95 % CI 0.367-0.829, p = 0.004) patients, but not hypertension and CVDs.

Conclusions: Our pooled data showed that the proportion of SARS-COV-2 infection was the highest in the Iranian patients with hypertension (21.1 %) followed by DM (16.3 %), CVDs (14.0 %) and CKD (5.0 %). Moreover, DM and CKD in patients with SARS-COV-2 infection were associated with a 0.549 and 0.552-fold increase in mortality, respectively.

Patientswith autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD) are more likely toexperience serious COVID-19 related events, although risk factorsfor such outcomes have yet to be established. In particular, the riskprofiles of specific ARD therapies are unknown.MethodsA Scottish wide registry was rapidly developed in March 2020. Clinicalcharacteristics and outcomes of infected cases were collated acrossall Scottish health boards, leveraging the Scottish Systemic VasculitisNetwork and Scottish Society for Rheumatology. Eligible patientsincluded any adult ARD patients with a confirmed (clinically or PCR)diagnosis of COVID-19. Simple descriptive statistics were employed toevaluate associations between ARD therapies and a serious COVID-19disease outcome, as defined by a requirement of invasive or noninvasive ventilation, and/or death.ResultsA total of 69 patients (59% female;mean age 65.6, SD15.5) wererecruited to the registry , 92% of which required hospitalisation. Caseswere most commonly diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 32, 46.4%) followed by spondyloarthritis (n = 19, 27.5%) and systemicvasculitis (n = 9, 13.0%).

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Departments of Nephrology, Combined Military Hospital Peshawar and Combined Military Hospital Malir, Karachi, during March 2020. METHODOLOGY: Doctors working in different parts of Pakistan were approached online through snowball sampling technique. Those with history of psychiatric disorders were excluded. They were administered a questionnaire including Seven-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Reasons why they felt anxious were also explored. RESULTS: Responses from 431 doctors, including 238 (55.2%) males, were evaluated. Most of them were younger than 30 years (286; 66.4%), in training (335; 77.7%), and working in public hospitals (347; 80.5%). Mild, moderate and severe anxiety was seen in 120 (27.8%), 103 (23.9%) and 42 (9.7%) doctors, respectively. Median score on GAD-7 was 6 (interquartile range = 3 - 11). Lady doctors had higher scores than males (7 vs. 5; p=0.024). No significant differences in scores were found amongst doctors from different workplaces or of different professional status. A greater proportion of females had anxiety as compared to males (67.9% vs. 56.3%; p=0.014). Frequency of anxiety was not different amongst doctors of different professional status, types of workplace and amongst different age groups. Commonest reasons for anxiety were lack of personal protective equipment (83.8% doctors); and the fear that they could spread infection to family members (79.8% doctors).

254311,COVID-19: Order!,2020,"Federated Learning (FL) is a concept first introduced by Google in 2016, in which multiple devices collaboratively learn a machine learning model without sharing their private data under the supervision of a central server. This offers ample opportunities in critical domains such as healthcare, finance etc, where it is risky to share private user information to other organisations or devices. While FL appears to be a promising Machine Learning (ML) technique to keep the local data private, it is also vulnerable to attacks like other ML models. Given the growing interest in the FL domain, this report discusses the opportunities and challenges in federated learning.","Mammen, Priyanka Mary",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05428v1.pdf,571
254312,COVID-19: Order!,2020,"Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide, becoming an unprecedented public health emergency. Rapid detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suspected cases is crucial to control the spread of infection. We aimed to evaluate the time length of negativization from the onset of symptoms in healthcare workers (HCWs) with COVID-19, and to evaluate significant variations in cycle threshold (CT) values and gene positivity (E, RdRP, and N genes) among positive individuals who returned to work. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive cohort of 182 SARS-CoV-2-positive HCWs in Milan, from 16 March to 30 April 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested by RT-PCR. Results: Asymptomatic HCWs were 17.6% (32/182), and 58 healed at 30 April 2020. The median time length of negativization was 4 weeks (35% of symptomatic versus 40% of asymptomatic HCWs). Four HCWs, healed at 30 April, turned positive within three weeks during controls set up in the work unit. Three-gene positivity had the greatest variability, and increasing CT values from single- to three-gene positivity among all age groups were observed. Conclusions: Self-isolation longer than two weeks and prolonged follow-up periods for the staff returning to work after COVID-19 could be the most suitable choices to counter the SARS-CoV-2 spread. Further studies are needed to investigate infectiousness profiles among positive individuals.","Cariani, Lisa; Orena, Beatrice Silvia; Ambrogi, Federico; Gambazza, Simone; Maraschini, Anna; Dodaro, Antonella; Oggioni, Massimo; Orlandi, Annarosa; Pirrone, Alessia; Uceda Renteria, Sara; Bernazzani, Mara; Cantù, Anna Paola; Ceriotti, Ferruccio; Lunghi, Giovanna",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,571

The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-19) pandemic exposes how the intersection of these vulnerabilities with individual behavior, healthcare access, and pre-existing conditions can lead to disproportionate risks of morbidity and mortality from the virus-induced illness, COVID-19. The available data shows that those who are black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) bear the brunt of this risk; however, missing data on race/ethnicity from federal, state, and local agencies impedes nuanced understanding of health disparities. In this commentary, we summarize the link between racism and COVID-19 disparities and the extent of missing data on race/ethnicity in critical COVID-19 reporting. In addition, we provide an overview of the current literature on missing demographic data in the US and hypothesize how racism contributes to nonresponse in health reporting broadly. Finally, we argue that health departments and healthcare systems must engage communities of color to co-develop race/ethnicity data collection processes as part of a comprehensive strategy for achieving health equity.","Kader, Farah; Smith, Clyde Lanford",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,571

Establishing diagnosis can not only detect ill people, but also create a statistical database, which may help manage containment measures, realize epidemic-prevention measures and organize the work of the world community on the way to elimination of the emerged problem. Study of the methods of COVID-19 diagnosis constitutes the aim of our research. By means of analyzing literary data and methods of laboratory studies we have managed to present variants of reactions use (polymerase chain reaction, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) for establishing the COVID-19 diagnosis. The authors of the article have conducted the analysis of COVID-19 diagnosis protocol files valid in the People’s Republic of China, the United States of America, South Korea, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Variants of polymerase chain reaction setup were studied (diagnostic identification of one or several viral genes). The mechanism of diagnosis in case of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and variants of use of corresponding methods of laboratory studies are presented. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) remains the only diagnostic reaction acknowledged by the World Health Organisation, however, a range of laboratory and instrumental methods can be used as auxiliary, helping lower the load on PCR diagnostic laboratories. There is no protocol of PCR administration, and determining the optimal diagnostic procedure of COVID-19 diagnosis is one of the forward-looking tasks for the world academic community. © 2021, Universitatea de Vest Vasile Goldis din Arad.

The secondary mental health impacts of the pandemic are thought to be significant. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a condition defined by recurrent obsessions and compulsions. It has been hypothesised that the focus on hygiene and contamination during the pandemic could exacerbate obsessive-compulsive symptoms in young people. METHOD: A systematic literature review was conducted. Papers were sought looking at the effect of the pandemic on obsessive-compulsive disorder in young people. RESULTS: Six published cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were identified, of which four studies investigated clinic samples with a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder and two looked at community adolescent populations. Five out of the six studies found that obsessive-compulsive symptoms were exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic appears to be associated with a worsening of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in young people. Being in treatment seems to have a protective effect. Maintaining mental health services during a pandemic is vital. It is important to be aware of the implications of pandemic on obsessive-compulsive symptoms in young people in order to allow them to access appropriate treatments. More research is needed in this area.","Cunning, Catherine; Hodes, Matthew",Clin Child Psychol Psychiatry,,571

Such changes can have a significant impact on mental health. Mobile sensing apps can passively record the daily life routines of people, thus making them aware of maladaptive behavioral adjustments to the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the views of people on mobile sensing apps that passively record behaviors and their potential to increase awareness and helpfulness for self-managing mental health during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an anonymous web-based survey including people with and those without mental disorders, asking them to rate the helpfulness of mobile sensing apps for the self-management of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was conducted in May 2020. RESULTS: The majority of participants, particularly those with a mental disorder (n=106/148, 72%), perceived mobile sensing apps as very or extremely helpful for managing their mental health by becoming aware of maladaptive behaviors. The perceived helpfulness of mobile sensing apps was also higher among people who experienced a stronger health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (ß=.24; 95% CI 0.16-0.33; P<.001), had a better understanding of technology (ß=.17; 95% CI 0.08-0.25; P<.001), and had a higher education (ß=.1; 95% CI 0.02-0.19; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the potential of mobile sensing apps to assist in mental health care during the pandemic.","Suruliraj, Banuchitra; Bessenyei, Kitti; Bagnell, Alexa; McGrath, Patrick; Wozney, Lori; Orji, Rita; Meier, Sandra",JMIR Form Res,,571

In developed countries, basic social amenities to support these are taken for granted; this is not the case in West African countries. Instead, those suggested safeguards against contracting COVID-19 have exposed the infrastructural deficit in West African countries. In addition, and more profoundly, these safeguards against the disease have distorted the traditional community-individuality balance. The enforcement of social distancing, self-isolation, and lockdown has made it impossible for West Africans to drift to their ancestral homes and villages, as is usually the case in times of crisis, with attendant consequences for communal life and traditional burial rites.

Eight ADCs are currently approved by FDA for clinical applications, with more novel ADCs under clinical development. Compared with traditional chemotherapy, ADCs combine the target specificity of antibodies with chemotherapeutic capabilities of cytotoxic drugs. The benefits include reduced systemic toxicity and enhanced therapeutic index for patients. However, the heterogeneous structures of ADCs and their dynamic changes following administration create challenges in their development. The understanding of ADC pharmacokinetics (PK) is crucial for the optimization of clinical dosing regimens when translating from animal to human. In addition, it contributes to the optimization of dose selection and clinical monitoring with regard to safety and efficacy. This manuscript reviews the PK characteristics of ADCs and summarizes the diverse approaches for PK modeling that can be used to evaluate an ADC at the preclinical and clinical stages to support their successful development. Despite the numerous available options, fit-for-purpose modeling approaches for the PK and PD of ADCs should be critically planned and well-thought-out to adequately support the development of an ADC.","Zuo, Peiying",AAPS J,,571

METHODS: We conducted targeted surveillance for MIS-C from March 15 to May 20, 2020, in pediatric health centers across the United States. The case definition included six criteria: serious illness leading to hospitalization, an age of less than 21 years, fever that lasted for at least 24 hours, laboratory evidence of inflammation, multisystem organ involvement, and evidence of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), antibody testing, or exposure to persons with Covid-19 in the past month. Clinicians abstracted the data onto standardized forms. RESULTS: We report on 186 patients with MIS-C in 26 states. The median age was 8.3 years, 115 patients (62%) were male, 135 (73%) had previously been healthy, 131 (70%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or antibody testing, and 164 (88%) were hospitalized after April 16, 2020. Organ-system involvement included the gastrointestinal system in 171 patients (92%), cardiovascular in 149 (80%), hematologic in 142 (76%), mucocutaneous in 137 (74%), and respiratory in 131 (70%). The median duration of hospitalization was 7 days (interquartile range, 4 to 10); 148 patients (80%) received intensive care, 37 (20%) received mechanical ventilation, 90 (48%) received vasoactive support, and 4 (2%) died. Coronary-artery aneurysms (z scores &#8805;2.5) were documented in 15 patients (8%), and Kawasaki's disease-like features were documented in 74 (40%). Most patients (171 [92%]) had elevations in at least four biomarkers indicating inflammation. The use of immunomodulating therapies was common: intravenous immune globulin was used in 144 (77%), glucocorticoids in 91 (49%), and interleukin-6 or 1RA inhibitors in 38 (20%). CONCLUSIONS: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with SARS-CoV-2 led to serious and life-threatening illness in previously healthy children and adolescents.

260443,One Year Later: What Have We Learned From COVID-19? Lessons and Accomplishments in Academic Pathology Departments,2021,"There is growing interest in contact tracing apps (CT apps) for pandemic management. It is crucial to consider ethical requirements before, while, and after implementing such apps. In this paper, we illustrate the complexity and multiplicity of the ethical considerations by presenting an ethical framework for a responsible design and implementation of CT apps. Using this framework as a starting point, we briefly highlight the interconnection of social and political contexts, available measures of pandemic management, and a multi-layer assessment of CT apps. We will discuss some trade-offs that arise from this perspective. We then suggest that public trust is of major importance for population uptake of contact tracing apps. Hasty, ill-prepared or badly communicated implementations of CT apps will likely undermine public trust, and as such, risk impeding general effectiveness.","Ranisch, Robert; Nijsingh, Niels; Ballantyne, Angela; van Bergen, Anne; Buyx, Alena; Friedrich, Orsolya; Hendl, Tereza; Marckmann, Georg; Munthe, Christian; Wild, Verina",Ethics Inf Technol,,571

260682,[COVID-19 in european urology : Which lessons have we learned?]/ COVID-19 in der europäischen Urologie : Was haben wir bisher gelernt?,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccines are approved, vaccination campaigns are launched, and worldwide return to normality seems within close reach. Nevertheless, concerns about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines arose, due to their fast emergency approval. In fact, the problem of antibody-dependent enhancement was raised in the context of COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We introduce a complex extension of the model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) to optimize vaccination strategies with regard to the onset of campaigns, vaccination coverage, vaccination schedules, vaccination rates, and efficiency of vaccines. Vaccines are not assumed to immunize perfectly. Some individuals fail to immunize, some reach only partial immunity, and-importantly-some develop antibody-dependent enhancement, which increases the likelihood of developing symptomatic and severe episodes (associated with higher case fatality) upon infection. Only a fraction of the population will be vaccinated, reflecting vaccination hesitancy or contraindications. The model is intended to facilitate decision making by exploring ranges of parameters rather than to be fitted by empirical data. We parameterized the model to reflect the situation in Germany and predict increasing incidence (and prevalence) in early 2021 followed by a decline by summer. Assuming contact reductions (curfews, social distancing, etc.) to be lifted in summer, disease incidence will peak again. Fast vaccine deployment contributes to reduce disease incidence in the first quarter of 2021, and delay the epidemic outbreak after the summer season. Higher vaccination coverage results in a delayed and reduced epidemic peak. A coverage of 75%-80% is necessary to prevent an epidemic peak without further drastic contact reductions. CONCLUSIONS: With the vaccine becoming available, compliance with contact reductions is likely to fade. To prevent further economic damage from COVID-19, high levels of immunization need to be reached before next year's flu season, and vaccination strategies and disease management need to be flexibly adjusted. The predictive model can serve as a refined decision support tool for COVID-19 management.","Adil Mahmoud Yousif, Nessma; Tsoungui Obama, Henri Christian Junior; Ngucho Mbeutchou, Yvan Jordan; Kwamou Ngaha, Sandy Frank; Kayanula, Loyce; Kamanga, George; Ibrahim, Toheeb Babatunde; Bwanu Iliya, Patience; Iyanda, Sulyman; Alawam Nemer, Looli; Helle, Kristina Barbara; Teboh-Ewungkem, Miranda Ijang; Schneider, Kristan Alexander",PLoS One,,571

260885,A Biomedically oriented automatically annotated Twitter COVID-19 Dataset,2021-07-27,"BACKGROUND: The more infectious SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 rapidly spread in Europe after December, 2020, and a concern that B.1.1.7 could cause more severe disease has been raised. Taking advantage of Denmark's high RT-PCR testing and whole genome sequencing capacities, we used national health register data to assess the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation in individuals infected with B.1.1.7 compared with those with other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. METHODS: We did an observational cohort study of all SARS-CoV-2-positive cases confirmed by RT-PCR in Denmark, sampled between Jan 1 and March 24, 2021, with 14 days of follow-up for COVID-19 hospitalisation. Cases were identified in the national COVID-19 surveillance system database, which includes data from the Danish Microbiology Database (RT-PCR test results), the Danish COVID-19 Genome Consortium, the National Patient Registry, the Civil Registration System, as well as other nationwide registers. Among all cases, COVID-19 hospitalisation was defined as first admission lasting longer than 12 h within 14 days of a sample with a positive RT-PCR result. The study population and main analysis were restricted to the proportion of cases with viral genome data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) of admission according to infection with B.1.1.7 versus other co-existing lineages with a Poisson regression model with robust SEs, adjusted a priori for sex, age, calendar time, region, and comorbidities. The contribution of each covariate to confounding of the crude RR was evaluated afterwards by a stepwise forward inclusion. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1 and March 24, 2021, 50 958 individuals with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and at least 14 days of follow-up for hospitalisation were identified; 30 572 (60·0%) had genome data, of whom 10 544 (34·5%) were infected with B.1.1.7. 1944 (6·4%) individuals had a COVID-19 hospitalisation and of these, 571 (29·4%) had a B.1.1.7 infection and 1373 (70·6%) had an infection with other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Although the overall number of hospitalisations decreased during the study period, the proportion of individuals infected with B.1.1.7 increased from 3·5% to 92·1% per week. B.1.1.7 was associated with a crude RR of hospital admission of 0·79 (95% CI 0·72-0·87; p<0·0001) and an adjusted RR of 1·42 (95% CI 1·25-1·60; p<0·0001). The adjusted RR was increased in all strata of age and calendar period-the two covariates with the largest contribution to confounding of the crude RR. INTERPRETATION: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 was associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation compared with that of other lineages in an analysis adjusted for covariates. The overall effect on hospitalisations in Denmark was lessened due to a strict lockdown, but our findings could support hospital preparedness and modelling of the projected impact of the epidemic in countries with uncontrolled spread of B.1.1.7.

262655,Critical juncture: The doctor of nursing practice and COVID-19,2021,"The second wave of COVID-19 in Malaysia is largely attributed to a four-day mass gathering held in Sri Petaling from February 27, 2020, which contributed to an exponential rise of COVID-19 cases in the country. Starting from March 18, 2020, the Malaysian government introduced four consecutive phases of a Movement Control Order (MCO) to stem the spread of COVID-19. The MCO was implemented through various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The reported number of cases reached its peak by the first week of April and then started to reduce, hence proving the effectiveness of the MCO. To gain a quantitative understanding of the effect of MCO on the dynamics of COVID-19, this paper develops a class of mathematical models to capture the disease spread before and after MCO implementation in Malaysia. A heterogeneous variant of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model is developed with additional compartments for asymptomatic transmission. Further, a change-point is incorporated to model disease dynamics before and after intervention which is inferred based on data. Related statistical analyses for inference are developed in a Bayesian framework and are able to provide quantitative assessments of (1) the impact of the Sri Petaling gathering, and (2) the extent of decreasing transmission during the MCO period. The analysis here also quantitatively demonstrates how quickly transmission rates fall under effective NPI implementation within a short time period. The models and methodology used provided important insights into the nature of local transmissions to decision makers in the Ministry of Health, Malaysia.","Dass, Sarat C; Kwok, Wai M; Gibson, Gavin J; Gill, Balvinder S; Sundram, Bala M; Singh, Sarbhan",PLoS One,,571

263404,Research on Covid-19 from Biophysical Perspective,2020,"Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a nationwide lockdown is imposed in India initially for three weeks from 24th March to 14th April 2020 and extended up to 3rd May 2020. Due to the forced restrictions, pollution level in cities across the country drastically slowed down just within few days which magnetize discussions regarding lockdown to be the effectual alternative measures to be implemented for controlling air pollution. The present article eventually worked on this direction to look upon the air quality scenario amidst the lockdown period scientifically with special reference to the megacity Delhi. With the aid of air quality data of seven pollutant parameters (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, O3 and NH3) for 34 monitoring stations spread over the megacity we have employed National Air Quality Index (NAQI) to show the spatial pattern of air quality in pre and during-lockdown phases. The results demonstrated that during lockdown air quality is significantly improved. Among the selected pollutants, concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 have witnessed maximum reduction (>50%) in compare to the pre-lockdown phase. In compare to the last year (i.e. 2019) during the said time period the reduction of PM10 and PM2.5 is as high as about 60% and 39% respectively. Among other pollutants, NO2 (-52.68%) and CO (-30.35%) level have also reduced during-lockdown phase. About 40% to 50% improvement in air quality is identified just after four days of commencing lockdown. About 54%, 49%, 43%, 37% and 31% reduction in NAQI have been observed in Central, Eastern, Southern, Western and Northern parts of the megacity. Overall, the study is thought to be a useful supplement to the regulatory bodies since it showed the pollution source control can attenuate the air quality. Temporary such source control in a suitable time interval may heal the environment.","Mahato, Susanta; Pal, Swades; Ghosh, Krishna Gopal",Sci Total Environ,,571
263453,COVID-19: what role for ethics committees?,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical and surgical practice, educational activities, health and lifestyle behavior of Brazilian urology residents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A web-based survey was sent to 468 Brazilian urology residents from postgraduate years (PGY) 3 to 5 to collect data on clinical practice and training after 4 months of COVID-19. We also assessed health-related and behavior changes, rate of infection by SARS-CoV-2, deployment to the front line of COVID-19, residents' concerns, and access to personal protective equipment (PPE). RESULTS: Massive reductions in elective and emergency patient consultations, diagnostic procedures and surgeries were reported across the country, affecting PGY 3 to 5 alike. Most in-person educational activities were abolished. The median damage to the urological training expected for 2020 was 6.0 [3.4 -7.7], on a scale from 0 to 10, with senior residents estimating a greater damage (P < 0.001). Educational interventions developed included online case-based discussions, subspeciality conferences and lectures, and grand rounds. Most senior residents favored extending residency to compensate for training loss and most younger residents favored no additional training (p< 0.001). Modifications in health and lifestyle included weight gain (43.8%), reduced physical activity (68.6%), increased alcoholic intake (44.9%) and cigarette consumption (53.6%), worsening of sexual life (25.2%) and feelings of sadness or depression (48,2%). Almost half were summoned to work on the COVID-19 front-line and 24.4% had COVID-19. Most residents had inadequate training to deal with COVID-19 patients and most reported a shortage of PPE. Residents' concerns included the risk of contaminating family members, being away from residency program, developing severe COVID-19 and overloading colleagues. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had a massive impact in Brazilian urology residents´ training, health and lifestyle behavior, which may reflect what happened in other medical specialties. Studies should confirm these findings to help developing strategies to mitigate residents' losses.","Prezotti, José Antonio; Henriques, João Victor T; Favorito, Luciano A; Canalini, Alfredo F; Machado, Marcos G; Brandão, Thulio B V; Barbosa, Akemi M V; Moromizato, Julyana K M; Anzolch, Karin M J; Fernandes, Roni de C; Rodrigues, Fransber R A; Bellucci, Carlos H S; Silva, Caroline S; Pompeo, Antonio Carlos L; de Bessa, Jose; Gomes, Cristiano M",Int Braz J Urol,,571

264662,A quantitative compendium of COVID-19 epidemiology,2020-06-01,"The novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, has quickly spread across the world and pose serious threat to public health because it can infect people very easily. The major clinical symptoms of 2019-nCoV infection include fever, dry cough, myalgia, fatigue, and diarrhea. The 2019-nCoV belongs to the betacoronavirus family, and gene sequencing results demonstrate that it is a single-stranded RNA virus, closely related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). It has been observed that the virus invades human body mainly through binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors similar to SARS-CoV and the main protease (Mpro) acts as a critical protease for digesting the polyprotein into functional polypeptides during the replication and transcription process of 2019-nCoV. In this review, we summarized the real-time information of 2019-nCoV treatment methods and mainly focused on the chemical drugs including lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir and other potential innovative active molecules. Their potential targets, activity, clinical status and side effects are described. In addition, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) and biological reagents available, as well as the promising vaccine candidates against 2019-nCoV are also discussed.","Zheng, Lu; Zhang, Lina; Huang, Jiamin; Nandakumar, Kutty Selva; Liu, Shuwen; Cheng, Kui",Eur J Med Chem,,571

METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who gave birth from March 13 to April 12, 2020, identified at five New York City medical centers. Demographic and clinical data from delivery hospitalization records were collected, and follow-up was completed on April 20, 2020. RESULTS: Among this cohort (241 women), using evolving criteria for testing, 61.4% of women were asymptomatic for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at the time of admission. Throughout the delivery hospitalization, 26.5% of women met World Health Organization criteria for mild COVID-19, 26.1% for severe, and 5% for critical. Cesarean birth was the mode of delivery for 52.4% of women with severe and 91.7% with critical COVID-19. The singleton preterm birth rate was 14.6%. Admission to the intensive care unit was reported for 17 women (7.1%), and nine (3.7%) were intubated during their delivery hospitalization. There were no maternal deaths. Body mass index (BMI) 30 or higher was associated with COVID-19 severity (P=.001). Nearly all newborns tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection immediately after birth (97.5%). CONCLUSION: During the first month of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in New York City and with evolving testing criteria, most women with laboratory-confirmed infection admitted for delivery did not have symptoms of COVID-19. Almost one third of women who were asymptomatic on admission became symptomatic during their delivery hospitalization. Obesity was associated with COVID-19 severity. Disease severity was associated with higher rates of cesarean and preterm birth.","Khoury, Rasha; Bernstein, Peter S; Debolt, Chelsea; Stone, Joanne; Sutton, Desmond M; Simpson, Lynn L; Limaye, Meghana A; Roman, Ashley S; Fazzari, Melissa; Penfield, Christina A; Ferrara, Lauren; Lambert, Calvin; Nathan, Lisa; Wright, Rodney; Bianco, Angela; Wagner, Brian; Goffman, Dena; Gyamfi-Bannerman, Cynthia; Schweizer, William E; Avila, Karina; Khaksari, Bijan; Proehl, Meghan; Heitor, Fabiano; Monro, Johanna; Keefe, David L; DÊ¼Alton, Mary E; Brodman, Michael; Makhija, Sharmila K; Dolan, Siobhan M",Obstet Gynecol,,571
264766,'Knowing What's Best': Community Partnerships Against COVID-19,2020,"The effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic upon human health, economic activity and social engagement have been swift and far reaching Emerging evidence shows that the pandemic has had dramatic mental health impacts, bringing about increased anxiety and greater social isolation due to the physical distancing policies introduced to control the disease In this context, it is possible to more deeply appreciate the health consequences of loneliness and social isolation, which researchers have argued are enduring experiences for many people and under-recognised contributors to public health In this paper, we examine the social and psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on what this has revealed about the need to better understand and respond to social isolation and loneliness as public health priorities Social isolation and loneliness are understood to be distinct conditions, yet each has been found to predict premature mortality, depression, cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline Estimates of the prevalence and distribution of social isolation and loneliness vary, possibly ranging from one-in-six to one-in-four people, and the lack of knowledge about the extent of these conditions indicates the need for population monitoring using standardised methods and validated measures Reviews of the evidence relating to social isolation and loneliness interventions have found that befriending schemes, individual and group therapies, various shared activity programs, social prescription by healthcare providers, and diverse strategies using information and communication technologies have been tried There remains uncertainty about what is effective for different population groups, particularly for prevention and for addressing the more complex condition of loneliness In Australia, a national coalition - Ending Loneliness Together - has been established to bring together researchers and service providers to facilitate evidence gathering and the mobilisation of knowledge into practice Research-practice partnerships and cross-disciplinary collaborations of this sort are essential for overcoming the public health problems of loneliness and social isolation that have pre-existed and will endure beyond the COVID-19 pandemic","Smith, B.

264925,Discussion of the Classified Management of County Medical Institutions in COVID-19 Epidemic Situa? tion,2020,"This paper presents TrollHunter, an automated reasoning mechanism we used to hunt for trolls on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Trolls, poised to disrupt the online discourse and spread disinformation, quickly seized the absence of a credible response to COVID-19 and created a COVID-19 infodemic by promulgating dubious content on Twitter. To counter the COVID-19 infodemic, the TrollHunter leverages a unique linguistic analysis of a multi-dimensional set of Twitter content features to detect whether or not a tweet was meant to troll. TrollHunter achieved 98.5% accuracy, 75.4% precision and 69.8% recall over a dataset of 1.3 million tweets. Without a final resolution of the pandemic in sight, it is unlikely that the trolls will go away, although they might be forced to evade automated hunting. To explore the plausibility of this strategy, we developed and tested an adversarial machine learning mechanism called TrollHunter-Evader. TrollHunter-Evader employs a Test Time Evasion (TTE) approach in a combination with a Markov chain-based mechanism to recycle originally trolling tweets. The recycled tweets were able to achieve a remarkable 40% decrease in the TrollHunter's ability to correctly identify trolling tweets. Because the COVID-19 infodemic could have a harmful impact on the COVID-19 pandemic, we provide an elaborate discussion about the implications of employing adversarial machine learning to evade Twitter troll hunts.","Jachim, Peter; Sharevski, Filipo; Treebridge, Paige",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.02586v2.pdf,571

264977,Impact of glycoscience in fighting Covid-19,2020,"The vulnerability thesis is one of the most important legal concepts in contemporary legal theory. Apart from being studied by legal scholars, the notion of vulnerability has been embodied in concrete legal rules and transferred to national case law allowing courts to set its boundaries by the power of judicial interpretation. Even though it would be hard to contest Schroeder and Gefenas's statement that it is not necessary for an academic to say what vulnerability is because common sense dictates the existence of it, recent scholarly analysis clearly shows that the concept itself has become intolerably vague and slippery. More precisely, it is not quite clear what the essence of vulnerability is and what the effects of its gradation as well as repercussions are on other constitutional institutes across the human rights spectrum. The noted vagueness poses a great concern, particularly in the time of COVID-19, the greatest social stressor that humanity has faced in recent months. The COVID-19 crisis has had untold consequences on our health, mental well-being, educational growth, and economic stability. In order for the state to bear the COVID-19 social burden and adequately protect the vulnerable, it is of the utmost importance to set clear guidance for the interpretation and implementation of the vulnerability concept. Seeking to contribute to literature on these issues, the author brings light to constitutional and criminal legal standards on vulnerability set within the current jurisprudence and doctrine. Bearing in mind the influence of the European Court of Human Rights (hereinafter, the ECtHR or the Court) on developments in human rights law, 196 judgments related to vulnerability have been retrieved from the HUDOC database using a keywords search strategy. The quantitative analysis was supplemented with more in-depth qualitative linguistic research of the Court's reasoning in cases concerning vulnerable children, persons suffering from mental illness and victims of family violence. Although the vulnerability reasoning has considerably expended their rights within the ambit of the Convention, the analysis has shown that inconsistencies and ambiguities emerge around the formulation of the applicant's vulnerability and its gradation with respect to positive obligations. The full creative and transformative potential of the institute of vulnerability is yet to be realized.","Rittossa, D.",Eu 2021 - the Future of the Eu in and after the Pandemic,,571

Randomized trials demonstrated efficacy of the single-dose Ad26.COV2.S COVID vaccine but data on longer-term protection in clinical practice and effectiveness against variants are needed. ObjectiveTo assess the effectiveness of Ad26.COV2.S in preventing COVID infections and COVID-related hospitalizations in clinical practice, the longer-term stability of its protective effect and effectiveness against Delta variants. DesignCohort study of newly Ad26.COV2.S-vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. SettingU.S. insurance claims data through July 2021. ParticipantsIndividuals 18 years and older newly vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S and up to 10 unvaccinated individuals matched exactly by age, sex, date, location, comorbidity index plus 17 COVID-19 risk factors via propensity score (PS) matching. InterventionVaccination with Ad26.COV2.S versus no vaccination. Main outcomesWe estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) for observed COVID-19 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization, nationwide and stratified by age, immunocompromised status, calendar time, and states with high incidence of the Delta variant. We corrected VE estimates for under-recording of vaccinations in insurance data. ResultsAmong 390,517 vaccinated and 1,524,153 matched unvaccinated individuals, VE was 79% (95% CI, 77% to 80%) for COVID-19 and 81% (79% to 84%) for COVID-19-related hospitalizations. VE was stable over calendar time. Among states with high Delta variant incidence, VE during June/July 2021 was 78% (73% to 82%) for infections and 85% (73% to 91%) for hospitalizations. VE for COVID-19 was higher in individuals <50 years (83%; 81% to 85%) and lower in immunocompromised patients (64%; 57% to 70%). All estimates were corrected for under-recording; uncorrected VE was 69% (67% to 71%) and 73% (69% to 76%), for COVID-19 and COVID-19-related hospitalization, respectively. ConclusionsThese non-randomized data across U.S. clinical practices show high and stable vaccine effectiveness of Ad26.COV2.S over time before the Delta variant emerged to when the Delta variant was dominant.","Polinski, Jennifer M.; Weckstein, Andrew R.; Batech, Michael; Kabelac, Carly; Kamath, Tripthi; Harvey, Raymond; Jain, Sid; Rassen, Jeremy A.; Khan, Najat; Schneeweiss, Sebastian",,,571

However, it is also important for clinicians and epidemiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases such as influenza viruses. RESEARCH QUESTION: The aim of this study was to explore the different clinical presentations between COVID-19 and influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia in patients with ARDS. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This analysis was a retrospective case-control study. Two independent cohorts of patients with ARDS infected with either COVID-19 (n = 73) or H1N1 (n = 75) were compared. Their clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, treatments, and prognosis were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: The median age of patients with COVID-19 was higher than that of patients with H1N1, and there was a higher proportion of male subjects among the H1N1 cohort (P < .05). Patients with COVID-19 exhibited higher proportions of nonproductive coughs, fatigue, and GI symptoms than those of patients with H1N1 (P < .05). Patients with H1N1 had higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores than patients with COVID-19 (P < .05). The Pao2/Fio2 of 198.5 mm Hg in the COVID-19 cohort was significantly higher than the Pao2/Fio2 of 107.0 mm Hg in the H1N1 cohort (P < .001). Ground-glass opacities was more common in patients with COVID-19 than in patients with H1N1 (P < .001). There was a greater variety of antiviral therapies administered to COVID-19 patients than to H1N1 patients. The in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19 was 28.8%, whereas that of patients with H1N1 was 34.7% (P = .483). SOFA score-adjusted mortality of H1N1 patients was significantly higher than that of COVID-19 patients, with a rate ratio of 2.009 (95% CI, 1.563-2.583; P < .001). INTERPRETATION: There were many differences in clinical presentations between patients with ARDS infected with either COVID-19 or H1N1. Compared with H1N1 patients, patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS had lower severity of illness scores at presentation and lower SOFA score-adjusted mortality.","Tang, Xiao; Du, Rong-Hui; Wang, Rui; Cao, Tan-Ze; Guan, Lu-Lu; Yang, Cheng-Qing; Zhu, Qi; Hu, Ming; Li, Xu-Yan; Li, Ying; Liang, Li-Rong; Tong, Zhao-Hui; Sun, Bing; Peng, Peng; Shi, Huan-Zhong",Chest,,571

Of particular concern is the potential for significant respiratory, cardiovascular, physical, and psychological dysfunctions. AREAS COVERED: In this context, the current review will focus on the following areas: 1) staying physically active during the COVID-19 pandemic; 2) highlighting the importance of understanding COVID-19 mechanisms; 3) preventing infections for healthcare workers by using personal protective equipment; 4) highlighting importance of respiratory care and physical therapy during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19; and 5) facilitating referral to a rehabilitation program in patients recovering from COVID-19. EXPERT OPINION: We recommend daily physical exercise, outdoors or at home, as physical exercise increases the synthesis of anti-inflammatory cytokines; Patients with COVID-19 may develop severe acute respiratory syndrome, hypoxemia, diffuse alveolar damage, ACE2 reduction in the cardiovascular system and muscle weakness acquired through a prolonged hospital stay; The role of the physiotherapist in the hospital environment is of fundamental importance-early mobilization is highly recommended in severe cases of COVID-19.","Goulart, Cássia da Luz; Silva, Rebeca Nunes; Oliveira, Murilo Rezende; Guizilini, Solange; Rocco, Isadora Salvador; Mendez, Vanessa Marques Ferreira; Bonjorno, José Carlos; Caruso, Flavia Rossi; Arena, Ross; Borghi-Silva, Audrey",Expert rev. ant. infect. ther,,571

This article presents a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to ascertain if methylprednisolone can be recommended for use in patients with COVID-19 to prevent deaths. METHODS: Systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and preprint servers until 13 April 2021. The outcome of interest was all-cause mortality. The random-effects model for the meta-analysis was utilized to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR) at 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Five RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled OR for all-cause mortality was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.29 - 1.43, n = 652) comparing methylprednisolone with the control, indicating no mortality benefits. A similar finding was noted with a sub-group analysis including four trials that used low-dose methylprednisolone. However, the only trial that administered high dose methylprednisolone indicated a statistically significant mortality benefit (OR 0.08, 95% CI: 0.02-0.42). CONCLUSIONS: In determining equipotent doses for an acute short-course pulse therapy of corticosteroids, the biological half-life of steroids should also be accounted for besides the potency factor. A short duration (3-5 days) pulse therapy of high-dose methylprednisolone can be a promising alternative to the low-dose dexamethasone therapy in severely ill patients with COVID-19 to prevent deaths.","Hasan, Syed Shahzad; Kow, Chia Siang; Mustafa, Zia Ul; Merchant, Hamid A",Expert Rev Respir Med,,571

Although clinical reports indicate that ORF8 variant strains (&#916;382 and L84S variants) are less likely to cause severe illness, functional differences between wild-type and variant ORF8 are unknown. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of the ORF8 protein have not been analyzed. In this study, the physicochemical properties of the wild-type ORF8 and its L84S variant were analyzed and compared. Using the tobacco BY-2 cell production system, which has been successfully used to produce the wild-type ORF8 protein with a single conformation, was used to successfully produce the ORF8 L84S variant protein at the same level as wild-type ORF8. The produced proteins were purified, and their temperature and pH dependencies were examined using nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. Our data suggested that the wild-type and L84S variant ORF8 structures are highly stable over a wide temperature range. Both proteins displayed an aggregated conformation at higher temperature that reverted when the temperature was decreased to room temperature. Moreover, ORF8 precipitated at acidic pH and this precipitation was reversed when the solution pH was shifted to neutral. Interestingly, the L84S variant exhibited greater solubility than wild-type ORF8 under acidic conditions. Thus, the finding indicated that conformational stability and reversibility of ORF8 are key properties related to function in oppressive environments.","Ohki, Shinya; Imamura, Tomohiro; Higashimura, Yasuki; Matsumoto, Kenji; Mori, Masashi",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,571

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chest CT images of 72 symptomatic patients with corona virus disease (COVID-19) were analyzed retrospectively, including 44 younger patients (47.5±8.7 y old) and 28 older patients (68.4±6.0 y old). CT findings including density (pure ground-glass opacities, ground-glass opacities with consolidation, consolidation), the number of lobes involved, lesion distribution, and the main accompanying signs were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Characteristic CT findings included the lobes of bilateral lung extensively involved, ground-glass opacity and ground-glass opacity with consolidation in the peripheral area, sometimes accompanied by interlobular septal thickening, and subpleural line and pleural thickening. Compared with the younger group, the proportion of extensive involvement of lung lobes was higher in the elderly group (71.4% vs. 36.4%, P=0.009), and subpleural line and pleural thickening were more likely to occur (50.0% vs. 25.0%, and 71.4% vs. 40.9%, P=0.030 and 0.011, respectively). CONCLUSION: Elderly and younger patients with corona virus disease have some common CT features, but older patients are more likely to have extensive lung lobe involvement, and subpleural line and pleural thickening. These differentiated characteristics may be related to the progress and prognosis of the disease.","Zhu, Tingting; Wang, Yujin; Zhou, Shuchang; Zhang, Na; Xia, Liming",J Thorac Imaging,,571
268403,Coronavirus-related Hospital Admissions in the United States in 2016-2017,2020,"Tuberculosis (TB) disease incidence has decreased steadily since 1993 (1), a result of decades of work by local TB programs to detect, treat, and prevent TB disease and transmission. During 2020, a total of 7,163 TB cases were provisionally reported to CDC's National Tuberculosis Surveillance System (NTSS) by the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia (DC), a relative reduction of 20%, compared with the number of cases reported during 2019.* TB incidence per 100,000 persons was 2.2 during 2020, compared with 2.7 during 2019. Since 2010, TB incidence has decreased by an average of 2%-3% annually (1). Pandemic mitigation efforts and reduced travel might have contributed to the reported decrease. The magnitude and breadth of the decrease suggest potentially missed or delayed TB diagnoses. Health care providers should consider TB disease when evaluating patients with signs and symptoms consistent with TB (e.g., cough of >2 weeks in duration, unintentional weight loss, and hemoptysis), especially when diagnostic tests are negative for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In addition, members of the public should be encouraged to follow up with their health care providers for any respiratory illness that persists or returns after initial treatment. The steep, unexpected decline in TB cases raises concerns of missed cases, and further work is in progress to better understand factors associated with the decline.","Deutsch-Feldman, Molly; Pratt, Robert H; Price, Sandy F; Tsang, Clarisse A; Self, Julie L",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,571

268704,Diagnostic dilemma in COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis,2021,"The coronavirus disease outbreak in China has become the world's leading health headline and is causing major panic and public concerns. Public health guidelines in many countries are suggesting that people stay at home to avoid human-to-human transmission of the virus, which may lead to reduced physical activity and greater feelings of isolation. Such effects may be particularly problematic in older adults due to their reduced physical capacities and their potential for increased mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression. A potential way to minimize many of these side effects of stay-at-home guidelines may be progressive home-based resistance training. A simple way to provide progressive overload in home-based resistance training may involve elastic resistance, which has been demonstrated to provide similar benefits to traditional resistance training equipment typically found in gymnasiums. Recommendations on how older adults can safely and effectively perform elastic resistance training at home are provided.","Marcos-Pardo, Pablo Jorge; Espeso-García, Alejandro; López-Vivancos, Abraham; Abelleira Lamela, Tomás; Keogh, Justin W L",J Aging Phys Act,,571

268745,Scientific production in online journals about the new coronavirus (covid-19): bibliometric research,2020,"During the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, neurological symptoms increasingly moved into the focus of interest. In this prospective cohort study, we assessed neurological and cognitive symptoms in hospitalized coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients and aimed to determine their neuronal correlates. Patients with reverse transcription-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection who required inpatient treatment primarily because of non-neurological complications were screened between 20 April 2020 and 12 May 2020. Patients (age > 18 years) were included in our cohort when presenting with at least one new neurological symptom (defined as impaired gustation and/or olfaction, performance < 26 points on a Montreal Cognitive Assessment and/or pathological findings on clinical neurological examination). Patients with &#8805;2 new symptoms were eligible for further diagnostics using comprehensive neuropsychological tests, cerebral MRI and 18fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET as soon as infectivity was no longer present. Exclusion criteria were: premorbid diagnosis of cognitive impairment, neurodegenerative diseases or intensive care unit treatment. Of 41 COVID-19 inpatients screened, 29 patients (65.2 ± 14.4 years; 38% female) in the subacute stage of disease were included in the register. Most frequently, gustation and olfaction were disturbed in 29/29 and 25/29 patients, respectively. Montreal Cognitive Assessment performance was impaired in 18/26 patients (mean score 21.8/30) with emphasis on frontoparietal cognitive functions. This was confirmed by detailed neuropsychological testing in 15 patients. 18FDG PET revealed pathological results in 10/15 patients with predominant frontoparietal hypometabolism. This pattern was confirmed by comparison with a control sample using voxel-wise principal components analysis, which showed a high correlation (R2 = 0.62) with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment performance. Post-mortem examination of one patient revealed white matter microglia activation but no signs of neuroinflammation. Neocortical dysfunction accompanied by cognitive decline was detected in a relevant fraction of patients with subacute COVID-19 initially requiring inpatient treatment. This is of major rehabilitative and socioeconomic relevance.","Hosp, Jonas A; Dressing, Andrea; Blazhenets, Ganna; Bormann, Tobias; Rau, Alexander; Schwabenland, Marius; Thurow, Johannes; Wagner, Dirk; Waller, Cornelius; Niesen, Wolf D; Frings, Lars; Urbach, Horst; Prinz, Marco; Weiller, Cornelius; Schroeter, Nils; Meyer, Philipp T",Brain,,571

Building upon studies from various countries, we aimed to investigate (1) the prevalence of various work-related stressors among healthcare professionals in Germany specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) the psychological effects of these stressors in terms of clinical symptoms, and (3) the healthcare professionals' help-seeking behaviour. To this end, N = 300 healthcare professionals completed an online survey including the ICD-10 Symptom Rating checklist (ISR), event-sampling questions on pandemic-related stressors and self-formulated questions on help-seeking behaviour. Participants were recruited between 22 May and 22 July 2020. Findings were analysed using t tests, regressions and comparisons to large clinical and non-clinical samples assessed before and during the pandemic. Results show that healthcare professionals were most affected by protective measures at their workplace and changes in work procedures. Psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety and depression, were significantly more severe than in a non-clinical pre-pandemic sample and in the general population during the pandemic. At the same time, most professionals indicated that they would not seek help for psychological concerns. These findings indicate that healthcare employers need to pay greater attention to the mental health of their staff.","Weibelzahl, S; Reiter, J; Duden, G",Epidemiol Infect,,571

It results in the partitioning of the square into contiguous and non-overlapping blocks. Interestingly, we find that the dynamics of WPSL1 is governed by infinitely many conservation laws and each of the conserved quantities, except the trivial conservation of total mass or area, is a multifractal measure. On the other hand, the dual of the lattice is a scale-free network as its degree distribution exhibits a power-law $P(k)\sim k^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma=4.13$. The network is also a small-world network as we find that (i) the total clustering coefficient $C$ is high and independent of the network size and (ii) the mean geodesic path length grows logarithmically with $N$. Besides, the clustering coefficient $C_k$ of the nodes which have degree $k$ decreases exactly as $2/(k-1)$ revealing that it is also a nested hierarchical network.","Mitra, Tushar; Hassan, Md.

To fill this gap, the present study explores causes of and solutions to boredom as well as the time of class deemed more/less boring by 208 English major students in Iran. Drawing on maximum variation sampling, the data, collected through a written, open-ended questionnaire and semi-structured interviews, were thematically analyzed through MAXQDA (Version 2020) to derive themes relating to the issues under investigation. Findings revealed that (1) teachers’ long, monotonous monologues, lack of student participation, logistical problems, and carelessly chosen, repetitive tasks were the main sources of boredom;(2) most of the suggested solutions revolved around making the class livelier through more teacher-student interaction, improving inter-personal relationships, and solving technological problems;and (3) although boredom may be experienced throughout online English classes, even at the outset, it tends to reach its apex towards the end. The findings are discussed in terms of lessons for teachers and teacher educators to improve the experience of online English education during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Derakhshan, Ali Kruk Mariusz Mehdizadeh Mostafa Pawlak Mirosław",System,,571

269632,Genetics and COVID-19: How to Protect the Susceptible (preprint),2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages in spring 2020, necessitating crisis protocols. METHODS: An online survey was administered to all Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology members in October, 2020 to assess PPE availability and crisis standards utilized in fall, 2020. RESULTS: In total, 1,081 infection preventionists participated. A quarter lacked sufficient disinfection supplies, N95s, isolation gowns, and gloves; 10%-20% lacked eye protection and hand hygiene supplies. Significantly more were reusing respirators than masks (65.6% vs 46.8%, respectively; P < .001); a third (32.0%, nâ¯=â¯735) were reusing isolation gowns. About half (45.9%, nâ¯=â¯496) were decontaminating respirators. Determinants of believing current PPE reuse protocols were safe and evidence-based included the infection preventionists being involved in developing COVID-19 protocols (both), having respirator reuse protocols that involve &#8804; 5 reuses (both), using reusable respiratory protection (both), decontaminating respirators (perceived safe), and not reusing masks (perceived safe; P < .05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Although most health care facilities had adequate PPE in fall 2020, PPE supply chains were still disrupted, resulting in the need to reuse or decontaminate PPE. Ongoing gaps in PPE access need to be addressed in order to minimize health care associated infections and occupational illness.","Rebmann, Terri; Alvino, Rebecca T; Holdsworth, Jill E",Am J Infect Control,,571

Therefore, finding a symptom with a high predictive value would help in diagnostic and isolation strategies. OBJECTIVE: To correlate the sudden loss of the sense of smell in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic with results of diagnostic tests for COVID-19. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional observational study. An online questionnaire was digitally addressed to 725 outpatients in Brazil who reported partial or total sudden loss of the sense of smell from March to April 2020. RESULTS: Total or partial sudden loss of the sense of smell showed high positive predictive value for COVID-19 diagnosis, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil (88.8%). There were no differences between groups tested positive and negative in regard to demographic and clinical characteristics such as presence of allergy, rhinitis, neither to olfactory recovery time. CONCLUSION: The identification of sudden loss of the sense of smell during COVID-19 pandemic may serve as a sentinel symptom and may be a warning to establish measures to prevent the transmission of the disease.","Joffily, Lucia; Ungierowicz, Aluan; David, Andrea Goldwasser; Melo, Bruna; Brito, César Leandro Terra; Mello, Luciane; Santos, Priscilla de Souza Campos Dos; Pezato, Rogério",Braz J Otorhinolaryngol,,571

This study aims to assess changes in health services access, self-care, behavioural, and psychological impact of COVID-19 and partial lockdown amongst diabetes patients in Singapore. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey amongst people with diabetes with the Diabetes Health Profile-18 (DHP-18). Hierarchical regression analyses were performed for each DHP-18 subscale (Psychological Distress, Disinhibited Eating and Barriers to Activity) as dependent variables in separate models. RESULTS: Among 301 respondents, 45.2% were women, 67.1% of Chinese ethnicity, 24.2% were aged 40 to 49 years, 68.4% have Type 2 diabetes and 42.2% on oral medications alone. During the pandemic and the lockdown, nearly all respondents were able to receive care safely from the clinics they attend (94%) and obtain their medications and diabetes equipment and supplies (97%) when needed. Respondents reported less frequent engagement in physical activity (38%), checking of blood pressure (29%) and blood glucose (22%). Previous diagnosis of mental health conditions (ß = 9.33, P = .043), Type 1 diabetes (ß = 12.92, P = .023), number of diabetes-related comorbidities (ß = 3.16, P = .007) and Indian ethnicity (ß = 6.65, P = .034) were associated with higher psychological distress. Comorbidities were associated with higher disinhibited eating (ß = 2.49, P = .014) while ability to reach their doctor despite not going to the clinic is negatively associated with psychological distress (ß = -9.50 P = .002) and barriers to activity (ß = -7.53, P = .007). CONCLUSION: Health services access were minimally affected, but COVID-19 and lockdown had mixed impacts on self-care and management behaviours. Greater clinical care and attention should be provided to people with diabetes with multiple comorbidities and previous mental health disorders during the pandemic and lockdown.","Yeoh, Ester; Tan, Soon Guan; Lee, Ying Shan; Tan, Hwee Huan; Low, Ying Yee; Lim, Su Chi; Sum, Chee Fang; Tavintharan, Subramaniam; Wee, Hwee Lin",Int J Clin Pract,,571
270233,Managing the R0 of COVID-19: mathematics fights back,2020,"BACKGROUND: Awake prone positioning (awake-PP) in non-intubated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients could avoid endotracheal intubation, reduce the use of critical care resources, and improve survival. We aimed to examine whether the combination of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNO) with awake-PP prevents the need for intubation when compared to HFNO alone. METHODS: Prospective, multicenter, adjusted observational cohort study in consecutive COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) receiving respiratory support with HFNO from 12 March to 9 June 2020. Patients were classified as HFNO with or without awake-PP. Logistic models were fitted to predict treatment at baseline using the following variables: age, sex, obesity, non-respiratory Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, APACHE-II, C-reactive protein, days from symptoms onset to HFNO initiation, respiratory rate, and peripheral oxyhemoglobin saturation. We compared data on demographics, vital signs, laboratory markers, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, days to intubation, ICU length of stay, and ICU mortality between HFNO patients with and without awake-PP. RESULTS: A total of 1076 patients with COVID-19 ARF were admitted, of which 199 patients received HFNO and were analyzed. Fifty-five (27.6%) were pronated during HFNO; 60 (41%) and 22 (40%) patients from the HFNO and HFNO + awake-PP groups were intubated. The use of awake-PP as an adjunctive therapy to HFNO did not reduce the risk of intubation [RR 0.87 (95% CI 0.53-1.43), p = 0.60]. Patients treated with HFNO + awake-PP showed a trend for delay in intubation compared to HFNO alone [median 1 (interquartile range, IQR 1.0-2.5) vs 2 IQR 1.0-3.0] days (p = 0.055), but awake-PP did not affect 28-day mortality [RR 1.04 (95% CI 0.40-2.72), p = 0.92]. CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19 ARF treated with HFNO, the use of awake-PP did not reduce the need for intubation or affect mortality.","Ferrando, Carlos; Mellado-Artigas, Ricard; Gea, Alfredo; Arruti, Egoitz; Aldecoa, César; Adalia, Ramón; Ramasco, Fernando; Monedero, Pablo; Maseda, Emilio; Tamayo, Gonzalo; Hernández-Sanz, María L; Mercadal, Jordi; Martín-Grande, Ascensión; Kacmarek, Robert M; Villar, Jesús; Suárez-Sipmann, Fernando",Crit Care,,571

These 3-dimensional and self-organizing organotypic cultures derived from adult tissues have been increasingly used in fundamental and translational research. A key feature of this organoid system is that it recapitulates the stem cell lineage and thus, the differentiated cell type heterogeneity of the in vivo tissue of origin. Importantly, we and others have shown that organoids can be manipulated to expand different cell lineages, allowing for the study of rare cell types that would otherwise be very difficult to analyze. Here, focusing specifically on organoids of the small intestine, we discuss recent advances and future directions of this new avenue of organoid research. We highlight methods used to enrich for specific cell types including stem cells, enterocytes, Paneth cells, goblet cells, micro-fold (M)-cells, tuft cells, and enteroendocrine cells (EECs) in intestinal organoids, and focus on what each of these methods has taught us about the differentiation of adult intestinal stem cells (ISCs) to specific cell fates. Furthermore, we highlight how these new cell type-enriched intestinal organoids can be used to answer a diversity of questions relevant to human biology and disease.","Boonekamp, Kim E; Dayton, Talya L; Clevers, Hans",J. mol. cell biol.

271162,COVID-19 Lessons: Compassion and Flexibility are Critical to Equitable Learning,2021,"Infections with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae are emerging as an important challenge in healthcare settings. Currently, carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) are the species of CRE most commonly encountered in hospitals. CRKP is resistant to almost all available antimicrobial agents, and infections with CRKP have been associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, particularly among persons with prolonged hospitalization exposed to invasive devices. We report nine patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU) with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who developed invasive infections due to carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CP-Kp), KPC and OXA-48, strains that have not been previously identified in our hospital. Despite ceftazidime/avibactam therapy, five patients died. Coinfections can contribute to a poor prognosis for patients with COVID-19, especially for high-risk populations such as elderly patients. Therefore, it is crucial to establish a rigorous program of antibiotic administration in intensive care units.","Dumitru, Irina Magdalena Dumitrascu Mirela Vlad Nicoleta Dorina Cernat Roxana Carmen Ilie-Serban Carmen Hangan Aurelia Slujitoru Raluca Elena Gherghina Aura Mitroi-Maxim Corina Curtali Licdan Carp Dalia Sorina Dumitrescu Anca Mitan Romelia Lesanu Rodica Rugina Sorin",Antibiotics,,571
271362,How to Best Predict the Daily Number of New Infections of Covid-19,2020-04-08,"Ocular pain is a common complaint which forces the patient to seek immediate medical attention. It is the primeval first response of the body to any severe condition of the eye such as trauma, infections and inflammation. The pain can be due to conditions directly affecting the eye and ocular adnexa; or indirect which would manifest as referred pain from other organ structures such as the central nervous system. Paradoxically, there are several minor and non-sight threatening conditions, which also leads to ocular pain and does not merit urgent hospital visits. In this perspective, we intend to provide guidelines to the practising ophthalmologist for teleconsultation when a patient complains of pain with focus on how to differentiate the various diagnoses that can be managed over teleconsultation and those requiring emergency care in the clinic. These guidelines can decrease unnecessary hospital visits, which is the need of the hour in the pandemic era and also beyond. Patients who are under quarantine and those who are unable to travel would be benefitted, and at the same time, the burden of increased patient load in busy hospital systems can be reduced.","Murthy, Somasheila I; Das, Sujata; Deshpande, Parul; Kaushik, Sushmita; Dave, Tarjani Vivek; Agashe, Prachi; Goel, Nupur; Soni, Anuj",Indian J Ophthalmol,,571
271379,0087 Suicide in the time of COVID-19: a perfect storm,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 lockdown, referrals via the 2-week-wait urgent pathway for suspected cancer in England, UK, are reported to have decreased by up to 84%. We aimed to examine the impact of different scenarios of lockdown-accumulated backlog in cancer referrals on cancer survival, and the impact on survival per referred patient due to delayed referral versus risk of death from nosocomial infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. METHODS: In this modelling study, we used age-stratified and stage-stratified 10-year cancer survival estimates for patients in England, UK, for 20 common tumour types diagnosed in 2008-17 at age 30 years and older from Public Health England. We also used data for cancer diagnoses made via the 2-week-wait referral pathway in 2013-16 from the Cancer Waiting Times system from NHS Digital. We applied per-day hazard ratios (HRs) for cancer progression that we generated from observational studies of delay to treatment. We quantified the annual numbers of cancers at stage I-III diagnosed via the 2-week-wait pathway using 2-week-wait age-specific and stage-specific breakdowns. From these numbers, we estimated the aggregate number of lives and life-years lost in England for per-patient delays of 1-6 months in presentation, diagnosis, or cancer treatment, or a combination of these. We assessed three scenarios of a 3-month period of lockdown during which 25%, 50%, and 75% of the normal monthly volumes of symptomatic patients delayed their presentation until after lockdown. Using referral-to-diagnosis conversion rates and COVID-19 case-fatality rates, we also estimated the survival increment per patient referred. FINDINGS: Across England in 2013-16, an average of 6281 patients with stage I-III cancer were diagnosed via the 2-week-wait pathway per month, of whom 1691 (27%) would be predicted to die within 10 years from their disease. Delays in presentation via the 2-week-wait pathway over a 3-month lockdown period (with an average presentational delay of 2 months per patient) would result in 181 additional lives and 3316 life-years lost as a result of a backlog of referrals of 25%, 361 additional lives and 6632 life-years lost for a 50% backlog of referrals, and 542 additional lives and 9948 life-years lost for a 75% backlog in referrals. Compared with all diagnostics for the backlog being done in month 1 after lockdown, additional capacity across months 1-3 would result in 90 additional lives and 1662 live-years lost due to diagnostic delays for the 25% backlog scenario, 183 additional lives and 3362 life-years lost under the 50% backlog scenario, and 276 additional lives and 5075 life-years lost under the 75% backlog scenario. However, a delay in additional diagnostic capacity with provision spread across months 3-8 after lockdown would result in 401 additional lives and 7332 life-years lost due to diagnostic delays under the 25% backlog scenario, 811 additional lives and 14â873 life-years lost under the 50% backlog scenario, and 1231 additional lives and 22â635 life-years lost under the 75% backlog scenario. A 2-month delay in 2-week-wait investigatory referrals results in an estimated loss of between 0·0 and 0·7 life-years per referred patient, depending on age and tumour type. INTERPRETATION: Prompt provision of additional capacity to address the backlog of diagnostics will minimise deaths as a result of diagnostic delays that could add to those predicted due to expected presentational delays. Prioritisation of patient groups for whom delay would result in most life-years lost warrants consideration as an option for mitigating the aggregate burden of mortality in patients with cancer.

272261,Color-Coded Activity Charts and Beachbody: “Momming” in COVID-19,2020,"PURPOSE: Acute respiratory illness is the leading cause of hospitalization for young children. Current guidelines recommend against testing to identify specific viruses due to a lack of data on the benefit of such testing. This study was designed to characterize epidemiology, hospital course, and outcomes of the various common virus -related hospitalization in children. METHOD: Single-center retrospective chart review. All patients who had respiratory viral panel sent within 48â¯h of admission. Comparative demographic and outcome analysis. Statistical analysis using ANOVA and multivariable regression. RESULT: 1831 patients met the study criteria. Rhinovirus was the most common virus (55.9%). Coronavirus had the highest proportion of infants (61.2%), while influenza had the least (17.8%). Positive urine culture identified in 8.1% of patients, with blood and urine positivity at 2% each. Rhinovirus and parainfluenza were spread throughout the year, while Corona, RSV, and influenza were more predominant in winter months. Overall PICU admission rate 22.8% and was highest for RSV (28.0%) and lowest for adenovirus (13.5%). No difference in ICU length of stay among different virus. Intubation rate was 5.6% with a median duration of 5 days. Median hospital length of stay was 2 days and differ significantly with different virus (maximum four RSV and metapneumo virus). Mortality in the study population was 0.3%. CONCLUSION: The difference in the disease course of different viruses may justify the resources required to test for the respiratory viral panel. This study data can serve as a benchmark for comparison of disease course of COVID-19 compared to other viral infections.","Tripathi, Sandeep; Al-Sayyed, Ban; Gladfelter, Taylor R",Indian J Med Microbiol,,571

272713,Indonesia's Legal Framework in Combating Covid-19,2020,"RationaleThe novel coronavirus, COVID-19, can cause critical illness in up to 5% of infected patients. Although the sequelae of surviving critical illness are known, limited data exist regarding the psychological and cognitive outcomes specifically in survivors of COVID-19. Given the social isolation, scarcity of multidisciplinary staff, and socio-economic impact of the pandemic, understanding the cognitive and psychological impact of surviving critical illness due to COVID-19 is of utmost importance. MethodsA prospective observational cohort study at an academic medical center enrolled critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Upon hospital discharge, cognitive and psychological sequelae were measured using the following validated assessments: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Impact of Event Score (IES), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS). Cognitive impairment was defined as a MoCA score &lt;26. Probable post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was defined as an IES score &gt;32. Significant symptoms of anxiety and depression were defined as a HADS subscale score of ≥8. ResultsFrom April 10, 2020 through November 17, 2020, 100 adult critically ill patients were enrolled, of which 27 were invasively mechanically ventilated. Eighty-nine patients underwent cognitive and psychological evaluation upon hospital discharge. Of the 11 patients who did not complete the evaluation, 2 died prior to discharge, 4 had significant cognitive impairment, 2 were discharged prior to survey completion, and 3 refused. Cognitive impairment was present in 93% of patients (n=83) with a median MoCA score of 17 [13-22]. Patients with cognitive impairment tended to be older (62 years old [53-71] vs 50 [41-58];p=0.17). Ten patients (11%) had probable PTSD with a median IES score of 4 [0-17] in the overall cohort. Seventeen patients (19%) reported significant depressive symptoms and twenty patients (22%) noted significant symptoms of anxiety. ConclusionPrior coronavirus outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) were associated with anxiety, depression, impaired memory and confusion occurring in approximately one-third of patients at hospital discharge. In contrast, cognitive impairment in ICU survivors of COVID-19 infection was nearly universal on hospital discharge. This impairment is not completely explained by coexistent psychiatric symptoms of anxiety or depression, which were present in only one-fifth of the ICU survivors.","Westrich, J. A.; Wolfe, K.

The explanation for this finding is not entirely clear. The goal of this study was to compare clinical characteristics, inflammatory biomarkers and clinical outcome between men and women. This retrospective study included patients with COVID-19 admitted to 10 Virginia hospitals from January 1, 2020, to June 15, 2020. Demographic data, comorbidities, and inflammatory markers, including C reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, ferritin, and the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, as well as patient outcomes, were compared between men and women. During the study period, 701 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection were admitted. The patient's mean age was 61±17 years. There were 370 men (52.8%). There was no difference in age, racial distribution, and comorbidities in the male patients compared with the female patients. However, both the baseline and peak levels of CRP and ferritin were significantly higher in men as compared with women. While the baseline D-dimer was similar between the sexes, men had a significantly higher maximal D-dimer. Men had evidence of greater disease severity, with a significantly greater admission to the intensive care unit and borderline higher hospital mortality. Our study supports the observation that COVID-19 causes more severe disease in men. The greater disease severity in men was not due to the effect of age or comorbidities; however, in keeping with experimental studies, men had evidence of a heightened inflammatory response, likely contributing to disease severity.","Marik, Paul Ellis; DePerrior, Sarah E; Ahmad, Qamar; Dodani, Sunita",J. invest. med,,571
273997,Predicting covid-19 resurgence: do it locally,2020,"BACKGROUND: A crucial factor in mitigating respiratory viral outbreaks is early determination of the duration of the incubation period and, accordingly, the required quarantine time for potentially exposed individuals. At the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, optimization of quarantine regimes becomes paramount for public health, societal well-being, and global economy. However, biological factors that determine the duration of the virus incubation period remain poorly understood. RESULTS: We demonstrate a strong positive correlation between the length of the incubation period and disease severity for a wide range of human pathogenic viruses. Using a machine learning approach, we develop a predictive model that accurately estimates, solely from several virus genome features, in particular, the number of protein-coding genes and the GC content, the incubation time ranges for diverse human pathogenic RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2. The predictive approach described here can directly help in establishing the appropriate quarantine durations and thus facilitate controlling future outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: The length of the incubation period in viral diseases strongly correlates with disease severity, emphasizing the biological and epidemiological importance of the incubation period. Perhaps, surprisingly, incubation times of pathogenic RNA viruses can be accurately predicted solely from generic features of virus genomes. Elucidation of the biological underpinnings of the connections between these features and disease progression can be expected to reveal key aspects of virus pathogenesis.","Gussow, Ayal B; Auslander, Noam; Wolf, Yuri I; Koonin, Eugene V",BMC Biol,,571

Although dexamethasone has an undeniably beneficial effect on the inflammatory response in a subgroup of patients, the potential negative effects of corticosteroids must also be considered. In view of these negative effects, we argue that a one-size-fits-all dexamethasone approach may be potentially harmful in specific subsets of patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS. We propose a different individually tailored treatment strategy based on the patient's inflammatory response.","Kuindersma, Marnix; Diaz, Rocio Ramos; Spronk, Peter E",Crit Care,,571

The virus subsequently spread worldwide, causing havoc to medical systems and paralyzing global economies. The first COVID-19 patient in Israel was diagnosed on 27 February 2020. OBJECTIVES: To present our findings and experiences as the first and largest center for COVID-19 patients in Israel. METHODS: The current analysis included all COVID-19 patients treated in Sheba Medical Center from February 2020 to April 2020. Clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological data gathered during their hospitalization are presented. RESULTS: Our 162 patient cohort included mostly adult (mean age of 52 ± 20 years) males (65%). Patients classified as severe COVID-19 were significantly older and had higher prevalence of arterial hypertension and diabetes. They also had significantly higher white blood cell counts, absolute neutrophil counts, and lactate dehydrogenase. Low folic acid blood levels were more common amongst severe patients (18.2 vs. 12.9 vs. 9.8, P = 0.014). The rate of immune compromised patients (12%) in our cohort was also higher than in the general population. The rate of deterioration from moderate to severe disease was high: 9% necessitated non-invasive oxygenation and 15% were intubated and mechanically ventilated. The mortality rate was 3.1.

274311,COVID-19 Response Team: A View from the Frontlines,2020,"COVID-19 has intensified and magnified the need of the overdue change in the tourism and hospitality education. COVID-19 has also been a grand global living-lab experiment of accelerated (technology) educational change.

It is the aim of this paper to re-imagine how tourism and hospitality education should re-imagine and re-set its ?business model? for the next normal. To achieve that, the paper first outlines the transformations happening in the major actors of the educational landscape (i.e. students, educational providers, industry and labour markets). Educational change should respond both re-actively and pro-actively to such changes. Hence, the paper continues by advocating how the educational institutions should change in order to not only overcome the crisis but also to lead the re-form of the tourism and hospitality industry to build back better. Changes are proposed in relation to educational offerings, curricula design and content, delivery methods, learning aims and competencies, types and management models of educational instructors, all of them affecting the ?business model? of educational providers including their value proposition, revenue and delivery models.","Sigala, Marianna",Journal of Hospitality &amp; Tourism Research,,571
274525,Is COVID-19 Gender-sensitive?,2021,"Objectives Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an anti-malarial and immunomodulatory drug reported to inhibit the Corona virus, SARS-CoV-2, in vitro. At present there is insufficient evidence from clinical trials to determine the safety and efficacy of HCQ as a treatment for COVID-19. However, since the World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorisation to allow HCQ and Chloroquine (CQ) to be distributed and used for certain hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and numerous clinical trials are underway around the world, including the UK based RECOVERY trial, with over 1000 volunteers. The validation of a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous determination of HCQ and two of its major metabolites, desethylchloroquine (DCQ) and di-desethylchloroquine (DDCQ), in whole blood is described. Methods Blood samples were deproteinised using acetonitrile. HCQ, DCQ and DDCQ were chromatographically separated on a biphenyl column with gradient elution, at a flow rate of 500 µL/min. The analysis time was 8 min. Results For each analyte linear calibration curves were obtained over the concentration range 50-2000 µg/L, the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 13 µg/L, the inter-assay relative standard deviation (RSD) was <10% at 25, 800 and 1750 µg/L and mean recoveries were 80, 81, 78 and 62% for HCQ, d4-HCQ, DCQ and DDCQ, respectively. Conclusion This method has acceptable analytical performance and is applicable to the therapeutic monitoring of HCQ, evaluating the pharmacokinetics of HCQ in COVID-19 patients and supporting clinical trials.","Austin, Donna; John, Catharine; Hunt, Beverley J; Carling, Rachel S",Clin Chem Lab Med,,571

Methods: The efficacy and safety of fibrinolysis were retrospectively analyzed in 7 patients with acute STEM, who hospitalized from February 29, 2020 to April 3, 2020 in the Department of Cardiology, Wuhan Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. To optimize the fibrinolytic process on the premise of prevention and control of COVID-19 transmission, including self-protection of medical staff, a full-time medical team in charge of fibrinolysis under third-grade protection was established. The acute STEMI patients were treated immediately in a fixed and isolated area in emergency department before receiving green channel fibrinolysis. Blood samples for complete blood count, COVID-19 antibody test and nasopharyngeal swab samples for COVID-19 nucleic acid test were made before fibrinolysis, while the chest CT examination was accomplished after fibrinolysis. By comparing differences of time from the first electrocardiogram (ECG) to fibrinolysis before and after the improvement of fibrinolytic process, the effect of optimization of the fibrinolytic process was evaluated. Results: In the present study, seven patients with acute STEMI received fibrinolysis therapy, 6 of them achieved reperfusion and no bleeding was observed in all of the patients. Five out of the 7 patients were hospitalized after fibrinolysis, and the hospitalization days were 19.6 days on average. By following up to April 14, 2020, none of the 7 patients died. The first 2 patients were treated according to the routine medical procedure and the time from the first ECG to fibrinolysis were 201 and 106 minutes, respectively. After the optimization of the fibrinolytic process, the time from the first ECG to fibrinolysis of the last 5 patients were 42, 46, 51, 43 and 54 minutes, respectivelyï¼which was significantly shorter than that before optimization. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 epidemic, fibrinolysis in patients with acute STEMI is safe, effective and easy to implement. Therefore, it is recommended as the top priority for the patients with acute STEMI with indications for fibrinolysis. On the premise of prevention and control of COVID-19 transmission, including self-protection of medical staff, the duration of myocardial ischemia can be shortened by optimization of the fibrinolytic process.","Wei, F; Shuai, X X; Chen, Z J; Cao, G L; Wang, L; Qiu, T; Hu, T; Wu, L; Zhang, Q; Huang, H X; Zhang, Y W; Zhu, L; Cheng, X",Zhonghua Xin Xue Guan Bing Za Zhi,,571

275441,A new imaging sign in COVID-19 pneumonia: vascular changes and their correlation with clinical severity of the disease,2020,"Across group-living animals, linear dominance hierarchies lead to disparities in access to resources, health outcomes and reproductive performance. Studies of how dominance rank predicts these traits typically employ one of several dominance rank metrics without examining the assumptions each metric makes about its underlying competitive processes. Here, we compare the ability of two dominance rank metrics-simple ordinal rank and proportional or 'standardized' rank-to predict 20 traits in a wild baboon population in Amboseli, Kenya. We propose that simple ordinal rank best predicts traits when competition is density-dependent, whereas proportional rank best predicts traits when competition is density-independent. We found that for 75% of traits (15/20), one rank metric performed better than the other. Strikingly, all male traits were best predicted by simple ordinal rank, whereas female traits were evenly split between proportional and simple ordinal rank. Hence, male and female traits are shaped by different competitive processes: males are largely driven by density-dependent resource access (e.g. access to oestrous females), whereas females are shaped by both density-independent (e.g. distributed food resources) and density-dependent resource access. This method of comparing how different rank metrics predict traits can be used to distinguish between different competitive processes operating in animal societies.","Levy, Emily J; Zipple, Matthew N; McLean, Emily; Campos, Fernando A; Dasari, Mauna; Fogel, Arielle S; Franz, Mathias; Gesquiere, Laurence R; Gordon, Jacob B; Grieneisen, Laura; Habig, Bobby; Jansen, David J; Learn, Niki H; Weibel, Chelsea J; Altmann, Jeanne; Alberts, Susan C; Archie, Elizabeth A",Proc Biol Sci,,571

On the positive side, enough is currently known about the epidemic process to permit the construction of mathematical predictive models. We construct and analyze here one first step: that of adapting a traditional SEIR epidemic model to the specific dynamic compartments and epidemic parameters of COVID-19, as it spreads in an age-heterogeneous community. We analyze the current management strategy of the epidemic course (travel bans, service closures and interruptions, social distancing). We generate predictions, and assess the efficiency of these control measures, in the context in which their sustainability is currently being questioned.","Radulescu, Anca; Cavanagh, Kieran",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11150v2.pdf,571

276163,Attitudes on voluntary and mandatory vaccination against COVID-19: Evidence from Germany,2021,"We present a multivariate metabotyping approach to assess the functional recovery of nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients and the possible biochemical sequelae of ""Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome"", colloquially known as long-COVID. Blood samples were taken from patients ca. 3 months after acute COVID-19 infection with further assessment of symptoms at 6 months. Some 57% of the patients had one or more persistent symptoms including respiratory-related symptoms like cough, dyspnea, and rhinorrhea or other nonrespiratory symptoms including chronic fatigue, anosmia, myalgia, or joint pain. Plasma samples were quantitatively analyzed for lipoproteins, glycoproteins, amino acids, biogenic amines, and tryptophan pathway intermediates using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Metabolic data for the follow-up patients (n = 27) were compared with controls (n = 41) and hospitalized severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n = 18, with multiple time-points). Univariate and multivariate statistics revealed variable patterns of functional recovery with many patients exhibiting residual COVID-19 biomarker signatures. Several parameters were persistently perturbed, e.g., elevated taurine (p = 3.6 × 10-3 versus controls) and reduced glutamine/glutamate ratio (p = 6.95 × 10-8 versus controls), indicative of possible liver and muscle damage and a high energy demand linked to more generalized tissue repair or immune function. Some parameters showed near-complete normalization, e.g., the plasma apolipoprotein B100/A1 ratio was similar to that of healthy controls but significantly lower (p = 4.2 × 10-3) than post-acute COVID-19 patients, reflecting partial reversion of the metabolic phenotype (phenoreversion) toward the healthy metabolic state. Plasma neopterin was normalized in all follow-up patients, indicative of a reduction in the adaptive immune activity that has been previously detected in active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other systemic inflammatory biomarkers such as GlycA and the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio remained elevated in some, but not all, patients. Correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and orthogonal-partial least-squares discriminant analysis (O-PLS-DA) showed that the follow-up patients were, as a group, metabolically distinct from controls and partially comapped with the acute-phase patients. Significant systematic metabolic differences between asymptomatic and symptomatic follow-up patients were also observed for multiple metabolites. The overall metabolic variance of the symptomatic patients was significantly greater than that of nonsymptomatic patients for multiple parameters (&#967;2 p = 0.014). Thus, asymptomatic follow-up patients including those with post-acute COVID-19 Syndrome displayed a spectrum of multiple persistent biochemical pathophysiology, suggesting that the metabolic phenotyping approach may be deployed for multisystem functional assessment of individual post-acute COVID-19 patients.","Holmes, Elaine; Wist, Julien; Masuda, Reika; Lodge, Samantha; Nitschke, Philipp; Kimhofer, Torben; Loo, Ruey Leng; Begum, Sofina; Boughton, Berin; Yang, Rongchang; Morillon, Aude-Claire; Chin, Sung-Tong; Hall, Drew; Ryan, Monique; Bong, Sze-How; Gay, Melvin; Edgar, Dale W; Lindon, John C; Richards, Toby; Yeap, Bu B; Pettersson, Sven; Spraul, Manfred; Schaefer, Hartmut; Lawler, Nathan G; Gray, Nicola; Whiley, Luke; Nicholson, Jeremy K",J. proteome res,,571

This could be due to the lack of Consideration of Future Consequences (CFC), a cognitive-motivational construct known to improve health-related behaviors. Therefore, we examined the relationship between CFC and five behaviors-mask-wearing, social distancing, hand hygiene, excessive necessities buying, and COVID-19 information searching using an internet-based Singapore-wide survey conducted from April 20 to May 4, 2020. Behavioral differences 2 weeks before and after the state-wide confinement were examined using paired t-tests. Relationships between CFC and COVID-19 behaviors were examined using regression analyses adjusted for depression and anxiety. Participants were regrouped into three categories-increased behavior performance, maintained high performance, and maintained low performance where mean differences were analysed using MANOVA. Three hundred and thirty-six participants completed the survey (mean age, SD = 32.9 years [SD = 12.6]; 38.7% males). CFCfuture predicted mask wearing (B = 0.16; p < .05), social distancing (B = 0.0.19; p < .01), hand hygiene (B = 0.17; p < .01), and information searching (B = 0.21; p < .001).

276623,Scientific Losses and Gains During the COVID-19 Shutdown,2020,"Importance: Mortality is an important measure of the severity of a pandemic. This study aimed to understand how mortality by age of hospitalized patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 has changed over time. Objective: To evaluate trends in in-hospital mortality among patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study included patients who were hospitalized for at least 1 day at 1 of 209 US acute care hospitals of variable size, in urban and rural areas, between March 1 and November 21, 2020. Eligible patients had a SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antigen test within 7 days of admission or during hospitalization, and a record of discharge or in-hospital death. Exposure: SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test within 7 days before admission or during hospitalization. Mortality was extracted from electronically available data. Results: Among 503â¯409 admitted patients, 42â¯604 (8.5%) had SARS-CoV-2-positive tests. Of those with SARS-CoV-2-positive tests, 21â¯592 (50.7%) were male patients. Hospital admissions among patients with SARS-CoV-2-positive tests were highest in the group aged 65 years or older (19â¯929 [46.8%]), followed by those aged 50 to 64 years (11â¯602 [27.2%]) and 18 to 49 years (10â¯619 [24.9%]). Hospital admissions among patients 18 to 49 years of age increased from 1099 of 5319 (20.7%) in April to 1266 of 4184 (30.3%) in June and 2156 of 7280 (29.6%) in July, briefly exceeding those in the group 50 to 64 years of age (June: 1194 of 4184 [28.5%]; 2039 of 7280 [28.0%]). Patients with SARS-CoV-2-positive tests had higher in-hospital mortality than patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative tests (4705 [11.0%] vs 11â¯707 of 460â¯805 [2.5%]; P < .001). In-hospital mortality rates increased with increasing age for both patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative tests and SARS-CoV-2-positive tests. In patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative tests, mortality increased from 45 of 11â¯255 (0.4%) in those younger than 18 years to 4812 of 107â¯394 (4.5%) in those older than 75 years. In patients with SARS-CoV-2-positive tests, mortality increased from 1 of 454 (0.2%) of those younger than 18 years to 2149 of 10â¯287 (20.9%) in those older than 75 years. In-hospital mortality rates among patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative tests were similar for male and female patients (6273 of 209â¯086 [3.0%] vs 5538 of 251â¯719 [2.2%]) but higher mortality was observed among male patients with SARS-CoV-2-positive tests (2700 of 21â¯592 [12.5%]) compared with female patients with SARS-CoV-2-positive tests (2016 of 21â¯012 [9.60%]). Overall, in-hospital mortality increased from March to April (63 of 597 [10.6%] to 1047 of 5319 [19.7%]), then decreased significantly to November (499 of 5350 [9.3%]; P = .04), with significant decreases in the oldest age groups (50-64 years: 197 of 1542 [12.8%] to 73 of 1341 [5.4%]; P = .02; 65-75 years: 269 of 1182 [22.8%] to 137 of 1332 [10.3%]; P = .006; >75 years: 535 of 1479 [36.2%] to 262 of 1505 [17.4%]; P = .03). Conclusions and Relevance: This nationally representative study supported the findings of smaller, regional studies and found that in-hospital mortality declined across all age groups during the period evaluated. Reductions were unlikely because of a higher proportion of younger patients with lower in-hospital mortality in the later period.","Finelli, Lyn; Gupta, Vikas; Petigara, Tanaz; Yu, Kalvin; Bauer, Karri A; Puzniak, Laura A",JAMA Netw Open,,571

The illness of healthcare workers poses a risk to patients admitted to the hospital, colleagues and households besides their own health. In this study, it was aimed to determine the risk assessment and the factors associated with risk status of an university hospital healthcare workers after risky COVID-19 contact. The data of the descriptive study were obtained from 773 follow-up records of 555 healthcare workers who applied with COVID-19 risky contact between 06.04-10.05.2020. Employees who were positive for RT-PCR evaluated as ""patients"" and others as ""risky contact"". Risk assessment was classified as no risk, low, medium and high risk contact according to the ""Algorithm of Assessment of Health Workers with COVID-19 Contact"" of the Ministry of Health. The relationship between the risk levels of the participants and their demographic and workplace characteristics and their usage of personal protection were evaluated. Mean, standard deviation, percentage, chi-square and ANOVA tests were used in the analysis of the data. The average age of the healthcare workers was determined as 34.4 ± 7.6 years. It was determined that 56.2% of those who had contact were female, 62.9% were married and 17.5% had an additional disease. It was determined that 45.6% of the risky contacts were nurses, 18.4% were supportive personnel and 16.9% were doctors. While 46.5% of the contacts were found as medium, 28.0% low, 17.1% high risk and 8.4% risk free. 38.2% of risky contacts occurred while working in internal/surgical clinics. While 66.0% of the employees had risky contact during patient care and treatment, 25% had risky contact with colleagues in social settings. High-risk contact was higher in social relations between employees. The source of the contact was a colleague in 73.2% of the employees. The average age of high-risk employees was smaller than those of low-risk. While 54.5% of the employees wore surgical masks during contact, 67.8% of the patients did not have a mask. Of 555 employees followed, 37 (6.7%) were diagnosed as COVID-19; 48.6% of the patients were nurses and 18.9% were doctors. It was determined that 48.6% of the healthcare workers were working in the COVID-19 service, outpatient clinic or intensive care unit at the time of diagnosis. The source of the infection was thought to be a colleague in 51.6% of the patients. COVID-19 was more common in nurses and doctors. It was determined that risky contact also occurred in services other than the units where COVID-19 patients were treated and risky contact often took place while providing healthcare to the patients and during social relations between the employees. Unprotected contact of the employees with each other in the workplace was identified as an important risk source. Inadequate use of personal protective equipment by healthcare workers led to an increase in medium and high risk contacts. The use of masks by patients and their relatives during the health service delivery and the proper use of personal protective equipment by healthcare professionals will reduce the risk. With the physical improvement of the rest areas of the employees and the arrangement of the breaks, the risky contact between colleagues in the social areas will be reduced.","Yapici, Gülçin; Kurt, Ahmet Öner; Solmaz, Elif Tugçe; Yeniocak Tunç, Aylin; Bozdag, Fatma; Bugdayci Yalçin, Bengü Nehir; Kaplan, Ekin; Uguz, Burcu Ecem; Dülger, Eray; Özkayalar, Hülya; Aslan, Gönül; Ersöz, Gülden",Mikrobiyol Bul,,571

Exposures: Within the collaborative, multidisciplinary teams implemented multiple strategies supported by mentorship, shared learning, and rapid-cycle data feedback. Partnerships among nonprofit organizations, state governmental agencies, purchasers, and health plans addressed the external environment through transparency, award programs, and incentives. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the change in cesarean delivery rates for NTSV births in California and a difference-in-differences analysis was performed to compare cesarean delivery rates for NTSV births in California vs the rates in the rest of the US. A mixed multivariable logistic regression model that adjusted for patient-level and hospital-level confounders also was used to assess the collaborative and the external statewide actions. The cesarean delivery rates for NTSV births at hospitals participating in the collaborative were compared with the rates from the nonparticipating hospitals and the rates in the participating hospitals prior to participation in the collaborative. Results: A total of 7â¯574â¯889 NTSV births occurred in the US from 2014 to 2019, of which 914â¯283 were at 238 hospitals in California. All California hospitals were exposed to the statewide actions to reduce the rates of cesarean delivery, including the 149 hospitals that had baseline rates of cesarean delivery greater than 23.9% for NTSV births, of which 91 (61%) participated in the quality improvement collaborative. The rate of cesarean delivery for NTSV births in California decreased from 26.0% (95% CI, 25.8%-26.2%) in 2014 to 22.8% (95% CI, 22.6%-23.1%) in 2019 (relative risk, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.87-0.89). The rate of cesarean delivery for NTSV births in the US (excluding California births) was 26.0% in both 2014 and 2019 (relative risk, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.996-1.005). The difference-in-differences analysis revealed that the reduction in the rate of cesarean delivery for NTSV births in California was 3.2% (95% CI, 1.7%-3.5%) higher than in the US (excluding California). Compared with the hospitals and the periods not exposed to the collaborative activities, and after adjusting for patient characteristics and time using a modified stepped-wedge analysis, exposure to collaborative activities was associated with a lower odds of cesarean delivery for NTSV births (24.4% vs 24.6%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.85-0.89]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this observational study of NTSV births in California from 2014 to 2019, the rates of cesarean delivery decreased over time in the setting of the implementation of a coordinated hospital-level collaborative and statewide initiatives designed to support vaginal birth.","Rosenstein, Melissa G; Chang, Shen-Chih; Sakowski, Christa; Markow, Cathie; Teleki, Stephanie; Lang, Lance; Logan, Julia; Cape, Valerie; Main, Elliott K",JAMA,,571

278478,A mathematical model for the coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak,2020-04-02,"BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) may cause severe congenital disease after maternal-fetal transmission. No vaccine is currently available. OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and immunogenicity of Ad26.ZIKV.001, a prophylactic ZIKV vaccine candidate. DESIGN: Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03356561). SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: 100 healthy adult volunteers. INTERVENTION: Ad26.ZIKV.001, an adenovirus serotype 26 vector encoding ZIKV M-Env, administered in 1- or 2-dose regimens of 5 × 1010 or 1 × 1011 viral particles (vp), or placebo. MEASUREMENTS: Local and systemic adverse events; neutralization titers by microneutralization assay (MN50) and T-cell responses by interferon-Î³ enzyme-linked immunospot and intracellular cytokine staining; and protectivity of vaccine-induced antibodies in a subset of participants through transfer in an exploratory mouse ZIKV challenge model. RESULTS: All regimens were well tolerated, with no safety concerns identified. In both 2-dose regimens, ZIKV neutralizing titers peaked 14 days after the second vaccination, with geometric mean MN50 titers (GMTs) of 1065.6 (95% CI, 494.9 to 2294.5) for 5 × 1010 vp and 956.6 (595.8 to 1535.8) for 1 × 1011 vp. Titers persisted for at least 1 year at a GMT of 68.7 (CI, 26.4-178.9) for 5 × 1010 vp and 87.0 (CI, 29.3 to 258.6) for 1 × 1011 vp. A 1-dose regimen of 1 × 1011 vp Ad26.ZIKV.001 induced seroconversion in all participants 56 days after the first vaccination (GMT, 103.4 [CI, 52.7 to 202.9]), with titers persisting for at least 1 year (GMT, 90.2 [CI, 38.4 to 212.2]). Env-specific cellular responses were induced. Protection against ZIKV challenge was observed after antibody transfer from participants into mice, and MN50 titers correlated with protection in this model. LIMITATION: The study was conducted in a nonendemic area, so it did not assess safety and immunogenicity in a flavivirus-exposed population. CONCLUSION: The safety and immunogenicity profile makes Ad26.ZIKV.001 a promising candidate for further development if the need reemerges.

278824,Covid-19 and decarceration,2020,"At present, SARS-CoV-2 has not been shown to be transmitted through food, even so the COVID-19 pandemic has changed how consumers view food and food safety. This study assessed consumer food safety practices during the COVID-19 pandemic using (1) surveys and (2) online focus group discussions. From April to August 2020, five waves of surveys were distributed to an online U.S. consumer panel and screened to include only primary food preparers and grocery shoppers. The online focus groups were conducted via WebEx from May to July 2020. Focus group participants were recruited from the first wave of survey respondents. Both survey respondents and focus group participants reported higher levels of handwashing in response to the pandemic. However, survey participants' anticipated levels of handwashing after the pandemic decreased; some focus group participants noted that human nature ""kicking in"" could lead to lower levels of hand hygiene practice. For each of the five months, the survey reported increased produce washing, both with water only and with water plus soap. Most focus group participants mentioned using water to wash their produce, but some reported using soap and even vinegar to ""kill"" the virus. Since consumers were worried that SARS-Cov-2 could survive on food, they started to mishandle food to address these concerns. However, this study also reported an increase in food thermometer use during the pandemic. Social determinants like gender, income, education, and age may have also influenced changes in levels of practice throughout the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic drove consumers to practice proper and improper food safety practices, which may or may not continue after the pandemic. This study's findings provide timely information to guide future food safety education and communication during health crises and pandemics.","Thomas, Merlyn S; Feng, Yaohua",J. foof prot,,571

This pandemic constrained governments everywhere in the world to force lock-downs to avoid the transmission of infection. Reports show that wearing masks at work diminishes the danger of infection. We assemble our model by utilizing the concept of deep neural learning and AI. The dataset comprises pictures with masked faces and non-masked faces. Several computer algorithms are there for face detection. But this analysis centers around two of the most widely recognized procedures: The Viola-Jones algorithm and the Convolution Neural Networks. We will check whether the individual in the image/video wears a mask or not with a CV and Deep neural learning. Not only finding out about face mask detection, but this project also introduced the chance to delve into the field of computer algorithms.","SivaKumar, M.; Saranprasath, N.; Sridharan, N.

278933,Spatio-temporal dataset of COVID-19 outbreak in Mexico,2021,"More than 2 million people have died as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a counter-regulatory enzyme that converts angiotensin-2 to Ang-(1-7) form in the renin-angiotensin system. Several studies have been analyzed the correlation between ACE2 and COVID-19. Indeed, ACE2/Ang (1-7) system protects the lung against acute respiratory distress syndrome by its anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidant function. However, SARS-Cov-2 can use ACE2 for host cell entry. Expression of ACE2 can be altered by several factors, including hypertension, diabetes and obesity, which also could increase the severity of COVID-19 infection. Besides, since androgens increase the expression of ACE-2, males are at higher risks of COVID-19 infection. Although reported statistics showed a significantly different infection risks of COVID-19 between adults and children, the reason behind the different responses is still unclear. This review proposes the effect of ACE polymorphism on the severity of SARS-COV-2 induced pneumonia. The previous meta-analysis regarding the effect of ACE polymorphism on the severity of pneumonia showed that polymorphism only affects the adult's illness severity and not the children. Two recent meta-analyses examined the effect of ACE polymorphism on the prevalence and mortality rate of COVID-19 and reported contradicting results. Our opinion paper suggests that the effect of ACE polymorphism on the severity of COVID-19 depends on the patients age, same as of the pneumonia.","Mohaghegh, Sadra; Motie, Parisa; Motamedian, Saeed Reza",Clin. chem. lab. med,,571
278946,Super-spreading events initiated the exponential growth phase of COVID-19 with ℛ(0) higher than initially estimated,2020,"Telemedicine involves delivering healthcare and preventative care services to patients without the need for in-person encounters. Traditionally, telemedicine has been used for acute events (e.g., stroke, used to relay essential information to the emergency department) and chronic disease management (e.g., diabetes and chronic kidney disease management). Though the utilization of telemedicine in gastroenterology and hepatology has been modest at best, especially for inflammatory bowel diseases and chronic liver disease management, since the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, utilization of telemedicine in gastroenterology increased by 4000% in the first two weeks, equivalent to the last six years of growth before the pandemic. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) relaxed rules for the use of telemedicine with easing restrictions on reimbursements, location, licensing requirements (across state lines), and the need for a prior provider-patient relationship. These changes increased the use of telemedicine in inpatient and outpatient settings for gastroenterology-related referrals. The use of inpatient telephonic or video consults helps provide timely care during the pandemic while conserving personal protective equipment and decreasing provider and patient exposure. Nevertheless, telehealth use comes at the cost of no direct patient contact and lesser reimbursements. The appropriate use of technology and equipment, training of healthcare providers, use of platforms that can be integrated into the electronic health record while protecting the privacy and the flow of information are essential components of telemedicine. Furthermore, encouraging patients to seek medical care remotely with the proper equipment and improving digital literacy without the need for physical examinations is a challenge, further compounded in elderly or hard-of-hearing patients and in patients who are more comfortable with in-person visits. The authors will systematically review and discuss how telemedicine can be integrated into the practice of gastroenterology and hepatology, with emphasis placed on discussing barriers to success and the ways they can be mitigated.","Perisetti, Abhilash; Goyal, Hemant",Dig Dis Sci,,571

279569,Emerging Pathways Towards a Post-COVID-19 Reset and Recovery,2020,"Suicide continues to be a global health concern, affecting all continents. Although some studies have associated it with mental disorders such as severe depression, research also shows that a significant number of cases occur due to emerging life stresses. It is one of the leading causes of death among young people and is steady on the rise in Malawi. Malawi's suicide cases disproportionately affect young males from rural areas. These cases are also higher than those of neighbouring countries. During the lockdown period to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic between April and September 2020, Malawi saw a rise in suicide cases, most of which were due to the resulting financial hardship. There is need to tackle the suicide epidemic holistically, on all tiers of intervention. People need to be equipped with socially acceptable coping mechanisms which are easily adaptable to a low resource setting. There is a need for initiative to be taken in training individuals who can manage mental ill health without overwhelming the health system. The entire health system and health policies should acknowledge the importance of mental ill-health and its consequences. Malawi needs to prioritise mental health issues, realising that indeed, there is no health, without mental health.","Banda, Gift Treighcy; Banda, Natasha; Chadza, Anthony; Mthunzi, Chisomo",Pan Afr Med J,,571

The findings highlight the emerging themes around the meaning of ‘home’ for three different generations of Māori living in different geographical locations and how these meanings shape or influence the perception of how to ‘be well at home’. By investigating the views and attitudes of Māori community members in two distinct communities regarding what ‘home’ means to them, the research has been able to identify that ‘home’ is more than a spatial or physical notion, and that there are a range of holistically connected aspects that need to be considered if we are to deliver effective and sustainable solutions around Māori being ‘at home’. As Māori meanings of ‘home’ are adapting, developing and changing, especially in the current Coronavirus Covid-19 context, the findings from this research contribute to the significant thinking that needs to influence future policy direction and also highlights areas that require further investigation. © 2021 The Author(s).

281248,Ten Facts about UV Radiation and COVID-19,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes a spectrum of disease; some patients develop a severe proinflammatory state which can be associated with a unique coagulopathy and procoagulant endothelial phenotype. Initially, COVID-19 infection produces a prominent elevation of fibrinogen and D-dimer/fibrin(ogen) degradation products. This is associated with systemic hypercoagulability and frequent venous thromboembolic events. The degree of D-dimer elevation positively correlates with mortality in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 also leads to arterial thrombotic events (including strokes and ischemic limbs) as well as microvascular thrombotic disorders (as frequently documented at autopsy in the pulmonary vascular beds). COVID-19 patients often have mild thrombocytopenia and appear to have increased platelet consumption, together with a corresponding increase in platelet production. Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) and severe bleeding events are uncommon in COVID-19 patients. Here, we review the current state of knowledge of COVID-19 and hemostasis.","Wool, Geoffrey D; Miller, Jonathan L",Pathobiology,,571
281347,Lessons Learned: Active Engagement in a Large-Enrollment Introductory Biochemistry Course During a Remote Quarter,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a single stranded RNA virus and responsible for infecting human being. In many cases the individual may remain asymptomatic. Some recently reported studies revealed that individuals of elderly age group and with pre-existing medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus had severe consequences, even may lead to death. However, it is not clearly delineated whether hypertension itself or associated comorbidities or antihypertensive therapy contributes to the grave prognosis of COVID-19 infections. This review is aimed to decipher the exact mechanisms involved at molecular level from existing evidence and as reported. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 enters into the host cell through interaction between conserved residues of viral spike protein and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor which is highly expressed in host's cardiac and pulmonary cells and finally transmembrane protease, serine-2 (TMPRSS2), helps in priming of the surface protein. Subsequently, symptom related to multi organ involvement is primarily contributed by cytokine storm. Although various clinical trials are being conducted on renin- angiotensin- system inhibitor, till to date there is no standard treatment protocol approved for critically ill COVID-19 positive cases with pre-existing hypertension. Recently, several studies are carried out to document the safety and efficacy outcome of mesenchymal stem cell transplantation based on its immunomodulatory and regenerative properties. Therefore, identification of future novel therapeutics in the form of mesenchymal stem cell either alone or in combination with pharmacological approach could be recommended for combating SARS-CoV-2 which might be dreadful to debilitating elderly people.

281553,COVID-19 and market risk: An assessment of the G-20 nations,2020,"Respiratory viral infection can cause severe disease and hospitalization, especially among children, the elderly, and patients with comorbidities. In Brazil, the official surveillance system of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) investigates influenza A (IAV) and B (IBV) viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (HAdV), and parainfluenza viruses (hPIV 1-3). In Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil, many fatalities associated with SARI between 2013 and 2017 occurred among patients without underlying diseases and for whom the causative agent had not been identified using official protocols. This cross-sectional study analyzed the presence of coronaviruses (HCoV), bocavirus (HBoV), metapneumovirus (hMPV), and rhinovirus in patients who died of SARI despite not having comorbidities, and that were negative for IAV, IBV, RSV, HAdV, and hPIV. Nasopharyngeal aspirates/swabs from patients were used for nucleic acid extraction. The presence of HCoVs OC43, HKU1, NL63, and 229E; HBoV; hMPV; and rhinovirus was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Clinical data were also analyzed. Between 2013 and 2017, 16 225 cases of SARI were reported in RS; 9.8% of the patients died; 20% of all fatal cases were patients without comorbidities and for whom no pathogen was detected using standard protocols. Analysis of 271 of these cases identified HCoV in nine cases; HBoV, hMPV, and rhinovirus were detected in 3, 3, and 10 cases, respectively. Of note, patients infected with HCoV were adults. Results reinforce the importance of including coronaviruses in diagnostic panels used by official surveillance systems because besides their pandemic potential, endemic HCoVs are associated to severe disease in healthy adults.","Veiga, Ana B Gorini da; Martins, Letícia G; Riediger, Irina; Mazetto, Alix; Debur, Maria do Carmo; Gregianini, Tatiana S",J. med. virol,,571

Clear understanding of the nature of the diagnostic tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and their challenges, collecting the most diagnostically valuable specimen at the right time from the right anatomic site, and interpretation of their findings is important. This review scrutinizes current challenges and interpretation of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), as the reference method, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), antibody and antigen detection, typical lung imaging characteristics and prominent abnormal changes in laboratory findings of patients with proven COVID-19, and describes how the results may vary over time. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and sputum specimens demonstrate the highest positive rates (93% and 72%, respectively) in molecular diagnosis of COVID-19. Alternatively, repeated RT-PCR assays can be performed;as over time, it is an increase in the likelihood of the SARS-CoV-2 being present in the nasopharynx. Combining clinical evidence with results of chest computed tomography (CT) and RT-PCR can minimize the risk of diagnostic errors. Elevated levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and D-dimer are thought to be closely associated with the occurrence of severe COVID-19 in adults, and their combined detection can serve as early factors predicting the severity of COVID-19. Moreover, elevated acute phase proteins are associated with a poor outcome in COVID-19. Serological diagnosis also is an important tool to understand the extent of COVID-19 in the community, and to identify individuals, who are immune. Antibodies begin to increase from the second week of symptom onset.","Ahmadikia, K.; Mahmoudi, S.; Hassanali, F.; Keshavarz, M.; Mirhendi, H.",Journal of Isfahan Medical School,,571

This was particularly evident in the face of the COVID-19 epidemic. Relatedly, it is practical and desirable for people to wear masks for health, fashion, and religious regions. However, depending on cultural differences, people naturally accept wearing a mask, or they look upon it negatively. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread mask-wearing mandates worldwide. In the case of COVID-19, wearing a mask is strongly recommended, so by analyzing the news data before and after the spread of the epidemic, it is possible to see how the direction of crisis management is being structured. In particular, by utilizing big data analysis of international news data, discourses around the world can be analyzed more deeply. This study collected and analyzed 58,061 international news items related to mask-wearing from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2020. The collected dataset was compared before and after the World Health Organization's pandemic declaration by applying structural topic model analysis. The results revealed that prior to the declaration, issues related to the COVID-19 outbreak were emphasized, but afterward, issues related to movement restrictions, quarantine management, and local economic impacts emerged.","Lee, Kyeo Re; Kim, Byungjun; Nan, Dongyan; Kim, Jang Hyun",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,571

282750,The Efficacy of Plant-Based Ionizers in Removing Aerosol for COVID-19 Mitigation,2021,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae, causes acute diarrhea and/or vomiting, dehydration and high mortality in neonatal piglets. Two different genogroups of PEDV, S INDEL [PEDV variant containing multiple deletions and insertions in the S1 subunit of the spike (S) protein, G1b] and non-S INDEL (G2b) strains were detected during the diarrheal disease outbreak in US swine in 2013-2014. Similar viruses are also circulating globally. Continuous improvement and update of biosecurity and vaccine strains and protocols are still needed to control and prevent PEDV infections worldwide. Although the non-S INDEL PEDV was highly virulent and the S INDEL PEDV caused milder disease, the latter has the capacity to cause illness in a high number of piglets on farms with low biosecurity and herd immunity. The main PEDV transmission route is fecal-oral, but airborne transmission via the fecal-nasal route may play a role in pig-to-pig and farm-to-farm spread. PEDV infection of neonatal pigs causes fecal virus shedding (alongside frequent detection of PEDV RNA in the nasal cavity), acute viremia, severe atrophic enteritis (mainly jejunum and ileum), and increased pro-inflammatory and innate immune responses. PEDV-specific IgA effector and memory B cells in orally primed sows play a critical role in sow lactogenic immunity and passive protection of piglets. This review focuses on the etiology, transmission, pathogenesis, and prevention and control of PEDV infection.","Jung, Kwonil; Saif, Linda J; Wang, Qiuhong",Virus Res,,571

Hence, to try out new treatments for the disease, the first attempts have been made based on the SBDR methods which seem to be among the proper choices for discovering the potential medications against the emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Given the importance of SBDR approaches, in the present review, well-known SBDR methods are summarized, and their merits are investigated. Then, the databases and software applications, utilized for repurposing the drugs against COVID-19, are introduced. Besides, the identified drugs are categorized based on their targets. Finally, a comparison is made between the SBDR approaches and other DR methods, and some possible future directions are proposed.","Masoudi-Sobhanzadeh, Yosef; Salemi, Aysan; Pourseif, Mohammad M; Jafari, Behzad; Omidi, Yadollah; Masoudi-Nejad, Ali",Brief. bioinform,,571

The COVID-19 pandemic can be thought of as a syndemic-where cases cluster ""on a background of social and economic disparity"". In this brief report, we describe factors that put Chuukese and Marshallese at increased risk for COVID-19 in Hawaii. We show that Micronesians had increased risk for COVID-19 due to limited employment opportunities, housing insecurity, and underlying comorbid conditions in the context of rescinded federal health insurance and broken government promises. We also highlight the resiliency that many community members demonstrated in preventing new infections and supporting those infected. We conclude that COVID-19 in Hawaii should be understood as a syndemic, where Micronesians were disproportionately affected due to disparities in housing, employment, and health access.

This led to a focus on telephone triage and remote prescribing that potentially impeded urgent referrals for suspected oral cancer. Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust (GSTFT) screens and diagnoses potential head and neck cancer patients via a 2-week wait (2 WW) clinic and provides access to patients with urgent oral health needs through an Acute Dental Care (ADC) service. The current service evaluation aims to assess and report on the impact of COVID-19 and the cessation of primary care dentistry on oral cancer diagnosis at GSTFT during a period of time where patients had extremely limited access to healthcare. Materials and Methods: Data regarding oral cancer diagnoses were collected retrospectively from secure logbooks and clinical records from the point at which routine dental practice was nationally halted (23 March 2020) to the date at which services were permitted to resume (08 June 2020). Individual patient pathways prior to diagnosis and through to treatment were recorded. Results: Sixteen new diagnoses of oral cancer were made during the described timeframe. Findings suggest that the paralysis of routine dental services resulted in delayed referral of suspicious lesions and highlights the limitations of a predominately telephone-based assessment service in primary care. Conclusion: The importance of the role of the primary care practitioner in the early identification of oral cancer has been emphasised.,"Sandhu, Pradeep; Grossman, Sanford; Beneng, Kiran",,,571

Racialization takes place in various dimensions of life, but we will focus here on issues of schooling and education, which were accentuated during the COVID-19 pandemic and revealed a lack of social deprotection and inequalities between Roma and non-Roma students. This analysis, focusing on the impact on young people attending secondary education, is based on a qualitative study carried out in the Metropolitan Areas of Lisbon and Porto using data from three focus groups and in-depth interviews with 33 secondary school students. Several public policies currently cover the Roma/Ciganos, but social inequality persists in terms of basic subsistence conditions and civic participation, as well as in the form of structural racism, with little Roma participation in political life and the invisibility of representation. The situation has worsened exponentially due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the combination of “classic” forms of racism and discrimination and the new forms of exclusion that have also appeared. We argue that the implicit acceptance of poverty and marginalization among Roma people needs to be viewed as a component of the racialization and antigypsyism to which they are subjected, and this dimension needs to be further investigated by scientific agendas.","Magano, Olga Mendes Maria Manuela",Social Sciences,,571

The antiviral effect of hemin, and chloroquine as a control, against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection was quantified by RT-qPCR using specific oligonucleotides for the N gene. Chloroquine induced a marked reduction of viral genome copies in kidney epithelial Vero-E6 cells but not in lung cancer Calu-3 cells. Hemin administration to the culture medium induced a high induction in the expression of the HO-1 gene that was stronger in Vero-E6 macaque-derived cells than in the human Calu-3 cell line. However, hemin treatment did not modify SARS-CoV-2 replication, as measured by viral genome quantification 48 h post-infection for Vero-E6 and 72 h post-infection for the Calu-3 lineages. In conclusion, although exposure to hemin induced strong HO-1 up-regulation, this effect was unable to inhibit or delay the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in two epithelial cell lines susceptible to infection.","Maestro, Sheila; Córdoba, Karol M; Olague, Cristina; Argemi, Josepmaria; Ávila, Matías A; González-Aseguinolaza, Gloria; Smerdou, Cristian; Fontanellas, Antonio",Biomed Pharmacother,,571

Scopus, Cochrane Library, Medrxiv, Google Scholar and PubMED/MEDLINE were searched by four independent investigators for studies investigating ACE2 or TMPRSS2 expressions in head and neck tissues. The following outcomes were considered: sample origin (animal versus human); detection method; anatomical location and cell types. PRISMA checklist and modified population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing and setting (PICOTS) framework were used to perform the review. Of the 24 identified studies, 17 met our inclusion criteria. Thirteen studies were conducted during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were expressed in oral, pharyngeal, sinusonasal human mucosa. The following cell types expressed ACE2: basal, apical, goblet, minor salivary, and endothelial cells. TMPRSS2 was found in goblet and apical respiratory cells. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were found in the olfactory region, especially in sustentacular non-neural and neural stem cells. Animal studies suggested that ACE2 expression may vary regarding age. There was an important heterogeneity between studies in the methods used to detect ACE2 and TMPRSS2, leading to a potential identification bias. The SARS-CoV-2 receptors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, are both expressed in many head and neck tissues, enabling the viral entry into the host organism.","Lechien, Jerome R; Radulesco, Thomas; Calvo-Henriquez, Christian; Chiesa-Estomba, Carlos M; Hans, Stéphane; Barillari, Maria R; Cammaroto, Giovanni; Descamps, Géraldine; Hsieh, Julien; Vaira, Luigi; De Riu, Giacomo; Sowerby, Leigh; Gengler, Isabelle; Michel, Justin; Saussez, Sven",Head Neck pathol,,571

286711,Using Time Wisely During COVID-19,2020,"Background: Underestimation of the number of cases during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a constant concern worldwide. Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA using realtime reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most common method to confirm a case. However, these tests have suboptimal sensitivity. Objective: The objective of the study was to estimate the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths in Mexico, accounting for the probabilities of false-negative tests. Methods: We used publicly available, national databases of all SARS-CoV-2 tests performed at public laboratories in Mexico between February 27 and October 31, 2020. We used the estimated probabilities of false-negative tests based on the day of clinical sample collection after symptom initiation calculated previously. With the resulting model, we estimated the corrected daily number of cases, ICU admissions, and deaths. Results: Among 2,024,822 people tested in Mexico between February 27 and October 31 with an available result, we estimated 1,248,583 (95% confidence interval 1,094,850-1,572,818) cases, compared to 902,343 cases reported with positive tests. ICU admissions and deaths were 15% and 8% higher than reported, respectively. Conclusion: Accounting for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-based diagnostic tests' precision is a simple way to improve estimations for the true number of COVID-19 cases among tested persons.","Núñez, Isaac; Belaunzarán-Zamudio, Pablo F.; Caro-Vega, Yanink",Rev Invest Clin,,571

Such interest has grown with the increasing availability of smart phones and tablets. In this review we examine the literature documenting human social learning and how this learning is impacted when the instructing agent appears on a screen instead of face-to-face. We then explore the shifting nature of screen-based media, with a focus on the increasingly socio-normative manner information is portrayed. We discuss how the changing nature of screen technology might be altering how children interpret what they see, and raise the possibility that this may render prevailing evidence as historical documentation, rather than setting out established developmental milestones that transcend the period in which they were documented. We contend that recognizing the significance of historically changing contexts in developmental psychology is timely when the COVID-19 climate is pushing data collection on-line for many labs, often using tasks that were developed primarily for face-to-face contexts.","Nielsen, Mark; Fong, Frankie T K; Whiten, Andrew",Adv Child Dev Behav,,571

It is divided into seven compartmental classes, namely, susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatically infected (I s ), asymptomatically infected (I a ), quarantined (Q), recovered (R), and death (D), respectively. The next-generation matrix approach was used to compute the basic reproduction number denoted as R cvd19 of the proposed model. The results show that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if R cvd19 < 1. On the other hand, the global asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium occurs if R cvd19 > 1. The mathematical analysis of the model is supported using numerical simulations. Moreover, the model's analysis and numerical results prove that the consistent use of face masks would go on a long way in reducing the COVID-19 pandemic.","Riyapan, Pakwan; Shuaib, Sherif Eneye; Intarasit, Arthit",Comput Math Methods Med,,571

METHODS: In this study, a well-verified real anatomical model was used; the passage of air in the human upper respiratory system computed using high-quality Computer Tomography (CT) images. Then, the airflow field, along with the coronavirus micro-droplets injection, was examined in this realistic model using the Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) method. The Discrete Phase Model (DPM) was used to solve the field, and with the help of it, the accurate assessment of the temporal and spatial motion of the deposition in the virus-impregnated droplets was obtained in vitro in the upper respiratory system. RESULTS: The results show that the amount of deposited micro-droplets in the nasal cavity area is meager at the inhalation only through the oral. However, it has the most residence time in this area. The most and least droplet absorption occurred in the oral cavity and larynx-trachea, respectively. Deposition efficiency is about 100% in 30 L/min flow rate and 10 µm diameter; in other words, no droplet enters the lungs. This study's other achievements include the relatively inverse relationship between droplets deposition efficiency in some parts of the upper airway, which have the most deformation in the tract. CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of a realistic model with accurate and precise computational analysis can end speculation about the deposition zone, accumulation, and the effects of the COVID-19 virus on the upper respiratory tract. On the other hand, recognizing the virus-containing droplet location can ease understanding the areas where the virus can first infect in the upper respiratory tract.","Mortazavi, Hamed; Beni, Hamidreza Mortazavy; Aghaei, Fatemeh; Sajadian, Seyed Hossein",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,571
287764,COVID-19 and urban vulnerability in India,2020,"PURPOSE: Inflammatory pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. Frequent sauna sessions may reduce the risk of respiratory tract infections including pneumonia independent of inflammation. We aimed to evaluate the independent and joint associations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and frequency of sauna bathing (FSB) with risk of pneumonia in a prospective cohort study. METHODS: Serum hsCRP as an inflammatory marker was measured using an immunometric assay and FSB was assessed by self-reported sauna bathing habits at baseline in 2264 men aged 42-61 yr. Serum hsCRP was categorized as normal and high (&#8804;3 and >3 mg/L, respectively) and FSB as low and high (defined as &#8804;1 and 2-7 sessions/wk, respectively). Multivariable-adjusted HRs (CIs) were calculated for incident pneumonia. RESULTS: A total of 528 cases of pneumonia occurred during a median follow-up of 26.6 yr. Comparing high versus normal hsCRP, the multivariable-adjusted risk for pneumonia was HR = 1.30 (95% CI, 1.04-1.62). The corresponding risk was HR = 0.79 (95% CI, 0.66-0.95) comparing high versus low FSB. Compared with men with normal hsCRP and low FSB, high hsCRP and low FSB was associated with an increased risk of pneumonia in multivariable analysis (HR = 1.67: 95% CI, 1.21-2.29), with no evidence of an association for high hsCRP and high FSB and pneumonia (HR = 0.94: 95% CI, 0.69-1.29). CONCLUSIONS: In a general middle-aged to older male Caucasian population, frequent sauna baths attenuated the increased risk of pneumonia due to inflammation.","Kunutsor, Setor K; Jae, Sae Young; Laukkanen, Jari A",J. cardiopulm. rehabil. prev,,571

Here, we deployed algorithms relying on artificial intelligence, network diffusion, and network proximity, tasking each of them to rank 6,340 drugs for their expected efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. To test the predictions, we used as ground truth 918 drugs experimentally screened in VeroE6 cells, as well as the list of drugs in clinical trials that capture the medical community's assessment of drugs with potential COVID-19 efficacy. We find that no single predictive algorithm offers consistently reliable outcomes across all datasets and metrics. This outcome prompted us to develop a multimodal technology that fuses the predictions of all algorithms, finding that a consensus among the different predictive methods consistently exceeds the performance of the best individual pipelines. We screened in human cells the top-ranked drugs, obtaining a 62% success rate, in contrast to the 0.8% hit rate of nonguided screenings. Of the six drugs that reduced viral infection, four could be directly repurposed to treat COVID-19, proposing novel treatments for COVID-19. We also found that 76 of the 77 drugs that successfully reduced viral infection do not bind the proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2, indicating that these network drugs rely on network-based mechanisms that cannot be identified using docking-based strategies. These advances offer a methodological pathway to identify repurposable drugs for future pathogens and neglected diseases underserved by the costs and extended timeline of de novo drug development.","Morselli Gysi, Deisy; do Valle, Ítalo; Zitnik, Marinka; Ameli, Asher; Gan, Xiao; Varol, Onur; Ghiassian, Susan Dina; Patten, J J; Davey, Robert A; Loscalzo, Joseph; Barabási, Albert-László",Proc.

288086,Variation in predicted COVID-19 risk among lemurs and lorises,2021,"The estimation of unknown parameters in simulations, also known as calibration, is crucial for practical management of epidemics and prediction of pandemic risk. A simple yet widely used approach is to estimate the parameters by minimizing the sum of the squared distances between actual observations and simulation outputs. It is shown in this paper that this method is inefficient, particularly when the epidemic models are developed based on certain simplifications of reality, also known as imperfect models which are commonly used in practice. To address this issue, a new estimator is introduced that is asymptotically consistent, has a smaller estimation variance than the least squares estimator, and achieves the semiparametric efficiency. Numerical studies are performed to examine the finite sample performance. The proposed method is applied to the analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic for 20 countries based on the SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model with both deterministic and stochastic simulations. The estimation of the parameters, including the basic reproduction number and the average incubation period, reveal the risk of disease outbreaks in each country and provide insights to the design of public health interventions.","Sung, Chih-Li; Hung, Ying",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.12523v1.pdf,571

Studies comparing the two agents have not been performed. METHODS: Consecutive patients from a prospective registry who underwent RFA of AF between April 2012 and March 2015 and were on apixaban or rivaroxaban were studied. Clinical variables and outcomes were noted. RESULTS: There were a total of 358 patients (n = 56 on apixaban and n = 302 on rivaroxaban). There were no differences in baseline characteristics between both groups. The last dose of rivaroxaban was administered the night before the procedure in 96% of patients. In patients on apixaban, 48% of patients whose procedure was in the afternoon took the medication on the morning of the procedure. TIA/CVA occurred in 2 patients (0.6%) in rivaroxaban group with none in apixaban group (p = 0.4). There was no difference in the rate of pericardial effusion between apixaban and rivaroxaban groups [1.7% vs 0.6% (p = 0.4)]. Five percent of patients in both groups had groin complications (p = 0.9). In apixaban group, all groin complications were small hematomas except one patient who had a pseudoaneurysm (1.6%). One pseudo-aneurysm, 1 fistula and 3 large hematomas were noted in patients on rivaroxaban (1.7%) with the rest being small hematomas.

288874,COVID-19 Development Innovation Agenda: An Economic and Financial Lens,2020,"BACKGROUND: Background: University students are experiencing higher levels of distress and mental health disorders. In addressing mental health needs, web-based interventions have shown increasing promise to overcome geographic distances and high student-to-counselor ratios, leading to the potential for wider implementation. The Mindfulness Virtual Community (MVC) program, a web based program, guided by mindfulness and cognitive behavioural therapy principles, is among efforts aimed at effectively and efficiently reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress in students. OBJECTIVE: Objective: This study's aim was to evaluate the efficacy of an 8-week MVC program in reducing depression, anxiety, and perceived stress (primary outcomes), and improving mindfulness (secondary outcome) in undergraduate students at a large Canadian university. Guided by two prior randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that each demonstrated efficacy when conducted during regular university operations, the current study coincided with a university-wide labour strike. Nonetheless, the students' response to an online mental health program on a disrupted campus can provide useful information for anticipating the impact of other disruptions, including those related to COVID-19, currently and in a foreseeable future. METHODS: Methods: In this parallel arm randomized controlled trial (RCT), 154 students were randomly allocated to an 8-week MVC intervention (n= 76) or a waitlist control (WLC) condition (n= 78). The MVC intervention included (1) educational and mindfulness video modules, (2) anonymous peer-peer discussions, and (3) anonymous, group-based, professionally-guided, 20-min videoconferences. Study outcomes were evaluated at baseline and at 8-week follow-up using: Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire Short Form (FFMQ-SF). Generalized estimation equations with an AR(1) covariance structure were used to evaluate the impact of intervention, with outcome evaluations performed on both an intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) basis. RESULTS: Results: Participants (n= 154) included 35 males and 117 females with a mean age of 23.1 years. There were no statistically significant differences at baseline between MVC and WLC on demographics and psychological characteristics, indicating similar demographic and psychological characteristics across the MVC-WLC groups. Results under both ITT and PP approaches indicated that except for PSS (ITT: ß= -2.31, P= .03; PP: ß= -2.38, P= .03), there were no statistically significant between group differences in PHQ-9 (ITT: ß= -0.44, P= 0.64; PP: ß= -0.62, P= .053), BAI (ITT: ß= -2.06, P= .31; PP: ß= -2.32, P= .27), and FFMQ-SF (ITT: ß= 1.33, P= .43; PP: ß= 1.44, P= .41) compared to WLC. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions: During a university labour strike, the MVC program led to statistically significant reductions in PSS compared to WLC, but no other significant between group differences.

Certainly, for people who act against the law this is a typical opportunity, a situation that can be used to generate spectacular profits. On the other hand, for law-enforcing organizations the state of epidemic threat is, if not a crisis, certainly an emergency situation.

This paper presents a single-institution case series of hospitalized myasthenia gravis patients with COVID 19. We identified eight patients previously diagnosed with myasthenia gravis, four of whom presented with clear signs of myasthenia gravis symptom worsening on admission. No form of respiratory support was needed during the complete duration of stay for three patients, oxygen therapy was administered to two patients, while the remaining three patients required mechanical ventilation. Treatment was successful for seven patients, six of whom were discharged without any myasthenia gravis symptoms. One patient died after eleven days of intensive care unit treatment. Although treatment of patients with myasthenia gravis and COVID-19 patients is challenging, case series of myasthenia gravis patients with COVID-19 treated in our institution demonstrates relatively favorable treatment outcome. Our data seem to support the notion that immunosuppressive medication does not seem to result in worse outcomes. Our data also support the notion that intravenous immunoglobulin treatment is safe and should be administered to patients with myasthenia gravis and COVID-19 in case of myasthenia gravis worsening since benefits seem to greatly outweigh the risks.","Zupanic, Sven; Peric Situm, Martina; Majdak, Maja; Karakas, Mirna; Basic, Silvio; Sporis, Davor",Acta neurol.

The mRNA technology is an unprecedented vaccine, usually given in two doses to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections. Despite effectiveness and safety, inter-individual immune response heterogeneity has been observed in recipients of mRNA-based vaccines. As a novel disease, the specific immune response mechanism responsible for warding off COVID-19 remains unclear at this point. However, significant evidence suggests that humoral response plays a crucial role in affording immunoprotection and preventing debilitating sequelae from COVID-19. As such this paper focused on the possible effects of age, sex, serostatus, and comorbidities on humoral response (i.e., total antibodies, IgG and/or IgA) of different populations post-mRNA-based Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination. A systematic search of literature was performed through PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar. Studies were included if they reported humoral response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. A total of 32 studies was identified and reviewed, and the percent difference of means of reported antibody levels were calculated for comparison. Findings revealed that older individuals, the male sex, seronegativity, and those with more comorbidities mounted less humoral immune response. Given these findings, several recommendations were proposed regarding the current vaccination practices. These include giving additional doses of vaccination for immunocompromised and elderly populations. Another recommendation is conducting clinical trials in giving a combined scheme of mRNA vaccines, protein vaccines, and vector-based vaccines.","Notarte, Kin Israel; Ver, Abbygail Therese; Velasco, Jacqueline Veronica; Pastrana, Adriel; Catahay, Jesus Alfonso; Salvagno, Gian Luca; Yap, Eric Peng Huat; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis; Torrelles, Jordi; Lippi, Giuseppe; Henry, Brandon Michael",,,571

People with severe mental illness face profound health inequalities (e.g. a &gt;20-year mortality gap). Digital exclusion puts this population at risk of heightened or compounded inequalities. This has been referred to as the 'digital divide'. For any new digital means introduced in clinical practice to augment healthcare service provision, issues of accessibility, acceptability and usability should be addressed by researchers and developers early in the design phase, and prior to full implementation, to prevent digital exclusion.

291155,Covid-19: Trump returns to White House amid confusion over his illness and treatment,2020,"Elevations in troponin levels have been shown to predict mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The role of inflammation in myocardial injury remains unclear. We sought to determine the association of elevated troponin with mortality in a large, ethnically diverse population of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and to determine the association of elevated inflammatory markers with increased troponin levels. We reviewed all patients admitted at our health system with COVID-19 from March 1 to April 27, 2020, who had a troponin assessment within 48 hours of admission. We used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for mortality during hospitalization, controlling for demographics, co-morbidities, and markers of inflammation. Of 11,159 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 6,247 had a troponin assessment within 48 hours. Of these, 4,426 (71%) patients had normal, 919 (15%) had mildly elevated, and 902 (14%) had severely elevated troponin. Acute phase and inflammatory markers were significantly elevated in patients with mildly and severely elevated troponin compared with normal troponin. Patients with elevated troponin had significantly increased odds of death for mildly elevated compared with normal troponin (adjusted OR, 2.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.68 to 2.53; p < 0.001) and for severely elevated compared with normal troponin (OR, 4.51; 95% confidence interval, 3.66 to 5.54; p < 0.001) independently of elevation in inflammatory markers. In conclusion, patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and elevated troponin had markedly increased mortality compared with patients with normal troponin levels. This risk was independent of cardiovascular co-morbidities and elevated markers of inflammation.","Majure, David T; Gruberg, Luis; Saba, Shahryar G; Kvasnovsky, Charlotte; Hirsch, Jamie S; Jauhar, Rajiv",Am J Cardiol,,571

Cases of persons reinfected with the virus are being reported with increasing frequency. At present it is unclear how common reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is and how long serum antibodies and virus-specific T cells persist after infection. For many other respiratory virus infections, including influenza and the seasonal coronaviruses that cause colds, serum antibodies persist for only months to a few years and reinfections are very common. Here we review what is known about the duration of immunity and reinfection with coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and well as the duration of immunity to other viruses and virus vaccines. These findings have implications for the need of continued protective measures and for vaccines for persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Cohen, Jeffrey I; Burbelo, Peter D",Clin. infect. dis,,571

Yet information regarding the degree to which masks affect acoustics and perception associated with voice performers is scarce. This study examines these effects with common face masks, namely a neck gaiter, disposable surgical mask, and N95 mask, as well as a novel material that could be used as a mask (acoustic foam). A recorded excerpt from the ""Star-Spangled Banner"" was played through a miniature speaker placed inside the mouth of a masked manikin. Experienced listeners were asked to rate perceptual qualities of these singing stimuli by blindly comparing them with the same recording captured without a mask. Acoustic analysis showed that face masks affected the sound by enhancing or suppressing different frequency bands compared to no mask. Acoustic energy around the singer's formant was reduced when using surgical and N95 masks, which matches observations that these masks are more detrimental to the perceptions of singing voice compared with neck gaiter or acoustic foam. It suggests that singers can benefit from masks designed for minimal impact on auditory perception of the singing voice while maintaining reasonable efficacy of filtering efficiency.","Oren, Liran; Rollins, Michael; Gutmark, Ephraim; Howell, Rebecca",J. voice,,571

This study aimed to disclose the association between statins and 60-day COVID-19 mortality. Approach and Results: All patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study from January 19 to April 16, 2020, in Korea. We evaluated the association between the use of statins and COVID-19-related mortality in the overall and the nested 1:2 propensity score-matched study. Furthermore, a comparison of the hazard ratio for death was performed between COVID-19 patients and a retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized with pneumonia between January and June 2019 in Korea. The median age of the 10 448 COVID-19 patients was 45 years. Statins were prescribed in 533 (5.1%) patients. After adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, Cox regression showed a significant decrease in hazard ratio associated with the use of statins (hazard ratio, 0.637 [95% CI, 0.425-0.953]; P=0.0283). Moreover, on comparing the hazard ratio between COVID-19 patients and the retrospective cohort of hospitalized pneumonia patients, the use of statins showed similar benefits. CONCLUSIONS: The use of statins correlates significantly with lower mortality in patients with COVID-19, consistent with the findings in patients with pneumonia.

Motivated by the complex neural networks, in this paper we introduce complex representation into the BNNs and propose Binary complex neural network -- a novel network design that processes binary complex inputs and weights through complex convolution, but still can harvest the extraordinary computation efficiency of BNNs. To ensure fast convergence rate, we propose novel BCNN based batch normalization function and weight initialization function. Experimental results on Cifar10 and ImageNet using state-of-the-art network models (e.g., ResNet, ResNetE and NIN) show that BCNN can achieve better accuracy compared to the original BNN models. BCNN improves BNN by strengthening its learning capability through complex representation and extending its applicability to complex-valued input data.

Edible polymer coatings for GCBs can help preserve flavors and improve shelf life of GCBs. This study aimed to incorporate &#945;-tocopherol, a powerful antioxidant, in thermoplastic starch [TPS] and chitosan [TPC] and determined the best cavitation energy (960-3840â¯J·mL-1) using an ultrasonic probe. Then, we evaluated the incorporation of bentonite (0% and 2% m/m) and &#945;-tocopherol (0% and 10% m/m) in the best energy cavitation/biopolymer combination. The TPS and TPC coatings demonstrated good adherence to the GCBs, measured by surface energy. The dispersion of &#945;-tocopherol in TPC, with cavitation energy 960â¯J·mL-1, promoted greater stability (greater zeta potential), thereby increasing antioxidant activity by 28% compared to TPS, therefore, was selected for a second stage. Incorporation of 2% bentonite into the TPC, with 10% &#945;-tocopherol, resulted in a 3.7â¯×â¯10-10 g·m-1·s-1·Pa-1 water vapor permeability, which is satisfactory for prevented of moisture gain during storage. The compressive load showed values of 375â¯N to the non-coated GCB and around 475â¯N with the insertion of coatings to the GCB. Thus, a TPC/&#945;-tocopherol/bentonite combination, dispersed with 960â¯J·mL-1 energy, was highly effective in the development of biopolymeric coatings for the GCBs.","Ferreira, Laura Fonseca; Figueiredo, Luísa Pereira; Martins, Maria Alice; Luvizaro, Lucas Baldo; de Lara, Bruna Rage Baldone; de Oliveira, Cassiano Rodrigues; Júnior, Mário Guimarães; Tonoli, Gustavo H D; Dias, Marali Vilela",Int. j. biol. macromol,,571

METHODS: Observational analysis of the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey from 2005 to 2015. Primary outcomes were hospital-based ED closure and merger. Secondary outcomes were yearly ED visits per hospital-based ED and yearly hospital admissions per hospital bed. RESULTS: The total number of hospital-based EDs decreased from 4,500 in 2005 to 4,460 in 2015, with 200 closures, 138 mergers, and 160 new hospital-based EDs. While yearly ED visits per hospital-based ED exhibited a 28.6% relative increase (from 25,083 to 32,248), yearly hospital admissions per hospital bed had a 3.3% relative increase (from 45.4 to 43.9) from 2005 to 2015. The number of hospital admissions and hospital beds did not change significantly in urban areas and declined in rural areas. ED visits grew more uniformly across urban and rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: The number of hospital-based ED closures is small when accounting for mergers, but occurs as many more patients are presenting to a stable number of EDs in larger health systems, though rural areas may differentially affected. EDs were managing accelerating patient volumes alongside stagnant inpatient bed capacity.","Venkatesh, Arjun K; Janke, Alexander; Rothenberg, Craig; Chan, Edwin; Becher, Robert D",PLoS One,,571

A 26-year-old female patient presented with a visual field defect in her left eye for 2 days and decreased vision compared to her right eye. It was learned that the patient had a laboratory-proven COVID-19 infection with mild respiratory symptoms that did not require hospitalization 2 weeks ago. Fundus examination revealed retinal edema in the left eye area supplied by the CILRA. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography revealed a prominent hyperreflective band at the inner nuclear layer level. These findings led us to the diagnosis of isolated CILRA occlusion and PAMM associated with recent COVID-19.

Preventive measures such as hygiene, social distancing, and isolation, essential to stop the spread of coronavirus, are difficult to accomplish for vulnerable populations due to their living conditions. Seroepidemiological surveys are assets to measure the transmission for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Until July 1st, the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Barrio Padre Mugica, one of the largest slums in Buenos Aires City, was 5.9%. This study aimed to establish the prevalence of SARS- CoV-2 antibodies immunoglobulin G (IgG) immediately after the outbreak, and to identify neighbourhood, household and individual factors associated with seroconversion. The prevalence based on IgG was 53.4% (95% CI 52.8% to 54.1%). For each polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) confirmed case, nine people tested IgG positive, indicating a high rate of undetected (probably asymptomatic) infections. Hence, the high rate of undiagnosed people suggests that clinical criteria and epidemiological nexus should be considered. The high seroprevalence observed in the context of an intense epidemic in a vulnerable area might serve as a reference to other countries. This study contributes to future decision making by understanding population immunity against SARS-CoV2 and its relation to living conditions and foccus that comprehensive biosocial, household-level interventions are needed.","Figar, S.; Pagotto, V.; Luna, L.; Salto, J.; Manslau, M.

With social media often dictating the tones and trends of politics-related discussion, it is of paramount important to be able to study online chatter, especially in the run up to important voting events, like in the case of the upcoming November 3, 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. Limited access to social media data is often the first barrier to impede, hinder, or slow down progress, and ultimately our understanding of online political discourse. To mitigate this issue and try to empower the Computational Social Science research community, we decided to publicly release a massive-scale, longitudinal dataset of U.S. politics- and election-related tweets. This multilingual dataset that we have been collecting for over one year encompasses hundreds of millions of tweets and tracks all salient U.S. politics trends, actors, and events between 2019 and 2020. It predates and spans the whole period of Republican and Democratic primaries, with real-time tracking of all presidential contenders of both sides of the isle. After that, it focuses on presidential and vice-presidential candidates. Our dataset release is curated, documented and will be constantly updated on a weekly-basis, until the November 3, 2020 election and beyond. We hope that the academic community, computational journalists, and research practitioners alike will all take advantage of our dataset to study relevant scientific and social issues, including problems like misinformation, information manipulation, interference, and distortion of online political discourse that have been prevalent in the context of recent election events in the United States and worldwide.

To evaluate yield of universal laboratory testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in acute stroke patients and its impact on hyperacute stroke care. METHODS: Between weeks 14 and 18 in 2020, a protected code stroke protocol including infection control screening and laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 was prospectively implemented for all code stroke patients upon arrival to the emergency department. If infection control screen was positive, patients received protective hygienic measures and laboratory test results were available within four hours from testing. In patients with negative screen, laboratory results were available no later than the next working day. Door-to-imaging times of patients treated with thrombolysis or thrombectomy were compared with those of patients treated during the preceding weeks 1 to 13 in 2020. RESULTS: During the 4-weeks study period, 116 consecutive code stroke patients underwent infection control screen and laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2.

We developed dedicated bioinformatics pipelines to identify regional MTCs and to assess demographic factors potentially associated with their formation. RESULTS: The total number and the scale of MTCs varied from small household clusters identified in all regions, to a super-spreading event found in Uusimaa-FI. Specific age groups were more likely to belong to MTCs in different regions. The clustered sequences referring to the age groups 50-100 years old (y.o.) were increased in all regions two weeks after the establishment of the lockdown, while those referring to the age group 0-19 y.o. decreased only in those regions where schools' closure was combined with a lockdown.

This also applies to clinical practice in gastroenterology, which has, in many respects, undergone a recent digital transformation with numerous consequences that will impact patients and health care professionals in the near future. MHAs and MAs are considered to have great potential, especially for chronic diseases, as they can support the self-management of patients in many ways. Despite the great potential associated with the application of MHAs and MAs in gastroenterology and health care in general, there are numerous challenges to be met in the future, including both the ethical and legal aspects of applying this technology.

298814,A rise in social media utilization by U.S. neurology residency programs in the era of COVID-19,2021,"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) approaches to detect SARS-CoV-2 in municipal wastewater can provide unique information on the incidence or prevalence of COVID-19 in community. However, there are several technical challenges coupled with sewage sampling for SARS-CoV-2, including intermittent shedding of viruses, sampling time, volume, and frequency. Sampling schemes thus may need to be tailored to reach out highly sensitive, accurate, and reliable results. Herein, we compared the accuracy and threshold cycle (Ct) profiles of SARS-CoV-2 in Moore swabs, composite (16-h), and grab samples taken from sewage manholes (n = 17) at the Middle Eastern city of Tehran, Iran, on two occasions (November 2020 and May 2021). Samples were concentrated by polyethylene glycol precipitation and the corresponding Ct values for CDC 'N' and 'ORF1ab' assays were derived by means of real time RT-qPCR. Overall, the Moore swabs performed equal to samples composited over 16 h for qualitative monitoring, and 34/34 (100%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The 'N' assay showed the highest detection frequency as compared to 'ORF1ab'. The mean Moore swab Ct profiles were more consistent with 16 h composite sampling as compared with corresponding grab samples, providing hints as to the best sampling protocol to adopt when planning a sewage monitoring campaign particularly under WBE. Furthermore, our analyses on local differences showed somewhat higher virus copy numbers in the southern areas. The experimental design of this study revealed that the Moore swab and composite samples are more sensitive than grab samples, suggesting that the collection of grab samples may be inappropriate for characterizing total number of viral RNA copies in sewage samples. Given the transiently presence of human host-restricted infections such as SARS-CoV-2 and the simplicity and affordability of Moore swab, the method is well suited for disease surveillance in resource poor regions struggling with limited capacity for clinical testing.","Rafiee, Mohammad; Isazadeh, Siavash; Mohseni-Bandpei, Anoushiravan; Mohebbi, Seyed Reza; Jahangiri-Rad, Mahsa; Eslami, Akbar; Dabiri, Hossein; Roostaei, Kasra; Tanhaei, Mohammad; Amereh, Fatemeh",Sci Total Environ,,571
299046,COVID-19: clinical and laboratory manifestations in novel coronavirus infection,2020,"Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic there is a need for a rapid increase in intensive care and ventilation capacities. Delivery times for additional intensive care respirators are currently not foreseeable. An option to increase ventilation capacities not only for COVID-19, but for all patients requiring mechanical ventilation is to use home respirators. Home respirators are turbine respirators, so they can usually be operated without high-pressure oxygen connections and can therefore also be used in areas outside the classical intensive care medical infrastructure. Due to their limited technical features, home respirators are not suitable for the treatment of severely affected patients but can be used for weaning after respiratory improvement, which means that intensive care respirators are available again more quickly. Respiratory therapists are specially trained nurses or therapists in the field of out of hospital ventilation and can independently use home ventilation respirators, for example for weaning in the intensive care unit. Thus, they relieve intensive care nursing staff in the pandemic. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic medical students from the Oldenburg University are currently being trained in operating home respirators to provide basic support in the hospital if necessary.","Summ, O; Schute, J; Byhahn, C; Kahle, T; Herrmann, M; Schulte, C; Bergold, M N; Groß, M",Anaesthesist,,571
299081,Global analysis of the infection by COVID-19,2020,"Several studies have reported clinical manifestations of the new coronavirus disease. However, few studies have systematically evaluated the neuropsychiatric complications of COVID-19. We reviewed the medical records of 201 patients with confirmed COVID-19 (52 outpatients and 149 inpatients) that were treated in a large referral center in Tehran, Iran from March 2019 to May 2020. We used clustering approach to categorize clinical symptoms. One hundred and fifty-one patients showed at least one neuropsychiatric symptom. Limb force reductions, headache followed by anosmia, hypogeusia were among the most common neuropsychiatric symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that neuropsychiatric symptoms group together in three distinct groups: anosmia and hypogeusia; dizziness, headache, and limb force reduction; photophobia, mental state change, hallucination, vision and speech problem, seizure, stroke, and balance disturbance. Three non-neuropsychiatric cluster of symptoms included diarrhea and nausea; cough and dyspnea; and fever and weakness. Neuropsychiatric presentations are very prevalent and heterogeneous in patients with coronavirus 2 infection and these heterogeneous presentations may be originating from different underlying mechanisms. Anosmia and hypogeusia seem to be distinct from more general constitutional-like and more specific neuropsychiatric symptoms. Skeletal muscular manifestations might be a constitutional or a neuropsychiatric symptom.","Mirfazeli, Fatemeh Sadat; Sarabi-Jamab, Atiye; Jahanbakhshi, Amin; Kordi, Alireza; Javadnia, Parisa; Shariat, Seyed Vahid; Aloosh, Oldooz; Almasi-Dooghaee, Mostafa; Faiz, Seyed Hamid Reza",Sci Rep,,571

299555,COVID-19: Potential Implications for International Security Environment-- Overview of Issues and Further Reading for Congress,2020,"We present here a study about the possible spread of covid-19 pandemic between human’s beings through aerosols contained in urban air polluted by respirable particulate matter and tropospheric ozone, as well as the incidence of local meteorology in an area with orographic basin characteristics and in a certain period of time. Hourly time-series data of three meteorological variables—temperature, relative humidity, wind speed—and three pollutants—PM10, PM2.5 and O3—were considered together with hourly data from the highest number accumulated sick's in seven communes—chosen at random—in Santiago, Chile, studying a probable link between them. From the epidemic perspective, the infected patients number was linked to the hourly time-series of meteorological and pollutant variables, generating new time-series. Nonlinear analysis and the chaos theory formalism was applied to these new time-series, obtaining the largest Lyapunov exponent, correlation dimension, Kolmogorov entropy, Hurst exponent and the Lempel-Ziv complexity. Our preliminary results show meteorological and air pollution variables can be part of the elements fraction that give sustainability to the accumulated growth of infected patients and favor the pandemic spread, making the accumulated sick’s curve chaotic and complex. In addition, environmental pollution could worsen disease conditions like coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. For all time-series, the Lempel-Ziv complexity turned out to be between 0 and 1 which is indicative of connectivity and chaos. The largest Lyapunov exponent as well as the Kolmogorov entropy were positive which also exhibits chaos. The Hurst exponent was found to be greater than 0.5 and less than 1 for all time-series, indicating positive long-term autocorrelation. Finally, the correlation dimension was less than 5, revealing that new time-series constructed are not random. © 2021, AAGR Aerosol and Air Quality Research. All rights reserved.","Salini, G.

The present study aimed to evaluate the involvement of the human endogenous retrovirus -W envelope (HERV-W ENV) in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection considering recent findings that HERVs are activated in response to infectious agents and lead to various immunopathological effects. We analysed HERV-W ENV expression in blood cells of COVID-19 patients in correlation with clinical characteristics and have discussed its potential role in the outcome of the disease. METHODS: We analysed HERV-W ENV expression in blood samples of COVID-19 patients and healthy donors by flow cytometry and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR analysis, and evaluated its correlation with clinical signs, inflammatory markers, cytokine expression, and disease progression. FINDINGS: HERV-W ENV was highly expressed in the leukocytes of COVID-19 patients but not in those of healthy donors. Its expression correlated with the markers of T-cell differentiation and exhaustion and blood cytokine levels. The percentage of HERV-W ENV-positive lymphocytes correlated with inflammatory markers and pneumonia severity in COVID-19 patients. Notably, HERV-W ENV expression reflects the respiratory outcome of patients during hospitalization. INTERPRETATION: Given the known immuno- and neuro-pathogenicity of HERV-W ENV protein, it could promote certain pathogenic features of COVID-19 and therefore serve as a biomarker to predict clinical progression of disease and open to further studies for therapeutic intervention.

Low-wage workers were hit particularly hard, including restaurant workers. The production and distribution of food being essential and agri-food supply chains being resilient, other workers in the agri-food sector were less impacted by public health measures and the pandemic. Employment in grocery stores remained steady and employment of agricultural workers, including temporary foreign workers, proved more robust than expected. Dealing with contaminated workers proved challenging in meat processing plants. Temporary plant shutdowns and slowdowns created livestock queuing problems and temporary increases in meat prices. The federal and provincial governments implemented several programs to mitigate the pandemic's adverse effects on labor markets. The pandemic will have permanent effect on labor markets, but with unemployment rates falling rapidly across Canada, recruiting and retention remain the main labor issues in agriculture.","Larue, Bruno",Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics/Revue canadienne d&#039;agroeconomie,,571

METHODS: We extracted the data from a case series of 7624 patients presented at Mount Sinai Health System, in New York for testing between 3/28/2020 and 4/16/2020. De-identified patient data set is being produced by the Scientific Computing department and made available to the Mount Sinai research community at the following website: https://msdw.mountsinai.org/ . RESULTS: Of 7624 COVID-19 patients, 7.8% (n = 597) had CKD on hospital admission, and 11.2% (n = 856) died of COVID-19 infection. CKD patients were older, more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), were current or former smokers, had a longer time to discharge, and had worse survival compared to non-CKD patients (p < 0.05). COVID-19 mortality rate was significantly higher in CKD patients (23.1% vs 10.2%) with a 1.51 greater odds of dying (95% CI: 1.19-1.90). Controlling for demographic, behavioral, and clinical covariates, the logistic regression analysis showed significant and consistent effects of CKD, older age, male gender, and hypertension with mortality (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: CKD was a significant independent predictor of COVID-19 mortality, along with older age, male gender, and hypertension.

Among medicinal plants that are widespread and exhibit multidirectional pharmacological activity, licorice should be noted. The active components contained in licorice, i.e. more than 20 triterpenoids and about 300 flavonoids coupled with glycyrrhizic acid (GL) referred to by the term ""glycyrrhizin"", have been widely studied for a long time. GL acts indirectly, interferes with the penetration of the virus into the cell, affects the components (HMGB1 protein) necessary for normal viral reproduction, and potentiates the production of interferon y and a. GL acts against SARS-associated coronavirus infection by inducing the synthesis of nitric oxide synthase, which inhibits viral replication. However, GL may also be helpful in acute respiratory distress syndrome. The combination of the multidirectional pharmacological effects of GL and its derivatives make the licorice-containing preparations promising components of complex antiviral therapy.

Therefore, we outline sexual dimorphisms which exist in particular host factors and elaborate on how they may contribute to the pronounced severity in male COVID-19 patients. This includes disparities detected in comorbidities, the ACE2 receptor, renin-angiotensin system (RAS), signaling molecules involved in SARS-CoV-2 replication, proteases which prime viral S protein, the immune response, and behavioral considerations. Moreover, we discuss sexual disparities associated with other viruses and a possible gender-dependent response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. By specifically highlighting these immune-endocrine processes as well as behavioral factors that differentially exist between the genders, we aim to offer a better understanding in the variations of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity.","Wehbe, Zena; Hammoud, Safaa Hisham; Yassine, Hadi M; Fardoun, Manal; El-Yazbi, Ahmed F; Eid, Ali H",Front Immunol,,571

301904,The Effects of COVID-19 on Fruit and Vegetable Production,2020,"7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) is a natural flavonoid compound that act as Trk-B agonist. 7,8-DHF is also a potent antioxidant. When applied systematically, 7,8-DHF can pass through blood-brain barrier and exhibit potential therapeutic effects in several animal models of neurodegenerative disorders. This study investigates the remedial effects of 7,8-DHF on behavioral impairments and biochemical changes associated with aging with a species emphasis on cortex. For this purpose three experimental groups were formed which are young control group, old group and old-DHF groups. 5 mg/kg 7,8-DHF was administered intraperitoneally to old-DHF group for 3 weeks. We assessed the hang wire and adhesive removal performances of mice. Also, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and synaptic protein levels in the cortex were measured. We observed that chronic administration of 7,8-DHF improved behavioral performance of old mice. Besides, 7,8-DHF reversed MDA level which was increased in old control animals. However, 3 weeks application of 7,8-DHF failed to recover the levels of neuroinflammation markers (TNF-&#945; and IL-6) and synaptic proteins (PSD-95 and Synaptophysin) which were reduced in old group. These findings demonstrate that improvement of age-dependent behavioral impairments and MDA levels by 7,8-DHF could be attributed to its antioxidant actions.","Keser, Hatice; Dogramaci, Seniz; Sahin, Elif; Saglam, Neslihan; Erdem, Mehmet; Alver, Ahmet; Aydin-Abidin, Selcen",Gen Physiol Biophys,,571

302964,Bioactive Lipids and Environmental Impact in COVID-19 Infections,2021,"Seabirds are widely used as indicators of marine pollution, including mercury (Hg), because they track contaminant levels across space and time. However, many seabirds are migratory, and it is difficult to understand the timing and location of their Hg accumulation. Seabirds may obtain Hg thousands of kilometers away, during their non-breeding period, and deposit that Hg into their terrestrial breeding colonies. We predicted that Hg concentration in rectrices reflects exposure during the previous breeding season, in body feathers reflects non-breeding exposure, and in blood collected during breeding reflects exposure during current breeding. To test this hypothesis, we measured total Hg concentration in these three tissues, which reflect different timepoints during the annual cycle of rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) breeding on both sides of the North Pacific (Middleton Island in Alaska and Teuri Island in Hokkaido), and tracked their wintering movement patterns with biologging devices. We (i) identify the wintering patterns of both populations, (ii) examine Hg levels in different tissues representing exposure at different time periods, (iii) test how environmental Hg exposure during the non-breeding season affects bird contamination, and (iv) assess whether variation in Hg levels during the non-breeding season influences levels accumulated in terrestrial plants. Individuals from both populations followed a figure-eight looping migration pattern. We confirm the existence of a pathway from environmental Hg to plant roots via avian tissues, as Hg concentrations were higher in plants within the auklet colonies than at control sites. Hg concentrations of breast feathers were higher in Alaskan than in Japanese auklets, but Hg concentrations in rectrices and blood were similar. Moreover, we found evidence that tissues with different turnover rates could record local anthropogenic Hg emission rates of areas visited during winter. In conclusion, Hg was transported across thousands of kilometers by seabirds and transferred to local plants.","Shoji, Akiko; Elliott, Kyle H; Watanuki, Yutaka; Basu, Niladri; Whelan, Shannon; Cunningham, Joshua; Hatch, Scott; Mizukawa, Hazuki; Nakayama, Shouta M M; Ikenaka, Yoshinori; Ishizuka, Mayumi; Aris-Brosou, Stéphane",Environ Pollut,,571

303804,Response to COVID-19 Zooming in on online process drama,2020,"BACKGROUND: Informal carers suffer from worse health outcomes than non-carers due to their caregiving role. Yet, in a society carers health is as important as that of their care recipients. This study investigated the self-assessed mental and general health outcomes of informal carers in Australia. It evaluated the influence of carers' personal social capital- a logically linked sequence of their social behaviour such as community participation, social support and trust in others- on their health outcomes. The study estimated the magnitude of small area level variation at Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) along with individual level variation in carers' health outcomes. METHODS: The study used a multilevel mixed effects cross-sectional design using data from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics of Australia survey, wave 14. It included Australians aged 15 years and older that were surveyed in the year 2014. The sample consisted of 12,767 individuals and 5004 SA1s. The outcome measures included- mental health, general health and physical functioning, domains of the Short Form 36 Questionnaire, a widely used multi-dimensional measure of health-related quality of life. RESULTS: Informal carers suffered from poor mental (Beta = - 0.587, p = 0.003) and general health (Beta = - 0.670, p = 0.001) outcomes compared to non-carers in Australia. These health outcomes exhibited significant variation acrossSA1s in Australia, with 12-13% variation in general and mental health. However, within small local areas, differences at the individual level, accounted for most of the variation in outcomes. Moreover, levels of community participation, personal social connection and trust, as perceived by individuals in the communities, had a positive influence on both mental and general health of carers and non-carers, and were more beneficial for carers compared to non-carers. CONCLUSION: It seems that the positive influence of social capital for carers helps them in coping with the negative impact of their caregiving duty on health outcomes. Findings suggested that some targeted community support programs for carers to build on their personal social cohesion and trust in their community could help in improving their poor health profiles. Moreover, improved informal carers' health may help the health system in better managing their resources.","Mohanty, Itismita; Niyonsenga, Theo; Cochrane, Tom; Rickwood, Debra",BMC Public Health,,571

304486,Interview to Lucia Zannini University post COVID-19,2020,"Water stable isotopes have been widely used as natural tracers to investigate soil-plant-atmosphere interactions. Recent developments in induction module cavity ring-down spectroscopy (IM-CRDS) have made it possible to rapidly complete isotope analyses, and to combust co-extracted organic compounds at the same time. However, the agreement between IM-CRDS and isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) analyses has generally been poor and was primarily attributable to spectral interference of IM-CRDS. Here we evaluated the impacts of organic contamination on the isotope ratios using IM-CRDS with two different methods. No spectral interference was observed for solid samples measured directly by IM-CRDS, whereas clear organic contamination occurred in isotope analyses for pre-extracted plant stem and leaf samples. Our results demonstrate that IM-CRDS can fully combust co-extracted organic compounds by in-line oxidation in the direct measurement of solid samples, although this may not guarantee that the IM-CRDS can obtain better isotopic data than IRMS. It may be risky to evaluate the performance of IM-CRDS by measuring pre-extracted water samples because cryogenic vacuum distillation is likely to introduce extra organic compounds, which may not be fully removed during subsequent IM-CRDS measurement. In addition, spectral variables are useful for post-processing corrections.","Cui, Jiangpeng; Lide, Tian; Yu, Wusheng",Isotopes Environ Health Stud,,571
305288,COVID-19 has taught us not to wait for help with grief,2020,"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented an unprecedented challenge to the orthopedic residency training programs to adapt to a form of a web-based learning process and simulation-based training. This study focusses on the viewpoint of the orthopedic residents to the paradigm shift in clinical care as well as the academic activities. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was created in an online survey generator and was sent through e-mail to 227 orthopedic residents of seven tertiary care centres in North India. The questionnaire was divided into three sections, academic activity section, mental health section, and clinical activity section. There were a total of 44 single answer questions with answers according to the increasing difficulty at present situation compared to a previous time before the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 158 questionnaires were filled by 107 junior residents (67.7%) and 51 senior residents (32.3%). 49 residents (31%) were quarantined and three became positive for COVID-19. Although all of them knew about necessary precautions, personal protective equipment was difficult to avail at times. Increased difficulty in recruiting new patients for research (48.9%) and conducting prospective research (48.7%) was observed. The online-based learning process was reported to be easier (44.2%) by most of the residents. Routine clinical work in the operating room, out-patient department, and inpatient department was found to be difficult according to the majority of the residents along with the anxiety of contracting the infection. CONCLUSION: There are unique opportunities for improvement of residency programs during these times of uncertainty and the findings of this study can help the universities as well as program chairs to develop a robust program that can outlive this pandemic. The web-based learning process might prove to be useful and can be incorporated into the resident training program in the long term.

305651,"Trends in migration, unemployment and population: A post-covid-19 forecast of capacity development in the Gambia",2020,"BACKGROUND: Few small studies have described hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) occurring in patients with COVID-19. RESEARCH QUESTION: What characteristics in critically ill patients with COVID-19 are associated with HAIs and how are HAIs associated with outcomes in these patients? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Multicenter retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data including adult patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to eight Italian hub hospitals from February 20, 2020, through May 20, 2020. Descriptive statistics and univariate and multivariate Weibull regression models were used to assess incidence, microbial cause, resistance patterns, risk factors (ie, demographics, comorbidities, exposure to medication), and impact on outcomes (ie, ICU discharge, length of ICU and hospital stays, and duration of mechanical ventilation) of microbiologically confirmed HAIs. RESULTS: Of the 774 included patients, 359 patients (46%) demonstrated 759 HAIs (44.7 infections/1,000 ICU patient-days; 35% multidrug-resistant [MDR] bacteria). Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP; n = 389 [50%]), bloodstream infections (BSIs; n = 183 [34%]), and catheter-related BSIs (n = 74 [10%]) were the most frequent HAIs, with 26.0 (95% CI, 23.6-28.8) VAPs per 1,000 patient intubation-days, 11.7 (95% CI, 10.1-13.5) BSIs per 1,000 ICU patient-days, and 4.7 (95% CI, 3.8-5.9) catheter-related BSIs per 1,000 ICU patient-days. Gram-negative bacteria (especially Enterobacterales) and Staphylococcus aureus caused 64% and 28% of cases of VAP, respectively. Variables independently associated with infection were age, positive end expiratory pressure, and treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics at admission. Two hundred thirty-four patients (30%) died in the ICU (15.3 deaths/1,000 ICU patient-days). Patients with HAIs complicated by septic shock showed an almost doubled mortality rate (52% vs 29%), whereas noncomplicated infections did not affect mortality. HAIs prolonged mechanical ventilation (median, 24 days [interquartile range (IQR), 14-39 days] vs 9 days [IQR, 5-13 days]; P < .001), ICU stay (24 days [IQR, 16-41 days] vs 9 days [IQR, 6-14 days]; P = .003), and hospital stay (42 days [IQR, 25-59 days] vs 23 days [IQR, 13-34 days]; P < .001). INTERPRETATION: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 are at high risk for HAIs, especially VAPs and BSIs resulting from MDR organisms. HAIs prolong mechanical ventilation and hospitalization, and HAIs complicated by septic shock almost doubled mortality.

In some patients, the resulting hyperinflammation resembles a cytokine release syndrome. Our knowledge of the immunopathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 is evolving and anti-cytokine therapies are under active investigation. This narrative review summarizes existing knowledge of the immune response to coronavirus infection and highlights the current and potential future roles of therapeutic strategies to combat the hyperinflammatory response of patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Data Sources: Relevant and up-to-date literature, media reports, and author experiences were included from Medline, national newspapers, and public clinical trial databases. Study Selection: The authors selected studies for inclusion by consensus. Data Extraction: The authors reviewed each study and selected approrpriate data for inclusion through consensus. Data Synthesis: Hyperinflammation, reminiscent of cytokine release syndromes such as macrophage activation syndrome and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, appears to drive outcomes among adults with severe coronavirus disease 2019. Cytokines, particularly interleukin-1 and interleukin-6, appear to contribute importantly to such systemic hyperinflammation. Ongoing clinical trials will determine the efficacy and safety of anti-cytokine therapies in coronavirus disease 2019. In the interim, anti-cytokine therapies may provide a treatment option for adults with severe coronavirus disease 2019 unresponsive to standard critical care management, including ventilation. Conclusions: This review provides an overview of the current understanding of the immunopathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 in adults and proposes treatment considerations for anti-cytokine therapy use in adults with severe disease.","Buckley, Leo F; Wohlford, George F; Ting, Clara; Alahmed, Abdullah; Van Tassell, Benjamin W; Abbate, Antonio; Devlin, John W; Libby, Peter",Crit Care Explor,,571

The present analysis used dietary intake data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2013-2016 (egg consumers: 2-18 years-old, N = 956; 19+ years-old, N = 2424). Inflation adjusted food cost and the cost of nutrients were obtained from the Center for Nutrition Promotion and Policy food cost database. Cost and nutrient profiles for What We Eat in America food categories were compared to whole eggs. Of the 15 main food groups examined, whole eggs ranked third for lowest cost per 100 g (excluding beverages), such that eggs cost 0.35 USD per 100 g, with dairy and grains representing the first and second most cost-efficient foods, at 0.23 USD and 0.27 USD per 100 g, respectively. In children and adults, eggs represented a cost-efficient food for protein delivery, such that eggs provided nearly 2.7% and 3.7% of all protein in the diet, respectively, at a cost of about 0.03 USD per g of protein. Eggs contributed 3.8% and 6.0% of all vitamin A in the diet of children and adults, at a cost of approximately 0.002 USD and 0.003 USD per RAE mcg of vitamin A, respectively. In children 2-18 years-old, nearly 12% of all choline in the diet is delivered from eggs, at a cost of approximately 0.002 USD per mg of choline. Similarly, in adults 19-years-old+, eggs provide nearly 15% of all dietary choline in the diet, at a cost of approximately 0.002 USD per mg of choline. Eggs provide nearly 5% and 9.5% of all vitamin D in the diet of children and adults, at a cost of approximately 0.21 USD and 0.22 USD per mcg of vitamin D, respectively. Overall, eggs ranked as the most cost-efficient food for delivering protein, choline, and vitamin A, second for vitamin E, and third for vitamin D in children. In adults, eggs ranked as the most cost-efficient food for delivering protein and choline, second for vitamin A, and third for vitamin D and vitamin E.

306622,Provision of medication abortion in Hawai'i during COVID-19: Practical experience with multiple care delivery models,2021,"Work organization and relationships have changed over recent decades. Following the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the norms concerning work-related standards will likely change even more significantly. There has been a shift away from standard employment to non-standard employment (NSE), which includes fixed-term, part-time, on-call, agency-related employment, dependent self-employment, dispatch, and temporary employment, etc. in nearly every sector. The health sector is no exception. However, the effects of non-standard employment on the disaster preparedness of health systems, particularly on hospitals' emergency and disaster plans, have not yet been adequately studied. Most crucial themes are engagement of non-standard employees in emergency and disaster planning and response, and the impact of non-standard employees in expanding hospitals' capacity in large-scale events. This short communication paper aims to discuss this neglected issue in hospital emergency and disaster planning. In order to see whether NSE is considered in hospital disaster and emergency plans, two hospital disaster and emergency planning guidelines-the Hospital Incident Command System, and the Hospital Emergency Response Checklist developed by the World Health Organization-were assessed regarding NSE in their respective contexts. Although these guidelines are comprehensive tools for hospital preparedness, NSE is not specifically considered in any of them. However, it is essential that NSE, with its trade-offs, is considered in disaster plans to maintain an effective implementation of them. Further research and actions are necessary, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, to identify how this reflection should be conducted and to supply evidence for further measures and revising emergency and disaster planning guidelines.","Tekeli-Yesil, Sidika; Kiran, Sibel",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,,571

The lipid composition of caveolae largely matches that of lipid rafts microdomains that are particularly enriched in cholesterol, sphingomyelin, glycosphingolipids, and saturated fatty acids. Unlike lipid rafts, whose existence remains quite elusive in living cells, caveolae can be clearly distinguished by electron microscope. Despite their similar composition and the sharing of some functions, lipid rafts appear more heterogeneous in terms of size and are more dynamic than caveolae. Following the discovery of caveolin-1, the first molecular marker as well as the unique scaffolding protein of caveolae, we have witnessed a remarkable increase in studies aimed at investigating the role of these organelles in cell functions and human disease. The goal of this review is to discuss the most recent studies related to the role of caveolae and caveolins in endothelial cells. We first recapitulate the major embryological processes leading to the formation of the vascular tree. We next discuss the contribution of caveolins and cavins to membrane biogenesis and cell response to extracellular stimuli.

Jahrhundert : Videogestützte Therapie in Zeiten von COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Recent advancements in wearable sensor technology have shown the feasibility of remote physical therapy at home. In particular, the current COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the need and opportunity of internet-based wearable technology in future health care systems. Previous research has shown the feasibility of human activity recognition technologies for monitoring rehabilitation activities in home environments; however, few comprehensive studies ranging from development to clinical evaluation exist. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1) develop a home-based rehabilitation (HBR) system that can recognize and record the type and frequency of rehabilitation exercises conducted by the user using a smartwatch and smartphone app equipped with a machine learning (ML) algorithm and (2) evaluate the efficacy of the home-based rehabilitation system through a prospective comparative study with chronic stroke survivors. METHODS: The HBR system involves an off-the-shelf smartwatch, a smartphone, and custom-developed apps. A convolutional neural network was used to train the ML algorithm for detecting home exercises. To determine the most accurate way for detecting the type of home exercise, we compared accuracy results with the data sets of personal or total data and accelerometer, gyroscope, or accelerometer combined with gyroscope data. From March 2018 to February 2019, we conducted a clinical study with two groups of stroke survivors. In total, 17 and 6 participants were enrolled for statistical analysis in the HBR group and control group, respectively. To measure clinical outcomes, we performed the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity, grip power test, Beck Depression Inventory, and range of motion (ROM) assessment of the shoulder joint at 0, 6, and 12 months, and at a follow-up assessment 6 weeks after retrieving the HBR system. RESULTS: The ML model created with personal data involving accelerometer combined with gyroscope data (5590/5601, 99.80%) was the most accurate compared with accelerometer (5496/5601, 98.13%) or gyroscope data (5381/5601, 96.07%). In the comparative study, the drop-out rates in the control and HBR groups were 40% (4/10) and 22% (5/22) at 12 weeks and 100% (10/10) and 45% (10/22) at 18 weeks, respectively. The HBR group (n=17) showed a significant improvement in the mean WMFT score (P=.02) and ROM of flexion (P=.004) and internal rotation (P=.001). The control group (n=6) showed a significant change only in shoulder internal rotation (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that a home care system using a commercial smartwatch and ML model can facilitate participation in home training and improve the functional score of the WMFT and shoulder ROM of flexion and internal rotation in the treatment of patients with chronic stroke. This strategy can possibly be a cost-effective tool for the home care treatment of stroke survivors in the future.

Those dying with-but not of-COVID-19 may still be infectious, however. While multiple guidelines have been issued regarding autopsy protocol in cases of suspected COVID-19 deaths, there is some variability in the recommendations. Additionally, limited recommendations to date have been issued regarding scene investigative protocol, and there is a paucity of publications characterizing COVID-19 postmortem gross and histologic findings.

By the analysis of RNA-sequencing data of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells combined with data mining we identified genes involved in COVID-19 progression. To characterize their implication in the fibrosis development we established a correlation matrix based on the transcriptomic data of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. With this method, we have identified a cluster of genes responsible for SARS-CoV-2-fibrosis including its entry receptor ACE2 and epidermal growth factor EGF. Then, we developed Vi-Fi scoring-a novel drug repurposing approach and simultaneously quantified antiviral and antifibrotic activities of the drugs based on their transcriptomic signatures. We revealed the strong dual antifibrotic and antiviral activity of EGFR/ErbB inhibitors. Before the in vitro validation, we have clustered 277 cell lines and revealed distinct COVID-19 transcriptomic signatures of the cells with similar phenotypes that defines their suitability for COVID-19 research. By ERK activity monitoring in living lung cells, we show that the drugs with predicted antifibrotic activity downregulate ERK in the host lung cells. Overall, our study provides novel insights on SARS-CoV-2 dependence on EGFR/ERK signaling and demonstrates the utility of EGFR/ErbB inhibitors for COVID-19 treatment.","Vagapova, Elmira R; Lebedev, Timofey D; Prassolov, Vladimir S",Sci Rep,,571

The purpose of this study was to explore how parents experienced the pandemic-related restrictions and how they impacted their children's movement behaviours. Methods: Twenty-nine semi-structured one-on-one interviews were conducted (June-July 2020) with parents of children (5-11 years old) in Ontario and British Columbia. Interviews lasted between 24-104 min, were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed. Results: Findings emphasized various individual (e.g., motivation), interpersonal (e.g., parent work schedule), built (e.g., closure of parks) and natural environment (e.g., weather) factors related to children's movement behaviours. The findings highlighted the loss of structured activities and destinations for children's physical activity, and restricted opportunities for outdoor play exacerbated by shrinking childhood independent mobility. Conclusion: Families are adapting to many pandemic-related challenges including adhering to public health restrictions, parents juggling multiple roles, conducting work and school from home, as well as exacerbating factors like weather. It will be important to continue to encourage outdoor time, support policies and practice that facilitate independent mobility, and develop centralized resources that help families in the maintenance of healthy movement behaviours.","Riazi, Negin A; Wunderlich, Kelly; Gierc, Madelaine; Brussoni, Mariana; Moore, Sarah A; Tremblay, Mark S; Faulkner, Guy",,,571

Although the mortality rate was high in patients with smokers compared to healthy patients (4.22%, the hazard ratio [HR], 1.358; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.542-1.100; p = .014), it was less than in diabetics (7.04%, HR 1.531, 95% CI: 1.668-1.337, p = .000), and diabetic plus smoker (10.00%, HR, 1.659; 95% CI, 1.763-1.510; p = .000). CONCLUSION: Multiple comorbidities are closely related to the severity of COVID-19 disease progression and the higher mortality rate. Smokers presented as mild cases compared to diabetic and diabetic + smoking patients, who presented as severe to critical cases. Although a higher death rate in smokers was seen compared with healthy patients, this was smaller when compared to diabetic and diabetic + smoking patients.","Abbas, Hassan M; Nassir, Kawthar F; Al Khames Aga, Qutaiba A; Al-Gharawi, Ali A; Rasheed, Jawad I; Al-Obaidy, Muhammed W; Al Jubouri, Adnan M; Jaber, Ali S; Al Khames Aga, Luma A",J. med. virol,,571

Fifth Edition, Updated Estimates and Analysis",2020,"While the potential macro-economic benefits of tourism development have been well-established, the negative social effects of uninhibited growth have received increased attention in the last decade, emphasizing the central role of communities in the search for a sustainable balance in tourism. This paper focuses on the relatively underdeveloped Scheldeland region in Flanders (Belgium), where a strategic goal is to leverage cultural and natural heritage to boost development. Via a resident questionnaire based on a simplified version of the Resident Empowerment through Tourism Scale (RETS), we identified support for tourism development and deconstructed the drivers of this support. The objective was to empirically validate the research instrument and underlying theory in a situation of relative ‘undertourism’ and prospective future growth. The questionnaire collected 2058 responses, and the partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) results indicated that support for tourism, which was generally high across the seven municipalities, was mainly affected by social, psychological, and political empowerment, with personal economic benefits not playing a significant role. These results show that social exchange theory (SET) as a theoretical basis for potential tourism support has limited validity in currently underdeveloped destinations. Secondly, comparatively speaking, the municipalities with the lowest tourism development were least supportive of tourism growth, with an increase in tourism intensity seemingly leading to increasing support due to a higher awareness of accrued benefits through tourism.","Neuts, Bart Senne Kimps van der Borg Jan",Sustainability,,571

METHODS: A mixed method online survey was created and distributed to all GP surgeries in the catchment area of the hospital with a 6 week response period. RESULTS: Although the majority of GPs are satisfied with the service they receive, there were areas for improvement. Key areas included methods of contacting radiology department with queries, report content/terminology and recommendations for follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Although the majority of GPs are happy for radiographers to report imaging examinations some resistance was encountered, particularly with regards to chest reporting. Recommendations are made for improvements designed to address these issues. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This article is one of the first in the UK to assess GP satisfaction with general X-ray reporting services. As the majority of GP reporting in the UK is now completed by radiographers, the results will allow reporting teams to tailor their service, in order to improve outcomes for both commissioners and patients.","Milner, R C; Barlow, N",,,571

310926,COVID-19 Nordic Responses,2020,"The current study examines differences between COVID-19 vaccine intention and delay. A survey was administered to 585 US respondents in late November 2020 as part of an online longitudinal study. Respondents provided information on whether they would obtain a COVID-19 vaccine, once available, and how long they intended to wait before obtaining it. In the negative intention group, 3.4% reported waiting a few weeks, 34.0% waiting a few months, and 62.6% never getting vaccinated. In multivariable models, social norms were a significant and independent predictor of all vaccine delay and intention models. Vaccine delay was associated with low levels of worry about becoming infected with COVID-19, political conservatism, concerns about vaccine side effects, and low levels of believing a vaccine would be effective. Negative vaccine intentions were associated with worries about becoming infected with COVID-19, concerns about vaccine side effects, beliefs that the vaccines were developed too quickly, and low endorsement of the altruistic belief that older people should have vaccination priority. The study results highlight the importance of a multifactorial approach to assessing vaccine attitudes. The findings suggest that uptake programs should focus on enhancing pro-vaccine norms.","Latkin, Carl; Dayton, Lauren; Yi, Grace; Jaleel, Afareen; Nwosu, Chikaodinaka; Limaye, Rupali",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,571

COVID-19 vaccines are no exception. Social media use plays a role in low acceptance of vaccines. OBJECTIVE: This study will identify the topics and sentiments in the public COVID-19 vaccine-related discussion on social media and discern the salient changes in topics and sentiments over time in order to better understand the public perceptions, concerns, and emotions that may influence the achievement of herd immunity goals. METHODS: Tweets were downloaded from a large-scale COVID-19 Twitter chatter data set from March 11, 2020, when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, to January 31, 2020. We used R (The R Foundation) to clean the tweets and retain tweets that contained the following keywords: ""vaccination"", ""vaccinations"", ""vaccine"", ""vaccines"", ""immunization"", ""vaccinate"", and ""vaccinated"". The final data set included in the analysis consisted of 1,499,421 unique tweets from 583,499 different users. We used R to perform the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm for topic modeling as well as the sentiment and emotion analysis using the NRC (National Research Council in Canada) Emotion Lexicon. RESULTS: Topic modeling COVID-19 vaccine tweets yielded 16 topics, which were grouped into 5 overarching themes. Opinions about vaccination (227,840 tweets, 15.2%) was the most tweeted topic and remained the most discussed topic in majority of the time of our examination. Vaccine progress around the world once became the most discussed topic around August 11, 2020 when Russia approved the world's first COVID vaccine. With the advancement of vaccine administration, the topic of instruction on getting vaccines gradually became more salient and leapt to the most discussed topic after the first week of January, 2021. Weekly mean sentiment scores showed that despite fluctuations, in general, the sentiment was increasingly positive. Emotion analysis further showed that trust was the most predominant emotion, followed by anticipation, fear, and sadness etc. Trust reached its peak on November 19, 2020 when Pfizer announced that its vaccine is 90% effective. CONCLUSIONS: Public COVID-19 vaccine-related discussion on Twitter was largely driven by major events about COVID-19 vaccines and mirrored the hot news in mainstream media. Discussion also demonstrated a global perspective. The increasingly positive sentiment around COVID-19 vaccines and the dominant emotion of trust shown in the social media discussion may imply a higher COVID-19 vaccine acceptance compared with previous vaccines.","Lyu, Joanne Chen; Han, Eileen Le; Luli, Garving K",J. med. internet res,,571

311353,Recovery of individual Service personnel in the COVID-19 recovery phase,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become one of the biggest public health challenges of this century. Severe forms of the disease are associated with a thrombo-inflammatory state that can turn into thrombosis. Because tissue factor (TF) conveyed by extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been implicated in thrombosis, we quantified the EV-TF activity in a cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n = 111) and evaluated its link with inflammation, disease severity, and thrombotic events. Patients with severe disease were compared with those who had moderate disease and with patients who had septic shock not related to COVID-19 (n = 218). The EV-TF activity was notably increased in patients with severe COVID-19 compared with that observed in patients with moderate COVID-19 (median, 231 [25th to 75th percentile, 39-761] vs median, 25 [25th to 75th percentile, 12-59] fM; P < .0001); EV-TF was correlated with leukocytes, D-dimer, and inflammation parameters. High EV-TF values were associated with an increased thrombotic risk in multivariable models. Compared with patients who had septic shock, those with COVID-19 were characterized by a distinct coagulopathy profile with significantly higher EV-TF and EV-fibrinolytic activities that were not counterbalanced by an increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Thus, this article is the first to describe the dissemination of extreme levels of EV-TF in patients with severe COVID-19, which supports the international recommendations of systematic preventive anticoagulation in hospitalized patients and potential intensification of anticoagulation in patients with severe disease.","Guervilly, Christophe; Bonifay, Amandine; Burtey, Stephane; Sabatier, Florence; Cauchois, Raphaël; Abdili, Evelyne; Arnaud, Laurent; Lano, Guillaume; Pietri, Léa; Robert, Thomas; Velier, Mélanie; Papazian, Laurent; Albanese, Jacques; Kaplanski, Gilles; Dignat-George, Françoise; Lacroix, Romaric",Blood Adv,,571

This survey aims to examine and evaluate risk factors for those patients who died of COVID and to identify any markers for improvement in the management of such patients during future COVID surges. Methods Medical records of all patients who died within a multi-ethnic, inner city acute district general hospital over a 6-week period in 2020 were examined. Data collected included demographic details, medical comorbidities, and type of ward where they received care. Multivariable analysis using stepwise backward logistic regression was conducted to examine independent risk factors for these patients. Results Of 275 deaths,204 were related to COVID. Compared to non-COVID deaths(n = 71), there were no age differences. There were significantly more deaths in males (58%vs39%,P &lt; 0.001)) and in Black African and South Asian groups. 18% of COVID deaths were those who were not frail (Frailty Rockwood Scale 1–3) whereas there were no non-COVID deaths in this group(P &lt; 0.001). 69% of COVID deaths occurred in general medical wards whereas 19% in critical care units (90% and 7% for non-COVID deaths,p &lt; 0.001). COVID patients died more quickly compared to non-COVID patients (length of stay mean, 11vs21,p &lt; 0.001).

Multivariable analyses showed males (OR 1.9), age &gt; 70(OR 2.0), frailty (OR 2.3) were independent risk factors for COVID deaths. Discussion Compared to non-COVID deaths,COVID deaths were more common in previously well individuals,males,Black African and South Asian ethnicity, but multivariable analyses showed males, age &gt; 70 and frailty were independent risk factors for COVID deaths.

Considering that obesity is a chronic disease and the possible effect imposed by quarantine on weight gain with worsening rates of obesity and metabolic comorbidities, the creation of a protocol for a safe return to bariatric surgery became essential. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the incidence of new-onset severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) symptoms in patients who underwent bariatric procedures during the declining curve period. SETTING: Private practice METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted and included patients with indications for bariatric surgery during the decreasing curve period of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic who underwent surgery under a hospital security protocol. Patients were asked to answer a questionnaire and had a swab PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The primary outcome measure was the presence of 14-day and 30-day postoperative symptoms associated with COVID-19. Mortality was also analyzed. RESULTS: Three hundred patients with negative RT-PCR were operated on from May to June 2020. Seventeen patients had their surgery postponed because of a positive RT-PCR test or close contact. None of the patients developed new-onset SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic infection after 30 days of observation. No deaths were reported. Eleven had complications not related to SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Even though this population may have a poorer outcome when infected with SARS-CoV-2, this security protocol has shown that the procedure can be safely performed during the outbreak.","Balieiro, Marcio P M; da Silva, Michel M; Coelho, Antônio C J; de Barros, Fernando; Saboya, Carlos; Ferraz, Leonardo R; Vieira, Mauricio E G; Benevenuto, Dyego Sá; de Oliveira E Silva, Luiz G; Lucas, Marcio; Valente, Fernando; Viegas, Fabio; Kaddoum, Fernando J; El-Kadre, Luciana J; Vaisman, Fernanda",Obes Surg,,571

314200,Health measures to travellers and cruise ships in response to COVID-19,2020,"The quantitative evaluations of nutrients delivered by submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) have been widely conducted worldwide, but sources of nutrients in the discharged submarine groundwater remain unclear. Identifying these sources of nutrients is essential to the protection and management of marine ecological environments. This study aims to evaluate the magnitudes of SGD and the associated nitrate in the Guangdong-Hongkong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GHM Greater Bay Area), China, and identify the sources of SGD-driven nitrate in this region using radioactive radium (Ra) isotopes (223Ra, 224Ra, and 228Ra) and stable nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) isotope composition of nitrate (Î´15N-NO3- and Î´18O-NO3-). The results of the Ra mixing model show that the estimated SGD and the associated nitrate fluxes into the Greater Bay Area are (9.15 ± 1.26) × 108 m3/d and (3.77 ± 0.52) × 107 mol/d, respectively, both of which are comparable to the contributions from the Pearl River. Combing NO3- dual isotopic signatures of sampled coastal groundwater and five kinds of potential nitrate sources, we found that ammonium (NH4+) fertilizer and natural soil N are the two main sources of nitrate in discharged submarine groundwater and rivers. No anthropogenic inputs from manure or sewage waste were identified. This study provides significant insights into the establishment of effective management strategies for controlling SGD-nutrients into the bay and protecting the marine ecological environment.","Wang, Xuejing; Zhang, Yan; Luo, Manhua; Xiao, Kai; Wang, Qianqian; Tian, Yong; Qiu, Wenhui; Xiong, Ying; Zheng, Chunmiao; Li, Hailong",Sci Total Environ,,571

314653,"What nurses do as routine, is special in the time of COVID-19",2020,"BACKGROUND: In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the German government and the 16 German federal states implemented a variety of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to decelerate the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and thus prevent a collapse of the health care system. These measures comprised, among others, social distancing, the temporary closure of shops and schools, and a ban of large public gatherings and meetings with people not living in the same household. OBJECTIVE: It is fair to assume that the issued NPIs have heavily affected social life and psychological functioning. We therefore aimed to examine possible effects of this lockdown in conjunction with daily new infections and the state of the national economy on people's interests, motives, and other psychological states. METHODS: We derived 249 keywords from the Google Trends database, tapping into 27 empirically and rationally selected psychological domains. To overcome issues with reliability and specificity of individual indicator variables, broad factors were derived by means of time series factor analysis. All domains were subjected to a change point analysis and time series regression analysis with infection rates, NPIs, and the state of the economy as predictors. All keywords and analyses were preregistered prior to analysis. RESULTS: With the pandemic arriving in Germany, significant increases in people's search interests were observed in virtually all domains. Although most of the changes were short-lasting, each had a distinguishable onset during the lockdown period. Regression analysis of the Google Trends data confirmed pronounced autoregressive effects for the investigated variables, while forecasting by means of the tested predictors (ie, daily new infections, NPIs, and the state of economy) was moderate at best. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that people's interests, motives, and psychological states are heavily affected in times of crisis and lockdown. Specifically, disease- and virus-related domains (eg, pandemic disease, symptoms) peaked early, whereas personal health strategies (eg, masks, homeschooling) peaked later during the lockdown. Domains addressing social life and psychosocial functioning showed long-term increases in public interest. Renovation was the only domain to show a decrease in search interest with the onset of the lockdown. As changes in search behavior are consistent over multiple domains, a Google Trends analysis may provide information for policy makers on how to adapt and develop intervention, information, and prevention strategies, especially when NPIs are in effect.","Rotter, Dominik; Doebler, Philipp; Schmitz, Florian",J Med Internet Res,,571

315234,"Age, ""Life-Cycles,"" and the Allocation of Scarce Medical Resources",2020,"OBJECTIVE: Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of people have been infected with thousands of deaths. Few data regarding factors that increase the risk of infection are available. Our study aimed to evaluate all people living in retirement homes (PLRNH) and identify factors that could increase infection risk in a close community. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study enrolling all PLRNH, where at least one SARS-CoV-2 infected person was present. Variables were compared with Student's t-test or Pearson chi-square test as appropriate. Uni- and multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate variables' influence on the infection. RESULTS: We included 452 PLRNH; 144 (31.7%) were male, with a mean age of 82.2±8.6 years. People with a positive swab for SARS-CoV-2 were 306 (67.4%). A significant difference between SARS-CoV-2 infected and not infected was observed in the percentage of those receiving chronic treatment with Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (18.6% vs. 9.5%, p=0.012). On the contrary, there was no difference in the proportion of those receiving ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) (21.2% vs. 23.6%, p=0.562). At multivariate analysis, people with mental illness and cancer had an increased risk of being infected. Furthermore, receiving ARBs as a chronic treatment was an independent predictor of infection risk [OR 1.95 (95% CI 1.03-3.72) p=0.041]. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that, in close communities, such as retirement nursing homes, the receipt of ARBs increased the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, before changing an important chronic treatment in a fragile population, such as the elderly living in retirement nursing homes, clinicians should carefully evaluate the risk-benefit ratio.","De Vito, A; Geremia, N; Princic, E; Fanelli, C; Panu Napodano, C M; Muredda, A A; Fiore, V; Maida, I; Fois, A G; Babudieri, S; Madeddu, G",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,571
315261,Estimating the Impact of Covid-19 on Poverty in Indonesia*,2020,"Purpose: Older persons have been identified as a vulnerable population with respect to the novel coronavirus outbreak, COVID-19. Aiming to ""flatten the curve"" a strict Movement Control Order (MCO) was implemented in Malaysia. Older adults with cognitive frailty are prone to physical, cognitive and psychosocial decline. This study aims to compare physical activity patterns, psychological wellbeing and coping strategies of older persons with cognitive frailty in the ""WE-RISE"" trial (intervention versus control) throughout this period. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted as a sub-analysis of the ongoing ""WE-RISE"" randomized controlled trial. This study included 42 community-dwelling older adults, aged 60 years and above, with cognitive frailty, stratified into intervention (n=21) and control (n=21) groups who are receiving a multi-domain intervention and usual care, respectively, within the Klang Valley, Malaysia. Phone call interviews were conducted during the MCO period. Physical activity patterns were assessed using International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). Psychological wellbeing was assessed using Flourishing Scale (FS) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), while the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (COPE) assessed coping strategies. Data were analysed descriptively and with independent samples t-test. Results: The WE-RISE intervention group had significantly higher levels of estimated resting energy expenditure (MET) for ""walking activity"" (I:µ=1723.1±780.7;C:µ=537.4±581.9)(p<0.001), ""moderate activity"" (I:µ=1422.8±1215.1;C:µ=405.7±746.9)(p=0.002) and ""total physical activity"" (I: µ=3625.9±3399.3;C:µ=994.6±1193.9)(p=0.002). The intervention group was also significantly more independent in functional activities (µ=1.76±1.73) as compared to the control group (µ=5.57±8.31) (p<0.05). Moreover, significant higher self-perception of living a meaningful life and feeling respected (p<0.05) was demonstrated in regard to psychological well-being in the intervention group. Regarding coping strategies, the intervention group relied significantly on the domains of religion (I:µ=6.43±0.99;C:µ=6.09±1.09)(p<0.05) and planning (I:µ=4.81±0.75; C:µ=4.04±1.28)(p<0.05) whilst the control group relied on humour (C:µ=3.14±1.19; I:µ=2.38±0.74)(p<0.05). Conclusion: Participants of the WE-RISE intervention group were more physically active, functionally independent and had higher self-perceived social-psychological prosperity regarding living a meaningful life and feeling respected; whilst both groups relied on positive coping strategies during the MCO. These results indicate that it is vital to ensure older persons with cognitive frailty remain physically active and preserve their psychosocial wellbeing to be more resilient in preventing further decline during a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Murukesu, Resshaya Roobini; Singh, Devinder Kaur Ajit; Shahar, Suzana; Subramaniam, Ponnusamy",Clin Interv Aging,,571

316041,A Positive Role of Negative Mood on Creativity: The Opportunity in the Crisis of the COVID-19 Epidemic,2020,"The causal closure of physics is usually discussed in a context free way. Here I discuss it in the context of engineering systems and biology, where strong emergence takes place due to a combination of upwards emergence and downwards causation (Ellis, Emergence in Solid State Physics and Biology, 2020, arXiv:2004.13591). Firstly, I show that causal closure is strictly limited in terms of spatial interactions because these are cases that are of necessity strongly interacting with the environment. Effective Spatial Closure holds ceteris parabus, and can be violated by Black Swan Events. Secondly, I show that causal closure in the hierarchy of emergence is a strictly interlevel affair, and in the cases of engineering and biology encompasses all levels from the social level to the particle physics level. However Effective Causal Closure can usefully be defined for a restricted set of levels, and one can experimentally determine Effective Theories that hold at each level. This does not however imply those effective theories are causally complete by themselves. In particular, the particle physics level is not causally complete by itself in the contexts of solid state physics (because of interlevel wave-particle duality), digital computers (where algorithms determine outcomes), or biology (because of time dependent constraints). Furthermore Inextricably Intertwined Levels occur in all these contexts.","Ellis, George F R",Found Phys,,571

X-ray imaging, although limited to specific visualizations, may be helpful for the diagnosis. In this study, the problem of automatic classification of pulmonary diseases, including the recently emerged COVID-19, from X-ray images, is considered. Methods: Deep Learning has proven to be a remarkable method to extract massive high-dimensional features from medical images. Specifically, in this paper, the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network called Mobile Net is employed and trained from scratch to investigate the importance of the extracted features for the classification task. A large-scale dataset of 3905 X-ray images, corresponding to 6 diseases, is utilized for training MobileNet v2, which has been proven to achieve excellent results in related tasks. Results: Training the CNNs from scratch outperforms the other transfer learning techniques, both in distinguishing the X-rays between the seven classes and between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19. A classification accuracy between the seven classes of 87.66% is achieved. Besides, this method achieves 99.18% accuracy, 97.36% Sensitivity, and 99.42% Specificity in the detection of COVID-19. Conclusion: The results suggest that training CNNs from scratch may reveal vital biomarkers related but not limited to the COVID-19 disease, while the top classification accuracy suggests further examination of the X-ray imaging potential.","Apostolopoulos, Ioannis D; Aznaouridis, Sokratis I; Tzani, Mpesiana A",J Med Biol Eng,,571

The study investigated whole-brain and regional brain glucose metabolism in HF patients and its association with depression comorbidity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-nine hospitalized patients with symptomatic systolic HF (left ventricular ejection fraction <40%), New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV and mean age of 55.5 ± 12.0 years, had psychometric questionnaires before discharge and an 18 F-FDG PET/CT brain scan after discharge. Semi-automated image analysis was performed on all cases and 30 matched controls. The metabolic parameter mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean ) was calculated for the whole brain and three brain regions implicated in depression pathogenesis. A standardized SUVmean was also estimated by dividing regional brain SUVmean with whole-brain SUVmean . Cases had lower average whole-brain SUVmean (3.90 ± 1.49 vs. 5.10 ± 1.35, P = 0.001) and average regional brain SUVmean (4.57 ± 2.31 vs. 9.96 ± 3.58, P < 0.001) compared to controls. Whole-brain SUVmean had a significant correlation with patient age, NYHA class, diabetes, creatinine levels, depression, and cognitive impairment. Regional brain SUVmean was correlated with whole-brain SUVmean and depression. The standardized SUVmean , in particular, was found to be a robust index that could differentiate HF patients with 'epiphenomenal' (>0.93) or 'real' (&#8804;0.93) depression. CONCLUSION: Heart failure patients with more severe disease showed whole-brain and regional brain hypometabolism in 18 F-FDG PET/CT. Depressed HF patients (Beck Depression Inventory score >13) exhibited different metabolic patterns that could be used to differentiate between 'epiphenomenal' and 'real' depression. Namely, presence of whole-brain hypometabolism suggested 'epiphenomenal' depression, whereas absence suggested 'real' depression. Presence of significant relative regional brain hypometabolism enhanced the likelihood of 'real' depression diagnosis.","Lyra, Vassiliki; Parissis, John; Kallergi, Maria; Rizos, Emmanouil; Filippatos, Gerasimos; Kremastinos, Dimitrios; Chatziioannou, Sofia",Eur. j. heart fail,,571

This study introduces a case of MIS-A, where the patient presented 3 weeks after initial COVID-19 exposure. His clinical course was consistent with the working definition of MIS-A as specified by the CDC. Aggressive supportive care in the intensive care unit, utilization of advanced heart failure devices, and immunomodulatory therapeutics (high-dose steroids, anakinra, intravenous immunoglobulin) led to clinical recovery. Management of MIS-A is a topic of ongoing research and needs more studies to elaborate on treatment modalities and clinical predictors.","Ahmad, Faran; Ahmed, Arslan; Rajendraprasad, Sanu S; Loranger, Austin; Gupta, Sonia; Velagapudi, Manasa; Vivekanandan, Renuga; Nahas, Joseph A; Plambeck, Robert; Moore, Douglas",Int J Infect Dis,,571
317709,"One Foe, so Many Fights Making Sense of Covid-19 Policies",2020,"There has been much discussion recently about the importance of implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to protect the public from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Different governments across the world have adopted NPIs (e.g., social distancing, quarantine, isolation, lockdowns, curfews, travel restrictions, closures of schools and colleges). Two fundamental strategies, namely a strict containment strategy-also called suppression strategy-and a mitigation strategy have been adopted in different countries, mainly to reduce the reproduction number (R0) to below one and hence to reduce case numbers to low levels or eliminate human-to-human transmission, as well as to use NPIs to interrupt transmission completely and to reduce the health impact of epidemics, respectively. However, the adoption of these NPI strategies is varied and the factors impacting NPI are inconsistent and unclear. This study, therefore, aimed to review the factors associated with the implementation of NPIs (social distancing, social isolation and quarantine) for reducing COVID-19. Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched for published and unpublished studies, undertaking a systematic search of: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Allied and Complementary Medicine, COVID-19 Research, WHO database on COVID-19, and Google Scholar. Thirty-three studies were included in the study. Seven descriptive themes emerged on enablers and barriers to NPIs: the positive impact of NPIs, effective public health interventions, positive change in people's behaviour and concerns about COVID-19, the role of mass media, physical and psychological impacts, and ethnicity/age associated with COVID-19. This study has highlighted that the effectiveness of NPIs in isolation is likely to be limited, therefore, a combination of multiple measures e.g., SD, isolation and quarantine, and workplace distancing appeared more effective in reducing COVID-19. Studies suggest that targeted approaches alongside social distancing might be the way forward, and more acceptable. Further research to promote country- and context-specific adoption of NPIs to deliver public health measures is needed. Studies comparing the effectiveness of interventions and strategies will help provide more evidence for future pandemics.","Regmi, Krishna; Lwin, Cho Mar",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,571

317986,Focus on the predictive management of COVID-19 risk in educational institutions in Morocco,2021,"Most Americans are at least three generations removed from the farm, thereby at least three generations removed from the reality of where their food comes from. Not surprisingly, there are many misconceptions about modern food production, including the potential collateral environmental damage attributed to agriculture, particularly the application of pesticides. However, the implication of conventional agriculture in the broader narrative of wildlife species status outcomes (SSOs) lacks context and relativity. Since the dawn of civilization, humans have had a profound impact on their environment. Originating as hunter-gatherer societies, our ancient ancestors initially exploited anything that could be consumed or brought to bear. With the advent of the ""first proto-farmers,"" humans began manipulating their environments to maximize available resources. Urban centers propagated and flourished proximal to agricultural origins, where modern societies have been built primarily on an abundance of food. As societies ""developed,"" and continue to develop, an inevitable economic transition occurs from agriculture to industry/service predominance, culminating in a corresponding shift in land use. Developed countries have typically experienced maximal expansion of the agricultural frontier, where farmland is now steadily eroding by a proverbial flood of urban development. In contrast, in developing countries, this shift in economic development has not yet fully manifested and the agricultural footprint continues to expand at the expense of native habitats. Thus, the relative influence of ""agriculture"" on SSOs, in terms of land use, is primarily dependent on economic developmental status, which can be, at least in part, ameliorated via technology by increasing yield from existing land. Moreover, in addition to the land use challenge, there are multiple other factors affecting wildlife SSOs, including a figurative plague of invasive species, a literal plague of disease, a barrage of buildings, bumpers, grilles, and windshields to collide with, light pollution to confuse cues with, poachers to contend with, and even more complicated factors such as climate change. Being an easy target does not mean pesticides are the right target, and this fixation can potentially detract from public awareness regarding the primary drivers affecting SSOs as well as the opportunity to proactively address them. So, relatively speaking, how do these other factors compare to ""pesticides"" in terms of driving SSOs? Moreover, why is the popular media so fixated on the pesticide narrative? Based on the available evidence, this manuscript attempts to address these questions from a holistic and relative perspective within the context of land use change, economic development, population growth, and associated implications of global connectivity and commerce.","Brain, Richard A; Anderson, Julie C",,,571

Neutralizing nanobodies (Nbs) are a potential therapeutic strategy for treating COVID-19. Here, we characterize several RBD-specific Nbs isolated from an Nb library derived from an alpaca immunized with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S);among them, three Nbs exhibit picomolar potency against SARS-CoV-2 live virus, pseudotyped viruses, and circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. To improve the efficacy, various configurations of Nbs are engineered. Nb15-NbH-Nb15, a trimer constituted of three Nbs, is constructed to be bispecific for human serum albumin (HSA) and RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Nb15-NbH-Nb15 exhibits single digit ng/ml neutralization potency against the wild-type and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2 with a long half-life in vivo. In addition, we show that intranasal administration of Nb15-NbH-Nb15 provides effective protection for both prophylactic and therapeutic purposes against SARS-CoV-2 infection in transgenic hACE2 mice. Nb15-NbH-Nb15 is a potential candidate for both prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory administration.

We recently introduced TaibUVID nutritional supplements (nigella sativa, chamomile and natural honey) as adjuvants for COVID-19 contacts, patients and public prophylaxis. TaibUVID Forte adds costus, senna and fennel to TaibUVID. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews confirmed evidence-based therapeutic benefits of TaibUVID components in treating many human diseases e.g. diabetes mellitus and hypertension, common co-morbidities in COVID-19 patients. Double-blind clinical trials for treating COVID-19 patients with TaibUVID supplements were inapplicable. In this retrospective study in Egypt, COVID-19 patients and contacts knew TaibUVID via social media and voluntarily used them. 65% of COVID-19 patients (n = 13) received both pharmacological treatments and adjuvant TaibUVID nutritional supplements. 35% (n = 7) received TaibUVID only. Lymphopenia rapidly improved to lymphocytosis upon regular TaibUVID intake. TaibUVID nutritional supplements helped COVID-19 contacts' prophylaxis. 70% of COVID-19 contacts (n = 14) (on regular TaibUVID intake) did not get SARS-COV2 infection. 30% (n = 6) were not using TaibUVID regularly and got mild flu-like symptoms and upon using both TaibUVID and pharmacological treatments, all improved and got negative nasopharyngeal swabs PCR. COVID-19 contacts were mainly physicians (40%, n = 8) (dealing with COVID-19 patients daily) and members of physicians' families (45%). Main presentations reported by COVID-19 patients (n = 20) were cough (90%), fever (55%), anosmia (45%), taste loss (45%), sore throat (45%), respiratory difficulty (45%) and malaise (35%). TaibUVID inhalation therapy (nigella sativa/anthemis/costus solution nebulization) was used by 65% of COVID-19 patients (n = 13) and alleviated respiratory manifestations e.g. cough and respiratory difficulty and was life-saving in some cases. 70% of COVID-19 patients (n = 14) improved in 1-4 days, 25% (n = 5) improved in 5-10 days while 5% improved in more than 10 days. TaibUVID nutritional supplements were tolerable and significantly satisfactory (P<0.01). 81.25% of COVID-19 patients (n = 13) did not report side effects. 18.25% (n = 3) reported mild diarrhea, sweating and hyperglycemia (not confirmed to be due to TaibUVID supplements). 31.25% of patients (n = 5) were satisfied by 100% with TaibUVID nutritional supplements. 37.5% (n = 6) of patients were satisfied by 75%. In conclusion, TaibUVID nutritional supplements are recommended for public prophylaxis (to decrease emergence of new cases) and treatment in COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical trials and further investigations are recommended.","El Sayed, Salah Mohamed; Aboonq, Moutasem Salih; El Rashedy, Amr Gamal; Aljehani, Yasmeen Talal; Abou El-Magd, Rabab M; Okashah, Ahmed M; El-Anzi, Mariam E; Alharbi, Mansour Barakah; El-Tahlawi, Rehab; Nabo, Manal Mohamed Helmy; Yousef, Reda S; Elshazley, Momen; Abu-Elnaga, Mostafa; Mahmoud, Hany Salah; El-Alaf, Hassan; Abdelrahman, Abdelrahman Ibrahim; Abdel-Gawad, Abdelhady Ragab; Soliman, Tamer M",Am J Blood Res,,571

However, Taq polymerase belongs to the same DNA polymerase superfamily as the Molony murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and has in the past been shown to possess reverse transcriptase activity. We report optimized buffer and salt compositions that promote the reverse transcriptase activity of Taq DNA polymerase and thereby allow it to be used as the sole enzyme in TaqMan RT-qPCRs. We demonstrate the utility of Taq-alone RT-qPCRs by executing CDC SARS-CoV-2 N1, N2, and N3 TaqMan RT-qPCR assays that could detect as few as 2 copies/µL of input viral genomic RNA.","Bhadra, Sanchita; Maranhao, Andre C; Paik, Inyup; Ellington, Andrew D",Biochemistry,,571

Screening low risk pregnancies for critical congenital heart disease has typically been a shared responsibility by pediatric cardiologists, obstetricians, and maternal fetal medicine (MFM). Currently, many of the fetal echocardiograms for low risk pregnancies for critical congenital heart disease have been deferred or cancelled with the emphasis on suspected abnormalities by MFMs and obstetricians. In this review, we discuss the literature that has been the basis of screening of low risk pregnancies by pediatric cardiologists.

322133,COVID-19 Brings Changes to NP Scope of Practice,2020,"BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 or nCoV has caused countries all over the world to impose lockdowns and undertake stringent preventive measures. This new positive-sense single-stranded RNA strain of coronavirus spreads through droplets of saliva and nasal discharge. PURPOSE: US FDA has authorized the emergency use of Remdesivir looking at the increasing number of cases of COVID-19, however there is still no drug approved to treat COVID-19. An alternative way of treatment could be the use of naturally derived molecules with known antiviral properties. METHOD: We reviewed the antiviral activities of two polyphenols derived from tea, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) from green tea and theaflavins from black tea. Both green tea and black tea polyphenols have been reported to exhibit antiviral activities against various viruses, especially positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. RESULTS: Recent studies have revealed the possible binding sites present on SARS-CoV-2 and studied their interactions with tea polyphenols. EGCG and theaflavins, especially theaflavin-3,3'-digallate (TF3) have shown a significant interaction with the receptors under consideration in this review. Some docking studies further emphasize on the activity of these polyphenols against COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This review summarizes the available reports and evidences which support the use of tea polyphenols as potential candidates in prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19.","Mhatre, Susmit; Srivastava, Tishya; Naik, Shivraj; Patravale, Vandana",Phytomedicine,,571

322538,Covid-19 and Early Global Decarceration Trends,2020,"For controlling recent COVID-19 outbreaks around the world, many countries have implemented suppression and mitigation interventions. This work aims to conduct a feasibility study for accessing the effect of multiple interventions to control the COVID-19 breakouts in the UK and other European countries, accounting for balance of healthcare demand. The model is to infer the impact of mitigation, suppression and multiple rolling interventions for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK, with two features considered: direct link between exposed and recovered population, and practical healthcare demand by separation of infections. We combined the calibrated model with COVID-19 data in London and non-London regions in the UK during February and April 2020. Our finding suggests that rolling intervention is an optimal strategy to effectively control COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK for balancing healthcare demand and morality ratio. It is better to implement regional based interventions with varied intensities and maintenance periods. We suggest an intervention strategy named as ""Besieged and rolling interventions"" to the UK that take a consistent suppression in London for 100 days and 3 weeks rolling intervention in other regions. This strategy would reduce the overall infections and deaths of COVID-19 outbreaks, and balance healthcare demand in the UK.","Yang, Po; Yang, Geng; Qi, Jun; Sheng, Bin; Yang, Yun; Zhang, Shuhao; Bi, Gaoshan; Mao, Xuxin",Sci Rep,,571

If most of clinical presentations are benign, fragile patients are at greater risk of developing severe or fatal lung disease. Many therapies have been explored with very low impact on mortality. In this context, Kirkby et Mackenzie have published in April 2020 a report reminding the anti-inflammatory properties of low-dose radiotherapy (delivering less than 1Gy) and its use in the treatment of viral and bacterial pneumopathies before antibiotics era. Large in vivo and in vitro data have demonstrated the biological rationale and anti-inflammatory activity of low-dose radiotherapy in many pathologies. Over the past year, three phase I/II clinical trials have been published, as well as one randomized controlled trial, reporting the feasibility and the clinical and biological improvement of a 0.5 to 1Gy treatment dose to the entire lung. 13 other studies, including a randomized phase III trial, are currently ongoing worldwide. These studies may provide data in the effect of low-dose radiotherapy in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. This article explains biological rationale of low-dose radiotherapy, and reports already published or ongoing studies on low-dose radiotherapy for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.","Miran, C; Bonnet, É; Allignet, B; Clippe, S; El Hedi Zouai, M; Bosset, M; Fleury, B; Guy, J-B",Cancer radiother,,571

322926,Enhancing the indicator for covid-19 confirmed cases,2020,"Computer-aided radiological image interpretation systems can be helpful to reshape the overall workflow of the COVID-19 diagnosis process. This article describes an unsupervised CT scan image segmentation approach. This approach begins by performing a morphological reconstruction operation that is useful to remove the effect of the external disturbances on the infected regions and to locate different regions of interest precisely. The optimal size of the structuring element is selected using the Edge Content-based contrast matrix approach. After performing the opening by using the morphological reconstruction operation, further noise is eliminated using the closing-based morphological reconstruction operation. The original pixel space is restored and the obtained image is divided into some non-overlapping smaller blocks and the mean intensity value for each block is computed that is used as the local threshold value for the binarization purpose. It is preferable to manually determine the range of the infected region. If a region is greater than the upper bound then that region will be considered as an exceptional region and processed separately. Three standard metrics MSE, PSNR, and SSIM are used to quantify the outcomes. Both quantitative and qualitative comparisons prove the efficiency and real-life adaptability of this approach. The proposed approach is evaluated with the help of 400 different images and on average, the proposed approach achieves MSE 307.1888625, PSNR 23.7246505, and SSIM 0.831718459.

Before COVID-19, millions of Americans lacked access to mental health resources, and now in the midst of a global pandemic, resources are more limited in times of greater need. In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided funding for mental health reforms; yet many barriers remained to receiving sufficient care. In February 2021, the Society of Behavioral Medicine recommended federal legislators expand Community Behavioral Healthcare Centers, increase funding for Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers and School Based Health Centers, incentivize providers to accept Medicaid, and institute more statewide licensing flexibilities to expand the reach of mental health care. In March 2021, the American Rescue Plan was signed into law and provided an additional ~$4 billion in funding for community mental health services, implementing substance abuse prevention and treatment programs, increasing the behavioral health workforce, promoting behavioral telehealth within primary care, increasing school-based mental health services, implementing suicide prevention programs, and improving services for traumatized families. This significant investment in parents and children's mental health is a tremendous step in the right direction and provides reassurance that relief is underway. Ongoing surveillance of the programmatic and clinical outcomes that result from these new policy reforms will be important for identifying areas that may need continual support as our nation recovers from COVID-19.","Bean, Melanie K; Adams, Elizabeth L; Buscemi, Joanna; Ford, Sabrina; Wischenka, Danielle; Behrman, Pam; Wilson, Dawn K; Gladstone, Tracy R G; Fitzgibbon, Marian L",Translational behavioral medicine (Internet),,571

325458,Healthcare Facilities: Preparing for Community Transmission,2020,"COVID-19 or novel coronavirus disease, which has already been declared as a worldwide pandemic, at first had an outbreak in a large city of China, named Wuhan. More than two hundred countries around the world have already been affected by this severe virus as it spreads by human interaction. Moreover, the symptoms of novel coronavirus are quite similar to the general seasonal flu. Screening of infected patients is considered as a critical step in the fight against COVID-19. As there are no distinctive COVID-19 positive case detection tools available, the need for supporting diagnostic tools has increased. Therefore, it is highly relevant to recognize positive cases as early as possible to avoid further spreading of this epidemic. However, there are several methods to detect COVID-19 positive patients, which are typically performed based on respiratory samples and among them, a critical approach for treatment is radiologic imaging or X-Ray imaging. Recent findings from X-Ray imaging techniques suggest that such images contain relevant information about the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Application of Deep Neural Network (DNN) techniques coupled with radiological imaging can be helpful in the accurate identification of this disease, and can also be supportive in overcoming the issue of a shortage of trained physicians in remote communities. In this article, we have introduced a VGG-16 (Visual Geometry Group, also called OxfordNet) Network-based Faster Regions with Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster R–CNN) framework to detect COVID-19 patients from chest X-Ray images using an available open-source dataset. Our proposed approach provides a classification accuracy of 97.36%, 97.65% of sensitivity, and a precision of 99.28%. Therefore, we believe this proposed method might be of assistance for health professionals to validate their initial assessment towards COVID-19 patients.","Shibly, Kabid Hassan; Dey, Samrat Kumar; Islam, Md Tahzib-Ul; Rahman, Md Mahbubur",Inform.

327615,UK still lacks a coherent and clearly articulated covid-19 strategy,2021,"Patients with severe Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) typically require supplemental oxygen as an essential treatment. We developed a machine learning algorithm, based on a deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), for continuous management of oxygen flow rate for critical ill patients under intensive care, which can identify the optimal personalized oxygen flow rate with strong potentials to reduce mortality rate relative to the current clinical practice. Basically, we modeled the oxygen flow trajectory of COVID-19 patients and their health outcomes as a Markov decision process. Based on individual patient characteristics and health status, a reinforcement learning based oxygen control policy is learned and real-time recommends the oxygen flow rate to reduce the mortality rate. We assessed the performance of proposed methods through cross validation by using a retrospective cohort of 1,372 critically ill patients with COVID-19 from New York University Langone Health ambulatory care with electronic health records from April 2020 to January 2021. The mean mortality rate under the RL algorithm is lower than standard of care by 2.57% (95% CI: 2.08- 3.06) reduction (P<0.001) from 7.94% under the standard of care to 5.37 % under our algorithm and the averaged recommended oxygen flow rate is 1.28 L/min (95% CI: 1.14-1.42) lower than the rate actually delivered to patients. Thus, the RL algorithm could potentially lead to better intensive care treatment that can reduce mortality rate, while saving the oxygen scarce resources. It can reduce the oxygen shortage issue and improve public health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zheng, Hua; Zhu, Jiahao; Xie, Wei; Zhong, Judy",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.08923v1.pdf,571

330139,Charting the challenges behind the testing of COVID-19 in developing countries: Nepal as a case study,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that COVID-19 is a pandemic having a higher spread rate rather than the mortality. Identification of a potential approach or therapy against COVID-19 is still under consideration. Therefore, it is essential to have an insight into SARS-CoV-2, its interacting partner, and domains for an effective treatment. The present study is divided into three main categories, including SARS-CoV-2 prominent receptor and its expression levels, other interacting partners, and their binding domains. The first section focuses primarily on coronaviruses' general aspects (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronaviruses (MERS-CoV)) their structures, similarities, and mode of infections. The second section discusses the host receptors which includes the human targets of coronaviruses like dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), CD147, CD209L, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), and other miscellaneous targets (type-II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), furin, trypsin, cathepsins, thermolysin, elastase, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 5-kinase, two-pore segment channel, and epithelium sodium channel C-&#945; subunit). The human cell receptor, ACE2 plays an essential role in the Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS) pathway and COVID-19. Thus, this section also discusses the ACE2 expression and risk of COVID-19 infectivity in various organs and tissues such as the liver, lungs, intestine, heart, and reproductive system in the human body. Absence of ACE2 protein expression in immune cells could be used for limiting the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The third section covers the current available approaches for COVID-19 treatment. Overall, this review focuses on the critical role of human cell receptors involved in coronavirus pathogenesis, which would likely be used in designing target-specific drugs to combat COVID-19.","Raghav, Pawan Kumar; Kalyanaraman, Keerthana; Kumar, Dinesh",Amino Acids,,571

It is valuable for virologists to develop a fast method to rescue infectious virus from a viral cDNA clone. Here, we report a method for rapid rescue of infectious EV71 by using cells expressing T7 polymerase. The full-length EV71 genome was amplified in one step by long-distance PCR with a T7 promoter at the 5' end, and the T7 polymerase gene was cloned into a lentivirus vector for construction of a stable cell line expressing T7 polymerase. The infectious virus was rapidly and efficiently rescued by single transfection of cells with the infectious cDNA clone. Further experiments showed that the rescued virus had characteristics similar to those of the parental virus. This method circumvented the difficulty in performing in vitro transcription of a long linear DNA to obtain high-quality RNA. The construction of the viral cDNA clone and the fast rescue of the infectious virus will greatly benefit future investigations.","Fu, Meixian; Bai, Jinjin; Gao, Shuang; Chang, Zhangmei; Zhou, Xin; Long, Jian-Er",Arch. virol,,571

An essential feature of the new methodology is its universality and comprehensiveness. Thanks to that, it can be applied in such areas as higher education, aviation, automotive, shipbuilding, energy and many others. The paper also identifies the significant advantages and disadvantages of VR-based education that may determine its use scope and profile. In addition, on the basis of the proposed methodology, a model of a training station using VR technology has been developed to enable the realization of training classes in the field of firefighting activities that should be undertaken during the hazard arising from the operation of a numerically controlled production machine. Results of the conducted training using this station were also presented. The study showed the potential of training based on a virtual environment to improve participants’ skills and knowledge.

330549,Provide Volunteers With COVID‐19 Protocols,2021,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, conflicting opinions on physical distancing swept across social media, affecting both human behavior and the spread of COVID-19. Inspired by such phenomena, we construct a two-layer multiplex network for the coupled spread of a disease and conflicting opinions. We model each process as a contagion. On one layer, we consider the concurrent evolution of two opinions -- pro-physical-distancing and anti-physical-distancing -- that compete with each other and have mutual immunity to each other. The disease evolves on the other layer, and individuals are less likely (respectively, more likely) to become infected when they adopt the pro-physical-distancing (respectively, anti-physical-distancing) opinion. We develop approximations of mean-field type by generalizing monolayer pair approximations to multilayer networks; these approximations agree well with Monte Carlo simulations for a broad range of parameters and several network structures. Through numerical simulations, we illustrate the influence of opinion dynamics on the spread of the disease from complex interactions both between the two conflicting opinions and between the opinions and the disease. We find that lengthening the duration that individuals hold an opinion may help suppress disease transmission, and we demonstrate that increasing the cross-layer correlations or intra-layer correlations of node degrees may lead to fewer individuals becoming infected with the disease.","Peng, Kaiyan; Lu, Zheng; Lin, Vanessa; Lindstrom, Michael R.; Parkinson, Christian; Wang, Chuntian; Bertozzi, Andrea L.; Porter, Mason A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.01713v1.pdf,571
330657,Whose life to save? Scarce resources allocation in the COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Transmission of COVID-19 through close contact and droplets is well established, but the influence of aerosol and surface contamination remains to be determined. Literature is scarce and inconsistent about the viable virus particles free-distance from infected patients, as well as about different swabbing methods for surface contamination evaluation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the most sensitive method for the assessment of surface contamination, classify the likelihood of environmental contamination in risk zones and compare the environmental contamination between oxygenation and ventilatory support. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Swabs from potentially contaminated surfaces in a COVID-19 ward, with patients treated with different types of oxygen and ventilatory support, were collected. Three types of swabs were compared in order to evaluate the most sensitive collection method. For risk zone categorization, areas were divided according to the distance from the patient. RESULTS: Of the 63 swabs collected, 17 (27%) tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. The highest positivity rate was observed with the sterile premoistened swab with saline (n = 8; 38%), but without statistically significant differences. The highest number of positive samples were collected from the high-risk zones, specifically those located one meter from the patient (n = 13; 48%), with statistically significant differences. Only the rooms of patients supported with non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula had evidence of bedroom contamination, with 45% and 27% of swab positivity, with statistically significant differences. DISCUSSION: Our findings favour the premoistened swab without transport medium for surface contamination assessment, even though without statistical differences. A statistically significant trend supporting the division in risk zones, according to the distance from the patient, was also identified. The higher positivity rate from the non-invasive ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula bedrooms suggests a significant association between ventilatory strategies and surface contamination, probably due to higher particle dispersion. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the use of the sterile premoistened swab without preservation medium, the classification of risk areas considering the distance from the patient, and the variability of RNA dispersion between oxygenation and ventilatory support.","Mendes, Marta; Andrade Oliveira, Ana; Pires, Olga; Branca, Fernando; Beirão, Maria; Santa-Cruz, André; Carvalho, Alexandre; Alves, Joana",Acta med. port,,571

In the present study, we investigated the effects of MNCs on trustworthiness appraisals, the influence of changes due to MNCs in evaluating joy, and the relationship between a social-cognitive appraisal bias and a participant's characteristics. METHODS: All participants (N = 165) judged the intensity of happiness and trustworthiness in calm facial stimuli presented with and without a surgical mask covering part of the face. We analysed the relationship of changes in judgements evoked by MNCs to participants' evaluations of MNCs as protective tools and explored their associations with the burden experienced by wearing MNCs, compliance to behaviour recommendations, their risk associated with the pandemic, and their levels of psychological distress. RESULTS: Overall, calm facial stimuli covered with MNCs were evaluated as less trustworthy and, to an even stronger extent, less happy than uncovered facial stimuli. However, participants varied in whether they showed a negative or positive evaluation of faces with MNCs; the negative bias was stronger in those participants who attributed lower protective potential to MNCs, experienced a higher burden while wearing MNCs, wore MNCs less often, and experienced a higher level of psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: A negative bias in trustworthiness appraisals of faces with a positive emotional expression covered by MNCs is linked to a participant's evaluation of MNCs as inefficient and burdening and their experience of high psychological distress.","Biermann, Miriam; Schulze, Anna; Unterseher, Franziska; Atanasova, Konstantina; Watermann, Paulina; Krause-Utz, Annegret; Stahlberg, Dagmar; Bohus, Martin; Lis, Stefanie",PLoS One,,571

Identifying animal species susceptible to infection with the SARS-CoV-2/ HCoV-19 pathogen is essential for controlling the outbreak and for testing valid prophylactics or therapeutics based on animal model studies. Here, different aged Chinese tree shrews (adult group, 1 year old; old group, 5-6 years old), which are close relatives to primates, were infected with SARS-CoV-2. X-ray, viral shedding, laboratory, and histological analyses were performed on different days post-inoculation (dpi). Results showed that Chinese tree shrews could be infected by SARS-CoV-2. Lung infiltrates were visible in X-ray radiographs in most infected animals. Viral RNA was consistently detected in lung tissues from infected animals at 3, 5, and 7 dpi, along with alterations in related parameters from routine blood tests and serum biochemistry, including increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Histological analysis of lung tissues from animals at 3 dpi (adult group) and 7 dpi (old group) showed thickened alveolar septa and interstitial hemorrhage. Several differences were found between the two different aged groups in regard to viral shedding peak. Our results indicate that Chinese tree shrews have the potential to be used as animal models for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Xu, Ling; Yu, Dan-Dan; Ma, Yu-Hua; Yao, Yu-Lin; Luo, Rong-Hua; Feng, Xiao-Li; Cai, Hou-Rong; Han, Jian-Bao; Wang, Xue-Hui; Li, Ming-Hua; Ke, Chang-Wen; Zheng, Yong-Tang; Yao, Yong-Gang",Zool Res,,571

332091,Estimation of COVID-19 prevalence from serology tests: a partial identification approach. (Special Issue: Pandemic econometrics.),2021,"PURPOSE: Health care priorities of individuals may change during a pandemic, which may, in turn, affect health services utilization. We examined Canadians' online relative search interest in five common solid tumors (breast, colon, lung, prostate, and thyroid) during the COVID-19 pandemic to that observed in the same months in the prior 5 years. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional retrospective study using Google Trends aggregate anonymous online search data from Canada. We compared the respective relative search volumes for breast, colon, lung, prostate, and thyroid cancers for the months March-November 2020 with the mean for the same months in 2015-2019. Welch's two-sample t tests were performed and the raw P values were then adjusted using Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to correct for multiple comparisons. The level of statistical significance was defined by choosing false discovery rate at .05 for the primary analysis. RESULTS: We observed temporary statistically significant reductions in Canadians' relative search volumes for various cancers, largely early in the pandemic, in the spring of 2020. Specifically, significant reductions (after adjustment for multiple comparisons) were observed for breast cancer in April, May, and October 2020; colon cancer in March and April of 2020; lung cancer in April and September 2020; and prostate cancer in April and May 2020. Thyroid cancer relative search volumes were not significantly different from those observed prior to the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Although Canadians' online interest in various cancers temporarily waned early in the COVID-19 pandemic, recent relative search volumes for various cancers are largely not significantly different from prior to the pandemic.","Xu, Ruoyong; Brown, Patrick; Baxter, Nancy; Sawka, Anna M",JCO Clin Cancer Inform,,571
332097,Covid-19: How will a waiver on vaccine patents affect global supply?,2021,"Equine infectious disease outbreaks may have profound economic impact, resulting in losses of millions of dollars of revenue as a result of horse loss, quarantine, and cancelled events. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential to limit the spread of infectious diseases. However, laboratory detection of infectious agents, especially the simultaneous detection of multiple agents, can be challenging to the clinician and diagnostic laboratory. Next-generation sequencing (NGS), which allows millions of DNA templates to be sequenced simultaneously in a single reaction, is an ideal technology for comprehensive testing. We conducted a proof-of-concept study of targeted NGS to detect 62 common equine bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens in clinical samples. We designed 264 primers and constructed a bioinformatics tool for the detection of targeted pathogens. The designed primers were able to specifically detect the intended pathogens. Results of testing 27 clinical samples with our targeted NGS assay compared with results of routine tests (assessed as a group) yielded positive percent agreement of 81% and negative percent agreement of 83%, overall agreement of 81%, and kappa of 0.56 (moderate agreement). This moderate agreement was likely the result of low sensitivity of some primers. However, our NGS assay successfully detected multiple pathogens in the clinical samples, including some pathogens missed by routine techniques.","Anis, Eman; Ilha, Marcia R S; Engiles, Julie B; Wilkes, Rebecca P",J Vet Diagn Invest,,571

333669,Accelerated vaccine rollout is imperative to mitigate highly transmissible COVID-19 variants,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Although clinical presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 has been extensively described, immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 remains yet not fully understood. Similarities with bacterial sepsis were observed; however, few studies specifically addressed differences of immune response between both conditions. Here, we report a longitudinal analysis of the immune response in coronavirus disease 2019 patients, its correlation with outcome, and comparison between severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients and septic patients. DESIGN: Longitudinal, retrospective observational study. SETTING: Tertiary-care hospital during the first 2020 coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in France. PATIENTS: All successive patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection admitted to the emergency department, medical ward, and ICU with at least one available immunophenotyping performed during hospital stay. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Between March and April 2020, 247 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 were included and compared with a historical cohort of 108 severe septic patients. Nonsevere coronavirus disease 2019 patients (n = 153) presented normal or slightly altered immune profiles. Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (n = 94) immune profile differed from sepsis. Coronavirus disease 2019 exhibited profound and prolonged lymphopenia (mostly on CD3, CD4, CD8, and NK cells), neutrophilia, and human leukocyte antigen D receptor expression on CD14+ monocytes down-regulation. Surprisingly, coronavirus disease 2019 patients presented a unique profile of B cells expansion, basophilia, and eosinophilia. Lymphopenia, human leukocyte antigen D receptor expression on CD14+ monocytes down-regulation, and neutrophilia were associated with a worsened outcome, whereas basophilia and eosinophilia were associated with survival. Circulating immune cell kinetics differed between severe coronavirus disease 2019 and sepsis, lack of correction of immune alterations in coronavirus disease 2019 patients during the first 2 weeks of ICU admission was associated with death and nosocomial infections. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating immune cells profile differs between mild and severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Severe coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with a unique immune profile as compared with sepsis. Several immune features are associated with outcome. Thus, immune monitoring of coronavirus disease 2019 might be of help for patient management.","de Roquetaillade, Charles; Mansouri, Sehmi; Brumpt, Caren; Neuwirth, Marie; Voicu, Sebastian; Le Dorze, Matthieu; Fontaine, Candice; Barthelemy, Romain; Gayat, Etienne; Megarbane, Bruno; Mebazaa, Alexandre; Chousterman, Benjamin Glenn",Crit. care med,,571
334133,COVID-19 Diagnosis Based Android Mobile Application Using Certainty Factor Method,2020,"December 2019 saw a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from China quickly spread globally. Currently, COVID-19, defined as the new pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), has reached over 750,000 confirmed cases worldwide. The virus began to spread in Italy from the 22nd February, and the number of related cases is still increasing. Furthermore, given that a relevant proportion of infected people need hospitalization in Intensive Care Units, this may be a crucial issue for National Healthcare System's capacity. WHO underlines the importance of specific disease regional estimates. Because of this, Italy aimed to put in place proportioned and controlled measures, and to guarantee adequate funding to both increase the number of ICU beds and increase production of personal protective equipment. Our aim is to investigate the current COVID-19 epidemiological context in Sardinia region (Italy) and to estimate the transmission parameters using a stochastic model to establish the number of infected, recovered, and deceased people expected. Based on available data from official Italian and regional sources, we describe the distribution of infected cases during the period between 2nd and 15th March 2020. To better reflect the actual spread of COVID-19 in Sardinia based on data from 15th March (first Sardinian declared outbreak), two Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) models have been developed, describing the best and worst scenarios. We believe that our findings represent a valid contribution to better understand the epidemiological context of COVID-19 in Sardinia. Our analysis can help health authorities and policymakers to address the right interventions to deal with the rapidly expanding health emergency.","Puci, Mariangela Valentina; Loi, Federica; Ferraro, Ottavia Eleonora; Cappai, Stefano; Rolesu, Sandro; Montomoli, Cristina",Front.

335302,Patient oriented research in mental health: matching laboratory to life and beyond in Canada,2021,"Despite continued advances and developments in neonatal medicine, neonatal sepsis is the third leading cause of neonatal mortality and a major public health problem, especially in developing countries. Sepsis accounts for mortality for almost 50% of global children under 5 years of age.Over the past 50 years, there have been many advances in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of neonatal infections. The diagnostic advances include better culture techniques that permit more rapid confirmation of the diagnosis, advent of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to rapidly diagnose viral infections, use of biologic markers indicating evidence of infection, and a better understanding of immunoglobulin markers of infection. From a therapeutic stand point, there have been a variety of antibiotics, antifungals, and antiviral agents, better approaches to prevent sepsis, specific immunotherapy, for example, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); bundled approach to prevention of deep-line infection and better antibiotic stewardship, leading to earlier discontinuation of antibiotic therapy.Hand hygiene remains the benchmark and gold standard for late-onset sepsis prevention. The challenge has been that each decade, newer resistant bacteria dominate as the cause of sepsis and newer viruses emerge, for example, human immunodeficiency virus, zika virus, and novel coronavirus disease 2019.Future treatment options might include stem cell therapy, other antimicrobial protein and peptides, and targeting of pattern recognition receptors in an effort to prevent and/or treat sepsis in this vulnerable population. Also, the microbiome of premature infants has a smaller proportion of beneficial bacteria and higher numbers of pathogenic bacteria compared with term infants, likely owing to higher frequencies of cesarean sections, antibiotic use, exposure to the hospital environment, and feeding nonhuman milk products. Modifying the microbiome with more mother's milk and shorter duration of antibiotics in noninfected babies should be a goal. KEY POINTS: · Neonatal sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality.. · Challenges include bacterial resistance and newer viruses.. · Future treatments may include newer antibiotics/antivirals and stem cell therapy..","Fanaroff, Avroy A; Fanaroff, Jonathan M",Am J Perinatol,,571

335550,Human Challenge Trials: Ethical and Legal Issues for COVID-19 Research,2021,"Background: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic presents a global crisis. To remain safe, individuals must take preventive measures. Health behavior theories suggest that perceived risk is a key determinant of engagement in preventive behavior. People often underestimate their risk for disease compared with similar others’, a phenomenon known as optimistic bias (OB). Objective: This study aimed to explore how OB affected individuals' engagement in COVID-19 preventive behavior/intentions. Based on health behavior theories, this study considered risk perception and risk response as mediators of the relationship between OB and individuals’ preventive health behaviors and intentions. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional survey design. Online survey platforms were used to recruit U.S. adults. A total of 293 valid responses were included in the analyses. Multivariate regression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship of OB to the respondents’ health information seeking intention and related behavioral outcomes. Results: Results from the first regression model showed that OB was negatively related to risk perception. In other words, optimistically biased respondents perceived their risk of COVID-19 to be low. The second model demonstrated that perceived risk was related positively to affective responses to risk (e.g., worry and fear). That is, the lower their perceived risk of COVID-19, the less likely respondents were to feel anxiety and fear about this disease. Models 3 and 4 revealed positive relationships between risk response and respondents’ intentions and behaviors. Finally, the results supported a fully mediated pathway: OB → risk perception → risk response → information seeking intention and behavioral outcomes. Conclusions: The study findings suggest that by decreasing their perceived risk and subsequent responses, optimistic bias can undermine individuals’ motivation to take precautions. To reduce this bias, the actual risk of COVID-19 should be reinforced.","Park, Taehwan; Ju, Ilwoo; Ohs, Jennifer E.; Hinsley, Amber",Res. Soc. Adm. Pharm.,,571

Until more data are available, the focus needs to center on principles of critical care nutrition modified for the constraints of this disease process, i.e., COVID-19-relevant recommendations. Delivery of nutritional therapy must include strategies to reduce exposure and spread of the disease by providing clustered care, adequate protection of healthcare providers, and preservation of personal protective equipment. Enteral nutrition (EN) should be initiated early after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) using a standard isosmolar polymeric formula, starting at trophic doses and advancing as tolerated while monitoring for gastrointestinal intolerance, hemodynamic instability, and metabolic derangements. Intragastric EN may be provided safely, even with use of prone positioning and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Clinicians, though, should have a lower threshold for switching to parenteral nutrition in cases of intolerance, high risk of aspiration, or escalating vasopressor support. While data extrapolated from experience in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) warrants use of fiber additives and probiotic organisms. The lack of demonstrated benefit precludes a recommendation for micronutrient supplementation. Practices which increase exposure or contamination of equipment, such as use of gastric residual volumes as a monitor, indirect calorimetry to calculate requirements, endoscopy or fluoroscopy to achieve enteral access, or transport out of the ICU for additional imaging should be avoided. At all times, strategies for nutritional therapy need to be assessed on a risk/benefit basis, paying attention to risk for both the patient and the healthcare provider.

The patients' medical charts were reviewed for the presence of GI symptoms at admission, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms (cases) were compared with COVID-19 patients without GI symptoms (control). RESULTS: A total of 150 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were included, of which 31 (20.6%) patients had at least 1 or more of the GI symptoms (cases). They were compared with the 119 COVID-19 patients without GI symptoms (controls). The average age among cases was 57.6 years (SD 17.2) and control was 63.3 years (SD 14.6). No statistically significant difference was noted in comorbidities and laboratory findings. The primary outcome was mortality, which did not differ between cases and controls (41.9 vs. 37.8%, p = 0.68). No statistically significant differences were noted in secondary outcomes, including the length of stay (LOS, 7.8 vs. 7.9 days, p = 0.87) and need for mechanical ventilation (29 vs. 26.9%, p = 0.82). DISCUSSION: In our study, the presence of GI manifestations in COVID-19 at the time of admission was not associated with increased mortality, LOS, or mechanical ventilation.","Ramachandran, Preethi; Onukogu, Ifeanyichkwu; Ghanta, Snigdha; Gajendran, Mahesh; Perisetti, Abhilash; Goyal, Hemant; Aggarwal, Alok",Dig Dis,,571

337734,COVID-19: The worst date to the senior dance,2020,"BACKGROUND: Telehealth modalities were introduced during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to assure continuation of cancer care and maintain social distance. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort analysis of our telehealth expansion programme. We adapted two existing patient-reported outcome (PRO) telemonitoring tools that register and (self-)manage toxicities to therapy, while screening for SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms. Outpatients from a tertiary cancer centre were enrolled. The adapted PRO interface allowed for uniform registration of SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms and effective triage of patients at home where we also implemented systematic throat washings, when available. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty patients registered to the telemonitoring systems from March 13 to May 15, 2020. Four prespecified SARS-CoV-2 alarms resulted in three patients with positive PCR testing. Other Covid-19 symptoms (fever 5× and cough 2×) led to pretreatment triage resulting in 1 seroconversion after initial negative testing. One of the 477 throat washings proved positive. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid adoption of an amended PRO (self-)registrations and toxicity management system was feasible and coordinated screening for Covid-19. Continued clinical cancer care was maintained, with significant decreased waiting time. The systemic screening with throat washings offered no real improvement.","Rasschaert, Marika; Vanclooster, Pieterjan; Mertens, Tim; Roelant, Ella; Lesage, Katrien; Prenen, Hans; Verlinden, Anke; van Brussel, Ilse; Ravelingien, Jo; Janssens, Annelies; Van Dam, Peter; Peeters, Marc",Br J Cancer,,571

Therefore, the transition to emergency remote teaching in April 2020 in response to COVID-19 was particularly challenging. This paper describes how the teaching staff in one English as a Foreign Language (EFL) department at a national university in Japan came together to support one another with various online guides and the creation of peer support groups. This activity is analysed in terms of the development of an Ecology of Resources (EoR) (Luckin, 2008) and an online Community of Practice (Lave & Wenger, 1991). The four collaborative documents and the peer support group that make up the EoR are described together with examples of this teacher development process. By partaking in the creation of the EoR teaching staff learned together how to teach online in an emergency context and this collaboration can be the basis for future online teaching in an institution where it had not happened before.","Cowie, N.",Ijeri-International Journal of Educational Research and Innovation,,571

339656,How can the scientific community ensure the integrity of COVID-19 research?,2020,"ackground: There have been few studies evaluating the costs of palliative care (PC) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), especially for patients with cancer. Objectives: The objective of this study was to identify the sociodemographic and clinical variables that could explain the cost per day of PC for cancer in Brazil. Methods: This was a retrospective cost analysis of PC at a quaternary cancer center in São Paulo, Brazil, between January 2010 and December 2013. Factors influencing the cost per day were assessed with generalized linear models and generalized linear-mixed models in which the random effect was the site of the cancer. Results: The study included 2985 patients. The mean total cost per patient was $12,335 (standard deviation [SD] = 14,602; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 11,803 to 12,851). The mean cost per day per patient was $325.50 (SD = 246.30, 95% CI = 316.60 to 334.30). There were statistically significant differences among cancer sites in terms of the mean cost per day. Multivariate analysis revealed that the drivers of cost per day were Karnofsky performance status, the number of hospital admissions, referral to PC, and place of death. Place of death had the greatest impact on the cost per day; death in a hospital and in hospice care increased the mean cost per day by $1.56 and $1.83, respectively. Conclusion: To allocate resources effectively, PC centers in LMICs should emphasize early enrollment of patients at PC outpatient clinics, to avoid hospital readmission, as well as advance planning of the place of death.","Rozman, Luciana Martins; Gonçalves, Campolina.

COVID-19 predisposes patients to a hypercoagulable state, however, the pathophysiology behind the thrombotic complications seen in this disease is not well understood. Several mechanisms have been proposed and the pathogenesis likely involves a host immune response contributing to vascular endothelial cell injury, inflammation, activation of the coagulation cascade via tissue factor expression, and shutdown of fibrinolysis. Treatments targeting these pathways may need to be considered to improve clinical outcomes and decrease overall mortality due to thrombotic complications. In this review, we will discuss the proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms for thrombotic complications in COVID-19, as well as treatment strategies for these complications based on the current literature available.","Kichloo, Asim; Dettloff, Kirk; Aljadah, Michael; Albosta, Michael; Jamal, Shakeel; Singh, Jagmeet; Wani, Farah; Kumar, Akshay; Vallabhaneni, Srilakshmi; Khan, Muhammad Zia",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,,571

The results of these extreme therapeutic efforts have been sobering. Further, we are months away from a robust vaccination effort, and current therapies provide limited clinical relief. Therefore, several empirical oxygenation support initiatives have been initiated with intermittent hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy to overcome the unrelenting and progressive hypoxemia during maximum ventilator support in intubated patients, despite high FiO2. Overall, few patients have been successfully treated in different locations across the globe. More recently, less severe patients at the edge of impending hypoxemia were exposed to HBO preventing intubation and obtaining the rapid resolution of symptoms. The few case descriptions indicate large variability in protocols and exposure frequency. This summary illustrates the biological mechanisms of action of increased O2 pressure, hoping to clarify more appropriate protocols and more useful application of HBO in COVID-19 treatment.","Paganini, Matteo; Bosco, Gerardo; Perozzo, Filippo A G; Kohlscheen, Eva; Sonda, Regina; Bassetto, Franco; Garetto, Giacomo; Camporesi, Enrico M; Thom, Stephen R",Adv. exp. med. biol,,571

Many are faced with increased stress, and other negative effects on their mental health. They are also faced with the possibility of infection and death from COVID-19. Before the pandemic there was a global shortage of nurses, but this is likely to be exacerbated by the increased demands of caring during COVID-19 as well as the usual care of non-COVID patients. One serious concern is that the pandemic and multitudinous effects on the nursing profession will exacerbate nursing attrition and their poor mental health into the future. Another serious concern is whether the profession will be able to attract sufficient numbers of nurses to care for populations into the future. Governments and health policymakers everywhere need to invest in nursing and health care and pay attention to the needs of health systems to ensure a healthy population.

A handful of static structures now provide molecular insights into how SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV interact with its host target, which is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Molecular recognition, binding and function are dynamic processes. To evaluate this, multiple 500 ns or 1 µs all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were performed to better understand the structural stability and interfacial interactions between the receptor binding domain of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bound to ACE2. Several contacts were observed to form, break and reform in the interface during the simulations. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV utilizes unique strategies to achieve stable binding to ACE2. Several differences were observed between the residues of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV that consistently interacted with ACE2. Notably, a stable salt bridge between Lys417 of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and Asp30 of ACE2 as well as three stable hydrogen bonds between Tyr449, Gln493 and Gln498 of SARS-CoV-2 and Asp38, Glu35 and Lys353 of ACE2 were observed, which were absent in the ACE2-SARS-CoV interface. Some previously reported residues, which were suggested to enhance the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2, were not observed to form stable interactions in these simulations. Molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area based free energy of binding was observed to be higher for SARS-CoV-2 in all simulations. Stable binding to the host receptor is crucial for virus entry. Therefore, special consideration should be given to these stable interactions while designing potential drugs and treatment modalities to target or disrupt this interface.","Ali, Amanat; Vijayan, Ranjit",Sci Rep,,571

To allow textile manufacturers producing surgical masks to avoid usual restrictions imposed on personal-protective-equipment producers, the Italian government issued a ministerial decree that was followed by technical guidelines provided by several universities. Starting from a hypothetical composition and design, we calculated the carbon footprint of surgical masks manufactured following technical guidelines, with the city of Taranto hosting the production facility. Results show that the production of textile sheets composing the masks and their disposal were the main contributors to emissions, followed by packaging and transportation. A strategy of reuse based on laundry operation was modelled, and the balance between disposal strategy and reuse with the laundry operation (which has environmental issues due to detergents and water use) was in favor of the second option. To reduce the carbon footprint, a minimized textiles area (by smart shaping) and reuse strategies result in the best options. Further reduction may be achieved by building up a recycling chain of disposed masks, activated by municipalities.","Giungato, Pasquale Rana Roberto Leonardo Nitti Nicole Cavallari Cosima Tricase Caterina",Sustainability,,571

The RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) value is inversely correlated with viral load and culturable virus. Here, we investigated differences in RT-qPCR Ct values across Qatars national cohorts of primary infections, reinfections, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) breakthrough infections, and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) breakthrough infections. Through matched-cohort analyses of the randomly diagnosed infections, the mean Ct value was higher in all cohorts of breakthrough infections compared to the cohort of primary infections in unvaccinated individuals.

The objective of the study is to compare the two approaches (extraoral and intraoral) of GNB in patients of carcinoma of the tongue in terms of efficacy, duration, and complications. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective comparative randomized study over a period of 1 year. Fifty patients of either sex of ASA physical status and 2, between 21 and 70 years of age, suffering from carcinoma of the tongue, were selected. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group I received 4 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine combined with 40 mg, of triamcinolonacetonide by extraoral approach of GNB, and Group II received the same amount of drug by intraoral approach of GNB. Hemodynamic parameters, degree of pain relief using visual analog scale (VAS), number of attempts, effect on quality of life (QOL), and complication were noted during the performance of GNB. Results: Demographic profile in both groups was comparable. Rate of complication and number of attempts to complete intervention were higher in Group I, which was found to be statistically significant. However, mean VAS scores in Group I were significantly higher as compared to those in Group II during most of the study period starting from the 1st follow-up at 30 min to the 2nd month postintervention (P < 0.05). No statistically significant difference in mean QOL scores of two groups was observed for the entire study period except at 1 week when mean scores in Group I were higher as compared to those in Group II (P = 0.011). Conclusion: The intraoral approach of GNB was better with respect to pain control and improvement in QOL whereas the rate of complication and number of attempts was lower in extraoral approach of GNB.","Singh, Neetu; Singh, Sarita; Mishra, Neel Kamal; Kumar, Vijay; Gautam, Shefali",J Cancer Res Ther,,571

To examine the full-spectrum of CD8+ T cell immunity in COVID-19, we experimentally evaluated 3141 major histocompatibility (MHC) class I-binding peptides covering the complete SARS-CoV-2 genome. Using DNA-barcoded peptide-MHC complex (pMHC) multimers combined with a T cell phenotype panel, we report a comprehensive list of 122 immunogenic and a subset of immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes. Substantial CD8+ T cell recognition was observed in COVID-19 patients, with up to 27% of all CD8+ lymphocytes interacting with SARS-CoV-2-derived epitopes. Most immunogenic regions were derived from open reading frame (ORF) 1 and ORF3, with ORF1 containing most of the immunodominant epitopes. CD8+ T cell recognition of lower affinity was also observed in healthy donors toward SARS-CoV-2-derived epitopes. This pre-existing T cell recognition signature was partially overlapping with the epitope landscape observed in COVID-19 patients and may drive the further expansion of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly the phenotype of the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells, revealed a strong T cell activation in COVID-19 patients, while minimal T cell activation was seen in healthy individuals. We found that patients with severe disease displayed significantly larger SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell populations compared to patients with mild diseases and these T cells displayed a robust activation profile. These results further our understanding of T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection and hypothesize that strong antigen-specific T cell responses are associated with different disease outcomes.","Saini, Sunil Kumar; Hersby, Ditte Stampe; Tamhane, Tripti; Povlsen, Helle Rus; Amaya Hernandez, Susana Patricia; Nielsen, Morten; Gang, Anne Ortved; Hadrup, Sine Reker",Sci. immunol,,571

343392,Covid-19: volunteers cannot be outsourced,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers and health authorities have sought to identify the different parameters that drive its local transmission cycles to make better decisions regarding prevention and control measures. Different modeling approaches have been proposed in an attempt to predict the behavior of these local cycles. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a framework to characterize the different variables that drive the local, or epidemic, cycles of the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to provide a set of relatively simple, yet efficient, statistical tools to be used by local health authorities to support decision making. METHODS: Virtually closed cycles were compared to cycles in progress from different locations that present similar patterns in the figures that describe them. With the aim to compare populations of different sizes at different periods of time and locations, the cycles were normalized, allowing an analysis based on the core behavior of the numerical series. A model for the reproduction number was derived from the experimental data, and its performance was presented, including the effect of subnotification (ie, underreporting). A variation of the logistic model was used together with an innovative inventory model to calculate the actual number of infected persons, analyze the incubation period, and determine the actual onset of local epidemic cycles. RESULTS: The similarities among cycles were demonstrated. A pattern between the cycles studied, which took on a triangular shape, was identified and used to make predictions about the duration of future cycles. Analyses on effective reproduction number (R(t)) and subnotification effects for Germany, Italy, and Sweden were presented to show the performance of the framework introduced here. After comparing data from the three countries, it was possible to determine the probable dates of the actual onset of the epidemic cycles for each country, the typical duration of the incubation period for the disease, and the total number of infected persons during each cycle. In general terms, a probable average incubation time of 5 days was found, and the method used here was able to estimate the end of the cycles up to 34 days in advance, while demonstrating that the impact of the subnotification level (ie, error) on the effective reproduction number was &lt;5%. CONCLUSIONS: It was demonstrated that, with relatively simple mathematical tools, it is possible to obtain a reliable understanding of the behavior of COVID-19 local epidemic cycles, by introducing an integrated framework for identifying cycle patterns and calculating the variables that drive it, namely: the R(t), the subnotification effects on estimations, the most probable actual cycles start dates, the total number of infected, and the most likely incubation period for SARS-CoV-2.","De Carvalho, E.

We report the management of a national CCP collection and distribution program in Israel. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1 April 2020 to 15 January 2021, 4020 volunteer donors donated 5221 CCP units and 837 (20.8%) donors donated more than once. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG antibodies were determined using chemiluminescent immunoassay method (Abbott). A statistical model based on repeated IgG tests in sequential donations was created to predict the time of antibody decline below sample/cut-off (S/CO) level of 4.0. RESULTS: Ninety-six percent of CCP donors suffered a mild disease or were asymptomatic. Older donors had higher antibody levels. Higher antibody levels (S/CO &#8805;4) were detected in 35.2% of the donors. Low positive (S/CO &#8805;1.4-3.99) were found in 37%, and 27.8% had undetectable antibodies (S/CO &#8804;1.4). The model predicted decrease antibody thresholds of 0.55%/day since the first CCP donation, providing guidance for the effective timing of future collections from donors with high antibody levels. CONCLUSIONS: An efficient CCP collection and distribution program was achieved, based on performing initial and repeated plasma collections, preferably from donors with higher antibody levels, and only antibody-rich units were supplied for therapeutic use. The inventory met the quantity and quality standards of the authorities, enabled to respond to the growing demand of the medical system and provide a product that may contribute to improve prognosis in patients with COVID-19.","Izak, Marina; Gendelman, Veronica; Bransburg-Zabary, Sharron; Stoyanov, Evgeniy; Gat, Roni; Cohen, Daniel; Chen, Jacob; Maor, Yasmin; Benov, Avi; Lev, Boaz; Zimhony, Oren; Shinar, Eilat",Vox sang,,571

In this work, we use magnetic-based localization. As Earth’s geomagnetic field is stable in time and is not affected by nonmagnetic materials, such as a large number of people in the robot’s surroundings, magnetic-based localization is ideal for service robotics in supermarkets, hotels, etc. A common approach for magnetic-based localization is to first create a magnetic map of the environment where the robot will be deployed. For this, magnetic samples acquired a priori are used. To generate this map, the collected data is interpolated by training a Gaussian Process Regression model. Gaussian processes are nonparametric, data-drive models, where the most important design choice is the selection of an adequate kernel function. These models are flexible and generate mean predictions as well as the confidence of those predictions, making them ideal for their use in probabilistic approaches. However, their computational and memory cost scales poorly when large datasets are used for training, making their use in large-scale environments challenging. The purpose of this study is to: (i) enable magnetic-based localization on large-scale environments by using a sparse representation of Gaussian processes, (ii) test the effect of several kernel functions on robot localization, and (iii) evaluate the accuracy of the approach experimentally on different large-scale environments.","Takebayashi, Takumi Miyagusuku Renato Ozaki Koichi",Sensors,,571

The opaqueness is especially concerning for hybrid OA, where subscription-based journals publish individual articles as OA if an optional fee is paid. This study addresses the lack of transparency by leveraging Elsevier article metadata and provides the first publisher-level study of hybrid OA uptake and invoicing. Our results show that Elsevier's hybrid OA uptake has grown steadily but slowly from 2015-2019, doubling the number of hybrid OA articles published per year and increasing the share of OA articles in Elsevier's hybrid journals from 2.6% to 3.7% of all articles. Further, we find that most hybrid OA articles were invoiced directly to authors, followed by articles invoiced through agreements with research funders, institutions, or consortia, with only a few funding bodies driving hybrid OA uptake. As such, our findings point to the role of publishing agreements and OA policies in hybrid OA publishing. Our results further demonstrate the value of publisher-provided metadata to improve the transparency in scholarly publishing by linking invoicing data to bibliometrics.","Jahn, Najko; Matthias, Lisa; Laakso, Mikael",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04789v1.pdf,571

Given that the virus is transmitted via droplets, open airway procedures such as bronchoscopy pose a significant risk to health-care workers (HCWs). The goal of this guideline was to examine the current evidence on the role of bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the optimal protection of patients and HCWs. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A group of approved panelists developed key clinical questions by using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) format that addressed specific topics on bronchoscopy related to COVID-19 infection and transmission. MEDLINE (via PubMed) was systematically searched for relevant literature and references were screened for inclusion. Validated evaluation tools were used to assess the quality of studies and to grade the level of evidence to support each recommendation. When evidence did not exist, suggestions were developed based on consensus using the modified Delphi process. RESULTS: The systematic review and critical analysis of the literature based on six PICO questions resulted in six statements: one evidence-based graded recommendation and 5 ungraded consensus-based statements. INTERPRETATION: The evidence on the role of bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic is sparse. To maximize protection of patients and HCWs, bronchoscopy should be used sparingly in the evaluation and management of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infections. In an area where community transmission of COVID-19 infection is present, bronchoscopy should be deferred for nonurgent indications, and if necessary to perform, HCWs should wear personal protective equipment while performing the procedure even on asymptomatic patients.","Wahidi, Momen M; Shojaee, Samira; Lamb, Carla R; Ost, David; Maldonado, Fabien; Eapen, George; Caroff, Daniel A; Stevens, Michael P; Ouellette, Daniel R; Lilly, Craig; Gardner, Donna D; Glisinski, Kristen; Pennington, Kelly; Alalawi, Raed",Chest,,571

345303,Covid-19: Denmark to kill 17 million minks over mutation that could undermine vaccine effort,2020,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about end-of-life care among Muslim patients, particularly during Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID) pandemic, which we report here. METHODS: The clinical characteristics, end-of-life care and resuscitation status of Muslim patients who died in the ICU of our tertiary care hospital in year 2020 from COVID were compared to Non-COVID patients. RESULTS: There were 32 patients in COVID and 64 in the Non-COVID group. A major proportion, mainly of Non-COVID patients, already had a hospice eligible terminal disease at baseline (p=.002). COVID patients were admitted to the ICU sooner after hospitalization (2.2 vs. 17 days), had prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation (18.5 vs. 6 days) and longer ICU stay (24 vs. 8 days) than non-COVID patients, respectively (p<.001). Almost all patients were ""Full Code"" initially. However, status was eventually changed to 'do-not-attempt resuscitation' (DNAR) in about 60% of the cohort. COVID patients were made DNAR late in their ICU stay, predominantly in the last 24 hours of life (p=.04). Until the very end, patients in both groups were on tube feeds, underwent blood draws and imaging, required high dose vasopressors, with few limitations or withdrawal of therapies. Family members were usually not present at bedside at time of death. There was minimal involvement of chaplain and palliative care services. CONCLUSIONS: Muslim COVID-19 patients had prolonged mechanical ventilation and ICU stay and a delayed decision to DNAR status than non-COVID Muslim patients. Limitation or withdrawal of therapy occurred infrequently. The utilization of chaplain and palliative care service needs improvement.","Khalid, Imran; Imran, Maryam; Yamani, Romaysaa M; Imran, Manahil; Akhtar, Muhammad Ali; Khalid, Tabindeh Jabeen",Am J Hosp Palliat Care,,571

345915,Amabie goes viral: the monstrous mercreature returns to battle the Gothic Covid‐19,2020,"With more than 1.7 million COVID-19 deaths, identifying effective measures to prevent COVID-19 is a top priority. We developed a mathematical model to simulate the COVID-19 pandemic with digital contact tracing and testing strategies. The model uses a real-world social network generated from a high-resolution contact data set of 180 students. This model incorporates infectivity variations, test sensitivities, incubation period, and asymptomatic cases. We present a method to extend the weighted temporal social network and present simulations on a network of 5000 students. The purpose of this work is to investigate optimal quarantine rules and testing strategies with digital contact tracing. The results show that the traditional strategy of quarantining direct contacts reduces infections by less than 20% without sufficient testing. Periodic testing every 2 weeks without contact tracing reduces infections by less than 3%. A variety of strategies are discussed including testing second and third degree contacts and the pre-exposure notification system, which acts as a social radar warning users how far they are from COVID-19. The most effective strategy discussed in this work was combining the pre-exposure notification system with testing second and third degree contacts. This strategy reduces infections by 18.3% when 30% of the population uses the app, 45.2% when 50% of the population uses the app, 72.1% when 70% of the population uses the app, and 86.8% when 95% of the population uses the app. When simulating the model on an extended network of 5000 students, the results are similar with the contact tracing app reducing infections by up to 79%.","Xu, Daniel",Math Biosci,,571

Here, we developed a synthetic soluble SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) DNA-based vaccine candidate, GX-19. In mice, immunization with GX-19 elicited not only S-specific systemic and pulmonary antibody responses but also Th1-biased T cell responses in a dose-dependent manner. GX-19-vaccinated nonhuman primates seroconverted rapidly and exhibited a detectable neutralizing antibody response as well as multifunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Notably, when the immunized nonhuman primates were challenged at 10 weeks after the last vaccination with GX-19, they had reduced viral loads in contrast to non-vaccinated primates as a control. These findings indicate that GX-19 vaccination provides a durable protective immune response and also support further development of GX-19 as a vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2.","Seo, Yong Bok; Suh, You Suk; Ryu, Ji In; Jang, Hwanhee; Oh, Hanseul; Koo, Bon-Sang; Seo, Sang-Hwan; Hong, Jung Joo; Song, Manki; Kim, Sung-Joo; Sung, Young Chul",,,571

Digital phenotyping helps promote the compliance with these policies through the personalized behavioral knowledge it produces. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the value of smartphone-derived digital phenotypes in (1) analyzing individuals' compliance with COVID-19 policies through behavioral responses and (2) suggesting ways to personalize communication through those policies. METHODS: We conducted longitudinal experiments that started before the outbreak of COVID-19 and continued during the pandemic. A total of 16 participants were recruited before the pandemic, and a smartphone sensing app was installed for each of them. We then assessed individual compliance with COVID-19 policies and their impact on habitual behaviors. RESULTS: Our results show a significant change in people's mobility (P<.001) as a result of COVID-19 regulations, from an average of 10 visited places every week to approximately 2 places a week. We also discussed our results within the context of nudges used by the National Health Service in the United Kingdom to promote COVID-19 regulations. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that digital phenotyping has substantial value in understanding people's behavior during a pandemic. Behavioral features extracted from digital phenotypes can facilitate the personalization of and compliance with behavioral policies.

346408,Prisons and COVID-19: A Desperate Call for Gerontological Expertise in Correctional Healthcare,2020,"Lung imaging and autopsy reports among COVID-19 patients show elevated lung scarring (fibrosis). Early data from COVID-19 patients as well as previous studies from severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and other respiratory disorders show that the extent of lung fibrosis is associated with a higher mortality, prolonged ventilator dependence, and poorer long-term health prognosis. Current treatments to halt or reverse lung fibrosis are limited; thus, the rapid development of effective antifibrotic therapies is a major global medical need that will continue far beyond the current COVID-19 pandemic. Reproducible fibrosis screening assays with high signal-to-noise ratios and disease-relevant readouts such as extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition (the hallmark of fibrosis) are integral to any antifibrotic therapeutic development. Therefore, we have established an automated high-throughput and high-content primary screening assay measuring transforming growth factor-ß (TGFß)-induced ECM deposition from primary human lung fibroblasts in a 384-well format. This assay combines longitudinal live cell imaging with multiparametric high-content analysis of ECM deposition. Using this assay, we have screened a library of 2743 small molecules representing approved drugs and late-stage clinical candidates. Confirmed hits were subsequently profiled through a suite of secondary lung fibroblast phenotypic screening assays quantifying cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. In silico target prediction and pathway network analysis were applied to the confirmed hits. We anticipate this suite of assays and data analysis tools will aid the identification of new treatments to mitigate against lung fibrosis associated with COVID-19 and other fibrotic diseases.","Marwick, John A; Elliott, Richard J R; Longden, James; Makda, Ashraff; Hirani, Nik; Dhaliwal, Kevin; Dawson, John C; Carragher, Neil O",SLAS Discov,,571

347064,Resolving COVID-19: How Important Is the People's Cautiousness Level for Its Successfulness?,2021-08-05,"BACKGROUND: In the current coronavirus health crisis, inhaled bronchodilators(IB) have been suggested as a possible treatment for patients hospitalized. Patients with evidence of Covid-19 pneumonia worldwide have been prescribed these medications as part of therapy for the disease, an indication for which this medications could be ineffective taken on account the pathophysiology and mechanisms of disease progression. OBJECTIVE: The main objective was to evaluate whether there is an association between IB use and length of stay. Primary end points were the number of days that a patient stayed in the hospital and death as a final event in a time to event analysis. Pneumonia severity, oxygen requirement, involved drugs, comorbidity, historical or current respiratory diagnoses and other drugs prescribed to treat coronavirus pneumonia were also evaluated. METHODS: A descriptive, observational, cross-sectional study was performed in this tertiary hospital in Madrid (Spain). Data were obtained regarding patients hospitalized with Covid-19, excluding those who were intubated. The primary and secondary outcomes such as duration of hospitalization and death were compared in patients who received IB with those in patients who did not. RESULTS: 327 patients were evaluated, mean age was 64.4 ± 15.8 years. Median length of hospitalization stay was 10 days. Of them 292 (89.3%) overcame the disease, the remaining 35 died. Patients who had received IB did not have less mortality rate (odds ratio 0.839; 95% CI: 0.401 to 1.752) and less hospitalization period when compared with patients who did not received IB (odds ratio 1.280; 95% CI: 0.813 to 2.027). There was no significant association between IB use and recovery or death. Hypertension and diabetes were the most common comorbidities. The prevalence of chronic respiratory disease in our cohort was low (21.1%). Anticholinergics were the IB more frequently prescribed for Covid-19 pneumonia. Better response in patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids was not observed. CONCLUSION: Off-label indication of inhaled-bronchodilators for Covid-19 patients are common in admitted patients. Taken on account our results, the use of IB for coronavirus pneumonia apparently is not associated with a significantly patient's improvement. Our study confirms the hypothesis that inhaled bronchodilators do not improve clinical outcomes or reduce the risk of Covid-19 mortality. This could be due to the fact that the virus mainly affects the lung parenchyma and the pulmonary vasculature and probably not the airway. More researches are necessary in order to fill the gap in evidence for this new indication.","Villamañán, Elena; Sobrino, Carmen; Carpio, Carlos; Moreno, Marta; Arancón, Ana; Lara, Catalina; Pérez, Ester; Jiménez, Carlos; Zamarrón, Ester; Jiménez-Nácher, Inmaculada; Herrero, Alicia; Álvarez-Sala, Rodolfo",Pulm Pharmacol Ther,,571

347391,Has Sweden's controversial covid-19 strategy been successful?,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Patients with COVID-19 may present with respiratory syndromes indistinguishable from common viruses. This poses a challenge for early detection during triage in the emergency department (ED). Over a 3-month period, our ED aimed to minimize nosocomial transmission by using broader suspect case criteria for better detection and using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers (HCWs). METHODS: All ED admissions with respiratory syndromes over a 3-month period were tested for COVID-19. The sensitivity and specificity of screening criteria in detecting COVID-19 were assessed. A risk-stratified approach was adopted for PPE usage in the ED, based on high-risk ""fever areas"" and lower-risk zones. When a case of COVID-19 was confirmed, surveillance was conducted for potentially exposed patients and HCWs. RESULTS: A total of 1,841 cases presenting with respiratory syndromes required admission over the study period. Among these, 70 cases of COVID-19 were subsequently confirmed. The majority (84.2%, 59/70) were detected at ED triage because they fulfilled suspect case criteria. Of these, 34 met the official screening criteria; an additional 25 were detected by the broader internal screening criteria. Over the 12-week period, the cumulative sensitivity of internal screening criteria was 84.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 73.6% to 91.9%), whereas the sensitivity of the official screening criteria was 48.6% (95% CI = 36.4% to 60.8%). Given the broadened internal criteria, the preexisting ED ""fever area"" was insufficient and had to be expanded. However, there were no cases of nosocomial transmission from intra-ED exposure, despite extensive surveillance. CONCLUSION: Frontline physicians need to be given leeway to decide on the disposition of cases based on clinical suspicion during an ongoing outbreak of COVID-19. If a broader criterion is used at ED triage, ED facilities and isolation facilities need to be readied to accommodate a surge of suspect cases. Usage of appropriate PPE is essential in minimizing nosocomial transmission.","Wee, Liang E; Fua, Tzay-Ping; Chua, Ying Y; Ho, Andrew F W; Sim, Xiang Y J; Conceicao, Edwin P; Venkatachalam, Indumathi; Tan, Kenneth B-K; Tan, Ban H",Acad Emerg Med,,571

World Health Organization (WHO) has already praised their contribution and their essential role in controlling this disease. Some of the main concerns of covid-19's impact to health service staff include work overload, exhaustion, and high risk of self-infection or transmission to family members. Moreover, during the pandemic, caregivers' mental health inevitably becomes vulnerable, with salient stress and anxiety-related symptoms. Uncertainty, fear of contagion, guilt, hopelessness, stigmatization and, in some cases, long-term post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are few of the potential effects posed by this outbreak on health workers. In this review, lessons learnt from previous global crises or pandemics on the psychological impact of health workers are presented. History could potentially provide essential information on how to best manage, support and optimize our approach to this highly appreciated and much needed group of professionals. Targeted and prompt interventions could reduce the psychological strain of health professionals, thus, further improving provided patient care.

A prospective cohort study with data collection at three phases (before, during and after Hajj) was conducted among Australian pilgrims between August and December 2015. Baseline datawere collected from421 pilgrims beforeHajj, with 391 providing follow-up data duringHajj and 300 after their home return. Most participants (78% [329/421]) received one or more recommended vaccines; travel agents' advice was the main factor affecting vaccination uptake. Most participants (69% [270/391]) practiced hand hygiene with soap and sanitizers frequently, followed by disposable handkerchief use (36% [139/391]) and washing hands with water only (28% [111/391]). During Hajj 74% (288/391) of participants reported one or more illness symptoms, 86% (248/288) of these symptoms were respiratory. Cough was less often reported among pilgrims who received vaccinations, cleaned their hands with soap or alcoholic hand rubs, while a runny nose was less common among those who frequently washed their hands with plain water but was more common among those who used facemasks. This study reveals that most Australian Hajj pilgrims complied with key preventative measures, and that tour group operators' advice played an important role in compliance. Pilgrims who were vaccinated and practiced hand hygiene were less likely to report infection symptoms.","Alqahtani, Amani Salem; Tashani, Mohamed; Heywood, Anita Elizabeth; Almohammed, Abdulrahman Bader S.; Booy, Robert; Wiley, Kerrie Elizabeth; Rashid, Harunor",Pharm.,,571

We thus aimed to investigate changes in different training modalities in elite and amateur football players following COVID-19 lockdown in March 2020. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study we applied a Likert scale-based questionnaire with 20 items to quantify and classify time spent at standard training methods in 47 professional and 54 amateur football players from 12 Austrian clubs before and during lockdown. Additionally, McLean score was calculated to assess perceived training fatigue. RESULTS: Weekly amount of training time at endurance exercises (cycling) increased in both professional (37.5 [IQR 46.5] min/week vs. 187.5 [IQR 127.5] min/week, p<0.001), and amateur players (0.0 [IQR 45.0] min/week vs. 37.5 [IQR 112.5] min/week, p=0.015) during COVID-19 lockdown. Time on diverse muscle strengthening workouts was significantly elevated in both cohorts. Total training time at ball declined for professionals (from 472.5 [IQR 150] min/week to 15.0 [IQR 112.5] min/week, p<0.001) and amateurs (from 337.5 [IQR 285] min/week to 0.0 [IQR 37.5] min/week, p<0.001). Videoguided training was intensified in both groups (p<0.001 each). Location shifted from football fields and gyms to home and outdoors. Overall McLean score remained unchanged in amateurs (p=0.42) while elite players showed a trend towards an increase (p=0.056). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 lockdown compromised football training, especially training concepts with ball. Consequently, resulting changes in exercise loads and muscular burden might impact susceptibility for injuries and impair performances especially in amateur players, especially as they lacked training supervision and professional training plans. Minimum effective dose of training workload in order to maintain endurance- and neuromuscular-related performance parameters should be prescribed.","Schüttler, Dominik; Hamm, Wolfgang; Krammer, Simone; Steffen, Julius; Deuster, Eileen; Lauseker, Michael; Egger, Florian; Meyer, Tim; Brunner, Stefan",J. sports med. phys. fit,,571

349506,Israel's COVID-19 endgame,2021,"Background: Although breastfeeding is optimal infant nutrition, disparities in breastfeeding persist in the African American population. AMEN (Avondale Moms Empowered to Nurse) launched a Peer-to-Peer support group to increase breastfeeding initiation and duration in an under-resourced African American urban community with low breastfeeding rates. Materials and Methods: A Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR)-guided project was developed in partnership with a neighborhood church. Using modified Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) peer counseling materials, Avondale neighborhood breastfeeding moms were trained and designated Breastfeeding Champions. Community organizations and partnering agencies helped recruit local mothers. Support groups included childcare, transportation, refreshments, and incentives, plus stipends for Champions. A mixed-methods approach captured participation, feeding intention and practices, and program evaluation using electronic data capture. After adding another neighborhood with low breastfeeding rates, AMEN was modified to ""All Moms Empowered to Nurse."" Additional Champion moms were trained as Reaching Our Sisters Everywhere (ROSE) Community Transformers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the group has met weekly by virtual platform. Results: Since May 2017, 67 AMEN support meetings have included 158 participants, with average attendance of 10 (range 5-19) per meeting. In addition to 8 Champions, 110 moms have attended, including 24% expecting mothers. Additional attendees include 13 family support persons, 23 guest speakers, and 12 from community outreach programs. Qualitative feedback from participants has been uniformly positive. Breastfeeding initiation rates have increased 12% in the initial neighborhood.

350271,Covid-19: Chief statistician criticises government over reporting of testing,2020,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the cause of a global pandemic which has strained the resources of health systems around the world. Health systems, patients, and healthcare providers may benefit from knowledge regarding which factors predict length of stay (LOS), and therefore healthcare resource allocation, in patients presenting with COVID-19. Methods: 559 patients were retrospectively identified who were admitted to Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia, PA between February and May of 2020. All patients tested positive for COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab and received computed tomography screening for viral pneumonia. We collected data present at time of hospital admission and performed a retrospective analysis to determine factors associated with hospital LOS. Results: Mean hospital LOS for our cohort was 9.0 days. In this cohort, most patients received antibiotics. 100% of patients received glucocorticoids and 8.1% received remdesivir. 31.2% participated in clinical trials of monoclonal antibodies. 26.8% of patients required intensive care during their hospitalization, 17.4% required invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and 11.1% died. On multivariable linear regression analysis, increasing leukocyte count and a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus predicted decreased LOS. Increased respiratory support within the first 24 hours, patient age, creatinine, and total bilirubin were associated with increased LOS. Conclusion: Patient past medical history, admission laboratory values, and severity of hypoxemia at hospital admission may predict LOS in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.

Moreover, an open waste bin is placed in each user's cubicle to collect used toilet paper and tissues. Such practices, which are common in East Asia and central America, have induced a dilemma of toilet paper disposal because some municipalities have removed waste bins from public toilets to prevent virus transmission by fecal matter. As a consequence, users were forced to flush down their used toilet paper and tissues. Yet, it is unknown whether standard toilet paper can be flushed easily without causing issues in sewer operations. Here, we surveyed the conditions of toilets in university campus and other public facilities in different regions across China. We also evaluated the disintegration characteristics of toilet paper products both by conducting online surveys and by physical disintegration experiments. We found that only 15% of toilets provided toilet paper, while open waste bins occurred at nearly all sites. Further, our survey indicated that 82% of toilet paper products sold in China did not give any indication on their flushability, whereas 77% of US products did. Disintegration results showed that none of the five popular, best-selling toilet paper products passed the flushability standard.

350627,"Covid-19 vs. Ebola: Impact on households and small businesses in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo",2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health crisis. Numerous cancer patients from non-Western countries, including the United Arab Emirates (UAE), seek cancer care outside their home countries and many are sponsored by their governments for treatment. Many patients interrupted their cancer treatment abruptly and so returned to their home countries with unique challenges. In this review we will discuss practical challenges and recommendations for all cancer patients returning to their home countries from treatment abroad. METHOD: Experts from medical, surgical and other cancer subspecialties in the UAE were invited to form a taskforce to address challenges and propose recommendations for patients returning home from abroad after medical tourism during the SARS-COV-19 Pandemic. RESULTS: The taskforce which consisted of experts from medical oncology, hematology, surgical oncology, radiation oncology, pathology, radiology and palliative care summarized the current challenges and suggested a practical approaches to address these specific challenges to improve the returning cancer patients care. Lack of medical documentation, pathology specimens and radiology images are one of the major limitations on the continuation of the cancer care for returning patients. Difference in approaches and treatment recommendations between the existing treating oncologists abroad and receiving oncologists in the UAE regarding the optimal management which can be addressed by early and empathic communications with patients and by engaging the previous treating oncologists in treatment planning based on the available resources and expertise in the UAE. Interruption of curative radiotherapy (RT) schedules which can potentially increase risk of treatment failure has been a major challenge, RT dose-compensation calculation should be considered in these circumstances. CONCLUSION: The importance of a thorough clinical handover cannot be overstated and regulatory bodies are needed to prevent what can be considered unethical procedure towards returning cancer patients with lack of an effective handover. Clear communication is paramount to gain the trust of returning patients and their families. This pandemic may also serve as an opportunity to encourage patients to receive treatment locally in their home country. Future studies will be needed to address the steps to retain cancer patients in the UAE rather than seeking cancer treatment abroad.","Al-Shamsi, Humaid O; Abu-Gheida, Ibrahim; Rana, Shabeeha K; Nijhawan, Neil; Abdulsamad, Ahmed S; Alrawi, Sadir; Abuhaleeqa, Mohamed; Almansoori, Taleb M; Alkasab, Thamir; Aleassa, Essa M; McManus, Martine C",BMC Cancer,,571

Graduate medical education of orthopedic surgeons was not spared from the jarring changes. Purpose: We sought to survey fellowship program directors in the field of orthopedic surgery about how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the education of the 2019 to 2020 and 2020 to 2021 fellowship classes and the future of their programs. Methods: In October 2020, an 18-item survey was distributed by an official of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) to the specialty societies that govern fellowship training. Each specialty society then distributed the survey to its respective program directors. A reminder email was sent during the enrollment period. Each respondent was able to complete the survey once. Survey questions were grouped into 3 sections: general information about the fellowship training programs, the impact of COVID-19 on the 2019 to 2020 fellowship class, and the future impact of COVID-19 on the fellowship training programs. Results: Of the 564 accredited orthopedic surgery fellowship programs in the United States, 190 directors responded. Of these, 73.59% reported COVID-19 had a negative impact on the 2019 to 2020 fellowship class. A normal distribution of responses was found regarding didactic and academic learning, research, and mentorship opportunities. A majority of respondents said they believe that there will be no negative impact on patient care the fellows provide in the years to come. Conclusion: Orthopedic surgery fellowship program directors acknowledged that while there were negative effects to training in the pandemic, they did not think these would negatively affect patient care provided by 2019 to 2020 fellows in the short and medium term. They also reported positive outcomes from the experience of the pandemic, including new ways to educate fellows.","Heaps, Braiden M.; Dugas, Jeffrey R.; Limpisvasti, Orr",HSS Journal®,,571

However, few studies have investigated the effects of mechanically stretched -MSCs (MS-MSCs) in in vitro models of ARDS. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential therapeutic effects of MS-MSCs on pulmonary microvascular endothelium barrier injuries induced by LPS. We introduced a cocultured model of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (EC) and MSC medium obtained from MSCs with or without mechanical stretch. We found that Wright-Giemsa staining revealed that MSC morphology changed significantly and cell plasma shrank separately after mechanical stretch. Cell proliferation of the MS-MSC groups was much lower than the untreated MSC group; expression of cell surface markers did not change significantly. Compared to the medium from untreated MSCs, inflammatory factors elevated statistically in the medium from MS-MSCs. Moreover, the paracellular permeability of endothelial cells treated with LPS was restored with a medium from MS-MSCs, while LPS-induced EC apoptosis decreased. In addition, protective effects on the remodeling of intercellular junctions were observed when compared to LPS-treated endothelial cells. These data demonstrated that the MS-MSC groups had potential therapeutic effects on the LPS-treated ECs; these results might be useful in the treatment of ARDS.","Li, Jin-Ze; Meng, Shan-Shan; Xu, Xiu-Ping; Huang, Yong-Bo; Mao, Pu; Li, Yi-Min; Yang, Yi; Qiu, Hai-Bo; Pan, Chun",Stem Cells Int,,571

Lack of international guidelines leaves health care providers with a case-to-case approach for delivering optimal cancer care in the wake of the pandemic. Transition to telemedicine has somewhat bridged the gap for in-office visits, but there is a continuing challenge of delays in cancer screening or significant decline of new diagnoses of cancers due to the pandemic.

We had previously published the results of a survey to the affected patients from 6 institutions. We now present the results of a larger distribution of this survey, through May and June 2020, to electively scheduled patients representing different regions of the United States. Methods: Fifteen centers identified through the AAHKS Research Committee participated in a survey study of THA and TKA patients. Patients scheduled for primary elective THA or TKA but canceled due to the COVID-19 elective surgery stoppage (3/2020-5/2020) were included in the study. Descriptive statistics along with subgroup analysis with Wilcoxon rank were performed. Results: In total, surveys were distributed to 2135 patients and completed by 848 patients (40%) from 15 institutions. Most patients (728/848, 86%) had their surgery postponed or canceled by the surgeon or hospital. Unknown length of surgical delay remained the highest source of anxiety among survey participants. Male patients were more likely to be willing to proceed with surgery in spite of COVID-19. There were minimal regional differences in responses. Only 61 patients (7%) stated they will continue to delay surgery for fear of contracting COVID-19 while in the hospital. Conclusion: Similar to the previous study, the most anxiety-provoking thought was the uncertainty over if and when the canceled joint replacement surgery could be rescheduled. Patients suffering from the daily pain of hip and knee arthritis that have been scheduled for elective arthroplasty remain eager to have their operation as soon as elective surgery is allowed to resume.","Brown, Timothy S; Bedard, Nicholas A; Rojas, Edward O; Anthony, Christopher A; Schwarzkopf, Ran; Stambough, Jeffrey B; Nandi, Sumon; Prieto, Hernan; Parvizi, Javad; Bini, Stefano A; Higuera, Carlos A; Piuzzi, Nicholas S; Blankstein, Michael; Wellman, Samuel S; Dietz, Matthew J; Jennings, Jason M; Dasa, Vinod",,,571

Methods: Data of Colombian confirmed deaths of COVID-19 until June 11, 2020, were included in this analysis (n=1488 deaths). Relationships between COVID-19, combinations of health conditions and age were explored using locally weighted polynomial regressions. Results: The most frequent health conditions were high blood pressure, respiratory disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and kidney disease. Dyads more frequents were high blood pressure with diabetes, cardiovascular disease or respiratory disease. Some multimorbidity patterns increase probability of death among older individuals, whereas other patterns are not age-related, or decrease the probability of death among older people. Not all multimorbidity increases with age, as is commonly thought. Obesity, alone or with other diseases, was associated with a higher risk of severity among young people, while the risk of the high blood pressure/diabetes dyad tends to have an inverted U distribution in relation with age. Conclusions: Classification of individuals according to multimorbidity in the medical management of COVID-19 patients is important to determine the possible etiological models and to define patient triage for hospitalization. Moreover, identification of non-infected individuals with high-risk ages and multimorbidity patterns serves to define possible interventions of selective confinement or special management.","Fernández-Niño, Julián A; Guerra-Gómez, John A; J Idrovo, Avaro",Rev Panam Salud Publica,,571

Until a vaccine is available, personal protection, social distancing, and disinfection are the main tools against SARS-CoV-2. Although it is quite infectious, the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself is an enveloped virus that is relatively fragile because its protective fatty layer is sensitive to heat, ultraviolet radiation, and certain chemicals. However, heat and liquid treatments can damage some materials, and ultraviolet light is not efficient in shaded areas, so other disinfection alternatives are required to allow safe re-utilization of materials and spaces. As of this writing, evidences are still accumulating for the use of ozone gas as a disinfectant for sanitary materials and ambient disinfection in indoor areas. This paper reviews the most relevant results of virus disinfection by the application of gaseous ozone. The review covers disinfection treatments of both air and surfaces carried out in different volumes, which varies from small boxes and controlled chambers to larger rooms, as a base to develop future ozone protocols against COVID-19. Published papers have been critically analyzed to evaluate trends in the required ozone dosages, as a function of relative humidity (RH), contact time, and viral strains. The data have been classified depending on the disinfection objective and the volume and type of the experimental set-up. Based on these data, conservative dosages and times to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 are estimated. In small chambers, 10-20 mg ozone/m3 over 10 to 50 min can be sufficient to significantly reduce the virus load of personal protection equipment. In large rooms, 30 to 50 mg ozone/m3 would be required for treatments of 20-30 min. Maximum antiviral activity of ozone is achieved at high humidity, while the same ozone concentrations under low RH could result inefficient. At these ozone levels, safety protocols must be strictly followed. These data can be used for reducing significantly the viral load although for assuring a safe disinfection, the effective dosages under different conditions need to be confirmed with experimental data.","Blanco, Angeles; Ojembarrena, Francisco de Borja; Clavo, Bernardino; Negro, Carlos",,,571

COVID-19 victims are almost associated with cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and other underlying diseases. Concerning the high prevalence of these disorders, widespread mortality threatens global society, and its fatality rate may increase with increasing COVID-19 prevalence in countries with older populations. Therefore, evaluating patients' clinical status with severe COVID-19 infection and their medical history can help manage treatment. Currently, one of the considered treatments is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) inhibition. This study investigated virus entry mechanisms through membrane receptors, their role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and underlying diseases, and treatment methods based on the viral entrance inhibition. According to existing studies, inhibition of ACE2 can increase oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis and ultimately exacerbate underlying diseases such as cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, diabetes, and hypertension in individuals with COVID-19. The ACE2 inhibition is not suitable for patients with COVID-19 with underlying diseases, but it seems that the recombinant ACE2 solution is more appropriate for inhibiting the virus in these patients if hypotension would be monitored.","Musavi, Hadis; Abazari, Omid; Safaee, Mohamad Sadegh; Variji, Atena; Koohshekan, Bahare; Kalaki-Jouybari, Fatemeh; Barartabar, Zeinab; Hakemi, Pejman; Mahjoub, Soleiman",Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol,,571

We assessed the compliance of health workers with infection prevention and control practices relevant to COVID-19 in outpatient settings in Tanzania, before the pandemic. METHODS: This study was based on a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data collected as part of a randomised controlled trial in private for-profit dispensaries and health centres and in faith-based dispensaries, health centres, and hospitals, in 18 regions. We observed provider-patient interactions in outpatient consultation rooms, laboratories, and dressing rooms, and categorised infection prevention and control practices into four domains: hand hygiene, glove use, disinfection of reusable equipment, and waste management. We calculated compliance as the proportion of indications (infection risks) in which a health worker performed a correct action, and examined associations between compliance and health worker and facility characteristics using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression models. FINDINGS: Between Feb 7 and April 5, 2018, we visited 228 health facilities, and observed at least one infection prevention and control indication in 220 facilities (118 [54%] dispensaries, 66 [30%] health centres, and 36 [16%] hospitals). 18â710 indications were observed across 734 health workers (49 [7%] medical doctors, 214 [29%] assistant medical officers or clinical officers, 106 [14%] nurses or midwives, 126 [17%] clinical assistants, and 238 [32%] laboratory technicians or assistants). Compliance was 6·9% for hand hygiene (n=8655 indications), 74·8% for glove use (n=4915), 4·8% for disinfection of reusable equipment (n=841), and 43·3% for waste management (n=4299). Facility location was not associated with compliance in any of the infection prevention and control domains. Facility level and ownership were also not significantly associated with compliance, except for waste management. For hand hygiene, nurses and midwives (odds ratio 5·80 [95% CI 3·91-8·61]) and nursing and medical assistants (2·65 [1·67-4·20]) significantly outperformed the reference category of assistant medical officers or clinical officers. For glove use, nurses and midwives (10·06 [6·68-15·13]) and nursing and medical assistants (5·93 [4·05-8·71]) also significantly outperformed the reference category. Laboratory technicians performed significantly better in glove use (11·95 [8·98-15·89]), but significantly worse in hand hygiene (0·27 [0·17-0·43]) and waste management (0·25 [0·14-0·44] than the reference category. Health worker age was negatively associated with correct glove use and female health workers were more likely to comply with hand hygiene. INTERPRETATION: Health worker infection prevention and control compliance, particularly for hand hygiene and disinfection, was inadequate in these outpatient settings. Improvements in provision of supplies and health worker behaviours are urgently needed in the face of the current pandemic.

In this study, we combined recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), as a means of isothermal DNA amplification, with an rkDNA-graphene oxide (GO) probe system to allow the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 with high sensitivity and selectivity. We used in situ enzymatic synthesis to prepare an rkDNA probe that was complementary to an RPA-amplified sequence of the target N-gene of SARS-CoV-2. The fluorescence of this rkDNA was perfectly quenched in the presence of GO. When the quenched rkDNA-GO system was added to the RPA-amplified sequence of the target SARS-CoV-2, the fluorescence recovered dramatically. The combined RPA/rkDNA-GO system exhibited extremely high selectivity (discrimination factor: 17.2) and sensitivity (LOD = 6.0 aM) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The total processing time was only 1.6 h.

The global outbreak of this novel coronavirus has now infected >20 million people worldwide, with >5 million cases in the United States (11 August 2020). The development of diagnostic and research tools to determine infection and vaccine efficacy is critically needed. We have developed multiple serologic assays using newly designed SARS-CoV-2 reagents for detecting the presence of receptor-binding antibodies in sera. The first assay is surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based and can quantitate both antibody binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and blocking to the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in a single experiment. The second assay is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based and can measure competition and blocking of the ACE2 receptor to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with antispike antibodies. The assay is highly versatile, and we demonstrate the broad utility of the assay by measuring antibody functionality of sera from small animals and nonhuman primates immunized with an experimental SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In addition, we employ the assay to measure receptor blocking of sera from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. The assay is shown to correlate with pseudovirus neutralization titers. This type of rapid, surrogate neutralization diagnostic can be employed widely to help study SARS-CoV-2 infection and assess the efficacy of vaccines.","Walker, Susanne N; Chokkalingam, Neethu; Reuschel, Emma L; Purwar, Mansi; Xu, Ziyang; Gary, Ebony N; Kim, Kevin Y; Helble, Michaela; Schultheis, Katherine; Walters, Jewell; Ramos, Stephanie; Muthumani, Kar; Smith, Trevor R F; Broderick, Kate E; Tebas, Pablo; Patel, Ami; Weiner, David B; Kulp, Daniel W",J. clin. microbiol,,571

354302,Controlling Covid-19 Transference,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has highly variable disease severity and a bimodal course characterized by acute respiratory viral infection followed by hyperinflammation in a subset of patients with severe disease. This immune dysregulation is characterized by lymphocytopenia, elevated levels of plasma cytokines and proliferative and exhausted T cells, among other dysfunctional cell types. Immunocompromised persons often fare worse in the context of acute respiratory infections, but preliminary data suggest this may not hold true for COVID-19. In this review, we explore the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on mortality in four populations with distinct forms of immunocompromise: (1) persons with hematological malignancies (HM) and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) recipients; (2) solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs); (3) persons with rheumatological diseases; and (4) persons living with HIV (PLWH). For each population, key immunological defects are described and how these relate to the immune dysregulation in COVID-19. Next, outcomes including mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection are described for each population, giving comparisons to the general population of age-matched and comorbidity-matched controls. In these four populations, iatrogenic or disease-related immunosuppression is not clearly associated with poor prognosis in HM, HCT, SOTR, rheumatological diseases, or HIV. However, certain individual immunosuppressants or disease states may be associated with harmful or beneficial effects, including harm from severe CD4 lymphocytopenia in PLWH and possible benefit to the calcineurin inhibitor ciclosporin in SOTRs, or tumor necrosis factor-&#945; inhibitors in persons with rheumatic diseases. Lastly, insights gained from clinical and translational studies are explored as to the relevance for repurposing of immunosuppressive host-directed therapies for the treatment of hyperinflammation in COVID-19 in the general population.","Goldman, Jason D; Robinson, Philip C; Uldrick, Thomas S; Ljungman, Per",J. immunotherap. cancer,,571
354376,Making sure the New Zealand border is not our Achilles heel: repeated cross-sectional COVID-19 surveys in primary care,2021,"The COVID-19 recession that started in March 2020 led to an unprecedented decline in economic activity across the globe. To fight this recession, policy makers in central banks engaged in expansionary monetary policy. This paper asks whether the measures adopted by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) have been effective in boosting real activity and calming financial markets. To measure these effects at high frequencies, we propose a novel mixed frequency vector autoregressive (MF-VAR) model. This model allows us to combine weekly and monthly information within an unified framework. Our model combines a set of macroeconomic aggregates such as industrial production, unemployment rates and inflation with high frequency information from financial markets such as stock prices, interest rate spreads and weekly information on the Feds balance sheet size. The latter set of high frequency time series is used to dynamically interpolate the monthly time series to obtain weekly macroeconomic measures. We use this setup to simulate counterfactuals in absence of monetary stimulus. The results show that the monetary expansion caused higher output growth and stock market returns, more favorable long-term financing conditions and a depreciation of the US dollar compared to a no-policy benchmark scenario.","Feldkircher, Martin; Huber, Florian; Pfarrhofer, Michael",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15419v1.pdf,571

In spite of its clinical relevance and impact on feline health, currently the therapeutic possibilities for treatment of FIP in cats are limited. The emergence of the pandemic Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), etiological agent of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), able to infect a broad spectrum of animal species including cats, triggered the interest for the development of novel molecules with antiviral activity for treatment of CoV infections in humans and animals. Essential oils (EOs) have raised significant attention for their antiviral properties integrating and, in some cases, replacing conventional drugs. Thymus vulgaris EO (TEO) has been previously shown to be effective against several RNA viruses including CoVs. In the present study the antiviral efficacy of TEO against FIPV was evaluated in vitro. TEO at 27 µg/ml was able to inhibit virus replication with a significant reduction of 2 log10 TCID50/50 µl. Moreover, virucidal activity was tested using TEO at 27 and 270 µg/ml, over the cytotoxic threshold, determining a reduction of viral titre as high as 3.25 log10 TCID50/50 µl up to 1 h of time contact. These results open several perspectives in terms of future applications and therapeutic possibilities for coronaviruses considering that FIPV infection in cats could be a potential model for the study of antivirals against CoVs.","Catella, Cristiana; Camero, Michele; Lucente, Maria Stella; Fracchiolla, Giuseppe; Sblano, Sabina; Tempesta, Maria; Martella, Vito; Buonavoglia, Canio; Lanave, Gianvito",Res Vet Sci,,571

AIM: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on female sexual function and frequency in the United States. METHODS: A pre-pandemic survey containing the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and demographic questions was completed by adult women in the United States from October 20, 2019 and March 1, 2020. The same women were sent a follow-up survey also containing the FSFI, as well as the Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety with 4 items (PHQ-4), and questions pertaining to mask wearing habits, job loss, and relationship changes. Risk for female sexual dysfunction (RFSD) was defined as FSFI < 26.55. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Differences in pre-pandemic and intra-pandemic female sexual function, measured by the FSFI, and sexual frequency. RESULTS: Ninety-one women were included in this study. Overall FSFI significantly decreased during the pandemic (27.2 vs 28.8, P = .002), with domain-specific decreases in arousal (4.41 vs 4.86, P = .0002), lubrication (4.90 vs 5.22, P = .004), and satisfaction (4.40 vs 4.70, P = .04). There was no change in sexual frequency. Contingency table analysis of RFSD prior to and during the pandemic revealed significantly increased RFSD during the pandemic (P = .002). Women who developed RFSD during the pandemic had higher PHQ-4 anxiety subscale scores (3.74 vs 2.53, P = .01) and depression subscale scores (2.74 vs 1.43, P = .001) than those who did not. Development of FSD was not associated with age, home region, relationship status, mask wearing habits, knowing someone who tested positive for COVID-19, relationship change, or job loss and/or reduction during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: In this population of female cannabis users, risk for sexual dysfunction increased amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and is associated with depression and anxiety symptoms.

354988,An epidemic model integrating direct and fomite transmission as well as household structure applied to COVID-19,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic might lead to more mental health problems. However, few studies have examined sleep problems, depression, and posttraumatic symptoms among the general adult population during the COVID-19 outbreak, and little is known about coping behaviors. This survey was conducted online in China from February 1st to February 10th, 2020. Quota sampling was used to recruit 2993 Chinese citizens aged &#8805;18 years old. Mental health problems were assessed with the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD) Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression inventory, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Exposure to COVID-19 was measured with questions about residence at outbreak, personal exposure, media exposure, and impact on livelihood. General coping style was measured by the brief Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). Respondents were also asked 12 additional questions about COVID-19 specific coping behaviors. Direct exposure to COVID-19 instead of the specific location of (temporary) residence within or outside the epicenter (Wuhan) of the pandemic seems important (standardized beta: 0.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.02-0.09). Less mental health problems were also associated with less intense exposure through the media (standardized beta: -0.07, 95% CI: -0.10--0.03). Perceived negative impact of the pandemic on livelihood showed a large effect size in predicting mental health problems (standardized beta: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.10-0.19). More use of cognitive and prosocial coping behaviors were associated with less mental health problems (standardized beta: -0.30, 95% CI: -0.34--0.27). Our study suggests that the mental health consequences of the lockdown impact on livelihood should not be underestimated. Building on cognitive coping behaviors reappraisal or cognitive behavioral treatments may be most promising.","Guo, Jing; Feng, Xing Lin; Wang, Xiao Hua; van IJzendoorn, Marinus H",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,571
355033,Perceptions and lessons from web-based interviews for the reproductive endocrinology and infertility fellowship application cycle,2021,"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has caused turmoil around the world. In Africa, some similarities and differences could be observed in the nature of the outbreak and the policy responses across the continent. This article discusses the policy responses and reflects on their effectiveness as a containment strategy. We speculate on why these strategies seem to work or not, and the lessons therein. The analysis also examines the setting up of crisis teams and whether they indicate lack of trust in the existing public administration system. The article argues that though South African cases and testing diverged significantly from the rest of the continent, a wider similarity can be observed in pandemic management across the continent. The article identifies some factors including quick and early measures, recent experience managing epidemic/health crises, and a display of some form of community resilience acquired over years of living in a state of poor governance as some of the important factors in the management of the pandemic. We find there is a dearth of scholarship on crisis management in the context of public administration and suggest this should be an object of future study in the field. The use of ad-hoc crisis teams that assume emergency powers is a common practice, but there is insufficient rigorous analysis to show their effectiveness and impact on existing bureaucratic institutions.","Sotola, David Olusegun; Pillay, Pregala; Gebreselassie, Hafte",Rev. adm. pública (Online),,571
355451,Re-conceptualising VET: responses to covid-19,2020,"A multi-wave study across two months tested changes in motivation for staying at home at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK and US in 683 living-alone older adults (mean age = 53 years), those that might experience greater psychological costs of being isolated for long periods of time. The study was focused on changes in two types of motivation: autonomous motivation- finding importance in the task of staying at home, and controlled motivation- staying at home because of felt pressure or choicelessness, as autonomous motivation predicts effective behavior change better than controlled motivation, especially long-term. Predictions grounded in self-determination theory (SDT) tested whether three motivating aspects of messages to stay at home from governmental and public health agencies, physicians, the news, and family and friends predicted changes in these motivations across time. Perceiving messages to stay at home as controlling predicted increases in controlled motivation and decreases in autonomous motivation over two months. Conversely, perceiving messages to stay at home as autonomy supportive predicted increases in autonomous motivation over two months. Results for mandated orders to stay at home were intriguing: they related to increases in both controlled and autonomous motivations over time. Exploratory analyses revealed that increases in autonomous motivation over time predicted actual time spent at home reported at Wave 2, whereas increases in controlled motivation did not relate. Discussion focuses on contributions to theory and public health messaging about behavioral change.","Legate, Nicole; Weinstein, Netta",Health Commun,,571

We report here cryo-electron microscopy structures of the full-length spike (S) trimers of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants, as well as their biochemical and antigenic properties. Amino acid substitutions in the B.1.1.7 protein increase both the accessibility of its receptor binding domain and the binding affinity for receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The enhanced receptor engagement may account for the increased transmissibility. The B.1.351 variant has evolved to reshape antigenic surfaces of the major neutralizing sites on the S protein, making it resistant to some potent neutralizing antibodies. These findings provide structural details on how SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to enhance viral fitness and immune evasion.","Cai, Yongfei; Zhang, Jun; Xiao, Tianshu; Lavine, Christy L; Rawson, Shaun; Peng, Hanqin; Zhu, Haisun; Anand, Krishna; Tong, Pei; Gautam, Avneesh; Lu, Shen; Sterling, Sarah M; Walsh, Richard M; Rits-Volloch, Sophia; Lu, Jianming; Wesemann, Duane R; Yang, Wei; Seaman, Michael S; Chen, Bing",Science,,571

First, this article aims to exemplify significant aspects regarding test procedures. Subsequently the different systems for recording laboratory tests are described and test numbers from the RKI test laboratory query and the laboratory-based SARS-CoV­2 surveillance as well as accounting data from the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians for SARS-CoV­2 laboratory tests are shown.Early in the pandemic, the RKI test laboratory query and the laboratory-based SARS-CoV­2 surveillance became available and able to evaluate data on performed tests and test capacities. By recording the positive and negative test results, statements about the total number of tests and the proportion of positive test rates can be made. While the aggregate test numbers are largely representative nationwide, they are not always representative at the state and district level. The billing data of the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians can complement the laboratory data afterwards. In addition, it can provide a retrospective assessment of the total number of SARS-CoV­2 numbers in Germany, because the services provided by statutory health insurers (around 85% of the population in Germany) are included. The various laboratory data recording systems complement one another and the evaluations flow into the recommended measures for the pandemic response.","Seifried, Janna; Hoffmann, Alexandra; Reda, Sarah; Böttcher, Sindy; Abu Sin, Muna; Hofmann, Alexandra; Noll, Ines; von Laer, Anja; Reuss, Annicka; Oh, Djin-Ye; Albrecht, Stefan; Stern, Daniel; Willrich, Niklas; Staat, Doreen; Zacher, Benedikt; Schneider, Marc; Feig, Marcel; Nitsche, Andreas; Rieck, Thorsten; Rexroth, Ute; Eckmanns, Tim; Hamouda, Osamah",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,,571

Although they work with diverse populations, there is a lack of literature on culturally competent education during an emergency such as a pandemic. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness of an online education programme aimed at increasing cultural competence among rescue teams and healthcare professionals facing the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Pre-post-web-based intervention study. METHODS: Pre-post-intervention surveys were administered to a matched sample of Israeli healthcare and rescue organisation professionals. The initial sample included 303 participants (52% women) who completed the pre-intervention survey. More than half of the sample (56%, n = 170) were paid workers or volunteers in health organisations. Of the initial sample, 154 participants completed the post-intervention survey following the online cultural competence education programme. Descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis were used to evaluate participants' gains in culturally competent attitudes, knowledge, skills and encounters. This study followed the STROBE guidelines. RESULTS: Participants found the online programme useful in improving their cultural competence during the COVID-19 pandemic. The highest gains were found in the attitudes domains, whereas the lowest in the knowledge domain. Pre-intervention cultural competence scores and incorporating the programme in the educational curricula predicted increased gains in cultural competence. CONCLUSIONS: Online educational interventions showed potential for increasing professionals' awareness of cultural biases, differences and attitudes, leading to more open and accepting attitudes towards patients of different backgrounds. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Recognising the need for real-time, low-cost and available training, the World Health Organization recommended using online courses for healthcare professionals struggling in the pandemic frontline. Online education programmes provide a useful platform for training health professionals in times of emergency.","Slobodin, Ortal; Kula, Yosef; Clempert, Neta; Cohen, Odeya",J. clin. nurs,,571

On this basis, we specify our formal language and present a respective, fully implemented toolkit around it. We then evaluate the practical applicability of our language and toolkit and demonstrate the additional prospects it unlocks through two different use cases: a) the inter-organizational analysis of personal data-related practices allowing, for instance, to uncover data sharing networks based on explicitly announced transparency information and b) the presentation of formally represented transparency information to users through novel, more comprehensible, and potentially adaptive user interfaces, heightening data subjects' actual informedness about data-related practices and, thus, their sovereignty. Altogether, our transparency information language and toolkit allow - differently from previous work - to express transparency information in line with actual legal requirements and practices of modern (web) information systems engineering and thereby pave the way for a multitude of novel possibilities to heighten transparency and user sovereignty in practice.","Grunewald, Elias; Pallas, Frank",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.10431v1.pdf,571

358135,Roles of genetics and blood type in clinical responses to COVID-19: ethical and policy concerns,2020,"BACKGROUND: Sensitive, rapid, and accessible diagnostics continue to be critical to track the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. RT-qPCR is the gold standard test, and comparison of methodologies and reagents, utilizing patient samples, is important to establish reliable diagnostic pipelines. METHODS: Here, we assessed indirect methods that require RNA extraction with direct RT-qPCR on patient samples. Four different RNA extraction kits (Qiagen, Invitrogen, BGI and Norgen Biotek) were compared. For detection, we assessed two recently developed Taqman-based modules (BGI and Norgen Biotek), a SYBR green-based approach (NEB Luna Universal One-Step Kit) with published and newly-developed primers, and clinical results (Seegene STARMag RNA extraction system and Allplex 2019-nCoV RT-qPCR assay). We also tested and optimized direct, extraction-free detection using these RT-qPCR systems and performed a cost analysis of the different methods evaluated here. RESULTS: Most RNA isolation procedures performed similarly, and while all RT-qPCR modules effectively detected purified viral RNA, the BGI system provided overall superior performance (lower detection limit, lower Ct values and higher sensitivity), generating comparable results to original clinical diagnostic data, and identifying samples ranging from 65 copies to 2.1 × 105 copies of viral genome/µl. However, the BGI detection system is more expensive than other options tested here. With direct RT-qPCR, simply adding an RNase inhibitor greatly improved detection, without the need for any other treatments (e.g. lysis buffers or boiling). The best direct methods detected ~ 10 fold less virus than indirect methods, but this simplified approach reduced sample handling, as well as assay time and cost. CONCLUSIONS: With extracted RNA, the BGI RT-qPCR detection system exhibited superior performance over the Norgen system, matching initial clinical diagnosis with the Seegene Allplex assay. The BGI system was also suitable for direct, extraction-free analysis, providing 78.4% sensitivity. The Norgen system, however, still accurately detected samples with a clinical Ct < 33 from extracted RNA, provided significant cost savings, and was superior to SYBR green assays that exhibited reduced specificity.","Pearson, Joel D; Trcka, Daniel; Lu, Suying; Hyduk, Sharon J; Jen, Mark; Aynaud, Marie-Ming; Hernández, J Javier; Peidis, Philippos; Barrios-Rodiles, Miriam; Chan, Kin; Woodgett, Jim; Mazzulli, Tony; Attisano, Liliana; Pelletier, Laurence; Cybulsky, Myron I; Wrana, Jeffrey L; Bremner, Rod",Virol J,,571

358828,The COVID-19 epidemic in madrid: Chronicle of a challenge,2020,"BACKGROUND: To investigate any associations between new clinical policies implemented because of the COVID-19 pandemic and harm to patients. METHODS: Retrospective data collection of incidents and complaints reported through Datix®, and the Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS), respectively. The setting was the Family Health division in a University teaching hospital in the UK. Primary and secondary outcome measures included: the proportion of incidents reported on Datix® from 23 March 2020 to 29 May 2020, compared to the period from 23 March 2019 to 29 May 2019. COVID-19 related incidents and complaints and association with newly published guidelines or pathways from 23 March 2020 to 29 May 2020 were investigated. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the proportion of overall patient activity resulting in incidents reported on Datix in 2020 (2.08%) compared to 2019 (2.09%), with 98% resulting in no/low harm in 2020. Three incident categories had increases in relative proportions of incidents including the terms ""COVID"" or ""Corona"" compared to incidents that did not: ""Child death"", ""delay/failure to treatment and procedure"" and ""information governance"". One of the child deaths was a miscarriage and we were unable to link the second child death to a change in clinical policy at this stage. We were only able to link two COVID-19 associated incidents with a pathway or procedural change (one to the Children's Emergency Department admission pathway and the second to the introduction of virtual antenatal clinics). Eighteen complaints related to COVID-19 were logged. However, at this stage, we are unable to link any of these to a published change in clinical policy. CONCLUSIONS: New policies introduced in the division, during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with similar rates of clinical incidents, when compared with the previous year. There were only two COVID-19-related incidents clearly related to a change in pathways and procedures. Continued surveillance and improved metrics for monitoring the impact of changes to pathways and procedures should be sought with the sustained presence of COVID-19 in clinical areas.","Atiomo, William; Weir, Peter; Kean, Lucy",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,571

360713,Remote Respiratory Monitoring in the Time of COVID-19,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite its crucial role in protection against viral infections, mucosal immunity has been largely understudied in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This review outlines the current evidence about the role of mucosal immune responses in the clearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, as well as potential mucosal mechanisms of protection against (re-)infection. RECENT FINDINGS: The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 cellular entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is most highly expressed in the upper respiratory tract and most SARS-CoV-2 shedding occurs from the upper respiratory tract. Viral shedding peaks early during infection around the onset of symptoms, before dropping rapidly in most individuals within 7âdays of symptom onset, suggesting mucosal inhibition of viral infection. Serum and mucosal immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M responses were found to be strongly correlated in infected patients, whereas correlations were much weaker for immunoglobulin A (IgA). Mucosal IgA responses have been detected in infected cases in the absence of serum antibody responses, with mucosal antibody levels correlating strongly with virus neutralization. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage samples of COVID-19 patients revealed the induction of mucosal chemokine and cytokine genes, complement pathways, Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription signaling and cytotoxic T cells. SUMMARY: Although most clinical studies focus on antibodies and cellular immunity in peripheral blood, mucosal immune responses in the respiratory tract play a key role in the early restriction of viral replication and the clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Identification of mucosal biomarkers associated with viral clearance will allow monitoring of infection-induced immunity. Further studies are needed to understand how the systemic immunological endpoints measured in vaccination studies translate to mucosal protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Fröberg, Janeri; Diavatopoulos, Dimitri A",Curr Opin Infect Dis,,571
360736,Resilience and Meaning-Making Amid the COVID-19 Epidemic in China,2020,"Purpose: C5&#945; receptor 1 (C5&#913;R1) is associated with the development of various human cancers. However, whether it is involved in the development of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is poorly understood. We explored the expression, biological role, and associated mechanisms of C5AR1 in HBV-related hepatoma cells. Materials and Methods: The expression of C5&#913;R1 mediated by HBV and HBV core protein (HBc) was detected in hepatoma cells. The function of nuclear factor ÐºB (NF-&#954;B) pathway in HBc-induced C5AR1 expression was assessed. The roles of C5&#913;R1 in the activation of intracellular signal pathways, the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, and the growth and migration of hepatoma cells mediated by HBc, were investigated. The effect of C5&#945; in the development of HCC mediated by C5AR1 was also measured. Results: C5&#913;R1 expression was increased in HBV-positive hepatoma cells. Dependent on HBc, HBV enhanced the expression of C5&#913;R1 at the mRNA and protein levels. Besides, HBc could promote C5&#913;R1 expression via the NF-&#954;B pathway. Based on the C5&#913;R1, HBc facilitated the activation of JNK and ERK pathways and the expression and secretion of interleukin-6 in hepatoma cells. Furthermore, C5&#913;R1 was responsible for enhancing the growth and migration of hepatoma cells mediated by HBc. Except these, C5&#945; could promote the malignant development of HBc-positive HCC via C5AR1. Conclusion: We provide new insight into the mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis mediated by HBc. C5&#913;R1 has a significant role in the functional abnormality of hepatoma cells mediated by HBc, and might be utilized as a potential therapeutic target for HBV-related HCC.","Kong, Fanyun; Tao, Yukai; Yuan, Dongchen; Zhang, Ning; Li, Qi; Yu, Tong; Yang, Xiaoying; Kong, Delong; Ding, Xiaohui; Liu, Xiangye; You, Hongjuan; Zheng, Kuiyang; Tang, Renxian",,,571
361180,Analyzing Social Distancing and Seasonality of COVID-19 with Mean Field Evolutionary Dynamics,2020,"The objective of the study was to investigate and quantify the severity of COVID-19 infection by high resolution computed tomography (CT) of chest and to determine its relationship with clinical parameters. This study also aimed to see CT changes with clinical recovery or progression of disease. This cross sectional study was performed from July 20 to August 20, 2020, where both chest HRCT and clinical features were included in laboratory confirmed COVID-19, 100 patients, attending the depertment of Radiology & Imaging, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh. This study included clinical symptoms, comorbidities of patients, HRCT chest characteristics, CT severity score. After collection of all required data and careful medical chest review, the clinical data of laboratory confirmed patients was compiled and tabulated. In this study group out of 100 patients, most of the patients were in 5th & 6th dacades with a mean age of 53.7 years. In this study out of 100 patients 72% were male and 28% were female with an average sex ratio of male : female being 2.5:1. Prevalance of various clinical presentation in this study sample population distributed as fever in 76% cough in 77.4%, shortness of breath in 55%, sore throat in 17% were the most common clinical manifestations while a few patients (13.2%) also had other symptoms like headache, chest tightnes, anosmia and diarrhoea. Major comorbid conditions were diabets mellitus, hypertension, bronchial asthma and Chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patient with comorbid disease, especially if multiple had higher symptomatic presentation. Out of 100 patients 75.5% patient had co-morbidity where as 24.5% ptaients did not have any co-existing disease. According to HRCT imaging severity score the lung pathological changes were evaluated, when typical covid findings in 80%, intermediate in 10%, atypical in 2% and normal chest CT findings in 8% patients. Symptomatic presentation had found higher (85.21%) who had CT severity index >15/25 while sympotomatic presentation lesser (14.79%) who had CT severity index <15/25. CT severity index of 1-5 was seen in 20(21.73%) patients, 6-10 in 38(41.30%) patients, 11-15 in 22(23.91% patients, 16-20 in 10(10.86%) patients and 21-25 in 2(2.17%). As positive CT findings were more prominent in symptomatic and co-morbid patients HRCT chest in COVID-19 patient had a major diagnostic and prognostic importance. Clinical symptoms of patients directly correlated with CT severity score. Therefore, CT imaging was found to be useful in predicting clinical recovery of patient or progression of disease.","Islam, M N; Dipi, R M; Mostafa, S N; Datta, A",Mymensingh Med J,,571

Changes in daily living routines, reduction in physical activities, and changes in environmental indicators were suggested to positively impact paediatric asthma indicators in western cultures. Little is known about such impact in developing countries. This study investigated the potential impact of COVID-19 NPI measures on paediatric asthma exacerbation admissions in Northern Jordan. METHODS: Aggregate data from a paediatric hospital, Princess Rahma Pediatric Teaching Hospital, and King Abdulla University Teaching Hospital were utilised from 2018 to 2020. The number of paediatric asthma exacerbation admissions was calculated by week and compared by year, lockdown status, and weeks for lockdown (weeks 13-19). The stringency index was correlated with the number of weekly paediatric asthma exacerbation admissions for 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1,207 paediatric asthma exacerbation admissions were reported; 40.3%, 35.2%, and 24.5% in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The number of weekly admissions ranged from 1 to 13 paediatric asthma cases (mean (SD) = 7.6 (2.7)). In 2018 and 2019, respectively, mean weekly admissions were 9.2 (1.9) and 8.0 (2.0) paediatric asthma cases, while in 2020 the mean was 5.6 (2.7) cases. Significant differences in mean weekly paediatric asthma exacerbation admissions were detected by year, with mean weekly admissions for 2020 being significantly lower than that for 2018 and 2019. During the lockdown (22 March to 1 May 2020), mean weekly admissions (2.6 (1.4)) was significantly lower than that before the lockdown (8.6 (2.0)) and after the lockdown (5.2 (2.0)). For the lockdown weeks only, the mean admissions for the year 2020 was significantly lower than that for years 2019 and 2018. The stringency index negatively correlated with the number of weekly admissions. CONCLUSION: NPI measures in Jordan seem to have positively impacted paediatric asthma exacerbation admissions. Further studies are needed to draw public health policies and fine-tune environmental and community policies.","Alsulaiman, Jomana W; Kheirallah, Khalid A; Ajlony, Mohammed-Jafar; Al-Tamimi, Taha M; Khasawneh, Rawand A; Al-Natour, Lara",Int J Clin Pract,,571
362131,Resilient aspirants: Women's candidacies and election in times of Covid-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze clinical features and genetic cause for a Chinese pedigree affected with microphthalmia. METHODS: The proband and his parents were subjected to whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify potential pathogenic variants. Sanger sequencing was carried out to confirm the result of WES in available members from the pedigree. Prenatal diagnosis was provided to the proband's mother by genetic testing of amnionic DNA. RESULTS: A heterozygous nonsense mutation c.289C>T (p.R97*) was identified in the OTX2 gene among three patients from the pedigree by WES. The result was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The proband's mother has carried the same mutation but did not have microphthalmia. The proband's father, aunt and the mother's fetus did not carry the mutation. CONCLUSION: The c.289C>T (p.R97*) mutation probably underlies the microphthalmia in this pedigree. Above result has facilitated genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis.","Zhang, Qin; Xiang, Jingjing; Yang, Fei; Zhang, Wei; Mao, Jun; Liu, Yinghua; Li, Hong",Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,,571

363181,MP Twitter Abuse in the Age of COVID-19: White Paper,2020-06-10,"Site-specific evolutionary rate shifts are defined as protein sites, where the rate of substitution has changed dramatically across the phylogeny. With respect to a given clade, sites may either undergo a rate acceleration or a rate deceleration, reflecting a site that was conserved and became variable, or vice-versa, respectively. Sites displaying such a dramatic evolutionary change may point to a loss or gain of function at the protein site, reflecting adaptation, or they may indicate epistatic interactions among sites. Here, we analyzed full genomes of HIV and SIV-1 and identified 271 rate-shifting sites along the HIV-1/SIV phylogeny. The majority of rate shifts occurred at long branches, often corresponding to cross-species transmission branches. We noted that in most proteins, the number of rate accelerations and decelerations was equal, and we suggest that this reflects epistatic interactions among sites. However, several accessory proteins were enriched for either accelerations or decelerations, and we suggest that this may be a signature of adaptation to new hosts. Interestingly, the non-pandemic HIV-1 group O clade exhibited a substantially higher number of rate-shift events than the pandemic group M clade. We propose that this may be a reflection of the height of the species barrier between gorillas and humans versus chimpanzees and humans. Our results provide a genome-wide view of the constraints operating on proteins of HIV-1 and SIV.","Gelbart, Maoz; Stern, Adi",Viruses,,571

It is unclear whether patients with seropositivity represent the subgroup with robust health status, who would be more likely to mount a durable antibody response. Using data from a July 2020 sample of 28,503 patients receiving dialysis, we evaluated the cross-sectional association of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity with laboratory surrogates of patient health. In separate logistic regression models, we assessed the association of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity with seven laboratory-based covariates (albumin, creatinine, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone), across the entire range of the laboratory and in comparison to a referent value. Models accounted for age, sex, region, race and ethnicity, and county-level COVID-19 deaths per 100,000. Odds of seropositivity for albumin 3 and 3.5 g/dL were 2.1 (95% CI 1.9-2.3) and 1.3 (1.2-1.4) respectively, compared with 4 g/dL. Odds of seropositivity for serum creatinine 5 and 8 mg/dL were 1.8 (1.6-2.0) and 1.3 (1.2-1.4) respectively, compared with 12.5 mg/dL. Lower values of hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone were associated with higher odds of seropositivity. Laboratory values associated with poorer health status and higher risk for mortality were also associated with higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients receiving dialysis.","Anand, Shuchi; Montez-Rath, Maria E; Han, Jialin; Garcia, Pablo; Bozeman, Julie; Kerschmann, Russell; Beyer, Paul; Parsonnet, Julie; Chertow, Glenn M",PLoS One,,571

While the potential for benefit with the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) and the risks from stopping them is more evident, potential harm by RA&#913;Si may also be caused by the increase in the activity of the ACE2 receptor, the inefficient counter regulatory axis in the lungs in which the proinflammatory prolyloligopeptidase (POP) is the main enzyme responsible for the conversion of deleterious angiotensin (ANG) II to protective ANG [1-7] and the proinflammatory properties of ACE2(+) cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. Acknowledging the proven RA&#913;Si benefit in patients with several diseases such as hypertension, heart failure, coronary disease, and diabetic kidney disease in the non-COVID-19 era, it is a reasonable strategy in this period of uncertainty to use these agents judiciously with careful consideration and to avoid the use of RAASi in select patients whenever possible, until definitive evidence becomes available.","Triposkiadis, Filippos; Starling, Randall C; Xanthopoulos, Andrew; Butler, Javed; Boudoulas, Harisios",Heart fail. rev,,571

364065,Covid-19: £150m worth of masks bought without tender by government are unusable,2020,"Aeromonas hydrophila, a Gram-negative bacterium, causes diseases in fish, resulting in excessive loss to the aquaculture industry. Aeromonas is a highly heterogeneous group of bacteria, and the heterogeneity of the genus is attributed to variation and diversity in the virulence factors and toxins among various Aeromonas strains. One of the major toxins aerolysin, secreted by the bacterium, causes hemorrhagic-septicemia and diarrhea and can serve as a drug target. Here, we describe characterization, molecular phylogeny, and homology modeling of the aerolysin of A. hydrophila strain EUS112 (AhEUS112) cloned in our lab. The encoded aerolysin is 485 amino acids long with an N-terminal signal sequence of 23 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis of the aerolysin of AhEUS112 revealed that it belongs to a diverse group of toxins, showing maximum similarity with aerolysins of other Aeromonas strains followed by Vibrio toxin. The homology model of the mature aerolysin of AhEUS112 was generated using the crystal structure of a mutant aerolysin (PDB#3g4n) as the template, which showed that the encoded aerolysin exists as a channel protein. Validation of the generated model using bioinformatics tool confirmed it to be a good quality model that can be used for drug design. Molecular dock analysis revealed that drugs, aralia-saponin I, cyclamin, ardisiacrispin B, and aralia-saponin II bind to aerolysin with a higher affinity as compared to other drugs and at functionally important amino acids of aerolysin. Hence, these molecules can act as an effective therapeutics for inhibiting the aerolysin pore formation and curtail the severity of Aeromonas infection.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Recently, United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of remdesivir as anti-SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir is a natural product-inspired nucleoside analogue with significant broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Nucleosides analogues from marine sponge including spongouridine and spongothymidine have been used as lead for the evolutionary synthesis of various antiviral drugs such as vidarabine and cytarabine. Furthermore, the marine sponge is a rich source of compounds with unique activities. Marine sponge produces classes of compounds that can inhibit the viral cysteine protease (M-pro) such as esculetin and ilimaquinone and human serine protease (TMPRSS2) such as pseudotheonamide C and D and aeruginosin 98B. Additionally, sponge-derived compounds such as dihydrogracilin A and avarol showed immunomodulatory activity that can target the cytokines storm. Here, we reviewed the potential use of sponge-derived compounds as promising therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Despite the reported antiviral activity of isolated marine metabolites, structural modifications showed the importance in targeting and efficacy. On that basis, we are proposing a novel structure with bifunctional scaffolds and dual pharmacophores that can be superiorly employed in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Hamoda, A. M.; Fayed, B.; Ashmawy, N.

We generate a linear epitope landscape of the Spike protein by analyzing the serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) response of 1,051 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with a peptide microarray. We reveal two regions rich in linear epitopes, i.e., C-terminal domain (CTD) and a region close to the S2' cleavage site and fusion peptide. Unexpectedly, we find that the receptor binding domain (RBD) lacks linear epitope. We reveal that the number of responsive peptides is highly variable among patients and correlates with disease severity. Some peptides are moderately associated with severity and clinical outcome. By immunizing mice, we obtain linear-epitope-specific antibodies; however, no significant neutralizing activity against the authentic virus is observed for these antibodies. This landscape will facilitate our understanding of SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral responses and might be useful for vaccine refinement.","Li, Yang; Ma, Ming-Liang; Lei, Qing; Wang, Feng; Hong, Wei; Lai, Dan-Yun; Hou, Hongyan; Xu, Zhao-Wei; Zhang, Bo; Chen, Hong; Yu, Caizheng; Xue, Jun-Biao; Zheng, Yun-Xiao; Wang, Xue-Ning; Jiang, He-Wei; Zhang, Hai-Nan; Qi, Huan; Guo, Shu-Juan; Zhang, Yandi; Lin, Xiaosong; Yao, Zongjie; Wu, Jiaoxiang; Sheng, Huiming; Zhang, Yanan; Wei, Hongping; Sun, Ziyong; Fan, Xionglin; Tao, Sheng-Ce",Cell Rep,,571

Common characteristics can predispose these patients to the development of severe respiratory illness, which may be particularly relevant during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: A scoping review was performed to assess the impact of pulmonary comorbidities and adverse respiratory outcomes in HNSCC patients. RESULTS: Advanced age, history of tobacco and alcohol abuse, and cardiopulmonary comorbidities are significant risk factors for the development of adverse respiratory outcomes. Treatment toxicities from radiation or chemoradiation therapy significantly increase these risks. CONCLUSION: Respiratory complications are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality among HNSCC patients, and the COVID-19 pandemic may disproportionately affect this population. Interventions designed to decrease smoking and alcohol use, improve oral hygiene, and aggressively manage medical comorbidities are important to the long-term management and health of these patients.","Silverman, Dustin A; Lin, Chen; Tamaki, Akina; Puram, Sidharth V; Carrau, Ricardo L; Seim, Nolan B; Eskander, Antoine; Rocco, James W; Old, Matthew O; Kang, Stephen Y",Head Neck,,571

The presence of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses in Malayan pangolins, in silico analysis of the ACE2 receptor polymorphism and sequence similarities between the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the spike proteins of pangolin and human Sarbecoviruses led to the proposal of pangolin as intermediary. However, the binding affinity of the pangolin ACE2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2 RBD was later on reported to be low. Here, we provide evidence that the pangolin is not the intermediate animal at the origin of the human pandemic. Moreover, data available do not fit with the spillover model currently proposed for zoonotic emergence which is thus unlikely to account for this outbreak.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study among urological HCWs was performed. HCWs were surveyed for anxiety about the pandemic, stress level and current workload, fear of coronavirus infection, current perception of safety at work, and attitude towards protective equipment and tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS: Sixty-three HCWs filled in the questionnaire. Overall anxiety of infection with CO-VID-19 is at a median of 4.7 with no statistically significant difference between nurses and physicians (p = 0.0749). Safety at work reaches a median of 6 out of 10. In fact, the highest fear in 56.7% (31/63) of the personnel is to get infected by a colleague tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing surgical face masks. A proportion of 55.7 and 74.6% highly favor swabs for SARS-CoV-2 on a regular basis in HCWs and patients, respectively (p = 0.0001). Workload in the urology department is clearly reduced during the pandemic (physicians 39.3% vs. nurses 32.2%, p = 0.0001) and 57.4% do not feel distress at all; only 27.9% express mental distress. CONCLUSION: During the pandemic, urology HCWs perceive lower burden by workload and deem themselves at low risk of infection. However, the greatest anxiety is related to infection by a SARS-CoV-2-positive colleague, despite reciprocal protection by surgical face masks. This highlights a relevant mental stress and uncertainty towards management of infected HCWs, calling for increased education and psychological support.","Apfelbeck, Maria; Staehler, Michael; Rodler, Severin; Stredele, Regina; Chaloupka, Michael; Mumm, Jan-Niclas; Buchner, Alexander; Stief, Christian; Casuscelli, Jozefina",Urol Int,,571

The sex, age, and cardiometabolic comorbidities have been considered risk factors for disease severity. To evaluate the association between risk factors with death as well the risk of death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: The present cross-sectional cohort study, includes hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases. Data analysis was performed using the National COVID-19 Cases Report Database. Pearson's c2 test and odds ratios (95% CI) were calculated to determine the association between variables. Thereafter, risk of death was evaluated by Cox proportional hazards model. Results: A total of 67 328 inpatients were included;mean age 55.29 years (±15.97). Of total, 42 164 (62.62%) were men, 6 349 (9.43%) were intubated, and 23 873 (35.46%) died. Male sex, age older than 60 years, and cardiometabolic comorbidities were associated with death. Hazard ratio for death in older intubated patients was lower than in non-intubated (HR 1.242, 95%CI, 1.167e1.322;P &lt;0.001) and (HR 2.128, 95%CI, 2.066e2.193;P &lt;0.001) respectively. Conclusions: Tracheal intubation or not is the most important predictor for death in COVID-19 infected patients in this Mexican cohort.

369523,Alternative fuel market after Covid-19-focus on efficiency and quality,2020,"Although people with schizophrenia (PSZ) exhibit robust and reliable deficits in working memory (WM) capacity, the neural processes that give rise to this impairment remain poorly understood. One reason for this lack of clarity is that most studies employ a single neural recording modality-each with strengths and weaknesses-with few examples of integrating results across modalities. To address this gap, we conducted a secondary analysis that combined data from an overlapping set of subjects in previously published electroencephalographic and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies that used nearly identical working memory tasks (visual change detection). The prior studies found similar patterns of results for both posterior parietal BOLD activation and suppression of the alpha frequency band within the EEG. Specifically, both signals exhibited abnormally shallow modulation as a function of the amount of information being stored in WM in PSZ. In the present study, both alpha suppression and posterior parietal BOLD activity increased as the number of items stored in WM increased. The magnitude of alpha suppression modulation was correlated with the magnitude of BOLD signal modulation in PSZ, but not in HCS. This finding suggests that the same illness-related biological processes constrain both alpha suppression and BOLD signal modulation as a function of WM storage in PSZ. The complementary strengths of these two techniques may thus combine to advance the identification of the processes underlying WM deficits in PSZ.","Erickson, Molly A; Hahn, Britta; Kiat, John E; Alliende, Luz Maria; Luck, Steven J; Gold, James M",Schizophr Res,,571

There are different task variants, e.g., stance of a tweet vs. a full article, or stance with respect to a claim vs. an (implicit) topic. Moreover, task definitions vary, which includes the label inventory, the data collection, and the annotation protocol. All these aspects hinder cross-domain studies, as they require changes to standard domain adaptation approaches. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of 16 stance detection datasets, and we explore the possibility for cross-domain learning from them. Moreover, we propose an end-to-end unsupervised framework for out-of-domain prediction of unseen, user-defined labels. In particular, we combine domain adaptation techniques such as mixture of experts and domain-adversarial training with label embeddings, and we demonstrate sizable performance gains over strong baselines, both (i) in-domain, i.e., for seen targets, and (ii) out-of-domain, i.e., for unseen targets. Finally, we perform an exhaustive analysis of the cross-domain results, and we highlight the important factors influencing the model performance.","Hardalov, Momchil; Arora, Arnav; Nakov, Preslav; Augenstein, Isabelle",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07467v2.pdf,571

The purpose of this paper was to find out the impact of migrant population on the epidemic, aiming to provide data support and suggestions for control measures in various epidemic areas. Generalized additive model was utilized to model the relationship between migrant population and the cumulative number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. The difference of spatial distribution was analyzed through spatial autocorrelation and hot spot analysis. Generalized additive model demonstrated that the cumulative number of confirmed cases was positively correlated with migration index and population density. The predictive results showed that, if no travel restrictions are imposed on the migrant population as usual, this number of COVID-19 would have reached 27,483 (95% CI 16,074, 48,097; the actual number was 23,177). The increase in one city (Jian) would be 577.23% (95% CI 322.73%, 972.73%) compared with the real confirmed cases of COVID-19. The average increase in 73 cities was 85.53% (95% CI 19.53%, 189.81%). Among the migration destinations, the number of cases in cities of Hubei province, Chongqing, and Beijing was relatively high, and there were large-scale high-prevalence clusters in eastern Hubei province. Without restrictions on migration, the high prevalence areas in Hubei province and its surrounding areas will be further expanded. The reduced population mobility and population density can greatly slow down the spread of the epidemic. All epidemic areas should suspend the transportation between cities, strictly control the population travel, and decrease the population density, so as to reduce the spread of COVID-19.","Han, Lizhen; Jia, Jinzhu",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

371589,"Sustaining Normative Horizons, Grappling with Elusive Effects: Governance and Sociality Under the Litmus Test of COVID-19",2021,"In 2019, a new virus -SARS-COV2 emerged in china which infected many people affecting mainly the respiratory system. SARS-COV2 gets transmitted by inhalation of droplets from infected persons. Symptoms start to appear after the incubation period of the virus which ranges from 2 to 14 days. In most people, symptoms are usually mild such as fever, sore throat, cough, chest tightness and fatigue. In other people, the disease might progress into severe pneumonia leading to several fatal consequences. Treatment is usually supportive and the role of antiviral is not established yet. Home isolation for mild cases is important for the prevention of the transmission of infection. Although the rate of transmission of this virus is faster than other viruses from the family such as MERS-CoV, it has a lower fatality rate. The main difference in the genome structure of this family which make it distinguishable from other viruses is its use of (+) ssRNA as its genetic material which is comprised of 5' cap located at one end and 3' polyadenylation tract at the other end. During infection of an exposed host cell, viral-encoded protease cleaves the polyprotein that results from translation of 5' open reading frame (ORF) of the genome, culminating in releasing of multiple nonstructural proteins such as helicase (Hel), adenosine triphosphate (ATPase) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Rep). These proteins are responsible for the replication process in addition to the syntheses of the sub genomic mRNA used as transcription templet strand. In this review article we discussed the transmission pathways, genetic sequence and current treatment approach of COVID-19.","Al Dhamen, Marwa Abduallah; Alhashim, Abrar Fouad; Alqattan, Hawra Hussain; Pottoo, Faheem Hyder",Curr. pharm. des,,571

BACKGROUND: The increased workload of health care workers in the COVID-19 pandemic affects their job performance, causes medical errors, contributes to patients' mortality and is a major concern for all health care organisations in the world. METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited 139 nurses selected from the ICUs, infectious disease wards and emergency units of two hospitals in Iran. The NASA-Task Load Index and Paterson's job performance questionnaire were used. RESULTS: Mean scores of mental workload and job performance of the nurses were 67.14 ± 30.53 and 37.37 ± 7.36, respectively. A total of 71.95% and 96.4% of the nurses had high mental workload and job performance levels, respectively. The results indicated a weak positive correlation between mental workload and the mean score of job performance(r = .057). Unlike the mental demand (r = .175, p = .04) and temporal demand (r = .307, p < .001) that had a significant positive correlation with job performance, frustration had a significant negative correlation with job performance (r = -.183, p = .032). The following variables explained 33% of the variance of nurses' job performance: age, gender, type of ward, working shift, experience of providing care to patients with COVID-19 and frustration. CONCLUSION: The nurses' mental workload increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the negative effect of mental workload on the nurses' behaviour and performance, the rise in their job performance and its weak positive correlation with their mental workload should be further addressed. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: The present study results support the need for focusing on implementing strategies such as providing social and psychological support to moderate mental workload and improve job performance of nurses who provide care to patients with COVID-19.","Pourteimour, Sima; Yaghmaei, Safura; Babamohamadi, Hassan",J. nurs. manag,,571

373119,COVID-19 and Meatpacking: A Topographic Regression Approach,2020,"PURPOSE: Pathological data of critical ill COVID-19 patients is essential in the search for optimal treatment options. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed postmortem needle core lung biopsies in seven patients with COVID-19 related ARDS. Clinical, radiological and microbiological characteristics are reported together with histopathological findings. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients age ranged from 58 to 83 years, five males and two females were included. Time from hospital admission to death ranged from 12 to 36 days, with a mean of 20 ventilated days. ICU stay was complicated by pulmonary embolism in five patients and positive galactomannan on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in six patients, suggesting COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis. Chest CT in all patients showed ground glass opacities, commonly progressing to nondependent consolidations. We observed four distinct histopathological patterns: acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia, diffuse alveolar damage, fibrosis and, in four out of seven patients an organizing pneumonia. None of the biopsy specimens showed any signs of invasive aspergillosis. CONCLUSIONS: In this case series common late histopathology in critically ill COVID patients is not classic DAD but heterogeneous with predominant pattern of organizing pneumonia. Postmortem biopsy investigations in critically COVID-19 patients with probable COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis obtained no evidence for invasive aspergillosis.","Flikweert, Antine W; Grootenboers, Marco J J H; Yick, David C Y; du Mée, Arthur W F; van der Meer, Nardo J M; Rettig, Thijs C D; Kant, Merijn K M",J Crit Care,,571

373701,Pandemic Uncertainty,2020,"Background: It is anticipated that the fear caused by the possible consequences of Covid-19 virus transmission and the sense of restraint caused by control applications such as quarantine may affect individuals', especially employees' psychological parameters and change their habits. Objectives: The aim of this study is explaining the effect of pandemic conditions and precautionary practices on the psychological parameters and nutritional habits of employees. Methods: In this direction, The SCL-90-R test, which was applied to 400 office workers before the pandemic, was reapplied during the pandemic period and the differences between the psychological symptoms were evaluated statistically. In addition, a mini questionnaire was applied on the change of daily nutritional habits after the pandemic. Results: In the period of pandemic compared to before the pandemic;a definite statistical difference was determined in somatization, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, phobic anxiety, paranoid, and general symptom index symptoms. In addition, an acceptable difference was found for the increase in symptoms of paranoid ideation and obsessive-compulsive, and there was no statistical difference only in symptoms of hostility and psychoticism. In addition, it was found that the majority of the participants experienced a change in their daily eating methods. Conclusion: The increase in almost all of the psychological parameters is not evidence of psychological diseases. However, according to the average results, the parameters closest to evaluation as a problem comply with the observed behaviors in pandemic conditions. The change in nutrition methods is also thought to be a reflection of the psychological factors that changed during the pandemic period. © 2021 Mattioli 1885.

374757,The Accelerated Smart(-ification) of Cities Post-covid-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on nursing practice in intensive care unit and consequently, on workload. OBJECTIVE: To assess the nurse-patient ratio required by COVID-19 patients and to identify the factors that influence nursing in this context. DESIGN: This study was a retrospective observational study that evaluated the ratio using the Nursing Activities Score (NAS). SETTING: Three Belgian French-speaking hospitals, including five ICUs. Patients included COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The study included 95 COVID-19 patients and 1604 non-COVID-19 patients (control group) resulting in 905 and 5453 NAS measures, respectively. The NAS was significantly higher among the COVID-19 patients than in the control group (p = <0.0001). In the COVID-19 group, these higher scores were also observed per shift and uniformly across the three hospitals. COVID-19 patients required more time in the activities of monitoring and titration (&#967;2 = 457.60, p = <0.0001), mobilisation (&#967;2 = 161.21, p = <0.0001), and hygiene (&#967;2 = 557.77, p = <0.0001). Factors influencing nursing time measured by NAS in the COVID-19 patients were age <65 years old (p = 0.23), the use of continuous venovenous hemofiltration (p = 0.002), a high APACHE II score (p = 0.006) and patient death (p = 0.002). A COVID-19 diagnosis was independently associated with an increase in nursing time (OR = 4.8, 95% CI:3.6-6.4). CONCLUSIONS: Patients hospitalised in the ICU due to COVID-19 require significantly more nursing time and need an average ratio of almost 1:1.","Bruyneel, Arnaud; Gallani, Maria-Cécillia; Tack, Jérôme; d039,; Hondt, Alain; Canipel, Sebastien; Franck, Stéphane; Reper, Pascal; Pirson, Magali",Intensive Crit Care Nurs,,571

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of EPPE on ERCP success parameters compared to standard PPE (SPPE). METHODS: ERCP procedures were evaluated retrospectively and ERCP outcomes were compared for similar time periods as before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary outcomes were cannulation time, number of cannulation attempts, cannulation success rate, difficult cannulation rate, undesired pancreatic duct cannulation rate, ERCP-related adverse events, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty ERCP procedures were examined. One hundred and fifty-nine procedures were excluded due to missing data, previous sphincterotomy or altered anatomy. Of the final eligible sample size of 221 ERCPs, 93 were performed using SPPE and 128 were performed under EPPE. Indications of ERCP and demographic parameters were similar between groups. The majority of the ERCP cases included were for benign biliary obstruction of common bile duct stones (88.7%). No significant differences were detected in overall technical success (91.4% vs 92.2%, p = 0.832), cannulation success rates (94.6% vs 96.8%, p = 0.403), cannulation times (median times of both groups were 3 min, p = 0.824), difficult cannulation rates (37.6% vs 33.6%, p = 0.523), undesired pancreatic duct cannulation rates (29% vs 22.7%, p = 0.593), number of cannulation attempts (2.80 vs 2.71, p = 0.731), ERCP-related adverse events (9.7% vs 10.9%, p = 0.762), and length of hospital stay (6.63 vs 6.92 days, p = 0.768) between SPPE and EPPE groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Biliary obstructions of common bile duct stones were the major indication of ERCP in the current study. The use of EPPE had no negative effects on ERCP performance in this patient group. ERCP can be effectively performed under EPPE.","Düzenli, Tolga; Köseoglu, Hüseyin",Dig. dis. sci,,571

These devices are either CPUs or GPUs with advanced processing deep and machine learning (artificial intelligence) algorithms that assist in classification and triage solutions to flag studies as either normal or abnormal, TB or healthy (in case of TB screening), suspected COVID-19/other pneumonia or unremarkable (in hospital or hotspot settings). These can be deployed as screening point-of-care (PoC) solutions; this is particularly true for digital and portable X-ray devices. Edge device learning can also be used for mammography and CT studies where it can identify microcalcification and stroke, respectively. These solutions can be considered the first line of pre-screening before the imaging specialist actually reviews scans and makes a final diagnosis. The key advantage of these tools is that they are instant, can be deployed remotely where experts are not available to perform pre-screening before the experts actually review, and are not limited by internet bandwidth as the nano learning data centers are placed next to the device.","Kharat, Amit; Duddalwar, Vinay; Saoji, Krishna; Gaikwad, Ashrika; Kulkarni, Viraj; Naik, Gunjan; Lokwani, Rohit; Kasliwal, Swaraj; Kondal, Sudeep; Gupte, Tanveer; Pant, Aniruddha",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13808v1.pdf,571

375936,How successful countries are in promoting digital transactions during COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Uganda has a unique set up comprised of resource-constrained economy, social-economic challenges, politically diverse regional neighborhood and home to long-standing refuge crisis that comes from long and protracted conflicts of the great lakes. The devastation of the on-going global pandemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is likely to be escalated by these circumstances with expectations of the impact of the disease being severe. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we formulate a mathematical model that incorporates the currently known disease characteristics and tracks various intervention measures that the government of Uganda has implemented since the reporting of the first case in March 2020. We then evaluate these measures to understand levels of responsiveness and adherence to standard operating procedures and quantify their impact on the disease burden. Novel in this model was the unique aspect of modeling the trace-and-isolate protocol in which some of the latently infected individuals tested positive while in strict isolation centers thereby reducing their infectious period. RESULTS: The study findings show that even with elimination of all imported cases at any given time it would take up to nine months to rid Uganda of the disease. The findings also show that the optimal timing of easing of lockdowns while mitigating the possibility of re-emergence of a second epidemic wave requires avoiding the scenario of releasing too-many-too-soon. It is even more worrying that enhancing contact tracing would only affect the magnitude and timing of the second wave but cannot prevent it altogether. CONCLUSION: We conclude that, given the prevailing circumstances, a phased-out lifting of lockdown measures, minimization of COVID-19 transmissibility within hospital settings, elimination of recruitment of infected individuals as well as enhanced contact tracing would be key to preventing overwhelming of the healthcare system that would come with dire consequences.","Mugisha, Joseph Y T; Ssebuliba, Joseph; Nakakawa, Juliet N; Kikawa, Cliff R; Ssematimba, Amos",PLoS One,,571

Currently, it is one of the major threats to humanity. Moreover, any specific drug or vaccine unavailability against COVID-19 forces to discover a new drug on an urgent basis. Viral cycle inhibition could be one possible way to prevent the further genesis of this viral disease, which can be contributed by drug repurposing techniques or screening of small bioactive natural molecules against already validated targets of COVID-19. The main protease (Mpro) responsible for producing functional proteins from polyprotein is an important key step for SARS-CoV-2 virion replication. Natural product or herbal based formulations are an important platform for potential therapeutics and lead compounds in the drug discovery process. Therefore, here we have screened >53,500 bioactive natural molecules from six different natural product databases against Mpro (PDB ID: 6LU7) of COVID-19 through computational study. Further, the top three molecules were subjected to pharmacokinetics evaluation, which is an important factor that reduces the drug failure rate. Moreover, the top three screened molecules (C00014803, C00006660, ANLT0001) were further validated by a molecular dynamics study under a condition similar to the physiological one. Relative binding energy analysis of three lead molecules indicated that C00014803 possess highest binding affinity among all three hits. These extensive studies can be a significant foundation for developing a therapeutic agent against COVID-19 through vet lab studies.","Gupta, Shiv Shankar; Kumar, Ashwani; Shankar, Ravi; Sharma, Upendra",J Mol Graph Model,,571

To realize a patient-oriented education in the block training ""Internal Medicine"" at the University Hospital Halle (Saale) despite the challenges, the already established teaching module ""Interprofessional Teleconsultation"" was adapted. The short article outlines the interprofessional teaching module including first evaluation results and describes the adapted block training. Method: In the ""Internal Medicine"" block training, students in a lecture hall navigated a telepresence system, which was accompanied by a physician across the ward and conducted an anamnesis via video and audio transmission without actual patient contact. Results: Students, physicians, and patients were open-minded about this form of communication during the Covid-19 pandemic and quickly got accustomed to the use of the telepresence system. To be able to react to technical challenges (e.g. unstable connection between the communication partners), a careful preparation of the lecturers is necessary. Conclusion: In using a telepresence system, patient-oriented teaching of students in the block training ""Internal Medicine"" can be ensured with low-threshold technical effort during the Covid-19 pandemic. The telepresence system allows for the involvement of patients into teaching while adhering to the necessary hygiene measures. Despite technical challenges, the teaching format based on telepresence is suitable as an alternative to face-to-face teaching if actual patient contact is not possible.","Haucke, Elisa; Walldorf, Jens; Ludwig, Christiane; Buhtz, Christian; Stoevesandt, Dietrich; Clever, Katharina",GMS J Med Educ,,571

378191,The Challenges Wrought by COVID-19,2020,"COVID-19 has caused thousands of deaths around the world and also resulted in a large international economic disruption. Identifying the pathways associated with this illness can help medical researchers to better understand the properties of the condition. This process can be carried out by analyzing the medical records. It is crucial to develop tools and models that can aid researchers with this process in a timely manner. However, medical records are often unstructured clinical notes, and this poses significant challenges to developing the automated systems. In this article, we propose a pipeline to aid practitioners in analyzing clinical notes and revealing the pathways associated with this disease. Our pipeline relies on topological properties and consists of three steps: 1) pre-processing the clinical notes to extract the salient concepts, 2) constructing a feature space of the patients to characterize the extracted concepts, and finally, 3) leveraging the topological properties to distill the available knowledge and visualize the result. Our experiments on a publicly available dataset of COVID-19 clinical notes testify that our pipeline can indeed extract meaningful pathways.","Karisani, Negin; Platt, Daniel E.; Basu, Saugata; Parida, Laxmi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07417v1.pdf,571

Activated CD8+ T-cells (CD38+ and HLA-DR+) were compared among HIV- (N=95), HIV+/cART experienced (N=111) and HIV+/cART naïve (N=21) pregnant women. Immune activation was highest among HIV+/cART naïve women but decreased during pregnancy. HIV+ women who started cART during pregnancy reduced immune activation but not to levels similar to HIV- women. The effects of elevated maternal immune activation in pregnancy on subsequent infant health and immunity remain to be determined.","Lohman-Payne, Barbara; Koster, Jacob; Gabriel, Benjamin; Chilengi, Roma; Forman, Leah S; Heeren, Tim; Duffy, Cassandra R; Herlihy, Julie; Crimaldi, Steven; Gill, Chris; Chavuma, Roy; Mwananyanda, Lawrence; Thea, Donald M",J. infect. dis,,571

METHODS: A cross-sectional on-line survey was distributed to employees of a major health care institution located in São Paulo, Brazil between April 3 and April 10, 2020. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The sample comprised 2,646 respondents. Most participants (44.4%) reported excessive or almost excessive access to information about the novel coronavirus and 67.6% reported having increased their average time spent on social media. When asked how frequently they consider it was easy to determine the reliability of information, ""sometimes"" corresponded to 43.2% of the answers in contrast to 14.6% responding ""always"". Answers related to potential signs of information overload associated with the pandemic indicated that 31% of respondents felt stressed by the amount of information they had to keep up with almost every day or always. Overall, 80.0% of respondents reported having experienced at least one of the following symptoms: headache, eye twitching, restlessness or sleeping difficulty. The frequency of symptoms was higher among participants with a more negative information processing style regarding when dealing with large volumes of information relative to those with a positive information processing style. Likewise, symptoms were more frequently reported by participants who had increased their social media access relative to those reporting reduced access during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Our survey provides a description of how health professionals consume COVID-19 related information during the pandemic, and suggests that excessive information exposure and high processing demands may impose psychological distress and affect mental health.","Bazán, Paulo Rodrigo; Azevedo Neto, Raymundo Machado de; Dias, Julia Abou; Salvatierra, Vanessa Gil; Sanches, Liana Guerra; Lacerda, Shirley Silva; Amaro Junior, Edson; Kozasa, Elisa Harumi; Balardin, Joana Bisol",Einstein (Sao Paulo),,571

The damage caused by oxidation of guanine, commonly referred to as oxidative guanine damage, results in the formation of several products, including 2,5-diamino-4H-imidazol-4-one (Iz), 2,2,4-triamino-5(2H)-oxazolone (Oz), guanidinoformimine (Gf), guanidinohydantoin/iminoallantoin (Gh/Ia), spiroiminodihydantoin (Sp), 5-carboxamido-5-formamido-2-iminohydantoin (2Ih), urea (Ua), 5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole (NI), spirodi(iminohydantoin) (5-Si and 8-Si), triazine, the M+7 product, other products by peroxynitrite, alkylated guanines, and 8,5'-cyclo-2'-deoxyguanosine (cG). Herein, we summarize the present knowledge about base pairs containing the products of oxidative guanine damage and guanine. Of these products, Iz is involved in G-C transversions. Oz, Gh/Ia, and Sp form preferably Oz:G, Gh/Ia:G, and Sp:G base pairs in some cases. An involvement of Gf, 2Ih, Ua, 5-Si, 8-Si, triazine, the M+7 product, and 4-hydroxy-2,5-dioxo-imidazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (HICA) in G-C transversions requires further experiments. In addition, we describe base pairs that target the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of RNA viruses and describe implications for the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2): When products of oxidative guanine damage are adapted for the ribonucleoside analogs, mimics of oxidative guanine damages, which can form base pairs, may become antiviral agents for SARS-CoV-2.","Kino, Katsuhito; Kawada, Taishu; Hirao-Suzuki, Masayo; Morikawa, Masayuki; Miyazawa, Hiroshi",Int. j. mol. sci.

In this article, we relate our experiences since the COVID-19 crisis to the lessons we have learned over time as mental health professionals working with families in no-cost, student-managed community comprehensive health clinics in academic-community partnerships. We compare and contrast the learnings of flexibility of time, space, procedures, or attendance we acquired in this clinical community setting during regular times, with the new challenges families and therapists face, and the adaptations needed to continue to work with our clients in culturally responsive and empowering ways during the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe families, students, professionals, promotoras (community links), and IT support staff joining together in solidarity as the creative problem solvers of new possibilities when families do not have access to Wi-Fi, smartphones, or computers, or suffer overcrowding and lack of privacy. We describe many anxieties related to economic insecurity or fear of facing death alone, but also how to visualize expanding possibilities in styles of parenting or types of emotional support among family members as elements of hope that may endure beyond these unprecedented tragic times of loss and uncertainty.","Falicov, Celia; Niño, Alba; D039,; Urso, Sol",Fam Process,,571

Although these left-leaning respondents initially increased their media consumption at the outset of the pandemic, they soon complained of media sensationalism and repurposed a readily available cultural tool: claims of “fake news.” As a result, these unsettled times have resulted in a “diffusion of distrust,” in which an elite conservative discourse of skepticism toward the media has also become a popular form of compensatory control among self-identified liberals. Perceiving “fake news” and media sensationalism as “not good” for their mental health, respondents also reported experiencing media burnout and withdrawing from media consumption.

Exploring Uncertainties in the Age-VSL Relationship,2020,"BACKGROUND: Even though SARS-CoV-2 is a predominantly respiratory virus, several reports have described various neurological disorders, from the beginning of the pandemic. The first para-infectious myelitis case was described in Wuhan in February 2020. Nevertheless, data from registries and reviews are scarce. METHODS: A 40-year-old female with T5-T6 SARS-CoV-2 para-infectious myelitis is reported. A literature review of the published literature on the SARS-CoV-2 and para-infectious myelitis was done. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, image, treatment, and outcome data are described. RESULTS: Particular findings of our case are that Covid-19 was asymptomatic and anti-GD2/GD3 IgM was found. 18 para-infectious myelitis occurred over a wide age range (Beh et al., 2013-67), mean age 50.7±18.6 years, with 10/18 (55.6%) women. Covid-19 involvement was variable from asymptomatic cases to severe Covid-19 resulting in death. The mean time to establish myelitis from the onset of Covid-19 symptoms was 10.3 ±7.8 days (0-24). The most common clinical form was transverse myelitis (14/18 patients, 77.7%) and the most frequent radiological form was longitudinally extensive myelitis (11/17 patients, 64.7%). In CSF mild lymphocytosis (14/16, 87.5%) with low cellularity (40.9±49.7/µL) and elevated proteins (11/16, 77.8%, mean 145.0 mg±159.0/dL) were frequent. Oligoclonal bands were usually negative (7/9, 77.7%) and mirror pattern was found in 2/7 patients (33.3%). SARS-CoV-2 PCR in CSF was negative in 10/10 cases. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 can cause myelitis by immune-mediated mechanisms. Clinical-radiological characteristics of Covid-19 para-infectious myelitis were variable and non-specific.","Rodríguez de Antonio, Luis Alberto; González-Suárez, Inés; Fernández-Barriuso, Inés; Rabasa Pérez, María",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,571

At present, whether COVID-19 has an effect on thyroid function is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate thyroid function in patients with COVID-19. Methods: Clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography scans were retrospectively reviewed for 50 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without a history of thyroid disease who underwent thyroid function testing during their course of COVID-19 infection and after recovery. They were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, between January and March 2020. Healthy participants who underwent routine physical checkups and non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients with a similar degree of severity during the same period were included in the study as the control group. Thyroid hormone and thyrotropin (TSH) levels were analyzed and compared between the COVID-19 and control groups. Results: TSH lower than the normal range was present in 56% (28/50) of the patients with COVID-19. The levels of TSH and serum total triiodothyronine (TT3) of the patients with COVID-19 were significantly lower than those of the healthy control group and non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients. The more severe the COVID-19, the lower the TSH and TT3 levels were, with statistical significance (p < 0.001). The degree of the decreases in TSH and TT3 levels was positively correlated with the severity of the disease. The total thyroxine (TT4) level of the patients with COVID-19 was not significantly different from the control group. All the patients did not receive thyroid hormone replacement therapy. After recovery, no significant differences in TSH, TT3, TT4, free triiodothyronine (fT3), and free thyroxine (fT4) levels were found between the COVID-19 and control groups.

We reviewed guidelines from reputable medical sources and generated practical advice to assist practitioners to perform safe and effective video consultation. Additionally, we noted reports in the literature of a lack of transparency and resulting confusion regarding the choice of telemedicine platforms. We, therefore, sought to summarise key characteristics of a number of major telemedicine platforms. We recognised a lack of clarity regarding the legal status of performing remote consultations, and reviewed advice from medico-legal sources. Finally, we address the sources of these individual uncertainties, and give recommendations on how these might be addressed systematically, so the practitioners are well trained and competent in the use of online consultations, which will inevitably play an increasingly large role in both primary and secondary care settings in the future.","Howgego, Gregory; Sharma, Ishta; Kalu, Peter",J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg,,571

METHODS: From 6/24/2020-8/23/2020, Ct values and duration of symptoms from 13 HCW, 12 outpatients, and 28 inpatients who had a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed. RESULTS: Among HCW with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 46.2% (6/13) were asymptomatic and requested testing due to an exposure to someone with COVID-19; 83.3% (5/6) of those exposures occurred in the community rather than in the hospital. The median Ct value of HCW was 23.2, and 84.6% (11/13) had a Ct value &#8804; 34. The median Ct value of 29.0 among outpatients with COVID-19 did not significantly differ from HCW. In contrast, inpatients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test had a median Ct value of 34.0 (p = 0.003), which translated into a median ~1,000-fold lower viral load than observed in HCW. Among those with symptoms related to COVID-19, no (0/6) HCW compared to 50% (6/12) of inpatients had symptoms for at least one week (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: At our institution, asymptomatic COVID-19 accounted for nearly half of the cases among HCW. Symptomatic HCW had high viral loads and short duration of symptoms, both of which are associated with peak infectivity. Infection prevention programs should educate HCW on these findings in an effort to increase adherence to the requirement to maintain six feet separation in workspaces and breakrooms, in addition to consistently wearing personal protection equipment.","McEllistrem, M Catherine; Clancy, Cornelius J; Buehrle, Deanna J; Singh, Nina; Lucas, Aaron; Sirianni, Valerie; Decker, Brooke K",PLoS One,,571

The clinical data of COVID-19 patients from December 2019 to February 2020 were retrieved from four databases. We statistically analyzed the clinical symptoms and laboratory results of COVID-19 patients and explained the discharge rate and fatality rate with a single-arm meta-analysis. The available data of 1994 patients in 10 literatures were included in our study. The main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients were fever (88.5%), cough (68.6%), myalgia or fatigue (35.8%), expectoration (28.2%), and dyspnea (21.9%). Minor symptoms include headache or dizziness (12.1%), diarrhea (4.8%), nausea and vomiting (3.9%). The results of the laboratory showed that the lymphocytopenia (64.5%), increase of C-reactive protein (44.3%), increase of lactic dehydrogenase (28.3%), and leukocytopenia (29.4%) were more common. The results of single-arm meta-analysis showed that the male took a larger percentage in the gender distribution of COVID-19 patients 60% (95% CI [0.54, 0.65]), the discharge rate of COVID-19 patients was 52% (95% CI [0.34,0.70]), and the fatality rate was 5% (95% CI [0.01,0.11]).","Li, Long-Quan; Huang, Tian; Wang, Yong-Qing; Wang, Zheng-Ping; Liang, Yuan; Huang, Tao-Bi; Zhang, Hui-Yun; Sun, Weiming; Wang, Yuping",J Med Virol,,571
382351,Measuring odds of various COVID-19 infection prevention & control measures among the contacts traced during trace test and quarantine activities at district Quetta (An un-matched case control study),2021,"This article surveys the literature on human-robot object handovers. A handover is a collaborative joint action where an agent, the giver, gives an object to another agent, the receiver. The physical exchange starts when the receiver first contacts the object held by the giver and ends when the giver fully releases the object to the receiver. However, important cognitive and physical processes begin before the physical exchange, including initiating implicit agreement with respect to the location and timing of the exchange. From this perspective, we structure our review into the two main phases delimited by the aforementioned events: 1) a pre-handover phase, and 2) the physical exchange. We focus our analysis on the two actors (giver and receiver) and report the state of the art of robotic givers (robot-to-human handovers) and the robotic receivers (human-to-robot handovers). We report a comprehensive list of qualitative and quantitative metrics commonly used to assess the interaction. While focusing our review on the cognitive level (e.g., prediction, perception, motion planning, learning) and the physical level (e.g., motion, grasping, grip release) of the handover, we briefly discuss also the concepts of safety, social context, and ergonomics. We compare the behaviours displayed during human-to-human handovers to the state of the art of robotic assistants, and identify the major areas of improvement for robotic assistants to reach performance comparable to human interactions. Finally, we propose a minimal set of metrics that should be used in order to enable a fair comparison among the approaches.","Ortenzi, Valerio; Cosgun, Akansel; Pardi, Tommaso; Chan, Wesley; Croft, Elizabeth; Kulic, Dana",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12952v1.pdf,571

Unfortunately, an effective drug or vaccine for its treatment is yet to be found. The increasing information available on critical molecular targets of SARS-CoV-2 and active compounds against related coronaviruses facilitates the proposal (or repurposing) of drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19, with the aid of in silico methods. As part of a global effort to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, herein we report a consensus virtual screening of extensive collections of food chemicals and compounds known as dark chemical matter. The rationale is to contribute to global efforts with a description of currently underexplored chemical space regions. The consensus approach included combining similarity searching with various queries and fingerprints, molecular docking with two docking protocols, and ADMETox profiling. We propose compounds commercially available for experimental testing.

Thus far, the studies on andrological consequences of COVID-19 are limited. To ascertain the consequences of COVID-19 on sperm parameters after recovery, we recruited 41 reproductive-aged male patients who had recovered from COVID-19, and analyzed their semen parameters and serum sex hormones at a median time of 56 days after hospital discharge. For longitudinal analysis, a second sampling was obtained from 22 of the 41 patients after a median time interval of 29 days from first sampling. Compared with controls who had not suffered from COVID-19, the total sperm count, sperm concentration, and percentages of motile and progressively motile spermatozoa in the patients were significantly lower at first sampling, while sperm vitality and morphology were not affected. The total sperm count, sperm concentration, and number of motile spermatozoa per ejaculate were significantly increased and the percentage of morphologically abnormal sperm was reduced at the second sampling compared with those at first in the 22 patients examined. Though there were higher prolactin and lower progesterone levels in patients at first sampling than those in controls, no significant alterations were detected for any sex hormones examined over time following COVID-19 recovery in the 22 patients. Although it should be interpreted carefully, these findings indicate an adverse but potentially reversible consequence of COVID-19 on sperm quality.","Guo, Tong-Hang; Sang, Mei-Ying; Bai, Shun; Ma, Hui; Wan, Yang-Yang; Jiang, Xiao-Hua; Zhang, Yuan-Wei; Xu, Bo; Chen, Hong; Zheng, Xue-Ying; Luo, Si-Hui; Xie, Xue-Feng; Gong, Chen-Jia; Weng, Jian-Ping; Shi, Qing-Hua",Asian j. androl,,571

Proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production induced by SARS-CoV-2 were observed not only in symptomatic patients but also in asymptomatic cases, and returned to normal after recovery. IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-18, G-CSF, M-CSF, MCP-1, MCP-3, IP-10, MIG, and MIP-1&#945; were found to be associated with the severity of COVID-19. Moreover, a set of cytokine and chemokine profiles were significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2-infected male than female patients. The serum levels of MCP-1, G-CSF, and VEGF were weakly and positively correlated with viral titers. We suggest that combinatorial analysis of serum cytokines and chemokines with clinical classification may contribute to evaluation of the severity of COVID-19 and optimize the therapeutic strategies.","Chi, Ying; Ge, Yiyue; Wu, Bin; Zhang, Wenshuai; Wu, Tao; Wen, Tian; Liu, Jingxian; Guo, Xiling; Huang, Chao; Jiao, Yongjun; Zhu, Fengcai; Zhu, Baoli; Cui, Lunbiao",J Infect Dis,,571

PURPOSE: The study aimed to get to know opinions of pharmacy staff and owners on the functioning of the community pharmacy during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To collect opinions about functioning of the community pharmacy during the pandemic, we conducted cross-sectional study among pharmacy staff and owners of pharmacies. RESULTS: The study group included 456 respondents mostly associated with independent pharmacies (55.7%), from cities less than 100,000 inhabitants (38.8%). The number of patients as well as filled prescriptions increased during the pandemic. Respondents provided patients with advice on cold (81.6%), sore throat (77.0%) and acherelated complaints (68.6%). Most of participants (64.5%) declared that they informed patients about COVID-19. The safety measures in community pharmacies included: a safety regulations poster during the pandemic (97.1%), handwashing in accordance with recommended guidelines (96.3%) and using protective gloves by the pharmacy staff (89.9%). According to 60.7% of participants, the community pharmacy was properly prepared for the pandemic by the owner, however, respondents from independent pharmacies indicate this more frequently (p=0.0001).

This study aimed primarily to evaluate these hypotheses in a contemporary patient cohort treated with multimodality therapy. METHODS: The clinicopathologic and perioperative characteristics of consecutive resected PDAC patients (July 2011 to October 2018) were analyzed from a prospectively maintained database. Intraoperative administration of dexamethasone (4-10 mg) was retrospectively abstracted from the electronic medical record. RESULTS: The majority of 373 patients (59.8%) received intraoperative dexamethasone. Most of these patients underwent neoadjuvant therapy (75.3%), were potentially resectable at presentation (69.7%), and underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (79.9%). Women were more likely to receive dexamethasone than men (69.9 vs 30.1%; p < 0.001). The cohorts were otherwise clinically similar. Intraoperative dexamethasone was not associated with differences in postoperative major complications (PMCs) (21.1 vs 19.3%; p = 0.68), postoperative pancreatic fistulas (6.3 vs 6.7%; p = 0.88), or composite infectious complications (28.7 vs 24.7%; p = 0.39). Dexamethasone was not associated with any improvement in median recurrence-free survival (RFS) (17 vs 17 months; p = 0.99) or overall survival (OS) (46 vs 43 months; p = 0.90). After adjustment for clinical factors including margin status, clinical classification, tumor size, and dexamethasone, the only factors independently associated with OS were pathologic node-positivity (hazard ratio [HR], 1.80, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-2.47), perineural invasion (HR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.23-3.31), multimodality therapy (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.13-0.70), and PMCs (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.17-2.29) (all p < 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Dexamethasone failed to demonstrate any protective advantage in terms of mitigating short-term PMCs or infectious complications, or to confer any long-term survival benefit.

385157,ICT Keeping COVID-19-Hit Economy Afloat and Spearheading Recovery,2021,"Cases of thrombotic thrombocytopenia induced by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have been reported recently. Herein, we describe the first case of another critical disorder, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), in a healthy individual after COVID-19 vaccination. A 43-year-old Chinese farmer developed malaise, vomiting, and persistent high fever (up to 39.7 °C) shortly after receiving the first dose of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The initial evaluation showed pancytopenia (neutrophil count, 0.70 × 109/L; hemoglobin, 113 g/L; platelet, 27 × 109/L), elevated triglyceride (2.43 mmol/L), and decreased fibrinogen (1.41 g/L). Further tests showed high serum ferritin levels (8140.4 µg/L), low NK cell cytotoxicity (50.13%-60.83%), and positive tests for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA. Hemophagocytosis was observed in the bone marrow. Therefore, HLH was confirmed, and dexamethasone acetate (10 mg/day) was immediately prescribed without etoposide. Signs and abnormal laboratory results resolved gradually, and the patient was discharged. HLH is a life-threatening hyperinflammatory syndrome caused by aberrantly activated macrophages and cytotoxic T cells, which may rapidly progress to terminal multiple organ failure. In this case, HLH was induced by the COVID-19 vaccination immuno-stimulation on a chronic EBV infection background. This report indicates that it is crucial to exclude the presence of active EBV infection or other common viruses before COVID-19 vaccination.","Tang, Liang V; Hu, Yu",J Hematol Oncol,,571

During the COVID-19 pandemic, several Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures have been adopted to reduce nosocomial microorganism transmission. We performed a case-control study to identify if the incidence of MDR bacterial infections while using pandemic-related preventive measures is lower than in previous years. From 2017 to 2020, we monitored hospital discharges over a four-month period (P #) (1 March to 30 June) in St. Andrea Hospital, Rome. In total, we reported 1617 discharges. Pearson's chi-squared test was used to identify significant differences. A value of p &#8804; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A significant reduction in the incidence of total MDR bacterial infections was observed during the pandemic compared to in prepandemic years (p < 0.05). We also found a significantly higher incidence of MDR bacterial infections in COVID-19 departments compared with other medical departments (29% and 19%, respectively), with extended-spectrum ß-lactamase Klebsiella pneumoniae as the pathogens presenting the highest increase. This study demonstrates that maintaining a high level of preventive measures could help tackle an important health problem such as that of the spread of MDR bacteria.","Bentivegna, Enrico; Luciani, Michelangelo; Arcari, Luca; Santino, Iolanda; Simmaco, Maurizio; Martelletti, Paolo",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,571

The purpose of our study was to investigate the impact of surgical masks on F0, jitter, shimmer and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) in adults. Methods: The study was carried out on a selected group of 50 healthy subjects. Voice samples were recorded directly in Praat. All subjects were trained to voice a vocal sample of a sustained /a/, at a conversational voice intensity, with no intensity or frequency variation, for the Maximum Phonation Time (MPT), wearing the surgical mask and then without wearing the surgical mask. Results: None of the variations in acoustic voice analysis detected wearing a surgical mask and not wearing a surgical mask were statistically significant. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that the acoustic voice analysis procedure can continue to be performed with the use of a surgical mask for the patient, even during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cavallaro, Giada; Di Nicola, Vincenzo; Quaranta, Nicola; Fiorella, Maria Luisa",Acta otorhinolaryngol. ital,,571

386960,A New Road Map for Our Nation's Response to COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients are considered at high risk of poor outcomes after COVID-19 on the basis of their immunosuppressed status, but data from large studies in HSCT recipients are lacking. This study describes the characteristics and outcomes of HSCT recipients after developing COVID-19. METHODS: In response to the pandemic, the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) implemented a special form for COVID-19-related data capture on March 27, 2020. All patients-irrespective of age, diagnosis, donor type, graft source, or conditioning regimens-were included in the analysis with data cutoff of Aug 12, 2020. The main outcome was overall survival 30 days after a COVID-19 diagnosis. Overall survival probabilities were calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimator. Factors associated with mortality after COVID-19 diagnosis were examined using Cox proportional hazard models. FINDINGS: 318 HSCT recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 were reported to the CIBMTR. The median time from HSCT to COVID-19 diagnosis was 17 months (IQR 8-46) for allogeneic HSCT recipients and 23 months (8-51) for autologous HSCT recipients. The median follow-up of survivors was 21 days (IQR 8-41) for allogeneic HSCT recipients and 25 days (12-35) for autologous HSCT recipients. 34 (18%) of 184 allogeneic HSCT recipients were receiving immunosuppression within 6 months of COVID-19 diagnosis. Disease severity was mild in 155 (49%) of 318 patients, while severe disease requiring mechanical ventilation occurred in 45 (14%) of 318 patients-ie, 28 (15%) of 184 allogeneic HSCT recipients and 17 (13%) of 134 autologous HSCT recipients. At 30 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19, overall survival was 68% (95% CI 58-77) for recipients of allogeneic HSCT and 67% (55-78) for recipients of autologous HSCT. Age 50 years or older (hazard ratio 2·53, 95% CI 1·16-5·52; p=0·020); male sex (3·53; 1·44-8·67; p=0·006), and development of COVID-19 within 12 months of transplantation (2·67, 1·33-5·36; p=0·005) were associated with a higher risk of mortality among allogeneic HSCT recipients, and a disease indication of lymphoma was associated with a higher risk of mortality compared with plasma cell disorder or myeloma (2·41, [1·08-5·38]; p=0·033) in autologous HSCT recipients. INTERPRETATION: Recipients of autologous and allogeneic HSCT who develop COVID-19 have poor overall survival. These data emphasise the need for stringent surveillance and aggressive treatment measures in HSCT recipients who develop COVID-19.

387515,Telepsychotherapy: a leaflet for psychotherapists in the age of COVID-19. A review of the evidence,2020,"BACKGROUND: A growing number of psychological interventions are delivered via smartphones with the aim of increasing the efficacy and effectiveness of these treatments and providing scalable access to interventions for improving mental health. Most of the scientifically tested apps are based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles, which are considered the gold standard for the treatment of most mental health problems. OBJECTIVE: This review investigates standalone smartphone-based ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) built on principles derived from CBT that aim to improve mental health. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and PubMed databases for peer-reviewed studies published between January 1, 2007, and January 15, 2020. We included studies focusing on standalone app-based approaches to improve mental health and their feasibility, efficacy, or effectiveness. Both within- and between-group designs and studies with both healthy and clinical samples were included. Blended interventions, for example, app-based treatments in combination with psychotherapy, were not included. Selected studies were evaluated in terms of their design, that is, choice of the control condition, sample characteristics, EMI content, EMI delivery characteristics, feasibility, efficacy, and effectiveness. The latter was defined in terms of improvement in the primary outcomes used in the studies. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies were selected. The results show that EMIs based on CBT principles can be successfully delivered, significantly increase well-being among users, and reduce mental health symptoms. Standalone EMIs were rated as helpful (mean 70.8%, SD 15.3; n=4 studies) and satisfying for users (mean 72.6%, SD 17.2; n=7 studies). CONCLUSIONS: Study quality was heterogeneous, and feasibility was often not reported in the reviewed studies, thus limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the existing data. Together, the studies show that EMIs may help increase mental health and thus support individuals in their daily lives. Such EMIs provide readily available, scalable, and evidence-based mental health support. These characteristics appear crucial in the context of a global crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic but may also help reduce personal and economic costs of mental health impairment beyond this situation or in the context of potential future pandemics.","Marciniak, Marta Anna; Shanahan, Lilly; Rohde, Judith; Schulz, Ava; Wackerhagen, Carolin; Kobylinska, Dorota; Tuescher, Oliver; Binder, Harald; Walter, Henrik; Kalisch, Raffael; Kleim, Birgit",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,571

One population that has been scarcely studied is non-neutropenic patients admitted specifically to medical ICUs. Even less is known about the broader category of medical ICU patients without active oncological disease. This group constitutes a very large share of the patients requiring critical care across the globe, especially in the era of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We analysed medical ICU candidaemia episodes that occurred in non-oncological patients in our tertiary academic centre in the United States from May 2014 to October 2020 to determine the incidence and species distribution of the associated isolates. We then separately considered non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 cases and compared their characteristics. In the non-COVID-19 group, there were 38 cases for an incidence of 1.1% and rate of 11/1000 admissions. In the COVID-19 group, there were 12 cases for an incidence of 5.1% and rate of 51/1000 admissions. In the entire sample, as well as separately in the non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 groups,Candida albicans accounted for a minority of isolates. Compared to non-COVID-19 patients with candidaemia, COVID-19 patients had lower ICU admission SOFA score but longer ICU length of stay and central venous catheter dwell time at candidaemia detection. This study provides valuable insight into the incidence and species distribution of candidaemia cases occurring in non-oncological critically ill patients and identifies informative differences between non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 patients.","Macauley, Precious; Epelbaum, Oleg",Mycoses,,571

388264,Ten considerations for effectively managing the COVID-19 transition,2020,"PURPOSE: After coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the WHO, a response from the Italian Health System to react to an unprecedented condition became necessary and sudden. The COVID-19 pandemic has required oncologists to redefine clinical organization and patient management. The purpose of our study was to document the difficulties emerging during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Italian oncology. METHODS: We broadcasted an electronic survey to oncologic health care professionals. It consisted of 45 questions ranging from individual perception of pandemic management by hospital centers to physicians' and nurses' psychological distress and patient care. RESULTS: A total of 383 oncology health workers participated in the survey. The majority were female (71.8%) and from central Italy (46.2%). Impressively, a total of 357 (93%) participants declared the oncologic department reorganized routine clinical activity, but only 40.5% were adequately trained about the required procedures; 20% of the survey respondents think they have not received adequate and timely protective devices. CONCLUSION: Our survey demonstrated the flexibility of oncologic teams. However, the emergency response quality has been heterogeneous, and several drawbacks have emerged from the first analyses investigating how the world of oncology changes in the COVID-19 pandemic. Information, protection, testing, and training of health care professionals are key words that should be kept in mind to encourage recovery after this tragedy and to be ready to face a similar emergency in the future.","Ballatore, Zelmira; Bastianelli, Lucia; Merloni, Filippo; Ranallo, Nicoletta; Cantini, Luca; Marcantognini, Giulia; Berardi, Rossana",JCO Glob Oncol,,571

Neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and social vulnerability index (SVI) were measured via a census-based scoring system. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations between SES, SVI, race and ethnicity, and MIS-C diagnosis and clinical severity as outcomes. RESULTS: Among 43 patients with MIS-C, 19 (44%) were Hispanic, 11 (26%) were Black, and 12 (28%) were white; 22 (51%) were in the lowest quartile SES, and 23 (53%) were in the highest quartile SVI. SES and SVI were similar between patients with MIS-C and coronavirus disease 2019. In multivariable analysis, lowest SES quartile (odds ratio 2.2 [95% confidence interval 1.1-4.4]), highest SVI quartile (odds ratio 2.8 [95% confidence interval 1.5-5.1]), and racial and/or ethnic minority background were associated with MIS-C diagnosis. Neither SES, SVI, race, nor ethnicity were associated with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Lower SES or higher SVI, Hispanic ethnicity, and Black race independently increased risk for MIS-C. Additional studies are required to target interventions to improve health equity for children.","Javalkar, Karina; Robson, Victoria K; Gaffney, Lukas; Bohling, Amy M; Arya, Puneeta; Servattalab, Sarah; Roberts, Jordan E; Campbell, Jeffrey I; Sekhavat, Sepehr; Newburger, Jane W; de Ferranti, Sarah D; Baker, Annette L; Lee, Pui Y; Day-Lewis, Megan; Bucholz, Emily; Kobayashi, Ryan; Son, Mary Beth; Henderson, Lauren A; Kheir, John N; Friedman, Kevin G; Dionne, Audrey",Pediatrics,,571
388524,Insight into the COVID-19 led slow-down in TB notifications in India,2021,"PURPOSE: We aimed to report the clinical characteristics of 194 cases coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in Huanggang, Hubei and Taian, Shandong. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the clinical, laboratory characteristics and CT imaging of confirmed cases of COVID-19 from January 22 to February 28, 2020 in Huanggang Central Hospital and The Second Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University. Real time PCR was used to detect the new coronavirus in respiratory samples. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the expressions of ACE2 in tissues. RESULTS: Among the 194 patients infected with COVID-19, 108 patients were male, with a median age of 48.3 years. The average preclinical period was 7.44 day. Except for 37 severe or critically ill patients, the rest of the 157 patients exhibited mild or moderate symptoms. 190 (97.94%) patients were confirmed during the three times nucleic acid test. The main clinical symptom of the patients were fever, sore throat and cough, which accounted for 146 cases (75.26%), 98 (50.52%) and 86 cases (44.33%), respectively. 30 patients (15.46%) showed liver dysfunction. Imaging examination showed that 141 patients (72.68%) showed abnormal density shadow, while 53 cases (27.32%) had no obvious abnormality in the parenchyma of both lungs. Up to now, 109 cases have been discharged from the hospital, and 9 patients died. The ACE2 expression levels were up-regulated in patients of severe type and critically ill type. CONCLUSION: Clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and CT imaging should be combined for comprehensive analysis to diagnose COVID-19. ACE2 may be the receptor of COVID-19.","Zhang, Hong; Shang, Wenli; Liu, Qinghua; Zhang, Xuejing; Zheng, Maochuan; Yue, Maokui",Infection,,571

Tendo por base uma análise histórico-institucional do caso brasileiro, busca-se compreender como o modelo federativo construído pelo governo Bolsonaro influenciou as respostas ao combate da pandemia no país, bem como os resultados do confronto de dois modelos federativos nesse processo. De um lado, o ideário e as estruturas institucionais da Constituição de 1988 com características cooperativas e forte coordenação federal. De outro, o federalismo bolsonarista baseia-se numa visão dualista de relações intergovernamentais, com menor participação da União na redução de desigualdades territoriais e no apoio a governos subnacionais, além da postura centralizadora e hierárquica nas questões de impacto nacional. O estudo mostra que o federalismo bolsonarista aumentou o conflito com governos subnacionais e tem descoordenado políticas públicas de enfrentamento à pandemia. Conclui-se que as crises sanitária e federativa caminham juntas e trazem à tona uma questão chave: a importância da coordenação governamental nas políticas públicas de enfrentamento à pandemia.","Abrucio, Fernando Luiz; Grin, Eduardo José; Franzese, Cibele; Segatto, Catarina Ianni; Couto, Claúdio Gonçalves",Rev. adm. pública (Online),,571

A disease-specific telemedicine physical examination to reflect myasthenic weakness does not currently exist. METHODS: This paper outlines step-by-step guidance on the fundamentals of a telemedicine assessment for MG. The Myasthenia Gravis Core Exam (MG-CE) is introduced as a MG-specific, telemedicine, physical examination, which contains eight components (ptosis, diplopia, facial strength, bulbar strength, dysarthria, single breath count, arm strength, and sit to stand) and takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. RESULTS: Pre-visit preparation, remote ascertainment of patient-reported outcome scales and visit documentation are also addressed.

Previously we synthetized a cyclic monomer as well as a parallel and an antiparallel dimer of Cm-p5 with improved antifungal activity. Considering the alarming increase of microbial resistance to conventional antibiotics, here we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of these derivatives against multiresistant and problematic bacteria and against important viral agents. The three peptides showed a moderate activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae&nbsp;Extended Spectrum ß-Lactamase (ESBL), and Streptococcus agalactiae, with MIC values > 100 µg/mL. They exerted a considerable activity with MIC values between 25-50 µg/mL against Acinetobacter baumanii and Enterococcus faecium. In addition, the two dimers showed a moderate activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14. The three Cm-p5 derivatives inhibited a virulent extracellular strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, they inhibited Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2) infection in a concentration-dependent manner, but had no effect on infection by the Zika Virus (ZIKV) or pseudoparticles of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). At concentrations of >100 µg/mL, the three new Cm-p5 derivatives showed toxicity on different eukaryotic cells tested.

389099,"Infection prevention and control in blood purification centers during the COVID-19 epidemic: a single institution experience from Zhejiang, China",2020,"BACKGROUND: Covid-19 has caused many complications for both the infected and those in need of medical care. This may be due to infection-related prognosis worsening or the patients' avoidance of referring to the hospital for fear of contracting the infection. The decline of acute referral to the ER of many significant conditions with severe results on both the well-being and life-expectancy is a serious concern. To address these concerns, we designed this study to evaluate the recent pandemic's impact on ""in-hospital mortality"" caused by neurological disorders pre and postpandemic. METHODS AND MATERIAL: The inclusion criteria were any acute neurological condition and the consent of the patients eligible for our study. The definitions of all assessed conditions and the comorbidities are ICD-10 based. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus, due to their high prevalence, were evaluated separately from other internal comorbidities. The total number of the enrolled patients was 1742, 671 of whom had been during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 1071 had attended the ER during the prepandemic era. RESULTS: The overall mortality was significantly higher during the pandemic, and the covid infected had suffered higher mortality rates. (p-value < 0.05) CONCLUSION: During the pandemic, those with minor strokes and other nonlife-threatening ailments had avoided hospital care leading to a significantly higher rate of critical conditions. Increased incidence of strokes and ICHs during the pandemic, too, caused significant increased in-hospital mortality.","Khoshsirat, Nahid Abbasi; Qorbani, Mostafa; Farivar, Ali Mokhtari; Mohammadpoor Nami, Sahar; Mohammadian Khonsari, Nami",Brain Behav,,571

389356,Improving Healthcare Access in the States After COVID-19,2020,"Migraine is a complex disabling condition which is associated with dysregulation of several pathways particularly those being associated with immune responses. In order to assess contribution of protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) in the pathogenesis of migraine, we quantified expression levels of PIAS1-PIAS4 genes in the circulation of patients with migraine compared with controls. Expression of PIAS1 was substantially lower in total migraineurs compared with controls (ratio of mean expressions (RME) = 0.18, SE = 0.29, P value < 0.001) and in both male and female migraineurs compared with sex-matched controls. Expression of PIAS2 was lower in migraineurs without aura compared with controls (RME = 0.64, SE = 0.31, P value = 0.04) and in male subgroup of these patients compared with male controls (RME = 0.60, SE = 0.22, P value < 0.001). In migraineurs with aura, downregulation of PIAS2 was only observed among male subgroups (RME = 0.37, SE = 0.49, P value = 0.01). PIAS3 was downregulated in total male migraineurs (RME = 0.52, SE = 0.43, P value = 0.04) and in male migraineurs with aura (RME = 0.49, SE = 0.45, P value = 0.03) compared with male controls. Finally, PIAS4 was upregulated in total migraineurs (RME = 3.78, SE = 0. 34, P value < 0.001), female migraineurs (RME = 5.26, SE = 0.36, P value < 0.001), migraineurs with aura (RME = 4.24, SE = 0.42, P value < 0.001), female migraineurs with aura (RME = 6.13, SE = 0.47, P value < 0.001), migraineurs without aura (RME = 3.33, SE = 0.38, P value < 0.001), and female migraineurs without aura (RME = 4.47, SE = 0.41, P value < 0.001) compared with the corresponding controls. The present study suggests contribution of PIAS genes in the pathogenesis of migraine and warrants future studies to clarify the functional routes of their contribution.","Ghafouri-Fard, Soudeh; Hesami, Omid; Nazer, Naghme; Sayad, Arezou; Taheri, Mohammad",J. mol. neurosci,,571

It was found that the B.1.1.7 (also 501Y.V1) variant, first detected in the United Kingdom, could be serendipitously detected by the Thermo Fisher TaqPath COVID-19 PCR assay because a key deletion in these viruses, spike &#916;69-70, would cause a ""spike gene target failure"" (SGTF) result. However, a SGTF result is not definitive for B.1.1.7, and this assay cannot detect other variants of concern (VOC) that lack spike &#916;69-70, such as B.1.351 (also 501Y.V2), detected in South Africa, and P.1 (also 501Y.V3), recently detected in Brazil. We identified a deletion in the ORF1a gene (ORF1a &#916;3675-3677) in all 3 variants, which has not yet been widely detected in other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Using ORF1a &#916;3675-3677 as the primary target and spike &#916;69-70 to differentiate, we designed and validated an open-source PCR assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 VOC.

389684,Monday effect on confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Japan,2021,"BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a complex lung disease, characterized by progressive lung scarring. Severe COVID-19 is associated with substantial pneumonitis and has a number of shared major risk factors with IPF. This study aimed to determine the genetic correlation between IPF and severe COVID-19 and assess a potential causal role of genetically increased risk of IPF on COVID-19 severity. METHODS: The genetic correlation between IPF and COVID-19 severity was estimated with linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression. We performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) study for IPF causality in COVID-19. Genetic variants associated with IPF susceptibility (P<5 × 10-8) in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were used as instrumental variables (IVs). Effect estimates of those IVs on COVID-19 severity were gathered from the GWAS meta-analysis by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (4,336 cases & 623,902 controls). FINDINGS: We detected a positive genetic correlation of IPF with COVID-19 severity (rg=0·31 [95% CI 0·04-0·57], P = 0·023). The MR estimates for severe COVID-19 did not reveal any genetic association (OR 1·05, [95% CI 0·92-1·20], P = 0·43). However, outlier analysis revealed that the IPF risk allele rs35705950 at MUC5B had a different effect compared with the other variants. When rs35705950 was excluded, MR results provided evidence that genetically increased risk of IPF has a causal effect on COVID-19 severity (OR 1·21, [95% CI 1·06-1·38], P = 4·24 × 10-3). Furthermore, the IPF risk-allele at MUC5B showed an apparent protective effect against COVID-19 hospitalization only in older adults (OR 0·86, [95% CI 0·73-1·00], P = 2·99 × 10-2) . INTERPRETATION: The strongest genetic determinant of IPF, rs35705950 at MUC5B, seems to confer protection against COVID-19, whereas the combined effect of all other IPF risk loci seem to confer risk of COVID-19 severity. The observed effect of rs35705950 could either be due to protective effects of mucin over-production on the airways or a consequence of selection bias due to (1) a patient group that is heavily enriched for the rs35705950 T undertaking strict self-isolation and/or (2) due to survival bias of the rs35705950 non-IPF risk allele carriers. Due to the diverse impact of IPF causal variants on SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a possible selection bias as an explanation, further investigation is needed to address this apparent paradox between variance at MUC5B and other IPF genetic risk factors.

The main aim of this study is to examine the level of psychological distress during COVID-19 in Bangladesh and explore factors associated with higher psychological distress. Methods: An internet-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted from March to April 2020 in Bangladesh among adults 18 years old and above using structured online questionnaires distributed through emails and other social media throughout Bangladesh with an overall response rate of 34%. Modified version of the Covid19 peritraumatic distress index (CPDI) was used to measure distress. Univariate and Bivariate analysis was used to estimate prevalence of CPDI symptoms and test for the associations between CPDI and the exposure variables. Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the odds ratios of our outcome variable by exposure variables. Results: Overall, 44.3% of respondents were suffering from mild to moderate distress and 9.5% were suffering from severe distress. Female respondents were 2.435 times more likely to suffer from CPDI mild to severe distress than males. As compared to Dhaka and Mymensing region of Bangladesh, odds of distress was 1.945 times more in Chittagong/Sylhet region (p-valueâ¯=â¯0.035). Conclusion: Large proportion of adult population in Bangladesh are experiencing psychological distress, with level of distress varies by different symptoms and predictors. This study suggest the need to develop comprehensive crisis prevention system including epidemiological monitoring, screening, and referral with targeted intervention to reduce psychological distress.","Marzo, Roy Rillera; Singh, Akansha; Mukti, Roushney Fatima",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,,571

390834,Update: COVID-19 Upends Progress on Opioid Crisis,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 infects cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a ubiquitous receptor that interacts with the virus' surface S glycoprotein. Recent reports show that the virus affects the central nervous system (CNS) with symptoms and complications that include dizziness, altered consciousness, encephalitis, and even stroke. These can immerge as indirect immune effects due to increased cytokine production or via direct viral entry into brain tissue. The latter is possible through neuronal access via the olfactory bulb, hematogenous access through immune cells or directly across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and through the brain's circumventricular organs characterized by their extensive and highly permeable capillaries. Last, the COVID-19 pandemic increases stress, depression, and anxiety within infected individuals, those in isolation, and high-risk populations like children, the elderly, and health workers.

We aimed to summarize and critically appraise systematic reviews of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in humans that were available at the beginning of the pandemic. METHODS: Nine databases (Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Sciences, PDQ-Evidence, WHO's Global Research, LILACS, and Epistemonikos) were searched from December 1, 2019, to March 24, 2020. Systematic reviews analyzing primary studies of COVID-19 were included. Two authors independently undertook screening, selection, extraction (data on clinical symptoms, prevalence, pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, diagnostic test assessment, laboratory, and radiological findings), and quality assessment (AMSTAR 2). A meta-analysis was performed of the prevalence of clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Eighteen systematic reviews were included; one was empty (did not identify any relevant study). Using AMSTAR 2, confidence in the results of all 18 reviews was rated as ""critically low"". Identified symptoms of COVID-19 were (range values of point estimates): fever (82-95%), cough with or without sputum (58-72%), dyspnea (26-59%), myalgia or muscle fatigue (29-51%), sore throat (10-13%), headache (8-12%) and gastrointestinal complaints (5-9%). Severe symptoms were more common in men. Elevated C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase, and slightly elevated aspartate and alanine aminotransferase, were commonly described. Thrombocytopenia and elevated levels of procalcitonin and cardiac troponin I were associated with severe disease. A frequent finding on chest imaging was uni- or bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity. A single review investigated the impact of medication (chloroquine) but found no verifiable clinical data. All-cause mortality ranged from 0.3 to 13.9%. CONCLUSIONS: In this overview of systematic reviews, we analyzed evidence from the first 18 systematic reviews that were published after the emergence of COVID-19. However, confidence in the results of all reviews was ""critically low"". Thus, systematic reviews that were published early on in the pandemic were of questionable usefulness. Even during public health emergencies, studies and systematic reviews should adhere to established methodological standards.","Borges do Nascimento, Israel Júnior; O039,; Mathúna, Dónal P; von Groote, Thilo Caspar; Abdulazeem, Hebatullah Mohamed; Weerasekara, Ishanka; Marusic, Ana; Puljak, Livia; Civile, Vinicius Tassoni; Zakarija-Grkovic, Irena; Pericic, Tina Poklepovic; Atallah, Alvaro Nagib; Filoso, Santino; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Marcolino, Milena Soriano",BMC Infect Dis,,571

391356,The COVID-19 Lockdown Effect on the Intention to Purchase Sustainable Brands,2021,"PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been spreading rapidly worldwide since late January 2020. The strict lockdown strategy prompted by the Italian government, to hamper severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) spreading, has reduced the possibility of performing either outdoor or gym physical activity (PA). This study investigated and quantified the reduction of PA in patients with automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) for primary prevention of sudden death. METHODS: Daily PA of 24 patients was estimated by processing recorded data from ICD-embedded accelerometric sensors used by the rate-responsive pacing systems. RESULTS: During the forced 40-d in-home confinement, a mean 25% reduction of PA was observed as compared with the 40-d confinement-free period (1.2 ± 0.3 vs 1.6 ± 0.5 hr/d, respectively, P = .0001). CONCLUSIONS: This objective quantification of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on PA determined by an ICD device showed an abrupt and statistically significant reduction of PA in primary prevention ICD patients, during the in-home confinement quarantine. To counteract the deleterious effects of physical inactivity during the COVID-19 outbreak, patients should be encouraged to perform indoor exercise-based personalized rehabilitative programs.","Sassone, Biagio; Mandini, Simona; Grazzi, Giovanni; Mazzoni, Gianni; Myers, Jonathan; Pasanisi, Giovanni",J Cardiopulm Rehabil Prev,,571

391781,Addressing the ACGME Mandate for Healthcare Disparities Education in Residency Programs: A Needs Assessment,2021,"BACKGROUND: Adverse mental health consequences of COVID-19, including anxiety and depression, have been widely predicted but not yet accurately measured. There are a range of physical health risk factors for COVID-19, but it is not known if there are also psychiatric risk factors. In this electronic health record network cohort study using data from 69 million individuals, 62â354 of whom had a diagnosis of COVID-19, we assessed whether a diagnosis of COVID-19 (compared with other health events) was associated with increased rates of subsequent psychiatric diagnoses, and whether patients with a history of psychiatric illness are at a higher risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: We used the TriNetX Analytics Network, a global federated network that captures anonymised data from electronic health records in 54 health-care organisations in the USA, totalling 69·8 million patients. TriNetX included 62â354 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between Jan 20, and Aug 1, 2020. We created cohorts of patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 or a range of other health events. We used propensity score matching to control for confounding by risk factors for COVID-19 and for severity of illness. We measured the incidence of and hazard ratios (HRs) for psychiatric disorders, dementia, and insomnia, during the first 14 to 90 days after a diagnosis of COVID-19. FINDINGS: In patients with no previous psychiatric history, a diagnosis of COVID-19 was associated with increased incidence of a first psychiatric diagnosis in the following 14 to 90 days compared with six other health events (HR 2·1, 95% CI 1·8-2·5 vs influenza; 1·7, 1·5-1·9 vs other respiratory tract infections; 1·6, 1·4-1·9 vs skin infection; 1·6, 1·3-1·9 vs cholelithiasis; 2·2, 1·9-2·6 vs urolithiasis, and 2·1, 1·9-2·5 vs fracture of a large bone; all p<0·0001). The HR was greatest for anxiety disorders, insomnia, and dementia. We observed similar findings, although with smaller HRs, when relapses and new diagnoses were measured. The incidence of any psychiatric diagnosis in the 14 to 90 days after COVID-19 diagnosis was 18·1% (95% CI 17·6-18·6), including 5·8% (5·2-6·4) that were a first diagnosis. The incidence of a first diagnosis of dementia in the 14 to 90 days after COVID-19 diagnosis was 1·6% (95% CI 1·2-2·1) in people older than 65 years. A psychiatric diagnosis in the previous year was associated with a higher incidence of COVID-19 diagnosis (relative risk 1·65, 95% CI 1·59-1·71; p<0·0001). This risk was independent of known physical health risk factors for COVID-19, but we cannot exclude possible residual confounding by socioeconomic factors. INTERPRETATION: Survivors of COVID-19 appear to be at increased risk of psychiatric sequelae, and a psychiatric diagnosis might be an independent risk factor for COVID-19. Although preliminary, our findings have implications for clinical services, and prospective cohort studies are warranted.

392322,The need for a federal Basic Income feature within any coherent post-COVID-19 economic recovery plan,2021,"Purpose: Severe acute kidney injury (AKI) is a potential complication of COVID-19-associated critical illness. This has implications for the management of COVID-19-associated AKI and the resulting increased need for kidney replacement therapy (KRT) in the intensive care unit (ICU) and elsewhere in the hospital. The Canadian Society of Nephrology COVID-19 Rapid Review Team has sought to collate and synthesize currently available resources to inform ethically justifiable decisions. The goal is the provision of the best possible care for the largest number of patients with kidney disease while considering how best to ensure the safety of the health care team. Information sources: Local, provincial, national, and international guidance and planning documents related to the COVID-19 pandemic; guidance documents available from nephrology and critical care-related professional organizations; recent journal articles and preprints related to the COVID-19 pandemic; expert opinion from nephrologists from across Canada. Methods: A working group of kidney specialist physicians was established with representation from across Canada. Kidney physician specialists met via teleconference and exchanged e-mails to refine and agree on the proposed suggestions in this document. Key findings: (1) Nephrology programs should work with ICU programs to plan for the possibility that up to 30% or more of critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICU will require kidney replacement therapy (KRT). (2) Specific suggestions pertinent to the optimal management of AKI and KRT in patients with COVID-19. These suggestions include, but are not limited to, aspects of fluid management, KRT vascular access, and KRT modality choice. (3) We describe considerations related to ensuring adequate provision of KRT, should resources become scarce during the COVID-19 pandemic. Limitations: A systematic review or meta-analysis was not conducted. Our suggestions have not been specifically evaluated in the clinical environment. The local context, including how the provision of acute KRT is organized, may impede the implementation of many suggestions. Knowledge is advancing rapidly in the area of COVID-19 and suggestions may become outdated quickly. Implications: Given that most acute KRT related to COVID-19 is likely to be required initially in the ICU setting, close collaboration and planning between critical care and nephrology programs is required. Suggestions may be updated as newer evidence becomes available.","Clark, Edward G.; Hiremath, Swapnil; Soroka, Steven D.; Wald, Ron; Weir, Matthew A.; Antonsen, John; Banks, Cheryl; Clark, David; Copland, Michael; Davison, Sara N.; Goldberg, Aviva; Hemmett, Juliya; Kappel, Joanne; MacRae, Jennifer M.; Mac-Way, Fabrice; Mathew, Anna; McCormick, Brendan; Moist, Louise; Moran, Sarah; Pandeya, Sanjay; Qirjazi, Elena; Ryz, Krista; Singh, Suneet; Suri, Rita; Tennankore, Karthik; Thanabalasingam, Susan; White, Christine; Zimmerman, Deborah; Levin, Adeera; Mustafa, Reem A.; Nesrallah, Gihad",Can.

Here, based on bioinformatic analysis, I provide evidence that some members of the upper respiratory tract (URT) commensal bacteria express viral S-protein -binding proteins. Based on this analysis and available data showing a decline in the population of these bacteria in the elderly, I propose that some URT commensal bacteria hamper SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and that a decline in the population of these bacteria contributes to the severity of infection. Further studies should provide a better understanding of the interaction of URT bacteria and SARS-CoV-2, which may lead to new therapeutic approaches.","Honarmand Ebrahimi, Kourosh",FEBS Lett,,571

The Marseille-4 variant caused an epidemic that started in August and is still ongoing. METHODS: The 1038 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences obtained in our laboratory by next-generation sequencing with Illumina technology were analysed using Nextclade and nextstrain/ncov pipelines and IQ-TREE. A Marseille-4-specific qPCR assay was implemented. Demographic and clinical features were compared between patients with the Marseille-4 variant and those with earlier strains. RESULTS: Marseille-4 harbours 13 hallmark mutations. One leads to an S477N substitution in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein targeted by current vaccines. Using a specific qPCR, it was observed that Marseille-4 caused 12-100% of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Marseille from September 2020, being involved in 2106 diagnoses. This variant was more frequently associated with hypoxemia than were clade 20A strains before May 2020. It caused a re-infection in 11 patients diagnosed with different SARS-CoV-2 strains before June 2020, suggesting either short-term protective immunity or a lack of cross-immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Marseille-4 should be considered as a major SARS-CoV-2 variant. Its sudden appearance points towards an animal reservoir, possibly mink. The protective role of past exposure and current vaccines against this variant should be evaluated.","Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Colson, Philippe; Levasseur, Anthony; Devaux, Christian A; Gautret, Philippe; Bedotto, Marielle; Delerce, Jeremy; Brechard, Ludivine; Pinault, Lucile; Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Fenollar, Florence; Raoult, Didier",Int J Infect Dis,,571
393999,From Brexit to COVID-19,2020,"Since the pandemic outbreak of Covid-19 in December 2019, several lateral flow assay (LFA) devices were developed to enable the constant monitoring of regional and global infection processes. Additionally, innumerable lateral flow test devices are frequently used for determination of different clinical parameters, food safety, and environmental factors. Since common LFAs rely on non-biodegradable nitrocellulose membranes, we focused on their replacement by cellulose-composed, biodegradable papers. We report the development of cellulose paper-based lateral flow immunoassays using a carbohydrate-binding module-fused to detection antibodies. Studies regarding the protein binding capacity and potential protein wash-off effects on cellulose paper demonstrated a 2.7-fold protein binding capacity of CBM-fused antibody fragments compared to the sole antibody fragment. Furthermore, this strategy improved the spatial retention of CBM-fused detection antibodies to the test area, which resulted in an enhanced sensitivity and improved overall LFA-performance compared to the naked detection antibody. CBM-assisted antibodies were validated by implementation into two model lateral flow test devices (pregnancy detection and the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies). The CBM-assisted pregnancy LFA demonstrated sensitive detection of human gonadotropin (hCG) in synthetic urine and the CBM-assisted Covid-19 antibody LFA was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies present in serum. Our findings pave the way to the more frequent use of cellulose-based papers instead of nitrocellulose in LFA devices and thus potentially improve the sustainability in the field of POC diagnostics.","Elter, Adrian; Bock, Tina; Spiehl, Dieter; Russo, Giulio; Hinz, Steffen C; Bitsch, Sebastian; Baum, Eva; Langhans, Markus; Meckel, Tobias; Dörsam, Edgar; Kolmar, Harald; Schwall, Gerhard",Sci Rep,,571

Combining conserved antigens inducing cross-protective antibody response with epitopes activating cross-protective cytotoxic T-cells would offer an attractive strategy for developing universal vaccine. In this study, we constructed a recombinant protein NMHC consisting of influenza viral conserved epitopes and superantigen fragment. NMHC promoted the mature of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and induced CD4+ T cells to differentiate into Th1, Th2 and Th17 subtypes. Mice vaccinated with NMHC produced high level of immunoglobulins which cross-bound to HA fragments from six influenza virus subtypes with high antibody titers. Anti-NMHC serum showed potent hemagglutinin inhibition effects to highly divergent group 1 (H1 subtypes) and group 2 (H3 subtype) influenza virus strains. And purified anti-NMHC antibodies could bind to multiple HAs with high affinities. NMHC vaccination effectively protected the mice from infection and lung damage challenged by two subtypes of H1N1 influenza virus. Moreover, NMHC vaccination elicited CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to clear the virus from infected tissue and prevent virus spreading. In conclusion, this study provided proof of concept for triggering both B cells and T cells immune responses against multiple influenza virus infection, and NMHC may be a potential candidate of universal broad-spectrum vaccine for various influenza virus prevention and therapy.","Li, Yansheng; Xu, Mingkai; Li, Yongqiang; Gu, Wu; Halimu, Gulinare; Li, Yuqi; Zhang, Zhichun; Zhou, Libao; Liao, Hui; Yao, Songyuan; Zhang, Huiwen; Zhang, Chenggang",,,571

METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study of all pregnant patients with a singleton gestation and a positive test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who delivered at 1 of 33 U.S. hospitals in 14 states from March 1 to July 31, 2020. Disease severity was classified by National Institutes of Health criteria. Maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes were abstracted by centrally trained and certified perinatal research staff. We evaluated trends in maternal characteristics and outcomes across COVID-19 severity classes and associations between severity and outcomes by multivariable modeling. RESULTS: A total of 1,219 patients were included: 47% asymptomatic, 27% mild, 14% moderate, 8% severe, 4% critical. Overall, 53% were Hispanic; there was no trend in race-ethnicity distribution by disease severity. Those with more severe illness had older mean age, higher median body mass index, and pre-existing medical comorbidities. Four maternal deaths (0.3%) were attributed to COVID-19. Frequency of perinatal death or a positive neonatal SARS-CoV-2 test result did not differ by severity. Adverse perinatal outcomes were more frequent among patients with more severe illness, including 6% (95% CI 2-11%) incidence of venous thromboembolism among those with severe-critical illness compared with 0.2% in mild-moderate and 0% in asymptomatic (P<.001 for trend across severity). In adjusted analyses, severe-critical COVID-19 was associated with increased risk of cesarean birth (59.6% vs 34.0%, adjusted relative risk [aRR] 1.57, 95% CI 1.30-1.90), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (40.4% vs 18.8%, aRR 1.61, 95% CI 1.18-2.20), and preterm birth (41.8% vs 11.9%, aRR 3.53, 95% CI 2.42-5.14) compared with asymptomatic patients. Mild-moderate COVID-19 was not associated with adverse perinatal outcomes compared with asymptomatic patients.

With the development of modern technologies, new diagnostic strategies, including multiplex nucleic acid amplification and microarray-based assays, are emerging. This review summarizes currently available and novel emerging diagnostic methods for the detection of common respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, human adenovirus, and human rhinovirus. Multiplex assays for simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses are also described. It is anticipated that such data will assist researchers and clinicians to develop appropriate diagnostic strategies for timely and effective detection of respiratory virus infections.","Zhang, Naru; Wang, Lili; Deng, Xiaoqian; Liang, Ruiying; Su, Meng; He, Chen; Hu, Lanfang; Su, Yudan; Ren, Jing; Yu, Fei; Du, Lanying; Jiang, Shibo",J Med Virol,,571
396633,GI fellowship in the time of COVID-19: Moving forward,2020,"SARS CoV-2 infection and transmission are problematic in developing countries such as Indonesia. Due to the lack of an information system, Provinces must be able to innovate in developing information systems related to surveillance of SARS CoV-2 infection. Jakarta Department of Health built a data management system called Executive Information System (EIS) of COVID-19 Reporting. EIS aimed to provide actual data so that current epidemiological analysis is accurate. The main idea of EIS is to provide valid and actual information to stakeholders, which can then be presented in the form of a dashboard. EIS is utilized to push data flow and management for rapid surveillance purposes. This could be the first time in Indonesia that a system reports near-actual data of nearly half a million people daily using an integrated system through a transparent system. The main data presented is important to monitor and evaluate COVID-19 transmission is the cumulative case dan daily case number. Data in EIS also can offer data geographically so that a more detailed analysis could be done. EIS's data and the dashboard help the government in pandemic control by presenting actual data on bed occupancy and availability across hospitals, especially isolation wards. Stakeholders, academic institutions should utilize EIS data and other elements to help Indonesia fight COVID-19.","Adrian, Verry; Sari, Intan Rachmita; Hikmahrachim, Hardya Gustada",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09738v1.pdf,571

METHODS: From Danish biobanks, we obtained plasma samples from 323 subjects aged 30-70 years with known SARS-CoV-2 infection. The PFAS concentrations measured at the background exposures included five PFASs known to be immunotoxic. Register data was obtained to classify disease status, other health information, and demographic variables. We used ordered logistic regression analyses to determine associations between PFAS concentrations and disease outcome. RESULTS: Plasma-PFAS concentrations were higher in males, in subjects with Western European background, and tended to increase with age, but were not associated with the presence of chronic disease. Of the study population, 108 (33%) had not been hospitalized, and of those hospitalized, 53 (16%) had been in intensive care or were deceased. Among the five PFASs considered, perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) showed an unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of 2.19 (95% confidence interval, CI, 1.39-3.46) for increasing severities of the disease. Among those hospitalized, the fully adjusted OR for getting into intensive care or expiring was 5.18 (1.29, 20.72) when based on plasma samples obtained at the time of diagnosis or up to one week before. CONCLUSIONS: Measures of individual exposures to immunotoxic PFASs included short-chain PFBA known to accumulate in the lungs. Elevated plasma-PFBA concentrations were associated with an increased risk of a more severe course of COVID-19. Given the low background exposure levels in this study, the role of exposure to PFASs in COVID-19 needs to be ascertained in populations with elevated exposures.","Grandjean, Philippe; Timmermann, Clara Amalie Gade; Kruse, Marie; Nielsen, Flemming; Vinholt, Pernille Just; Boding, Lasse; Heilmann, Carsten; Mølbak, Kåre",PLoS One,,571

The current study examined patient-reported experiences in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment during the early stages of the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: Participants in SUD treatment were recruited via online crowdsourcing from April 14, 2020 to May 26, 2020, during the early stages of the COVID-19 crisis. Participants reported disruptions in SUD treatment, stress and anxiety caused by these disruptions on a 0-100 point visual analogue scale (VAS), stress associated with childcare responsibilities on a 0-100 VAS, current stress on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), anxiety symptoms on the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), sleep disturbances on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and whether they used drugs or alcohol during the COVID-19 crisis. RESULTS: Participants (Nâ=â240) endorsed that at least 1 SUD treatment was switched to telemedicine (63.7%), had some appointments cancelled (37.5%), or was discontinued due to COVID-19 (29.6%). Participants who did versus did not endorse drug/alcohol use reported difficulty obtaining medications to treat their SUD (ORâ=â2.47, 95% CI, 1.17-5.22, &#967;2â=â5.98, Pâ=â.016), greater scores on VAS treatment-related stress (F1,197â=â5.70, Pâ=â.018) and anxiety (F1,197â=â4.07, Pâ=â.045), greater VAS stress related to childcare (F1,107â=â10.24, Pâ=â.002), and greater scores on the PSS (F1,235â=â19.27, Pâ<â.001), BAI (F1,235â=â28.59, Pâ<â.001), and ISI (F1,235â=â14.41, Pâ<â.001).

398289,The Moral Obligation of Nurse Leaders: COVID-19,2020,"Speciated hourly measurements of fine aerosols were made for more than two years at an urban, an industrial and a port site in Busan, Korea. A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was designed to deconvolve factors contributing to the pollutant concentrations at multiple scales. The model yields estimates of source contributions to pollution by separately identifying the signals in the time series due to meteorology, vertical mixing, horizontal wind transport and temporal variations such as diurnal, weekly, seasonal and annual trends. The GAM model was expanded to include FLEXPART back trajectory clusters generated using fuzzy c-means clustering. This made it possible to quantify the impact of long-range transport using the Trajectory Cluster Contribution Function (TCCF). TCCF provides a development of methods such as Concentration Field Analysis and Potential Source Contribution Function by providing numerical estimates of concentration changes associated with different air mass transport patterns while accounting for possible confounding factors from meteorology. The GAM simulations identified the importance of local transport for primary pollutants and long-range transport from China for secondary pollutants. Local factors accounted for up to 72% of the variance in concentrations of NO2 and elemental carbon whereas large-scale/seasonal factors accounted for up to 56% of PM2.5 and 80% of inorganic species. The algorithm further identified the importance of the weekend effect and the holiday effect at the different sites in Busan. The residual from the analysis was used to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The signature of the pandemic was different between the pollutants as well as from site to site. The model was able to distinguish small impacts from local pollutants at the residential site; short-lived acute impacts from industrial changes; and longer-term changes due to the early pandemic response in China.","de Foy, Benjamin; Heo, Jongbae; Kang, Ji-Yoon; Kim, Hwajin; Schauer, James J",Sci Total Environ,,571
398596,Stock Market Analysis of 10 Different Countries in the Period of Disease COVID-19 (preprint),2020,"BACKGROUND: Perceptual congruence has been defined as the level of agreement between partners on various aspects of their shared lives, including perceived engagement in individual and jointly performed activities. While the level of adjustment made by partners to such activities is thought to contribute to a couple's sense of mutuality, perceptions of time use concerning activity engagement has yet to be considered. As such, this study will determine the level of perceptual congruence between partners with respect to perceived time use in their respective and shared activities. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the IP-COUPLES study is to determine the similarities and differences between partners in terms of their perceptual congruence with respect to independent and jointly performed activities. This study will also examine the association between independent and joint activities in terms of perceptual congruence of time use and the strength of this association. METHODS: This descriptive observational study includes 100 couples from Western Switzerland who are recruited using snowball sampling methods. The Life Balance Inventory (LBI), a self-report questionnaire that captures activity configuration congruence, will measure independent and joint perceptions of both time use allocated to daily activities and corresponding satisfaction. Due to COVID-19, the protocol can be administered virtually by the primary investigator. The mean scores of perceptual congruence variables will be used for analysis, namely perceived congruence of time use in terms of independent and jointly performed activities. For the first objective, an independent t test will be used for each variable to compare the mean score between activities on the LBI. For the second objective, the correlations between the mean scores for these activities will be calculated for each variable using the Pearson correlation. RESULTS: The IP-COUPLES study protocol was developed in 2019 and 2020. Enrollment began in June 2020. Data collection will continue until October 2021 to account for time needed for recruitment due to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Analysis and presentation of results are expected in 2022. CONCLUSIONS: This study is exploratory, as it is the first to our knowledge to investigate how perceived time-use patterns with respect to independent or jointly performed activities are similar or different among romantic couples. By investigating the interpersonal perception of time-use patterns among couples, the IP-COUPLES study is an important first step to understanding how romantic partners' daily activities are contributing to the level of satisfaction as a partner and as a couple and to the sense of mutuality between partners in a romantic relationship.

Motivated by the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic, the article provides an overview of scientific evidence regarding adverse impact of diverse human disasters on mental health in afflicted groups and societies. Following this broader context, psychosocial impact of COVID-19 as a specific global human disaster is presented, with an emphasis on disturbing mental health aspects of the ongoing pandemic. Limited resources of mental health services in a number of countries around the world are illustrated, which will be further stretched by the forthcoming increase in demand for mental health services due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health challenges are particularly important for the Republic of Croatia in the current situation, due to disturbing stress of the 2020 Zagreb earthquake and the high pre-pandemic prevalence of chronic Homeland-War-related posttraumatic stress disorders. Comprehensive approach based on digital psychiatry is proposed to address the lack of access to psychiatric services, which includes artificial intelligence, telepsychiatry and an array of new technologies, like internet-based computer-aided mental health tools and services. These tools and means should be utilized as an important part of the whole package of measures to mitigate negative mental health effects of the global coronavirus pandemic. Our scientific and engineering experiences in the design and development of digital tools and means in mitigation of stress-related disorders and assessment of stress resilience are presented. Croatian initiative on enhancement of interdisciplinary research of psychiatrists, psychologists and computer scientists on the national and EU level is important in addressing pressing mental health concerns related to the ongoing pandemic and similar human disasters.","Cosic, Kresimir; Popovic, Sinisa; Sarlija, Marko; Kesedzic, Ivan",Psychiatr Danub,,571

METHODS: The data were collected from October 1, 2012, to September 30, 2013, for infant deliveries with nonsyndromic CL±P in all hospitals of 4 provinces in the region. Workshops were conducted to establish diagnostic criteria, treatment guidelines, referral systems, data collection, and data reporting. All patients included in this study, including a case (the child born with cleft lip and palate [CLP]) and 2 control cases (2 following children born without CLP in the same hospital), completed a questionnaire regarding demographics, cleft characteristics, and factors of interest such as alcohol intake, smoking, vitamin use, and medication. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio were presented for the magnitude of associations between proposed risk factors and CL±P along with 95% CIs. RESULTS: The overall birth prevalence of CL±P was 1.93 per 1000 live births. There was a significant difference in percentages of infants with low birth weights (P = .03), family history of CL±P (P = .01) in cases than controls. Mothers who took self-medication or a menstrual regulation supplement were more likely to have the child with CL±P (P = .01 adjusted). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CL±P in the NE Thailand was high. Low infant birth weight, family history of CL±P, and the use of self-medication or menstrual regulation herbal supplement was significant factors.","Chowchuen, Bowornsilp; Surakunprapha, Palakorn; Winaikosol, Kengkart; Punyavong, Pattama; Kiatchoosakun, Pakaphan; Pradubwong, Suteera",Cleft Palate Craniofac J,,571

However, the association between such changes and maternal mental health has not been examined, and comparable pre-COVID-19 baseline data were lacking. Thus, we aimed to examine the relationships between changes due to COVID-19 pandemic and the development of depressive and anxiety symptoms among mothers of infants and/or preschoolers in Japan. DESIGN: Prospective follow-up study. The baseline survey was conducted in February 2020, and the follow-up survey was conducted in June 2020. SETTING: All 47 prefectures in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: At the baseline, 4700 mothers of infants and/or preschoolers (0-6 years) participated in the online survey (100 respondents per prefecture); 2489 of them also participated in the follow-up survey. After excluding 203 participants with a higher risk of severe mental illness at the baseline, 2286 were included in the analysis. OUTCOME MEASURES: The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale was used to measure depressive and anxiety symptoms, with a cut-off point of 13 or more. We estimated the adjusted OR (AOR) using multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 151 (6.6%) of respondents newly developed depressive and anxiety symptoms. Participants who experienced a shortage of relaxation time (AOR 1.61, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.47), increased difficulty in child rearing (AOR 1.89, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.70), increased partner aggression (AOR 2.93, 95% CI 1.42 to 6.05) and an increased sense of unfairness (AOR 1.74, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.73) were more likely to develop these symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in circumstances and perceptions during COVID-19 outbreak were significantly related to the development of depressive and anxiety symptoms among mothers of young children.

With delays in the 2021 Electronic Residency Applications Service (ERAS) timeline, students and programs have had more time to interact prior to the formal application process. This communication will report recent trends in social media presence by OHNS residency programs, and discuss mechanisms to compensate for decreased applicant-program interactions using social media ahead of the 2021 Match. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of the accredited otolaryngology residency programs in the United States, the number of social media profiles on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook from 2009 to 2019 were recorded and compared. RESULTS: Most programs (61%) have at least 1 social media profile. Over the past 10 years, the number of programs on social media has increased. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Twitter and Instagram showed higher rates of growth compared to Facebook. With the reduction of in-person opportunities for interactions, both applicants and programs are utilizing social media to showcase their values and their research. Twitter, in particular, also serves as a platform for professional networking. CONCLUSION: Both Twitter and Instagram are growing in popularity among programs and applicants to enhance networking. Social media is a powerful tool for networking and may help compensate for limitations imposed on the residency match process by the COVID-19 pandemic while maintaining professionalism considerations. The impact of social media on the 2021 otolaryngology residency match is an evolving phenomenon.","Ahmadmehrabi, Shadi; Xie, Deborah X; Ward, Bryan K; Bryson, Paul C; Byrne, Patrick",Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,,571

This study compared knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of COVID-19 among healthcare workers (HCWs) and non-healthcare workers (non-HCWs) and examined common associated factors. A web-based cross-sectional study of 1,871 respondents (430 HCWs and 1,441 non-HCWs) was conducted while lockdown measures were in place in 4 regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Data were obtained using a validated self-administered questionnaire via an online survey platform. Mean scores were calculated and summarized using a t test for both groups. Multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted to assess the unadjusted (B) and adjusted coefficients (ß) with a confidence interval (CI) of 95%. The mean scores were slightly higher among HCWs than non-HCWs, but not statistically significant. Being worried about contracting COVID-19 was the only common factor associated with knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions between the 2 groups. Knowledge of COVID-19 was associated with attitudes and perceptions between the 2 groups. Other significant associated factors were: the sub-Saharan Africa region, ages 29 to 38 years (ß = .32; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.60 for knowledge among non-HCWs), education (ß = -.43; 95% CI, -0.81 to -0.04; and ß = -.95; 95% CI, -1.69 to -0.22, for knowledge among non-HCWs and HCWs, respectively), practice of self-isolation (ß = .71; 95% CI, 0.41 to 1.02 for attitude among non-HCWs and HCWs (ß = .97; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.49), and home quarantine due to COVID-19, in both groups.

400299,Usefulness of the COVID-GRAM and CURB-65 scores for predicting severity in patients with COVID-19,2021,"Law enforcement and massive media awareness, limiting the anthropogenic disturbance, is the way to go for implementing successful desert native vegetation recovery plans. A lesson learned on the resiliency of desert ecosystems throughout studying the native vegetation coverage in the Wadi Al-Batin desert ecosystem during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wadi Al-Batin tri-state desert (89,315 km2) covers the South-western part of Iraq, State of Kuwait, and the North-eastern part of Saudi Arabia. In this study, the spatiotemporal changes in vegetation coverage was detected, by using Sentinel-2A imageries, during the period from 2017 to 2020. For better understanding the impact of associated law enforcement and media practices during COVID-19 pandemic, native vegetation coverage of years with relevant rainfall records were compared. The results revealed that despite receiving the least amount of rain of the three years (≤93 mm), the COVID-19 year (2020) had the highest native vegetation coverage at 28.5% compared with 6% in 2017, and 2% in 2018. These results prove that the main drivers of desert vegetation deterioration are anthropogenic activities, such as quarrying, overgrazing, distractive camping, and off-road vehicle movements. Moreover, the estimated 63% vegetation coverage in Wadi Al-Batin desert in 2019 assures the significant role of precipitation in desert vegetation recovery. This bulk increase in vegetation coverage detected during COVID-19 pandemic shows that the desert vegetation adapts to harsh environments (low rainfall) and rapidly recovers once the source of the disturbance was removed by enforcing the environmental rules. Thus, the protection of natural resources and ecosystems can be achieved through the synergy between governments and civil communities, including intensive awareness of environmental impacts via media, enforcing environmental regulations, and promoting regional collaboration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Al-Ali, Z.

400554,"Covid-19: Trump threatens to stop funding WHO amid ""China-centric"" claims",2020,"Changeux et al. (Changeux et al. C. R. Biol. 343:33-39.) recently suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and that such interactions may be involved in pathology and infectivity. This hypothesis is based on the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains a sequence motif similar to known nAChR antagonists. Here, we use molecular simulations of validated atomically detailed structures of nAChRs and of the spike to investigate the possible binding of the Y674-R685 region of the spike to nAChRs. We examine the binding of the Y674-R685 loop to three nAChRs, namely the human &#945;4ß2 and &#945;7 subtypes and the muscle-like &#945;ßÎ³Î´ receptor from Tetronarce californica. Our results predict that Y674-R685 has affinity for nAChRs. The region of the spike responsible for binding contains a PRRA motif, a four-residue insertion not found in other SARS-like coronaviruses. The conformational behavior of the bound Y674-R685 is highly dependent on the receptor subtype; it adopts extended conformations in the &#945;4ß2 and &#945;7 complexes but is more compact when bound to the muscle-like receptor. In the &#945;4ß2 and &#945;ßÎ³Î´ complexes, the interaction of Y674-R685 with the receptors forces the loop C region to adopt an open conformation, similar to other known nAChR antagonists. In contrast, in the &#945;7 complex, Y674-R685 penetrates deeply into the binding pocket in which it forms interactions with the residues lining the aromatic box, namely with TrpB, TyrC1, and TyrC2. Estimates of binding energy suggest that Y674-R685 forms stable complexes with all three nAChR subtypes. Analyses of simulations of the glycosylated spike show that the Y674-R685 region is accessible for binding. We suggest a potential binding orientation of the spike protein with nAChRs, in which they are in a nonparallel arrangement to one another.","Oliveira, A Sofia F; Ibarra, Amaurys Avila; Bermudez, Isabel; Casalino, Lorenzo; Gaieb, Zied; Shoemark, Deborah K; Gallagher, Timothy; Sessions, Richard B; Amaro, Rommie E; Mulholland, Adrian J",Biophys J,,571

As hospital systems run far over capacity, facing possible shortages of critical care medical resources and personal protective equipment as well as clinician deaths, the psychological stressors necessitate a strong well-being support model for staff. At the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) in New York City, health care workers have been heroically providing front-line care to COVID-19 patients while facing their own appropriate fears for their personal safety in the setting of contagion. This moral obligation cannot be burdened by unacceptable risks; the health system's full support is required to address the needs of its workforce.In this Invited Commentary, the authors describe how an MSHS Employee, Faculty, and Trainee Crisis Support Task Force-created in early March 2020 and composed of behavioral health, human resources, and well-being leaders from across the health system-used a rapid needs assessment model to capture the concerns of the workforce related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The task force identified 3 priority areas central to promoting and maintaining the well-being of the entire MSHS workforce during the pandemic: meeting basic daily needs; enhancing communications for delivery of current, reliable, and reassuring messages; and developing robust psychosocial and mental health support options. Using a work group strategy, the task force operationalized the roll-out of support initiatives for each priority area. Attending to the emotional well-being of health care workers has emerged as a central element in the MSHS COVID-19 response, which continues to be committed to the physical and emotional needs of a workforce that courageously faces this crisis.","Ripp, Jonathan; Peccoralo, Lauren; Charney, Dennis",Acad. med,,571

This research intended to develop a reliable convolutional-neural-network (CNN) model for the classification of COVID-19 from chest X-ray views. Moreover, it is aimed to prevent bias issues due to the database. Transfer learning-based CNN model was developed by using a sum of 1,218 chest X-ray images (CXIs) consisting of 368 COVID-19 pneumonia and 850 other pneumonia cases by pre-trained architectures, including DenseNet-201, ResNet-18, and SqueezeNet. The chest X-ray images were acquired from publicly available databases, and each individual image was carefully selected to prevent any bias problem. A stratified 5-fold cross-validation approach was utilized with a ratio of 90% for training and 10% for the testing (unseen folds), in which 20% of training data was used as a validation set to prevent overfitting problems. The binary classification performances of the proposed CNN models were evaluated by the testing data. The activation mapping approach was implemented to improve the causality and visuality of the radiograph. The outcomes demonstrated that the proposed CNN model built on DenseNet-201 architecture outperformed amongst the others with the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores of 94.96%, 89.74%, 94.59%, and 92.11%, respectively. The results indicated that the reliable diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia from CXIs based on the CNN model opens the door to accelerate triage, save critical time, and prioritize resources besides assisting the radiologists.","Alhudhaif, Adi Polat Kemal Karaman Onur",Expert Systems with Applications,,571

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the intermittent irradiation of 222 nm UVC on SARS-CoV-2 and the fluence-dependent effect of 222 nm UVC irradiation on SARS-CoV-2 inactivation. METHODS: We experimented with 5 min continuous and intermittent irradiation for 0.1, 0.05, 0.013, and 0.003 mW/cm2 of 222 nm UVC to evaluate the differences in the effect of the continuous and intermittent irradiation of 222 nm UVC on SARS-CoV-2 inactivation. For intermittent irradiation, we followed the on-off irradiation cycles with every 10-s irradiation followed by a 380-s interval. Thereafter, we evaluated the effects of 0.1, 0.013, and 0.003 mW/cm2 222 nm UVC irradiation on SARS-CoV-2 contamination at UV fluences of 1, 2, and 3 mJ/cm2 at each irradiance. RESULTS: At each irradiance, no significant difference was observed in the log reduction of SARS-CoV-2 between continuous and intermittent irradiation. At each UV fluence, no significant difference was observed in the log reduction of SARS-CoV-2 among the three different irradiance levels. CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference between continuous and intermittent irradiation with 222 nm UVC with regards to SARS-CoV-2 inactivation. Moreover, 222 nm UVC inactivates SARS-CoV-2 in a fluence-dependent manner. The efficacy of 222-nm UVC irradiation in reducing the contamination of SARS-CoV-2 needs to be further evaluated in a real-world setting.","Kitagawa, Hiroki; Nomura, Toshihito; Nazmul, Tanuza; Kawano, Reo; Omori, Keitaro; Shigemoto, Norifumi; Sakaguchi, Takemasa; Ohge, Hiroki",Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther,,571

Recent research has shown the effectiveness of this solution, particularly when used in conjunction with manual tracking. Nonetheless, the contact tracing app raises concerns due to the potential privacy implications. The authors have delved into the European legislation that protects privacy through the principles of proportionality and minimization, arguing that in order to quickly resolve the pandemic caused by COVID-19, one cannot blindly trust the exclusive help of technology.

Against the backdrop of policy proposals for EU joint procurement of medicines, this article expands our understanding of public opinion towards this particular aspect of European integration. Drawing on data from a conjoint experiment in five EU countries, the study investigates the extent to which citizens’ preferences concerning alternative policy designs for EU joint procurement of medicines are either structured along a pro-EU versus anti-EU or ideological divide, or are crisis driven by the perceived COVID-19 threat. The analysis reveals that individual preferences over the design of EU risk pooling for medicines are most strongly explained by Euroscepticism, while egalitarian ideology plays only a modest role. How citizens’ perceived threat of COVID-19 affects their preferences for this form of EU risk pooling is dependent on the national context.

The response was slow, mired in ad hoc responses, lack of planning, challenges in supply chains and human resources, and discord in balancing public health measures with economic considerations arising from far-reaching disruptions in various sectors. The lessons learned derive from such challenges. Until protective vaccines and effective therapeutics are developed, communities need to embrace basic hygiene, face covering, physical distancing, avoidance of congested settings or closed environments, and protecting the vulnerable. Further spread would continue, but the current surge waves would ultimately run their course, although endemicity and scattered outbreaks would persist.

402051,COVID-19 epidemiology in Canada from January to December 2020: the pre-vaccine era,2021,"Coagulation disorders, endotheliopathy and inflammation are the most common hallmarks in SARS-CoV-2 infection, largely determining COVID-19's outcome and severity. Dysfunctions of endothelial cells and platelets are tightly linked in contributing to the systemic inflammatory response that appears to be both a cause and a consequence of COVID-19-associated coagulation disorders and thrombotic events. Indeed, elevated levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines are often associated with abnormal coagulation parameters in COVID-19 patients. Although treatments with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) have shown beneficial effects in decreasing patient mortality with severe COVID-19, additional therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Utilizing the anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties of natural compounds may provide alternative therapeutic approaches to prevent or reduce the risk factors associated with pre-existing conditions and comorbidities that can worsen COVID-19 patients' outcomes. In this regard, resveratrol, a natural compound found in several plants and fruits such as grapes, blueberries and cranberries, may represent a promising coadjuvant for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. By virtue of its anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties, resveratrol would be expected to lower COVID-19-associated mortality, which is well known to be increased by thrombosis and inflammation. This review analyzes and discusses resveratrol's ability to modulate vascular hemostasis at different levels targeting both primary hemostasis (interfering with platelet activation and aggregation) and secondary hemostasis (modulating factors involved in coagulation cascade).","Giordo, Roberta; Zinellu, Angelo; Eid, Ali Hussein; Pintus, Gianfranco",Molecules (Basel),,571

Our objectives were to investigate which classes of obesity are associated with higher in-hospital mortality and to assess the association between obesity and systemic inflammation. This was a retrospective study which included consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a tertiary center. Three thousand five hundred thirty patients were included in this analysis (female sex: 1579, median age: 65 years). The median body mass index (BMI) was 28.8 kg/m2. In the overall cohort, a J-shaped association between BMI and in-hospital mortality was depicted. In the subgroup of men, BMI 35-39.9 kg/m2 and BMI &#8805;40 kg/m2 were found to have significant association with higher in-hospital mortality, while only BMI &#8805;40 kg/m2 was found significant in the subgroup of women. No significant association between BMI and IL-6 was noted. Obesity classes II and III in men and obesity class III in women were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. The male population with severe obesity was the one that mainly drove this association.

Because of the novelty of the virus, there are currently no SARS-CoV-2-specific treatments or vaccines available. Therefore, rapid development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed. Here, we developed a pilot-scale production of PiCoVacc, a purified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine candidate, which induced SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, rats, and nonhuman primates. These antibodies neutralized 10 representative SARS-CoV-2 strains, suggesting a possible broader neutralizing ability against other strains. Three immunizations using two different doses, 3 or 6 micrograms per dose, provided partial or complete protection in macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, respectively, without observable antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. These data support the clinical development and testing of PiCoVacc for use in humans.","Gao, Qiang; Bao, Linlin; Mao, Haiyan; Wang, Lin; Xu, Kangwei; Yang, Minnan; Li, Yajing; Zhu, Ling; Wang, Nan; Lv, Zhe; Gao, Hong; Ge, Xiaoqin; Kan, Biao; Hu, Yaling; Liu, Jiangning; Cai, Fang; Jiang, Deyu; Yin, Yanhui; Qin, Chengfeng; Li, Jing; Gong, Xuejie; Lou, Xiuyu; Shi, Wen; Wu, Dongdong; Zhang, Hengming; Zhu, Lang; Deng, Wei; Li, Yurong; Lu, Jinxing; Li, Changgui; Wang, Xiangxi; Yin, Weidong; Zhang, Yanjun; Qin, Chuan",Science,,571
402972,Older people and technology: Time to smarten up our act,2021,"PURPOSE: TMPRSS2 is a host co-receptor for cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. A prior report suggested that use of androgen deprivation therapy, which downregulates TMPRSS2, may protect men with prostate cancer from infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cohort study of a prospective registry of all patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March 12 and June 10, 2020, with complete followup until disease recovery or death. The main exposure examined was the use of androgen deprivation therapy, and the outcome measures were the rate of SARS-CoV-2 positivity and disease severity as a function of androgen deprivation therapy use. RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 1,779 men with prostate cancer from a total tested population of 74,787, of whom 4,885 (6.5%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of those with prostate cancer 102 (5.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 304 (17.1%) were on androgen deprivation therapy. Among those on androgen deprivation therapy 5.6% were positive as compared to 5.8% not on androgen deprivation therapy. Men on androgen deprivation therapy were slightly older (75.5 vs 73.8 years, p=0.009), more likely to have smoked (68.1% vs 59.3%, p=0.005) and more likely to report taking steroids (43.8% vs 23.3%, p <0.001). Other factors known to increase risk of infection and disease severity were equally distributed (asthma, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure and immune suppressive disease). Multivariable analysis did not indicate a difference in infection risk for those with prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.54-1.61, p=0.8). CONCLUSIONS: Androgen deprivation therapy does not appear to be protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Klein, Eric A; Li, Jianbo; Milinovich, Alex; Schold, Jesse D; Sharifi, Nima; Kattan, Michael W; Jehi, Lara",J Urol,,571

Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 disease may differ, most cases are mild, but a significant minority of patients may develop moderate to severe respiratory symptoms, with the most severe cases requiring intensive care and/or mechanical ventilatory support. In this study, we aimed to identify validity of our modified scoring system for foreseeing the approach to the COVID-19 patient and the disease, the treatment plan, the severity of morbidity and even the risk of mortality from the clinician's point of view. In this single center study, we examined the patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 between 01/04/2020 and 01/06/2020, of the 228 patients who were between 20 and 90 years of age, and whose polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests of nasal and pharyngeal swab samples were positive. We evaulated 228 (92 male and 136 female) PCR (+) patients. Univariate analysis showed that advanced age (p < 0.001), hemoglobin (p < 0.001), troponin-I (p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p < 0.001), fibrinogen (p < 0.001), HT (p = 0.01), CAD (p = 0.001), DM (p < 0.001), history of malignancy (p = 0.008), along with m-sPESI scores (p < 0.001) were significantly higher in patients that needed intensive care due to COVID-19 infection. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, only the m-sPESI score higher than &#8805; 2 was found to be highly significant in terms of indicating the need for ICU admission (AUC 0.948; 84.6% sensitivity and 94.6% specificity) (p < 0.001). With an increasing number of hospitalized patients, healthcare providers are confronting a deluge of lab results in the process of caring for COVID-19 patients. It is imperative to identify risk factors for mortality and morbidity development. The modified sPESI scoring system, which we put forward, is successful in predicting the course of the disease at the presentation of the patient with COVID-19 disease and predicting the need for intensive care with high specificity and sensitivity, can detect the need for intensive care with high specificity and sensitivity.","As, Ahmet Kagan; Erdolu, Burak; Duman, Burak; Yazgan, Elif; Eris, Cuneyt; Aydin, Ufuk; Ata, Yusuf; Sengoren Dikis, Ozlem; Türk, Tamer",J. thromb. thrombolysis,,571

The aim of the present study was to explore the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and dreaming in adolescents. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Italy, Romania and Croatia involving 2,105 secondary school students (69% girls, mean age 15.6 +/- 2.1 years;31% boys, mean age 15.1 +/- 2.2 years;mean age of whole sample 15.4 +/- 2.1 years). No substantial differences between countries were found. Thirty-one percent of the participants reported heightened dream recall, 18% noticed an increase in nightmares during the lockdown, and 15% of the provided dreams (n = 498) included pandemic-related content. The results indicate that subjective emotional reactions to lockdown had a significantly higher correlation to dreaming than objective distress (i.e., illness or death of a close one because of COVID-19). These findings suggest that attention to dreams should be included in preventive programs for adolescents with pandemic-related stress.","Guerrero-Gomez, A.; Nothen-Garunja, I.; Schredl, M.; Homberg, A.; Vulcan, M.; Brusic, A.; Bonizzi, C.; Iannaco, C.",Frontiers in Psychology,,571

Here we employed electroencephalography to investigate neural representations of predictions and prediction errors in heat and pain processing. Our data show that alpha-to-beta activity was associated with stimulus intensity expectation, followed by a negative modulation of gamma band activity by absolute prediction errors. This is in contrast to prediction errors in visual and auditory perception, which are associated with increased gamma band activity, but is in agreement with observations in working memory and word matching, which show gamma band activity for correct, rather than violated predictions.","Strube, Andreas; Rose, Michael; Fazeli, Sepideh; Büchel, Christian",eLife (Cambridge),,571

Here, we focus on geographic disparities in incidence within Portugal for three age groups of women (30-49; 50-69; 70-84 years). METHODS: Age-period-cohort (APC) models are widely used in cancer surveillance, and these models have recently been extended to allow spatially-varying effects. We apply novel spatial APC models to estimate relative risk and age-adjusted temporal trends at the district level for the 20 districts in Portugal. Our model allows us to report on country-wide trends, but also to investigate geographic disparities between districts and trends within districts. RESULTS: Age-adjusted breast cancer incidence was increasing over 1998-2011 for all three age groups and in every district in Portugal. However, we detect spatially-structured between-district heterogeneity in relative risk and age-adjusted trends (Net Drifts) for each of the three age groups, which is most pronounced in the highly-screened (50-69yo) and late-onset (70-84yo) groups of women. CONCLUSIONS: We present evidence of disparities in breast cancer incidence at a more granular geographic level than previously reported. Some disparities may be due to latent risk factors, which cannot be accounted for by age, birth year, and geographic location alone. IMPACT: Our study motivates resuming data collection for breast cancer incidence at the district level in Portugal, as well as the study of exogenous risk factors.","Froelicher, Joseph H; Forjaz, Gonçalo; Rosenberg, Philip S; Chernyavskiy, Pavel",Cancer Epidemiol,,571

However, there is a lack of research on the efficacy of this method in Iran. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of tele-nursing on supportive care needs (SCNs) of patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted on 60 patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy who were randomly assigned and allocated to two groups, an intervention group and a control group. Patients' SCNs were assessed in the baseline, and 1 and 2 months after commencement of the intervention using the SCNs Survey -Short Form 34. The data were analyzed through descriptive statistics, t-test, and repeated measure test, by SPSS version 16. RESULTS: There were no significant statistical differences in the mean score of dimensions and total SCNs between the two groups in baseline (pË0.05). However, the results showed that the mean score of dimensions and total SCNs in the intervention group were significantly less than the control group, after the intervention (pË0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Telephone-based support is an effective method to address and reduce SCNs of patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy through increasing access to support for this population especially who may be in rural and remote settings. During the COVID_19 pandemic and given the vulnerability of patients with cancer, telephone support can be used to avoid unnecessary visits to hospitals and reduced the risk of transmitting the virus to the patients.

We examined how hybrid rounds with virtual communication added to in-person rounds could facilitate social distancing while maintaining patient-centered care. DESIGN: Continuous quality improvement. SETTING: Quaternary care referral pediatric hospital. PATIENTS: Daytime rounds conducted on PICU patients. INTERVENTIONS: Following a needs assessment survey and pilot trials, multiple technological solutions were implemented in a series of plan-do-study-act cycles. Hybrid rounds model was deployed where a videoconference platform was used to establish communication between the bedside personnel (nurse, patient/family, and partial ICU team) with remotely located remaining ICU team, ancillary, and consultant providers. Floor labels marking 6-feet distance were placed for rounders. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Outcome metrics included compliance with social distancing, mixed methods analysis of surveys, direct interviews of providers and families, and reports of safety concerns. The clinicians adopted hybrid rounds readily. Compliance with social distancing and use of floor labels needed reminders. One-hundred fourteen providers completed the feedback survey. Twenty-five providers and 11 families were interviewed. Feedback about hybrid rounds included inability to teach effectively, suboptimal audio-video quality, loss of situational awareness of patient/unit acuity, alarm interference, and inability to socially distance during other ICU interactions. Benefits noted were improved ancillary input, fewer interruptions, improved efficiency, opportunity to integrate with data platforms, and engage remote consultants and families. Nurses and families appreciated the efforts to ensure safety but wanted the ICU attending/fellow supervising the team to participate at bedside, during rounds. Clinicians appreciated the multidisciplinary input but felt that teaching was difficult. CONCLUSIONS: Hybrid rounds employed during pandemic facilitated social distancing while retaining patient-centered multidisciplinary ICU rounds but compromised teaching during rounds. A change to ingrained rounding habits needs team commitment and ongoing optimization. The hybrid rounds model has potential for generalizability to other settings.","Bavare, Aarti C; Goldman, Jordana R; Musick, Matthew A; Sembera, Kerry A; Sardual, Alex A; Lam, Anne K; Tume, Sebastian C; Thammasitboon, Satid X; Williams, Eric A",Pediatric critical care medicine,,571

405675,The University in the CORONACENO (Post-COVID-19) era/ La Universidad en el CORONACENO (post COVID-19),2020,"BACKGROUND: Diagnostic methods for Covid-19 have improved, both in speed and availability. Because of atypical and asymptomatic carriage of the virus and nosocomial spread within institutions, timely diagnosis remains a challenge. Machine learning models trained on blood test results have shown promise in identifying cases of Covid-19. AIMS: To train and validate a machine learning model capable of differentiating Covid-19 positive from negative patients using routine blood tests and assess the model's accuracy against atypical and asymptomatic presentations. DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of medical admissions to our institution during March and April 2020. Participants were categorised into Covid-19 positive or negative groups based on clinical, radiological features or nasopharyngeal swab. A machine learning model was trained on laboratory parameters and validated for accuracy, sensitivity and specificity and externally validated at an unconnected establishment. RESULTS: An Ensemble Bagged Tree model was trained on data collected from 405 patients (212 Covid-19 positive) producing accuracy of 81.79% (95% confidence interval (CI) 77.53% to 85.55%), sensitivity of 85.85% (CI 80.42% to 90.24%) and specificity of 76.65% (CI 69.49% to 82.84%). Accuracy was preserved for atypical and asymptomatic subgroups. Using an external data set for 226 patients (141 Covid-19 positive) accuracy of 76.82% (CI 70.87% to 82.08%), sensitivity of 78.38% (CI 70.87% to 84.72%) and specificity of 74.12% (CI 63.48% to 83.01%) was achieved. CONCLUSION: A machine learning model using routine laboratory parameters can detect atypical and asymptomatic presentations of Covid-19, and might be an adjunct to existing screening measures.","Baktash, Vadir; Hosack, Tom; Rule, Rory; Patel, Nishil; Kho, Jason; Sekhar, Ravi; Mandal, Amit K J; Missouris, Constantinos G",QJM,,571
405809,Urban governance innovation and COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: AirSeal® is a valve-free insufflation system that enables a stable pneumoperitoneum with continuous smoke evacuation and CO2 recirculation during laparoscopic surgery. Comparative evidence on the use of AirSeal® and standard CO2 insufflator in laparoscopic general surgery procedures is scarce. The aim of this study was to compare surgical outcomes between AirSeal® and standard CO2 insufflators in patients undergoing the most frequently performed laparoscopic procedures. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-eight patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, colorectal surgery and hernia repair were randomized to either AirSeal® (group A) or standard pressure CO2 insufflator (group S). The primary endpoints were operative time and level of postoperative shoulder tip pain (Visual Analog Scale). Secondary outcomes included Clavien-Dindo grade complications, surgical side effect and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Patients were randomized to either group A (n = 101) or group S (n = 97) and were analyzed by intention-to-treat. There was no significant difference in mean operative time between the groups (median [IQR]; 71 min [56-94] in group A vs. 69 min [52-93] in group S; p = 0.434). Shoulder tip pain levels were significantly lower in group S (VAS 0 [0-3] in group S vs. 2 [0-4] in group A; p = 0.001). There was no significant difference in complications, surgical side effects (subcutaneous emphysema was not observed in any group) and length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION: This randomized controlled trial showed that using the AirSeal® system did not reduce operative time and was associated with a higher postoperative shoulder tip pain compared to standard CO2 insufflator for short elective surgeries.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This descriptive study of the opinions of Tunisian experts covered all orthopedic morbidities classified into three homogeneous groups: trauma, infections and tumors of the musculoskeletal system. The attitudes of the interviewees were collected using the ""Delphi"" method, using a ""Google-Form"" questionnaire, sent by email to all of the Tunisian university orthopedic surgeons in practice, and registered at the SOTCOT. Consensus has been established for an item, if validated by at least 80% of the experts. The analysis of the results focused on the first 30 responses to this ""online"" form. RESULTS: Tunisian experts agreed on the continuity of the urgency of taking in charge all the items of orthopedic morbidity during the COVID-19 pandemic, apart from the following affections: aseptic nonunions in the upper and lower limbs, aggressive giant cell tumors, and hyperalgesic disc herniations, where agreement rates were only at 8%, 12%, 58% and 77%.

407457,COVID-19 and Ludhiana's woolen knitwear industry: way forward,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Strict lockdown rules were imposed to the French population from 17 March to 11 May 2020, which may result in limited possibilities of physical activity, modified psychological and health states. This report is focused on HRV parameters kinetics before, during and after this lockdown period. METHODS: 95 participants were included in this study (27 women, 68 men, 37 ± 11 years, 176 ± 8 cm, 71 ± 12 kg), who underwent regular orthostatic tests (a 5-minute supine followed by a 5-minute standing recording of heart rate (HR)) on a regular basis before (BSL), during (CFN) and after (RCV) the lockdown. HR, power in low- and high-frequency bands (LF, HF, respectively) and root mean square of the successive differences (RMSSD) were computed for each orthostatic test, and for each position. Subjective well-being was assessed on a 0-10 visual analogic scale (VAS). The participants were split in two groups, those who reported an improved well-being (WB+, increase >2 in VAS score) and those who did not (WB-) during CFN. RESULTS: Out of the 95 participants, 19 were classified WB+ and 76 WB-. There was an increase in HR and a decrease in RMSSD when measured supine in CFN and RCV, compared to BSL in WB-, whilst opposite results were found in WB+ (i.e. decrease in HR and increase in RMSSD in CFN and RCV; increase in LF and HF in RCV). When pooling data of the three phases, there were significant correlations between VAS and HR, RMSSD, HF, respectively, in the supine position; the higher the VAS score (i.e., subjective well-being), the higher the RMSSD and HF and the lower the HR. In standing position, HRV parameters were not modified during CFN but RMSSD was correlated to VAS. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the strict COVID-19 lockdown likely had opposite effects on French population as 20% of participants improved parasympathetic activation (RMSSD, HF) and rated positively this period, whilst 80% showed altered responses and deteriorated well-being. The changes in HRV parameters during and after the lockdown period were in line with subjective well-being responses. The observed recordings may reflect a large variety of responses (anxiety, anticipatory stress, change on physical activity ) beyond the scope of the present study. However, these results confirmed the usefulness of HRV as a non-invasive means for monitoring well-being and health in this population.","Bourdillon, Nicolas; Yazdani, Sasan; Schmitt, Laurent; Millet, Grégoire P",PLoS One,,571

We sought to explore the outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients treated with a multi-mechanism approach (MMA) in addition to standard-of-care (SC) versus patients who only received SC treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively for patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). This observational cohort study was performed at five institutions, 3 in the United States and 2 in Honduras. Patients were stratified for MMA vs. SC treatment during ICU stay. MMA treatment consists of widely available medications started immediately upon hospitalization. These interventions target immunomodulation, anticoagulation, viral suppression, and oxygenation. Primary outcomes included in-hospital mortality and length of stay (LOS) for the index hospitalization and were measured using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 86 patients admitted, 65 (76%) who had severe COVID-19 were included in the study; 30 (46%) patients were in SC group, compared with 35 (54%) patients treated with MMA group. Twelve (40%) patients in the SC group died, compared with 5 (14%) in the MMA group (p-value = 0.01, Chi squared test). After adjustment for gender, age, treatment group, Q-SOFA score, the MMA group had a mean length of stay 8.15 days, when compared with SC group with 13.55 days. ICU length of stay was reduced by a mean of 5.4 days (adjusted for a mean age of 54 years, p-value 0.03) and up to 9 days (unadjusted for mean age), with no significant reduction in overall adjusted mortality rate, where the strongest predictor of mortality was the use of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: The finding that MMA decreases the average ICU length of stay by 5.4 days and up to 9 days in older patients suggests that implementation of this treatment protocol could allow a healthcare system to manage 60% more COVID-19 patients with the same number of ICU beds.","Valerio Pascua, Fernando; Diaz, Oscar; Medina, Rina; Contreras, Brian; Mistroff, Jeff; Espinosa, Daniel; Sekhon, Anupamjeet; Paz Handal, Diego; Pineda, Estela; Vargas Pineda, Miguel; Pineda, Hector; Diaz, Maribel; Lewis, Anita S; Hesse, Heike; Castro Lainez, Miriams T; Stevens, Mark L; Sierra-Hoffman, Miguel; Ontai, Sidney C; VanBuren, Vincent",PLoS One,,571

In addition to the person-to person transmission dynamic of the novel respiratory virus, it has been recently studied the role of environmental factors in accelerate SARS-CoV-2 spread and its lethality. The time being, air pollution has been identified as the largest environmental cause of disease and premature death in the world. It affects body's immunity, making people more vulnerable to pathogens. The hypothesis that air pollution, resulting from a combination of factors such as meteorological data, level of industrialization as well as regional topography, can acts both as a carrier of the infection and as a worsening factor of the health impact of COVID-19 disease, has been raised recently. With this review, we want to provide an update state of art relating the role of air pollution, in particular PM2.5, PM10 and NO2, in COVID-19 spread and lethality. The Authors, who first investigated this association, often used different research methods or not all include confounding factors whenever possible. In addition, to date incidence data are underestimated in all countries and to a lesser extent also mortality data. For this reason, the cases included in the reviewed studies cannot be considered conclusive. Although it determines important limitations for direct comparison of results, and more studies are needed to strengthen scientific evidences and support firm conclusions, major findings are consistent, highlighting the important contribution of PM2.5 and NO2 as triggering of the COVID-19 spread and lethality, and with a less extent also PM10, although the potential effect of airborne virus exposure it has not been still demonstrated.","Copat, Chiara; Cristaldi, Antonio; Fiore, Maria; Grasso, Alfina; Zuccarello, Pietro; Signorelli, Salvatore Santo; Conti, Gea Oliveri; Ferrante, Margherita",Environ Res,,571

METHODS: This was a prospective observational cohort study of patients confirmed to have COVID-19 who required mechanical ventilation at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK. The primary outcome measure was 30-day survival, accounting for severe organ dysfunction (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health [APACHE]-II score>17). Secondary outcomes included duration of ventilation, ICU stay, and healthcare workers directly involved in tracheostomy care acquiring COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 164 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the ICU between March 9, 2020 and April 21, 2020. A total of 100 patients (mean [standard deviation] age: 55 [12] yr; 29% female) underwent tracheostomy; 64 (age: 57 [14] yr; 25% female) did not undergo tracheostomy. Despite similar APACHE-II scores, 30-day survival was higher in 85/100 (85%) patients after tracheostomy, compared with 27/64 (42%) non-tracheostomised patients {relative risk: 3.9 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 2.3-6.4); P<0.0001}.

COVID-19 Lockdowns and Venture Capital Investment (preprint),2021,"Introduction: In addition to hand washing and wearing masks, social distancing and reducing exposure time to <15 minutes are the most effective measures against the spread of COVID-19. Unfortunately, three of these guidelines are very difficult, if not impossible, for nursing babies: they cannot wear masks, stay six feet away from the lactating breasts, nor consistently finish within 15 minutes while nursing. We report a case of a nursing mother with SARS-CoV-2 infection, documenting changes of immune cells and cytokines in breast milk with and without the infection. Case Description: With Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, we obtained expressed breast milk samples from a lactating mother before and during SARS-CoV-2 infection as documented by reverse transcription-PCR. Using flow cytometry analysis, we measured the immune cell profiles and expression of cytokines such as interferon alpha (IFN&#945;) in milk leukocytes before and during infection. Results: There was an eightfold increase in IFN&#945;+ milk leukocytes, from 1% before SARS-CoV-2 infection to 8% when actively infected. The milk macrophages showed the highest increase in IFN&#945; expression. Both T and B lymphocytes showed mild increase. Innate lymphoid cells, neutrophils, and natural killer cells showed no increase in IFN&#945; expression and the dendritic cells actually showed a reduction. Conclusion: We document the presence and high expression of IFN&#945; in the breast milk macrophages of a lactating mother with confirmed COVID-19, compared with her milk before the infection.","Yu, Jack C; Khodadadi, Hesam; Salles, Évila Lopes; Pham, Quyen; Patel, Pinkal; Baban, Babak",Breastfeed Med,,571

413125,"Estimation of COVID-19-induced depletion of hospital resources in Ontario, Canada",2020,"Few studies have focused on the transmission efficiency of asymptomatic carriers of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Our follow-up study was performed on 147 asymptomatic carriers in Anhui Province. Of these, 50.0% were male, 50.3% were older than 40 years, 43.8% were farmers, and 68.7% were from the north of Anhui Province. 16 of the 147 asymptomatic carriers developed symptoms in the following 14 days of isolated observation, and were subsequently diagnosed as confirmed cases. The possible latent infection period was found to range from 1-5 days before onset, with a median time of 2 days. The second attack rate for the 16 confirmed cases who had transferred from being asymptomatic carriers was 9.7% (23/236 close contacts), while for the 131 asymptomatic carriers the rate was 2.6% (24/914 close contacts), showing a significant difference in second attack rate between the two groups (pï¼0.001). Our study indicated that COVID-19 cases are contagious during the incubation period, and that close contact screening should be extended to include the incubation period. Our results also showed that the transmission efficiency for asymptomatic carriers was lower than that for confirmed case.","Liu, Zhirong; Chu, Ruilin; Gong, Lei; Su, Bin; Wu, Jiabing",Int J Infect Dis,,571

413506,COVID-19 is the only issue that will matter in 2021,2021,"AIMS: COVID-19 is especially severe for elderly subjects with cardiometabolic and respiratory comorbidities. Neck circumference (NC) has been shown to be strongly related to cardiometabolic and respiratory illnesses even after adjustment for body mass index (BMI). We performed a prospective study to investigate the potential of NC to predict the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in adult COVID-19 inpatients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively and consecutively enrolled COVID-19 adult patients admitted to dedicated medical wards of two Italian hospitals from 25 March to 7 April 2020. On admission, clinical, biochemical and anthropometric data, including BMI and NC were collected. As primary outcome measure, the maximum respiratory support received was evaluated. Follow-up time was 30 days from hospital admission. RESULTS: We enrolled 132 subjects (55.0-75.8 years, 32% female). During the study period, 26 (19.7%) patients underwent IMV. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, after adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, hypertension and COPD, NC resulted independently and significantly associated with IMV risk (adjusted OR 1.260-per 1 cm increase 95% CI:1.120-1.417; P < .001), with a stronger association in the subgroup with BMI &#8804;30 Kg/m2 (adjusted OR 1.526; 95% CI:1.243-1.874; P < .001). NC showed a good discrimination power in predicting patients requiring IMV (AUC 0.783; 95% CI:0.684-0.882; P < .001). In particular, NC > 40.5 cm (>37.5 for females and >42.5 for males) showed a higher and earlier IMV risk compared to subjects with lower NC (Log-rank test: P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: NC is an easy to measure parameter able to predict the need for IMV in adult COVID-19 inpatients.","Di Bella, Stefano; Cesareo, Roberto; De Cristofaro, Paolo; Palermo, Andrea; Sanson, Gianfranco; Roman-Pognuz, Erik; Zerbato, Verena; Manfrini, Silvia; Giacomazzi, Donatella; Dal Bo, Eugenia; Sambataro, Gianluca; Macchini, Elisabetta; Quintavalle, Francesco; Campagna, Giuseppe; Masala, Renato; Ottaviani, Luigi; Del Borgo, Cosmo; Ridola, Lorenzo; Leonetti, Frida; Berlot, Giorgio; Luzzati, Roberto",Diabetes Metab Res Rev,,571
413766,Facile Determination of COVID-19 Seroconversion via Nonradiative Energy Transfer,2021,"The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has brought the entire world to a standstill. The rapid pace at which the virus has spread across the world is unprecedented. The sheer number of infected cases and fatalities in such a short period of time has overwhelmed medical facilities across the globe. The rapid pace of the spread of the novel coronavirus makes it imperative that its' spread be forecasted well in advance in order to plan for eventualities. An accurate early forecasting of the number of cases would certainly assist governments and various other organizations to strategize and prepare for the newly infected cases, well in advance. In this work, a novel method of forecasting the future cases of infection, based on the study of data mined from the internet search terms of people in the affected region, is proposed. The study utilizes relevant Google Trends of specific search terms related to COVID-19 pandemic along with European Centre for Disease prevention and Control (ECDC) data on COVID-19 spread, to forecast the future trends of daily new cases, cumulative cases and deaths for India, USA and UK. For this purpose, a hybrid GWO-LSTM model is developed, where the network parameters of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network are optimized using Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). The results of the proposed model are compared with the baseline models including Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and it is observed that the proposed model achieves much better results in forecasting the future trends of the spread of infection. Using the proposed hybrid GWO-LSTM model incorporating online big data from Google Trends, a reduction in Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values for forecasting results to the extent of about 98% have been observed. Further, reduction in MAPE by 74% for models incorporating Google Trends was observed, thus, confirming the efficacy of utilizing public sentiments in terms of search frequencies of relevant terms online, in forecasting pandemic numbers.","Prasanth, Sikakollu; Singh, Uttam; Kumar, Arun; Tikkiwal, Vinay Anand; Chong, Peter H J",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,571

In addition to instituting the need to evaluate old methods of disease prevention. This study aimed to analyze the aspects related to biosafety and the health conditions of health professionals in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: In this narrative review, articles were searched in various databases, organizations, and health entities using keywords compatible with MeSH, including COVID-19, Pandemia, Health professionals, Coronavirus 2019, SARS-CoV-2, personal protective equipment (PPE), Biosafety. Results and Discussion: The review of articles and manuals published in this area revealed that health professionals are being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and effective prevention measures and the correct use of PPE are needed, in addition to health assessment and monitoring, including mental health, of these professionals. Conclusion: There is a lack of data on which PPE may have the best protective effect against SARS-CoV-2, as well as how to use, remove, disinfect, store and replace it. It is essential to offer support to health professionals, both the provision of PPE, as well as in training and maintenance of mental health to reduce the adverse effects that this pandemic can generate in this population.","Godoi, Ana Paula Nogueira; Bernardes, Gilcelia Correia Santos; Novais, Rommel Larcher Rachid; Nogueira, Leilismara Sousa; Pinheiro, Melina de Barros",Rev.

Due to the rapid spread of the virus and limited availability of effective treatments, health and social care systems worldwide quickly became overwhelmed. Such stressful circumstances are likely to have negative impacts on health and social care workers' wellbeing. The current study examined the relationship between coping strategies and wellbeing and quality of working life in nurses, midwives, allied health professionals, social care workers and social workers who worked in health and social care in the UK during its first wave of COVID-19. Data were collected using an anonymous online survey (N = 3425), and regression analyses were used to examine the associations of coping strategies and demographic characteristics with staff wellbeing and quality of working life. The results showed that positive coping strategies, particularly active coping and help-seeking, were associated with higher wellbeing and better quality of working life. Negative coping strategies, such as avoidance, were risk factors for low wellbeing and worse quality of working life. The results point to the importance of organizational and management support during stressful times, which could include psycho-education and training about active coping and might take the form of workshops designed to equip staff with better coping skills.","McFadden, Paula; Ross, Jana; Moriarty, John; Mallett, John; Schroder, Heike; Ravalier, Jermaine; Manthorpe, Jill; Currie, Denise; Harron, Jaclyn; Gillen, Patricia",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,571

Castor bean (Ricinus communis) is a typical woody oilseed crop. We performed cytological observations within xylem, phloem and cambia tissues, revealing that divergent cell growth in all tissues might play a role in the dwarf phenotype in cultivated castor bean. Based on bulked segregant analyses for a F2 population generated from the crossing of a tall and a dwarf accession, we identified two QTLs associated with plant height, covering 325 candidate genes. One of these, Rc5NG4-1 encoding a putative IAA transport protein localized in the tonoplast was functionally characterized. A non-synonymous SNP (altering the amino acid sequence from Y to C at position 218) differentiated the tall and dwarf plants and we confirmed, through heterologous yeast transformation, that the IAA uptake capacities of Rc5NG4-1Y and Rc5NG4-1C were significantly different. This study provides insights into the physiological and molecular mechanisms of dwarfing in woody non-timber economically important plants, with potential to aid in the genetic breeding of castor bean and other related crops.","Wang, Zaiqing; Yu, Anmin; Li, Fei; Xu, Wei; Han, Bing; Cheng, Xiaomao; Liu, Aizhong",Sci Rep,,571

To date, only a minority of PDGFRA-mutant patients treated with avapritinib have developed secondary resistance. Tumor and plasma biopsies in 6 of 7 patients with PDGFRA primary mutations who progressed on avapritinib or imatinib had secondary resistance mutations within PDGFRA exons 13, 14 and 15 that interfere with avapritinib binding. Secondary PDGFRA mutations causing V658A, N659K, Y676C, and G680R substitutions were found in 2 or more patients each, representing recurrent mechanisms of PDGFRA GIST drug resistance.

DESIGN: A phone survey administered between August and October 2020 to participants of a population-based longitudinal cohort study established in 2002 comprising two cohorts born in 1994-1995 and 2001-2002 in Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana), Peru and Vietnam. We use logistic regressions to examine associations between mental health and pandemic-related stressors, structural factors (gender, age), and lifelong protective/risk factors (parent and peer relationship, wealth, long-term health problems, past emotional problems, subjective well-being) measured at younger ages. SETTING: A geographically diverse, poverty-focused sample, also reaching those without mobile phones or internet access. PARTICIPANTS: 10 496 individuals were approached; 9730 participated. Overall, 8988 individuals were included in this study; 4610 (51%) men and 4378 (49%) women. Non-inclusion was due to non-location or missing data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Symptoms consistent with at least mild anxiety or depression were measured by Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (&#8805;5) or Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (&#8805;5). RESULTS: Rates of symptoms of at least mild anxiety (depression) were highest in Peru at 41% (32%) (95% CI 38.63% to 43.12%; (29.49-33.74)), and lowest in Vietnam at 9% (9%) (95% CI 8.16% to 10.58%; (8.33-10.77)), mirroring COVID-19 mortality rates. Women were most affected in all countries except Ethiopia. Pandemic-related stressors such as health risks/expenses, economic adversity, food insecurity, and educational or employment disruption were risk factors for anxiety and depression, though showed varying levels of importance across countries. Prior parent/peer relationships were protective factors, while long-term health or emotional problems were risk factors. CONCLUSION: Pandemic-related health, economic and social stress present significant risks to the mental health of young people in LMICs where mental health support is limited, but urgently needed to prevent long-term consequences.","Porter, Catherine; Favara, Marta; Hittmeyer, Annina; Scott, Douglas; Sánchez Jiménez, Alan; Ellanki, Revathi; Woldehanna, Tassew; Duc, Le Thuc; Craske, Michelle G; Stein, Alan",BMJ Open,,571

Hospitalized patients (n = 34) with confirmed COVID-19 were recruited into a prospective cohort study. Clinical data and blood samples were collected at inclusion and after 2-5 and 7-10 days. RF was defined as PaO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F) < 40 kPa. Plasma cytokines were analyzed by a Human Cytokine 27-plex assay. COVID-19 patients with RF and/or treated in ICU showed overall increased systemic cytokine levels. Plasma IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF, MCP-1, MIP-1&#945; levels were negatively correlated with P/F, whereas combinations of IL-6, IP-10, IL-1ra and MCP-1 showed the best association with RF in ROC analysis (AUC 0.79-0.80, p < 0.05). During hospitalization the decline was most significant for IP-10 (p < 0.001). Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were present in patients with severe COVID-19.

One is a proposed remnant discovered in 2008 through 1420 MHz polarization maps near Galactic coordinates $l$ = 353, $b$ = $-$34. GALEX far UV (FUV) and H$\alpha$ emission mosaics show the object's radio emission coincident with a 11 x 14 degree shell of UV filaments surrounding a diffuse H$\alpha$ emission ring. Another proposed high latitude SNR is the 20 x 26 degree Antlia nebula (G275.5+18.4) discovered in 2002 through low-resolution all-sky H$\alpha$ and ROSAT soft X-ray emissions. GALEX UV and H$\alpha$ mosaics along with optical spectra indicate the presence of shocks throughout the Antlia nebula with estimated shock velocities of 70 to over 100 km s$^{-1}$. We also present evidence that it has collided with the northeast rim of the Gum Nebula. We find both of these nebulae are bona fide SNRs with ages less than 10$^{5}$ yr despite their unusually large angular dimensions. Using FUV and optical spectra and images, we also report finding an apparent new, high latitude SNR (G249.7+24.7) 4.5 degrees in diameter based on its UV and optical emission properties.

416454,Analysis of the Influence of the Psychology Changes of Fear Induced by the COVID-19 Epidemic on the Body,2020,"BACKGROUND: It is essential to avoid admission of patients with undetected corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to hospitals' general wards. Even repeated negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results do not rule-out COVID-19 with certainty. The study aimed to evaluate a rule-out strategy for COVID-19 using chest computed tomography (CT) in adults being admitted to the emergency department and suspected of COVID-19. METHODS: In this prospective, single centre, diagnostic accuracy cohort study, consecutive adults (&#8805; 18 years) presenting with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 or previous contact to infected individuals, admitted to the emergency department and supposed to be referred to general ward were included in March and April 2020. All participants underwent low-dose chest CT. RT-PCR- and specific antibody tests were used as reference standard. Main outcome measures were sensitivity and specificity of chest CT. Predictive values were calculated based on the theorem of Bayes using Fagan's nomogram. RESULTS: Of 165 participants (56.4% male, 71 ± 16 years) included in the study, the diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed with RT-PCR and AB tests in 13 participants (prevalence 7.9%). Sensitivity and specificity of chest CT were 84.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54.6-98.1) and 94.7% (95% CI, 89.9-97.7), respectively. Positive and negative likelihood ratio of chest CT were 16.1 (95% CI, 7.9-32.8) and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.05-0.58) and positive and negative predictive value were 57.9% (95% CI, 40.3-73.7) and 98.6% (95% CI, 95.3-99.6), respectively.

It has been shown contribution of Dcu transporters in the N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) sensitive proton and potassium transport through the cytoplasmic membrane and membrane-associated ATPase activity. Total H± efflux was decreased ~ 40% while K± uptake was absent in dcuD mutant. DCCD-sensitive H± flux was absent in dcuD nevertheless it was increased ~ 3 fold in dcuACB. K± uptake in dcuACB was stimulated ~ 30% compared to wild type but in DCCD assays K± ions were effluxed with the rate of 0.15 mmol/min per 109 cells/ml. In dcuACB mutant membrane potential (&#916;&#936;) was ~ 30 mV higher than in wild type. dcuD gene expression was increased in the dcuACB mutant respect to wild type at pH 7.5 (~120%), suggesting that an increment of DcuD activity compensates the lack of DcuA, DcuC and DcuB carriers. It can be concluded that active DcuD is important for H± efflux via the FOF1-ATPase and K± uptake at pH 7.5. In addition, DcuA, DcuB and DcuC transporters are crucial for regulating DCCD-sensitive K± transport and &#916;&#936; in E. coli.","Karapetyan, L; Mikoyan, G; Vassilian, A; Valle, A; Bolivar, J; Trchounian, A; Trchounian, K",Bioelectrochemistry,,571

Thus, the development of chemical probes to selectively target each kinase is of great interest. Inhibition of protein kinases with ATP-competitive inhibitors has historically been the most widely used method. However, due to the highly conserved structures of ATP-sites, the identification of truly selective chemical probes is challenging. In this review, we use the Ser/Thr kinase CK2 as an example to highlight the historical challenges in effective and selective chemical probe development, alongside recent advances in the field and alternative strategies aiming to overcome these problems. The methods utilised for CK2 can be applied to an array of protein kinases to aid in the discovery of chemical probes to further understand each kinase's biology, with wide-reaching implications for drug development.","Atkinson, Eleanor L; Iegre, Jessica; Brear, Paul D; Zhabina, Elizabeth A; Hyvönen, Marko; Spring, David R",Molecules (Basel),,571

Therefore, this study tried to understand their levels of motivation and perceptions of online learning. The study also tried to find out the gender difference and the motivational level among the participants. Participants were sent two questionnaires through the Google form, and their responses were analyzed accordingly. The study revealed that Omani students were motivated to exchange learning and teaching materials through online platforms, and the female ones showed slightly more interest in online classes. In addition, the students showed positive perceptions toward and willingness to continue using online platforms for the learning process. Since they are the first group of students with online learning experiences, the study can motivate the teachers to focus on more digital contexts of their study, help them to focus on the design and preparation of materials for the digital community, and curriculum developers can introduce more practical learning and teaching techniques suitable for online education. © 2021, University of Wollongong.

The chemistry of iron, including its oxidation states, is important for its biological functions, its reactivity, and the biology of ferritin. Ferritin can be localized in different cellular compartments and secreted by cells with a variety of functions depending on its spatial context. Here, we discuss how cellular ferritin localization is tightly linked to its function in a tissue-specific manner, and how impairment of iron homeostasis is implicated in diseases, including cancer and coronavirus disease 2019.

METHODS: We distributed a questionnaire online and in hard copy between May 1 and June 18, 2020, via social media, post and face-to-face contact in Leicester, a multi-ethnic city in the UK. RESULTS: From 980 adults providing consent, 665 completed some or all survey items and provided ethnicity data. More than double the proportion of Black and South Asian individuals reported religious practices relating to death, burials or funerals being affected by COVID-19 than White groups. Of the 151 participants reporting practices being impacted, a greater proportion of ethnic minority groups reported restricted access/alteration to eight death-related practices (e.g., funeral attendance) compared with White groups (significantly different for all practices, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK has negatively impacted on the ability to conduct religious practices after death in all ethnic groups, but the impact appears greater in ethnic minority populations than in White groups.

Globalization, a major force behind global wellbeing and equality, is highly associated with this factor. The analysis investigates the impact globalization has on the speed of initial transmission to a country and on the scale of initial infections in the context of other driving factors. Our cross-country analysis finds that measures of globalization are positively related to the spread of the virus, both in speed and scale. However, the study also finds that globalized countries are better equipped to keep fatality rates low. The conclusion is not to reduce globalization to avoid pandemics, but to better monitor the human factor at the outbreak and mobilize collaboration forces to curtail diseases.","Zimmermann, Klaus F; Karabulut, Gokhan; Huseyin Bilgin, Mehmet; Cansin Doker, Asli",World econ,,571

Foram utilizados 288 juvenis com peso médio de 12,78 ± 2,78 g distribuídos aleatoriamente em 24 aquários com volume útil de 500 litros em um sistema de recirculação de água. Durante o período experimental de 45 dias, os peixes foram alimentados quatro vezes ao dia até a saciedade aparente com oito dietas isoproteicas e isocalóricas, constituídas por 0; 33; 67 e 100% de substituição do milho pelo triguilho suplementadas com fitase (0 e 1.500 FTU/kg-1). O delineamento experimental foi inteiramente casualizado em esquema fatorial 4x2 (níveis de suplementação de triguilho x fitase) com oito tratamentos e três repetições, totalizando 24 unidades experimentais. Foram avaliados o desempenho zootécnico, composição química da carcaça, composição mineral óssea e histologia intestinal. Os dados obtidos foram submetidos à análise de variância fatorial (P<0,05) e quando significativas, as médias foram submetidas ao teste de Tukey. Para o desempenho zootécnico, houve influência do alimento no índice de gordura víscero-somática (P<0,05), em que o nível de 100% de substituição apresentou os menores índices. Para a composição química da carcaça, os peixes alimentados com 100 % de triguilho, sem fitase, apresentaram os menores valores de extrato etéreo na carcaça. Na composição mineral óssea, o nível de 100 % de substituição, suplementada com a enzima, apresentou os menores valores de cálcio e manganês.

421944,A Commentary on Realities of Developing COVID-19 Vaccines Discussed through the Global Health Safety Perspective,2021,"The demand outstripping supply of mental health resources during the COVID-19 pandemic presents opportunities for digital technology tools to fill this new gap and, in the process, demonstrate capabilities to increase their effectiveness and efficiency. However, technology-enabled services have faced challenges in being sustainably implemented despite showing promising outcomes in efficacy trials since the early 2000s. The ongoing failure of these implementations has been addressed in reconceptualized models and frameworks, along with various efforts to branch out among disparate developers and clinical researchers to provide them with a key for furthering evaluative research. However, the limitations of traditional research methods in dealing with the complexities of mental health care warrant a diversified approach. The crux of the challenges of digital mental health implementation is the efficacy and evaluation of existing studies. Web-based interventions are increasingly used during the pandemic, allowing for affordable access to psychological therapies. However, a lagging infrastructure and skill base has limited the application of digital solutions in mental health care. Methodologies need to be converged owing to the rapid development of digital technologies that have outpaced the evaluation of rigorous digital mental health interventions and strategies to prevent mental illness. The functions and implications of human-computer interaction require a better understanding to overcome engagement barriers, especially with predictive technologies. Explainable artificial intelligence is being incorporated into digital mental health implementation to obtain positive and responsible outcomes. Investment in digital platforms and associated apps for real-time screening, tracking, and treatment offer the promise of cost-effectiveness in vulnerable populations. Although machine learning has been limited by study conduct and reporting methods, the increasing use of unstructured data has strengthened its potential. Early evidence suggests that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages of incrementing such technology. The limitations of an evidence-based approach require better integration of decision support tools to guide policymakers with digital mental health implementation. There is a complex range of issues with effectiveness, equity, access, and ethics (eg, privacy, confidentiality, fairness, transparency, reproducibility, and accountability), which warrant resolution. Evidence-informed policies, development of eminent digital products and services, and skills to use and maintain these solutions are required. Studies need to focus on developing digital platforms with explainable artificial intelligence-based apps to enhance resilience and guide the treatment decisions of mental health practitioners. Investments in digital mental health should ensure their safety and workability.

China’s rhetoric, however, has not matched its actions in comprehensively providing global public goods and developing universally accepted values. As neither the US and China have taken the global leadership that most countries can trust and count on, the world is in the danger of moving toward the vicious power rivalry, hampering the multilateral responses to global crisis such as COVID-19.","Zhao, Suisheng",J.

During this period, we have witnessed a colossal loss of life, property, business, and a degradation of social life. Several different variants or strains of SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, have been found in different parts of the world. This pandemic has so far infected more than one hundred and thirty five million people, which has caused significant damage to the education sector. The majority of students around the world have lost access to face-to-face classes. While dealing with the crisis, some higher education institutions are still finding it difficult to adapt to alternative ways of imparting education. Many of them are using learning management systems and other online technologies and tools to facilitate online learning. The aim of this manuscript is to propose a cost-effective hybrid teaching model (CeHTM) for the King Abdulaziz University. The proposed model is designed after analyzing two anonymous online feedback surveys in which nearly four thousand students and more than four hundred instructors have participated. The CeHTM is novel as it is the first framework of its kind for imparting education during pandemic. Given the uniformity of educational system in Saudi Arabian universities, the proposed model can be used by other Saudi Arabian institutions, and adapted elsewhere, especially in the Middle East and North Africa.","Bardesi, Hisham; Al-Mashaikhi, Abid; Basahel, Abdullah; Yamin, Mohammad",Int J Inf Technol,,571

Reports from healthcare institutions in different countries show a variety of crisis exit strategies. METHODS: The following is a review and update of the situation and crisis management in Zürich and Switzerland with a special focus on the impact on the cardiac surgery program and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)-therapy in COVID-19. RESULTS: Regional and national measures had avoided the collapse of the health system in Switzerland. There was a reduction of over 50% of the surgical and transcatheter caseload during the first wave of the pandemic. Twenty-three ECMO devices, 150 oxygenators, and more than 300 different cannulas were at our disposal. Between March and May 2020, nine COVID-19 patients were treated by us with ECMO-therapy. Three patients were transported by us from distant institutions. Median age at ECMO implantation was 59 years. Two patients died on support. CONCLUSIONS: Measures to prevent a collapse of the healthcare system were effective. Our local ECMO-Program on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be a useful tool to control mortality and organ failure in critically ill patients.","Sromicki, Juri; Schmiady, Martin; Maisano, Francesco; Mestres, Carlos A",J. card. surg,,571

METHODS: This study analyzed transplant outcomes during the pre-pandemic [PPE, 1/2019-2/2020] and pandemic era [PE, 3/2020-8/2020] based on changes in induction immunosuppression. During PPE, high immunological risk patients received 4-6 mg/kg, moderate risk 2-4 mg/kg, and low risk 1-2 mg/kg of ATG. During PE, ATG doses were reduced to 3-4 mg/kg for high risk, 1-2 mg/kg for moderate, and low changed to basiliximab. Primary outcomes are as follows: biopsy-proven rejection [BPAR], de-novo donor-specific antibody [DSA], delayed graft function [DGF], infection rates, graft loss, and all-cause of mortality. RESULTS: During PPE, 224 kidney transplants [KTx] and 14 kidney/pancreas transplants [KP] were included, while 180 KTx and 5 KP were included for PE. Basiliximab use increased by 30% in the PE. The odds of DGF were statistically significant between PE vs PPE, OR 1.7 [1.05, 2.8, p-value = .042]. The odds of developing DSAs and BPAR during the PE vs. PPE were 0.34 [0.16, 0.71, p-value = .004] and OR 0.34 (0.1 to 1.1, p-value, .104)], respectively. Cytomegalovirus [19% in PE, 37% in PPE] and BK virus [5.4% PE vs. 16% PPE] incidence reduced during PE vs. PPE. COVID-19, graft loss, and mortality were comparable between groups. CONCLUSION: KTx and KP transplants were performed safely during the COVID-19 pandemic with a reduction of induction immunosuppression.","Von Stein, Lauren; Witkowsky, Olya; Samidurai, Lakshmi; Doraiswamy, MohanKumar; Flores, Karen; Pesavento, Todd E; Singh, Priyamvada",Clin Transplant,,571

In addition, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in felids, mink, and dogs in the field. Here, we describe an in-depth investigation using whole-genome sequencing of outbreaks on 16 mink farms and the humans living or working on these farms. We conclude that the virus was initially introduced by humans and has since evolved, most likely reflecting widespread circulation among mink in the beginning of the infection period, several weeks before detection. Despite enhanced biosecurity, early warning surveillance, and immediate culling of animals in affected farms, transmission occurred between mink farms in three large transmission clusters with unknown modes of transmission. Of the tested mink farm residents, employees, and/or individuals with whom they had been in contact, 68% had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Individuals for which whole genomes were available were shown to have been infected with strains with an animal sequence signature, providing evidence of animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within mink farms.","Oude Munnink, Bas B; Sikkema, Reina S; Nieuwenhuijse, David F; Molenaar, Robert Jan; Munger, Emmanuelle; Molenkamp, Richard; van der Spek, Arco; Tolsma, Paulien; Rietveld, Ariene; Brouwer, Miranda; Bouwmeester-Vincken, Noortje; Harders, Frank; Hakze-van der Honing, Renate; Wegdam-Blans, Marjolein C A; Bouwstra, Ruth J; GeurtsvanKessel, Corine; van der Eijk, Annemiek A; Velkers, Francisca C; Smit, Lidwien A M; Stegeman, Arjan; van der Poel, Wim H M; Koopmans, Marion P G",Science,,571
423463,Diagnostic tests for COVID-19: the importance of the before and the after,2020,"The current pandemic (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global health challenge with active development of antiviral drugs and vaccines seeking to reduce its significant disease burden. Early reports have confirmed that transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are critical targets of SARS-CoV-2 that facilitate viral entry into host cells. TMPRSS2 and ACE2 are expressed in multiple human tissues beyond the lung including the testes where predisposition to SARS-CoV-2 infection may exist. TMPRSS2 is an androgen-responsive gene and its fusion represents one of the most frequent alterations in prostate cancer. Androgen suppression by androgen deprivation therapy and androgen receptor signaling inhibitors form the foundation of prostate cancer treatment. In this review, we highlight the growing evidence in support of androgen regulation of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 and the potential clinical implications of using androgen suppression to downregulate TMPRSS2 to target SARS-CoV-2. We also discuss the future directions and controversies that need to be addressed in order to establish the viability of targeting TMPRSS2 and/or ACE2 through androgen signaling regulation for COVID-19 treatment, particularly its relevance in the context of prostate cancer management.","Bhowmick, Neil A; Oft, Jillian; Dorff, Tanya; Pal, Sumanta; Agarwal, Neeraj; Figlin, Robert A; Posadas, Edwin M; Freedland, Stephen J; Gong, Jun",Endocr Relat Cancer,,571

423818,Covid-19-associated cardiac damage in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Case reports and review of the literature,2020,"The coronaviruses are a deadly family of epidemic viruses that can spread from one individual to another very quickly, infecting masses. The literature on epidemics indicates that the early diagnosis of a coronavirus infection can lead to a reduction in mortality rates. To prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from spreading, the regular identification and monitoring of infected patients are needed. In this regard, wireless body area networks (WBANs) can be used in conjunction with machine learning and the Internet of Things (IoT) to identify and monitor the human body for health-related information, which in turn can aid in the early diagnosis of diseases. This paper proposes a novel coronavirus-body area network (CoV-BAN) model based on IoT technology as a real-time health monitoring system for the detection of the early stages of coronavirus infection using a number of wearable biosensors to examine the health status of the patient. The proposed CoV-BAN model is tested with five machine learning-based classification methods, including random forest, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, support vector machine and multi-layer perceptron classifiers, to optimize the accuracy of the diagnosis of COVID-19. For the long-term sustainability of the sensor devices, the development of energy-efficient WBAN is critical. To address this issue, a long-range (LoRa)-based IoT program is used to receive biosensor signals from the patient and transmit them to the cloud directly for monitoring. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model using the random forest classifier outperforms models using the other classifiers, with an average accuracy of 88.6%. In addition, power consumption is reduced when LoRa technology is used as a relay node.","Bilandi, Naveen; Verma, Harsh K; Dhir, Renu",Arab J Sci Eng,,571

METHODS: In this monocentric, retrospective study, clinical and biochemical data of 89 adult patients with COVID-19 was analyzed. These patients were in the care of the Faculty Hospital Pilsen between March 14 and April 7. RESULTS: In this cohort, made up of 89 patients, 63 were treated as outpatients and 26 were hospitalized. 10 patients required intensive care. The most common symptoms among patients were cough and fever. Dyspnea was present in 29 patients. A CT scan showed bilateral pneumonia in 23 of the admitted patients. Fever and bilateral pneumonia were significantly more common in patients &#8805; 60 years old (p=0.047, and p=0.001, respectively). Of lab results, the patients in intensive care had significantly higher values of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin 6, myoglobin and ferritin. CONCLUSION: The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever and cough. These two symptoms are simultaneously present in more than half the cases. Approximately 1/10th of patients requires intensive care. Higher values of lactate dehydrogenase, myoglobin and ferritin on patient admission appear to be a strong predictive factor of the patient's status progressing into requiring ICU attention.","Sín, Robin; Kubiska, Miroslav; Cmorej, Patrik Christian; Váchalová, Jana",Neuro Endocrinol Lett,,571

Currently, there is still a lack of a full understanding of the factors determining the COVID-19 diffusion that clarify the causes of the variability of infections across different provinces and regions within countries. The main goal of this study is to explain new and main determinants underlying the diffusion of COVID-19 in society. This study focuses on international trade because this factor, in a globalized world, can synthetize different drivers of virus spread, such as mobility patterns, economic potentialities, and social interactions of an investigated areas. A case study research is performed on 107 provinces of Italy, one of the first countries to experience a rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths. Statistical analyses from March 2020 to February 2021 suggest that total import and export of provinces has a high association with confirmed cases over time (average r > 0.78, p-value <.001). Overall, then, this study suggests total import and export as complex indicator of COVID-19 transmission dynamics that outclasses other common parameters used to justify the COVID-19 spread, given by economic, demographic, environmental, and climate factors. In addition, this study proposes, for the first time, a time-dependent correlation analysis between trade data and COVID-19 infection cases to explain the relation between confirmed cases and social interactions that are a main source of the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent negative impact in society. These novel findings have main theoretical and practical implications directed to include a new parameter in modelling of the diffusion of COVID-19 pandemic to support effective policy responses of crisis management directed to constrain the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and similar infectious diseases in society.","Bontempi, E; Coccia, M",Environ Res,,571
424664,"India, Kerala and Covid-19",2021,"Exercise behavior is under partial genetic control, but it is also affected by numerous environmental factors, potentially including early-life experiences whose effects persist into adulthood. We studied genetic and early-life environmental effects on wheel-running behavior in a mouse model that includes four replicate high runner (HR) lines selectively bred for increased voluntary wheel running as young adults and four non-selected control (C) lines. In a full factorial design, mice from each line were granted wheel access or not and administered either standard or Western diet (WD) from weaning (3 weeks old) to 6 weeks of age (sexual maturity). In addition to acute effects, after a washout period of 8 weeks (â¼6 human years) in which all mice had standard diet and no wheel access, we found both beneficial and detrimental effects of these early-life exposures. During the first week of treatments, WD increased distance run by 29% in C mice and 48% in HR mice (significant Dietâ¯×â¯Linetype interaction), but diet effects disappeared by the third week. Across the three weeks of juvenile treatment, WD significantly increased fat mass (with lean mass as a covariate). Tested as adults, early-life exercise increased wheel running of C mice but not HR mice in the first week. Early-life exercise also reduced adult anxiety-like behavior and increased adult fasted blood glucose levels, triceps surae mass, subdermal fat pad mass, and brain mass, but decreased heart ventricle mass. Using fat mass as a covariate, early-life exercise treatment increased adult leptin concentration. In contrast, early-life WD increased adult wheel running of HR mice but not C mice. Early-life WD also increased adult lean mass and adult preference for Western diet in all groups. Surprisingly, early-life treatment had no significant effect on adult body fat or maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max). No previous study has tested for combined or interactive effects of early-life WD and exercise. Our results demonstrate that both factors can have long-lasting effects on adult voluntary exercise and related phenotypes, and that these effects are modulated by genetic background. Overall, the long-lasting effects of early-life exercise were more pervasive than those of WD, suggesting critical opportunities for health intervention in childhood habits, as well as possible threats from modern challenges. These results may be relevant for understanding potential effects of activity reductions and dietary changes associated with the obesity epidemic and COVID-19 pandemic.","Cadney, Marcell D; Hiramatsu, Layla; Thompson, Zoe; Zhao, Meng; Kay, Jarren C; Singleton, Jennifer M; Albuquerque, Ralph Lacerda de; Schmill, Margaret P; Saltzman, Wendy; Garland, Theodore",Physiol Behav,,571

The role of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) in the event of COVID-19-associated cardiovascular collapse has not yet been established. We reviewed existing literature surrounding the role of VA-ECMO in the treatment of coronavirus-related cardiovascular collapse. COVID-19 is associated with higher incidence of cardiovascular complications compared to previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV). We found only one case report from China where COVID-19-associated fulminant myocarditis and cardiogenic shock (CS) was successfully rescued using VA-ECMO as a bridge to recovery (BTR). We identified potential clinical scenarios (cardiac injury, myocardial infarction with and without obstructive coronary artery disease, viral myocarditis, and decompensated heart failure) leading to CS and risk factors for poor/uncertain benefit (age, sepsis, mixed/predominantly vasodilatory shock, prothrombotic state and/or coagulopathy, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure or high-risk prognostic scores) specific to using VA-ECMO as BTR in COVID-19 infection. Additional considerations and proposed recommendations specific to the COVID-19 pandemic were formulated with guidance from published data and expert consensus. A small subset of patients with cardiovascular complications from COVID-19 infection may progress to refractory CS. Accepting that resource scarcity may be the overwhelming concern for healthcare systems during this pandemic, VA-ECMO can be considered in highly selected cases of refractory CS and echocardiographic evidence of biventricular failure. The decision to initiate this therapy should take into consideration availability of resources, perceived benefit as well as risks of transmitting disease.","Chow, Justin; Alhussaini, Anhar; Calvillo-Argüelles, Oscar; Billia, Filio; Luk, Adriana",,,571

However, that may be susceptible to errors, and there is a risk of obtaining false results, which ultimately compromises the strategy of efficient disease management. Several modern techniques exhibiting assured results with enhanced sensitivity and specificity against the SARS-CoV-2 associated viral components or immune response against it have been developed and may be implemented. The review deals with the conventional RT-PCR detection techniques and compares them to other detection platforms viz., biosensor based detection of antigens, fluorescent or colorimetric detection systems including CRISPR-Cas 13 based SHERLOCK kit, CRISPR Cas-9 based FELUDA test kit, CRISPR DETECTR kit, Next Generation Sequencing or microarray-based kits. These modern techniques are great as a point of care detection methods but should be followed by RT PCR based detection for the confirmation of COVID-19 status.","Das Mukhopadhyay, Chitrangada; Sharma, Pramita; Sinha, Koel; Rajarshi, Keshav",Biophys Chem,,571

Objective: To describe the mucocutaneous findings seen in children with MIS-C during the height of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in New York City in 2020. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective case series was conducted of 35 children admitted to 2 hospitals in New York City between April 1 and July 14, 2020, who met Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and/or epidemiologic criteria for MIS-C. Main Outcomes and Measures: Laboratory and clinical characteristics, with emphasis on mucocutaneous findings, of children who met criteria for MIS-C. The characterization of mucocutaneous features was verified by 2 board-certified pediatric dermatologists. Results: Twenty-five children (11 girls [44%]; median age, 3 years [range, 0.7-17 years]) were identified who met definitional criteria for MIS-C; an additional 10 children (5 girls [50%]; median age, 1.7 years [range, 0.2-15 years]) were included as probable MIS-C cases (patients met all criteria with the exception of laboratory test evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infection or known exposure). The results of polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-CoV-2 were positive for 10 patients (29%), and the results of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G tests were positive for 19 patients (54%). Of the 35 patients, 29 (83%) exhibited mucocutaneous changes, with conjunctival injection (n = 21), palmoplantar erythema (n = 18), lip hyperemia (n = 17), periorbital erythema and edema (n = 7), strawberry tongue (n = 8), and malar erythema (n = 6) being the most common findings. Recognition of mucocutaneous findings occurred a mean of 2.7 days (range, 1-7 days) after the onset of fever. The duration of mucocutaneous findings varied from hours to days (median duration, 5 days [range, 0-11 days]). Neither the presence nor absence of mucocutaneous findings was significantly associated with overall disease severity. Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series of hospitalized children with suspected MIS-C during the COVID-19 pandemic, a wide spectrum of mucocutaneous findings was identified. Despite their protean and transient nature, these mucocutaneous features serve as important clues in the recognition of MIS-C.","Young, Trevor K; Shaw, Katharina S; Shah, Jinal K; Noor, Asif; Alperin, Risa A; Ratner, Adam J; Orlow, Seth J; Betensky, Rebecca A; Shust, Gail F; Kahn, Philip J; Oza, Vikash S","JAMA dermatol.

A self-reported questionnaire was provided to ascertain the frequency of various lifestyle activities before and after the Covid-19 measure in Japan. Among 463 patients, change in HbA1c was significantly associated with change in body weight. After stratification by age 65, binary logistic regression analysis revealed that increased frequency of snack eating increased body weight (odds ratio [OR]: 1.709, P=0.007) and HbA1c (OR: 1.420, P=0.025) in the younger group, while in the older patients, reduced walking activities resulted in weight gain (OR: 0.726, P=0.010). In conclusion, changes in eating behavior and physical activity increased body weight and reduced glycemic control among DM patients, but by different processes depending on age under the COVID-19 measure in Japan.","Tanaka, Nagaaki; Hamamoto, Yoshiyuki; Kurotobi, Yuri; Yamasaki, Yuji; Nakatani, Susumu; Matsubara, Miho; Haraguchi, Takuya; Yamaguchi, Yuko; Izumi, Kiyohiro; Fujita, Yuki; Kuwata, Hitoshi; Hyo, Takanori; Yamada, Yuichiro; Kurose, Takeshi; Seino, Yutaka",J. diabetes investig.

The purpose of this study was to conduct a 6-month follow-up on the experiences of caregiver burden and psychological distress among caregivers of children with autism (ASD) and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) during COVID-19 pandemic, compare their experiences to caregivers of children without DD, and test the interaction between opportunities for self-care and caregiver burden and psychological distress. Results indicated caregivers of children with ASD/ADHD continued to report significantly higher levels of psychological distress and caregiver burden compared to caregivers of children without DD. Counter to study hypotheses decreased opportunities to engage in self-care as a result of the pandemic predicted higher levels of psychological distress and caregiver burden for caregivers of children without DD, whereas only caregiver burden was moderated by self-care for caregivers of children with ASD/ADHD. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to negatively impact the psychological health of family caregivers of school-age children. In general, greater challenges are presented for caregivers of children with ASD/ADHD, but they seem to be more resilient to some COVID-19 challenges than caregivers of children without DD.","Iovino, Emily A; Caemmerer, Jacqueline; Chafouleas, Sandra M",Res Dev Disabil,,571

METHODS: Only confirmed COVID-19 cases who are Vietnamese and locally infected with available data on date of symptom onset and clearly defined window of possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure were included. We used three parametric forms with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method for Bayesian Inference to estimate incubation period for Vietnamese COVID-19 cases. Leave-one-out Information Criterion was used to assess the performance of three models. RESULTS: A total of 19 cases identified from 23 Jan 2020 to 13 April 2020 was included in our analysis. Average incubation periods estimated using different distribution model ranged from 6.0 days to 6.4 days with the Weibull distribution demonstrated the best fit to the data. The estimated mean of incubation period using Weibull distribution model was 6.4 days (95% credible interval (CrI): 4.89-8.5), standard deviation (SD) was 3.05 (95%CrI 3.05-5.30), median was 5.6, ranges from 1.35 to 13.04 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentiles). Extreme estimation of incubation periods is within 14 days from possible infection. CONCLUSION: This analysis provides evidence for an average incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 6.4 days. Our findings support existing guidelines for 14 days of quarantine of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Although for extreme cases, the quarantine period should be extended up to three weeks.","Bui, Long V; Nguyen, Ha T; Levine, Hagai; Nguyen, Ha N; Nguyen, Thu-Anh; Nguyen, Thuy P; Nguyen, Truong T; Do, Toan T T; Pham, Ngoc T; Bui, My Hanh",PLoS One,,571

AIM: To examine the importance of video visits for the treatment of male sexual medicine at our academic center during the period of peak telemedicine use in April 2020. METHODS: We collected and compared deidentified data from all nonprocedure, adult outpatient encounters conducted as either office visits in April 2019 (n = 1,949) or video visits in April 2020 (n = 608). The primary International Classification of Diseases codes (ICD-10) labeled as diagnoses from all encounters were collected, with most encounters linked to several disease codes (n = 4,584). Demographic data were also collected. We performed comparative analyses on Stata (College Station, TX, USA) with significance set at &#945; = .05. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease codes were categorized based on their use and classification in urological care and the proportion that each category made up within the outpatient practice was calculated. RESULTS: In comparison to the office visits, which took place in April 2019, male sexual medicine visits in April 2020, during the peak of telemedicine use, made up a significantly larger overall share of our practice (P = .012), defined by relative rises in encounters pertaining to male hypogonadism, infertility, penile abnormalities, and testicular abnormalities. Outpatients seen over video visits were also younger than outpatients seen during the previous year over office visits (58.9 vs 60.8, P = .008). Further, race and ethnicity characteristics in the outpatient population were unaffected during the period of telemedicine use. CONCLUSIONS: During the period of historically high telemedicine use following the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, encounters associated with male sexual medicine made up a significantly larger portion of our outpatient practice. Although the full influence of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be delineated, our findings suggest telemedicine use is compatible with the field of sexual medicine.

Methods: The study is a retrospective, institutional cohort, interventional study. It was carried out at our Regional Institute of Ophthalmology from September 2020 to mid-March 2021. All patients of biopsy-proven mucormycosis were enrolled in the study. The patients were subjected to complete history taking, ophthalmological examination, and imaging studies. The patients were treated via a multidisciplinary approach with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B and debridement of local necrotic tissue. Exenteration was done when indicated. A minimum 75-day follow-up period was accorded to all study patients. Statistical analysis was done using Chi-square test. A P value &#8804;0.05 was taken as significant. Results: Thirty-one patients were seen, with a mean age of 56.3 years. The major risk factors included uncontrolled diabetes (96.7%) and COVID-19 positivity (61.2%), with concomitant steroid use in 61.2% patients. The most common presentation was diminution of vision (<6/60 in 80.64% patients) and ophthalmoplegia (77.4%). The most common imaging findings were orbital cellulitis (61.29%) and pansinusitis (77.4%). Intravenous liposomal amphotericin B was given to all patients for an average 18.93 days. Exenteration was required in (n = 4) 12.9% of cases. Twenty-eight patients recovered and were alive on follow-up. Mortality was seen in three patients. The presence of cerebral involvement and a HbA1c value of &#8805;8 were found to be significant in the prediction of survival of patients with mucormycosis.

The virus may cause novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in symptomatic individuals. Since December of 2019, there have been over 7,000,000 confirmed cases and over 400,000 confirmed deaths worldwide. In the United States (U.S.), there have been over 2,000,000 confirmed cases and over 110,000 confirmed deaths. COVID-19 case data in the United States has been updated daily at the county level since the first case was reported in January of 2020. There currently lacks a study that showcases the novelty of daily COVID-19 surveillance using space-time cluster detection techniques. In this paper, we utilize a prospective Poisson space-time scan statistic to detect daily clusters of COVID-19 at the county level in the contiguous 48 U.S. and Washington D.C. As the pandemic progresses, we generally find an increase of smaller clusters of remarkably steady relative risk. Daily tracking of significant space-time clusters can facilitate decision-making and public health resource allocation by evaluating and visualizing the size, relative risk, and locations that are identified as COVID-19 hotspots.","Hohl, Alexander; Delmelle, Eric M; Desjardins, Michael R; Lan, Yu",Spat Spatiotemporal Epidemiol,,571

429290,The COVID-19 pand-ECMO-ic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The clinical presentation of COVID-19 in patients admitted to hospital is heterogeneous. We aimed to determine whether clinical phenotypes of patients with COVID-19 can be derived from clinical data, to assess the reproducibility of these phenotypes and correlation with prognosis, and to derive and validate a simplified probabilistic model for phenotype assignment. Phenotype identification was not primarily intended as a predictive tool for mortality. METHODS: In this study, we used data from two cohorts: the COVID-19@Spain cohort, a retrospective cohort including 4035 consecutive adult patients admitted to 127 hospitals in Spain with COVID-19 between Feb 2 and March 17, 2020, and the COVID-19@HULP cohort, including 2226 consecutive adult patients admitted to a teaching hospital in Madrid between Feb 25 and April 19, 2020. The COVID-19@Spain cohort was divided into a derivation cohort, comprising 2667 randomly selected patients, and an internal validation cohort, comprising the remaining 1368 patients. The COVID-19@HULP cohort was used as an external validation cohort. A probabilistic model for phenotype assignment was derived in the derivation cohort using multinomial logistic regression and validated in the internal validation cohort. The model was also applied to the external validation cohort. 30-day mortality and other prognostic variables were assessed in the derived phenotypes and in the phenotypes assigned by the probabilistic model. FINDINGS: Three distinct phenotypes were derived in the derivation cohort (n=2667)-phenotype A (516 [19%] patients), phenotype B (1955 [73%]) and phenotype C (196 [7%])-and reproduced in the internal validation cohort (n=1368)-phenotype A (233 [17%] patients), phenotype B (1019 [74%]), and phenotype C (116 [8%]). Patients with phenotype A were younger, were less frequently male, had mild viral symptoms, and had normal inflammatory parameters. Patients with phenotype B included more patients with obesity, lymphocytopenia, and moderately elevated inflammatory parameters. Patients with phenotype C included older patients with more comorbidities and even higher inflammatory parameters than phenotype B. We developed a simplified probabilistic model (validated in the internal validation cohort) for phenotype assignment, including 16 variables. In the derivation cohort, 30-day mortality rates were 2·5% (95% CI 1·4-4·3) for patients with phenotype A, 30·5% (28·5-32·6) for patients with phenotype B, and 60·7% (53·7-67·2) for patients with phenotype C (log-rank test p<0·0001). The predicted phenotypes in the internal validation cohort and external validation cohort showed similar mortality rates to the assigned phenotypes (internal validation cohort: 5·3% [95% CI 3·4-8·1] for phenotype A, 31·3% [28·5-34·2] for phenotype B, and 59·5% [48·8-69·3] for phenotype C; external validation cohort: 3·7% [2·0-6·4] for phenotype A, 23·7% [21·8-25·7] for phenotype B, and 51·4% [41·9-60·7] for phenotype C). INTERPRETATION: Patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 can be classified into three phenotypes that correlate with mortality. We developed and validated a simplified tool for the probabilistic assignment of patients into phenotypes. These results might help to better classify patients for clinical management, but the pathophysiological mechanisms of the phenotypes must be investigated.

429321,Editorial: Pandemi Penyakit Menular (COVID-19) Hubungan Internasional,2020,"BACKGROUND: This study sought to assess the quality and readability of web-based Arabic health information on COVID-19. METHODS: Three search engines were searched on 13 April 2020 for specific Arabic terms on COVID-19. The first 100 consecutive websites from each engine were analyzed for eligibility, which resulted in a sample of 36 websites. These websites were subjected to quality assessments using the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmarks tool, the DISCERN tool, and Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct (HONcode) certification. The readability of the websites was assessed using an online readability calculator. RESULTS: Among the 36 eligible websites, only one (2.7%) was HONcode certified. No website attained a high score based on the criteria of the DISCERN tool; the mean score of all websites was 31.5 ± 12.55. As regards the JAMA benchmarks results, a mean score of 2.08 ± 1.05 was achieved by the websites; however, only four (11.1%) met all the JAMA criteria. The average grade levels for readability were 7.2 ± 7.5, 3.3 ± 0.6 and 93.5 ± 19.4 for the Flesch Kincaid Grade Level, Simple Measure of Gobbledygook, and Flesch Reading Ease scales, respectively.

429322,Editorial: Pandemi Penyakit Menular (COVID-19) Hubungan Internasional,2020,"The acidic pH of tumors profoundly inhibits effector functions of activated CD8 + T-cells. We hypothesize that this is a physiological process in immune regulation, and that it occurs within lymph nodes (LNs), which are likely acidic because of low convective flow and high glucose metabolism. Here we show by in vivo fluorescence and MR imaging, that LN paracortical zones are profoundly acidic. These acidic niches are absent in athymic Nu/Nu and lymphodepleted mice, implicating T-cells in the acidifying process. T-cell glycolysis is inhibited at the low pH observed in LNs. We show that this is due to acid inhibition of monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), resulting in a negative feedback on glycolytic rate. Importantly, we demonstrate that this acid pH does not hinder initial activation of naïve T-cells by dendritic cells. Thus, we describe an acidic niche within the immune system, and demonstrate its physiological role in regulating T-cell activation.","Wu, Hao; Estrella, Veronica; Beatty, Matthew; Abrahams, Dominique; El-Kenawi, Asmaa; Russell, Shonagh; Ibrahim-Hashim, Arig; Longo, Dario Livio; Reshetnyak, Yana K; Moshnikova, Anna; Andreev, Oleg A; Luddy, Kimberly; Damaghi, Mehdi; Kodumudi, Krithika; Pillai, Smitha R; Enriquez-Navas, Pedro; Pilon-Thomas, Shari; Swietach, Pawel; Gillies, Robert J",Nat Commun,,571

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused psychological distress, both in infected and uninfected individuals. The present study evaluated the validity and factor structure of the COVID-19-Related Psychological Distress Scale (CORPDS) among the general public of the Persian-speaking population. The original version of the CORPDS was translated and back-translated into Persian, followed by a pilot study. A total sample (n = 623) completed an online survey including the CORPDS, Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R), and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS). The Persian CORPDS had very good internal consistency and moderate test-retest reliability after 4 weeks. Maximum likelihood confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to test construct validity (&#967;2/df = 2.39, CFI = 0.95, SRMR = 0.046, PCLOSE = 0.67 > 0.05, RMSEA = 0.047, 90% CI [0.038, 0.056]). Measurement invariance was performed across gender, including configural invariance, metric invariance, scalar invariance, and error variance invariance, and yielded further support for the two-factor structure of the CORPDS. The CORPDS correlated with the score on the K10 (r = 0.46, p < 0.01, 95% CI [0.43, 0.48]), CAS (r = 0.43, p < 0.01, 95% CI [0.37, 0.45]), FCV-19S (r = 0.29, p < 0.01, 95% CI [0.27, 0.32]), LOT-R (r = - 0.19, p < 0.01, 95% CI [- 0.15, - 0.24]) and BRS (r = - 0.56, p < 0.01, 95% CI [- 0.50, - 0.61]). Resilience was associated with lower psychological distress (ß = - 0.54, SE = 0.05, p < 0.001). The findings provide evidence that CORPDS is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing psychological distress generated by COVID-19 among a healthy Persian-speaking population.","Nazari, Nabi; Zekiy, Angelina Olegovna; Feng, Lin-Sen; Griffiths, Mark D",Int J Ment Health Addict,,571
429654,COVID-19 has taught US that foresight and tech are a winning combination,2020,"The epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel Betacoronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became a public health emergency worldwide. Few reports indicate that owned pets from households with at least one human resident that was diagnosed with COVID-19 can be infected by SARS-CoV-2. However, the exposure to SARS-CoV-2 of pets from households with no COVID-19 cases or stray animals remains less assessed. Using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT90), we investigated the infection and previous exposure of dogs and cats to SARS-CoV-2 during the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. From June to August 2020, 96 animals were sampled, including 49 cats (40 owned and 9 stray) and 47 dogs (42 owned and 5 stray). Regarding owned pets, 75.6% (62/82) belonged to households with no COVID-19 cases. Samples included serum, and rectal and oropharyngeal swabs. All swabs were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but serum samples of a stray cat and a stray dog presented neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, with PRNT90 titer of 80 and 40, respectively. Serological data presented here suggest that not only owned pets from households with COVID19 cases, but also stray animals are being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Dias, Helver Gonçalves; Resck, Maria Eduarda Barreto; Caldas, Gabriela Cardoso; Resck, Alessandro Fioretti; da Silva, Natália Valente; Dos Santos, Aline Marcele Vieira; Sousa, Thiago das Chagas; Ogrzewalska, Maria Halina; Siqueira, Marilda Mendonça; Pauvolid-Corrêa, Alex; Dos Santos, Flavia Barreto",PLoS One,,571

We sought to characterize general surgeons’ perceptions of their surgical practice in Ontario, Canada, regarding operating room precautions to maximize safety during the pandemic. METHODS: A web-administered cross-sectional survey was sent to general surgeons registered with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario on May 19, 2020. Surgeons were surveyed regarding their practices in pre-operative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing, use of intra-operative personal protective equipment (PPE) given a patient’s COVID-19 status, and management of common general surgical emergencies with COVID-19 patients. Responses were compared between surgeons from high- and low-prevalence public health units (PHUs) in Ontario using chi-square tests. RESULTS: There were 81 respondents (rate: 81/271, 30%), 48 (59%) of whom were from a PHU in the top quartile of COVID-19 prevalence. Surgeons from low-prevalence PHUs reported pre-procedural COVID-19 testing rates similar to those reported in high-prevalence PHUs for elective (36% versus 55%), urgent (36% versus 54%), and emergent (20% versus 33%) surgeries. Seventy-eight percent of surgeons with COVID-19-negative patients limited trainees in the operating room compared with 96% of surgeons with COVID-19-positive patients. Use of N95 respirators was 17% for surgeons with COVID-19-negative patients, which dramatically increased to 62% for surgeons with patients whose COVID-19 status was unknown. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support a need for improved understanding of local disease prevalence and risk of COVID-19 transmission to conserve PPE and return surgical trainees to pre-pandemic standards.","Griffiths, C.

430654,Infidelity in the Time of COVID-19,2020,"Copper(I) hydride complexes represent a promising entry into formic acid dehydrogenation catalysis. Herein we present the spontaneous decarboxylation of a µ1,3-formate-bridged dicopper(II) complex (1H) to a hexacopper(I) hydride cluster (2H) upon reduction. Isotopic labeling studies revealed that both the H- and CO2 originate from the bound µ1,3-formate in 1H, which represents a key step of the metal-mediated formic acid dehydrogenation. The full reaction equation for the conversion of 1H to 2H is established. The structure of 2H features two Cu3 triangles, each capped by a hydride ligand. Typical hydride reactivity of 2H is demonstrated by the addition of phenylacetylene, leading to the replacement of the hydrides by alkynide ligands -C&#8801;CPh (3) while retaining the hexacopper(I) core. Temperature-dependent dynamic behavior in solution on the NMR time scale was observed for both 2H and 3, reflecting the rich structural landscape of the bis(pyrazolate)-bridged hexacopper(I) core (four isomers each for 2H and 3) predicted by DFT calculations.","Lücken, Jana; Auth, Thomas; Mozzi, Sara Ida; Meyer, Franc",Inorg Chem,,571

OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between low vitamin D status and COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted with PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from database inception to September 25, 2020. The standardized mean difference (SMD) or odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was applied to estimate pooled results. Random - or fixed-effect models based on heterogeneity were used for the meta-analysis. Funnel plots and Egger regression tests were used to assess publication bias. RESULTS: A total of ten articles with 361,934 participants were selected for meta-analysis. Overall, the pooled OR in the fixed-effect model showed that vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.00-2.05). In addition, COVID-19-positive individuals had lower vitamin D levels than COVID-19-negative individuals (SMD = -0.37, 95% CI = -0.52 to -0.21). Significant heterogeneity existed in both endpoints. Funnel plots and Egger regression tests revealed significant publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that low vitamin D status might be associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on the clinical severity and prognosis in patients with COVID-19.

Retirement, widowhood, and increased prevalence of chronic diseases in this age group lead to a decline in social relationships, which in turn has adverse consequences on health and well-being. The coronavirus COVID-19 crisis worsened this situation, raising interest for mobile telepresence robots (MTR) that would help create, maintain, and strengthen social relationships. MTR are tools equipped with a camera, monitor, microphone, and speaker, with a body on wheels that allows for remote-controlled and sometimes autonomous movement aiming to provide easy access to assistance and networking services. We conducted a narrative review of literature describing experimental studies of MTR involving elderly people over the last 20 years, including during the COVID-19 period. The aim of this review was to examine whether MTR use was beneficial for reducing loneliness and social isolation among older adults at home and in health and care institutions and to examine the current benefits and barriers to their use and implementation. We screened 1754 references and included 24 research papers focusing on the usability, acceptability, and effectiveness of MTR. News reports on MTR use during the COVID-19 period were also examined. A qualitative, multidimensional analysis methodology inspired by a health technology assessment model was used to identify facilitating and limiting factors and investigate if and how MTR could reduce social isolation in elderly people. Reviewed studies provide encouraging evidence that MTR have potential in this regard, as experiments report positive feedback on MTR design and core functionalities. However, our analysis also points to specific technical, ergonomic, and ethical challenges that remain to be solved, highlighting the need for further multidimensional research on the design and impact of MTR interventions for older adults and building on new insights gained during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Isabet, Baptiste; Pino, Maribel; Lewis, Manon; Benveniste, Samuel; Rigaud, Anne-Sophie",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,571

432137,"Playgrounds, Injuries, and Data: Keeping Children Safe",2020,"BACKGROUND: Globally, and particularly in countries with rapidly ageing populations like Japan, there are growing concerns over the heavy burden of ill health borne by older people, and the capacity of the health system to ensure their access to quality care. Older people with dementia may face even greater barriers to appropriate care in acute care settings. Yet, studies about the care quality for older patients with dementia in acute care settings are still few. The objective of this study is to assess whether dementia status is associated with poorer treatment by examining the association of a patient's dementia status with the probability of receiving surgery and the waiting time until surgery for a hip fracture in acute care hospitals in Japan. METHODS: All patients with closed hip fracture were extracted from the Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) database between April 2014 and March 2018. After excluding complicated cases, we conducted regressions with multilevel models. We used two outcome measures: (i) whether the patient received a surgery or was treated by watchful waiting; and (ii) number of waiting days until surgery after admission. RESULTS: Two hundred fourteen thousand six hundred one patients discharged from 1328 hospitals were identified. Among them, 159,173 patients received surgery. Both 80-89 year-olds (OR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.84, 0.90) and those 90 years old and above (OR 0.67; 95% CI, 0.65, 0.70) had significantly lower odds ratios for receiving surgery compared to 65-79 year-olds. Those with severe dementia had a significantly greater likelihood of receiving surgery compared to those without dementia (OR 1.21; 95% CI, 1.16, 1.25). Patients aged 90 years old and above had shorter waiting time for surgery (Coef. -0.06; 95% CI, - 0.11, - 0.01). Mild dementia did not have a statistically significant impact on the number of waiting days until surgery (P = 0.34), whereas severe dementia was associated with shorter waiting days (Coef. -0.08; 95% CI, - 0.12, - 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest physicians may be taking proactive measures to preserve physical function for those with severe dementia and to avoid prolonged hospitalization although there are no formal guidelines on prioritization for the aged and dementia patients.","Tomioka, Shinichi; Rosenberg, Megumi; Fushimi, Kiyohide; Matsuda, Shinya",BMC Health Serv Res,,571

We report here the case of a young patient requiring inpatient care due to severe decompensated liver disease (MELD 24), justifying her referral from her local hospital to our high-volume LT unit, despite the unfavourable COVID-19 epidemiology in our Region. She was quickly listed for liver transplant (MELD 26), but 5 days later she was incidentally diagnosed with COVID-19 in the setting of our surveillance program for very sick patients and, despite her underlying condition, had an indolent course of the viral disease. Concerns about potential COVID-19 consequences in a LT candidate were overruled by the severity of liver disease (MELD 36), forcing our team to proceed with an urgent successful LT as soon as 9 days after the COVID-19 diagnosis, 2 days after the first negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA by a nasopharyngeal swab and 1 day after the confirmation of its negativity on bronchoalveolar lavage. The patient was discharged on day 9 after LT. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a LT candidate recovering from a mild form of COVID19 and undergoing a successful LT shortly after. Aggressive care should be maintained in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with decompensated cirrhosis in order to overcome viral infection and to proceed as soon as possible with life-saving treatment.","Martini, Silvia; Patrono, Damiano; Pittaluga, Fabrizia; Brunetto, Maurizia Rossana; Lupo, Francesco; Amoroso, Antonio; Cavallo, Rossana; Balagna, Roberto; Romagnoli, Renato",,,571
432558,Modeling Simulation Of COVID-19 In Indonesia Based On Early Endemic Data,2020,"ObjectivesTo investigate: (1) whether vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 has decreased since Delta became the predominant variant; (2) whether efficacy wanes with time since second dose. DesignMatched case-control study. SettingPopulation of Scotland from 1 December 2020 to 19 August 2021. Main outcome measureSevere COVID-19, defined as cases with entry to critical care or fatal outcome. ResultsEfficacy of vaccination against severe COVID-19 decreased in May 2021 coinciding with the replacement of the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) by the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant in Scotland, but this decrease was reversed over the next month. In the most recent time window, the efficacy of two doses against severe COVID-19 was 91% (95 percent CI 86% to 95%) for the AstraZeneca product and 92% (95 percent CI 85% to 95%) for mRNA (Pfizer or Moderna) products. Against the broader category of hospitalised or fatal COVID-19, efficacy in this time window was slightly lower: 88% (95 percent CI 85% to 90%) for the AstraZeneca product, 91% (95 percent CI 88% to 93%) for mRNA vaccines. Efficacy against COVID-19 declined rapidly in the first two months since second dose but more slowly thereafter. For hospitalised or fatal COVID-19 the model best supported by the data was one in which efficacy was the sum of a rapidly waning effect with half-life of 17 (95% CI 9 to 39) days and a time-invariant efficacy of 83%. ConclusionsThese results are reassuring with respect to concerns that efficacy against severe COVID-19 might have fallen since the Delta variant became predominant. Although there is considerable uncertainty attached to any extrapolation into the future, these results suggest that the rapid early waning of efficacy against hospitalised COVID-19 after the second dose tapers off within a few months. This weakens the rationale for policies based on delivering booster doses to the entire population, rather than to vulnerable individuals for focused protection.","McKeigue, Paul M; McAllister, David; Hutchinson, Sharon J; Robertson, Chris; Stockton, Diane; Colhoun, Helen M",,,571
432584,Local Development Policies: Challenges for Post-COVID-19 Recovering in Spain,2020,"In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, environmental surveillance for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 has become increasingly important. Studies have demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA is present in the feces of infected individuals; further, its presence in wastewater has been reported. However, an optimized method for its detection in sewage has not yet been adequately investigated. Therefore, in this study, the efficient detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the solid fraction of wastewater was investigated using two quantitative PCR assays. In particular, wastewater samples were collected from a manhole located in the commercial district of a metropolitan region in Japan, where COVID-19 is highly prevalent, and two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The samples were concentrated using four separate methods, namely, electronegative membrane adsorption, polyethylene glycol precipitation, ultrafiltration, and solid precipitation. Each method revealed a significant concentration of pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) RNA, which is an indicator virus for wastewater. As expected, non-enveloped PMMoV RNA was enriched in the supernatant fraction such that relatively low concentrations were detected in the solid fraction of the wastewater samples. In contrast, higher SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations were consistently detected in the solid fractions compared with the supernatant fractions based on the other methods that were investigated in this study. Spearman's correlation tests showed that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater samples from the WWTP were significantly correlated with the number of COVID-19 cases recorded during the data collection period. These results demonstrate that viral recovery from the solid fraction is an effective method for SARS-CoV-2 RNA surveillance in an aqueous environment.","Kitamura, Kouichi; Sadamasu, Kenji; Muramatsu, Masamichi; Yoshida, Hiromu",Sci Total Environ,,571

Paper-based toehold reaction, a recently emerged colorimetric POC nucleic acid diagnostic test, has been widely used for pathogen detection and microbiome profiling. Here, we introduce an amplification method called reverse transcription loop-mediated amplification (RT-LAMP) prior to the toehold reaction and modify it to enable more sensitive and faster colorimetric detection of RNA viruses. We show that incorporating the modified RT-LAMP to the toehold reaction detects as few as 120 copies of coronavirus RNA in 70 min. Cross-reactivity test against other coronaviruses indicates this toehold reaction with the modified RT-LAMP is highly specific to the target RNA. Overall, the paper-based toehold switch sensors with the modified RT-LAMP allow fast, sensitive, specific and colorimetric coronavirus detection.","Park, Soan; Lee, Jeong Wook",Int. j. mol. sci.

This paper shares the perspectives of expert clinicians working with OCD considering how to identify OCD in the context of COVID-19, changes in the presentation and importantly what to consider when undertaking Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) for OCD in the current climate. The expert consensus is although the presentation of OCD and treatment may have become more difficult, CBT should still continue remotely unless there are specific reasons for it not to e.g. increase in risk, no access to computer or exposure tasks or behavioural experiments cannot be undertaken. The authors highlight some of the considerations to take in CBT in light of our current understanding of COVID-19, including therapists and clients taking calculated risks when developing behavioural experiments and exposure tasks, considering viral loading and vulnerability factors. Special considerations for young people and perinatal women are discussed as well as foreseeing what life may be like for those with OCD after the pandemic is over.","Jassi, Amita; Shahriyarmolki, Khodayar; Taylor, Tracey; Peile, Lauren; Challacombe, Fiona; Clark, Bruce; Veale, David",Cogn.

Using data from Twitter, YouTube, and an archive of debunked misinformation stories, we found two important patterns. First, that retweet rates on Twitter clearly suggest that commentators benefited from talking about the case, which got higher engagement than other topics. Second, that politicians, in particular, were instrumental in changing the course of the discourse by referring to the case as 'murder', rather than 'suicide'. In conclusion, we consider the effects of Rajput's outsider status as a small-town implant in the film industry within the broader narrative of systemic injustice, as well as the gendered aspects of mob justice that have taken aim at his former partner in the months since.","Akbar, Syeda Zainab; Sharma, Ankur; Negi, Himani; Panda, Anmol; Pal, Joyojeet",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11744v2.pdf,571

In the present study, composite structures of lysozyme amyloid fibrils with zein proteins were fabricated using the antisolvent precipitation method by applying different blending and pH adjustment sequences. Globular prolamins were bound to the amyloid fibrils to combine their respective advantages. The dynamic light scattering showed that the composites with a characteristic stabilized behavior (43.60 ± 1.75 mV ~ 35.20 ± 0.65 mV) were formed at pH 4.0-5.0, in which non-covalent interactions between fibril and particles occurred. Two different structures, fruit tree-like structure and beaded-like structure, were presented in AFM and TEM images due to the different pH adjustment sequences, while blending sequences had negligible effect on the morphology of the composites. A fruit tree-like entity was detected for lysozyme fibrils-zein composites, where its ""branches"" bear zein globular particles. A beaded-like structure was observed for lysozyme fibrils-zein composites, where lysozyme fibril was the thread and zein aggregates were the beads. The potential mechanism of this phenomenon can be explained as the fruit tree-like structure being primarily formed through electrostatic interactions while the beaded-like structure is mainly caused by hydrophobic interactions. The composites of fruit tree-like structures hold a more promising stability than those with beaded-like structures. The results of this research would give constructive information for the fabrication of amyloid fibril-prolamin protein composites, which may exhibit the combined advantages of each components and have potential applications in encapsulation and protection of bioactive substances and stabilizing emulsions.","Song, Jingru; Sun, Cuixia; Xiang, Yanwei; Xie, Yun; Mata, Analucia; Fang, Yapeng",,,571
434208,Off-season RSV epidemics in Australia after easing of COVID-19 restrictions,2021,"OBJECTIVES: A meta-analysis and systematic review was conducted on kidney-related outcomes of three recent pandemics: SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, which were associated with potentially fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: A search of all published studies until 16 June 2020 was performed. The incidence/prevalence and mortality risk of acute and chronic renal events were evaluated, virus prevalence, and mortality in preexisting hemodialysis patients was investigated. RESULTS: A total of 58 eligible studies involving 13452 hospitalized patients with three types of coronavirus infection were included. The reported incidence of new-onset acute kidney injury (AKI) was 12.5% (95% CI: 7.6%-18.3%). AKI significantly increased the mortality risk (OR = 5.75, 95% CI 3.75-8.77, p < 0.00001) in patients with coronavirus infection. The overall rate of urgent-start kidney replacement therapy (urgent-start KRT) use was 8.9% (95% CI: 5.0%-13.8%) and those who received urgent-start KRT had a higher risk of mortality (OR = 3.43, 95% CI 2.02-5.85, p < 0.00001). Patients with known chronic kidney disease (CKD) had a higher mortality than those without CKD (OR = 1.97, 95% CI 1.56-2.49, p < 0.00001). The incidence of coronavirus infection was 7.7% (95% CI: 4.9%-11.1%) in prevalent hemodialysis patients with an overall mortality rate of 26.2% (95% CI: 20.6%-32.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Primary kidney involvement is common with coronavirus infection and is associated with significantly increased mortality. The recognition of AKI, CKD, and urgent-start KRT as major risk factors for mortality in coronavirus-infected patients are important steps in reducing future mortality and long-term morbidity in hospitalized patients with coronavirus infection.","Zhou, Shoulian; Xu, Jing; Xue, Cheng; Yang, Bo; Mao, Zhiguo; Ong, Albert C M",Ren Fail,,571
434258,Resurgence of covid-19 in Japan,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Older subjects have a higher risk of COVID-19 infection and a greater mortality. However, there is a lack of studies evaluating the characteristics of this infection at advanced age. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 404 patients &#8805; 75 years (mean age 85.2â¯±â¯5.3 years, 55 % males), with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection, attended in two hospitals in Madrid (Spain). Patients were followed-up until they were discharged from the hospital or until death. RESULTS: Symptoms started 2-7 days before admission, and consisted of fever (64 %), cough (59 %), and dyspnea (57 %). A total of 145 patients (35.9 %) died a median of 9 days after hospitalization. In logistic regression analysis, predictive factors of death were age (OR 1.086; 1.015-1.161 per year, pâ¯=â¯0.016), heart rate (1.040; 1.018-1.061 per beat, pâ¯<â¯0.0001), a decline in renal function during hospitalization (OR 7.270; 2.586-20.441, pâ¯<â¯0.0001) and worsening dyspnea during hospitalization (OR 73.616; 30.642-176.857, pâ¯<â¯0.0001). Factors predicting survival were a female sex (OR 0.271; 0.128-0.575, pâ¯=â¯0.001), previous treatment with RAAS inhibitors (OR 0.459; 0.222-0.949, pâ¯=â¯0.036), a higher oxygen saturation at admission (OR 0.901; 0.842-0.963 per percentage point increase, pâ¯=â¯0.002), and a greater platelet count (OR 0.995; 0.991-0.999 per 106/L, pâ¯=â¯0.025).

434847,COVID-19 and SCA: an old friend comes to the rescue,2020,"Background: The phase 3—“mitigation”—of the current pandemic by SARS-CoV‑2 is now imminent also in Germany. Given the high complexity many issues have to be taken into account. Simplification is urgently warranted not to loose focus of the important things to be done. Methods: To look at phase 3 from the endpoint—in this case hospital admission—should facilitate the focus on key variables upstream. Based on a simplified model of approximated and plausible parameters for the overall attack rate (AR), the AR(hospitalization) and the AR(ICU admission), the resources needed are compared with the available resources i.e. number of beds available in general and beds in ICU in particular. The calculations are carried out population-based for Ploen County as well as regionally together with the Kiel metropolitan area. Results: Since the ARs in the up do date available cohorts are overestimated, considerably lower AR(hospitalization) and AR(ICU) should be expected. An AR(hospitalization) of 10% could not be materialized in Ploen County; one with 5% could. In the regional analysis together with the University Hospital Kiel (UKSH) an AR(hospitalization) of up to 10% is feasible, as also an AR(ICU) of 3%. The kinetics of hospital admissions is, however, dependent from countermeasures in public health as well as admission habits of the family physicians. The available number of beds is determined by beds made available and by the mean duration of hospitalization. The latter depends from the age and underlying conditions of the patients. Conclusions: System failure has to be averted by clarity in regard to the key parameters and their independent variables. The regional management is crucial and should be coordinated by a so-called bed-coordinator. Close cooperation allover the health care system is needed in alliance with the local health departments.","Weigl, Josef",Pravent. Gesundheitsforderung,,571

Complement was implicated as key contributor to this process, therefore we hypothesized that markers of the complement profile, indicative for the activation state of the system, may be related to the severity and mortality of COVID-19. Methods: In this prospective cohort study samples of 102 hospitalized and 26 outpatients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were analyzed. Primary outcome was in-hospital, COVID-19 related mortality, and secondary outcome was COVID-19 severity as assessed by the WHO ordinal scale. Complement activity of alternative and classical pathways, its factors, regulators, and activation products were measured by hemolytic titration, turbidimetry, or enzyme-immunoassays. Clinical covariates and markers of inflammation were extracted from hospital records. Results: Increased complement activation was characteristic for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Complement activation was significantly associated with markers of inflammation, such as interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and ferritin. Twenty-five patients died during hospital stay due to COVID-19 related illness. Patients with uncontrolled complement activation leading to consumption of C3 and decrease of complement activity were more likely to die, than those who had complement activation without consumption. Cox models identified anaphylatoxin C3a, and C3 overactivation and consumption (ratio of C3a/C3) as predictors of in-hospital mortality [HR of 3.63 (1.55-8.45, 95% CI) and 6.1 (2.1-17.8), respectively]. Conclusion: Increased complement activation is associated with advanced disease severity of COVID-19. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are more likely to die when the disease is accompanied by overactivation and consumption of C3. These results may provide observational evidence and further support to studies on complement inhibitory drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.","Sinkovits, György; Mezo, Blanka; Réti, Marienn; Müller, Veronika; Iványi, Zsolt; Gál, János; Gopcsa, László; Reményi, Péter; Szathmáry, Beáta; Lakatos, Botond; Szlávik, János; Bobek, Ilona; Prohászka, Zita Z; Förhécz, Zsolt; Csuka, Dorottya; Hurler, Lisa; Kajdácsi, Erika; Cervenak, László; Kiszel, Petra; Masszi, Tamás; Vályi-Nagy, István; Prohászka, Zoltán",Front Immunol,,571

In this study, we explored psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms) using an online survey platform in a sample of 1,781 Spanish adults during the confinement due to COVID-19, relationships between distress and sleep problems, affect, pain, sleep, emotional regulation, gender, type of housing, history of psychopathology, and living alone during the confinement, and differences depending on demographic and psychological variables. Results showed that between 25% and 39% of the sample referred to clinically significant levels of distress. In addition, women showed higher levels of distress, negative affect, perception of pain, and cognitive reappraisal and lower levels of emotional suppression and sleep quality than men. A history of psychopathology, being younger, living alone or in a flat was associated with higher distress. Finally, the variables most strongly related to distress were negative and positive affect, levels of pain, sleep quality, and emotional suppression. Our results highlight the important role of emotional suppression, cognitive reappraisal, and loneliness and the impact of being a woman and younger in Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it would be necessary to provide assessments of distress levels in these population groups and focus psychological preventive and therapeutic online interventions on expressing emotions and preventing loneliness.","Pérez, Sandra; Masegoso, Andrea; Hernández-Espeso, Nazaret",,,571

However, little is known about how the pandemic has impacted pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)-using men who have sex with men (MSM). METHODS: Data come from an online cohort of PrEP-using MSM in the Southern United States from October 2019 to July 2020. Participants were administered 10 surveys in total, including 1 ad hoc survey specifically on COVID-19. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of this ad hoc survey (n = 56) and present changes in sexual behaviors and utilization of and access to sexual health services. Using linear mixed-effect regression models, we also analyzed data from the larger cohort and document how sexual behaviors and PrEP use varied longitudinally across several months. RESULTS: A fifth of participants discontinued or changed how often they take PrEP because of COVID-19. A quarter of the cohort documented challenges when attempting to access PrEP, HIV testing, or STD testing. For all sexual behaviors examined longitudinally-number of male sexual partners, anal sex acts, condomless anal sex, and oral sex (all measured in the past 2 weeks)-there was a decrease from February to April followed by an increase from April to June. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest reduced access to and utilization of STD and HIV services coupled with a continuation of behaviors which confer STD/HIV risk. Ensuring appropriate delivery of STD/HIV prevention services during this pandemic is imperative.","Pampati, Sanjana; Emrick, Kayla; Siegler, Aaron J; Jones, Jeb",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,,571

This study aimed to assess the characteristics of kidney injury and its association with disease progression and death of patients with coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This is a retrospective study. Two representative cohorts were included. Cohort 1 involved severe and critical patients with coronavirus disease 2019 from Wuhan, China. Cohort 2 was all patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Shenzhen city (Guangdong province, China). Any kidney injury was defined as the presence of any of the following: hematuria, proteinuria, in-hospital AKI, or prehospital AKI. AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) creatinine criteria. The primary outcome was death at the end of follow-up. The secondary outcome was progression to critical illness during the study period. RESULTS: A total of 555 patients were enrolled; 42% of the cases (229 of 549) were detected with any kidney injury, 33% of the cases (174 of 520) were detected with proteinuria, 22% of the cases (112 of 520) were detected with hematuria, and 6% of the cases (29 of 520) were detected with AKI. Of the 29 patients with AKI, 21 cases were recognized as in-hospital AKI, and eight were recognized as prehospital AKI. Altogether, 27 (5%) patients died at the end of follow-up. The death rate was 11% (20 of 174) in patients with proteinuria, 16% (18 of 112) in patients with hematuria, and 41% (12 of 29) in the AKI settings. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that proteinuria (hazard ratio, 4.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.22 to 15.94), hematuria (hazard ratio, 4.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.61 to 13.81), and in-hospital AKI (hazard ratio, 6.84; 95% confidence interval, 2.42 to 19.31) were associated with death. Among the 520 patients with noncritical illness at admission, proteinuria (hazard ratio, 2.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.22 to 5.56) and hematuria (hazard ratio, 2.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 5.08) were found to be associated with progression to critical illness during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney injury is common in coronavirus disease 2019, and it is associated with poor clinical outcomes.

437489,COVID-19 affects HIV and tuberculosis care,2020,"Research from financial stress, disasters, pandemics, and other extreme events, suggests that behavioral health will suffer, including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Furthermore, these symptoms are likely to exacerbate alcohol or drug use, especially for those vulnerable to relapse. The nature of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and vast reach of the virus, leave many unknows for the repercussions on behavioral health, yet existing research suggests that behavioral health concerns should take a primary role in response to the pandemic. We propose a 4-step services system designed for implementation with a variety of different groups and reserves limited clinical services for the most extreme reactions. While we can expect symptoms to remit overtime, many will also have longer-term or more severe concerns. Behavioral health interventions will likely need to change overtime and different types of interventions should be considered for different target groups, such as for those who recover from COVID-19, health-care professionals, and essential personnel; and the general public either due to loss of loved ones or significant life disruption. The important thing is to have a systematic plan to support behavioral health and to engage citizens in prevention and doing their part in recovery by staying home and protecting others.","Hansel, Tonya Cross; Saltzman, Leia Y; Bordnick, Patrick S",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,571

Methods: We retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging, and laboratory characteristics of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized from January 30, 2020 to March 17, 2020, at the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. A detailed clinical record was kept for each subject, including the medical history of COVID-19 and physical and laboratory examinations. A total of 164 subjects were eligible for the study, among which 40 patients were comorbid with T2D. Further analysis was conducted in two subcohorts of sex- and age-matched patients with and without T2D to identify hematological and biochemical differences. The laboratory tests, including routine blood tests, serum biochemistry, and coagulation function, were performed upon admission. Results: The two groups showed no significant differences in baseline parameters, including age, sex, chest X-ray, or computed tomography (CT) findings, upon admission. However, patients with T2D showed an increased incidence of diarrhea. T2D patients required more recovery time from pneumonia, as shown by follow-up CT findings, which might contribute to the prolonged hospitalization. Comorbidity with T2D also increased risk of secondary bacterial infection during COVID-19. The T2D group had significantly higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts compared with the nondiabetic group, but T2D patients suffered from more severe lymphocytopenia and inflammation (P < 0.05). Most biochemical parameters showed no significant differences between the two groups (P > 0.05). However, patients with T2D seemed to have a significantly higher risk of developing hyperlactatemia, hyponatremia, and hypocalcemia. Conclusions: COVID-19 patients comorbid with T2D demonstrated distinguishing clinical features and hematological parameters during the infection. It is necessary to develop a different clinical severity scoring system for COVID-19 patients with T2D. This study may provide helpful clues for the assessment and management of COVID-19 in T2D patients.","Sun, Yujing; Zhao, Ruxing; Hu, Zhao; Wang, Weili; Wang, Shouyu; Gao, Ling; Fei, Jianchun; Jian, Xiangdong; Li, Yu; Zheng, Huizhen; Hou, Xinguo; Chen, Li",J Diabetes Res,,571
438560,Modelling fatality curves of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of intervention strategies,2020,"Despite the development of new diagnostic methods, co‐culture, based on sample inoc-ulation of cell monolayers coupled with electron microscopy (EM) observation, remains the gold standard in virology. Indeed, co‐culture allows for the study of cell morphology (infected and not infected), the ultrastructure of the inoculated virus, and the different steps of the virus infectious cycle. Most EM methods for studying virus cycles are applied after infected cells are produced in large quantities and detached to obtain a pellet. Here, cell culture was performed in sterilized, collagen‐coated single‐break strip wells. After one day in culture, cells were infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. Wells of interest were fixed at different time points, from 2 to 36 h post‐infection. Microwave‐assisted resin embedding was accomplished directly in the wells in 4 h. Finally, ul-tra‐thin sections were cut directly through the infected‐cell monolayers. Our methodology re-quires, in total, less than four days for preparing and observing cells. Furthermore, by observing undetached infected cell monolayers, we were able to observe new ultrastructural findings, such as cell–cell interactions and baso‐apical cellular organization related to the virus infectious cycle. Our innovative methodology thus not only saves time for preparation but also adds precision and new knowledge about viral infection, as shown here for SARS‐CoV‐2. © 2021 by the authors.

As the United Kingdom (UK) leaves the European Union, an understanding of the migration trends and possible influences are important to inform future planning. AIM: To examine trends in the profile of UK registered dentists in the context of key events and policy changes from 2000 to 2020. METHOD: Data were obtained from the General Dental Council via annual reports, and under 'freedom of information' communications; details of policy initiatives were obtained from the government and professional websites. RESULTS: Over a 20-year period (2000-2019), the number of registered dentists increased from 31,325 to 42,469, a net increase of 36% (11,144 dentists), the majority of whom were international graduates (58%; n = 6,416) such that by December 2019, 28% of all registered dentists had qualified outside of the UK. Similarly, regarding new registrants, there were increases of graduates from UK (18%), EEA countries (214%) and, via the Overseas Registration Examination route (621%); and a decrease from countries with bilateral agreements for recognition (43%), in line with changes in health and immigration policies. CONCLUSIONS: International dental graduates increasingly contribute to the UK dental workforce and there is an urgent need for research into dentist migration and retention in the UK in support of patient access to dental care. IMPACT: The United Kingdom (UK) dental workforce is increasingly reliant on international dental graduates representing 28% of current registrants compared with 18% in 2000. Health policies and immigration policies were the main drivers that influenced dental workforce migration to the UK along with wider events, such as EU expansions, global recession and Brexit. Pre-existing lack of research into dental workforce could add to the uncertainties of post COVID-19 oral health care access and delivery.","Davda, Latha S; Radford, David R; Scambler, Sasha; Gallagher, Jennifer E",BDJ Open,,571

439181,Regulation and Trust: A Social Science Perspective on COVID-19 Mortality,2020,"The Covid-19 pandemic has focused attention on airborne transmission of viruses. Using realistic air flow simulation, we model droplet dispersion from coughing and study the transmission risk related to SARS-CoV-2. Although this model defines most airborne droplets as 8-16 µm in diameter, we infer that larger droplets of 32-40 µm in diameter may potentially be more infectious due to higher viral content. Use of face masks is therefore recommended for both personal and social protection. We found social distancing effective at reducing transmission potential across all droplet sizes. However, the presence of a human body 1 m away modifies the aerodynamics so that downstream droplet dispersion is enhanced, which has implications on safe distancing in queues. At 1 m distance, we found that an average of 0.55 viral copies is inhaled for a cough at median loading, scalable up to 340 copies at peak loading. Droplet evaporation results in significant reduction in droplet counts, but airborne transmission remains possible even under low humidity conditions.","Li, Hongying; Leong, Fong Yew; Xu, George; Kang, Chang Wei; Lim, Keng Hui; Tan, Ban Hock; Loo, Chian Min",Sci Rep,,571

DESIGN: Single centre cohort study. SETTING: Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei province, China. POPULATION: We studied 13 SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnant women diagnosed between 31 January and 9 March 2020. METHODS: We collected clinical data, vaginal secretions, stool specimens and breast milk from SARS-CoV-2-infected women during different stages of pregnancy and collected neonatal throat and anal swabs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We assessed viral presence in different biosamples. RESULTS: Of the 13 women with COVID-19, five were in their first trimester, three in their second trimester and five in their third trimester. Of the five women in their third trimester who gave birth, all delivered live newborns. Among these five deliveries, the primary adverse perinatal outcomes included premature delivery (n = 2) and neonatal pneumonia (n = 2). One of nine stool samples was positive; all 13 vaginal secretion samples, and five throat swabs and four anal swabs collected from neonates, were negative for the novel coronavirus. However, one of three samples of breast milk was positive by viral nucleic acid testing. CONCLUSIONS: In this case series of 13 pregnant women with COVID-19, we observed negative viral test results in vaginal secretion specimens, suggesting that a vaginal delivery may be a safe delivery option. However, additional research is urgently needed to examine breast milk and the potential risk for viral contamination.

442515,Covid-19 in the workplace,2020,"Autophagy is involved in the occurrence and development of tumors. Here, a pH-responsive polymersome codelivering hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and tunicamycin (Tuni) drugs is developed to simultaneously induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagic flux blockade for achieving an antitumor effect and inhibiting tumor metastasis. The pH response of poly(ß-amino ester) and HCQ synergistically deacidifies the lysosomes, thereby blocking the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes and lastly blocking autophagic flux. The function mechanism of regulating autophagy was systematically investigated on orthotopic luciferase gene-transfected, 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice through Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses. The Tuni triggers ER stress to regulate the PERK/Akt signaling pathway to increase the autophagic level. The ""autophagic stress"" generated by triggering ER stress-induced autophagy and blocking autophagic flux is effective against tumors. The reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 due to ER stress and reduced focal adhesions turnover due to the blockade of autophagic flux synergistically inhibit tumor metastasis.","Xu, Funeng; Li, Xilin; Huang, Xuehui; Pan, Jingmei; Wang, Yi; Zhou, Shaobing",Sci.

442590,Training and Deployment of Medical Students as Respiratory Therapist Extenders during COVID-19,2020,"CONTEXT: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic raised concerns about the safety of laparoscopy due to the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diffusion in surgical smoke. Although no case of SARS-CoV-2 contagion related to surgical smoke has been reported, several international surgical societies recommended caution or even discouraged the use of a laparoscopic approach. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of virus spread due to surgical smoke during surgical procedures. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We searched PubMed and Scopus for eligible studies, including clinical and preclinical studies assessing the presence of any virus in the surgical smoke from any surgical procedure or experimental model. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We identified 24 studies. No study was found investigating SARS-CoV-2 or any other coronavirus. About other viruses, hepatitis B virus was identified in the surgical smoke collected during different laparoscopic surgeries (colorectal resections, gastrectomies, and hepatic wedge resections). Other clinical studies suggested a consistent risk of transmission for human papillomavirus (HPV) in the surgical treatments of HPV-related disease (mainly genital warts, laryngeal papillomas, or cutaneous lesions). Preclinical studies showed conflicting results, but HPV was shown to have a high risk of transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Although all the available data come from different viruses, considering that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been shown in blood and stools, the theoretical risk of virus diffusion through surgical smoke cannot be excluded. Specific clinical studies are needed to understand the effective presence of the virus in the surgical smoke of different surgical procedures and its concentration. Meanwhile, adoption of all the required protective strategies, including preoperative patient nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19, seems mandatory. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this systematic review, we looked at the risk of virus spread from surgical smoke exposure during surgery. Although no study was found investigating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or any other coronavirus, we found that the theoretical risk of virus diffusion through surgical smoke cannot be excluded.","Pavan, Nicola; Crestani, Alessandro; Abrate, Alberto; Nunzio, Cosimo De; Esperto, Francesco; Giannarini, Gianluca; Galfano, Antonio; Gregori, Andrea; Liguori, Giovanni; Bartoletti, Riccardo; Porpiglia, Francesco; Simonato, Alchiede; Trombetta, Carlo; Tubaro, Andrea; Ficarra, Vincenzo; Novara, Giacomo",Eur Urol Focus,,571

442988,Address COVID-19 Issues With Volunteers,2020,"The current study investigated the effectiveness of a group on-line positive psychology intervention (OPPI) designed to mitigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent measures to control it. Study participants (N = 82, M age = 33.07, SD = 9.55) were all Greek adults divided into an intervention (n = 44) and a control group (n = 38). The intervention group attended a voluntary, online, two-week, six-session (each 50 min), group intervention. The intervention aimed at enhancing participants' personal strengths and resilience in order to cope more effectively with the psychological impact of social distancing (e.g., feelings of anxiety, sadness, fear, and/or loneliness). All participants completed an online questionnaire one week before the intervention's implementation, which included scales measuring their: demographic characteristics, empathy, resilience, affectivity, feelings of loneliness, depression and anxiety levels, and feelings of fear regarding the outbreak. Participants in both the intervention and control group completed the same measures the week following the intervention's termination to examine its effects, and two weeks later to examine its long-term effectiveness. The intervention was found to be effective in alleviating the impact of the pandemic and in strengthening participants' resilience. More specifically, the results showed significant decreases for the intervention group in all measures of psychosocial distress (anxiety, depression, loneliness and fear) and significant increases in empathy, resilience, and experience of positive emotions. The study's implications for the development and implementation of online psychological interventions during a crisis are discussed.","Brouzos, Andreas; Vassilopoulos, Stephanos P; Baourda, Vasiliki C; Tassi, Christina; Stavrou, Vaia; Moschou, Kalliopi; Brouzou, Katia Ourania",Curr Psychol,,571

According to past studies, positive support within married couples reduces stress during diseases and disasters, but their mechanisms are unclear. To address this gap and help individuals better cope with COVID-19-related psychological distress, this study examined the relationships among daily positive support, daily gratitude, and daily stress within married couples. In this 14-day daily diary study, 54 heterosexually married couples (N = 108) aged 28 to 71 years participated. After reporting their demographic information at the start of the study, they reported their perceived positive support from their partner, daily stress, and feelings of gratitude at the end of each day of the study for 14 consecutive days. Using a multivariate outcome, multilevel cross-classification, we found that daily positive support was negatively associated with daily stress, mediated by daily feelings of gratitude. On a day when a person reported more perceived positive support than others, this person also reported a higher level of feelings of gratitude and a lower level of stress, regardless of age. We found only an actor effect, no partner effect. These findings show how greater daily positive support is linked to greater daily feelings of gratitude, which in turn is linked to less daily stress during an emergent public health crisis.

Several studies have reported that cytokine storms are an important cause of disease deterioration and death in COVID-19 patients. Consequently, it is important to understand the specific pathophysiological processes underlying how cytokine storms promote the deterioration of COVID-19. Here, we outline the pathophysiological processes through which cytokine storms contribute to the deterioration of SARS-CoV-2 infection and describe the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system, as well as the pathophysiology of immune response dysfunction that leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and coagulation impairment. Treatments based on inhibiting cytokine storm-induced deterioration and occurrence are also described.","Chen, Ruirong; Lan, Zhien; Ye, Jujian; Pang, Limin; Liu, Yi; Wu, Wei; Qin, Xiaohuan; Guo, Yang; Zhang, Peidong",Front Immunol,,571
444527,Addressing Health Disparities From a Syndemic Perspective,2021,"The velocity of the COVID-19 pandemic spread and the variable severity of the disease course has forced scientists to search for potential predictors of the disease outcome. We examined various immune parameters including the markers of immune cells exhaustion and activation in 21 patients with COVID-19 disease hospitalised in our hospital during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Slovakia. The results showed significant progressive lymphopenia and depletion of lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and CD19+) in correlation to the disease severity. Clinical recovery was associated with significant increase in CD3+ and CD3+CD4+ T-cells. Most of our patients had eosinopenia on admission, although no significant differences were seen among groups with different disease severity. Non-survivors, when compared to survivors, had significantly increased expression of PD-1 on CD4+ and CD8+ cells, but no significant difference in Tim-3 expression was observed, what suggests possible reversibility of immune paralysis in the most severe group of patients. During recovery, the expression of Tim-3 on both CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ cells significantly decreased. Moreover, patients with fatal outcome had significantly higher proportion of CD38+CD8+ cells and lower proportion of CD38+HLA-DR+CD8+ cells on admission. Clinical recovery was associated with significant decrease of proportion of CD38+CD8+ cells. The highest AUC values within univariate and multivariate logistic regression were achieved for expression of CD38 on CD8+ cells and expression of PD1 on CD4+ cells alone or combined, what suggests, that these parameters could be used as potential biomarkers of poor outcome. The assessment of immune markers could help in predicting outcome and disease severity in COVID-19 patients. Our observations suggest, that apart from the degree of depletion of total lymphocytes and lymphocytes subsets, increased expression of CD38 on CD3+CD8+ cells alone or combined with increased expression of PD-1 on CD3+CD4+ cells, should be regarded as a risk factor of an unfavourable outcome in COVID-19 patients. Increased expression of PD-1 in the absence of an increased expression of Tim-3 on CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ cells suggests potential reversibility of ongoing immune paralysis in patients with the most severe course of COVID-19.","Bobcakova, Anna; Petriskova, Jela; Vysehradsky, Robert; Kocan, Ivan; Kapustova, Lenka; Barnova, Martina; Diamant, Zuzana; Jesenak, Milos",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,571

The key component of VV-ECMO is the double-lumen cannula (DLC) that enables single-site access. The biofluid dynamics of this compact device is particularly challenging for neonatal patients due to high Reynolds numbers, tricuspid valve location and right-atrium hemodynamics. In this paper we present detailed findings of our comparative analysis of the right-atrial hemodynamics and salient design features of the 13Fr Avalon Elite DLC (as the clinically preferred neonatal cannula) with the alternate Origen DLC design, using experimentally validated computational fluid dynamics. Highly accurate 3D-reconstructions of both devices were obtained through an integrated optical coherence tomography and micro-CT imaging approach. Both cannula configurations displayed complex flow structures inside the atrium, superimposed over predominant recirculation regimes. We found that the Avalon DLC performed significantly better than the Origen alternative, by capturing 80% and 94% of venous blood from the inferior and superior vena cavae, respectively and infusing the oxygenated blood with an efficiency of more than 85%. The micro-scale geometric design features of the Avalon DLC that are associated with superior hemodynamics were investigated through 14 parametric cannula configurations. These simulations showed that the strategic placement of drainage holes, the smooth infusion blood stream diverter and efficient distribution of the venous blood capturing area between the vena cavae are associated with robust blood flow performance. Nevertheless, our parametric results indicate that there is still room for further device optimization beyond the performance measurements for both Avalon and Origen DLC in this study. In particular, the performance envelope of malpositioned cannula and off-design conditions require additional blood flow simulations for analysis.","Rasooli, Reza; Jamil, Muhammad; Rezaeimoghaddam, Mohammad; Yildiz, Yahya; Salihoglu, Ece; Pekkan, Kerem",J Biomech,,571

Measures such as strategic natural ventilation and high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration remain poorly implemented and mask mandates are often progressively lifted as vaccination rollout is enhanced. MethodsWe adapted a previously developed aerosol transmission model to study the effect of interventions (natural ventilation, face masks, HEPA filtration, and their combinations) on the concentration of virus particles in a classroom of 160 m3 containing one infectious individual. The cumulative dose of viruses absorbed by exposed occupants was calculated. ResultsThe most effective single intervention was natural ventilation through the full opening of six windows all day during the winter (14-fold decrease in cumulative dose), followed by the universal use of surgical face masks (8-fold decrease). In the spring/summer, natural ventilation was only effective ([≥] 2-fold decrease) when windows were fully open all day. In the winter, partly opening two windows all day or fully opening six windows at the end of each class was effective as well ([≥] 2-fold decrease). Opening windows during yard and lunch breaks only had minimal effect ([≤] 1.2-fold decrease). One HEPA filter was as effective as two windows partly open all day during the winter (2.5-fold decrease) while two filters were more effective (4-fold decrease). Combined interventions (i.e., natural ventilation, masks, and HEPA filtration) were the most effective ([≥] 30-fold decrease). Combined interventions remained highly effective in the presence of a super-spreader. ConclusionsNatural ventilation, face masks, and HEPA filtration are effective interventions to reduce SARS-CoV-2 aerosol transmission. These measures should be combined and complemented by additional interventions (e.g., physical distancing, hygiene, testing, contact tracing, and vaccination) to maximize benefit.","Villers, Jennifer; Henriques, Andre; Calarco, Serafina; Rognlien, Markus; Mounet, Nicolas; Devine, James; Azzopardi, Gabriella; Elson, Philip; Andreini, Marco; Tarocco, Nicola; Vassella, Claudia C; Keiser, Olivia",,,571
444950,How Head Start Addressed COVID-19 Challenges,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected health and economy worldwide on an unprecedented scale. Patients have diverse clinical outcomes, but those with preexisting cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and related conditions incur disproportionately worse outcome. The high infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is in part related to new mutations in the receptor binding domain, and acquisition of a furin cleavage site in the S-spike protein. The continued viral shedding in the asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals enhances its community transmission. The virus uses the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor for internalization, aided by transmembrane protease serine 2 protease. The tissue localization of the receptors correlates with COVID-19 presenting symptoms and organ dysfunction. Virus-induced angiotensin converting enzyme 2 downregulation may attenuate its function, diminish its anti-inflammatory role, and heighten angiotensin II effects in the predisposed patients. Lymphopenia occurs early and is prognostic, potentially associated with reduction of the CD4+ and some CD8+ T cells. This leads to imbalance of the innate/acquired immune response, delayed viral clearance, and hyperstimulated macrophages and neutrophils. Appropriate type I interferon pathway activation is critical for virus attenuation and balanced immune response. Persistent immune activation in predisposed patients, such as elderly adults and those with cardiovascular risk, can lead to hemophagocytosis-like syndrome, with uncontrolled amplification of cytokine production, leading to multiorgan failure and death. In addition to the airways and lungs, the cardiovascular system is often involved in COVID-19 early, reflected in the release of highly sensitive troponin and natriuretic peptides, which are all extremely prognostic, in particular, in those showing continued rise, along with cytokines such as interleukin-6. Inflammation in the vascular system can result in diffuse microangiopathy with thrombosis. Inflammation in the myocardium can result in myocarditis, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, rapid deterioration, and sudden death. Aggressive support based on early prognostic indicators with expectant management can potentially improve recovery. Appropriate treatment for heart failure, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, and thrombosis remain important. Specific evidence-based treatment strategies for COVID-19 will emerge with ongoing global collaboration on multiple approaches being evaluated. To protect the wider population, antibody testing and effective vaccine will be needed to make COVID-19 history.","Liu, Peter P; Blet, Alice; Smyth, David; Li, Hongliang",Circulation,,571

Methods: An ecological study comparing the CDC SVI and census tract-level COVID-19 case counts was conducted. Choropleth maps were used to identify census tracts with high levels of both social vulnerability and COVID-19 incidence. Negative binomial regression with random intercepts was used to compare the relationship between overall CDC SVI percentile and its four sub-themes and COVID-19 incidence, adjusting for population density. Results: In a crude stratified analysis, all four CDC SVI sub-themes were significantly associated with COVID-19 incidence. Census tracts with higher levels of social vulnerability were associated with higher COVID-19 incidence after adjusting for population density (adjusted RR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.41-1.65). Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that increased social vulnerability is linked with COVID-19 incidence. Additional resources should be allocated to areas of increased social disadvantage to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 in vulnerable populations.","Biggs, Erin N; Maloney, Patrick M; Rung, Ariane L; Peters, Edward S; Robinson, William T",Front Public Health,,571

Various strategies to counter this gloomy reality and speed up vaccination have been set forth, of which the most popular approach has been to delay the second vaccine dose for a longer period than originally recommended by the manufacturers. Controversy has surrounded this strategy, and overly simplistic models have been developed to shed light on this issue. Here we use three different epidemic models, all accounting for the actual COVID-19 epidemic in the Czech Republic, including the rise and eventual prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus and real vaccination rollout strategy, to explore when delaying the second vaccine dose from 21 days to 42 days is advantageous. Using the numbers of COVID-19-related deaths as a quantity for comparing various model scenarios, we find that vaccine mode of action at the beginning of the infection course (preventing contagion and symptom appearance), mild epidemic and sufficient vaccine supply rate call for the original inter-delay scenario of 21 days regardless of vaccine efficacy. On the contrary, for vaccine mode of action at the end of infection course (preventing severe symptoms and death), severe epidemic and low vaccine supply rate, the 42-day inter-dose period is preferable, at any plausible vaccine efficacy. One sentence summaryWe address when delaying the second vaccine dose is advantageous, considering various epidemic severities and various vaccine actions and availabilities.","Berec, Ludek; Levinsky, Rene; Weiner, Jakub; Smid, Martin; Neruda, Roman; Vidnerova, Petra; Suchoparova, Gabriela",,,571

This work aimed to study the immobilising process of gallic acid in the antibacterial activity of L. innocua and its toxicological properties in vivo using Caenorhabditis elegans. The experiment was based on obtaining the minimum bactericidal concentration for free and immobilised gallic acid by comparing lethality, locomotion behaviour, chemotaxis and thermal stress resistance on C.elegans at those concentrations. The results showed a lowering minimum bactericidal concentration and modifications to nematode responses. Increased lethality and velocity of movements was observed. Immobilisation increased the repellent effect of gallic acid with a negative chemotaxis index. Thermal stress resistance was also affected, with higher mortality for immobilised gallic acid compared to bare particles and free gallic acid. Thus despite evidencing a generalised increase in the toxicity of gallic acid in vivo, lowering the minimum bactericidal concentration allowed a bacterial reduction of 99 % with less than one third of mortality for the nematodes exposed to free gallic acid.","Verdú, Samuel; Ruiz-Rico, María; Perez, Alberto J; Barat, José M; Talens, Pau; Grau, Raúl",Environ Toxicol Pharmacol,,571

Following entry, bacteria disrupt the invasion vacuole and reach the cytoplasm where they replicate and use the actin cytoskeleton to propel themselves from cell to cell. Mammalian epithelial cells grown in vitro can be used to study the different steps of the intracellular life of Listeria. However, rapid multiplication and dissemination of bacteria can induce important cell death and detachment, resulting in the formation of lytic plaques. Thus, in vitro infections with L. monocytogenes are usually restricted to short time courses, from a few minutes to one day. Here, we present a method to study long-term L. monocytogenes infections in epithelial cells using epifluorescence microscopy. This protocol enables the observation of actin-based motility, intercellular dissemination foci, and entrapment of L. monocytogenes within vacuoles of persistence termed ""Listeria-Containing Vacuoles"" (LisCVs). We also describe a protocol to study the recruitment of cytoskeletal proteins at Listeria actin comet tails, as well as a method to assess the membrane integrity of intracellular bacteria using a LIVE/DEAD viability assay.","Bierne, Hélène; Kortebi, Mounia; Descoeudres, Natalie",Methods Mol Biol,,571

Use of saliva as a diagnostic specimen may present opportunities for SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing in remote and low-resource settings. Determining the stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva over time is an important step in determining optimal storage and transport times. We undertook an in vitro study to assess whether SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in contrived saliva samples. The contrived saliva samples comprised 10 ml pooled saliva spiked with gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 to achieve a concentration of 2.58×104 copies ml SARS-CoV-2, which was subsequently divided into 2 ml aliquots comprising: (i) neat saliva; and a 1â:â1 dilution with (ii) normal saline; (iii) viral transport media, and (iv) liquid Amies medium. Contrived samples were made in quadruplicate, with two samples of each stored at either: (i) room temperature or (ii) 4 °C.

451382,Serious Financial Burdens Facing U.S. Households with Employment Loss During COVID-19,2021,"RaTG13 is a close relative of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, sharing 96% sequence similarity at the genome-wide level. The spike receptor binding domain (RBD) of RaTG13 contains a large number of amino acid substitutions when compared to SARS-CoV-2, likely impacting affinity for the ACE2 receptor. Antigenic differences between the viruses are less well understood, especially whether RaTG13 spike can be efficiently neutralised by antibodies generated from infection with, or vaccination against, SARS-CoV-2. Using RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes we compared neutralisation using convalescent sera from previously infected patients as well as vaccinated healthcare workers. Surprisingly, our results revealed that RaTG13 was more efficiently neutralised than SARS-CoV-2. In addition, neutralisation assays using spike chimeras and mutants harbouring single amino acid substitutions within the RBD demonstrated that both spike proteins can tolerate multiple changes without dramatically reducing how efficiently they are neutralised. Moreover, introducing the 484K mutation into RaTG13 resulted in increased neutralisation, in contrast to the same mutation in SARS-CoV-2 (E484K).

Network evolution is formulated as a link-Markovian process, which is then coupled to an individual-level stochastic SIR model, in order to describe the interplay between epidemic dynamics on a network and network link changes. A Markov chain Monte Carlo framework is developed for likelihood-based inference from partial epidemic observations, with a novel data augmentation algorithm specifically designed to deal with missing individual recovery times under the dynamic network setting. Through a series of simulation experiments, we demonstrate the validity and flexibility of the model as well as the efficacy and efficiency of the data augmentation inference scheme. The model is also applied to a recent real-world dataset on influenza-like-illness transmission with high-resolution social contact tracking records.","Bu, Fan; Aiello, Allison E.; Xu, Jason; Volfovsky, Alexander",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.04221v2.pdf,571

Emerging evidence demonstrates that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is associated with central nervous system disease. We describe central nervous system manifestations in critical patients with COVID-19 at our tertiary center. METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective analysis of all actively critical patients with COVID-19 admitted to our tertiary care academic center in New Orleans, Louisiana, on April 22, 2020, with new onset of neurologic disease. Patients were grouped into 1 of 3 categories according to imaging and clinical features; encephalopathy, acute necrotizing encephalopathy, and vasculopathy. RESULTS: A total of 27 of 76 (35.5%) critical patients with COVID-19 met inclusion criteria. Twenty patients (74%) were designated with COVID-19-associated encephalopathy, 2 (7%) with COVID-19-associated acute necrotizing encephalopathy, and 5 (19%) with COVID-19-associated vasculopathy. Sixty-three percent of neurologic findings were demonstrated on computed tomography, 30% on magnetic resonance imaging, and 44% on electroencephalography. Findings most often included ischemic strokes, diffuse hypoattenuation, subcortical parenchymal hemorrhages, and focal hypodensities within deep structures. Magnetic resonance imaging findings included diffuse involvement of deep white matter, the corpus callosum, and the basal ganglia. For patients with large-territory ischemic stroke, all but one displayed irregular proximal focal stenosis of the supraclinoid internal carotid artery. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of active critical COVID-19 admissions at our revealed a high percentage of patients with new neurologic disease. Although variable, presentations followed 1 of 3 broad categories. A better understanding of the neurologic sequalae and radiographic findings will help clinicians mitigate the impact of this disease.","Scullen, Tyler; Keen, Joseph; Mathkour, Mansour; Dumont, Aaron S; Kahn, Lora",World Neurosurg,,571

It is important to address mental health needs and not to ignore the psychological dimension in this group of patients. In this regard, the first practical step is to have a clear understanding of patients' psychological issues. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the psychological disturbances of COVID-19 survivors throughout the disease crisis. METHOD: This qualitative study was conducted using a phenomenological approach through 14 individual semi-structured in-depth interviews with patients recovered from COVID-19. Data were analyzed using Colaizzi's seven-step method. RESULTS: Three themes of ""living in limbo"", ""psychological distress behind the wall"" and ""psychological burden of being a carrier"" were extracted as the psychological disturbances of COVID-19 survivors throughout the disease crisis. CONCLUSION: This study portrayed a better understanding of psychological disturbances of COVID-19 survivors throughout the disease crisis based on their lived experiences. Given the ambiguity in the time of the disease eradication and its continuing course, a deep understanding of these experiences in the current critical situation can help healthcare officials to make appropriate decisions and take measures to assess and identify psychological traumas and perform interventions to improve the mental state of these patients.","Moradi, Yaser; Mollazadeh, Farzin; Karimi, Parivash; Hosseingholipour, Keyvan; Baghaei, Rahim",BMC Psychiatry,,571

RESULTS: Our pre-COVID study population consisted of 498 patients, speaking 17 primary languages; primarily, the population had MediCal or no insurance coverage (56.8%). Most had the capability to take part in telemedicine video calls (73.1%), though significantly fewer had the confidence (45.9%) or interest (51%). There was a distinct drop in capability, confidence, and interest with increasing age but not with preferred language. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we noted increased interest in non-traditional visits (n=100), with 79% stating they would repeat a non-in-person visit. CONCLUSION: Increasing interest in non-traditional visits during the COVID-19 pandemic suggests patient interest and confidence may be malleable.","Josipovic, Andin; Reese, Jeffrey; Cantarero, Erin C; Elliott, Christopher S",J Health Care Poor Underserved,,571
454439,Despatches from the frontline: Parish responses to COVID-19 and some initial analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: Preventing medical errors is crucial, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is the most widely prospective hazard analysis used in healthcare. FMEA relies on brainstorming by multi-disciplinary teams to identify hazards. This approach has two major weaknesses: significant time and human resources investments, and lack of complete, and error free results. OBJECTIVES: To introduce the algorithmic prediction of failure modes in healthcare (APFMH); to examine whether APFMH is leaner in resources allocation in comparison to the traditional FMEA and whether it ensures complete identification of hazards. METHODS: The patient identification during imaging process at the emergency department of Sheba Medical Center, was analyzed by FMEA and APFMH, independently and separately. We compared the hazards predicted by APFMH and FMEA methods; the total participants' working hours invested in each process; adverse events, categorized as ""patient identification"", before and after the recommendations resulted from the above processes were implemented. RESULTS: APFMH is more effective in identifying hazards (P<0.0001) and is leaner in resources than the traditional FMEA: the former used 21 hours whereas the latter required 63. Following implementing the recommendations, the adverse events decreased by 44% annually (P=0.0026). Most adverse events were preventable, had all recommendations have been fully implemented. CONCLUSION: In the light of our initial and limited in size study, APFMH is more effective in identifying hazards (P<0.0001) and is leaner in resources than the traditional FMEA. APFMH is suggested as an alternative to FMEA that is leaner in time and human resources, ensures more complete hazard identification and is especially valuable during crisis time, when new protocols are often adopted, such as in the current days of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kobo-Greenhut, Ayala; Sharlin, Ortal; Adler, Yael; Peer, Nitza; Eisenberg, Vered H; Barbi, Merav; Levy, Talia; Ben Shlomo, Izhar; Zimlichman, Eyal",Int. j. qual. health care,,571

Pro-drug activation, a modality of cancer therapy leads to Ganciclovir triphosphate (GCV-TP) incorporation into newly synthesized DNA resulting in cell death. The objective was to enhance, with Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and All Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA), GJIC, crucial for drug delivery, and with combination, abrogate the observed detrimental effect of Dexamethasone (DXM). METHODS: Cell lines (NT8E, and HeLa) were pre-treated with Valproic Acid (VPA) (1 mM), 4 Phenyl Butyrate (4PB) (2 mM), ATRA (10 µM) and Dexamethasone (1 µM). Protein quantitated with the Bicinchoninic (BCA) assay for cell lysates, membrane and soluble fractions was assessed with Western blotting for Connexins (43, 26 and 32) and E-Cadherin. A qRT-PCR was done for CX 43-GJA1, CX 26-GJB2, CX 32-GJB1 and E-Cadherin, and normalized with Glyceraldehyde Phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Further, localization of Connexins (CX) and E-Cadherin, GJIC competence, pre-clinical in-vitro studies and the mechanism of cell death were evaluated. RESULTS: There was no toxicity or change in growth patterns observed with the drugs. In both the cell lines CX 43 localized to the membrane whereas CX 32 and CX 26 were present but not membrane bound. E-Cadherin was present on the membrane in NT8E and completely absent in HeLa cells. Effects of HDACi, DXM and ATRA were seen on the expression of Connexins and E-Cadherin in both the cell lines. NT8E and HeLa cell lines showed enhanced GJIC with 4PB [30 %], VPA [36 %] and ATRA [54 %] with a 60 % increase in cytotoxicity and an abrogation of Dexamethasone inhibition on combination with VPA or ATRA. CONCLUSION: An enhancement of GJIC function by HDACi and ATRA increased cytotoxicity and could be effective in the presence of Dexamethasone, when combined with ATRA or VPA.","Warawdekar, Ujjwala M; Jain, Vaishali; Patel, Himani; Nanda, Adyasha; Kamble, Vishal",Curr Res Transl Med,,571

To explore further the relationship between obesity and critical illness in COVID-19, we examined the association of body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) with baseline demographic and ICU parameters, laboratory values, and outcomes in a critically ill patient cohort. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we examined the first 277 consecutive patients admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) intensive care units (ICUs) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We measured BMI class, initial ICU laboratory values, physiologic characteristics including gas exchange and ventilatory mechanics, and ICU interventions as clinically available. Mortality, length of ICU admission, and duration of mechanical ventilation were measured. RESULTS: We found no difference in respiratory system compliance or oxygenation between patients with and without obesity. Patients without obesity had higher initial ferritin and D-dimer levels than patients with obesity. Standard ARDS management including prone ventilation was equally distributed between BMI groups. We found no difference in outcomes between BMI groups, including 30- and 60-day mortality and duration of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of critically ill patients with COVID-19, obesity was not associated with meaningful differences in respiratory physiology, inflammatory profile, or clinical outcomes.","Wolf, Molly; Alladina, Jehan; Navarrete-Welton, Allison; Shoults, Benjamin; Brait, Kelsey; Ziehr, David; Malhotra, Atul; Hardin, C Corey; Hibbert, Kathryn A",Obesity (Silver Spring),,571
454947,The Relationship Between COVID-19 Cases and COVID-19 Testing: a Panel Data Analysis on OECD Countries,2021,"The appearance of a new dangerous and contagious disease requires the development of a drug therapy faster than what is foreseen by usual mechanisms. Many drug therapy developments consist in investigating through different clinical trials the effects of different specific drug combinations by delivering it into a test group of ill patients, meanwhile a placebo treatment is delivered to the remaining ill patients, known as the control group. We compare the above technique to a new technique in which all patients receive a different and reasonable combination of drugs and use this outcome to feed a Neural Network. By averaging out fluctuations and recognizing different patient features, the Neural Network learns the pattern that connects the patients initial state to the outcome of the treatments and therefore can predict the best drug therapy better than the above method. In contrast to many available works, we do not study any detail of drugs composition nor interaction, but instead pose and solve the problem from a phenomenological point of view, which allows us to compare both methods. Although the conclusion is reached through mathematical modeling and is stable upon any reasonable model, this is a proof-of-concept that should be studied within other expertises before confronting a real scenario. All calculations, tools and scripts have been made open source for the community to test, modify or expand it. Finally it should be mentioned that, although the results presented here are in the context of a new disease in medical sciences, these are useful for any field that requires a experimental technique with a control group.","Alvarez, Ezequiel; Lamagna, Federico; Szewc, Manuel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.12454v1.pdf,571
455254,Triage tool for suspected COVID-19 patients in the emergency room: AIFELL score,2020,"Novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2continues tospread rapidly worldwide and causing serious health and economic loss. In the absence of any effective treatment, various in-silico approaches are being explored towards the therapeutic discovery against COVID-19. Targeting multiple key enzymes of SARS-CoV-2 with a single potential drug could be an important in-silico strategy to tackle the therapeutic emergency. A number of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs entered into clinical stages were originated from multi-target approaches with an increased rate, 16-21% between 2015 and 2017. In this study, we selected an FDA-approved library (Prestwick Chemical Library of 1520 compounds) and implemented in-silico virtual screening against multiple protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 on the Glide module of Schrödinger software (release 2020-1). Compounds were analyzed for their docking scores and the top-ranked against each targeted protein were further subjected to Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to assess the binding stability of ligand-protein complexes. A multi-targeting approach was optimized that enabled the analysis of several compounds' binding efficiency with more than one protein targets. It was demonstrated that Diosmin (6) showed the highest binding affinity towards multiple targets with binding free energy (kcal/mol) values of -63.39 (nsp3); -62.89 (nsp9); -31.23 (nsp12); and -65.58 (nsp15). Therefore, our results suggests that Diosmin (6) possesses multi-targeting capability, a potent inhibitor of various non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, and thus it deserves further validation experiments before using as a therapeutic against COVID-19 disease.","Kumar, Sumit; Sharma, Prem Prakash; Upadhyay, Charu; Kempaiah, Prakasha; Rathi, Brijesh",Methods (S.

On the Future of Contact Restrictions in the COVID-19Crisis,2020,"In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown origin was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Pneumonia cases were epidemiologically linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Inoculation of respiratory samples into human airway epithelial cells, Vero E6 and Huh7 cell lines, led to the isolation of a novel respiratory virus whose genome analysis showed it to be a novel coronavirus related to SARS-CoV, and therefore named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus belonging to the subgenus Sarbecovirus. The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the thousands of deaths caused by coronavirus disease (COVID-19) led the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic on 12 March 2020. To date, the world has paid a high toll in this pandemic in terms of human lives lost, economic repercussions and increased poverty. In this review, we provide information regarding the epidemiology, serological and molecular diagnosis, origin of SARS-CoV-2 and its ability to infect human cells, and safety issues. Then we focus on the available therapies to fight COVID-19, the development of vaccines, the role of artificial intelligence in the management of the pandemic and limiting the spread of the virus, the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on our lifestyle, and preparation for a possible second wave.","Ciotti, Marco; Ciccozzi, Massimo; Terrinoni, Alessandro; Jiang, Wen-Can; Wang, Cheng-Bin; Bernardini, Sergio",Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci,,571

456374,Fallbericht über eine an COVID-19 erkrankte Patientin mit bestehendem Schmerzsyndrom,2020,"BACKGROUND: No set guidelines to guide disposition decisions from the emergency department (ED) in patients with COVID-19 exist. Our goal was to determine characteristics that identify patients at high risk for adverse outcomes who may need admission to the hospital instead of an observation unit. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 116 adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to an ED observation unit. We included patients with bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging, COVID-19 testing performed, and/or COVID-19 suspected as the primary diagnosis. The primary outcome was hospital admission. We assessed risk factors associated with this outcome using univariate and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 116 patients, 33 or 28% (95% confidence interval [CI] 20-37%) required admission from the observation unit. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, we found that hypoxia defined as room-air oxygen saturation < 95% (OR 3.11, CI 1.23-7.88) and bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography (OR 5.57, CI 1.66-18.96) were independently associated with hospital admission, after adjusting for age. Two three-factor composite predictor models, age > 48 years, bilateral infiltrates, hypoxia, and Hispanic race, bilateral infiltrates, hypoxia yield an OR for admission of 4.99 (CI 1.50-16.65) with an AUC of 0.59 (CI 0.51-0.67) and 6.78 (CI 2.11-21.85) with an AUC of 0.62 (CI 0.54-0.71), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Over 1/4 of suspected COVID-19 patients admitted to an ED observation unit ultimately required admission to the hospital. Risk factors associated with admission include hypoxia, bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography, or the combination of these two factors plus either age > 48 years or Hispanic race.","Russell, Frances M; Wang, Alfred; Ehrman, Robert R; Jacobs, Jake; Croft, Alex; Larsen, Caleb",Am. j. emerg. med,,571

Yet, there are few randomized trials demonstrating that reducing SB improves cardiovascular health. The Effect of Reducing Sedentary Behavior on Blood Pressure (RESET BP) randomized clinical trial addresses this gap by testing the effect of a 3-month SB reduction intervention on resting systolic BP. Secondary outcomes include other BP measures, pulse wave velocity, plasma renin activity and aldosterone, and objectively-measured SB (via thigh-mounted activPAL) and physical activity (via waist-worn GT3X accelerometer). RESET BP has a targeted recruitment of 300 adults with desk jobs, along with elevated, non-medicated BP (systolic BP 120-159 mmHg or diastolic BP 80-99 mmHg) and physical inactivity (self-reported aerobic physical activity below recommended levels). The multi-component intervention promotes 2-4 fewer hours of SB per day by replacing sitting with standing and light-intensity movement breaks. Participants assigned to the intervention condition receive a sit-stand desk attachment, a wrist-worn activity prompter, behavioral counseling every two weeks (alternating in-person and phone), and twice-weekly automated text messages. Herein, we review the study rationale, describe and evaluate recruitment strategies based on enrollment to date, and detail the intervention and assessment protocols. We also document our mid-trial adaptations to participant recruitment, intervention deployment, and outcome assessments due to the intervening COVID-19 pandemic. Our research methods, experiences to date, and COVID-specific accommodations could inform other research studying BP and hypertension or targeting working populations, including those seeking remote methods.","Barone Gibbs, Bethany; Conroy, Molly B; Huber, Kimberly; Muldoon, Matthew F; Perera, Subashan; Jakicic, John M",Contemp Clin Trials,,571

Passion fruits were procured and handled in a very hygienic manner. The formulation of stirred fruit yogurts was carried out in three different ratios (10%, 15%, and 20% pulp). These samples were standardized by sensory evaluation (9 points hedonic scale) and physicochemical parameters (pH). Fruit yogurt made from 20% passion fruit pulp scored the highest value in the mean score (8.5±0.17) for sensory evaluation except for texture. The pH value of the passion fruit yogurt was 3.5 found and it was more acidic compared to the plain yogurt value of 3.7 because of the addition of fruit pulp which was balanced by the addition of sugar/stevia. The acceptability of the stirred probiotic fruit yogurt with 20% pulp was mainly because of the flavoring compounds of the yellow passion fruit (P. edulis Sims f. flavicarpa Deg). © 2021, Editorial board of Journal of Experimental Biology and Agricultural Sciences.

Although COVID-19 has been extensively characterized clinically, the factors distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from other respiratory viruses are unknown. Here, we compared the clinical, histopathological, and immunological characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and pandemic influenza A(H1N1). We observed a higher frequency of respiratory symptoms, increased tissue injury markers, and a histological pattern of alveolar pneumonia in pandemic influenza A(H1N1) patients. Conversely, dry cough, gastrointestinal symptoms and interstitial lung pathology were observed in COVID-19 cases. Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) was characterized by higher levels of IL-1RA, TNF-&#945;, CCL3, G-CSF, APRIL, sTNF-R1, sTNF-R2, sCD30, and sCD163. Meanwhile, COVID-19 displayed an immune profile distinguished by increased Th1 (IL-12, IFN-Î³) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13) cytokine levels, along with IL-1ß, IL-6, CCL11, VEGF, TWEAK, TSLP, MMP-1, and MMP-3. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 induces a dysbalanced polyfunctional inflammatory response that is different from the immune response against pandemic influenza A(H1N1). Furthermore, we demonstrated the diagnostic potential of some clinical and immune factors to differentiate both diseases. These findings might be relevant for the ongoing and future influenza seasons in the Northern Hemisphere, which are historically unique due to their convergence with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Choreño-Parra, José Alberto; Jiménez-Álvarez, Luis Armando; Cruz-Lagunas, Alfredo; Rodríguez-Reyna, Tatiana Sofía; Ramírez-Martínez, Gustavo; Sandoval-Vega, Montserrat; Hernández-García, Diana Lizzeth; Choreño-Parra, Eduardo M; Balderas-Martínez, Yalbi I; Martinez-Sánchez, Mariana Esther; Márquez-García, Eduardo; Sciutto, Edda; Moreno-Rodríguez, José; Barreto-Rodríguez, José Omar; Vázquez-Rojas, Hazel; Centeno-Sáenz, Gustavo Iván; Alvarado-Peña, Néstor; Salinas-Lara, Citlaltepetl; Sánchez-Garibay, Carlos; Galeana-Cadena, David; Hernández, Gabriela; Mendoza-Milla, Criselda; Domínguez, Andrea; Granados, Julio; Mena-Hernández, Lula; Pérez-Buenfil, Luis Ángel; Domínguez-Cheritt, Guillermo; Cabello-Gutiérrez, Carlos; Luna-Rivero, Cesar; Salas-Hernández, Jorge; Santillán-Doherty, Patricio; Regalado, Justino; Hernández-Martínez, Angélica; Orozco, Lorena; Ávila-Moreno, Federico; García-Latorre, Ethel A; Hernández-Cárdenas, Carmen M; Khader, Shabaana A; Zlotnik, Albert; Zúñiga, Joaquín",Front Immunol,,571

OBJECTIVE: To report our experience with critically ill children with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of children with COVID-19 who were admitted Feb. 25 to May 1, 2020. We reviewed patient demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, requirement for respiratory support, evidence of acute myocardial injury, and chest radiographs. RESULTS: The study included 19 children and adolescents (ages 2 months to 18 years, median 8 years; 10 males, 9 females; 18 COVID-19-positive, 1 COVID-19-negative with positive exposure). Presenting symptoms included fever (89%), cough (68%), respiratory distress (68%) and vomiting/diarrhea (47%). Comorbidities were present in 12 (63%). Fourteen required intensive care; eight required intubation. Two children died. Five patients developed acute myocarditis (median age 7 years); in all five, chest radiographs were notable for cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion or interstitial edema. Of these five, one (age 18 years), who had underlying hypertension and obesity, developed multifocal pneumonia and renal failure. The other four were previously healthy; three (ages 5 years, 7 years, 8 years) were subsequently diagnosed with multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C); one developed pulmonary opacities consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome, three (60%) had no parenchymal pulmonary opacities. Fourteen patients (median 13 years), most with comorbidities, had no acute myocardial injury. Chest radiographs in 13 (93%) demonstrated parenchymal lung disease with a predominant perihilar and basilar distribution. CONCLUSION: Myocarditis without pulmonary disease occurred in children in their first decade as a component of MIS-C, a newly described syndrome of multisystemic inflammation requiring further investigation. Pulmonary disease dominated the radiographic features of COVID-19-positive adolescents in their second decade in whom radiographs demonstrated predominantly perihilar and basilar distribution of lung opacities.","Blumfield, Einat; Levin, Terry L",Pediatr Radiol,,571
457897,For the church community after COVID-19,2021,"The transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is the major host protease that enables entry of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into host cells by spike (S) protein priming. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene TMPRSS2 have been associated with susceptibility to and severity of H1N1 or H1N9 influenza A virus infections. Functional variants may influence SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and severity of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well. Therefore, we analyzed the role of SNPs in the gene TMPRSS2 in a German case-control study. We performed genotyping of the SNPs rs2070788, rs383510, and rs12329760 in the gene TMPRSS2 in 239 SARS-CoV-2-positive and 253 SARS-CoV-2-negative patients. We analyzed the association of the SNPs with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2-positive and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients did not differ regarding their demographics. The CC genotype of TMPRSS2 rs383510 was associated with a 1.73-fold increased SARS-CoV-2 infection risk, but was not correlated to severity of COVID-19. Neither TMPRSS2 rs2070788 nor rs12329760 polymorphisms were related to SARS-CoV-2 infection risk or severity of COVID-19. In a multivariable analysis (MVA), the rs383510 CC genotype remained an independent predictor for a 2-fold increased SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. In summary, our report appears to be the first showing that the intron variant rs383510 in the gene TMPRSS2 is associated with an increased risk to SARS-CoV-2 infection in a German cohort.","Schonfelder, K.; Breuckmann, K.; Elsner, C.; Dittmer, U.; Fistera, D.; Herbstreit, F.; Risse, J.; Schmidt, K.; Sutharsan, S.; Taube, C.; Jockel, K.

458267,Covid-19: Self-isolation is the weakest link in stopping transmission,2021,"The world is currently engaged in a race of vaccination versus infection in an effort to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Some countries have already achieved high vaccination rates, offering a glimpse into the so-called ""post-vaccination"" world. We describe here a striking comparison between the similar-sized and neighboring countries of Bahrain and Qatar. While both countries have achieved impressive vaccination rates, cases increased to unprecedented levels in one country while decreasing steadily in the other. Although this could be attributed to a number of factors, we argue here that the heavy reliance on alum-adjuvanted inactivated virus vaccines may have contributed to these discrepant outcomes. We then expand the analysis to compare the outcomes of the top 10 vaccinated countries based on their reliance on inactivated virus vaccines. The results remarkably align with the initial findings seen in Bahrain and Qatar.

458588,COVID-19 in unequally ageing European regions,2020,"INTRODUCTION: In December 2019, cases of pneumonia, a new type of corona virus (SARS-CoV-2), began to be reported in Wuhan, China. We aimed to evaluate changes in sexual behavior of men in the Covid-19 outbreak in Turkey. MATERIAL-METHOD: In our cross-sectional and descriptive study, an online questionnaire evaluating sexual habits during the Covid-19 outbreak was conducted on the men living in the Western Black Sea Region, between 8-25 June 2020. In the questionnaire, questions were asked to evaluate the socio-demographic data of the participants, their comprehensive medical history, their sexual preferences, their family and social life during the Covid-19 outbreak, their concerns about Covid-19, and their changes in their sexual behavior after the Covid-19 outbreak. RESULTS: 536 participants with mean age of 38.6 ± 10.3 years were included in the study. 23.9% (128) respondents stated that they had the fear of transmitting Covid-19 to their partner during sexual intercourse. It was observed that 19.4% (104) of the participants developed a fear of Covid-19 transmission from her sexual partner during the relationship. While the number of weekly sexual intercourse of the participants before the pandemic was 2.34 ± 1.35, this number was found to be 1.54 ± 1.45 during the epidemic period (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The fear of infection and transmission of the disease to the partner that occurs during the Covid-19 pandemic manifests itself in the form of a decrease in the frequency and quality of sexual intercourse.","Baran, Ozer; Aykac, Aykut",Int J Clin Pract,,571

458983,An Analysis on the NASDAQ’s Potential for Sustainable Investment Practices during the Financial Shock from COVID-19,2021,"Previous rat toxicity studies of alpha-glycosyl isoquercitrin (AGIQ), a water-soluble flavonol glycoside derived from rutin, revealed systemic yellow bone discoloration. This investigative study was conducted to determine the AGIQ metabolite(s) responsible for the discoloration. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered dietary AGIQ at doses of 0%, 1.5%, 3.0%, or 5.0% (0, 1735.0, 3480.8, and 5873.7 mg/kg/day, respectively) for 14 days, followed by a 14- or 28-day recovery period. Measurements of quercetin in urine and quercetin, quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, kaempferol, and 3-o-methylquercetin metabolites of AGIQ in bone (femur), white and brown fat, and cerebrum samples were conducted following the exposure period and each recovery period. Gross examination of the femur revealed yellow discoloration that increased in intensity with dose and was still present in a dose-related manner following both recovery periods. Quercetin, at levels correlating with AGIQ dose, was measured in the urine following the 14-day exposure period and, at lower concentrations, 14 or 28 days following cessation of AGIQ exposure. All four metabolites were present in a dose-dependent manner in the femur following 14 days of dietary exposure; only quercetin, quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, and 3-o-methylquercetin were present during the recovery periods. Quercetin, quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, and 3-o-methylquercetin were detected in white fat (along with kaempferol), brown fat (excluding quercetin due to analytical interference), and cerebrum samples, indicating systemic availability of the metabolites. Collectively, these data implicate quercetin, quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, or 3-o-methylquercetin (or a combination thereof) as the most likely metabolite of AGIQ causing the yellow discoloration of bone in rats administered dietary AGIQ.","Davis, Jeffrey P; Koyanagi, Mihoko; Maronpot, Robert R; Recio, Leslie; Hayashi, Shim-Mo",Arch. toxicol,,571

459234,"Hypertension, a Moving Target in COVID-19: Current Views and Perspectives",2021,"During the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the whole world faced an unusual health emergency. Medical care of chronic neurological diseases, such as Epilepsy, is being neglected. In this survey, we aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the care of people with Epilepsy (PwE) and to identify their risk factors for seizure worsening to direct better future medical care. We administered a web-based survey (submitted on August 5, 2020). It included socio-demographic, Epilepsy-related, and psychometric data (The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 Items(DASS21) and The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Regression analysis identified predictors of seizure worsening. We collected responses from an online survey of PwE during the pandemic. Out of 151 responders, 71 patients complained of issues related to Epilepsy management and all of whom reached the treating physician and solved their problems. Sleep quality was compromised in 84 patients (55.6%). Two-thirds of the patients in our cohort (66.2%) reported depression, 72.2% reported anxiety, and 75.5% reported stress. Eight patients (5.3%) got COVID-19 infection, and only one patient suffered from mild worsening of the seizure. The main concerns were shortage of medications for 46 (30.5%) patients, getting Coronavirus infection for 67 (44.4%) patients, and seizure worsening for 32 (21.3%) patients. Thirty-five patients (23.2%) reported seizure worsening, which was best explained by retirement or jobless state, having moderate or severe stress, poor sleep quality, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), fear of getting COVID-19 infection, fear of worsening of seizures, or shortage of medication. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, a significant percentage of PwE experienced worsening of their seizures. This unusual, challenging experience clarifies the urgent need to establish telemedicine services and home-based management of Epilepsy, including ambulatory EEG, home video, and medication delivery to patients' homes to provide continuous medical care.","Abokalawa, Fathi; Ahmad, Samar Farouk; Al-Hashel, Jasem; Hassan, Ahmed Medhat; Arabi, Maher",Acta neurol.

459307,COVID-19-Leitfaden für die Priorisierung von Operationen bei malignen thorakalen Erkrankungen./ [COVID-19 guidelines for the prioritization of operations for malignant thoracic diseases],2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) share similarities in clinical, imaging findings and may present with respiratory distress. Differentiating a new-onset EGPA from COVID-19 during the current pandemic is a diagnostic challenge, particularly if other EGPA symptoms are overlooked. Here in this study we reviewed the literature regarding EGPA patients with COVID-19 and patients who diagnosed with EGPA or suffered an EGPA flare mimicking COVID-19. We conducted a literature survey in PUBMED database using meshed keywords ""COVID-19"" and ""EGPA"", ""COVID-19"" and ""eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis"", ""COVID-19"" and ""Churg Strauss Syndrome"", to reveal previously reported cases involving EGPA patients who had COVID-19 infection, patients who suspected to have COVID-19 but eventually diagnosed with EGPA and patients with a known diagnosis of EGPA who suffered a flare but a COVID-19 infection was suspected initially. A total of 11 cases (6 literature cases, 5 cases from our clinic) were included in our study. Seven (63.6%) of the cases were defined as COVID-19 mimicker and 4 (36.4%) were EGPA with COVID-19. All of the cases in EGPA with COVID-19 group had a history of asthma. All of them had a positive PCR result and ground-glass opacities in thorax CT. In COVID-19 mimicker group, six (85.7%) patients had a history of asthma and other EGPA features that were observed were eosinophilia in 6 (85.7%). Our study provided clues regarding the EGPA/COVID-19 diagnostic challenge which may be useful in the current pandemic. Since none of the findings in COVID-19 are disease-specific, other conditions like EGPA should not be overlooked particularly in PCR negative patients and clinical, laboratory and imaging findings should be interpreted carefully. Furthermore, we did not observe poor outcomes in EGPA patients who had COVID-19.","Özdemir, Bahar; Erden, Abdulsamet; Güven, Serdar Can; Armagan, Berkan; Apaydin, Hakan; Karakas, Özlem; Akdag, Ahmet Gokhan; Ates, Ihsan; Kucuksahin, Orhan; Omma, Ahmet",Rheumatol.Int,,571

459489,On Sparse Ensemble Methods: An Application to Short-Term Predictions of the Evolution of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation is closely associated with the poor prognosis in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients. This study was aimed to determine the role of stimulator of IFN genes (STING), an essential regulator to innate immunity, in the context of SAH. METHODS: A total of 344 male C57BL/6 J mice were subjected to endovascular perforation to develop a model of SAH. Selective STING antagonist C-176 and STING agonist CMA were administered at 30 min or 1 h post-modeling separately. To investigate the underlying mechanism, the AMPK inhibitor compound C was administered intracerebroventricularly at 30 min before surgery. Post-SAH assessments included SAH grade, neurological test, brain water content, western blotting, RT-PCR, and immunofluorescence. Oxygenated hemoglobin was introduced into BV2 cells to establish a SAH model in vitro. RESULTS: STING was mainly distributed in microglia, and microglial STING expression was significantly increased after SAH. Administration of C-176 substantially attenuated SAH-induced brain edema and neuronal injury. More importantly, C-176 significantly alleviated both short-term and persistent neurological dysfunction after SAH. Meanwhile, STING agonist CMA remarkably exacerbated neuronal injury and deteriorated neurological impairments. Mechanically, STING activation aggravated neuroinflammation via promoting microglial activation and polarizing into M1 phenotype, evidenced by microglial morphological changes, as well as the increased level of microglial M1 markers including IL-1ß, iNOS, IL-6, TNF-&#945;, MCP-1, and NLRP3 inflammasome, while C-176 conferred a robust anti-inflammatory effect. However, all the mentioned beneficial effects of C-176 including alleviated neuroinflammation, attenuated neuronal injury and the improved neurological function were reversed by AMPK inhibitor compound C. Meanwhile, the critical role of AMPK signal in C-176 mediated anti-inflammatory effect was also confirmed in vitro. CONCLUSION: Microglial STING yielded neuroinflammation after SAH, while pharmacologic inhibition of STING could attenuate SAH-induced inflammatory injury at least partly by activating AMPK signal. These data supported the notion that STING might be a potential therapeutic target for SAH.","Peng, Yucong; Zhuang, Jianfeng; Ying, Guangyu; Zeng, Hanhai; Zhou, Hang; Cao, Yang; Chen, Huaijun; Xu, Chaoran; Fu, Xiongjie; Xu, Hangzhe; Li, Jianru; Cao, Shenglong; Chen, Jingyin; Gu, Chi; Yan, Feng; Chen, Gao",J Neuroinflammation,,571
459541,Developing a Risk Model for Assessment and Control of the Spread of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: In the midst of the coronavirus disease pandemic, emerging clinical data across the world has equipped frontline health care workers, policy makers, and researchers to better understand and combat the illness. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to report the correlation of clinical and laboratory parameters with patients requiring mechanical ventilation and the mortality in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We did a review of patients with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infection admitted and managed by our institution during the last month. Patients were grouped into intubated and nonintubated, and subgrouped to alive and deceased. A comprehensive analysis using the following parameters were performed: age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, comorbidities, inflammatory markers, laboratory values, cardiac and renal function, electrocardiogram (EKG), chest x-ray findings, temperature, treatment groups, and hospital-acquired patients with SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: A total of 184 patients were included in our study with ages ranging from 28-97 years (mean 64.72 years) and including 73 females (39.67%) and 111 males (60.33%) with a mean BMI of 29.10. We had 114 African Americans (61.96%), 58 Hispanics (31.52%), 11 Asians (5.98%), and 1 Caucasian (0.54%), with a mean of 1.70 comorbidities. Overall, the mortality rate was 17.39% (n=32), 16.30% (n=30) of our patients required mechanical ventilation, and 11.41% (n=21) had hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pertinent and statistically significant results were found in the intubated versus nonintubated patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 for the following parameters: age (P=.01), BMI (P=.07), African American ethnicity (P<.001), Hispanic ethnicity (P=.02), diabetes mellitus (P=.001), creatinine (P=.29), blood urea nitrogen (BUN; P=.001), procalcitonin (P=.03), C-reactive protein (CRP; P=.007), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; P=.001), glucose (P=.01), temperature (P=.004), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates in chest x-rays (P<.001), and bilateral patchy opacity (P=.02). The results between the living and deceased subgroups of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (linking to or against mortality) were BMI (P=.04), length of stay (P<.001), hypertension (P=.02), multiple comorbidity (P=.045), BUN (P=.04), and EKG findings with arrhythmias or blocks (P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: We arrived at the following conclusions based on a comprehensive review of our study group, data collection, and statistical analysis. Parameters that were strongly correlated with the need for mechanical ventilation were younger age group, overweight, Hispanic ethnicity, higher core body temperature, EKG findings with sinus tachycardia, and bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on the chest x-rays. Those intubated exhibited increased disease severity with significantly elevated levels of serum procalcitonin, CRP, LDH, mean glucose, creatinine, and BUN. Mortality was strongly correlated with BMI, African American ethnicity, hypertension, presence of multiple comorbidities (with a mean of 2.32), worsening renal function with acute kidney injury or acute chronic kidney injury, and EKG findings of arrhythmias and heart blocks.","Mani, Vishnu R; Kalabin, Aleksandr; Valdivieso, Sebastian C; Murray-Ramcharan, Max; Donaldson, Brian",J Med Internet Res,,571

Within such a context, interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays a key pathogenic role, thus being a suitable therapeutic target. Indeed, the IL-6-receptor antagonist tocilizumab, already approved for treatment of refractory rheumatoid arthritis, is often used to treat patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms and lung involvement. Therefore, the aim of this review article is to focus on the rationale of tocilizumab utilization in the SARS-CoV-2-triggered cytokine storm, as well as to discuss current evidence and future perspectives, especially with regard to ongoing trials referring to the evaluation of tocilizumab's therapeutic effects in patients with life-threatening SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Pelaia, Corrado; Calabrese, Cecilia; Garofalo, Eugenio; Bruni, Andrea; Vatrella, Alessandro; Pelaia, Girolamo",Int. j. mol. sci.

Moreover, psychopathological implications seem to last also after patients' discharge. Our goal is to investigate the psychological impact and psychopathological outcome of patients affected by COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have engaged 34 patients with COVID-19 conditions [eight of them were healthcare workers patients (HCW)] hospitalized at ""Policlinico Gemelli Foundation"" of Rome, Italy. All patients were evaluated through the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Symptom Checklist 90-R (SCL-90-R) first, during their hospitalization (baseline), and then, after 4 months from hospital discharge (follow-up), through phone interviews. RESULTS: At baseline, 82% of patients revealed from mild to severe psychological impact of COVID-19, according to the IES-R. At follow-up, the mean IES-R total score was significantly decreased (p<0.001) even if almost half (46.6%) of our cohort still showed it. HCW patients showed a significantly higher score than other patients at IES-R scale, both at baseline (p=0.005) and at follow-up (p<0.001). Moreover, at 4 months from discharge, they showed a significantly higher percentage of moderate and severe distress (p=0.015). In addition to this, at follow-up, our cohort of patients showed an increase of anxiety symptoms, even if not significant compared to baseline (46.7% vs. 35.3% respectively; p=1.000), and HCW patients suffered more sleep disorders (p=0.019) and anxiety symptoms (p=0.019) compared to other patients. CONCLUSIONS: We indicate the importance of assessing psychopathology of COVID-19 survivors, monitoring their changes over time, and providing psychological support to improve their psychological well-being.","Chieffo, D P R; Delle Donne, V; Massaroni, V; Mastrilli, L; Belella, D; Monti, L; Silveri, M C; Cauda, R",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,571

OBJECTIVE: To describe typical imaging findings in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, imaging studies and clinical data from children treated for multisystem inflammatory syndrome were collected from multiple centres. Standardised case templates including demographic, biochemical and imaging information were completed by participating centres and reviewed by paediatric radiologists and paediatricians. RESULTS: We included 37 children (21 boys; median age 8.0 years). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 15/37 (41%) children and immunoglobulins in 13/19 children (68%). Common clinical presentations were fever (100%), abdominal pain (68%), rash (54%), conjunctivitis (38%) and cough (32%). Thirty-three children (89%) showed laboratory or imaging findings of cardiac involvement. Thirty of the 37 children (81%) required admission to the intensive care unit, with good recovery in all cases. Chest radiographs demonstrated cardiomegaly in 54% and signs of pulmonary venous hypertension/congestion in 73%. The most common chest CT abnormalities were ground-glass and interstitial opacities (83%), airspace consolidation (58%), pleural effusion (58%) and bronchial wall thickening (42%). Echocardiography revealed impaired cardiac function in half of cases (51%) and coronary artery abnormalities in 14%. Cardiac MRI showed myocardial oedema in 58%, pericardial effusion in 42% and decreased left ventricular function in 25%. Twenty children required imaging for abdominal symptoms, the commonest abnormalities being free fluid (71%) and terminal ileum wall thickening (57%). Twelve children underwent brain imaging, showing abnormalities in two cases. CONCLUSION: Children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome showed pulmonary, cardiac, abdominal and brain imaging findings, reflecting the multisystem inflammatory disease.

We analyzed death and nasopharyngeal viral kinetics in 655 hospitalized patients from the prospective French COVID cohort. The model predicted a median peak viral load that coincided with symptom onset. Patients with age &#8805;65 y had a smaller loss rate of infected cells, leading to a delayed median time to viral clearance occurring 16 d after symptom onset as compared to 13 d in younger patients (P < 10-4). In multivariate analysis, the risk factors associated with mortality were age &#8805;65 y, male gender, and presence of chronic pulmonary disease (hazard ratio [HR] > 2.0). Using a joint model, viral dynamics after hospital admission was an independent predictor of mortality (HR = 1.31, P < 10-3). Finally, we used our model to simulate the effects of effective pharmacological interventions on time to viral clearance and mortality. A treatment able to reduce viral production by 90% upon hospital admission would shorten the time to viral clearance by 2.0 and 2.9 d in patients of age <65 y and &#8805;65 y, respectively. Assuming that the association between viral dynamics and mortality would remain similar to that observed in our population, this could translate into a reduction of mortality from 19 to 14% in patients of age &#8805;65 y with risk factors. Our results show that viral dynamics is associated with mortality in hospitalized patients. Strategies aiming to reduce viral load could have an effect on mortality rate in this population.","Néant, Nadège; Lingas, Guillaume; Le Hingrat, Quentin; Ghosn, Jade; Engelmann, Ilka; Lepiller, Quentin; Gaymard, Alexandre; Ferré, Virginie; Hartard, Cédric; Plantier, Jean-Christophe; Thibault, Vincent; Marlet, Julien; Montes, Brigitte; Bouiller, Kevin; Lescure, François-Xavier; Timsit, Jean-François; Faure, Emmanuel; Poissy, Julien; Chidiac, Christian; Raffi, François; Kimmoun, Antoine; Etienne, Manuel; Richard, Jean-Christophe; Tattevin, Pierre; Garot, Denis; Le Moing, Vincent; Bachelet, Delphine; Tardivon, Coralie; Duval, Xavier; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Mentré, France; Laouénan, Cédric; Visseaux, Benoit; Guedj, Jérémie",Proc.

460413,Throwing Caution to the Wind: COVID-19 and Hurricanes (preprint),2021,"Mitochondria are the largest source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and are intracellular organelles that produce large amounts of the most potent hydroxyl radical (·OH). Molecular hydrogen (H2) can selectively eliminate ·OH generated inside of the mitochondria. Inflammation is induced by the release of proinflammatory cytokines produced by macrophages and neutrophils. However, an uncontrolled or exaggerated response often occurs, resulting in severe inflammation that can lead to acute or chronic inflammatory diseases. Recent studies have reported that ROS activate NLRP3 inflammasomes, and that this stimulation triggers the production of proinflammatory cytokines. It has been shown in literature that H2 can be based on the mechanisms that inhibit mitochondrial ROS. However, the ability for H2 to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation via mitochondrial oxidation is poorly understood. In this review, we hypothesize a possible mechanism by which H2 inhibits mitochondrial oxidation. Medical applications of H2 may solve the problem of many chronic inflammation-based diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Hirano, Shin-Ichi; Ichikawa, Yusuke; Sato, Bunpei; Yamamoto, Haru; Takefuji, Yoshiyasu; Satoh, Fumitake",Int. j. mol. sci.

Existing policies and protocols for donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE) are primarily for institutional settings such as hospitals, not for home visits for patient care. We describe a protocol for donning and doffing PPE in home settings. METHODS: We used an iterative, rapid-prototyping approach to develop the protocol. A small workgroup created preliminary drafts, drawing on hospital-based protocols and modifying them, while undertaking simulations. Wider input was solicited via 2 webinars; 1 regional (Hamilton, Ontario) with palliative clinicians, and 1 national (Canada) with varying professions. We also consulted a group of infectious disease experts. A ""how-to"" video accompanies the protocol. RESULTS: Twelve versions of the protocol were produced, with major changes occurring within the first 6 versions. A national webinar mid-development provided further validation and minor modifications. Subsequent versions involved minor changes. The protocol has 4 phases: (1) Preparing, (2) Entering the Home, (3) Leaving the Home, and (4) After the Visit and Reprocessing. In addition to PPE-related equipment, the protocol requires additional materials including 2 pails for transporting supplies, plastic bags, hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes, and printed easy-to-use checklists. CONCLUSIONS: This protocol addresses gaps in COVID-19-related guidelines, specifically the process of donning and doffing PPE during home visits while supplementing jurisdictional PPE guidelines and protocols.","Kerley, Brian; Tan, Lana; Marshall, Denise; O039,; Neill, Cindy; Bialachowski, Anne; Pereira, José",Ann. fam. med,,571

Some people with disability are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 because they require support for personal care and are unable to physically distance, e.g. those living in congregate settings. Additionally, some people with disability have health conditions that put them at higher risk of poor outcomes if they become infected. Despite this, governments have been slow to recognise, and respond to, the unique and diverse health care needs of people with disability during COVID-19. While some countries, including Australia, have improved access to high-quality health care for people with disability others, like England, have failed to support their citizens with disability. In this Commentary we describe the health care responses of England and Australia and make recommendations for rapidly improving health care for people with disability in the pandemic and beyond.","Kavanagh, Anne; Dickinson, Helen; Carey, Gemma; Llewellyn, Gwynnyth; Emerson, Eric; Disney, George; Hatton, Chris",Disabil Health J,,571

461234,Can COVID-19 Shows Income Inequality?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Point-of-care tests (POCT) are promising tools to detect SARS-CoV-2 in specific settings. Initial reports suggest the ID NOW&#8482; COVID-19 assay (Abbott Diagnostics Inc, USA) is less sensitive than standard real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays. This has raised concern over false negatives in SARS-CoV-2 POCT. OBJECTIVES: We compared the performance of the ID NOW&#8482; COVID-19 assay to our in-house rRT-PCR assay to assess whether dry swabs used in ID NOW&#8482; testing could be stored in transport media and be re-tested by rRT-PCR for redundancy and to provide material for further investigation. METHODS: Paired respiratory swabs collected from patients at three acute care hospitals were used. One swab in transport media (McMaster Molecular Media (MMM)) was tested for SARS-CoV-2 by a laboratory-developed two-target rRT-PCR assay. The second was stored dry in a sterile container and tested by the ID NOW&#8482; COVID-19 assay. Following ID NOW&#8482; testing, dry swabs were stored in MMM for up to 48 h and re-tested by rRT-PCR. Serially diluted SARS-CoV-2 particles were used to assess the impact of heat inactivation and storage time. RESULTS: Respiratory swabs (n = 343) from 179 individuals were included. Using rRT-PCR results as the comparator, the ID NOW&#8482; COVID-19 assay had positive (PPA) and negative (NPA) percent agreements of 87.0% (95% CI:0.74-0.94) and 99.7% (95% CI:0.98-0.99). Re-tested swabs placed in MMM following ID NOW testing had PPA and NPA of 88.8% (95% CI:0.76-0.95) and 99.7% (95% CI:0.98-0.99), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Storing spent dry swabs in transport media for redundancy rRT-PCR testing is a potential approach to address possible false negatives with the ID NOW&#8482; COVID-19 assay.","Burnes, Laura E; Clark, Shawn T; Sheldrake, Elena; Faheem, Amna; Poon, Betty P; Christie-Holmes, Natasha; Finlay, Laura; Kandel, Christopher; Phan, Michael; Frankland, Caylin; Lau, Trevor; Gubbay, Jonathan B; Corbeil, Antoine; Katz, Kevin; Kozak, Robert A",J Clin Virol,,571

OBJECTIVES: To query the international spinal cord medicine community's engagement with and response to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and to assess pandemic-specific information needs and patient concerns. SETTING: An international collaboration of authors and participants. METHODS: Two near-identical surveys (one English and one Spanish language) were distributed via the internet. Responses from those questions shared between the surveys were pooled then analyzed; four questions' responses (those not shared) were analyzed separately. RESULTS: A total of 783 responses were submitted from six continents. Few participants (5.8%) had tested their outpatients with SCI/D for COVID-19; only 4.4% reported having a patient with SCI/D with the virus. Of respondents who worked at an inpatient facility, 53.3% reported that only individuals with symptoms were being screened and 29.9% said that no screening was occurring. Participants relayed several concerns offered by their patients with SCI/D, including vulnerability to infection (76.9%) and fragility of caretaker supply (42%), and those living in countries with guaranteed health care were more likely to report widespread availability of COVID-19 testing than were those living in countries without universal care, &#967;2 (3, N = 625) = 46.259, p < 0.001. CONCLUSION: There is substantial variability in the rehabilitation medicine community in COVID-19 screening practices and availability of screening kits. People living with SCI/D are expressing legitimate and real concerns about their vulnerability to COVID-19. More and rapid work is needed to address these concerns and to standardize best-practice protocols throughout the rehabilitation community.","Stillman, Michael D; Capron, Maclain; Alexander, Marcalee; Di Giusto, Melina Longoni; Scivoletto, Giorgio",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,,571
461600,The eyes of the storm: Spies are on the streets of Uganda making sure everyone abides by Covid-19 rules. They’re spying on political opposition too. A dispatch from Kampala,2020,"BACKGROUND: During a pandemic, it is paramount to understand volume changes in Level I trauma so that with appropriate planning and reallocation of resources, these facilities can maintain and even improve life-saving capabilities Evaluating nonaccidental and accidental trauma can highlight potential areas of improvement in societal behavior and hospital preparedness These critical questions were proposed to better understand how healthcare leaders might adjust surgeon and team coverage of trauma services as well as prepare from a system standpoint what resources will be needed during a pandemic or similar crisis to maintain services QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) How did the total observed number of trauma activations, defined as patients who meet mechanism of injury requirements which trigger the notification and aggregation of the trauma team upon entering the emergency department, change during a pandemic and stay-at-home order? (2) How did the proportion of major mechanisms of traumatic injury change during this time period? (3) How did the proportion and absolute numbers of accidental versus nonaccidental traumatic injury in children and adults change during this time period? METHODS: This was a retrospective study of trauma activations at a Level I trauma center in New Orleans, LA, USA, using trauma registry data of all patients presenting to the trauma center from 2017 to 2020 The number of trauma activations during a government mandated coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) stay-at-home order (from March 20, 2020 to May 14, 2020) was compared with the expected number of activations for the same time period from 2017 to 2019, called ""predicted period"" The expected number (predicted period) was assumed based on the linear trend of trauma activations seen in the prior 3 years (2017 to 2019) for the same date range (March 20, 2020 to May 14, 2020) To define the total number of traumatic injuries, account for proportion changes, and evaluate fluctuation in accidental verses nonaccidental trauma, variables including type of traumatic injury (blunt, penetrating, and thermal), and mechanism of injury (gunshot wound, fall, knife wound, motor vehicle collision, assault, burns) were collected for each patient RESULTS: There were fewer total trauma activations during the stay-at-home period than during the predicted period (372 versus 532 [95% CI 77 to 122];p = 0 016) The proportion of penetrating trauma among total activations was greater during the stay-at-home period than during the predicted period (35% [129 of 372] versus 26% [141 of 532];p = 0 01), while the proportion of blunt trauma was lower during the stay-at-home period than during the predicted period (63 % [236 of 372] versus 71% [376 of 532];p = 0 02) The proportion of gunshot wounds in relation to total activations was greater during the stay-at-home period than expected (26% [97 of 372] versus 18% [96 of 532];p = 0 004) There were fewer motor vehicle collisions in relation to total activations during the stay-at-home period than expected (42% [156 of 372] versus 49% [263 of 532];p = 0 03) Among total trauma activations, the stay-at-home period had a lower proportion of accidental injuries than the predicted period (55% [203 of 372] versus 61% [326 of 532];p = 0 05), and there was a greater proportion of nonaccidental injuries than the predicted period (37% [137 of 372] versus 27% [143 of 532];p &lt; 0 001) In adults, the stay-at-home period had a greater proportion of nonaccidental injuries than the predicted period (38% [123 of 328] versus 26% [123 of 466];p &lt; 0 001) There was no difference between the stay-at-home period and predicted period in nonaccidental and accidental injuries among children CONCLUSIONS: Data from the trauma registry at our region's only Level I trauma center indicate that a stay-at-home order during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a 70% reduction in the number of traumatic injuries, and the types of injuries shifted from more accidental blunt trauma to more nonaccidental penetrating trauma Non-accidental trauma, including gunshot wounds, increased during this period, which suggest community awareness, crisis de-escalation strategies, and programs need to be created to address violence in the community Understanding these changes allows for adjustments in staffing schedules Surgeons and trauma teams could allow for longer shifts between changeover, decreasing viral exposure because the volume of work would be lower Understanding the shift in injury could also lead to a change in specialists covering call With the often limited availability of orthopaedic trauma-trained surgeons who can perform life-saving pelvis and acetabular surgery, this data may be used to mitigate exposure of these surgeons during pandemic situations LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study","Sherman, W.

We identify key intercurrent events that may occur due to COVID-19 in oncology clinical trials with a focus on time-to-event endpoints and discuss considerations pertaining to the other estimand attributes introduced in the ICH E9 addendum. We propose strategies to handle COVID-19 related intercurrent events, depending on their relationship with malignancy and treatment and the interpretability of data after them. We argue that the clinical trial objective from a world without COVID-19 pandemic remains valid. The estimand framework provides a common language to discuss the impact of COVID-19 in a structured and transparent manner.

461936,Analysis of Feature Influence on Covid-19 Death Rate Per Country Using a Novel Orthogonalization Technique,2021,"BACKGROUND: Patients with severe COVID-19 have disorders of the respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, skeletal muscle, and central nervous systems. These systemic failures may be associated with cytokine release syndrome, characterized by hyperpyrexia, thrombocytopenia, hyperferritinemia, and the elevation of other inflammatory markers. Rhabdomyolysis with high fever is a complication that is rarely found in COVID-19. The exact relations of these clinical conditions in patients with COVID-19 remain unknown. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 36-year-old man with severe COVID-19 complicated by rhabdomyolysis and high fever. After admission, his condition continued to deteriorate, with a high body temperature. On day 9, the patient had elevated creatine kinase and myoglobin levels consistent with rhabdomyolysis (26,046 U/L and 3668 ng/mL, respectively). In addition to viral therapy, he was immediately treated with hydration. However, the patient had persistent fever and elevated creatine kinase levels. The patient was diagnosed with malignant hyperthermia as a late complication of COVID-19, although he had no hereditary predisposition to malignant hyperthermia or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The administration of dantrolene with muscle relaxation and anti-inflammatory function showed potential efficacy for rhabdomyolysis, high fever, and increased plasma inflammatory markers. CONCLUSIONS: Malignant hyperthermia is triggered by not only anesthetic agents but also viral infections. A possible mechanism of malignant hyperthermia is hypersensitivity of calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. These include mutations in or the activation of the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor calcium release channel. Dantrolene is a ryanodine receptor antagonist and is used as an anti-inflammatory agent. The administration of dantrolene showed potential efficacy for rhabdomyolysis, high body temperature due to inflammation, and increased inflammatory markers. The underlying mechanism of the association of rhabdomyolysis and high fever in COVID-19 might be similar to the pathogenesis of malignant hyperthermia.","Chiba, Nobutaka; Matsuzaki, Masakazu; Mawatari, Takayuki; Mizuochi, Minori; Sakurai, Atsushi; Kinoshita, Kosaku",Eur J Med Res,,571

METHODOLOGY: Forty-one patients were enrolled in this study from two COVID-19 designated hospitals in Wuhan. Patients underwent chest CT scans for screening and were divided into two groups based on pneumonia-related syndromes. The clinical characteristics and pregnancy outcomes were reviewed and compared. RESULTS: Among the sample of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the third trimester, there was no mortality or severe complications in the mothers nor newborns. Nearly 40% of the patients in the study were asymptomatic. The most common pneumonia-related symptom in symptomatic pregnant patients was cough. Asymptomatic patients had a significantly shorter duration of hospitalisation and a lower rate of positive RT-PCR testing compared with symptomatic patients. There was no statistically significant difference in antibody test results between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients during hospitalisation, while the positive rate of IgM antibody testing was significantly lower in asymptomatic patients during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical manifestation of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were atypical and concealed. Screening of possible COVID-19 patients should be strengthened, through serial or combined testing of laboratory testing or radiological testing, before pregnant women are admitted to hospital.","Luo, Qingqing; Yao, Dujuan; Xia, Lin; Cheng, Yanxiang; Chen, Hui",J Infect Dev Ctries,,571

In particular, chest computed tomography (CT) has a key role in identifying the typical features of the infection. Ground-glass opacities (GGO) are one of the main CT findings, but their presence is not specific for this viral pneumonia. In fact, GGO is a radiological sign of different pathologies with both acute and subacute/chronic clinical manifestations. In the evaluation of a subject with focal or diffuse GGO, the radiologist has to know the patient's medical history to obtain a valid diagnostic hypothesis. The authors describe the various CT appearance of GGO, related to the onset of symptoms, focusing also on the ancillary signs that can help radiologist to obtain a correct and prompt diagnosis.","Cozzi, Diletta; Cavigli, Edoardo; Moroni, Chiara; Smorchkova, Olga; Zantonelli, Giulia; Pradella, Silvia; Miele, Vittorio",Jpn. j. radiol.

A survey-weighted logistic model was conducted to examine the association between sources of COVID-19 information Medicare beneficiaries most relied on (i.e., traditional news sources, social media, comments/guidance from government officials, other webpages/internet, friends/family members, and health care providers) and engaging in all three recommended preventive behaviors (i.e., mask wearing, social distancing, and handwashing). RESULTS: Among study participants, 89.8% engaged in all three recommended preventive behaviors. Approximately 59.3% of beneficiaries reported that they most relied upon traditional news sources for COVID-19 information; 11.4% reported health care providers; 10.6% reported comments/guidance from government officials; 8.8% reported other webpages/internet, 8.6% reported friends/family members; and 1.3% reported they relied upon social media. Beneficiaries who relied on comments/guidance from government officials for COVID-19 information (vs. traditional news sources) were more likely to engage in preventive behaviors (OR=1.68, 95% CI=1.20,2.35). However, those who relied on COVID-19 information from friends/family members (vs. traditional news sources) were less likely to engage in preventive behaviors (OR=0.56, 95% CI=0.44,0.73). DISCUSSION: Our findings can inform decision making about the effective communication sources to reach Medicare beneficiaries for public health messaging regarding preventive measures, including COVID-19 vaccination.","Ng, Boon Peng; Park, Chanhyun",,,571
464984,A predictive model for Covid-19 spread - with application to eight US states and how to end the pandemic,2020,"The replication of SARS-CoV-2 produces two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, that are inactive until cleavage by the viral chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease enzyme (3CL Mpro) into a series of smaller functional proteins. At the heart of 3CL Mpro is an unusual catalytic dyad formed by the side chains of His41 and Cys145 and a coordinated water molecule. The catalytic mechanism by which the enzyme operates is still unknown, as crucial information on the protonation states within the active site is unclear. To experimentally determine the protonation states of the catalytic site and of the other residues in the substrate-binding cavity, and to visualize the hydrogen-bonding networks throughout the enzyme, room-temperature neutron and X-ray data were collected from a large H/D-exchanged crystal of ligand-free (apo) 3CL Mpro.","Kneller, Daniel W; Phillips, Gwyndalyn; Kovalevsky, Andrey; Coates, Leighton",Acta Crystallogr F Struct Biol Commun,,571

465431,The Double Bind of Communicating About Zoonotic Origins: Describing Exotic Animal Sources of COVID-19 Increases Both Healthy and Discriminatory Avoidance Intentions,2021,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the importance of promotion expenditures, direct flights, and climate, among other variables commonly used in gravity models, in the attractiveness of international tourists to an insular destination, in this particular case, Madeira. These three variables are rarely present in gravity models that analyse international demand. Given the possibility of endogeneity, a dynamic model is estimated for the annual panel data set of the 13 main tourist-generating markets for Madeira between 2005 and 2018. The results indicate that traditional gravity variables are significant in explaining international demand. They also show that promotion expenditures, climate, and the number of direct flights are important competitive factors. Promotion expenditures are of fundamental importance given the weight of the tourism sector in insular economic activity. Our results contribute to the debate that has already started about effective tourism policy making and strategies in the post-pandemic of COVID-19.","Cró, Susana Correia Pedro Martins António Miguel",Journal of Vacation Marketing,,571

465550,Bots and nots: Safeguarding online survey research with underrepresented and diverse populations,2021,"Importance: New York State has been an epicenter for both the US coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and HIV/AIDS epidemics. Persons living with diagnosed HIV may be more prone to COVID-19 infection and severe outcomes, yet few studies have assessed this possibility at a population level. Objective: To evaluate the association between HIV diagnosis and COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization, and in-hospital death in New York State. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study, conducted in New York State, including New York City, between March 1 and June 15, 2020, matched data from HIV surveillance, COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed diagnoses, and hospitalization databases to provide a full population-level comparison of COVID-19 outcomes between persons living with diagnosed HIV and persons living without diagnosed HIV. Exposures: Diagnosis of HIV infection through December 31, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization, and in-hospital death. COVID-19 diagnoses, hospitalizations, and in-hospital death rates comparing persons living with diagnosed HIV with persons living without dianosed HIV were computed, with unadjusted rate ratios and indirect standardized rate ratios (sRR), adjusting for sex, age, and region. Adjusted rate ratios (aRRs) for outcomes specific to persons living with diagnosed HIV were assessed by age, sex, region, race/ethnicity, transmission risk, and CD4+ T-cell count-defined HIV disease stage, using Poisson regression models. Results: A total of 2988 persons living with diagnosed HIV (2109 men [70.6%]; 2409 living in New York City [80.6%]; mean [SD] age, 54.0 [13.3] years) received a diagnosis of COVID-19. Of these persons living with diagnosed HIV, 896 were hospitalized and 207 died in the hospital through June 15, 2020. After standardization, persons living with diagnosed HIV and persons living without diagnosed HIV had similar diagnosis rates (sRR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.91-0.97]), but persons living with diagnosed HIV were hospitalized more than persons living without diagnosed HIV, per population (sRR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.29-1.47]) and among those diagnosed (sRR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.37-1.56]). Elevated mortality among persons living with diagnosed HIV was observed per population (sRR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.07-1.40]) and among those diagnosed (sRR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.13-1.48]) but not among those hospitalized (sRR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.83-1.09]). Among persons living with diagnosed HIV, non-Hispanic Black individuals (aRR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.40-1.81]) and Hispanic individuals (aRR, 2.08 [95% CI, 1.83-2.37]) were more likely to receive a diagnosis of COVID-19 than White individuals, but they were not more likely to be hospitalized once they received a diagnosis or to die once hospitalized. Hospitalization risk increased with disease progression to HIV stage 2 (aRR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.11-1.49]) and stage 3 (aRR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.38-2.07]) relative to stage 1. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, persons living with diagnosed HIV experienced poorer COVID-related outcomes relative to persons living without diagnosed HIV; Previous HIV diagnosis was associated with higher rates of severe disease requiring hospitalization, and hospitalization risk increased with progression of HIV disease stage.","Tesoriero, James M; Swain, Carol-Ann E; Pierce, Jennifer L; Zamboni, Lucila; Wu, Meng; Holtgrave, David R; Gonzalez, Charles J; Udo, Tomoko; Morne, Johanne E; Hart-Malloy, Rachel; Rajulu, Deepa T; Leung, Shu-Yin John; Rosenberg, Eli S",JAMA Netw Open,,571
465887,Emergency response strategy for containing COVID-19 within a psychiatric specialty hospital in the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in China,2020,"Although the cancellation of elective procedures due to the COVID-19 outbreak has been a vital precaution, it has resulted in the suspension of aesthetic procedures and surgeries worldwide. Consequently, this postponement and other factors might have a negative impact on patients planning to undergo aesthetic procedures. Understanding the changes in patient motivation and perception in comparison to the prepandemic period is imperative for proper adjustment of plastic surgery clinics.A prospective questionnaire study was conducted on patients with cancelled aesthetic surgeries or procedures to determine the effects that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had on patient motivation regarding cosmetic surgery and procedures and to establish a relationship between patient characteristics and the overall effect of pandemia on the perception of cosmetic surgery.Although most patients felt angry or frustrated due to the cancellation of their surgeries or procedures, the majority accepted that it was a necessary precaution. Patients with a history of previous minimally invasive procedures had a significantly higher ratio of acceptance for cancellations, whereas single patients were more likely to want to have their treatments done if the decision were left up to them. A subset of patients considered undergoing additional cosmetic procedures in the setting of self-isolation, and all patients stated that they would reschedule once the pandemia was under control.Patients with established motivation for plastic surgery and minimally invasive procedures ultimately plan to resume their normal treatments alongside others after the pandemia subsides. Plastic surgeons must actively communicate with their patient population during this time to properly educate, embrace, and direct them under scientific guidelines.","Sezgin, Billur; Tatar, Sedat; Kara, Basak Selin; Ozmen, Selahattin; Yavuzer, Reha",Facial plast. surg,,571

The various forms of PPE that are both available and appropriate are addressed. There are options in the form of eyewear, gloves, masks, respirators, and gowns. The logical and practical utilization of these should be data driven and evolve based on both experience and data. Last, situations specific to surgical populations are addressed.

467529,Genomics-Informed Responses in the Elimination of COVID-19 in Australia (preprint),2021,"Twenty-five years since the Fourth World Conference on Women, as a result of feminist organising and activism, there has been substantial law reform and transformation in South Africa. Yet, as for many countries in southern Africa, we have yet to see full implementation and universal access to services for girls and women. This article in offering reflections from the past 25 years, notes how the new democratic government set about replacing the apartheid policy of population control after 1994. It is argued that despite progress, population control remains embedded within programming for sexual and reproductive health and rights in South Africa. The contextual barriers represented by the gender effects of the HIV epidemic for women, government denialism and poor financing as well as navigation of donor practices are inextricably entwined with the realisation of sexual and reproductive health and rights over this period. What is of concern is the influence and dependence on international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and donors in policy, programming and implementation, particularly against the history of 'Gag laws' imposed by conservative governments, effectively rolling back reproductive services and therefore rights. Two related reproductive health indicators, contraception and abortion, are tracked noting how these have been framed, programmed, developed and also changed over the past quarter of a century in South Africa. Within a human rights perspective together with a social justice rubric, narrating the key struggles for reproductive justice provides an opportunity to review sexuality and reproduction from the individual to a wider context, locating struggles and challenges within families, communities and society. While there have been substantial changes and reforms over this time systemic injustices persist. These remain racialised with black and poor women bearing the brunt of high rates of maternal morbidity and mortality, even more so during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Stevens, M.",Agenda-Empowering Women for Gender Equity,,571

467764,Association between risk of venous thromboembolism and mortality in patients with COVID-19,2021,"The sediment record from Lake Ohrid (Southwestern Balkans) represents the longest continuous lake archive in Europe, extending back to 1.36 Ma. We reconstruct the vegetation history based on pollen analysis of the DEEP core to reveal changes in vegetation cover and forest diversity during glacial-interglacial (G-IG) cycles and early basin development. The earliest lake phase saw a significantly different composition rich in relict tree taxa and few herbs. Subsequent establishment of a permanent steppic herb association around 1.2 Ma implies a threshold response to changes in moisture availability and temperature and gradual adjustment of the basin morphology. A change in the character of G-IG cycles during the Early-Middle Pleistocene Transition is reflected in the record by reorganization of the vegetation from obliquity- to eccentricity-paced cycles. Based on a quantitative analysis of tree taxa richness, the first large-scale decline in tree diversity occurred around 0.94 Ma. Subsequent variations in tree richness were largely driven by the amplitude and duration of G-IG cycles. Significant tree richness declines occurred in periods with abundant dry herb associations, pointing to aridity affecting tree population survival. Assessment of long-term legacy effects between global climate and regional vegetation change reveals a significant influence of cool interglacial conditions on subsequent glacial vegetation composition and diversity. This effect is contrary to observations at high latitudes, where glacial intensity is known to control subsequent interglacial vegetation, and the evidence demonstrates that the Lake Ohrid catchment functioned as a refugium for both thermophilous and temperate tree species.","Donders, Timme; Panagiotopoulos, Konstantinos; Koutsodendris, Andreas; Bertini, Adele; Mercuri, Anna Maria; Masi, Alessia; Combourieu-Nebout, Nathalie; Joannin, Sébastien; Kouli, Katerina; Kousis, Ilias; Peyron, Odile; Torri, Paola; Florenzano, Assunta; Francke, Alexander; Wagner, Bernd; Sadori, Laura",Proc.

The sudden surge in the number of cases is overwhelming the capacity of the national healthcare system, particularly in developing countries. Central to the containment of the ongoing pandemic is the availability of rapid and accurate diagnostic tests that could pinpoint patients at early disease stages. In the current study, we aimed to (1) Evaluate the diagnostic performance of the rapid antigen test (RAT) ""Standard&#8482; Q COVID-19 Ag"" against reverse transcriptase quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) in eighty-three swabs collected from COVID-19 suspected individuals showing various demographic features, clinical and radiological findings. (2) Test whether measuring laboratory parameters in participant's blood would enhance the predictive accuracy of RAT. (3) Identify the most important features that determine the results of both RAT and RT-qPCR. METHODS: Diagnostic measurements (e.g. sensitivity, specificity, etc.) and receiver operating characteristic curve were used to assess the clinical performance of ""Standard&#8482; Q COVID-19 Ag"". We used the support vector machine (SVM) model to investigate whether measuring laboratory indices would enhance the accuracy of RAT. Moreover, a random forest classification model was used to determine the most important determinants of the results of RAT and RT-qPCR for COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of RAT were 78.2, 64.2, and 75.9%, respectively. Samples with high viral load and those that were collected within one-week post-symptoms showed the highest sensitivity and accuracy. The SVM modeling showed that measuring laboratory indices did not enhance the predictive accuracy of RAT. CONCLUSION: ""Standard&#8482; Q COVID-19 Ag"" should not be used alone for COVID-19 diagnosis due to its low diagnostic performance relative to the RT-qPCR.

Headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) technique was used for the extraction and concentration of volatile compounds and the analysis was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). RESULTS: Alcohols were the volatile compounds most abundantly isolated in the headspace of pumpkin purée (control and processed purées had ranges between 43-56%), followed by aldehydes (14-28%), hydrocarbons (8-13%) and terpenes (7-10%). Lipid oxidation, Maillard reaction and carotenoids degradation were the main chemical routes of formation of volatile compounds after HPT processing. Initial temperature or pressure intensity of HPT processing, within the ranges tested in this study, did not affect the initial levels of volatile compounds of pumpkin purée.

This column offers preliminary data from an ongoing experience sampling study of the prevalence, course, and impact of loneliness on mental health in a community adult sample living under social distancing requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic. Initial findings aggregated across all experience sampling reports showed negative associations between virtual social contact (via text, phone, or videoconferencing) and feelings of loneliness, while in-person interactions appeared to have no impact on loneliness. In addition, respondents reported frequent instances of negative effects on physical and mental health, including disruptions in sleep and recurring suicidal ideation. While further analyses are needed, these findings are consistent with similar emerging reports showing increased rates of mental health concerns during periods of social distancing. Possible avenues for addressing these concerns using remote interventions are explored.","Lewis, Katie",J Psychiatr Pract,,571
468305,COVID-19 in Italy: did the virus run on an ancient Roman road?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Few ICU staffing studies examine collaboration structures among healthcare workers. Knowledge about how healthcare workers (HWs) are connected to care for critically ill COVID-19 (C19) patients provides evidence for characterizing the relationship between team structures, care quality, and patient safety. OBJECTIVE: To discover the distinctions of teamwork structures in C19 critical care by comparing HW collaboration associated with the management of critically ill patients with and without C19. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we apply network analysis to the utilization of electronic health records (EHRs) of 76 critically ill patients (38 with and 38 without C19) admitted to a large academic medical center to learn HW collaboration. We use the EHRs for adult patients admitted to the C19 ICU at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Nashville, Tennessee, USA) between March 17, 2020 and May 31, 2020. We matched each C19 patient on age, gender, and length of stay, with NC19 patients admitted to the Medical ICU (MICU) between December 1, 2019 and February 29, 2020. Then we use two sociometric measurements, including eigencentrality and betweenness, to quantify HWs' status in the networks. Eigencentrality characterizes the degree to which an HW is likely to be a core person in the collaboration. Betweenness centrality refers to whether an HW lies on the path of others who are not directly connected, which is leveraged to characterize the broad skillsets of an HW. We further measure patient staffing intensity in terms of the number of HWs interacting with the EHR of a patient. We assess the extent to which the core and betweenness status of HWs, as well as patient staffing intensity, in C19 and Non-C19 (NC19) critical care are statistically different using Mann-Whitney U tests at the 95% confidence level. RESULTS: HWs are likely to more frequently work with each other in C19 than NC19 critical care (median eigencentrality values of 0.096 vs. 0.057, respectively; p = 1.5×10e-9). Internal medicine physicians exhibit a higher core status in the C19 critical care than NC19 (p = 1.2 ×10e-3). Nurse practitioners exhibit a more betweenness status in the C19 than NC19 care (p = 3.10 ×10e-4). In comparison to the NC19 setting, the EHRs of C19 critically ill patients were utilized by a larger number of internal medicine nurse practitioners (p = 1.27 ×10e-5), cardiovascular nurses (p = 8.48 ×10e-6) and surgical ICU nurses (p = 1.62 ×10e-3), as well as a smaller number of resident physicians (p = 5.96 ×10e-4). CONCLUSIONS: Network analysis methodologies and EHR utilization data provide a novel way to learn distinctions of collaboration structures in C19 critical care, which can be leveraged by healthcare organizations to understand the novel additions the C19 brings to the collaboration structure in urgent care.","Yan, Chao; Zhang, Xinmeng; Gao, Cheng; Wilfon, Erin; Casey, Jonathan; France, Danniel; Gong, Yang; Patel, Mayur; Malin, Bradley; Chen, You",,,571

(preprint),2021,"BACKGROUND: Susceptibility to Covid-19 has been found to be associated with the ABO blood group, with O type individuals being at a lower risk. However, the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. Here, we aimed to test the hypothesis that Covid-19 patients might have lower levels of ABO antibodies than non-infected individuals as they could offer some degree of protection. METHODS: After showing that the viral spike protein harbors the ABO glycan epitopes when produced by cells expressing the relevant glycosyltransferases, like upper respiratory tract epithelial cells, we enrolled 290 patients with Covid-19 and 276 asymptomatic controls to compare their levels of natural ABO blood group antibodies. RESULTS: We found significantly lower IgM anti-A + anti-B agglutination scores in blood group O patients (76.93 vs 88.29, P-value = 0.034) and lower levels of anti-B (24.93 vs 30.40, P-value = 0.028) and anti-A antibodies (28.56 vs 36.50, P-value = 0.048) in blood group A and blood group B patients, respectively, compared to controls. CONCLUSION: In this study, we showed that ABO antibody levels are significantly lower in Covid-19 patients compared to controls. These findings could indicate that patients with low levels of ABO antibodies are at higher risk of being infected.","Deleers, Marie; Breiman, Adrien; Daubie, Valéry; Maggetto, Carine; Barreau, Isabelle; Besse, Tatiana; Clémenceau, Béatrice; Ruvoën-Clouet, Nathalie; Fils, Jean-François; Maillart, Evelyne; Doyen, Virginie; Mahadeb, Bhavna; Jani, Jacques C; Van der Linden, Philippe; Cannie, Mieke M; Hayef, Nabil; Corazza, Francis; Le Pendu, Jacques; El Kenz, Hanane",Int J Infect Dis,,571

This disease has a mortality rate of about 3·7 percent, and successful therapy is desperately needed to combat it. The exact cellular mechanisms of COVID-19 need to be illustrated in detail. This study aimed to evaluate serum cytokines in COVID-19 patients. In this study, serum was collected from volunteer individuals, moderate COVID-19 patients, severe cases of COVID-19 patients, and patients who recovered from COVID-19 (n = 122). The serum concentrations of interleukins such as IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;), were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The concentrations of IL-1 and TNF-&#945; were did not differ significantly among groups. However, the concentration of IL-6 was significantly higher in moderate COVID-19 and severe cases of COVID-19 groups compared to control and recovered groups indicating it to be an independent predictor in the coronavirus disease. The levels of IFN-Î³ and IL-4 were significantly lower in the recovery group than the severe case of the COVID-19 group. In contrast, the level of IL-10 in recovered COVID-19 patients was significantly higher in compare to severe cases, COVID-19 patients. Varying levels of cytokines were detected in COVID-19 group than control group suggesting distinct immunoregulatory mechanisms involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis.

METHODS: YouTube was searched using the terms '2019 novel coronavirus', 'Wuhan virus' and '' (Mandarin for Wuhan virus) on 1st and 2nd February 2020. First 50 videos in each group were analyzed. Videos in other languages, duplicate videos, those without an audio and duration >15 min were excluded .72 videos in English and 42 in Mandarin were reviewed. 2 reviewers classified the videos as useful, misleading or news based on pre specified criterion. Inter-observer agreement was evaluated with kappa coefficient. Modified DISCERN index for reliability and medical information and content index (MICI) score were used for content analysis. RESULTS: These videos attracted cumulative 21,288,856 views. 67% of English and 50% Mandarin videos had useful information. The viewership of misleading Mandarin videos was higher than the useful ones. WHO accounted for only 4% of useful videos. Mean DISCERN score for reliability was 3.12/5 and 3.25/5 for English and Mandarin videos respectively. Mean cumulative MICI score of useful videos was low (6.71/25 for English and 6.28/25 for Mandarin). CONCLUSIONS: YouTube viewership during 2019 n-CoV outbreak is higher than previous outbreaks. The medical content of videos is suboptimal International health agencies are underrepresented. Given its popularity, YouTube should be considered as important platform for information dissemination.","Khatri, Priyanka; Singh, Shweta R; Belani, Neeta Kesu; Yeong, Yin Leng; Lohan, Rahul; Lim, Yee Wei; Teo, Winnie Zy",Travel Med Infect Dis,,571

The goal of PhenX is to facilitate the use of standard measures, enhance data interoperability, and promote collaborative and translational research. PhenX is driven by the scientific community and historically has depended on working groups of experts to recommend measures for release in the PhenX Toolkit. The urgent need for recommended, standard measures for COVID-19 research triggered the development of a ""rapid release"" process for releasing new content in the PhenX Toolkit. Initially, PhenX collaborated with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, the National Human Genome Research Institute, and the NIH Disaster Research Response (DR2) program to create a library of COVID-19 measurement protocols. With additional support from NIH, PhenX adapted crowdsourcing techniques to accelerate prioritization and recommendation of protocols for release in the PhenX Toolkit. Prioritized COVID-19-specific protocols were used to anchor and define specialty collections of protocols that were subject to review and approval by the PhenX Steering Committee. In addition to the COVID-19-specific protocols, the specialty collections include existing, well-established PhenX protocols, use of which will further enhance data interoperability and cross-study analysis. The COVID-19 specialty collections are Behaviors and Risks; Ethnicity, Race and Demographics; History, Treatment and Outcomes; Information Resources; Psychosocial and Mental Health; and Socioeconomic.

A best evidence review,2020,"Concerns have been raised regarding the safety of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), based on the hypothesis that such medications may raise expression of ACE2, the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We conducted a literature review of studies (n = 12) in experimental animals and human subjects (n = 12) and evaluated the evidence regarding the impact of administration of ACEIs and ARBs on ACE2 expression. We prioritized studies that assessed ACE2 protein expression data, measured directly or inferred from ACE2 activity assays. The findings in animals are inconsistent with respect to an increase in ACE2 expression in response to treatment with ACEIs or ARBs. Control/sham animals show little to no effect in the plurality of studies. Those studies that report increases in ACE2 expression tend to involve acute injury models and/or higher doses of ACEIs or ARBs than are typically administered to patients. Data from human studies overwhelmingly imply that administration of ACEIs/ARBs does not increase ACE2 expression. Available evidence, in particular, data from human studies, does not support the hypothesis that ACEI/ARB use increases ACE2 expression and the risk of complications from COVID-19. We conclude that patients being treated with ACEIs and ARBs should continue their use for approved indications.","Sriram, Krishna; Insel, Paul A",Clin Pharmacol Ther,,571

The Delta variant increases the reproduction number by a factor of 2.17 [CI 95%: 1.99, 2.36] relative to the Alpha variant and a factor of 3.28 [CI 95%: 3.01, 3.58] relative to the ancestral variant. Forecasting the proportion of an emerging virus variant is straight forward and we proceed to show how the effective reproduction number for the new variant can be estimated without contemporary sequencing results.

472108,Cancer in times of COVID-19: repercussions in the lives of women undergoing oncological treatment,2020,"BackgroundPatients admitted to the emergency department (ED) with COVID-19 symptoms are routinely required to have chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. COVID-19 infection has been directly related to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe infections lead to admission to intensive care and can also lead to death. The use of clinical data in machine learning models available at time of admission to ED can be used to assess possible risk of ARDS, need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission as well as risk of mortality. In addition, chest radiographs can be inputted into a deep learning model to further assess these risks. PurposeThis research aimed to develop machine and deep learning models using both structured clinical data and image data from the electronic health record (EHR) to adverse outcomes following ED admission. Materials and MethodsLight Gradient Boosting Machines (LightGBM) was used as the main machine learning algorithm using all clinical data including 42 variables. Compact models were also developed using 15 the most important variables to increase applicability of the models in clinical settings. To predict risk of the aforementioned health outcome events, transfer learning from the CheXNet model was implemented on our data as well. This research utilized clinical data and chest radiographs of 3571 patients 18 years and older admitted to the emergency department between 9th March 2020 and 29th October 2020 at Loyola University Medical Center. Main FindingsOur research results show that we can detect COVID-19 infection (AUC = 0.790 (0.746-0.835)) and predict the risk of developing ARDS (AUC = 0.781 (0.690-0.872), ICU admission (AUC = 0.675 (0.620-0.713)), and mortality (AUC = 0.759 (0.678-0.840)) at moderate accuracy from both chest X-ray images and clinical data. Principal ConclusionsThe results can help in clinical decision making, especially when addressing ARDS and mortality, during the assessment of patients admitted to the ED with or without COVID-19 symptoms.","Butler, Liam; Karabayir, Ibrahim; Tootooni, Mohammad Samie; Afshar, Majid; Goldberg, Ari; Akbilgic, Oguz",,,571

However, the recent reports about persistent shedding of viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in the human feces have created a possibility to track the prevalence and trends of the disease in communities, known as wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). In this article, we highlight the current limitations and future prospects for WBE to manage pandemics.","Bhattacharya, Prosun; Kumar, Manish; Islam, Md Tahmidul; Haque, Rehnuma; Chakraborty, Sudip; Ahmad, Arslan; Niazi, Nabeel Khan; Cetecioglu, Zeynep; Nilsson, David; Ijumulana, Julian; van der Voorn, Tom; Jakariya, Md; Hossain, Maqsud; Ahmed, Firoz; Rahman, Mahbubur; Akter, Nargis; Johnston, Dara; Ahmed, Kazi Matin",Curr Pollut Rep,,571

473021,Comparison of supportive regulatory measures for pediatric medical device development in Japan and the United States,2020,"While an appropriately regulated production of interferons (IFNs) performs a fundamental role in the defense against coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), dysregulated overproduction of inflammatory mediators can play an important role in the development of SARS-CoV-2 infection-related complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. As the principal constituents of innate immunity, both type I and III IFNs share antiviral features. However, important properties, including preferential expression at mucosal barriers (such as respiratory tract), local influences, lower receptor distribution, smaller target cell types, noninflammatory effects, and immunomodulatory impacts, were attributed only to type III IFNs. Accordingly, type III IFNs can establish an optimal effective antiviral response, without triggering exaggerated systemic inflammation that is generally attributed to the type I IFNs. However, some harmful effects were attributed to the III IFNs and there are also major differences between human and mouse concerning the immunomodulatory effects of III IFNs. Here, we describe the differential properties of type I and type III IFNs and present a model of IFN response during SARS-COV-2 infection, while highlighting the superior potential of type III IFNs in COVID-19.","Jafarzadeh, Abdollah; Nemati, Maryam; Saha, Bhaskar; Bansode, Yashwant D; Jafarzadeh, Sara",Viral immunol,,571

Objective: To advocate the necessary adaptations in radio surgical practices to effectively manage the radio surgical patients, resource utilization, and protecting the healthcare provider during the COVID pandemic. Material and Methods: In addition to the literature review, pertinent recommendations are made in respect to the gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS). Results: Every patient presenting to GKRS treatment should be considered as a potential asymptomatic COVID carrier. Patients should be categorized based on the priority (urgent, semi-urgent, or elective) on the basis of pathological and clinical status. The only urgent indication is a non-responding or enlarging cerebral metastasis. There is a high risk of aerosol dispersion during gamma radiation delivery in the gamma gantry. Conclusion: These recommendations should be used to minimize the chances of pathogenic exposure to the patient and caregivers both.","Tripathi, Manjul; Deora, Harsh; Sadashiva, Nishanth; Batish, Aman; Mohindra, Sandeep; Gupta, Sunil K",Neurol India,,571

Especially in dentistry, there is a growing concern due to it's high virulence and routes of transmission through saliva aerosols. The virus keeps viable on air for at least 3 hours and on plastic and stainless-steel surfaces up to 72 hours. In this sense, dental offices, both in the public and private sectors, are high-risk settings of cross infection among patients, dentists and health professionals in the clinical environment (including hospital's intensive dental care facilities). This manuscript aims to compile current available evidence on prevention strategies for dental professionals. Besides, we briefly describe promising treatment strategies recognized until this moment. The purpose is to clarify dental practitioners about the virus history and microbiology, besides guiding on how to proceed during emergency consultations based on international documents. Dentists should consider that a substantial number of individuals (including children) who do not show any signs and symptoms of COVID-19 may be infected and can disseminate the virus. Currently, there is no effective treatment and fast diagnosis is still a challenge. All elective dental treatments and non-essential procedures should be postponed, keeping only urgent and emergency visits to the dental office. The use of teledentistry (phone calls, text messages) is a very promising tool to keep contact with the patient without being at risk of infection.","Pereira, Luciano José; Pereira, Cassio Vicente; Murata, Ramiro Mendonça; Pardi, Vanessa; Pereira-Dourado, Stela Márcia",Braz Oral Res,,571

To release social panic and guide future schedules, this article proposes a novel mathematical model, the Delay Differential Epidemic Analyzer (D2EA), to analyze the dynamics of epidemic and forecast its future trends. Based on the traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, the D2EA model innovatively introduces a set of quarantine states and applies both ordinary differential equations and delay differential equations to describe the transition between two states. Potential variations of practical factors are further considered to reveal the true epidemic picture. In the experiment part, we use the D2EA model to simulate the epidemic in Hubei Province. Fitting to the collected real data as non-linear optimization, the D2EA model forecasts that the accumulated confirmed infected cases in Hubei Province will reach the peak at the end of February and then steady down. We also evaluate the effectiveness of the quarantine measures and schedule the date to reopen Hubei Province.","Liu, Chenzhengyi; Zhao, Jingwei; Liu, Guohang; Gao, Yuanning; Gao, Xiaofeng",J.

Therefore, it will be helpful to predict the tendency of the epidemic and analyze the influence of official policies. Existing models for prediction, such as cabin models and individual-based models, are either oversimplified or too meticulous, and the influence of the epidemic was studied much more than that of official policies. To predict the epidemic tendency, we consider four groups of people, and establish a propagation dynamics model. We also create a negative feedback to quantify the public vigilance to the epidemic. We evaluate the tendency of epidemic in Hubei and China except Hubei separately to predict the situation of the whole country. Experiments show that the epidemic will terminate around 17 March 2020 and the final number of cumulative infections will be about 78 191 (prediction interval, 74 872 to 82 474). By changing the parameters of the model accordingly, we demonstrate the control effect of the policies of the government on the epidemic situation, which can reduce about 68% possible infections. At the same time, we use the capital asset pricing model with dummy variable to evaluate the effects of the epidemic and official policies on the revenue of multiple industries.","Zhou, Lingyun; Wu, Kaiwei; Liu, Hanzhi; Gao, Yuanning; Gao, Xiaofeng",J.

478247,Covid-19 and the European Convention on Human Rights,2020,"COVID-2019 pandemic is affecting people worldwide in the absence of an effective treatment strategy. Several suggestive therapeutic options through drug repurposing are recommended, but a complete consensus is not reached. A combination of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Azithromycin (AZM) has been widely tried and discussed but its administration has also led to potential adversities in patients. Studies are suggesting that most prominent adverse event with HCQ and AZM combination is QT interval prolongation. We studied interaction of HCQ with AZM and subsequent effect of this drug combination on QT interval prolongation. We performed system biological investigation of HCQ and AZM targets and screened important targets and pathways possibly involved in QT interval prolongation. The best core hub protein drug targets involved in QT interval prolongation were identified as HSP90AA1 exclusively associated with HCQ, while AKT1 exclusively associated with AZM on the basis of node degree value. It was found that PI3K/Akt, VEGF, ERBB2 pathways must be given consideration for understanding the role of HCQ and AZM in QT interval prolongation. Conclusion: Computational methods have certain limitations based on source database coverage and prediction algorithms and therefore this data needs experimental correlation to draw final conclusion, but current findings screen targets for QT interval prolongation associated with HCQ and AZM. These proteins and pathways may provide ways to reduce this major risk associated with this combination.","Khan, Abdul Arif; Khan, Zakir",Chem Biol Interact,,571

We provide an extensive evaluation of this fully automated assay on Cobas e801/e602 immunoassay analyzers. METHODS: We assessed the linearity, precision, and throughput of the Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay. Sensitivity was calculated from 349 SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive samples; specificity was determined from 715 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-naive samples. We examined cross-reactivity against other antibody positive samples [syphilis, rheumatoid factor (RF), antinuclear antibody (ANA), double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA), influenza, dengue, hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV)] and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 kinetics. RESULTS: The assay cut-off index (COI) was linear up to 90.8. The interassay precision was 2.9% for a negative control (COI = 0.1) and 5.1% for a positive control (COI = 3.0). Assay time is 18 min and results are available 1 min later; throughput for 300 samples was 76 min. Only 1 case positive for HBsAg tested falsely positive; specificity was 99.9%. The assay has a sensitivity of 97.1% 14 days after PCR positivity (POS) and 100% at &#8805;21 days POS; 48.2% of cases had anti-SARS-CoV-2 within 6 days POS. In 11 patients in whom serum was available prior to a positive antibody signal (COI &#8805;1.0) the interval between the last negative and first positive COI (time to ""seroconversion"") on average is 3 days (range 1-6 days) and 4 more days (range 1-7) for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 to plateau. CONCLUSION: The Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay shows excellent performance with minimal cross-reactivity from other viral and confounding antibodies. Antibody development and seroconversion appears quite early.","Lau, C S; Hoo, S P; Yew, S F; Ong, S K; Lum, L T; Heng, P Y; Tan, J G; Wong, M S; Aw, T C",J Appl Lab Med,,571

As a model system, we used the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein (48 kDa) due to its stability and important role in therapeutic development. Cryo-EM structures of the N protein monomer revealed a flexible N-terminal ""top hat"" motif and a helical-rich C-terminal domain. To complement our structural findings, we engineered microchip-based immunoprecipitation assays that led to the discovery of the first antibody binding site on the N protein. The data also facilitated molecular modeling of a variety of pandemic and common cold-related coronavirus proteins. Such insights may guide future pandemic-preparedness protocols through immuno-engineering strategies to mitigate viral outbreaks.","Casasanta, Michael A; Jonaid, G M; Kaylor, Liam; Luqiu, William Y; Solares, Maria J; Schroen, Mariah L; Dearnaley, William J; Wilson, Jarad; Dukes, Madeline J; Kelly, Deborah F",Nanoscale,,571

The factors that influence the implementation and use of telehealth in critical access hospitals are in need of exploration. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to understand the factors that influenced telehealth uptake and use in a set of frontier critical access hospitals in the United States. METHODS: This work was conducted as part of a larger evaluation of a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services-funded demonstration program to expand cost-based reimbursement for services for Medicare beneficiaries for frontier critical access hospitals. Our sample was 8 critical access hospitals in Montana, Nevada, and North Dakota that implemented the telehealth aspect of that demonstration. We reviewed applications and progress reports for the demonstration program and conducted in-person site visits. We used a semistructured discussion guide to facilitate conversations with clinical, administrative, and information technology staff. Using NVivo software (QSR International), we coded the notes from the interviews and then analyzed the themes. RESULTS: Several factors influenced the implementation and use of telehealth in critical access hospitals, including making changes to workflow and infrastructure as well as practitioner acceptance and availability. Participants also cited technical assistance and support for implementation as supportive factors. CONCLUSIONS: Frontier critical access hospitals may adopt telehealth to overcome challenges such as distance from specialty practitioners and workforce challenges. Telehealth can be used for provider-to-patient and provider-to-provider interactions to improve access to care, remove barriers, and improve quality. However, the ability of telehealth to improve outcomes is limited by factors such as workflow and infrastructure changes, practitioner acceptance and availability, and financing.","Haque, Saira Naim; DeStefano, Sydney; Banger, Alison; Rutledge, Regina; Romaire, Melissa",JMIR Form Res,,571

Disease-related malnutrition is associated with impaired respiratory function and increased all-cause morbidity and mortality. Patients with COVID-19 infection carry a high nutritional risk. After designing a specific nutritional support protocol for this disease, we carried out a retrospective study on malnutrition and on the use of nutritional support in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study to determine whether nutritional support positively affected hospital stay, clinical complications, and mortality in patients with COVID-19. We compared the results with those of standard nutritional management. Our secondary objectives were to determine the prevalence of malnutrition in patients with COVID-19 and the value of nutritional support in the hospital where the study was performed. RESULTS: At least 60% of patients with COVID-19 experience malnutrition (up to 78.66% presented at least 1 of the parameters studied). The specialized nutritional support protocol was indicated in only 21 patients (28%) and was started early in only 12 patients (16%). Hospital stay was significantly shorter in patients managed with the early protocol (5.09 days, 95% CI, 1.338-8.853, p<0.01). Similarly, in this group, respiratory distress was less severe and less frequent (41% vs 82.5%, p<0.007), and statistically significantly fewer complications were recorded (9/12 vs 91/63; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with high rates of disease-related malnutrition. Early implementation of a specialized nutritional support plan can improve the prognosis of these patients by reducing hospital stay, the possibility of more severe respiratory distress, and complications in general.","Morán-López, Jesús Manuel",Endocrinol. diabetes nutr.

Clinical factors and laboratory assays to streamline plasma donor selection, and the durability of nAb responses, are incompletely understood.METHODSPotential convalescent plasma donors with virologically documented SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested for serum IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 domain and against nucleoprotein (NP), and for nAb.RESULTSAmong 250 consecutive persons, including 27 (11%) requiring hospitalization, who were studied a median of 67 days since symptom onset, 97% were seropositive on 1 or more assays. Sixty percent of donors had nAb titers &#8805;1:80. Correlates of higher nAb titers included older age (adjusted OR [AOR] 1.03 per year of age, 95% CI 1.00-1.06), male sex (AOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.13-3.82), fever during illness (AOR 2.73, 95% CI 1.25-5.97), and disease severity represented by hospitalization (AOR 6.59, 95% CI 1.32-32.96). Receiver operating characteristic analyses of anti-S1 and anti-NP antibody results yielded cutoffs that corresponded well with nAb titers, with the anti-S1 assay being slightly more predictive. nAb titers declined in 37 of 41 paired specimens collected a median of 98 days (range 77-120) apart (P < 0.001). Seven individuals (2.8%) were persistently seronegative and lacked T cell responses.CONCLUSIONnAb titers correlated with COVID-19 severity, age, and sex. SARS-CoV-2 IgG results can serve as useful surrogates for nAb testing. Functional nAb levels declined, and a small proportion of convalescent individuals lacked adaptive immune responses.FUNDINGThe project was supported by the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research with support from the NIAID under contract number 75N91019D00024, and was supported by the Fred Hutchinson Joel Meyers Endowment, Fast-Grants, a New Investigator award from the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, and NIH contracts 75N93019C0063, 75N91019D00024, and HHSN272201800013C, and NIH grants T32-AI118690, T32-AI007044, K08-AI119142, and K23-AI140918.","Boonyaratanakornkit, Jim; Morishima, Chihiro; Selke, Stacy; Zamora, Danniel; McGuffin, Sarah; Shapiro, Adrienne E; Campbell, Victoria L; McClurkan, Christopher L; Jing, Lichen; Gross, Robin; Liang, Janie; Postnikova, Elena; Mazur, Steven; Lukin, Vladimir V; Chaudhary, Anu; Das, Marie K; Fink, Susan L; Bryan, Andrew; Greninger, Alex L; Jerome, Keith R; Holbrook, Michael R; Gernsheimer, Terry B; Wener, Mark H; Wald, Anna; Koelle, David M",J. clin. invest,,571

481560,A curated collection of COVID-19 online datasets,2020-07-19,"The interactions between chemokine receptors and their ligands may affect susceptibility to infectious diseases as well as their clinical manifestations. These interactions mediate both the traffic of inflammatory cells and virus-associated immune responses. In the context of viral infections, the human C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) receives great attention from the scientific community due to its role as an HIV-1 co-receptor. The genetic variant CCR5&#916;32 (32 base-pair deletion in CCR5 gene) impairs CCR5 expression on the cell surface and is associated with protection against HIV infection in homozygous individuals. Also, the genetic variant CCR5&#916;32 modifies the CCR5-mediated inflammatory responses in various conditions, such as inflammatory and infectious diseases. CCR5 antagonists mimic, at least in part, the natural effects of the CCR5&#916;32 in humans, which explains the growing interest in the potential benefits of using CCR5 modulators for the treatment of different diseases. Nevertheless, beyond HIV infection, understanding the effects of the CCR5&#916;32 variant in multiple viral infections is essential to shed light on the potential effects of the CCR5 modulators from a broader perspective. In this context, this review discusses the involvement of CCR5 and the effects of the CCR5&#916;32 in human infections caused by the following pathogens: West Nile virus, Influenza virus, Human papillomavirus, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, Poliovirus, Dengue virus, Human cytomegalovirus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Enterovirus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Hantavirus. Subsequently, this review addresses the impacts of CCR5 gene editing and CCR5 modulation on health and viral diseases. Also, this article connects recent findings regarding extracellular vesicles (e.g., exosomes), viruses, and CCR5. Neglected and emerging topics in ""CCR5 research"" are briefly described, with focus on Rocio virus, Zika virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Rhinovirus. Finally, the potential influence of CCR5 on the immune responses to coronaviruses is discussed.","Ellwanger, Joel Henrique; Kulmann-Leal, Bruna; Kaminski, Valéria de Lima; Rodrigues, Andressa Gonçalves; Bragatte, Marcelo Alves de Souza; Chies, José Artur Bogo",Virus Res,,571

An understanding of the dynamics of these populations and a characterization of these populations are necessary for action planning. The proposed strategies should be monitored and evaluated so that canine and feline population management programs are properly implemented. Population management programs can be improved through evidence based adaptive management. The objective of this study was to characterize the canine and feline populations and their dynamics in an urban area and to evaluate the impact of a birth control program. Three cross-sectional census surveys and a birth control program were conducted in a neighborhood of São Paulo area with 4,275 households. The two first surveys were performed in 2005 and 2006, prior to implementation of the birth control program, and were used to characterize the canine and feline populations. The third survey was performed in 2008, eighteen months after the birth control strategy had been established. The canine population decreased from 2006 to 2008, after birth control.

Since PLMs capture word semantics in different contexts, the quality of word representations highly depends on word frequency, which usually follows a heavy-tailed distributions in the pre-training corpus. Therefore, the embeddings of rare words on the tail are usually poorly optimized. In this work, we focus on enhancing language model pre-training by leveraging definitions of the rare words in dictionaries (e.g., Wiktionary). To incorporate a rare word definition as a part of input, we fetch its definition from the dictionary and append it to the end of the input text sequence. In addition to training with the masked language modeling objective, we propose two novel self-supervised pre-training tasks on word and sentence-level alignment between input text sequence and rare word definitions to enhance language modeling representation with dictionary. We evaluate the proposed Dict-BERT model on the language understanding benchmark GLUE and eight specialized domain benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dict-BERT can significantly improve the understanding of rare words and boost model performance on various NLP downstream tasks.","Yu, Wenhao; Zhu, Chenguang; Fang, Yuwei; Yu, Donghan; Wang, Shuohang; Xu, Yichong; Zeng, Michael; Jiang, Meng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06490v1.pdf,571

One would be the anti-infectious and immunomodulatory action that it exerts by improving intercellular barriers by stimulating innate immunity, as well as by modulating adaptive immunity. Also, vitaminD reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-2 and interferon-gamma (INF-Î³). More recently, multiple pleiotropic effects have been demonstrated on the actions of vitaminD at the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory level with positive results in studies with influenza, coronavirus, and other respiratory infections. An inverse relationship between serum vitaminD levels and the prevalence of the respiratory infectious disease has been described. Of interest, another mechanistic approach responds to considering the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which is exacerbated in COVID-19 infection because the virus binds to the enzyme ACE2, making more angiotensinII available to cause damage. VitaminD inhibits mediators of RAAS - present in all cells of the body - and by inhibiting ACE activity and increasing ACE2, it lowers angiotensinII levels. We present studies with proposals for recommended doses of vitaminD, and although a single guideline is not specified, the possible benefits are promising. Finally, the purpose of this review is to share this idea with health professionals to ignite the debate and call for critical reflection, so that it can contribute to the undertaking of more and better clinical designs to validate the benefits of using high doses of vitaminD for the benefit of public health and especially in times of crisis for COVID-19.","Mansur, José Luis; Tajer, Carlos; Mariani, Javier; Inserra, Felipe; Ferder, León; Manucha, Walter",Clin. investig. arterioscler.

484094,Thinking beyond the griefs of COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Assessing the effect of surfactant on clinical outcome in patients with COVID-19 under mechanical ventilation TRIAL DESIGN: Single centre, two arm, parallel group (1:1 allocation ratio), randomised superiority trial with blinded care and outcome assessment. PARTICIPANTS: Inclusion criteria: Adult COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU in Modarres hospital, Tehran, Iran (age range of 18 to 99 years) with moderate to severe ARDS (based on definition of P/F ratio) requiring auxiliary respiratory devices (either intubation or face mask). EXCLUSION CRITERIA: â Existence of a major underlying pulmonary disease in addition to COVID-19 â Underlying congenital heart disease â Patients needing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) â ARDS primarily due to any other reason rather than COVID-19 â The primary source of pulmonary involvement was bacterial pneumonia or any other etiology except for COVID-10 induced lung involvement â Those who refused to continue the study (either the patient or their family) â any patient had any sign of healing before entering the study leading to discharge from ICU in less than 12 hours INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: In the intervention group, the dose of the drug is a vial containing 4 ml, equivalent to 100 mg, which is prescribed for an adult weighing about 70 kg each time, and if the patient's weight is much lower or higher, it will be adjusted accordingly. Surfactant is prescribed inside the trachea in two doses, starting on the day of intubation with a second dose 6 hours later. The control group will receive the same volume of normal saline, based on weight, administered into the trachea with the same time schedule. MAIN OUTCOMES: 30 days mortality; patient mortality during stay in ICU up to 30 days; ICU length of stay up to 30 days; Time under mechanical ventilation up to 30 days. RANDOMISATION: After the participant enters the study, i.e. after the qualification of the patients in the trial is confirmed and their informed written consent is taken, we will use a simple randomisation method using a table of random numbers. In order to hide the random allocation process, a central randomisation approach will be used and the random sequence will be at the disposal of one of the researchers, excluding the principal investigator. BLINDING (MASKING): Participants, healthcare providers and the principal investigator assessing the outcomes will all be blinded to the group assignment.

484640,COVID-19 trial co-enrolment and subsequent enrolment,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Pandemics like coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) bring along many individual and social problems. We aimed to investigate what changes the COVID-19 pandemic can cause in patients with epilepsy on drug compliance and stigmatization. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Modified Morisky Scale (MMS) and stigmatization scales were used between October and November 2019 to assess drug compliance and stigmatization in epilepsy patients. These scales were renewed in June and July 2020 in the same patient group to assess the impact of the epidemic on drug compliance and stigmatization in patients with epilepsy. Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical software SPSS 17.0 for Windows (SPSS, Inc). Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were recorded in SPSS. The interviews were conducted during the interictal period. Paired-samples t-test was used to compare the stigma scale results of epilepsy patients before and during COVID-19. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare MMS groups before and during COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 110 patients were included in the study. There was no significant difference between the pre-pandemic and pandemic period in epilepsy stigma scale used to evaluate stigmatization levels in patients. During the pandemic period, it was observed that patients had higher motivation and higher knowledge than before the pandemic (pâ¯=â¯0.048). There were seven patients (6.4%) whose seizure frequency increased during the pandemic period. There were two patients (1.8%) who had difficulty in accessing drugs during the pandemic period. In multivariate analysis, only parameter that predicted an increase in seizure frequency was the number of drugs used In the of COVID-19 period. In correlation analysis, a negative correlation was found between the stigma total score during COVID-19 period and education level. CONCLUSION: A slight increase in the frequency of seizures was observed in our patients during the pandemic period, and no significant problem was experienced in accessing drugs. The COVID-19 pandemic made patients more motivated and informed in drug compliance in the patient group and had no effect on stigmatization.","Gul, Zeynep Bastug; Atakli, Hayrunisa Dilek",Epilepsy Behav,,571

Subsequently, universities have chosen to either augment or suspend clinical placements. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to elicit patients' perspectives toward various approaches to clinical placements in ENT during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. METHODS: Cross-sectional questionnaires were given to patients attending the ENT department for routine out-patient care. Responses were measured using a five-point Likert scale. Seventy-nine patients completed the survey. RESULTS: Ninety-five per cent of respondents felt the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic had not reduced their comfort in interacting with medical students. Most participants reported being comfortable with students participating directly or remotely in their care, and with students having access to their anonymised data. Twenty-five per cent of participants stated that they are uncomfortable with consultations being recorded and shared for medical education purposes. CONCLUSION: A number of approaches to clinical placements remain acceptable to patients. Educational leads should continue to offer placements in ENT that can incorporate direct or remote observation of consultations.","Patel, B; Gera, R; Lozidou, A; Hannan, S A; Saeed, S R",J Laryngol Otol,,571
484809,Headaches at the time of Covid-19: Review of recent literature and new management approach for cephalalgic patients,2020,"INTRODUCTION: France has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety, depression, burn out and the high proportion of post-traumatic stress disorder proved to be the most expected troubles caused by this pandemic and the confinement. Medico-psychological emergency units (CUMP) have been solicited at the very early stage of the pandemic because CUMP units are very well known by the French government and systematically associated to emergency plans. METHODS: In this article we describe the process which has been developed to cope with the psychological needs in the general population. At a first level, platforms of volunteers specialised into listening were available. Then those platforms could directly mobilise the CUMP in case of psychiatric disorders. It ran over the whole first wave and it has been reactivated because of the second confinement in France. RESULTS: During the first wave, approximately 1% of all the calls made on the national Covid number required to be redirected to the listening platforms. Of this group, 4% were related to reactive pathology or a psychiatric decompensating that required adapted and specialised care. CONCLUSION: The high rates of psychological distress detected in the general population in recent scientific literature seem discrepant with our findings of relatively low reorientation towards the CUMP. Nevertheless, our study highlights that the response of the CUMP network in France during the first wave was supportive. The second wave displays its adaptability to the public health policies.","Prieto, Nathalie; Vignaud, Philippe; Darbon, Remy; Cheucle, Eric; Philippe, Jean-Marc",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,571

Shenqi compound (SC) is a traditional Chinese medicine formula widely used in the treatment of diabetes and diabetic complications. Although many randomized clinical trials have proved that SC can benefit a lot from diabetes and its complications, the systematic evaluation of the effect of SC on diabetic blood glucose control and inflammatory markers has not yet appeared. The purpose of this study is to provide evidence that the therapeutic effect of SC on diabetes and its multiple system complications is related to its control of blood glucose and inflammatory mediators. METHODS: Three English database and 4 Chinese medical databases will be searched from its inception to May 2020. Then 2 methodological trained researchers will screen the qualified articles by reading the title, abstract, and full texts according to an established inclusion and exclusion criteria. The assessment of risk of bias will be conducted by using the Cochrane collaboration's tool. We will conduct meta-analyses for fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, tumor necrosis factor, C-reactive protein or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and other outcomes. The heterogeneity of data will be evaluated by Cochrane X and I tests. Subgroup analysis will also be carried out. We will conduct sensitivity analysis to evaluate the stability of the results, funnel plot analysis, and Egger test to evaluate the publication bias, and assessment for the quality of evidence by the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluate system. RESULTS: The results of our research will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSION: In this study, we will systematically evaluate the influences of SC on glycemic measures and inflammatory markers of diabetes mellitus.

However, fuzzy rRT-PCR readouts with high Ct values are frequently encountered, resulting in uncertainty in diagnosis. METHODS: A Specific Enhancer for PCR-amplified Nucleic Acid (SENA) was developed based on the Cas12a trans-cleavage activity, which is specifically triggered by the rRT-PCR amplicons of the SARS-CoV-2 Orf1ab (O) and N fragments. SENA was first characterized to determine its sensitivity and specificity, using a systematic titration experiment with pure SARS-CoV-2 RNA standards, and was then verified in several hospitals, employing a couple of commercial rRT-PCR kits and testing various clinical specimens under different scenarios. FINDINGS: The ratio (10 min/5 min) of fluorescence change (FC) with mixed SENA reaction (mix-FCratio) was defined for quantitative analysis of target O and N genes, and the Limit of Detection (LoD) of mix-FCratio with 95% confidence interval was 1.2&#8804;1.6&#8804;2.1. Totally, 295 clinical specimens were analyzed, among which 21 uncertain rRT-PCR cases as well as 4 false negative and 2 false positive samples were characterized by SENA and further verified by next-generation sequencing (NGS). The cut-off values for mix-FCratio were determined as 1.145 for positive and 1.068 for negative. INTERPRETATION: SENA increases both the sensitivity and the specificity of rRT-PCR, solving the uncertainty problem in COVID-19 diagnosis and thus providing a simple and low-cost companion diagnosis for combating the pandemic.

DESIGN/SETTING: During March-June 2020, 502 workers at a Utah meat-processing facility (facility A) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Using merged data from the state disease surveillance system and facility A, we analyzed the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 positivity and worker demographics, work section, and geospatial data on worker residence. We analyzed worker survey responses to questions regarding COVID-19 knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors at work and home. PARTICIPANTS: (1) Facility A workers (n = 1373) with specimen collection dates and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results; (2) residential addresses of all persons (workers and nonworkers) with a SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test (n = 1036), living within the 3 counties included in the health department catchment area; and (3) facility A workers (n = 64) who agreed to participate in the knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: New cases over time, COVID-19 attack rates, worker characteristics by SARS-CoV-2 test results, geospatially clustered cases, space-time proximity of cases among workers and nonworkers; frequency of quantitative responses, crude prevalence ratios, and counts and frequency of coded responses to open-ended questions from the COVID-19 knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in race (P = .01), linguistic group (P < .001), and work section (P < .001) were found between workers with positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 test results. Geographically, only 6% of cases were within statistically significant spatiotemporal case clusters. Workers reported using handwashing (57%) and social distancing (21%) as mitigation strategies outside work but reported apprehension with taking COVID-19-associated sick leave. CONCLUSIONS: Mitigating COVID-19 outbreaks among workers in congregate settings requires a multifaceted public health response that is tailored to the workforce. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE: Tailored, multifaceted mitigation strategies are crucial for reducing COVID-19-associated health disparities among disproportionately affected populations.","Rogers, Tia M; Robinson, Susan J; Reynolds, Laura E; Ladva, Chandresh N; Burgos-Garay, Maria; Whiteman, Ari; Budge, Holly; Soto, Natalie; Thompson, Mariela; Hunt, Estee; Barson, Todd; Boyd, Andrew T",J. public health manag. pract.

Objectives and method: The author uses her experience of providing mental health supports to humanitarian aid workers and the pieces of training conducted for internal medicine practitioners to offer guidance on how to manage severe job-related stresses during the response to COVID-19 pandemic. This work reminds responders about their professional mission and purpose, but its extreme physical and mental demands can take a toll on their well-being and health. In CEs, the sheer volume of work and the emotional over-engagement tend to produce toxic fantasies (e.g., rescuer or helper fantasies), acting upon which threatens integrity of care and increases risks for both patients and providers. Accumulated fatigue and exposure to mass suffering and mortality can change the perceived value of life and increase reckless, risk-taking, and suicidal behaviors. Introducing a self-awareness framework prioritizes the awareness of the available choices and making situation-appropriate and informed decisions about balancing one's own and others' needs. The COVID-19 response has demonstrated that fostering peer supports, changing organizational culture, addressing self-awareness within a training and supervisory context, and strengthening supports for managers are important parts of disaster preparedness. It also revealed that more research is needed to better understand and meet the special psychological needs of healthcare responders.","Cherepanov, Elena",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,571

There are many sophisticated statistical algorithms for solving changepoint detection problem, although there is not much work devoted towards gradual changepoints as compared to abrupt ones. Here we present a new approach to solve changepoint detection problem using fuzzy rough set theory which is able to detect such gradual changepoints. An expression for the rough-fuzzy estimate of changepoints is derived along with its mathematical properties concerning fast computation. In a statistical hypothesis testing framework, asymptotic distribution of the proposed statistic on both single and multiple changepoints is derived under null hypothesis enabling multiple changepoint detection. Extensive simulation studies have been performed to investigate how simple crude statistical measures of disparity can be subjected to improve their efficiency in estimation of gradual changepoints. Also, the said rough-fuzzy estimate is robust to signal-to-noise ratio, high degree of fuzziness in true changepoints and also to hyper parameter values. Simulation studies reveal that the proposed method beats other fuzzy methods and also popular crisp methods like WBS, PELT and BOCD in detecting gradual changepoints. The applicability of the estimate is demonstrated using multiple real-life datasets including Covid-19. We have developed the python package""roufcp""for broader dissemination of the methods.","Bhaduri, Ritwik; Roy, Subhrajyoty; Pal, Sankar K.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.06370v1.pdf,571

Understanding the potential sources of bias and methods to alleviate biases in these studies is important for informing their design and analysis. Confounding by individual-level risk factors in observational studies like these is relatively well appreciated. Here, we show how geographic structure and the underlying, natural dynamics of epidemics can also induce noncausal associations. We take the approach of simulating serologic studies in the context of an uncontrolled or a controlled epidemic, under different assumptions about whether prior infection does or does not protect an individual against subsequent infection, and using various designs and analytic approaches to analyze the simulated data. We find that in studies assessing whether seropositivity confers protection against future infection, comparing seropositive individuals to seronegative individuals with similar time-dependent patterns of exposure to infection, by stratifying or matching on geographic location and time of enrollment, is essential to prevent bias.","Kahn, Rebecca; Kennedy-Shaffer, Lee; Grad, Yonatan H; Robins, James M; Lipsitch, Marc",Am. j. epidemiol,,571

487208,"Information Overload, Wellbeing and COVID-19: A Survey in China",2021,"Chemotherapy is one of the main therapeutic strategies used for gastrointestinal tract adenocarcinomas (GTAs), but resistance to anticancer drugs is a substantial obstacle in successful chemotherapy. Accumulating evidence shows that non-coding RNAs, especially long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), can affect the drug resistance of tumor cells by forming a ceRNA regulatory network with mRNAs. The efficiency of the competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) network can be affected by the number and integrality of miRNA recognition elements (MREs). Dynamic factors such as RNA editing, alternative splicing, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), RNA-binding proteins and RNA secondary structure can influence the MRE activity, which may in turn be involved in the regulation of chemoresistance-associated ceRNA network by prospective approaches. Besides activities in a single tumor cell, the components of the tumor micoenvironment (TME) also affect the ceRNA network by regulating the expression of non-coding RNA directly or indirectly. The alternation of the ceRNA network often has an impact on the malignant phenotype of tumor including chemoresistance. In this review, we focused on how MRE-associated dynamic factors and components of TME affected the ceRNA network and speculated the potential association of ceRNA network with chemoresistance. We also summarized the ceRNA network of lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs which efficiently triggers chemoresistance in the specific types of GTAs and analyzed the role of each RNA as a ""promoter"" or ""suppressor"" of chemoresistance.","Raziq, Khadija; Cai, Mengdi; Dong, Kexian; Wang, Ping; Afrifa, Justice; Fu, Songbin",Biomed Pharmacother,,571

On one hand, the presence of the military, police and civil guards in the media and in the daily press conferences of the Spanish Government’s Coronavirus Crisis Committee and, on the other, tweets by the main political protagonists of the crisis in Spain: the leaders of the five largest national parties (PSOE, PP, Vox, Unidas Podemos and Ciudadanos) and the presidents of four autonomous communities (Catalonia, Madrid, the Valencian Community and the Basque Country) who also pla-yed a particularly important role in managing the crisis. The timeframe covered is from March 15 (start of the state of emergency) to April 25 (final day in which the military and security forces participated in the daily press conferences of the Coronavirus Crisis Committee). The methodology applied involves a qualitative analysis of the appearances by military and security forces in the media and in the press conferences of the aforementioned Committee, which allows us to outline a complex narrative of the events. A content analysis of the Twitter accounts is also performed to show the presence of these groups and the warlike language in their messages. The objectives are to balance the Government’s communication strategy in relation to the presence of the military, the Civil Guard and the National Police_ internally (at press conferences) and externally (in the media and, in particular, in speeches by political leaders).","López-García, Guillermo",Prof. Inf.,,571
487668,Refugee-led responses in the fight against COVID-19: building lasting participatory models,2020,"BACKGROUND: Erectile dysfunction (ED), as the hallmark of endothelial dysfunction, could be a short- or long-term complication of COVID-19. Additionally, being ED a clinical marker and predictor of non-communicable chronic diseases, particularly cardiovascular, subjects with ED could potentially have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of ED among subjects with a reported diagnosis of COVID-19 and to measure the association of COVID-19 and ED. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed data from the Sex@COVID online survey (performed between April 7 and May 4, 2020, in Italy) to retrieve a sample of Italian male sexually active subjects with reported SARS-CoV-2 infection. A matching sample of COVID-19-negative male sexually active subjects was also retrieved using propensity score matching in a 3:1 ratio. The survey used different standardized psychometric tools to measure effects of lockdown and social distancing on the intrapsychic, relational, and sexual health of Italian subjects. RESULTS: One hundred subjects were included in the analysis (25 COVID-positive; 75 COVID-negative). The prevalence of ED, measured with the Sexual Health Inventory for Men, was significantly higher in the COVID+ group (28% vs. 9.33%; p = 0.027). Logistic regression models confirmed a significant effect of COVID-19 on the development of ED, independently of other variables affecting erectile function, such as psychological status, age, and BMI [OR 5.66, 95% CI: 1.50-24.01]. Likewise, subjects with ED were more likely to have COVID-19, once corrected for age and BMI [OR 5.27, 95% CI: 1.49-20.09]. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: On top of well-described pathophysiological mechanisms, there is preliminary evidence in a real-life population of ED as a risk factor of developing COVID-19 and possibly occurring as a consequence of COVID-19. Universal vaccination against the COVID-19 and the personal protective equipment could possibly have the added benefit of preventing sexual dysfunctions.","Sansone, Andrea; Mollaioli, Daniele; Ciocca, Giacomo; Colonnello, Elena; Limoncin, Erika; Balercia, Giancarlo; Jannini, Emmanuele A",Andrology,,571
488108,WHO COVID-19 case definition,2020,"During the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic, the UK government took the decision to centralise the procurement, allocation and distribution of mission-critical intensive care unit (ICU) medical equipment. Establishing new supply chains in the context of global shortages presented significant challenges. This report describes the development of an innovative platform developed rapidly and voluntarily by clinical engineers, to mobilise the UK's shared medical equipment inventory, in order to match ICU capacity to dynamically evolving clinical demand. The 'Coronavirus ICU Medical Equipment Distribution' platform was developed to optimise ICU equipment allocation, distribution, collection, redeployment and traceability across the National Health Service. Although feedback on the platform has largely been very positive, the platform was built for a scenario that did not fully materialise in the UK and this affected the implementation approach. As such, it was not used to its full potential. Nonetheless, the platform and the insights derived and disseminated in its development have been extremely valuable. It provides a prototype for not only optimising system capacity in future pandemic scenarios but also a means for maximally exploiting the large amount of new equipment in the UK health system, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. This early stage innovation has demonstrated that a system-wide pooled information resource can benefit the operations of individual organisations. It has also generated numerous lessons to be borne in mind in innovation projects.","Akinluyi, Emmanuel Adeoluwa; Stell, David; Perera, Nayanee; Sibley-Allen, Christopher",,,571

However, the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 re-infection, including the levels and role of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein IgG antibodies and the half-maximal concentration (IC50) of neutralizing antibodies remain unknown. METHODS: Both the epidemiological and clinical information has been collected during two episodes of COVID-19 in a patient. Laboratory results, including RT-PCR, Ct values, anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein IgG antibodies, and the IC50 of neutralizing antibodies levels were analyzed on the patient. RESULTS: The patient was a 58-year-old man who developed moderate COVID-19 pneumonia with oxygen demand (cannula 2 L/min) in the first episode. By day 30, he recuperated and was discharged after testing negative for SARS-CoV-2. After two and a half months, his three family members showed COVID-19 symptoms and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 once again and was asymptomatic (the second episode). The IC50 of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 greatly increased from 50.0 µg/mL (after the first episode) to 14.8 µg/mL (after the second episode), and remained strongly reactive (20.1 µl/mL) after 47 days of the second episode. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological, clinical, and serological analyses confirmed that the patient had re-infection instead of persistent viral shedding from first infection. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 re-infection may manifest as asymptomatic with increased neutralizing antibody levels. Further studies such as the virus characteristics, immunology, and epidemiology on SARS-CoV-2 re-infection are needed.","Inada, Makoto; Ishikane, Masahiro; Terada, Mari; Matsunaga, Akihiro; Maeda, Kenji; Tsuchiya, Kiyoto; Miura, Kenji; Sairenji, Yu; Kinoshita, Noriko; Ujiie, Mugen; Kutsuna, Satoshi; Ishizaka, Yukihito; Mitsuya, Hiroaki; Ohmagari, Norio",J Infect Chemother,,571

One such entity is takotsubo cardiomyopathy. We sought to review the various cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy reported during the COVID-19 pandemic and consolidate the information available on its clinical features, evaluation and treatment. We performed a PubMed search using the MeSH terms ""Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy"" or ""Stress Cardiomyopathy"" and ""COVID-19"", and identified 16 case reports, two case series, and one retrospective cohort study. There was a total of 24 reported patients with COVID-19 infection, who developed takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and two patients without COVID-19 who developed takotsubo cardiomyopathy due to the emotional stress associated with the global pandemic. The mean age of the patients was 67.19 years (SD 15.83) and 16(59.3%) were women. Chest pain was reported in only ten patients (38.46 %) and ST-elevation was seen in 11 patients (42.3%). While most patients had typical takotsubo cardiomyopathy, four patients had inverted(reverse) takotsubo cardiomyopathy, two had bi-ventricular involvement, one had median takotsubo and another had global takotsubo with apical sparing variant. Most patients had a positive outcome with complete or near-complete reversal of cardiac dysfunction at the time of discharge. Five deaths (19.23%) were reported. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a rare, but increasingly reported reversible cardiomyopathy that can be seen in patients with COVID-19 infection and the diagnosis must be actively sought for in these patients.","John, Kevin; Lal, Amos; Mishra, Ajay",Monaldi arch. chest dis,,571

The average age of respondents ranged from 19 to 47 years old, comprised of more females. Almost one-half and one-fifth of the respondents gained and lost weight during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. Among articles that examined weight, diet and physical activity changes concurrently, weight gain was reported alongside a 36.3% to 59.6% increase in total food consumption and a 67.4% to 61.4% decrease in physical activities. Weight gain predictors included female sex, middle-age, increased appetite, snacking after dinner, less physical exercise, sedentary behaviors of &#8805;6 h/day, low water consumption and less sleep at night. Included articles did not illustrate significant associations between alcohol consumption, screen time, education, place of living and employment status, although sedentary behaviors, including screen time, did increase significantly.

The prominent perieccrine inflammation is helpful in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infections. Currently, nonischemic pathological findings correlate with a good prognosis based on the paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic nature of their disease courses. Patients presenting with suspected COVID-19 infection-induced chilblains who are paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic should be isolated and immediately tested with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing (as there is a delay in diagnosis based on the poor sensitivity of the current rapid test).

Severe COVID-19 patients have elevated blood levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1ß, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)&#945;, IL-8 and interferon (IFN)Î³. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of antiviral treatment serum cytokines in severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Blood was obtained from 29 patients (aged 32-79 yr) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 upon admission and 7 days after antiviral (Favipiravir or Lopinavir/Ritonavir) treatment. Patients also received standard supportive treatment in this retrospective observational study. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans were evaluated to investigate lung manifestations of COVID-19. Serum was also obtained and cytokines levels were evaluated. 19 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were studied. RESULTS: Anti-viral therapy significantly reduced CT scan scores and the elevated serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In contrast, serum levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IFNÎ³ were elevated at baseline in COVID-19 subjects compared to healthy subjects with IL-6 (p = 0.006) and IL-8 (p = 0.011) levels being further elevated after antiviral therapy. IL-1ß (p = 0.01) and TNF&#945; (p = 0.069) levels were also enhanced after treatment but baseline levels were similar to those of healthy controls. These changes occurred irrespective of whether patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. CONCLUSION: Antiviral treatments did not suppress the inflammatory phase of COVID-19 after 7 days treatment although CT, CRP and LDH suggest a decline in lung inflammation. There was limited evidence for a viral-mediated cytokine storm in these COVID-19 subjects.","Mortaz, Esmaeil; Bassir, Ali; Dalil Roofchayee, Neda; Dezfuli, Neda K; Jamaati, Hamidreza; Tabarsi, Payam; Moniri, Afshin; Rezaei, Mitra; Mehrian, Payam; Varahram, Mohammad; Marjani, Majid; Mumby, Sharon; Adcock, Ian M",Int Immunopharmacol,,571

In addition to occupational risk factors, the increased use of telecommunication and changed work environment may contribute to voice and vocal tract discomfort (VTD). This study established the prevalence, incidence, characteristics and impact of self-perceived dysphonia and VTD in those working from home during COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional, observational study using an online survey recruited 1575 participants. It captured information about dysphonia and VTD presence, onset, and severity. Those with dysphonia completed the voice-related quality of life to measure impact. Regression analyses identified risk factors for voice and vocal tract problems. RESULTS: Dysphonia and VTD prevalence rates were 33% and 68%, respectively, incidences were 28% and 50%. Perceived dysphonia severity was mild in 72% of cases. Dry throat was the most common VTD symptom at 66%. Mean voice-related quality of life score was 82.4 (standard deviation ± 13.2). Raising or straining the voice while working predicted new onset dysphonia and VTD. Increasing telecommunication use was associated with worse dysphonia and VTD onset. CONCLUSION: Those working from home have seen a rise in dysphonia and VTD, which were associated with communication modality and change in environment. If home offices become the 'new normal' post-COVID, workplaces should consider voice training for employees to limit potential difficulties.","Kenny, Ciarán",J. voice,,571

METHODS: Cross-sectional multicenter study including all diagnosis of KD, myocarditis and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) from February to April,2020. KD patients were compared to those diagnosed before the epidemic. RESULTS: KD: 8 patients (6/8 boys, all negative for SARS-CoV-2); complete presentation in 5/8; 7/8 IVIG-responders; 3/8 showed transient coronary lesions (CALs). MYOCARDITIS: one 5-year-old girl negative for SARS-CoV-2, positive for Parvovirus B19. She responded to IVIG.

This has created an urgent need to provide a solution to optimally distribute the available vaccines once they are received by the authorities. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based solution to select optimal distribution centers and a Constraint Satisfaction Problem framework to optimally distribute the vaccines taking into consideration two factors namely priority and distance. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed models using real-world data obtained from the district of Chennai, India. The model provides the decision making authorities with optimal distribution centers across the district and the optimal allocation of individuals across these distribution centers with the flexibility to accommodate a wide range of demographics.","Emu, Mahzabeen; Chandrasekaran, Dhivya; Mago, Vijay; Choudhury, Salimur",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04251v1.pdf,571

494590,Low-value Clinical Practices in Adult Traumatic Brain Injury: an Umbrella Review,2020,"BACKGROUND: To mitigate and slow the spread of COVID-19, many countries have adopted unprecedented physical distancing policies, including the UK. We evaluate whether these measures might be sufficient to control the epidemic by estimating their impact on the reproduction number (R0, the average number of secondary cases generated per case). METHODS: We asked a representative sample of UK adults about their contact patterns on the previous day. The questionnaire was conducted online via email recruitment and documents the age and location of contacts and a measure of their intimacy (whether physical contact was made or not). In addition, we asked about adherence to different physical distancing measures. The first surveys were sent on Tuesday, 24 March, 1 day after a ""lockdown"" was implemented across the UK. We compared measured contact patterns during the ""lockdown"" to patterns of social contact made during a non-epidemic period. By comparing these, we estimated the change in reproduction number as a consequence of the physical distancing measures imposed. We used a meta-analysis of published estimates to inform our estimates of the reproduction number before interventions were put in place. RESULTS: We found a 74% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed per participant (from 10.8 to 2.8). This would be sufficient to reduce R0 from 2.6 prior to lockdown to 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.89) after the lockdown, based on all types of contact and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.22-0.53) for physical (skin to skin) contacts only. CONCLUSIONS: The physical distancing measures adopted by the UK public have substantially reduced contact levels and will likely lead to a substantial impact and a decline in cases in the coming weeks. However, this projected decline in incidence will not occur immediately as there are significant delays between infection, the onset of symptomatic disease, and hospitalisation, as well as further delays to these events being reported. Tracking behavioural change can give a more rapid assessment of the impact of physical distancing measures than routine epidemiological surveillance.","Jarvis, Christopher I; Van Zandvoort, Kevin; Gimma, Amy; Prem, Kiesha; Klepac, Petra; Rubin, G James; Edmunds, W John",BMC Med,,571
494677,Biometrics in the Era of COVID-19: Challenges and Opportunities,2021-02-18,"OBJECTIVE: To explore whether hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 and neurologic symptoms have evidence of CNS infection, inflammation and injury using CSF biomarker measurements. METHODS: We assessed CSF SARS-CoV-2 RNA along with CSF biomarkers of intrathecal inflammation (CSF white blood cell count, neopterin, ß2-microglobulin (ß2M) and immunoglobulin G-index), blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity (albumin ratio), and axonal injury (CSF neurofilament light chain protein [NfL]) in 6 patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 and neurologic symptoms who had undergone a diagnostic lumbar puncture. Neurologic symptoms and signs included features of encephalopathies (4/6), suspected meningitis (1/6) and dysgeusia (1/6). SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by rtPCR analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the plasma of 2 patients (Cycle threshold [Ct] value 35.0-37.0) and in CSF at low levels (Ct 37.2, 38.0, 39.0) in 3 patients in one but not in a second rtPCR assay. CSF neopterin (median, 43.0 nmol/L) and ß2-microglobulin (median, 3.1 mg/L) were increased in all. Median IgG-index (0.39), albumin ratio (5.35) and CSF white blood cell count (<3 cells/µL) were normal in all, while CSF NfL was elevated in 2 patients. CONCLUSION: Our results on patients with COVID-19 and neurologic symptoms suggest an unusual pattern of marked CSF inflammation in which soluble markers were increased but white cell response and other immunologic features typical of CNS viral infections were absent. While our initial hypothesis centered on CNS SARS-CoV-2 invasion, we could not convincingly detect SARS-CoV-2 as the underlying driver of CNS inflammation. These features distinguish COVID-19 CSF from other viral CNS infections, and raise fundamental questions about the CNS pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Edén, Arvid; Kanberg, Nelly; Gostner, Johanna; Fuchs, Dietmar; Hagberg, Lars; Andersson, Lars-Magnus; Lindh, Magnus; Price, Richard W; Zetterberg, Henrik; Gisslén, Magnus",Neurology,,571

DesignProspective cohort SettingIndiana University Bloomington (IUB), a public university of 34,660 students in southern Indiana. ParticipantsAt the beginning of the fall 2020 semester, we randomly sampled N=1,267 IU undergraduate students, aged 18 years or older and residing in Monroe County, IN. MeasurementsPrimary exposure was high-risk alcohol consumption measured with the AUDIT questionnaire. We used an AUDIT score of 8 or more as the cut-off score when detecting high-risk alcohol consumption. Primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion, assessed with two SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests, at baseline and endline. Secondary outcomes were a) self-reported new SARS-CoV-2 infection at the study endline, and b) self-reported symptomatic COVID-19 at baseline. FindingsPrevalence of high-risk alcohol consumption was 34%. We found that students with high-risk alcohol consumption status had 2.34 [95% CI: (1.29, 4.24)] times the risk of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and 1.89 [95% CI: (1.08, 3.32)] times the risk of self-reporting a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to students with no such risk. Moreover, students with high-risk alcohol consumption were 18% more likely to develop symptomatic COVID-19, though this association was not statistically significant. Similar results were found after adjusting for sex at birth, race, and year in school. Findings from sensitivity analyses corroborated these results and suggested potential for a dose-response relationship. ConclusionsIn this sample of American college students, high-risk alcohol consumption was associated with higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion/infection. These findings could have implications for colleges reopening planning in fall 2021.","Kianersi, Sina; Ludema, Christina; Macy, Jonathan T.; Chen, Chen; Rosenberg, Molly",,,571

We aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors for delirium in older patients hospitalized with COVID-19, as well as its association with length of stay and mortality. METHODS: Retrospective study of patients aged &#8805; 65 years hospitalized with COVID-19. Data were collected from computerized medical records and all patients had delirium assessment at admission. Risk factors for delirium as well as the outcomes mentioned above were studied by two-group comparison, logistic regression and Cox proportional-hazard models. RESULTS: Of a total of 235 Caucasian patients, 48 (20.4%) presented with delirium, which was hypoactive in 41.6% of cases, hyperactive and mixed in 35.4% and 23.0%, respectively. Patients with cognitive impairment had a nearly four times higher risk of developing delirium compared to patients that were cognitively normal before SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR 3.7; 1.7-7.9 95% CI, p=0.001). The presence of delirium did not modify the time from symptoms' onset to hospitalization nor the length of stay in acute care, but it was associated with an increased risk of dying (HR 2.1; 1.2-3.7 95%CI; p=0.0113). CONCLUSION: Delirium was a prevalent condition in older people admitted with COVID-19 and pre-existing cognitive impairment was its main risk factor. Delirium was associated with higher in-hospital mortality. These results highlight the importance of early recognition of delirium especially when pre-morbid cognitive comorbidities are present.","Mendes, Aline; Herrmann, François R; Périvier, Samuel; Gold, Gabriel; Graf, Christophe E; Zekry, Dina","J. gerontol.

496096,Development of Intelligent Transportation System and Its Applications for an Urban Corridor During COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 symptoms mimic many other common conditions, making it difficult to identify patients infected with COVID-19. Adult patients may exhibit what is called ""COVID toes"" later in their course of illness. Noteworthy is that COVID toes may be the only symptom in otherwise asymptomatic young adults and children. CASE: We present experience with an adult female patient residing in the United States with presumed COVID-19 infection who was self-isolating with illness not severe enough to require hospitalization. COVID toes were one symptom experienced as a part of her illness. Because COVID toes are usually seen in the recovery phase of COVID-19, and often in patients with less severe cases, many providers are unfamiliar with this new symptom. CONCLUSION: Familiarity with COVID toes will help foot care providers to identify patients who may not have been diagnosed with COVID-19 but could still be infectious and need to be isolated. COVID toe signs may be subtle and often mimic other conditions such as chilblains/pernio, thus a thorough history and physical examination are required.","Beuscher, Tara L; Andrews, Sarah E",J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,,571

496747,Practical Considerations for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Fibrotic Interstitial Lung Disease During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly throughout the globe. The spectrum of disease is broad but among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of mortality. There is an urgent need for an effective treatment. The current focus has been developing novel therapeutics, including antivirals, protease inhibitors, vaccines, and targeting the overactive cytokine response with anti-cytokine therapy. The overproduction of early response proinflammatory cytokines results in what has been described as a ""cytokine storm"" is leading eventually to death when the cells fail to terminate the inflammatory response. Accumulating evidence shows that inflammatory cytokines induce selectin ligands that play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases by mediating leukocyte migration from the blood into the tissue. Thus, the selectins and selectin ligands represent a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of COVID-19. In this paper, potential pan-selectin inhibitors were identified employing a virtual screening using a docking procedure. For this purpose, the Asinex and ZINC databases of ligands, including approved drugs, biogenic compounds, and glycomimetics, altogether 923 602 compounds, were screened against the P-, L-, and E-selectin. At first, the experimentally confirmed inhibitors were docked into all three selectins' carbohydrate recognition domains to assess the suitability of the screening procedure. Finally, based on the evaluation of ligands binding, we propose ten purchasable pan-selectin inhibitors to develop COVID-19 therapeutics.","Smak, Pavel; Chandrabose, Selvaraj; Tvaroska, Igor; Koca, Jaroslav",Glycobiology,,571

497515,A Novel Ensemble-based Classifier for Detecting the COVID-19 Disease for Infected Patients,2021,"Understanding Covid-19 pathophysiology is crucial for a better understanding of the disease and development of more effective treatments. Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) is a constitutive tissue protector with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. A1AT inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection and two of the most important proteases in the pathophysiology of Covid-19: the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and the disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17). It also inhibits the activity of inflammatory molecules, such as IL-8, TNF-&#945;, and neutrophil elastase (NE). TMPRSS2 is essential for SARS-CoV-2-S protein priming and viral infection. ADAM17 mediates ACE2, IL-6R, and TNF-&#945; shedding. ACE2 is the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor and a key component for the balance of the renin-angiotensin system, inflammation, vascular permeability, and pulmonary homeostasis. In addition, clinical findings indicate that A1AT levels might be important in defining Covid-19 outcomes, potentially partially explaining associations with air pollution and with diabetes. In this review, we focused on the interplay between A1AT with TMPRSS2, ADAM17 and immune molecules, and the role of A1AT in the pathophysiology of Covid-19, opening new avenues for investigating effective treatments.","de Loyola, Mariana Braccialli; Dos Reis, Thaís Tereza Aguiar; de Oliveira, Guilherme Xavier Lyra Malcher; da Fonseca Palmeira, Julys; Argañaraz, Gustavo A; Argañaraz, Enrique R",Rev Med Virol,,571

METHODS: This is a retrospective review of CT scans of 110 patients. All 110 patients had initial and second CT scans, 60 of 110 patients had three serial CT scans, and 17 of 60 patients had four serial CT scans. Numerous characteristics of pulmonary and extrapulmonary abnormalities and recognizable patterns of evolution were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 110 initial CT scans, ground-glass opacities without consolidation (65.4%) were more common than a consolidation or mixed pattern. The most common findings were subpleural involvement (77.2%), multifocal involvement (80.7%), and bilateral involvement (67.3%). Three serial CT scans of 60 patients showed four patterns of CT evolution: type 1 showing relatively high CT scores on initial CT (averaged 4 days after symptom onset), with mild progression and improvement on follow-up CT scans (25%); type 2 with progression of CT findings from initial CT to first follow-up CT (averaged 9 days after symptom onset) with subsequent improvement on second follow-up CT (averaged 13 days after symptom onset, 61.7%); type 3 with no CT changes (5.0%); and type 4 pattern was similar to type 2 but with a more prolonged course and more severe CT findings (8.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Predominant findings at initial CT scans were bilateral multifocal subpleural GGO.

498205,COVID-19: A Personal and Professional Perspective,2021,"The past year has shown that obesity is a risk factor for severe complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Excess fat mass during obesity is known to be a risk factor for chronic diseases but also for severe infections and infectious complications. We have focused here on the elements responsible for this particular susceptibility to infections and more specifically to COVID-19. Excess fat is, in itself, responsible for alterations of the immune system by disrupting the production and function of immune cells. Indeed, hypertrophic adipocytes produce more pro-inflammatory adipokines (including cytokines). The increase in their apoptosis induces a release of pro-inflammatory compounds into the circulation and a recruitment of pro-inflammatory macrophages into the adipose tissue. A chronic systemic inflammatory state is then observed. In addition, diet, apart from its role in the development of adipose tissue, can also affect the immune system, with excess simple sugars and saturated fats exerting pro-inflammatory effects. This inflammation, the adipokines released by the adipocytes, and the infiltration of lipids into the lymphoid organs affects the production of immune cells and, directly, the functions of these cells. The alteration of the immune system increases the risk of infection as well as complications, including secondary bacterial infections and septic states, and increases infection-related mortality. During COVID-19, the chronic inflammatory state promotes the cytokine shock, characteristic of severe forms, caused in particular by excessive activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, in obese subjects, the already present endothelial dysfunction will render endothelial inflammation (endotheliitis) due to viral infiltration all the more severe.

The attitude towards flu vaccination in light of the COVID-19 pandemic has so far been studied in the literature mostly with the help of surveys and questionnaires. Whether a person chooses to be vaccinated or not during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, speaks louder than any declaration of intention. In our teaching hospital, we registered a statistically significant increase in flu vaccination coverage across all professional categories between the 2019/2020 and the 2020/2021 campaign (24.19% vs. 54.56%, p < 0.0001). A linear regression model, based on data from four previous campaigns, predicted for the 2020/2021 campaign a total flu vaccination coverage of 30.35%. A coverage of 54.46% was, instead, observed, with a statistically significant difference from the predicted value (p < 0.0001). The COVID-19 pandemic can, therefore, be considered as an incentive that significantly and dramatically increased adherence to flu vaccination among our healthcare workers.","Di Pumpo, Marcello; Vetrugno, Giuseppe; Pascucci, Domenico; Carini, Elettra; Beccia, Viria; Sguera, Anna; Zega, Maurizio; Pani, Marcello; Cambieri, Andrea; Nurchis, Mario Cesare; D039,; Ambrosio, Floriana; Damiani, Gianfranco; Laurenti, Patrizia",,,571

To study these responses, it is essential to identify protein-derived MHC-II peptide ligands that constitute epitopes for T cell recognition. However, generating cells expressing single MHC-II alleles and isolating these proteins for use in peptide elution or binding studies is time consuming. Here, we express human MHC alleles (HLA-DR4 and HLA-DQ6) as native, noncovalent &#945;ß dimers on yeast cells for direct flow cytometry-based screening of peptide ligands from selected antigens. We demonstrate rapid, accurate identification of DQ6 ligands from pre-pro-hypocretin, a narcolepsy-related immunogenic target. We also identify 20 DR4-binding SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides homologous to SARS-CoV-1 epitopes, and one spike peptide overlapping with the reported SARS-CoV-2 epitope recognized by CD4+ T cells from unexposed individuals carrying DR4 subtypes.

METHODS: Within the first wave of the VOICE study (n = 7765), a longitudinal web-based survey study among healthcare workers in Germany, we assessed symptoms of depression (PHQ-2) and generalized anxiety (GAD-2), social support (ENRICHD Social Support Inventory; ESSI), and generalized optimism as well as sociodemographic, occupational, and COVID-19 related variables. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between the constructs. RESULTS: The analyses revealed that higher levels of social support and optimism were associated with lower levels of depression and generalized anxiety. They showed a higher association with depression and generalized anxiety than demographic or occupational risk factors such as female gender and direct contact with infected individuals. CONCLUSION: Psychosocial resources such as social support and optimism appear to contribute to successful coping with the COVID-19 pandemic and should be considered in future studies.","Schug, Caterina; Morawa, Eva; Geiser, Franziska; Hiebel, Nina; Beschoner, Petra; Jerg-Bretzke, Lucia; Albus, Christian; Weidner, Kerstin; Steudte-Schmiedgen, Susann; Borho, Andrea; Lieb, Marietta; Erim, Yesim",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,571

To date, the various transmission modes of SARS-CoV-2 have not been completely determined. Food products might be carriers for SARS-CoV-2. The COVID-19 pandemic not only can spread through the respiratory tract like SARS and MERS but also the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces of several patients, shows the possibility of their fecal-oral route spread. Besides, people with gastric problems, including gastric intestinal metaplasia and atrophic gastritis, may be susceptible to this kind of COVID-19 infection. Accordingly, food may act as a potential vehicle of SARS-CoV-2 due to whether carry-through or carry-over contaminations. Considering carry-over, SARS-CoV-2 spread from personnel to food products or food surfaces is feasible. Beyond that, some shreds of evidence showed that pigs and rabbits can be infected by SARS-CoV-2. Thus, viral transmission through meat products may be conceivable, indicating carry-through contamination. As the spread rate of SARS-CoV-2 is high and its stability in different environments, especially food processing surfaces, is also remarkable, it may enter foods in whether industrialized processing or the traditional one. Therefore, established precautious acts is suggested to be applied in food processing units. The present review elucidates the risk of various staple food products, including meat and meat products, dairy products, bread, fruits, vegetables, and ready-to-eat foods as potential carriers for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Yekta, Reza; Vahid-Dastjerdi, Leily; Norouzbeigi, Sahar; Mortazavian, Amir M",Food Control,,571

However, little is known about the disease course in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). METHODS: Data for patients with AIH and SARS-CoV-2 infection were combined from 3 international reporting registries and outcomes were compared to those in patients with chronic liver disease of other aetiology (non-AIH CLD) and to patients without liver disease (non-CLD). RESULTS: Between 25th March and 24th October 2020, data were collected for 932 patients with CLD and SARS-CoV-2 infection including 70 with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). Fifty-eight (83%) patients with AIH were taking &#8805;1 immunosuppressive drug. There were no differences in rates of major outcomes between patients with AIH and non-AIH CLD, including hospitalization (76% vs. 85%; p = 0.06), intensive care unit admission (29% vs. 23%; p = 0.240), and death (23% vs. 20%; p = 0.643). Factors associated with death within the AIH cohort included age (odds ratio [OR] 2.16/10 years; 1.07-3.81), and Child-Pugh class B (OR 42.48; 4.40-409.53), and C (OR 69.30; 2.83-1694.50) cirrhosis, but not use of immunosuppression. Propensity score matched (PSM) analysis comparing patients with AIH with non-AIH CLD demonstrated no increased risk of adverse outcomes including death (+3.2%; -9.2%-15.7%). PSM analysis of patients with AIH vs. non-CLD (n = 769) demonstrated increased risk of hospitalization with AIH (+18.4%; 5.6-31.2%), but equivalent risk of all other outcomes including death (+3.2%; -9.1%-15.6%). CONCLUSION: Patients with AIH were not at increased risk of adverse outcomes despite immunosuppressive treatment compared to other causes of CLD and to matched cases without liver disease. LAY SUMMARY: Little is known about the outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), a rare chronic inflammatory liver disease. This study combines data from 3 large registries to describe the course of COVID-19 in this patient group. We show that AIH patients do not appear to have an increased risk of death from COVID-19 compared to patients with other forms of liver disease and compared to patients without liver disease, despite the use of medications which suppress the immune system.","Marjot, Thomas; Buescher, Gustav; Sebode, Marcial; Barnes, Eleanor; Barritt, A Sidney; Armstrong, Matthew J; Baldelli, Luke; Kennedy, James; Mercer, Carolyn; Ozga, Ann-Kathrin; Casar, Christian; Schramm, Christoph; Moon, Andrew M; Webb, Gwilym J; Lohse, Ansgar W",J. hepatol,,571

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between mortality in COVID-19 and platelet count, Mean Platelet Volume (MPV), and platelet distribution width. METHODS: In total, 215 COVID-19 patients were included in this study. The patients were divided into two groups. Patients with room air oxygen saturation < 90% were considered as severe COVID-19, and patients with &#8805;90% were considered moderate COVID-19. Patient medical records and the electronic patient data monitoring system were examined retrospectively. Analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical software. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The patients' mean age was 64,32 ± 16,07 years. According to oxygen saturation, 81 patients had moderate and 134 had severe COVID-19. Our findings revealed that oxygen saturation at admission and the MPV difference between the first and third days of hospitalization were significant parameters in COVID-19 patients for predicting mortality. While mortality was 8.4 times higher in patients who had oxygen saturation under 90 % at hospital admission, 1 unit increase in MPV increased mortality 1.76 times. CONCLUSION: In addition to the lung capacity of patients, the mean platelet volume may be used as an auxiliary test in predicting the mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Güçlü, Ertugrul; Kocayigit, Havva; Okan, Hüseyin Dogus; Erkorkmaz, Unal; Yürümez, Yusuf; Yaylaci, Selcuk; Koroglu, Mehmet; Uzun, Cem; Karabay, Oguz",Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),,571

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the effectivity of a program of control and prevention of COVID-19 in an academic general hospital in Spain. METHODS: We captured the number of COVID-19 cases and the type of contact that occurred in hospitalized patients and healthcare personnel (HCP). To evaluate the impact of the continuous use of a surgical mask among HCP, the number of patients with COVID-19 HAIs and accumulated incidence of HCP with COVID-19 was compared between the preintervention and intervention periods. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-two patients with COVID-19 have been admitted to the hospital. Seven of them had an HAI origin (6 in the preintervention period and 1 in the intervention period). One hundred forty-two HCP were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Of them, 22 (15.5%) were attributed to healthcare (2 in the emergency department and none in the critical care departments), and 120 (84.5%) were attributed to social relations in the workplace or during their non-work-related personal interactions. The accumulated incidence during the preintervention period was 22.3 for every 1000 HCP and 8.2 for every 1000 HCP during the intervention period. The relative risk was 0.37 (95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.55) and the attributable risk was -0.014 (95% confidence interval, -0.020 to -0.009). CONCLUSIONS: A program of control and prevention of HAIs complemented with the recommendation for the continuous use of a surgical mask in the workplace and social environments of HCP effectively decreased the risk of COVID-19 HAIs in admitted patients and HCP.","Gras-Valentí, Paula; Mora-Muriel, Juan G; Chico-Sánchez, Pablo; Algado-Sellés, Natividad; Soler-Molina, Victor M; Hernández-Maldonado, María; Lameiras-Azevedo, Ana S; Jiménez Sepúlveda, Natali J; Gómez Sotero, Isel L; Villanueva-Ruiz, César O; Barrenengoa-Sañudo, Julio; Fuster-Pérez, Marina; Cánovas-Jávega, Sandra; Cerezo-Milan, Patricia; Monerris-Palmer, Miranda; Llorens-Soriano, Pere; Merino-Lucas, Esperanza; Rodríguez-Diaz, Juan C; Gil-Carbonell, Joan; Sánchez-Martínez, Rosario; Pastor-Cesteros, Rogelio; Mena-Esquivias, Luis; Galiana-Ivars, Maria; Jaime-Sánchez, Francisco A; Margarit-Ferri, Cesar; Gonzalez-deDios, Javier; Lloret, German; García-Alonso, Miguel A; Sánchez-Vela, Pablo; Sánchez-Payá, José",J. patient saf,,571
502792,Human T leukaemia Type 1 and COVID-19,2020,"The response of the adaptive immune system is augmented by multimeric presentation of a specific antigen, resembling viral particles. Several vaccines have been designed based on natural or designed protein scaffolds, which exhibited a potent adaptive immune response to antigens;however, antibodies are also generated against the scaffold, which may impair subsequent vaccination. In order to compare polypeptide scaffolds of different size and oligomerization state with respect to their efficiency, including anti-scaffold immunity, we compared several strategies of presentation of the RBD domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, an antigen aiming to generate neutralizing antibodies. A comparison of several genetic fusions of RBD to different nanoscaffolding domains (foldon, ferritin, lumazine synthase, and beta-annulus peptide) delivered as DNA plasmids demonstrated a strongly augmented immune response, with high titers of neutralizing antibodies and a robust T-cell response in mice. Antibody titers and virus neutralization were most potently enhanced by fusion to the small beta-annulus peptide scaffold, which itself triggered a minimal response in contrast to larger scaffolds. The beta-annulus fused RBD protein increased residence in lymph nodes and triggered the most potent viral neutralization in immunization by a recombinant protein. Results of the study support the use of a nanoscaffolding platform using the beta-annulus peptide for vaccine design.","Lainscek, D.; Fink, T.; Forstneric, V.; Hafner-Bratkovic, I.; Orehek, S.; Strmsek, Z.; Mancek-Keber, M.; Pecan, P.; Esih, H.; Malensek, S.; Aupic, J.; Dekleva, P.; Plaper, T.; Vidmar, S.; Kadunc, L.; Bencina, M.; Omersa, N.; Anderluh, G.; Pojer, F.; Lau, K.; Hacker, D.; Correia, B.

Although direct and indirect renal injury by SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed, hemorrhagic renal infection or coagulative problems in the urinary tract have not yet been described. This case report describes a 35-year-old female without relevant medical history who, five days after having recovered from infection with SARS-CoV-2, had an unusual course of acute pyelonephritis of the right kidney and persistent fever under targeted antibiotic treatment. A hemorrhagic ureteral obstruction and severe swollen renal parenchyma preceded the onset of fever and was related to the developing pyelonephritis. Sudden thrombotic venous occlusion in the right eye appeared during admission. Symmetrical paresthesia in the limbs in combination with severe lower back pain and gastro-intestinal complaints also occurred and remained unexplained despite thorough investigation. We present the unusual combination of culture-confirmed bacterial hemorrhagic pyelonephritis with a blood clot in the proximal right ureter, complicated by retinal vein thrombosis, in a patient who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2-infection five days before presentation.

503642,Lubricant industry feeling the disruptions of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Rates of opioid prescribing tripled in the USA between 1999 and 2015 and were associated with significant increases in opioid misuse and overdose death. Roughly half of all opioids are prescribed in primary care. Although clinical guidelines describe recommended opioid prescribing practices, implementing these guidelines in a way that balances safety and effectiveness vs. risk remains a challenge. The literature offers little help about which implementation strategies work best in different clinical settings or how strategies could be tailored to optimize their effectiveness in different contexts. Systems consultation consists of (1) educational/engagement meetings with audit and feedback reports, (2) practice facilitation, and (3) prescriber peer consulting. The study is designed to discover the most cost-effective sequence and combination of strategies for improving opioid prescribing practices in diverse primary care clinics. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a hybrid type 3 clustered, sequential, multiple-assignment randomized trial (SMART) that randomizes clinics from two health systems at two points, months 3 and 9, of a 21-month intervention. Clinics are provided one of four sequences of implementation strategies: a condition consisting of educational/engagement meetings and audit and feedback alone (EM/AF), EM/AF plus practice facilitation (PF), EM/AF + prescriber peer consulting (PPC), and EM/AF + PF + PPC. The study's primary outcome is morphine-milligram equivalent (MME) dose by prescribing clinicians within clinics. The study's primary aim is the comparison of EM/AF + PF + PPC versus EM/AF alone on change in MME from month 3 to month 21. The secondary aim is to derive cost estimates for each of the four sequences and compare them. The exploratory aim is to examine four tailoring variables that can be used to construct an adaptive implementation strategy to meet the needs of different primary care clinics. DISCUSSION: Systems consultation is a practical blend of implementation strategies used in this case to improve opioid prescribing practices in primary care. The blend offers a range of strategies in sequences from minimally to substantially intensive. The results of this study promise to help us understand how to cost effectively improve the implementation of evidence-based practices. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04044521 (ClinicalTrials.gov).

The stressful situation faced by Chinese overseas students (COSs) has been particularly acute. With this population as the focus, the current study evaluated the psychological state of COSs abroad during the initial phases of the pandemic. Participants (N = 182) were recruited to complete an online survey (during April 7-14, 2020) assessing their physical and social circumstances, and sense of wellbeing. Results showed COSs experienced high levels of anxiety primarily stemming from discrimination from the media, fear of COVID-19, and mixed messages from their social connections. Feeling entrapped in a double bind (DbB) situation with their close relations significantly increased anxiety. Perceived social support negatively correlated with anxiety, and those experiencing a DbB felt the greatest stress, particularly those unable to effectively differentiate the opposing messages.

However, the extent to which stress associates with food choice motives is not completely understood. This study assessed whether emotional eating mediates the associations between perceived stress levels and food choice motives (i.e., health, mood, convenience, natural content, price, sensory appeal, familiarities, weight control, and ethical concerns) during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. A total of 800 respondents were surveyed in the United States in June 2020. Their perceived stress, emotional eating, and food choice motives were assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale, Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire, and Food Choice Questionnaire, respectively. Moderate to high levels of perceived stress were experienced by the majority (73.6%) of respondents. Perceived stress was significantly correlated with emotional eating (r = 0.26) as well as five out of nine food choice motives: mood (r = 0.32), convenience (r = 0.28), natural content (r = -0.14), price (r = 0.27), and familiarity (r = 0.15). Emotional eating was significantly correlated with four out of nine food choice motives: mood (r = 0.27), convenience (r = 0.23), price (r = 0.16), and familiarity (r = 0.16). The mediation analyses showed that emotional eating mediates the associations between perceived stress and five food choices motives: mood, convenience, sensory appeal, price, and familiarity.

Religious activities such as the Hajj pilgrimage have a major impact on patients with diabetes mellitus, including increasing the risk of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia. This increased risk is due to dietary changes and intense physical activity during pilgrimage while being on antidiabetic medications. Approximately 20% of the pilgrims with underlying illnesses who visit Mecca are diabetic, and complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis, nonketotic hyperosmolar state, and fatigue/unconsciousness due to hypoglycaemia, have been observed among these patients. Diabetic patients are also at a high risk for foot complications and infections. To avoid any aggravation of the diabetes, a complete biochemical evaluation of the patient must be conducted before Hajj, and the patients must be provided contextualized educational guidance to avert these potential health challenges. This counselling should include the importance of carrying with them at all time their relevant medical history, summaries of the current treatment regimen and emergency snacks. In addition, to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia, the dosage of insulin should be reduced in selected patients by 20% and that of sulfonylurea should be reduced as needed. Basal insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists are associated with fewer complications and can be preferentially prescribed. Those patients with type 1 diabetes can continue with the use of insulin pump with suitable education prior to Hajj. For the prevention of foot problems, the use of padded socks and well-fitting shoes is recommended along with an insistence on not walking barefoot. After Hajj, the patient must be followed up, and necessary investigations must be made along with readjustment of insulin dosage in those patients for whom it was reduced. Until the pandemic situation abates, all diabetic patients should avoid making the Hajj journey.","Shaikh, Shehla; Ashraf, Hamid; Shaikh, Khalid; Iraqi, Hinde; Ndour Mbaye, Maimouna; Kake, Amadou; Mohamed, Gaman Ali; Selim, Shahjada; Wali Naseri, Mohammad; Syed, Imran; Said, Jamil Abdul Kadir; Raza, S Abbas; Kassim, Hidayat; Aydin, Hasan; Latheef, Ali; Beebeejaun, Mehjabeen; Uloko, Andrew E; Pastakia, Sonak D; Kalra, Sanjay",Diabetes Ther,,571

Thus, there is a need of strong and sustainable global collaborative works especially in terms of new and existing data analysis and sharing which will join the dots of knowledge gap. Our present chemical-informatics based data analysis approach is an attempt of application of previous activity data of SARS-CoV main protease (Mpro) inhibitors to accelerate the search of present SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. The study design was composed of three major aspects: (1) classification QSAR based data mining of diverse SARS-CoV Mpro inhibitors, (2) identification of favourable and/or unfavourable molecular features/fingerprints/substructures regulating the Mpro inhibitory properties, (3) data mining based prediction to validate recently reported virtual hits from natural origin against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme. Our Structural and physico-chemical interpretation (SPCI) analysis suggested that heterocyclic nucleus like diazole, furan and pyridine have clear positive contribution while, thiophen, thiazole and pyrimidine may exhibit negative contribution to the SARS-CoV Mpro inhibition. Several Monte Carlo optimization based QSAR models were developed and the best model was used for screening of some natural product hits from recent publications. The resulted active molecules were analysed further from the aspects of fragment analysis. This approach set a stage for fragment exploration and QSAR based screening of active molecules against putative SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme. We believe the future in vitro and in vivo studies would provide more perspectives for anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents.","Ghosh, Kalyan; Amin, Sk. Abdul; Gayen, Shovanlal; Jha, Tarun",J. Mol. Struct.,,571

METHODS: In this multicentre retrospective study, we enrolled people with confirmed COVID-19 from 44 hospitals in Wuhan and Sichuan, China, between 18 January and 30 March 2020. We extracted demographics, clinical, laboratory data and consciousness level (as measured by the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score) from medical records. We used Cox proportional hazards regression, structural equation modelling and survival time analysis to compare people with different progressions of impaired consciousness. RESULTS: We enrolled 1,143 people (average age 51.3 ± standard deviation 17.1-year-old; 50.3% males), of whom 76 died. Increased mortality risk was identified in people with GCS score between 9 and 14 (hazard ratio (HR) 46.76, p < .001) and below 9 (HR 65.86, p < .001). Pathway analysis suggested a significant direct association between consciousness level and death. Other factors, including age, oxygen saturation level and pH, had indirect associations with death mediated by GCS scores. People who developed impaired consciousness more rapidly either from symptoms onset (<10 days vs. 10-19 days, p = .025, <10 days vs. &#8805;20 days and 10-19 days vs. &#8805;20 days, <.001) or deterioration of oxygen saturation (&#8804;2 days vs.>2 days, p = .028) had shorter survival times. CONCLUSION: Altered consciousness and its progression had a direct link with death in COVID-19. Interactions with age, oxygen saturation level and pH suggest possible pathophysiology. Further work to confirm these findings explore prevention strategies and interventions to decrease mortality is warranted.","Xiong, Weixi; Lu, Lu; Zhang, Baiyang; Luo, Jianfei; Li, Weimin; He, Li; Sander, Josemir W; Mu, Jie; Zhu, Cairong; Zhou, Dong",Acta neurol. scand,,571

Yet research with adolescent samples has typically focused on the experiences of victims rather than perpetrators, and males as perpetrators and females as victims. In the current article, we consider whether risk and protective factors operate similarly within and across sex assigned at birth. A national sample of youth, ages 14 and 15, were recruited via social media and surveyed online (N = 1,981). At the individual level, girls who sexually harassed others, were more likely to have a propensity to respond to stimuli with anger compared to boys who sexually harassed. At the relational level, girls who sexually harassed were more likely to be victims of sexual harassment compared to boys, and having a negative peer environment (have delinquent peers, seen someone get attacked, and know someone who has been sexually assaulted) was of particular importance in understanding why girls harass others. For boys who harass, family relations, having seen or heard about peer physical or sexual assault and bullying perpetration were important for contextualizing boys' sexual harassment. As empathy increased, the relative odds of sexually harassing decreased for girls. Future research should explore motivations for perpetrating sexual harassment, bystander interventions, and longitudinal frameworks to identify causal patterns to determine which factors inhibit or facilitate sexual harassment.","Stroem, Ida Frugård; Goodman, L Kimberly; Ybarra, Michele L; Mitchell, Kimberly J",J Interpers Violence,,571

Three-dimensional (3D) printed porous scaffolds incorporating osteoinductive components are considered as ideal bone grafts, because of the accurate control of structure parameters and the capacity to enhance bone tissue regeneration. Our previous studies demonstrated that nanoscale zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (nanoZIF-8), a subclass of metal organic frameworks (MOFs), presented minimal cytotoxicity, inhibited bacterial activities, and promoted osteogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. However, the application of nanoZIF-8 in the 3D printed scaffold system remains unknown. In this study, nanoZIF-8 was incorporated into composite scaffolds composed of polycaprolactone (PCL) and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) via extrusion-based 3D printing technology. The results revealed that the composite scaffolds possessed increased mechanical strength and exhibited homogeneous structure with highly interconnected macropores. In vitro studies indicated that scaffolds showed biocompatibility to bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), significantly up-regulated the expression of osteogenesis-related genes and proteins, and facilitated the extracellular matrix mineralization. In vivo results showed that 3D printed porous scaffolds promoted new bone formation and enhanced micro-architecture at the critical defect sites (&#934;10 mm) in rabbits, compared with the blank control group. Moreover, composite scaffolds significantly improved calvarial defect healing in comparison with scaffolds without nanoZIF-8 incorporation. In summary, nanoZIF-8 modified 3D printed porous composite scaffolds demonstrated great potential in the treatment of critical-sized bone defects, proving the effectiveness of MOF incorporation in 3D printed composite scaffolds to promote osteogenesis in the field of bone tissue engineering.","Zhong, Linna; Chen, Junyu; Ma, Zhiyong; Feng, Hao; Chen, Song; Cai, He; Xue, Yiyuan; Pei, Xibo; Wang, Jian; Wan, Qianbing",Nanoscale (Online),,571

509681,Combating COVID-19 in democratic taiwan and South Korea,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: One of the main goals of epidemiological studies is to build models capable of forecasting the prevalence of a contagious disease, in order to propose public health policies for combating its propagation. Here, the aim is to evaluate the influence of immune individuals in the processes of contagion and recovery from varicella. This influence is usually neglected. METHODS: An epidemic model based on probabilistic cellular automaton is introduced. By using a genetic algorithm, the values of three parameters of this model are determined from data of prevalence of varicella in Belgium and Italy, in a pre-vaccination period. RESULTS: This methodology can predict the varicella prevalence (with average relative error of 2%-4%) in these two European countries. Belgium data can be explained by ignoring the role of immune individuals in the infection propagation; however, Italy data can be explained by considering contagion exclusively mediated by immune individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The role of immune individuals should be accurately delineated in investigations on the dynamics of disease propagation. In addition, the proposed methodology can be adapted for evaluating, for instance, the role of asymptomatic carriers in the novel coronavirus spread.","Monteiro, L H A; Gandini, D M; Schimit, P H T",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,571
509917,The COVID-19 medicine remdesivir is therapeutically activated by carboxylesterase-1 AND excessive hydrolysis increases cytotoxicity,2021,"Background/Aim. The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) primarily affects the respiratory system, so radiological diagnosis has been shown to be necessary. Chest computed tomography (CT) is to be shown the best modality in suspected COVID-19 cases for initial evaluation because CT findings may be present before the onset of symptoms. The aim of this study was to show different CT imaging features or patterns in COVID-19 patients with a different time course and disease severity. Methods. This prospective cohort study analysed 330 patients (the average age was 52.37 ± 15.36) with confirmed COVID-19 via laboratory testing. During hospitalization, all patients included in the study underwent chest CT in order to assess the extent of changes in their lungs. COVID-19 patients, with a different time course and disease severity, were classified into four categories: lung, bronchial, pleural and mediastinal changes. Based on the time interval between the onset of symptoms and performed CT scan, all patients were divided into three groups: group 1 (CT scans done ≤ 1 week after symptom onset);group 2 (from &gt; 1 to 2 weeks after symptom onset);group 3 (from &gt; 2 weeks after symptom onset). In order to monitor the distribution of changes in the lungs more accurately, bilateral lungs were divided into 12 'lung' zones. Each zone was assigned a CT score. Total severity score was calculated by summing the scores for each zone. Results. In 93.6% patients with COVID-19, the CT findings were positive. About 92.1% patients had multiple lesions. The lesions were bilateral in 87.6% of patients, localized both peripheral and centrally in 63.3% of patients, and occurred more frequently in posterior areas (93%), as well as in lower lung zones (91.2%). The average total severity score was 11.00 (7.00-16.00). The most common CT findings in all patients were the ground-glass opacities (97.7%), reticular pattern (91.3%), consolidation (71.5%) and fibrotic streaks (63.8%). In the group 1, changes on CT were found in 80.0%, in the group 2 in 95.0%, and in the group 3 in 99.4% of the patients. Conclusion. CT is proven to be a very important diagnostic method in COVID-19 patients, and together with clinical and laboratory findings, gives a complete picture of the patient's condition and contributes significantly to decision-making for further treatment.

Kompjuterizovana tomografija (CT) grudnog koša pokazala se kao najbolji modalitet za inicijalnu procenu osoba sumnjivih na COVID-19, pošto CT nalaz može biti pozitivan i pre pojave simptoma. Cilj ove studije bio je da se prikažu različite CT karakteristike obolelih od COVID-19, sa različitim vremenskim tokom i težinom bolesti. Metode. Sprovedena je prospektivna kohortna studija na 330 bolesnika (prosečne starosti 52,37 ± 15,36) sa dijagnozom COVID-19, potvrđenom putem laboratorijskog testiranja. Tokom hospitalizacije, svim bolesnicima uključenim u studiju urađen je CT pregled grudnog koša u cilju procene proširenosti promena u plući-ma. Promene na CT snimcima podeljene su u četiri kategorije: plućne, bronhijalne, pleuralne i medijastinalne promene. Na osnovu vremenskog intervala od pojave simptoma do CT pregleda, bolesnici su bili podeljeni u tri grupe: prva grupa (≤ 7 dana);druga grupa (7-14 dana);treća grupa (&gt; 14 dana). U cilju što preciznijeg praćenja distribucije lezija u plućima, pluća su podeljena na 12 'plućnih' zona. Svakoj zoni je dodeljen CT skor. Total severity score bio je izračunat kao suma skorova pojedinih zona. Rezultati. Kod 93,6% obolelih od COVID-19, CT nalaz je bio pozitivan. Oko 92,1% bolesnika imalo je više lezija. Lezije su bile bilateralne kod 87,6% bolesnika, periferno i centralno lokalizovane kod 63,3% bolesnika, a češće su se javljale u posteriornim segmentima (93%), kao i u donjim plućnim zonama (91,2%). Prosečan Total severity score bio je 11,00 (7,00-16,00). Najčešći CT nalaz je bila opacifikacija po tipu „mlečnog stakla"" (97,7%), retikularna šara (91,3%), konsolidacija (71,5%) i fibrozne trake (63,8%). Promene na CT snimku nađene su kod 80.0% bolesnika iz prve grupe, kod 95.0% iz druge grupe i kod 99.4% iz treće grupe. Zaključak. CT se pokazao kao veoma važna dijagnostička metoda kod bolesnika sa COVID-19 i zajedno sa kliničkim i laboratorijskim nalazima daje potpunu sliku stanja bolesnika čime značajno utiče na donošenje odluka o daljem lečenju.

METHODS: The aim of the present study was to compare the 4C mortality score, other measures of the systemic inflammatory response and clinicopathological characteristics in two consecutive cohorts of patients on admission with COVID-19. Electronic patient records for 2 consecutive cohorts of patients admitted to two urban teaching hospitals with COVID-19 during two 7-week periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in Glasgow, U.K. (cohort 1: 17/3/2020-1/5/2020) and (cohort 2: 18/5/2020-6/7/2020) were examined for routine clinical, laboratory and clinical outcome data. RESULTS: Compared with cohort 1, cohort 2 were older (p<0.001), more likely to be female (p<0.05) and have less independent living circumstances (p<0.001). More patients in cohort 2 were PCR positive, CXR negative (both p<0.001) and had low serum albumin concentrations (p<0.001). 30-day mortality was similar between both cohorts (23% and 22%). In cohort 2, age >70 (p<0.05), male gender (p<0.05), COPD (p<0.05), cognitive impairment (p<0.05), frailty (p<0.001), delirium (p = 0.001), CRP>150mg/L (p<0.05), albumin <30 g/L (p<0.01), elevated perioperative Glasgow Prognostic Score (p<0.05), elevated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (p<0.001), low haematocrit (p<0.01), elevated PT (p<0.05), sodium <133 mmol/L (p<0.01) elevated urea (p<0.001), creatinine (p<0.001), glucose (p<0.05) and lactate (p<0.001) and the 4C score (p<0.001) were associated with 30-day mortality. In multivariate analysis, greater frailty (CFS>3) (OR 11.3, 95% C.I. 2.3-96.7, p<0.05), low albumin (<30g/L) (OR 2.5, 95% C.I. 1.0-6.2, p<0.05), high NLR (&#8805;3) (OR 2.2, 95% C.I. 1.5-4.5, p<0.05) and the 4C score (OR 2.4, 95% C.I. 1.0-5.6, p<0.05) remained independently associated with 30-day mortality. CONCLUSION: In addition to the 4C mortality score, frailty score and a low albumin were strongly independently associated with 30-day mortality in two consecutive cohorts of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

511036,Insights From the Virtual Team Science: Rapid Deployment During COVID-19,2021,"The use of water for drinking and agriculture requires knowledge of its toxicity. In this study, we compared the use of genetically modified bioluminescent (GMB) bacteria whose luminescence increases in the presence of toxicants and Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells for the characterization of the toxicity of water samples collected from a lake and streams, hydroponic and aquaponic farms, and a wastewater treatment plant. GMB bacteria were used to probe genotoxicity, cytotoxicity and reactive oxygen species-induced effects in the whole water samples. Unlike GMB bacteria, the use of CHO cells requires XAD resin-based pre-concentration of toxic material present in water samples for the subsequent cytotoxicity assay. In addition to the examination of the toxicity of the water from the different sources, the GMB bacteria were also used to test the XAD extracts diluted to the concentrations causing 50% growth inhibition of the CHO cells. The two biomonitoring tools provided different results when they were used to test the above-mentioned diluted XAD extracts. A pre-concentration procedure based on adsorption by XAD resins with subsequent elution was not sufficient to represent the material responsible for the toxicity of the whole water samples toward the GMB bacteria. Therefore, the use of XAD resin extracts may lead to major underestimates of the toxicity of water samples. Although the toxicity findings obtained using the GMB bacteria and CHO cells may not correlate with each another, the GMB bacteria assay did provide a mechanism-specific biomonitoring tool to probe the toxicity of water samples without a need for the pre-concentration step.","Manivannan, Bhuvaneshwari; Massalha, Nedal; Halahlih, Fares; Eltzov, Evgeni; Nguyen, Thanh H; Sabbah, Isam; Borisover, Mikhail",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,571

511831,Race and a decolonial turn in development studies,2020,"In recent years, the gravitational curvatures, the third-order derivatives of the gravitational potential (GP), of a tesseroid have been introduced in the context of gravity field modeling. Analogous to the gravity field, magnetic field modeling can be expanded by magnetic curvatures (MC), the third-order derivatives of the magnetic potential (MP), which are the change rates of the magnetic gradient tensor (MGT). Exploiting Poisson's relations between ( n + 1 ) th-order derivatives of the GP and nth-order derivatives of the MP, this paper derives expressions for the MC of a uniformly magnetized tesseroid using the fourth-order derivatives of the GP of a uniform tesseroid expressed in terms of the Cartesian kernel functions. Based on the magnetic effects of a uniform spherical shell, all expressions for the MP, magnetic vector (MV), MGT and MC of tesseroids have been examined for numerical problems due to singularity of the respective integral kernels (i.e., near zone and polar singularity problems). For this, the closed analytical expressions for the MP, MV, MGT and MC of the uniform spherical shell have been provided and used to generate singularity-free reference values. Varying both height and latitude of the computation point, it is found numerically that the near zone problem also exists for all magnetic quantities (i.e., MP, MV, MGT and MC). The numerical tests also reveal that the polar singularity problems do not occur for the magnetic quantity as a result of the use of Cartesian as opposed to spherical integral kernels. This demonstrates that the magnetic quantity including the newly derived MC 'inherit' the same numerical properties as the corresponding gravitational functional. Possible future applications (e.g., geophysical information) of the MC formulas of a uniformly magnetized tesseroid could be improved modeling of the Earth's magnetic field by dedicated satellite missions.","Deng, Xiao-Le; Shen, Wen-Bin; Kuhn, Michael; Hirt, Christian; Pail, Roland",Surv Geophys,,571

METHODS: Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples were collected without restriction on timing or alimentation by general practitioners from patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI) seen in consultation. Saliva samples were tested by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 and 21 other respiratory pathogens. Results for SARS-CoV-2 in saliva samples were compared to results obtained using a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) collected in a certified medical laboratory before or after the ARI consultation. RESULTS: Overall, 143 ARI patients were enrolled between 6 June 2020, and 19 January 2021. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 37.0% (n = 53) of saliva samples and in 39.0% (n = 56) of NPS. Both saliva and NPS were positive in 51 patients. Positive and negative results were concordant between saliva samples and NPS in 51 (96.2%) and in 85 (94.4%) patients, respectively, with a Cohen's Kappa coefficient of 0.89 (95% CI 0.82-0.97, p < 0.001). Other respiratory viruses were detected in 28.0% (n = 40) of the 143 saliva samples. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that saliva samples could represent an attractive alternative to NPS for surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in patients consulting for an ARI in primary care.","Masse, Shirley; Bonnet, Camille; Vilcu, Ana-Maria; Benamar, Hayat; Swital, Morgane; van der Werf, Sylvie; Carrat, Fabrice; Hanslik, Thomas; Blanchon, Thierry; Falchi, Alessandra",Viruses,,571

In parallel, the massive introduction of smart meters allows for the use of high frequency energy use time series data to segment electricity customers according to their demand response potential. This paper proposes a smart meter time series clustering methodology based on a two-stage k-medoids clustering of normalized load-shape time series organized around the day divided into 48 time points. Time complexity is drastically reduced by first applying the k-medoids on each customer separately, and second on the total set of customer representatives. Further time complexity reduction is achieved using time series representation with low computational needs. Customer segmentation is undertaken with only four easy-to-interpret features: average energy use, energy–temperature correlation, entropy of the load-shape representative vector, and distance to wind generation patterns. This last feature is computed using the dynamic time warping distance between load and expected wind generation shape representative medoids. The two-stage clustering proves to be computationally effective, scalable and performant according to both internal validity metrics, based on average silhouette, and external validation, based on the ground truth embedded in customer surveys.","Bañales, Santiago Dormido Raquel Duro Natividad",Energies,,571
513122,Psychotherapist experiences with telepsychotherapy: Pre COVID-19 lessons for a post COVID-19 world,2020,"Over 26 million cases have been confirmed worldwide (by 20 August 2020) since the Coronavirus disease (COIVD_19) outbreak in December 2019. Research studies have been addressing diverse aspects in relation to COVID_19 including potential symptoms, predictive tools and specifically, correlations with various demographic attributes. However, very limited work is performed towards the modelling of complex associations between the combined demographic attributes and varying nature of the COVID_19 infections across the globe. Investigating the underlying disease associations with the combined demographical characteristics might help in comprehensive analysis this devastating disease as well as contribute to its effective management. In this study, we present an intelligent model to investigate the multi-dimensional associations between the potentially relevant demographic attributes and the COVID_19 severity levels across the globe. We gather multiple demographic attributes and COVID_19 infection data (by 20 August 2020) from various reliable sources, which is then fed-into pattern matching algorithms that include self-organizing maps, class association rules and statistical approaches, to identify the significant associations within the processed dataset. Statistical results and the experts report indicate strong associations between the COVID_19 severity levels and measures of certain demographic attributes such as female smokers, when combined together with other attributes. These results strongly suggest that the mechanism underlying COVID_19 infection severity is associated to distribution of the certain demographic attributes within different regions of the world. The outcomes will aid the understanding of the dynamics of disease spread and its progression that might in turn help the policy makers and the society, in better understanding and management of the disease.","Khan, Wasiq; Hussain, Abir; Khan, Sohail Ahmed; Al-Jumailey, Mohammed; Nawaz, Raheel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.12923v2.pdf,571

Although ultrasound-guided (USG) TPVB has been described, there are no reports of USG multilevel TPVB for surgical anesthesia during PBCS. The aim of this prospective observational study was to determine the feasibility of performing USG multilevel TPVB, at the T1-T6 vertebral levels (6m-TPVB), and to evaluate its efficacy in providing surgical anesthesia for PBCS. Patients and Methods: Twenty-five female patients undergoing PBCS received an USG 6m-TPVB for surgical anesthesia. Four milliliters of ropivacaine 0.5% (with epinephrine 1:200,000) was injected at each vertebral level. Dexmedetomidine infusion (0.1-0.5 µg.kg-1.h-1) was used for conscious sedation. Success of the block, for surgical anesthesia, was defined as being able to complete the PBCS without having to resort to rescue analgesia or convert to GA. Results: The USG 6m-TPVB was successfully performed on all 25 patients but it was effective as the sole anesthetic in only 20% (5/25) of patients.

Surgery was successfully completed using small doses of intravenous ketamine (mean total dose, 38.0±20.5 mg) as supplementary analgesia. Conclusion: USG 6m-TPVB is technically feasible but does not consistently provide complete surgical anesthesia for PBCS that involves surgical dissection on the pectoralis major muscle and its fascia. Our data suggest that the pectoral nerves, which are not affected by a 6m-TPVB, are involved with afferent nociception.","Pangthipampai, Pawinee; Karmakar, Manoj K; Songthamwat, Banchobporn; Pakpirom, Jatuporn; Samy, Winnie",J Pain Res,,571

Molecular mimicry (structural similarity) between an infecting pathogen and host proteins or pathogenic proteins the host has previously encountered can impact the immune response of the host. The ability to identify potential molecular mimicry for a pathogen can illuminate immune effects with importance to pathogen treatment and vaccine design. SummaryEpitopedia allows for identification of regions with three-dimensional molecular mimicry between a protein in a pathogen with known epitopes in the host.

This study aimed to determine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on MIS in urology practice at national level. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 234 urologists in Turkey participated in an online survey between August 22 and September 23, 2020. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted to determine the participants' demographic characteristics and responses to multiple-choice questions. RESULTS: While 54% of urologists stated that they were concerned about the possibility that the patients planned to undergo MIS were carrying COVID-19 or false-negative for the virus, 51% considered that open surgery was safer than MIS in this regard. The pandemic led to a difference in the preferences of 40% of the urologists in relation to open or MIS methods, and during the pandemic, 39% of the urologists always directed their patients to open surgery. It was determined that during the pandemic, there was a statistical decrease in the intensity and weekly application of MIS methods among all surgical procedures compared to the pre-pandemic (P < .001 and P < .001, respectively). MIS was preferred for oncological operations by 97.3% of the urologists during the pandemic, with the most performed operation being radical nephrectomy (90.7%). Among oncological operations, radical prostatectomy was most frequently postponed. To prevent virus transmission during MIS, 44% of the urologists reported that they always used an additional evacuation system and 52% took additional precautions. There were a total of 27 healthcare workers who took part in MIS and tested positive for COVID-19 after the operation. CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of operations has decreased during the ongoing pandemic, MIS is a method that can be preferred due to its limited contamination and mortality in urology practice provided that safety measures are taken and guideline recommendations are followed.","Danacioglu, Yavuz Onur; Soytas, Mustafa; Polat, Salih; Ozdemir, Osman; Arikan, Ozgur; Yenice, Mustafa Gurkan; Atis, Ramazan Gokhan; Tasci, Ali Ihsan",Int J Clin Pract,,571

514866,Development of Augmented Physics Animation (APA) with the Integration of Crosscutting Concepts about the Covid-19 as a Supplement to the Introductory Physics Course,2021,"Although the psychological and psychiatric implications seem to be a central core of health problems during an emergency, they tend to be underestimated and neglected, generating gaps in intervention strategies and increasing the burden of associated diseases. Moreover, pharmacological treatment concerns arise for psychiatrists and the other specialists who deal with psychiatric patients affected by an infectious disease or with patients with an infectious disease that may develop a number of psychiatric symptoms. The mental health consequences of a pandemic may be related to the sequelae of the disease itself or to the preventive measures aimed at containing the spread of infections. In addition, fear of death, drastic changes in family organization and work routines, closings of schools, companies and public places can play a role. Furthermore, stress derived from working activity or economic losses should not be underestimated. In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, first studies have shown the presence of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia in the general population, health-care workers, and people affected by COVID-19. It appears likely that there will be substantial increases in a broad range of other mental disorders, suicide, behavioral disorders, loneliness, domestic violence and child abuse. From these considerations, the evaluation and monitoring of psychological/psychiatric conditions of involved populations, and the provision of focused aid must be part of the care intervention during the initial stage of a pandemic and beyond. The aim of this review is to summarize the current evidence on how mental health outcomes of COVID-19 outbreak have been measured and managed.

Currently there is a global shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), especially N95 masks. In order to safeguard healthcare personnel in this critical time and to mitigate shortages of N95 respirators, reuse of N95 respirators has to be considered. Methods: Using PubMed and Science Direct, a literature search was conducted to find and synthesize relevant literature on decontamination of N95 respirators for their subsequent reuse. Peer-reviewed publications related to methods of decontamination from January 2007 to April 2020 in the English language are included in this narrative review. Bibliographies of articles for relevant literature were also scrutinized. Findings. A total of 19 studies are included in this narrative review. The appraised methods include ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), moist heat incubation (MHI), ethylene oxide (EtO), hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV), microwave steam bags (MSB), microwave-generated steam (MGS), dry microwave oven irradiation, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (HPGP), dry heat, liquid hydrogen peroxide, and bleach and alcohol. Conclusion: In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, reuse of N95 respirators, although suboptimal, can be considered. Evidence reveals that UVGI, MHI, and HPV are amongst the safest and efficacious methods for decontamination of N95 masks. More research is needed to establish the safety and effectiveness of MGS, MSB, dry heat, EtO, liquid hydrogen peroxide, and HPGP. Alcohol, microwave irradiation, and bleach are not recommended because they damage N95 respirators.","Khan, M A; Ikram, A; Savul, S; Lalani, F K; Sarfraz, M",Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol,,571

516071,Psychology and politics of COVID-19 misinfodemics: Why and how do people believe in misinfodemics?,2020,"Vaccines are a powerful measure to protect the health of individuals and to combat outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. An ethical dilemma arises when one effective vaccine has been successfully developed against an epidemic disease and researchers seek to test the efficacy of another vaccine for the same pathogen in clinical trials involving human subjects. On the one hand, there are compelling reasons why it would be unethical to trial a novel vaccine when an effective product exists already. First, it is a firm principle of medical ethics that an effective treatment or vaccine should not be withheld from patients if their life may depend on it. Second, since epidemic outbreaks often emerge in settings with less-resourced health systems, there is a pronounced risk that any trial withholding an effective vaccine would disproportionately affect the vulnerable populations that historically have been exploited for biomedical research. Third, clinical trials for novel vaccines may be at odds with efforts to control active outbreaks. On the other hand, it may be justified to conduct a trial for a candidate vaccine if it is expected to have certain advantages compared with the existing product. This essay discusses key factors for comparing vaccines against epidemic pathogens, including immunological, logistical and economic considerations. Alongside a case study of the development of vaccines for Ebola, the essay seeks to establish a general framework that should be expanded and populated by immunologists, epidemiologists, economists and bioethicists, and ultimately could be applied to the case of COVID-19 vaccines.","Monrad, Joshua Teperowski",J Med Ethics,,571

Here, we explored 1962 high-quality genomes of early SARS-CoV-2 strains obtained from 42 countries before April 2020. The changing trends of genetic variations in SARS-CoV-2 strains over time and country were subsequently identified. In addition, viral genotype mapping and phylogenetic analysis were performed to identify the variation features of SARS-CoV-2. Results showed that 57.89% of genetic variations involved in ORF1ab, most of which (68.85%) were nonsynonymous. Haplotype maps and phylogenetic tree analysis showed that amino acid variations in ORF1ab (p.5828P > L and p.5865Y > C, also NSP13: P504L and NSP13: Y541C) were the important characteristics of such clade. Furthermore, these variants showed more significant aggregation in the United States (P = 2.92E-66, 95%) than in Australia or Canada, especially in strains from Washington State (P = 1.56E-23, 77.65%). Further analysis demonstrated that the report date of the variants was associated with the date of increased infections and the date of recovery and fatality rate change in the United States. More importantly, the fatality rate in Washington State was higher (4.13%) and showed poorer outcomes (P = 4.12E-21 in fatality rate, P = 3.64E-29 in death and recovered cases) than found in other states containing a small proportion of strains with such variants. Using sequence alignment, we found that variations at the 504 and 541 sites had functional effects on NSP13. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed genetic variations in SARS-CoV-2, gaining insights into amino acid variations in ORF1ab and COVID-19 outcomes.","Cao, Canhui; He, Liang; Tian, Yuan; Qin, Yu; Sun, Haiyin; Ding, Wencheng; Gui, Lingli; Wu, Peng",Infect Genet Evol,,571

Methods: COVID-19 survivors were recruited for high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the thorax, lung function and serum levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody tests 3 months after discharge. The relationship between the clinical characteristics and the pulmonary function or CT scores were investigated. Findings: Fifty-five recovered patients participated in this study. SARS-CoV-2 infection related symptoms were detected in 35 of them and different degrees of radiological abnormalities were detected in 39 patients. Urea nitrogen concentration at admission was associated with the presence of CT abnormalities (P = 0.046, OR 7.149, 95% CI 1.038 to 49.216). Lung function abnormalities were detected in 14 patients and the measurement of D-dimer levels at admission may be useful for prediction of impaired diffusion defect (P = 0.031, OR 1.066, 95% CI 1.006 to 1.129). Of all the subjects, 47 of 55 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG in serum, among which the generation of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody in female patients was stronger than male patients in infection rehabilitation phase. Interpretation: Radiological and physiological abnormalities were still found in a considerable proportion of COVID-19 survivors without critical cases 3 months after discharge. Higher level of D-dimer on admission could effectively predict impaired DLCO after 3 months discharge. It is necessary to follow up the COVID-19 patients to appropriately manage any persistent or emerging long-term sequelae.

METHODS: The hospital registry data were examined of patients aged >65 years who were diagnosed with ACC and COVID-19 between March 2020 and June 2020 and who underwent PC treatment in the interventional radiology unit. RESULTS: A total of 18 patients were diagnosed with ACC and COVID-19, then underwent PC. The patients comprised 14 (78%) males and 4 (22%) females with an average age of 73.4 years (range, 67-81 years). In 17 (94%) patients, symptoms associated with acute cholecystitis decreased within 48-72 h of the PC treatment and a clinical improvement was determined. The success rate of PC was 100% and no complications. In 3 (16.6%) patients followed up with intubation in intensive care after the procedure, mortality developed due to COVID-19-associated pneumonia and subsequent acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 15 (83.4%) patients were discharged with an elective cholecystectomy plan. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection can be fatal especially in patients over 65 years of age due to additional comorbidities. PC treatment, which can be performed under local anesthesia as a minimally invasive procedure, is an alternative treatment option in this patient group. PC can also act as a bridge in transition to elective surgery in this process management.","Çakir, Çaglayan; Kabuli, Hamit Ahmet",Ulus Travma Acil Cerrahi Derg,,571

Given India's unique disease burden including both infectious and chronic diseases, there is a need to study the survival patterns of COVID-19. We aimed to describe the factors associated with COVID-19 deaths in the State of Tamil Nadu that has the highest COVID-19 case burden among the Indian states, and to compare deaths among COVID patients with and without comorbidities. METHODS: We analyzed the first 1000 COVID deaths (1 March to 26 June 2020) and 1000 recent deaths at the time of analysis (1-10 August 2020). We examined data on facility (public vs private), age, gender, duration of illness prior to and/or during hospitalizations, symptoms, comorbidities and cause of death. We used R statistical program to do the analysis. We compared deaths among patients with and without comorbidities using Wilcoxon rank sum test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: First, we found a shorter time interval from onset of symptoms to death in India than that was reported in the USA and China. Second, young adults without comorbidities had shorter survival from the time of onset of symptoms irrespective of their timing of hospitalization. Third, hypothyroidism is a COVID-19 associated co-morbidity. Longitudinal studies are needed to further assess the thyroid-COVID-19 link. CONCLUSION: As COVID-19 infection rates are accelerating rapidly in India, it is crucial to sensitize young adults while protecting the elderly and other vulnerable populations.","Koya, Shaffi F; Ebrahim, Shahul H; Bhat, Lekha D; Vijayan, Bindhya; Khan, Salman; Jose, Soji D; Pilakkadavath, Zarin; Rajeev, Premini; Azariah, Jinbert L",J Epidemiol Glob Health,,571

The cause-specific cumulative incidence, the cause-specific hazard and the subdistribution hazard can be recovered from the regression function. A distinguishing feature of the model is that censoring and competing risks prevent identification at some quantiles. We characterize the set of quantiles for which exact identification is possible and give partial identification results for other quantiles.

AacharaRasayana is advised for the same purpose, which is a code of conduct aimed in providing excellent mental, physical, social and spiritual health without having any medicine. Due to the change in lifestyle and not following the codes of conduct, we are becoming more prone to various diseases. Therefore, it must be implemented in the community to obtain the full span of life without disease. This article explains the Ayurvedic view ofAacharRasayana as a Preventive aspect in COVID-19 like diseases.","Khedekar, Sumod; Rathi, Renu Bharat; Rathi, Bharat J.; Deshmukh, Amit",Int. J. Res.

Our main objective was to identify miRNAs involved in the endothelial function and determine their expression in post-mortem lung biopsies of COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory injuries and thrombotic events. Based on functional enrichment analysis, miR-26a-5p, miR-29b-3p, and miR-34a-5p were identified as regulators of mRNA targets involved in endothelial, and inflammatory signaling pathways as well as in viral diseases. A miRNA/mRNA network, constructed based on protein-protein interactions of the miRNA targets and the inflammatory biomarkers characterized in the patients, revealed a close interconnection of these miRNAs with relevance to the endothelial activation/dysfunction. Reduced expression levels of selected miRNAs were observed in the lung biopsies of COVID-19 patients (n=9) compared to the Controls (n=10)(P<0.01-0.0001). MiR-26a-5p and miR-29b-3p presented the best power to discriminate these groups (AUC=0.8286, and AUC=0.8125, respectively). The correlation analysis of the miRNAs with inflammatory biomarkers in the COVID-19 patients was significant for miR-26a-5p [IL-6 (r2=0.5414), and ICAM-1(r2=0.5624)], and miR-29b-3p [IL-4 (r2=0.8332), and IL-8 (r2=0.2654)].

519218,Pityriasis Rosea in a Confirmed COVID-19 Pediatric Patient./ Pitiriasis rosada en un paciente pediátrico con diagnóstico confirmado de COVID-19,2021,"Background and Purpose: Therapeutic reasoning-the mental process of making judgments and decisions about treatment-is developed through acquisition of knowledge and application in actual or simulated experiences. Health professions education frequently uses collaborative small group work to practice therapeutic reasoning. This pilot study compared the impact of a web-based/mobile tool for collaborative case work and discussion to usual practice on student perceptions and performance on questions designed to test therapeutic knowledge and reasoning. Methods: In a therapeutics course that includes case-based workshops, student teams of 3 to 4 were randomly assigned to usual workshop preparation (group SOAP sheet) or preparation using the Practice Improvement using Virtual Online Training (PIVOT) platform. PIVOT was also used in the workshop to review the case and student responses. The next week, groups crossed over to the other condition. Students rated favorability with the preparatory and in-workshop experiences and provided comments about the PIVOT platform via a survey. Student performance on examination items related to the 2 workshop topics was compared. Results: One hundred and eleven students (94%) completed post-workshop surveys after both workshops. The majority of students (57%) preferred using the PIVOT platform for workshop collaboration. Favorability ratings for the in-workshop experience did not change significantly from first to second study week, regardless of sequence of exposure. There was no relationship between examination item scores and the workshop platform the students were exposed to for that content (P = .29). Student responses highlighted the efficiency of working independently before collaborating as a group and the ability to see other students' thought processes as valuable aspects of PIVOT. Students expressed frustration with the PIVOT user interface and the lack of anonymity when discussing their answers in the workshop. Conclusion: A web-based/mobile platform for student team collaboration on therapeutic reasoning cases discussed in small group settings yielded favorable ratings, examination performance comparable to standard approaches, and was preferred by a majority of students. During the rapid shift to substantial online learning for the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual collaboration tools like PIVOT may help health professions teachers to better support groups working virtually on scaffolded therapeutic reasoning tasks.","Gruenberg, Katherine; Brock, Tina; Garcia, Joshua; MacDougall, Conan",J Med Educ Curric Dev,,571
519226,Carl Schmitt in Hungary: Constitutional crisis in the shadow of covid-19,2021,"Importance: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought forth new challenges for health care workers, such as the daily use of personal protective equipment, including reusable facial respirators. Poor communication while wearing respirators may have fatal complications for patients, and no solution has been proposed to date. Objective: To examine whether use of an in-ear communication device is associated with improved communication while wearing different personal protective equipment (N95 mask, half-face elastomeric respirator, and powered air-purifying respirator [PAPR]) in the operating room. Design, Setting, and Participants: This quality improvement study was conducted in June 2020. Surgical residents from the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, were recruited. All participants had normal hearing, were fluent in English, and had access to the operating rooms at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Exposures: All participants performed the speech intelligibility tasks with and without an in-ear communication device. Main Outcomes and Measures: Speech intelligibility was measured using a word recognition task (Modified Rhyme Test) and a sentence recognition task (AzBio Sentence Test). A percentage correct score (0% to 100%) was obtained for each speech intelligibility test. Listening effort was assessed using the NASA Task Load Index. An overall workload score, ranging from 0 points (low workload) to 100 points (high workload), was obtained. Results: A total of 12 participants were included (mean [SD] age, 31.2 [1.9] years; 8 women [66.7%]). AzBio Sentence Test results revealed that, while wearing the N95 mask, the mean (SD) speech intelligibility was 98.8% (1.8%) without the in-ear device vs 94.3% (7.4%) with the device. While wearing the half-face elastomeric respirator, the mean speech intelligibility was 58.5% (12.4%) without the in-ear device vs 90.8% (8.9%) with the device. While wearing the PAPR, the mean speech intelligibility was 84.6% (9.8%) without the in-ear device vs 94.5% (5.5%) with the device. Use of the in-ear device was associated with a significant improvement in speech intelligibility while wearing the half-face elastomeric respirator (32.3%; 95% CI, 23.8%-40.7%; P < .001) and the PAPR (9.9%; 95% CI, 1.4%-18.3%; P = .01). Furthermore, use of the device was associated with decreased listening effort. The NASA Task Load Index results reveal that, while wearing the N95 mask, the mean (SD) overall workload score was 12.6 (10.6) points without the in-ear device vs 17.6 (9.2) points with the device. While wearing the half-face elastomeric respirator, the mean overall workload score was 67.7 (21.6) points without the in-ear device vs 29.3 (14.4) points with the in-ear device. While wearing the PAPR, the mean overall workload score was 42.2 (18.2) points without the in-ear device vs 23.8 (12.8) points with the in-ear device. Use of the in-ear device was associated with a significant decrease in overall workload score while wearing the half-face elastomeric respirator (38.4; 95% CI, 23.5-53.3; P < .001) and the PAPR (18.4; 95% CI, 0.4-36.4; P = .04). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that among participants using facial respirators that impaired communication, a novel in-ear device was associated with improved communication and decreased listening effort. Such a device may be a feasible solution for protecting health care workers in the operating room while allowing them to communicate safely, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nguyen, Don Luong; Kay-Rivest, Emily; Tewfik, Marc A; Hier, Michael; Lehmann, Alexandre",JAMA Netw Open,,571

The first aim is to adapt the social distancing scale (SDS) into Turkish. The second aim is to test the mediating roles of depression, anxiety, and stress on the relationship between social distance and psychological resilience. The sampling method of the study was revised as the snowball sampling. The study surveyed 843 people (481 female and 362 male) between the ages of 18 and 70 (average age 31.95) living in 51 different cities if Turkey. In the study, back-translation method was used to prepare the SDS-Turkish version. Confirmatory factor analysis results for the study showed that the single-dimension structure fits very well, as in the original form. Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient for the scale was calculated as 0.70. In line with the second aim of the study, the data were tested using a structural equation model analysis. Research results showed that depression, anxiety, and stress have a full mediator role in the relationship between social distancing and resilience for Turkish residents. In other words, this study eliminates social distancing's predictability of resilience by the insertion of the mediatory variable of depression, anxiety, and stress into the structural equation model.","Oral, Tuncay; Gunlu, Aykut",Int J Ment Health Addict,,571

Primary cortical neurons, obtained from embryonic day 15 mice pups, seeded either on PDL- or Matrigel-coated culture ware were investigated by DIC/bright field and fluorescence/confocal microscopy for their morphology, 2D and 3D structure, and distribution patterns. Patch clamp, western blot, and RT-PCR studies were performed to investigate neuronal firing thresholds and sodium channel subtypes Nav1.2 and Nav1.6 expression. Cortical neurons cultured on PDL coating possessed a 2D structure composed of a few numbers of branched and tortuous neurites that contacted with each other in one to one manner, however, neurons on Matrigel coating showed a more complicated dimensional network that depicted tight, linear axonal bundles forming a 3D interacted neuron-astrocyte construction. This difference in growth patterns also showed a significant alteration in neuronal firing threshold which was recorded between 80 < Iinj > 120 pA on PDL and 2 < Iinj > 160 pA on Matrigel. Neurons grown up on Matrigel showed increased levels of sodium channel protein expression of Nav1.2 and Nav1.6 compared to neurons on PDL. These results have demonstrated that a 3D interacted neuron-astrocyte construction on Matrigel enhances the development of Nav1.2 and Nav1.6 in vitro and decreases neuronal firing threshold by 40 times compared to conventional PDL, resembling in vivo neuronal networks and hence would be a better in vitro model of adult neurons.","Karahuseyinoglu, Sercin; Sekerdag, Emine; Aria, Mohammad Mohammadi; Cetin Tas, Yagmur; Nizamoglu, Sedat; Solaroglu, Ihsan; Gürsoy-Özdemir, Yasemin",J. neurochem,,571

With Human Activity Recognition (HAR), applications could track if a patient took his pills and detect the behavioral changes associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's. Current systems for HAR require diverse sensors (e.g., cameras, microphones, proximity sensors, and accelerometers) placed throughout the environment to provide detailed observations needed for high-accuracy HAR. The difficulty of instrumenting an environment with these sensors makes this approach impractical. This project considers whether recent advances in indoor localization (Wi-Fi Round Trip Time) enable high-accuracy HAR using only a smartphone. My design, called Location-Enhanced HAR (LEHAR), uses machine learning to combine acceleration, audio, and location data to detect common human activities. A LEHAR prototype, designed to recognize a dozen common activities conducted in a typical household, achieved an F1-score of 0.965. In contrast, existing approaches, which use only acceleration or audio data, obtained F1-scores of 0.660 and 0.865, respectively, on the same activities. In addition, the F1-score of existing designs dropped significantly as more activities were added for recognition, while LEHAR was able to maintain high accuracy. The results show that using a combination of acceleration, audio, and Wi-Fi Round Trip Time localization can enable a highly accurate and easily deployable HAR system.","Seshan, Arvind",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.06838v1.pdf,571

METHODS: We investigated if disease severity, phenotype or survival in patients with new-onset PD correlates with cNfL concentrations around the time of diagnosis in the population-based NYPUM study cohort (n = 99). A second, larger new-onset PD cohort (n = 194) was used for independent validation. Association of brain pathology with the cNfL concentration was examined using striatal dopamine transporter imaging and repeated diffusion tensor imaging, at baseline, 1 and 3 years. RESULTS: Higher cNfL in the early phase of PD was associated with greater severity of all cardinal motor symptoms except tremor, in both cohorts, and with shorter survival and impaired olfaction. cNfL concentrations above the median of 903 ng/L conferred an overall 5.8 times increased hazard of death, during follow-up. After adjustment for age and sex, higher cNfL correlated with striatal dopamine transporter uptake deficits and lower fractional anisotropy in diffusion tensor imaging of several axonal tracts. CONCLUSIONS: cNfL shows usefulness as a biomarker of disease severity and to predict survival in PD. The present results indicate that the cNfL concentration reflects the intensity of the neurodegenerative process, which could be of importance in future clinical trials. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that in patients with PD, cNFL concentrations are associated with more severe disease and shorter survival.","Bäckström, David; Linder, Jan; Mo, Susanna Jakobson; Riklund, Katrine; Zetterberg, Henrik; Blennow, Kaj; Forsgren, Lars; Lenfeldt, Niklas",Neurology,,571

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic poses one of the greatest global threats in modern history and has already caused severe social and economic costs. The development of efficient and rapid sequencing methods to reconstruct the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, has been fundamental for the design of diagnostic molecular tests and to devise effective measures and strategies to mitigate the diffusion of the pandemic. Diverse approaches and sequencing methods can, as testified by the number of available sequences, be applied to SARS-CoV-2 genomes. However, each technology and sequencing approach has its own advantages and limitations. In the current review, we will provide a brief, but hopefully comprehensive, account of currently available platforms and methodological approaches for the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We also present an outline of current repositories and databases that provide access to SARS-CoV-2 genomic data and associated metadata. Finally, we offer general advice and guidelines for the appropriate sharing and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 data and metadata, and suggest that more efficient and standardized integration of current and future SARS-CoV-2-related data would greatly facilitate the struggle against this new pathogen. We hope that our 'vademecum' for the production and handling of SARS-CoV-2-related sequencing data, will contribute to this objective.","Chiara, Matteo; D039,; Erchia, Anna Maria; Gissi, Carmela; Manzari, Caterina; Parisi, Antonio; Resta, Nicoletta; Zambelli, Federico; Picardi, Ernesto; Pavesi, Giulio; Horner, David S; Pesole, Graziano",Brief. bioinform,,571

523007,[On the possible cures of COVID-19 through therapies not scientifically validated],2020,"BACKGROUND: Social distancing measures are used to reduce the spreading of infection. Our aim was to assess the immediate effects of national lockdown orders due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on pediatric emergency room (ER) visits and respiratory tract infections in hospitals and nationwide in Finland. METHODS: This register-based study used hospital patient information systems and the Finnish national infectious disease register. The participants were all patients visiting pediatric ER in 2 Finnish hospitals (Kuopio University Hospital, Mikkeli Central Hospital) covering 1/5th of the Finnish children population, 4 weeks before and 4 weeks after the start of the nationwide lockdown on March 16, 2020. Nationwide weekly numbers of influenza (A + B) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children were assessed from the infectious disease register from 2015 to 2020. RESULTS: A major decrease in the rate of daily median pediatric ER visits was detected in both hospitals in the study during the nationwide lockdown compared with the study period before the lockdown (Mikkeli, 19 vs. 7, P < 0.001; Kuopio, 9 vs. 2,5, P < 0.001). The influenza season was shorter (8 weeks from peak to no cases), and the weekly rate of new cases decreased faster compared with the previous 4 influenza seasons (previously 15-20 weeks from peak to no cases). A similar decrease was also seen in RSV cases. No pediatric cases of COVID-19 were found in participating hospitals during the study period. CONCLUSION: These results strongly suggest that social distancing and other lockdown strategies are effective to slow down the spreading of common respiratory viral diseases and decreasing the need for hospitalization among children.","Kuitunen, Ilari; Artama, Miia; Mäkelä, Lotta; Backman, Katri; Heiskanen-Kosma, Tarja; Renko, Marjo",Pediatr Infect Dis J,,571

At the beginning of May 2020, 22 out of 70 Belgian soldiers deployed to a military education and training center in Maradi, Niger, developed mild COVID-19 compatible symptoms. Immediately upon their return to Belgium, and two weeks later, all seventy soldiers were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (RT-qPCR) and antibodies (two immunoassays). Nine soldiers had at least one positive COVID-19 diagnostic test result. Five of them exhibited COVID-19 symptoms (mainly anosmia, ageusia, and fever), while four were asymptomatic. In four soldiers, SARS-CoV-2 viral load was detected and the genomes were sequenced. Conventional and genomic epidemiological data suggest that these genomes have an African most recent common ancestor and that the Belgian military service men were infected through contact with locals. The medical military command implemented testing of all Belgian soldiers for SARS-CoV-2 viral load and antibodies, two to three days before their departure on a mission abroad or on the high seas, and for specific missions immediately upon their return in Belgium. Some military operational settings (e.g., training camps in austere environments and ships) were also equipped with mobile infectious disease (COVID-19) testing capacity.","Pirnay, Jean-Paul; Selhorst, Philippe; Cochez, Christel; Petrillo, Mauro; Claes, Vincent; Van der Beken, Yolien; Verbeken, Gilbert; Degueldre, Julie; T039,; Sas, France; Van den Eede, Guy; Weuts, Wouter; Smets, Cedric; Mertens, Jan; Geeraerts, Philippe; Ariën, Kevin K; Neirinckx, Pierre; Soentjens, Patrick",Viruses,,571

524211,COVID-19: Honorarrückgang im privatärztlichen Bereich,2020,"We remain in the midst of the global COVID-19 epidemic. As of November 11th, 2020, cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in 189 countries/regions around the world, with a total of 51,510,611 confirmed cases and more than 1,275,211 deaths, with a global fatality rate of 2.48% (Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Welfare, ROC, 2020b). Therefore, countries are facing lockdown crises and their populations face daily lives full of chaos, anxiety, and reorganization. The characteristics of this epidemic are most often described as ""unprecedented"" and replete with ""uncertainty"" (Davidson et al., 2020). In order to prevent the spread of this virus, health measures such as quarantine, wearing protective masks, and enforced lockdowns have been adopted by governments around the world, producing psychosocial (emotional distress, anxiety, suicide) and economic side-effects (Lima et al., 2020; Montemurro, 2020). Despite its close geographical proximity to China, Taiwan's number of confirmed infections has been relatively small (584 people diagnosed as of November 11th, with 7 total COVID-19-related fatalities; Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Welfare, ROC, 2020b). Taiwan's tragic experience 17 years ago with the SARS epidemic helped prepare the government to respond rapidly to the COVID-19 threat, make thorough preparations and advanced deployments, and formulate relevant anti-epidemic border control measures, quarantine and isolation measures, mask-wearing requirements, and public education strategies. Actions such as mask wearing, washing hands frequently, and practicing proper social distancing by the public and the government maintaining a master travel history, occupation, contact history, and cluster (TOCC) database have proven effective in detecting and diagnosing cases early (Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Welfare, ROC, 2020a; Yang et al., 2020). Furthermore, providing first-line personnel with appropriate protective equipment, education, and training as well as timely and transparent information and epidemic prevention guidelines have kept nurses supplied with appropriate personal protective equipment, infection-prevention and control education, training and exercises, and sufficient professional knowledge and skills to provide care safely to patients (Chen et al., 2020; Huang & Chen, 2020; Yang et al., 2020). Concurrently, it has been a challenge to nursing educators regarding how to suspend classes while not stopping academic education and to plan meaningful, alternative clinical experiences during the pandemic (Morin, 2020) and how to redefine and evaluate student performance to maintain teaching quality and learning effectiveness. In addition, ""disaster nursing"" is a critical area of professional knowledge for nurses in the 21st century, and all nurses should have an appropriate level of competence in professional disaster nursing. Therefore, core concepts related to infection control, disasters, and disaster preparedness should be incorporated into the curriculum and objectives. Finally, although we in Taiwan have faced the COVID-19 challenge in an environment in which the pandemic risk has been relatively well controlled, our daily lives are no longer taken for granted. When we look back on this experience, what will we learn from these experiences and how will this experience change how we approach healthcare and pandemic threats in the future? These changes will bring us more thoughts and challenges in nursing.","Chen, Shu-Ling",Hu Li Za Zhi,,571

From the initial screening, informed consent and recruitment of the participants’ to study completion, the sponsor must undertake a wide array of complex and closely monitored operations, complying with international standards for human subject research and local requirements. Conducting these studies in an underdeveloped country, with limited resources, infrastructure, and experience with regulated clinical trials adds to this complexity. The initial site selection, set up and preparatory activities for the clinical trial are crucial to minimizing the risks to both participants and to successful completion during the subsequent study execution. In this paper, we describe the experience and lessons learned of building clinical trial site capacity in terms of infrastructure and human resource development for a Phase III vaccine clinical trial. We believe that sharing the experience of setting up a clinical trial in a resource-limited country will enable other entities contemplating clinical research in these countries, to prepare and plan ahead, to minimize the impact of barriers, and to contribute to bringing more studies to the countries where people live with the burden of vaccine-preventable, poverty-associated diseases.","Saluja, Tarun; Giri, Bishnu Rath; Chaudhary, Shipra; Tamrakar, Dipesh; Kanodia, Piush; Palkar, Sonali; Vemula, Sridhar; Chinaworapong, Suchada; Kim, Bomi; Gupta, Birendra Prasad; Kyoung Jo, Sue; Aspinall, Sanet; Rai, Ganesh Kumar; Steele, Duncan; Kim, Jerome H.; Wartel, T.

Beclin-1 is an essential scaffold autophagy protein that forms two distinct subcomplexes with modulators Atg14 and UVRAG, responsible for autophagosome formation and maturation, respectively. In the present study, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers an incomplete autophagy response, elevated autophagosome formation but impaired autophagosome maturation, and declined autophagy by genetic knockout of essential autophagic genes reduces SARS-CoV-2 replication efficiency. By screening 28 viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2, we demonstrated that expression of ORF3a alone is sufficient to induce incomplete autophagy. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a interacts with autophagy regulator UVRAG to facilitate Beclin-1-Vps34-Atg14 complex but selectively inhibit Beclin-1-Vps34-UVRAG complex. Interestingly, although SARS-CoV ORF3a shares 72.7% amino acid identity with the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a, the former had no effect on cellular autophagy response. Thus, our findings provide the mechanistic evidence of possible takeover of host autophagy machinery by ORF3a to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 replication and raises the possibility of targeting the autophagic pathway for the treatment of COVID-19.","Qu, Yafei; Wang, Xin; Zhu, Yunkai; Wang, Yuyan; Yang, Xing; Hu, Gaowei; Liu, Chengrong; Li, Jingjiao; Ren, Shanhui; Xiao, Zixuan; Liu, Zhenshan; Wang, Weili; Li, Ping; Zhang, Rong; Liang, Qiming",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.12.380709,571

Therefore, it remains important to identify risk factors for death in critically patients. METHODS: We collected demographic and clinical data on all severe inpatients with COVID-19. We used univariable and multivariable Cox regression methods to determine the independent risk factors related to likelihood of 28-day and 60-day survival, performing survival curve analysis. RESULTS: Of 325 patients enrolled in the study, Multi-factor Cox analysis showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with basic illness (hazard ratio [HR] 6.455, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.658–25.139, P = 0.007), lymphopenia (HR 0.373, 95% CI 0.148–0.944, P = 0.037), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score on admission (HR 1.171, 95% CI 1.013–1.354, P = 0.033) and being critically ill (HR 0.191, 95% CI 0.053–0.687, P = 0.011). Increasing 28-day and 60-day mortality, declining survival time and more serious inflammation and organ failure were associated with lymphocyte count < 0.8 × 109/L, SOFA score > 3, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score > 7, PaO2/FiO2 < 200 mmHg, IL-6 > 120 pg/ml, and CRP > 52 mg/L.

Semi-structured interviews were performed, and data were analysed using thematic analysis. Participants included patients (n = 12) and relatives (n = 5). Three themes emerged: (1) ‘Transport burden’ relates to transition from home-to-hospital-to-home and acknowledges the strain placed on patients and relatives. (2) ‘Role of relatives’ contemplates how the role of families in patient care influences patient preferences. (3) ‘Telemedicine—preferences and concerns’ covers preferences and concerns related to telemedicine in palliative care. The burden of transport and living alone play substantial roles in preferences for place of treatment. Relatives of palliative patients who avail of a day ward and telemedicine may experience an increase in the burden of care. Recognition of concerns pertinent to palliative patients and relatives is an important step in planning new services in palliative care. Concerns may be mitigated by rethinking referral guidelines, incorporating voluntary services, early integration of telemedicine into palliative care and examining patients and relatives’ expectations to care, but requires further research.","Hayes Bauer, Eithne; Ørsted Schultz, Anders Nikolai; Brink, Anette; Oechsle Jørgensen, Lena; Bollig, Georg",Healthcare (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9060758; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34207478/,571

To complicate matters, comorbidities may affect the response to medical treatments currently in use, all of which are still in trial phase. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) merits consideration in the treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients and is an avenue for clinical trials to pursue.

Scarce resources allocation in the COVID-19 outbreak,2020-04-09,"Cryptosporidium and Giardia are two common aetiological agents of infectious enteritis in humans and animals worldwide. These parasitic protists are usually transmitted by the faecal–oral route, following the ingestion of infective stages (oocysts or cysts). An essential component of the control of these parasitic infections, from a public health perspective, is an understanding of the sources and routes of transmission in different geographical regions. Bovines are considered potential sources of infection for humans, because species and genotypes of Cryptosporidium and Giardia infecting humans have also been isolated from cattle in molecular parasitological studies. However, species and genotypes of Cryptosporidium and Giardia of bovids, and the extent of zoonotic transmission in different geographical regions in the world, are still relatively poorly understood. The purpose of this article is to (1) provide a brief background on Cryptosporidium and Giardia, (2) review some key aspects of the molecular epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis in animals, with an emphasis on bovines, (3) summarize research of Cryptosporidium and Giardia from cattle and water buffaloes in parts of Australasia and Sri Lanka, considering public health aspects and (4) provide a perspective on future avenues of study. Recent studies reinforce that bovines harbour Cryptosporidium and Giardia that likely pose a human health risk and highlight the need for future investigations of the biology, population genetics and transmission dynamics of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in cattle, water buffaloes and other ruminants in different geographical regions, the fate and transport of infective stages following their release into the environment, as well as for improved strategies for the control and prevention of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis, guided by molecular epidemiological studies.","Abeywardena, Harshanie; Jex, Aaron R.; Gasser, Robin B.",Adv Parasitol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065308X1500010X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065308X1500010X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25911369/; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.apar.2015.02.001,571

SARS-CoV-2 antibody measurements were assessed as correlates of COVID-19 risk and as correlates of protection. METHODS: Through case-cohort sampling, participants were selected for measurement of four serum antibody markers at Day 1 (first dose), Day 29 (second dose), and Day 57: IgG binding antibodies (bAbs) to Spike, bAbs to Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), and 50% and 80% inhibitory dilution pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titers calibrated to the WHO International Standard (cID50 and cID80). Participants with no evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Cox regression assessed in vaccine recipients the association of each Day 29 or 57 serologic marker with COVID-19 through 126 or 100 days of follow-up, respectively, adjusting for risk factors. RESULTS: Day 57 Spike IgG, RBD IgG, cID50, and cID80 neutralization levels were each inversely correlated with risk of COVID-19: hazard ratios 0.66 (95% CI 0.50, 0.88; p=0.005); 0.57 (0.40, 0.82; p=0.002); 0.42 (0.27, 0.65; p<0.001); 0.35 (0.20, 0.61; p<0.001) per 10-fold increase in marker level, respectively, multiplicity adjusted P-values 0.003–0.010. Results were similar for Day 29 markers (multiplicity adjusted P-values <0.001–0.003). For vaccine recipients with Day 57 reciprocal cID50 neutralization titers that were undetectable (<2.42), 100, or 1000, respectively, cumulative incidence of COVID-19 through 100 days post Day 57 was 0.030 (0.010, 0.093), 0.0056 (0.0039, 0.0080), and 0.0023 (0.0013, 0.0036). For vaccine recipients at these titer levels, respectively, vaccine efficacy was 50.8% (−51.2, 83.0%), 90.7% (86.7, 93.6%), and 96.1% (94.0, 97.8%). Causal mediation analysis estimated that the proportion of vaccine efficacy mediated through Day 29 cID50 titer was 68.5% (58.5, 78.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Binding and neutralizing antibodies correlated with COVID-19 risk and vaccine efficacy and likely have utility in predicting mRNA-1273 vaccine efficacy against COVID-19.

594180,Exploring short term spatio-temporal pattern of PM(2.5) and PM(10) and their relationship with meteorological parameters during COVID-19 in Delhi,2021-08-06,"SARS-CoV-2 is spreading around the world for the past year. Enormous efforts have been taken to understand its mechanism of transmission. It is well established now that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its first step of entry. Being a single-stranded RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 is evolving rapidly. Recently, several variants such as B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1, with a key mutation N501Y on the RBD, appear to be more infectious to humans. To understand its mechanism, we combined cell surface binding assay, kinetics study, single-molecule technique, and computational method to investigate the interaction between these RBD (mutations) and ACE2. Remarkably, RBD with the N501Y mutation exhibited a considerably stronger interaction characterized from all these methodologies, while the other two mutations from B.1.351 contributed to a less effect. Fluorescence-activated cell scan (FACS) assays found that RBD N501Y mutations are of higher binding affinity to ACE2 than the wild type. Surface plasmon resonance further indicated that N501Y mutation had a faster association rate and slower dissociation rate. Consistent with the kinetics study, atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule force microscopy quantify their strength on living cells, showing a higher binding probability and unbinding force for the mutation. Finally, Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) simulations on the dissociation of RBD-ACE2 complexes revealed that the N501Y introduced additional π-π and π-cation interaction for the higher force/interaction. Taken together, we suggested that the reinforced interaction from N501Y mutation in RBD should play an essential role in the higher transmission of COVID-19 variants.","Tian, Fang; Tong, Bei; Sun, Liang; Shi, Shengchao; Zheng, Bin; Wang, Zibin; Dong, Xianchi; Zheng, Peng",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.14.431117,571

Such secreted proteins, which are thought to be delivered by haustoria, conceivably reprogram host cells and instigate structural modifications, in addition to the modulation of various cellular processes. As effectors represent tools to assist disease resistance breeding, this short review provides a bird’s eye view on the relationship between the virulence function of effectors and their subcellular localization in host cells.","Chaudhari, Prateek; Ahmed, Bulbul; Joly, David L; Germain, Hugo",Virulence,https://doi.org/10.4161/viru.29652; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25513771/,571

We show in a retrospective analysis how this method can be applied at an early stage in the mbox{COVID-19} epidemic to forecast its subsequent spread and onset in different geographic regions, with minimal parameterization of the model. This provides insight into the role of near real-time aggregate mobility data in disease spread modeling by quantifying substantial changes in how populations move both locally and globally.

Here, we generate a pan-human coronavirus programmable phage display assay to perform proteome-wide profiling of coronavirus antigens enriched by 98 COVID-19 patient sera. Next, we employ ReScan, a method to efficiently sequester phage expressing the most immunogenic peptides and print them onto paper-based microarrays using acoustic liquid handling, which isolates and identifies 9 candidate antigens, 8 of which are derived from the 2 proteins used for SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays: spike and nucleocapsid proteins. After deployment in a high-throughput assay amenable to clinical lab settings, these antigens show improved specificity over a whole protein panel. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that ReScan will have broad applicability for other emerging infectious diseases or autoimmune diseases that lack a valid biomarker, enabling a seamless pipeline from antigen discovery to diagnostic using one recombinant protein source.","Zamecnik, Colin R; Rajan, Jayant V; Yamauchi, Kevin A; Mann, Sabrina A; Loudermilk, Rita P; Sowa, Gavin M; Zorn, Kelsey C; Alvarenga, Bonny D; Gaebler, Christian; Caskey, Marina; Stone, Mars; Norris, Philip J; Gu, Wei; Chiu, Charles Y; Ng, Dianna; Byrnes, James R; Zhou, Xin X; Wells, James A; Robbiani, Davide F; Nussenzweig, Michel C; DeRisi, Joseph L; Wilson, Michael R",Cell reports.

Clinical evidence suggests that the intestine is another high-risk organ for SARS-CoV-2 infection besides the lungs. However, a model that can accurately reflect the response of the human intestine to the virus is still lacking. Here, we created an intestinal infection model on a chip that allows the recapitulation of human relevant intestinal pathophysiology induced by SARS-CoV-2 at organ level. This microengineered gut-on-chip reconstitutes the key features of the intestinal epithelium-vascular endothelium barrier through the three-dimensional (3D) co-culture of human intestinal epithelial, mucin-secreting, and vascular endothelial cells under physiological fluid flow. The intestinal epithelium showed permissiveness for viral infection and obvious morphological changes with injury of intestinal villi, dispersed distribution of mucus-secreting cells, and reduced expression of tight junction (E-cadherin), indicating the destruction of the intestinal barrier integrity caused by virus. Moreover, the vascular endothelium exhibited abnormal cell morphology, with disrupted adherent junctions. Transcriptional analysis revealed abnormal RNA and protein metabolism, as well as activated immune responses in both epithelial and endothelial cells after viral infection (e.g., upregulated cytokine genes), which may contribute to the injury of the intestinal barrier associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. This human organ system can partially mirror intestinal barrier injury and the human response to viral infection, which is not possible in existing in vitro culture models. It provides a unique and rapid platform to accelerate COVID-19 research and develop novel therapies.","Guo, Yaqiong; Luo, Ronghua; Wang, Yaqing; Deng, Pengwei; Song, Tianzhang; Zhang, Min; Wang, Peng; Zhang, Xu; Cui, Kangli; Tao, Tingting; Li, Zhongyu; Chen, Wenwen; Zheng, Yongtang; Qin, Jianhua",Sci Bull (Beijing),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scib.2020.11.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33282445/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095927320307210?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095927320307210,571

We aimed to develop and validate a widely applicable nomogram for the prediction of 180-day readmission to the patients. Methods: We prospectively enrolled 2,980 consecutive patients with CHF from two hospitals. A nomogram was created to predict 180-day readmission based on the selected variables. The patients were divided into three datasets for development, internal validation, and external validation (mean age: 74.2 ± 14.1, 73.8 ± 14.2, and 71.0 ± 11.7 years, respectively; sex: 50.2, 48.8, and 55.2% male, respectively). At baseline, 102 variables were submitted to the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression algorithm for variable selection. The selected variables were processed by the multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression modeling combined with univariate analysis and stepwise regression. The model was evaluated by the concordance index (C-index) and calibration plot. Finally, the nomogram was provided to visualize the results. The improvement in the regression model was calculated by the net reclassification index (NRI) (with tenfold cross-validation and 200 bootstraps). Results: Among the selected 2,980 patients, 1,696 (56.9%) were readmitted within 180 days, and 1,502 (50.4%) were men. A nomogram was established by the results of Lasso regression, univariate analysis, stepwise regression and multivariate Cox regression, as well as variables with clinical significance. The values of the C-index were 0.75 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.72–0.79], 0.75 [95% CI: 0.69–0.81], and 0.73 [95% CI: 0.64–0.83] for the development, internal validation, and external validation datasets, respectively. Calibration plots were provided for both the internal and external validation sets. Five variables including history of acute heart failure, emergency department visit, age, blood urea nitrogen level, and beta blocker usage were considered in the final prediction model. When adding variables involving hospital discharge way, alcohol taken and left bundle branch block, the calculated values of NRI demonstrated no significant improvements. Conclusions: A nomogram for the prediction of 180-day readmission of patients with CHF was developed and validated based on five variables. The proposed methodology can improve the accurate prediction of patient readmission and have the wide applications for CHF.","Gao, Shanshan; Yin, Gang; Xia, Qing; Wu, Guihai; Zhu, Jinxiu; Lu, Nan; Yan, Jingyi; Tan, Xuerui",Front Cardiovasc Med,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2021.731730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34557533/,571

In the present study, we analyzed the spectrum of immune responses of mice to three different forms of the SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid (N): (1) exogenous recombinant protein (N-GST) with Freund's adjuvant; (2) DNA encoding unmodified N as an endogenous cytoplasmic protein (pN); and (3) DNA encoding N as a LAMP-1 chimera targeted to the lysosomal MHC II compartment (p-LAMP-N). Lysosomal trafficking of the LAMP/N chimera in transfected cells was documented by both confocal and immunoelectron microscopy. The responses of the immunized mice differed markedly. The strongest T-cell IFN-γ and CTL responses were to the LAMP-N chimera followed by the pN immunogen. In contrast, N-GST elicited strong T cell IL-4 but minimal IFN-γ responses and a much greater antibody response. Despite these differences, however, the immunodominant T-cell ELISpot responses to each of the three immunogens were elicited by the same N peptides, with the greatest responses being generated by a cluster of five overlapping peptides, N(76–114), each of which contained nonameric H2(d) binding domains with high binding scores for both class I and, except for N(76–93), class II alleles. These results demonstrate that processing and presentation of N, whether exogenously or endogenously derived, resulted in common immunodominant epitopes, supporting the usefulness of modified antigen delivery and trafficking forms and, in particular, LAMP chimeras as vaccine candidates. Nevertheless, the profiles of T-cell responses were distinctly different. The pronounced Th-2 and humoral response to N protein plus adjuvant are in contrast to the balanced IFN-γ and IL-4 responses and strong memory CTL responses to the LAMP-N chimera.","Gupta, Vandana; Tabiin, Tani M.; Sun, Kai; Chandrasekaran, Ananth; Anwar, Azlinda; Yang, Kun; Chikhlikar, Priya; Salmon, Jerome; Brusic, Vladimir; Marques, Ernesto T.A.; Kellathur, Srinivasan N.; August, Thomas J.",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004268220500783X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16387339/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268220500783X,571

Small intestinal bacterial contamination and tropical enteropathy could trigger inflammatory stimuli and activate the endothelium in the portal venous system. Groundwater contaminated with arsenic is an environmental factor of epidemic proportions in large areas of India which has similar consequences. Von Willebrand factor (a sticky protein) expressed by activated endothelium may promote formation of platelet microthrombi and occlusion of intrahepatic portal vein branches leading to NCIPH. Environmental factors linked to suboptimal hygiene and sanitation, which enter through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, predispose to platelet plugging onto activated endothelium in portal microcirculation. Thus, NCIPH, an example of poverty linked thrombophilia, is a disease mainly affecting the lower socio-economic strata of Indian population.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-coronavirus (CoV) spread first in southern China in 2003 with about 8000 infected cases in few months. Then in 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) emerged from the Arabian Peninsula giving a still on-going epidemic associated to a high fatality rate. CoVs are thus considered a major health threat. This is especially true as no vaccine nor specific therapeutic are available against either SARS- or MERS-CoV. Therefore, new drugs need to be identified in order to develop antiviral treatments limiting CoV replication. In this study, we focus on the nsp14 protein, which plays a key role in virus replication as it methylates the RNA cap structure at the N7 position of the guanine. We developed a high-throughput N7-MTase assay based on Homogenous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF(®)) and screened chemical libraries (2000 compounds) on the SARS-CoV nsp14. 20 compounds inhibiting the SARS-CoV nsp14 were further evaluated by IC(50) determination and their specificity was assessed toward flavivirus- and human cap N7-MTases. Our results reveal three classes of compounds: 1) molecules inhibiting several MTases as well as the dengue virus polymerase activity unspecifically, 2) pan MTases inhibitors targeting both viral and cellular MTases, and 3) inhibitors targeting one viral MTase more specifically showing however activity against the human cap N7-MTase.

STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-country study of plausible associations between COVID-19 mortality and the proportion of overweight among adults, controlling for age, gender, and income. METHODS: Parametric and non-parametric regression analysis. RESULTS: We observe a statistically significant positive association between COVID-19 mortality and the proportion of the overweight in adult populations spanning 154 countries. This association holds across countries belonging to different income groups and is not sensitive to a population's median age, proportion of the elderly, and/or proportion of females. The estimated elasticities of COVID-19 mortality, with respect to the proportion of the overweight in adult populations, are consistently higher for sub-samples of countries that belong to a higher income group. On an average, every percentage point increment in the proportion of the overweight in adult populations contributes to an additional 3.5% points to COVID-19 mortality for high income countries: the limits of confidence intervals around this point estimate range between 1.5 and 5.4. CONCLUSIONS: A positive association between COVID-19 mortality and the proportion of the overweight in a country's adult population is robust, subject to alterations in the conditioning information set on age, gender, and income. Our findings call for an effective alignment of public policy regulations with public health priorities.","Arulanandam, Bernard; Beladi, Hamid; Chakrabarti, Avik",Public Health Pract (Oxf),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhip.2021.100179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34485959/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266653522100104X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S266653522100104X,571

The types of rapid learning envisioned to address Covid‐19 and future public health crises require a systems approach that enables sharing of data and lessons learned at scale. Agreement on a systems approach augmented by technology and standards will be foundational to making such learning meaningful and to ensuring its scientific integrity. With this purpose in mind, a group of individuals from Spain, Italy, and the United States have formed a transatlantic collaboration, with the aim of generating a proposed comprehensive standards‐based systems approach and data‐driven framework for collection, management, and analysis of high‐quality data. This framework will inform decisions in managing clinical responses and social measures to overcome the Covid‐19 global pandemic and to prepare for future public health crises. We first argue that standardized data of the type now common in global regulated clinical research is the essential fuel that will power a global system for addressing (and preventing) current and future pandemics. We then present a blueprint for a system that will put these data to use in driving a range of key decisions. In the context of this system, we describe and categorize the specific types of data the system will require for different purposes and document the standards currently in use for each of these categories in the three nations participating in this work. In so doing, we anticipate some of the challenges to harmonizing these data but also suggest opportunities for further global standardization and harmonization. While we have scaled this transnational effort to three nations, we hope to stimulate an international dialogue with a culmination of realizing such a system.","Ros, Francisco; Kush, Rebecca; Friedman, Charles; Gil Zorzo, Esther; Rivero Corte, Pablo; Rubin, Joshua C.; Sanchez, Borja; Stocco, Paolo; Van Houweling, Douglas",Learn Health Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33349796/; https://doi.org/10.1002/lrh2.10253,571

In this study, we prepared and vaccinated mice with either a Spike (S) protein or inactivated whole MERS-CoV (IV) with a combined adjuvant (alum+CpG) as a vaccine formulation. Similar levels of the anti-S protein IgG response and neutralizing activity were induced by both the S protein and IV vaccines. In addition, immune responses against three other structural proteins, the envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, were also detected in sera of mice that received IV. No antigen-specific T-cell immunity was detected after vaccination based on the interferon-γ ELISpot assay. Mice were transduced with Ad5-hDPP4 after the final immunization and were then challenged with MERS-CoV (1 × 10(5) plaque-forming units). Compared with the control group (adjuvant alone), mice immunized with the S protein or IV showed slightly lower pathological damage in the lung, as well as reduced antigen expression and lung virus titers. Mice that received IV formulations also showed increased protective immunity (almost no live virus was isolated from the lung). In conclusion, our data indicate that immunization with our IV formulation induced enhanced protection in mice compared to immunization with the S protein against MERS-CoV, which should be further tested in camels and clinical trials.","Deng, Yao; Lan, Jiaming; Bao, Linlin; Huang, Baoying; Ye, Fei; Chen, Yingzhu; Yao, Yanfeng; Wang, Wenling; Qin, Chuan; Tan, Wenjie",Emerg Microbes Infect,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41426-018-0056-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29618723/,571

600537,Assessing Differential Impacts of COVID-19 on Black Communities,2020-05-08,"RATIONALE: Since the end of December 2019, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has occurred and spread rapidly throughout China. At present, China's epidemic situation has been basically controlled, but the number of cases worldwide is increasing day by day. On March 11, the WHO officially announced that the COVID-19 had become a global pandemic. However, there are currently limited data on pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia and their infants. In this paper, a case of a pregnant woman infected with COVID-19 pneumonia is reported. PATIENT CONCERNS: We report a clinically confirmed COVID-19 pregnant woman. The patient was tested negative 4 times in nucleic acid test, but immunoglobulin G was positive and immunoglobulin M was negative before delivery, suggesting a previous infection. DIAGNOSES: The pregnant woman underwent a computed tomography scan of both lungs at 29 + 2 weeks of pregnancy, and scattered stiffness and frosted glass shadows of both lungs were observed. According to the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 pneumonia in the “New Coronavirus Prevention and Control Plan Fifth Edition” of the National Health Commission of China, she was diagnosed as a clinically confirmed case. INTERVENTIONS: The pregnant women received nebulized inhalation and oral cephalosporin treatment in a community hospital and was discharged after the symptoms disappeared. After that, she was isolated at home. OUTCOMES: The pregnant woman gave birth to a healthy baby after being cured from COVID-19 infection. The nucleic acid test of the neonatal pharyngeal swab was negative, and the neonatal serum test showed positive for immunoglobulin G and negative for immunoglobulin M. LESSONS SUBSECTIONS: The findings of this case report are useful for understanding the possible clinical features of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women, the duration of the antibody, and passive immunity of the fetus.","Peng, Jing; Li, Ruobing; Yin, Heng; Tang, Fei; Xie, Hui; Li, Min; Zhao, Yun",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32791731/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000021335,571
600579,Discrete simulation analysis of COVID-19 and prediction of isolation bed numbers,2021-06-23,"PURPOSE: Exercise at home and improvement in the ability to undertake daily tasks are highly valued by older people after hospitalisation. New telerehabilitation (TR) technologies make it possible to supervise and communicate with exercising participants through videoconferencing equipment. This technology has been shown to be both feasible and effective in Danish chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients in terms of basic mobility, safety, social interactions and patient perception. This study sought to examine whether it was feasible to carry out TR through home exercises in groups. METHODS: Both medical and hip-fracture home-dwelling patients aged 65 years and older admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) and Department of Geriatrics for acute reasons were asked to participate in the study just before their discharge. The inclusion criteria were normal cognitive function, being dependent on a walking aid and computer users before hospitalisation. RESULTS: At discharge, 333 patients were consecutively screened for participation. Of those, 300 patients were excluded. Thirty-three patients met the inclusion criteria. They had a mean age of 82.3 years (± 7.8) and 76% were women. Nine patients agreed to participate, but seven withdrew. The most frequent explanation was exhaustion in the continuation of hospitalisation. CONCLUSION: It was not possible to conduct a videoconference TR study in a geriatric population, as many were excluded and those who were eligible withdrew after inclusion. During the COVID-19 pandemic, TR may be an important tool for isolated older persons to hinder functional decline. Aspects such as recruitment procedures and IT solutions designed for older people must be considered.","Jørgensen, Bodil B.; Gregersen, Merete; Pallesen, Søren Holm; Damsgaard, Else Marie",Eur Geriatr Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33544388/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s41999-020-00444-6,571

Pooling samples can increase the number of tests processed. LabTurbo AIO 48 is an automated platform that allows ribonucleic acid extraction and sample analysis on the same instrument. We created a novel pooling assay on this platform for SARS-CoV-2 detection and demonstrated that the pooling strategy increases testing capacity without affecting accuracy and sensitivity. Methods Comparative limit of detection (LoD) assessment was performed on the LabTurbo AIO 48 platform and the current standard detection system based on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) using 55 clinically positive samples. An additional 330 primary clinical samples were assessed. Results Six samples pooled into one reaction tube were detected in approximately 2.5 h using the World Health Organization rRT-PCR protocol. LabTurbo AIO 48 also demonstrated a higher throughput than our reference rRT-PCR assay, with an LoD of 1000 copies/mL. The overall percentage agreement between the methods for the 330 samples was 100%. Conclusion We created a novel multi-specimen pooling assay using LabTurbo AIO 48 for the robust detection of SARS-CoV-2, allowing high-throughput results; this assay will aid in better control and prevention of COVID-19. The diagnostic assay was cost-effective and time-efficient; thus, the pooling strategy is a practical and effective method for diagnosing large quantities of specimens without compromising precision.","Chung, Hsing-Yi; Jian, Ming-Jr; Chang, Chih-Kai; Lin, Jung-Chung; Yeh, Kuo-Ming; Chen, Chien-Wen; Yang, Ya-Sung; Hsieh, Shan-Shan; Chen, En-Sung; Yang, Mei-Hsiu; Tang, Sheng-Hui; Perng, Cherng-Lih; Yang, Ji-Rong; Liu, Ming-Tsan; Chang, Feng-Yee; Shang, Hung-Sheng",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118221001705?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1684118221001705; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2021.08.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34538568/,571

Prediction about the number of infected and death cases may help to take immediate action to prevent the epidemic as well as control the situation of a country. The ongoing debate about the climate factors may need more validation with more studies. The climate factors of the top-five affected countries and three south Asian countries have considered in this study to have a real-time forecast and robust validation about the impact of climate variables. Methods: The ARIMA model have included to model the univariate cumulative confirmed and death cases separately. The MLP, ELM and likelihood-based GLM count time series also considered as they consider the external variables as exogenous regressors. As the death count includes zero itself, zero-inflated count time series model has included instead of likelihood-based GLM.

602586,Introduction to the special series: translating behavioral medicine research to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19,2020-09-21,"BACKGROUND: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) presents a unique clinical challenge. Affecting joints, skin, nails, and other organs, it is associated with various comorbidities and has a significant impact on quality of life, social participation and working life. While biologic and other targeted synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs and tsDMARDs) have revolutionised therapy, questions remain about the long-term safety of these agents, and their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in the real-world clinical setting. METHODS/DESIGN: The British Society for Rheumatology Psoriatic Arthritis Register (BSR-PsA) is a prospective registry of patients with PsA, recruited from across Great Britain, who are (a) commencing a bDMARD/tsDMARD; or (b) naïve to all bDMARDs/tsDMARDs. Ethical approval was given by the NHS West of Scotland Research Ethics Committee 3 (reference: 18/WS/0126). Clinical data are extracted from participants’ medical records, including symptom onset and diagnosis, joint, skin and nail symptoms, dactylitis and enthesitis. Physical measurements (height, weight and 66/68 joint counts) and a detailed drug history are taken. Participants are also asked to complete questionnaires comprising instruments relating to general health and quality of life, axial disease, sleep and fatigue, impact of disease, functional status, mental health, other symptoms, and occupational status. The study duration is 5 years in the first instance, and all participants are followed up annually until the end of the study. Participants commencing a bDMARD/tsDMARD are also followed up three and six months after the start of therapy. Disease activity, including C-reactive protein, is assessed at each visit; and participants from some centres are invited to donate blood and urine samples for the creation of a biobank. DISCUSSION: Complementing data from randomised trials, results from this study will contribute to the evidence base underpinning the clinical management of psoriatic arthritis. Various analyses will determine the effectiveness and safety of bDMARDs/tsDMARDs in the real-world, will examine the clinical and biological predictors of treatment response, and will provide real-world data on the cost-effectiveness of these therapies, as well as providing informative data important to patients such as quality of life and occupational outcomes.

Each month, CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) monitors the prevalence of health-related workplace absenteeism among currently employed full-time workers in the United States, overall and by demographic and occupational subgroups, using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS).* This report describes trends in absenteeism during October 2019-April 2020, including March and April 2020, the period of rapidly accelerating transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Overall, the prevalence of health-related workplace absenteeism in March and April 2020 were similar to their 5-year baselines. However, compared with occupation-specific baselines, absenteeism among workers in several occupational groups that define or contain essential critical infrastructure workforce† categories was significantly higher than expected in April. Significant increases in absenteeism were observed in personal care and service§ (includes child care workers and personal care aides); healthcare support¶; and production** (includes meat, poultry, and fish processing workers). Although health-related workplace absenteeism remained relatively unchanged or decreased in other groups, the increase in absenteeism among workers in occupational groups less able to avoid exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (3) highlights the potential impact of COVID-19 on the essential critical infrastructure workforce because of the risks and concerns of occupational transmission of SARS-CoV-2. More widespread and complete collection of occupational data in COVID-19 surveillance is required to fully understand workers' occupational risks and inform intervention strategies. Employers should follow available recommendations to protect workers' health.","Groenewold, Matthew R.; Burrer, Sherry L.; Ahmed, Faruque; Uzicanin, Amra; Free, Hannah; Luckhaupt, Sara E.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32644979/; https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6927a1,571

OBJECTIVE: We examined the temporal association between the county-level Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a percentile-based measure of social vulnerability to disasters, its subcomponents and race/ethnic composition with COVID-19 incidence and mortality in the U.S. in the year starting in March 2020. METHODS: Counties (n=3091) with ≥ 50 COVID-19 cases by March 6(th), 2021 were included in the study. Associations between SVI (and its subcomponents) and county level racial composition with the incidence and death per capita were assessed by fitting a negative-binomial mixed-effects model. This model was also used to examine potential time varying associations between weekly number of cases/deaths and SVI or racial composition. Data was adjusted for percentage of population aged ≥65 years, state level testing rate, comorbidities using the average Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) score, and environmental factors including average fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)), temperature and precipitation. RESULTS: Higher SVI, indicative of greater social vulnerability, was independently associated with higher COVID-19 incidence (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] per-10 percentile increase:1.02, (95% CI 1.02, 1.03, p<0.001), and death per capita (1.04, (95% CI 1.04, 1.05, p<0.001). SVI became an independent predictor of incidence starting from March 2020, but this association became weak or insignificant by the winter, a period that coincided with a sharp increase in infection rates and mortality, and when counties with higher proportion of White residents were disproportionately represented (“third wave”). By Spring of 2021, SVI was again a predictor of COVID-19 outcomes. Counties with greater proportion of Black residents also observed similar temporal trends COVID-19-related adverse outcomes. Counties with greater proportion of Hispanic residents had worse outcomes throughout the duration of the analysis. CONCLUSION: Except for the winter “third wave” when majority White communities had the highest incidence of cases, counties with greater social vulnerability and proportionately higher minority populations, experienced worse COVID-19 outcomes.","Islam, Shabatun J.; Nayak, Aditi; Hu, Yingtian; Mehta, Anurag; Dieppa, Katherine; Almuwaqqat, Zakaria; Ko, Yi-An; Patel, Shivani A.; Goyal, Abhinav; Sullivan, Samaah; Lewis, Tené T.; Vaccarino, Viola; Morris, Alanna A.; Quyyumi, Arshed A.",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.04.21258355v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.04.21258355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34127982/,571
603891,JUE Insight: College student travel contributed to local COVID-19 spread(),2020-12-04,"BACKGROUND: The Acute Medical Unit (AMU) provides care for unscheduled hospital admissions. Seven-day Consultant presence and morning AMU discharges have been advocated to improve hospital bed management. AIMS: To determine whether a later time of daily peak AMU occupancy correlates with measures of hospital stress; whether seven-day Consultant presence, for COVID-19, abolished weekly periodicity of discharges. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis METHODS: Anonymised AMU admission and discharge times were retrieved from the Profile Information Management System (PIMS), at a large, urban hospital from 14(th) April 2014—31(st) December 2018 and 20(th) March—2(nd) May 2020 (COVID-19 peak). Minute-by-minute admission and discharge times were combined to construct a running total of AMU bed occupancy. Fourier transforms were used to determine periodicity. We tested association between i) average AMU occupancy and ii) time of peak AMU occupancy, with measures of hospital stress (total medical bed occupancy and ‘medical outliers’ on non-medical wards). RESULTS: Daily, weekly and seasonal patterns of AMU bed occupancy were evident. Timing of AMU peak occupancy was unrelated to each measure of hospital stress: total medical inpatients (Spearman’s rho, r(s)=0.04, P = 0.24); number of medical outliers (r(s)=-0.06, P = 0.05). During COVID-19, daily bed occupancy was similar, with continuation of greater Friday and Monday discharges than the weekend. CONCLUSIONS: Timing of peak AMU occupancy did not alter with hospital stress. Efforts to increase morning AMU discharges are likely to have little effect on hospital performance. Seven-day Consultant presence did not abolish weekly periodicity of discharges – other factors influence weekend discharges.","Dauncey, S J; Kelly, P A; Baykov, D; Skeldon, A C; Whyte, M B",QJM,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33394049/; https://doi.org/10.1093/qjmed/hcaa334,571
604601,Meaning-Making Through Creativity During COVID-19,2020-12-18,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease with first symptoms similar to the flu. COVID-19 appeared first in China and very quickly spreads to the rest of the world, causing then the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic. In many cases, this disease causes pneumonia. Since pulmonary infections can be observed through radiography images, this paper investigates deep learning methods for automatically analyzing query chest X-ray images with the hope to bring precision tools to health professionals towards screening the COVID-19 and diagnosing confirmed patients. In this context, training datasets, deep learning architectures and analysis strategies have been experimented from publicly open sets of chest X-ray images. Tailored deep learning models are proposed to detect pneumonia infection cases, notably viral cases. It is assumed that viral pneumonia cases detected during an epidemic COVID-19 context have a high probability to presume COVID-19 infections. Moreover, easy-to-apply health indicators are proposed for estimating infection status and predicting patient status from the detected pneumonia cases. Experimental results show possibilities of training deep learning models over publicly open sets of chest X-ray images towards screening viral pneumonia. Chest X-ray test images of COVID-19 infected patients are successfully diagnosed through detection models retained for their performances. The efficiency of proposed health indicators is highlighted through simulated scenarios of patients presenting infections and health problems by combining real and synthetic health data.","Hammoudi, Karim; Benhabiles, Halim; Melkemi, Mahmoud; Dornaika, Fadi; Arganda-Carreras, Ignacio; Collard, Dominique; Scherpereel, Arnaud",J Med Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34101042/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10916-021-01745-4,571

605499,Assessment of clinical outcomes in renal transplant recipients with COVID‐19,2021-08-23,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Anlotinib is a newly developed small molecule multiple receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that was approved for the treatment of patients with lung cancer in China. We aim to report 3 cases of rare complication of anlotinib-bronchial fistula (BF) during the treatment of lung cancer patients and summarize the possible causes. METHODS: We collected three patients who developed BF due to anlotinib treatment, and conducted a search of Medline and PubMed for medical literature published between 2018 and 2020 using the following search terms: ""anlotinib, "" ""lung cancer, "" and ""fistula."" RESULTS: Our literature search produced two case reports (three patients) which, in addition to our three patients. We collated the patients' clinical characteristics including demographic information, cancer type, imaging features, treatment received, risk factors for anlotinib related BF, and treatment-related outcomes. The six patients shared some common characteristics: advanced age, male, concurrent infection symptoms, diabetes mellitus (DM), advanced squamous cell and small cell lung cancers, centrally located tumors, tumor measuring ≥5 cm in longest diameter, and newly formed tumor cavitation after multi-line treatment especially after receiving radiotherapy. Fistula types included broncho-pericardial fistula, broncho-pleural fistula, and esophago-tracheobronchial fistula. Six patients all died within 6 months. CONCLUSION: Although anlotinib is relatively safe, it is still necessary to pay attention to the occurrence of BF, a rare treatment side effect that threatens the quality of life and overall survival of patients. Anlotinib, therefore, requires selective use and close observation of high-risk patients.","DENG, Pengbo; HU, Chengping; LI, Yuanyuan; CAO, Liming; YANG, Huaping; LI, Min; AN, Jian; JIANG, Juan; GU, Qihua",Zhongguo Fei Ai Za Zhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32987493/; https://doi.org/10.3779/j.issn.1009-3419.2020.102.40,571

They are fundamental to understanding pathogenesis and devising better therapeutic and prevention strategies. In this report we present within-host modelling to examine the viral load dynamics observed in the upper respiratory tract, drawing upon 2172 serial measurements from 605 subjects, collected from 17 different studies. We developed a mechanistic within-host model to describe viral load dynamics and host response, and also contrasted simpler mixed-effects regression analysis of peak viral load and its subsequent decline. The inclusion of age, sex, or disease severity of the subjects did not appreciably improve the fit of either the mechanistic model or the regression. In future work, this model will be used to connect viral load dynamics to underlying host traits, to better understand these complex interactions.","Challenger, J. D.; Foo, C.

This study describes the impact of the pandemic on incidences and deaths in LTCF across England. METHODS Laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in England, notified to Public Health England from 01 Jan to 25 Dec 2020, were address-matched to an Ordnance Survey reference database to identify residential property classifications. Data were analysed to characterize cases and identify clusters. Associated deaths were defined as death within 60 days of diagnosis or certified as cause of death. RESULTS Of 1 936 315 COVID-19 cases, 81 275 (4.2%) and 10 050 (0.52%) were identified as resident or staff in an LTCF, respectively, with 20 544 associated deaths in residents, accounting for 31.3% of all COVID-19 deaths. Cases were identified in 69.5% of all LTCFs in England, with 33.1% experiencing multiple outbreaks. Multivariable analysis showed a 67% increased odds of death in residents [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.67, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.63-1.72], compared with those not residing in LTCFs. A total of 10 321 outbreaks were identified at these facilities, of which 8.2% identified the first case as a staff member. CONCLUSIONS Over two-thirds of LTCFs have experienced large and widespread outbreaks of COVID-19, and just under one-third of all COVID-19 deaths occurring in this setting in spite of early policies. A key implication of our findings is upsurges in community incidences seemingly leading to increased outbreaks in LTCFs; thus, identifying and shielding residents from key sources of infection are vital to reduce the number of future outbreaks.","Chudasama, Dimple Y; Milbourn, Hannah; Nsonwu, Olisaeloka; Senyah, Francis; Florence, Isaac; Cook, Bryony; Marchant, Elizabeth; Blomquist, Paula Bianca; Flannagan, Joe; Dabrera, Gavin; Lewis, James; Lamagni, Theresa",International journal of epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyab176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34468729/,571
606170,Analysis of the intensity of the COVID-19 epidemic in Berlin towards an universal prognostic relationship,2021-01-04,"Background Renal transplant recipients are at increased risk for an adverse course of Covid-19, most likely due to immunosuppression and the high level of cardiovascular comorbidity. Many transplant reci-pients are aware of these facts. The psychological effects of this knowledge, however, remain elusive. Methods Cross-sectional study on 62 renal transplant recipients. 50 cardiovascular outpatients without immunosuppression and 55 healthy subjects served as control. We performed a focused psychological assessment during the pandemic (April 2020) and compared the data to a moment six months before. Additionally, an intergroup analysis was performed for the data during the pandemic. The analysis was performed by means of a questionnaire derived from KPD-38. We extracted five questions focusing on the parameters ""life satisfaction"" and perceived ""action competence"". Life satisfaction score ranged from 2 to 8, the score for action competence from 5 to 20. Results Both life satisfaction and perceived action competence were significantly lower during the pandemic than six months before in all the three groups (p<0.005 each). During the pandemic median levels of life satisfaction did not significantly differ between the three groups (transplant recipients 6, IQR 4-7; cardiovascular patients 5, IQR 4-6; healthy controls 6, IQR 5-7; Kruskall Wallis p>0.05). In contrast, the perceived action competence was higher in healthy subjects (15, IQR 12-17) than in both renal transplant recipients (13, IQR 10-15) and cardiovascular patients (13, IQR 8-14, Kruskall Wallis p=0.0003). Conclusion The Covid-19 pandemic has negative effects on life satisfaction and perceived action competence in renal transplant recipients, cardiovascular patients without immunosuppression and healthy subjects. The effects on life satisfaction in transplant recipients did not differ from non-immunocompromised patients or healthy controls. In contrast, the feeling of reduced action competence exceeded healthy controls, most likely due to a subjective need for stricter social distancing to avoid infection.","Zgoura, Panagiota; Seibert, Felix S.; Waldecker, Christoph; Doevelaar, Adrian; Bauer, Frederic; Rohn, Benjamin; Schenker, Peter; Wunsch, Andreas; Viebahn, Richard; Babel, Nina; Westhoff, Timm H.",Transplant Proc,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004113452032710X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004223/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004113452032710X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2020.08.043,571
606585,Modeling the COVID-19 epidemic in Okinawa,2020-04-22,"Isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests (iNATs), such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), are good alternatives to PCR-based amplification assays, especially for point-of-care and low-resource use, in part because they can be carried out with relatively simple instrumentation. However, iNATs can often generate spurious amplicons, especially in the absence of target sequences, resulting in false-positive results. This is especially true if signals are based on non-sequence-specific probes, such as intercalating dyes or pH changes. In addition, pathogens often prove to be moving, evolving targets and can accumulate mutations that will lead to inefficient primer binding and thus false-negative results. Multiplex assays targeting different regions of the analyte and logical signal readout using sequence-specific probes can help to reduce both false negatives and false positives. Here, we describe rapid conversion of three previously described SARS-CoV-2 LAMP assays that relied on a non-sequence-specific readout into individual and multiplex one-pot assays that can be visually read using sequence-specific oligonucleotide strand exchange (OSD) probes. We describe both fluorescence-based and Boolean logic-gated colorimetric lateral flow readout methods and demonstrate detection of SARS-CoV-2 virions in crude human saliva. IMPORTANCE One of the key approaches to treatment and control of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, is accurate and rapid diagnostics that is widely deployable in a timely and scalable manner. To achieve this, it is essential to go beyond the traditional gold standard of quantitative PCR (qPCR) that is often faced with difficulties in scaling due to the complexity of infrastructure and human resource requirements. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), have been long pursued as ideal, low-tech alternatives for rapid, portable testing. However, isothermal approaches often suffer from false signals due to employment of nonspecific readout methods. We describe general principles for rapidly converting nonspecifically read LAMP assays into assays that are read in a sequence-specific manner by using oligonucleotide strand displacement (OSD) probes. We also demonstrate that inclusion of OSD probes in LAMP assays maintains the simplicity of one-pot assays and a visual yes/no readout by using fluorescence or colorimetric lateral-flow dipsticks while providing accurate sequence-specific readout and the ability to logically query multiplex amplicons for redundancy or copresence. These principles not only yielded high-surety isothermal assays for SARS-CoV-2 but might also aid in the design of more sophisticated molecular assays for other analytes.","Bhadra, Sanchita; Riedel, Timothy E.; Lakhotia, Simren; Tran, Nicholas D.; Ellington, Andrew D.",mSphere,https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00911-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34011690/,571
606986,How to evaluate the success of the COVID-19 measures implemented by the Norwegian government by analyzing changes in doubling time,2020-03-30,"BACKGROUND: COVID − 19 pandemic pressured medical schools globally to shift to Distance learning (DL) as an alternative way to ensure that the content delivered is satisfactory for student progression. AIM OF THE WORK: This work aims at mapping priorities for post-COVID planning for better balance between distance learning and face to face learning. METHODS: This qualitative study aimed to develop a model for utilizing DL using The Polarity Approach for Continuity and Transformation (PACT)™. A virtual mapping session was held with 79 faculty from 19 countries. They worked in small groups to determine upsides and downsides of face-to-face and DL subsequently. An initial polarity map was generated identifying five tension areas; Faculty, Students, Curriculum, Social aspects and Logistics. A 63-item assessment tool was generated based on this map, piloted and then distributed as a self-administered assessment. The outcomes of this assessment were utilized for another mapping session to discuss warning signs and action steps to maintain upsides and avoid downsides of each pole. RESULTS: Participants agreed that face-to-face teaching allows them to inspire students and have meaningful connections with them. They also agreed that DL provides a good environment for most students. However, students with financial challenges and special needs may not have equal opportunities to access technology. As regards social issues, participants agreed that face-to-face learning provides a better chance for professionalism through enhanced team-work. Cognitive, communication and clinical skills are best achieved in face-to-face. Participants agreed that logistics for conducting DL are much more complicated when compared to face-to-face learning. Participants identified around 10 warning signs for each method that need to be continuously monitored in order to minimize the drawbacks of over focusing on one pole at the expense of the other. Action steps were determined to ensure optimized use of in either method. CONCLUSION: In order to plan for the future, we need to understand the dynamics of education within the context of polarities. Educators need to understand that the choice of DL, although was imposed as a no-alternative solution during the COVID era, yet it has always existed as a possible alternative and will continue to exist after this era. The value of polarity mapping and leveraging allows us to maximize the benefit of each method and guide educators’ decisions to minimize the downsides for the good of the learning process.","Ahmed, Samar A.; Hegazy, Nagwa N.; Abdel Malak, Hany W.; Cliff Kayser, W.; Elrafie, Noha M.; Hassanien, Mohammed; Al-Hayani, Abdulmonem A.; El Saadany, Sherif A.; AI-Youbi, Abdulrahman O.; Shehata, Mohamed H.",BMC Med Educ,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-020-02311-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33138818/,571

The maximal overlap discrete wavelet transformation first decomposes the original series into granular linear and nonlinear components. We then fit polynomial regression with interaction (PRI) and support vector regression (SVR) on linear and nonlinear components and obtain component-wise projections. The sum of these projections constitutes the final forecast. For accurate predictions, the PRI coefficients and tuning of the hyperparameters of SVR must be precisely estimated. Differential evolution, a metaheuristic optimization technique, helps to achieve these goals. We compare the forecast accuracy of the proposed regression framework with six advanced predictive modeling algorithms- multilayer perceptron neural network, random forest, adaptive neural fuzzy inference system, standalone SVR, multiple adaptive regression spline, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. Finally, we perform the numerical experimentation based on—(1) the daily closing prices of Bitcoin for January 10, 2013, to February 23, 2019, and (2) randomly generated surrogate time series through Monte Carlo analysis.

The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of a novel 12‐week, multidisciplinary ambulatory care program allowing frequent low‐volume ascitic drainage through a tunneled, intraperitoneal catheter (IPC). METHODS: Adult patients with cirrhosis complicated by refractory ascites were recruited through a liver clinic in a tertiary health service in Melbourne, Australia from April to December 2020. All patients were enrolled in a 12‐week multidisciplinary program including medical, nursing, dietetics, and pharmacy support. A Rocket Medical IPC was inserted on day 1 with 1–2 L of ascitic fluid drained over 1–3 sessions per week either at the patients' homes or at the hospital day ward. Patients' demographics, death, complications, and self‐reported outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Twelve patients were enrolled with a median of 65‐day (interquartile range [IQR]: 16.5–93) IPC duration between April and December 2020 across two periods of COVID‐related lockdown in Melbourne, Australia. There were no IPC‐related deaths. Early removal was necessitated in three patients due to leakage, nonadherence, and bacteremia. On day 30, the median self‐reported health score increased from 50 (IQR: 50–70) to 78 (IQR: 50–85), attributable to a reduction in symptom burden. CONCLUSION: A multidisciplinary IPC program including the use of short‐term IPC was safe and associated with a self‐reported improvement in perceptions of health. In the context of the COVID‐19 pandemic, the program aimed to reduce patient and clinician exposure, which is maintaining engagement and management of decompensated cirrhosis.","Ngu, Natalie LY; Anderson, Patricia; Hunter, Jo; Figredo, Anita; Papaluca, Timothy; Pianko, Stephen; Dev, Anouk; Bell, Sally; Le, Suong",JGH Open,https://doi.org/10.1002/jgh3.12641; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34622001/,571

METHODS: Factor analysis grouped 11 indicators into 7 distinct susceptibility factors for 3,079 counties in the conterminous United States. Unconditional mean differences are assessed using a multivariate general linear model. Data from 2018 are primarily taken from the US Census Bureau and CDC. RESULTS: About 33% of rural counties are highly susceptible to COVID‐19, driven by older and health‐compromised populations, and care facilities for the elderly. Major vulnerabilities in rural counties include fewer physicians, lack of mental health services, higher disability, and more uninsured. Poor Internet access limits telemedicine. Lack of social capital and social services may hinder local pandemic recovery. Meat processing facilities drive risk in micropolitan counties. Although metropolitan counties are less susceptible due to healthier and younger populations, about 6% are at risk due to community spread from dense populations. Metropolitan vulnerabilities include minorities at higher health and diabetes risk, language barriers, being a transportation hub that helps spread infection, and acute housing distress. CONCLUSIONS: There is an immediate need to know specific types of susceptibilities and vulnerabilities ahead of time to allow local and state health officials to plan and allocate resources accordingly. In rural areas it is essential to shelter‐in‐place vulnerable populations, whereas in large metropolitan areas general closure orders are needed to stop community spread. Pandemic response plans should address vulnerabilities.","Peters, David J.",J Rural Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32543751/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jrh.12477,571

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of physical inactivity and the patterns of physical activity among university students in confinement. This cross-sectional study involved 147 Malaysian students and 107 Indonesian students. Body weight before the pandemic and during the pandemic was self-reported by the respondents, and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) was used to assess the physical activity and sedentary behavior of the respondents. The findings revealed that 79.6% of Malaysians and 77.6% of Indonesians were physically active during the confinement. There was no significant difference (p < 0.05) in the duration devoted to vigorous-intensity activity (M(Malaysian) = 0.00 MET minutes/week and M(Indonesian) = 480.00 MET minutes/week) and moderate-intensity activity (M(Malaysian) = 0.00 MET minutes/week and M(Indonesian) = 0.00 MET minutes/week) among the studied population. During the pandemic, Malaysian students (M = 1386.00 MET minutes/week) devoted a significantly higher duration to walking (M = 1386.00 MET minutes/week) and sedentary behavior (9.16 ± 4.47 h/day) than Indonesian students (M = 990.00 MET minutes/week and sedentary behavior = 7.85 ± 4.27 h/day).

610069,Development and validation of an automated radiomic CT signature for detecting COVID-19,2020-05-01,"Human pathogenic RNA viruses are threats to public health because they are prone to escaping the human immune system through mutations of genomic RNA, thereby causing local outbreaks and global pandemics of emerging or re‐emerging viral diseases. While specific therapeutics and vaccines are being developed, a broad‐spectrum therapeutic agent for RNA viruses would be beneficial for targeting newly emerging and mutated RNA viruses. In this study, we conducted a screen of repurposed drugs using Sendai virus (an RNA virus of the family Paramyxoviridae), with human‐induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to explore existing drugs that may present anti‐RNA viral activity. Selected hit compounds were evaluated for their efficacy against two important human pathogens: Ebola virus (EBOV) using Huh7 cells and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) using Vero E6 cells. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), including raloxifene, exhibited antiviral activities against EBOV and SARS‐CoV‐2. Pioglitazone, a PPARγ agonist, also exhibited antiviral activities against SARS‐CoV‐2, and both raloxifene and pioglitazone presented a synergistic antiviral effect. Finally, we demonstrated that SERMs blocked entry steps of SARS‐CoV‐2 into host cells. These findings suggest that the identified FDA‐approved drugs can modulate host cell susceptibility against RNA viruses.","Imamura, Keiko; Sakurai, Yasuteru; Enami, Takako; Shibukawa, Ran; Nishi, Yohei; Ohta, Akira; Shu, Tsugumine; Kawaguchi, Jitsutaro; Okada, Sayaka; Hoenen, Thomas; Yasuda, Jiro; Inoue, Haruhisa",FEBS Open Bio,https://doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.13153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33822489/,571

The development of devices to specifically mitigate cross-contamination by droplet/splatter is crucial to stop infection transmission. The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a perioral suction device (Oral BioFilter, OBF) to reduce biological contamination spread during dental procedures. Materials and Methods Forty patients were randomized 1:1 to a standard professional dental hygiene treatment with OBF and without. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) bioluminescence assay was used to evaluate the spread of potential contaminants. The total number of relative light units (RLU) from key dental operatory locations: operator’s face-shield, back of the surgical operator’s-gloves, patient’s safety-goggles, and instrumental table were measured. Percentage contamination reductions between control and OBF were compared. Statistical Analysis Primary outcome, total RLU, was analyzed by comparing the means of logged data, using a two-sided two-sample t -test. Secondary outcomes as RLU of logged data for the different locations were analyzed in the same way. Proportion of patients from whom different locations reported events (clean, acceptable, and failure) were analyzed by using Fisher’s exact test. Results For the whole dental environment, RLUs reduction (<150 units) achieved with OBF was 98.4% (97.4–99%). By dental operatory location the reduction in RLUs was from 99.6%, on the operator face-shield, to 83% on instrumental table. The control group reported a very high percentage of failures, (>300) being 100% on the surfaces closer to the patient’s mouth and decreasing to 70% on instrumental table. In contrast, the higher failure percentage in the OBF group was found on the patient’s goggles (40%), while the operator face-shield showed an absence of contamination. Conclusion OBF device has shown efficient reduction of biological aerosol cross-contamination during dental procedures as proved by ATP-bioluminescence assay. Nevertheless, for maximum safety, its use must be combined with standard protective gear such as goggles, face shield, and surgical gloves.","Lloro, Víctor; Giovannoni, Maria Laura; Luaces, Vicente Lozano-de; Manzanares, Maria Cristina",Eur J Dent,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33711845/; https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1724152,571

Examinations of Some Associated Issues with a Case Study of COVID-19 Incubation Times,2021-09-21,"Eosinopenia was frequently encountered in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We describe a case of a 59-year-old man who was treated with high-dose corticosteroids and anti-interleukin 1 receptor antagonist therapy because of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome due to a so-called cytokine storm in COVID-19. He had chronic eosinophilia for many years due to an unknown Strongyloides stercoralis infection, proven by serology and a positive polymerase chain reaction test on a stool sample. COVID-19 led to a complete resolution of eosinophilia, even before immunosuppressive treatment was started. Eosinophilia returned after recovery from COVID-19 and started to decline under treatment with ivermectin. Our case confirms previous reports of eosinopenia in COVID-19, as it appears even in patients with chronic eosinophilia. Presence of eosinophilia should prompt screening for strongyloidiasis in all patients eligible for immunosuppressive therapy because of the risk of Strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome, especially if this treatment is empirical.","Stylemans, Dimitri; Van Cauwelaert, Stefan; D'Haenens, Alexander; Slabbynck, Hans",Infect Dis Clin Pract (Baltim Md),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34539164/; https://doi.org/10.1097/ipc.0000000000000991,571

However, there remain significant uncertainties in our understanding of the aerosol droplet microphysics occurring during drying and sedimentation and the effect on the sedimentation outcomes. Here, we apply a new treatment for the microphysical behavior of respiratory fluid droplets to a droplet evaporation/sedimentation model and assess the impact on sedimentation distance, time scale, and particle phase. Above a 100 μm initial diameter, the sedimentation outcome for a respiratory droplet is insensitive to composition and ambient conditions. Below 100 μm, and particularly below 80 μm, the increased settling time allows the exact nature of the evaporation process to play a significant role in influencing the sedimentation outcome. For this size range, an incorrect treatment of the droplet composition, or imprecise use of RH or temperature, can lead to large discrepancies in sedimentation distance (with representative values >1 m, >2 m, and >2 m, respectively). Additionally, a respiratory droplet is likely to undergo a phase change prior to sedimenting if initially <100 μm in diameter, provided that the RH is below the measured phase change RH. Calculations of the potential exposure versus distance from the infected source show that the volume fraction of the initial respiratory droplet distribution, in this size range, which remains elevated above 1 m decreases from 1 at 1 m to 0.125 at 2 m.","Walker, Jim S.; Archer, Justice; Gregson, Florence K.

Postmortem samples from an infant chimpanzee yielded near-complete genome sequences throughout the respiratory tract; other pathogens were absent. Epidemiologic modeling estimated the basic reproductive number (R(0)) for the epidemic as 1.83, consistent with the common cold in humans. Genotyping of 41 chimpanzees and examination of 24 published chimpanzee genomes from subspecies across Africa showed universal homozygosity for the cadherin-related family member 3 CDHR3-Y(529) allele, which increases risk for rhinovirus C infection and asthma in human children. These results indicate that chimpanzees exhibit a species-wide genetic susceptibility to rhinovirus C and that this virus, heretofore considered a uniquely human pathogen, can cross primate species barriers and threatens wild apes. We advocate engineering interventions and prevention strategies for rhinovirus infections for both humans and wild apes.","Scully, Erik J.; Basnet, Sarmi; Wrangham, Richard W.; Muller, Martin N.; Otali, Emily; Hyeroba, David; Grindle, Kristine A.; Pappas, Tressa E.; Thompson, Melissa Emery; Machanda, Zarin; Watters, Kelly E.; Palmenberg, Ann C.; Gern, James E.; Goldberg, Tony L.",Emerg Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2402.170778; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29350142/,571

Despite its well-described role in the gut and other environmental niches, the vaginal virome remains understudied. With a focus on sexual and reproductive health, we summarize the currently known components of the vaginal virome, its relationship with other constituents of the vaginal microbiota and its association with adverse health outcomes. While a range of eukaryote-infecting viruses has been described to be present in the female genital tract (FGT), few prokaryote-infecting viruses have been described. Literature suggests that various vaginal viruses interact with vaginal bacterial microbiota and host immunity and that any imbalance thereof may contribute to the risk of adverse reproductive health outcomes, including infertility and adverse birth outcomes. Current limitations of vaginal virome research include experimental and analytical constraints. Considering the vaginal virome may represent the missing link in our understanding of the relationship between FGT bacteria, mucosal immunity, and adverse sexual and reproductive health outcomes, future studies evaluating the vaginal microbiome and its population dynamics holistically will be important for understanding the role of the vaginal virome in balancing health and disease.","Happel, Anna-Ursula; Varsani, Arvind; Balle, Christina; Passmore, Jo-Ann; Jaspan, Heather",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32751611/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12080832,571

We aimed to explore the seroprevalence of hospital staff in the area with zero confirmed COVID-19 case to shed light on the situation of COVID-19 infection in zero or low infection rate countries where mass screening was not readily available. METHODS: A locally developed rapid immunoglobulin M (IgM)/immunoglobulin G (IgG) test kit was used for hospital staff screening of Ranong hospital which is located in a province with zero COVID-19 prevalence in Thailand from 17(th) April to 17(th) May 2020. All staff was tested, 100 of which were randomly invited to have a repeating antibody test in one month. (Thai Clinical Trials Registry: TCTR20200426002) RESULTS: Of 844 hospital staff, 82 were tested twice one month apart (response rate for repeating antibody test 82%). Overall, 0.8% of the participants (7 of 844) had positive IgM, none had positive IgG. Female staff had 1.0% positive IgM (95% CI: 0.5–2.1%) while male had 0.5% positive IgM (95% CI: 0.1–2.6%). No participants with a history of travel to the high-risk area or close contact with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 case developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Among 844 staff, 811 had no symptoms and six of them developed IgM seropositive (0.7%) while 33 had minor symptoms and only one of them developed IgM seropositive (3.0%). No association between SARS-CoV-2 IgM status and gender, history of travel to a high-risk area, close contact with PCR-confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case, presence of symptoms within 14 days, or previous PCR status was found. None of the hospital staff developed SARS-CoV-2 IgG. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 antibody test could detect a considerable number of hospital staff who could be potential silent spreaders in a province with zero COVID-19 cases. Accurate antibody testing is a valuable screening tool, particularly in asymptomatic healthcare workers.

Anisodamine hydrobromide injection (AHI), the main ingredient of which is anisodamine, is a listed drug for improving microcirculation in China. Anisodamine can improve the condition of patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Protein-protein interactions obtained from the String databases were used to construct the protein interaction network (PIN) of AHI using Cytoscape. The crucial targets of AHI PIN were screened by calculating three topological parameters. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses were performed. The intersection between the AHI component proteins and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) coexpression proteins was analyzed. We further investigated our predictions of crucial targets by performing molecular docking studies with anisodamine. RESULTS: The PIN of AHI, including 172 nodes and 1454 interactions, was constructed. A total of 54 crucial targets were obtained based on topological feature calculations. The results of Gene Ontology showed that AHI could regulate cell death, cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, and immune system processes. KEGG disease pathways were mainly enriched in viral infections, cancer, and immune system diseases. Between AHI targets and ACE2 coexpression proteins, 26 common proteins were obtained. The results of molecular docking showed that anisodamine bound well to all the crucial targets. CONCLUSION: The network pharmacological strategy integrated molecular docking to explore the mechanism of action of AHI against COVID-19. It provides protein targets associated with COVID-19 that may be further tested as therapeutic targets of anisodamine.","Su, Jinsong; Liu, Zixuan; Liu, Chuan; Li, Xuanhao; Wang, Yi; Zhao, Jing; Wu, Qingjiang; Zheng, Shichao; Zhang, Yi",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/5818107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32802131/,571

Covid-19 is a pandemic that is associated with a relatively high rate of severe lung disease and mortality. The mortality is particularly high in those with certain comorbidities and increases with age. Recently, several companies have developed an effective vaccination against Covid-19. Although the reported frequency of severe side effects is low, there is an emerging discussion about the safety of Covid-19 vaccination in patients with severe allergies and mastocytosis. However, even in these patients, severe adverse reactions are rare. We therefore recommend the broad use of Covid-19 vaccination in patients with mastocytosis on a global basis. The only well-established exception is a known or suspected allergy against a constituent of the vaccine. Safety measures, including premedication and post-vaccination observation should be considered in all patients with mastocytosis, depending on the individual personal risk and overall situation in each case.

Unfortunately, a robust clinical trial for its effectiveness is not feasible at this emergency. Additionally, HCQ was suspected of causing cardiovascular adverse reactions (CV-AEs), but it has never been directly investigated. The objective of this pharmacovigilance analysis was to determine and characterize HCQ-associated cardiovascular adverse events (CV-AEs). We performed a disproportionality analysis of HCQ-associated CV-AEs using the FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS) database. The FAERS database, comprising more than 11,901,836 datasets and 10,668,655 patient records with drug-adverse reactions, was analyzed. The disproportionality analysis was used to calculate the reporting odds ratios (ROR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to predict HCQ-associated CV-AEs.

In this study, the inhibitory potential of 99 secondary metabolites obtained from endophytic fungi was investigated against the new coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) using computational methods. A sequence of blind and targeted molecular dockings was performed to predict the more potent compounds on the viral enzyme. In the next step, the five selected compounds were further evaluated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Moreover, the pharmacokinetics of the metabolites was assessed using SwissADME server. The results of molecular docking showed that compounds 18-methoxy cytochalasin J, (22E,24R)-stigmasta-5,7,22-trien-3-β-ol, beauvericin, dankasterone B, and pyrrocidine A had higher binding energy than others. The findings of MD and SwissADME demonstrated that two fungal metabolites, 18-methoxy cytochalasin J and pyrrocidine A had better results than others in terms of protein instability, strong complex formation, and pharmacokinetic properties. In conclusion, it is recommended to further evaluate the compounds 18-methoxy cytochalasin J and pyrrocidine A in the laboratory as good candidates for inhibiting COVID-19.","Ebrahimi, Kosar Sadat; Ansari, Mohabbat; Hosseyni Moghaddam, Mahdieh S; Ebrahimi, Zohre; salehi, Zohre; Shahlaei, Mohsen; Moradi, Sajad",Comput Biol Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482521004078; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104613; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482521004078?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34242870/,571

617253,Global-scale analysis and longitudinal assessment of COVID-19 incidence in the first six months,2021-04-06,"BACKGROUND: Due to uncertainties encompassing the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, mathematical models informing the trajectory of disease are being proposed throughout the world. Current pandemic is also characterized by surge in hospitalizations which has overwhelmed even the most resilient health systems. Therefore, it is imperative to assess health system preparedness in tandem with need projections for comprehensive outlook. OBJECTIVE: We attempted this study to forecast the need for hospital resources for one year period and correspondingly assessed capacity and tipping points of Indian health system to absorb surges in need due to COVID-19. METHODS: We employed age-structured deterministic SEIR model and modified it to allow for testing and isolation capacity to forecast the need under varying scenarios. Projections for documented cases were made for varying degree of containment and mitigation strategies. Correspondingly, data on health resources was collated from various government records. Further, we computed daily turnover of each of these resources which was then adjusted for proportion of cases requiring mild, severe and critical care to arrive at maximum number of COVID-19 cases manageable by health care system of India. FINDINGS: Our results revealed pervasive deficits in the capacity of public health system to absorb surge in need during peak of epidemic. Also, model suggests that continuing strict lockdown measures in India after mid May 2020 would have been ineffective in suppressing total infections significantly. Augmenting testing of 1,500,000 tests per day during projected peak (mid-Sept) under social-distancing measures and current test to positive rate of 9.7% would lead to more documented cases (60, 000, 000 to 90, 000, 000) leading to surge in demand for hospital resources. A minimum allocation of 13x, 70x and 37x times more acute care beds, severe care beds and mechanical ventilators respectively would be required to commensurate with need under that scenario. However, if testing capacity is limited to 9,000,000 tests per day (current situation as of 19th August 2020) under continued social-distancing measures, documented cases would plummet significantly, still requiring 5x, 31x and 16x times the current allocated resources (acute care beds, severe care beds and mechanical ventilators respectively) to meet unmet need for COVID-19 treatment in India.","Verma, Veenapani Rajeev; Saini, Anuraag; Gandhi, Sumirtha; Dash, Umakant; Koya, Shaffi Fazaludeen",Infect Dis Model,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.08.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042720300415?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468042720300415; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32875175/,571

CCR5 antagonists constitute a new class of antiretrovirals. Three molecules of this class have reached phases 2B and 3 of clinical development: aplaviroc (GlaxoSmithKine), vicriviroc (Schering-Plough) and maraviroc (Pfizer). The development of aplaviroc was stopped because of some cases of drug-induced hepatitis. In ACTG 5211 and Motivate trials, adding vicriviroc (in phase 3 trials) or maraviroc (now approved for clinical use) respectively to an optimized background regimen in treatment-experienced patients has resulted in a significant virologic benefit. The place of this new therapeutic class in strategies of initial, switch or rescue treatment needs further investigation, and its interest in immunological non-responders, in severe immunosuppressed patients or in subjects harbouring non-R5 HIV-1 strains, remains to be addressed. Major concerns about their use still remain, including long-term tolerability, the risk of inducing an R5 to X4 switch, particularly in compartments other than blood, and the risk of interfering with some immune responses.","Psomas, K.C.; Corbeau, P.; Reynes, J.",Antibiotiques (Paris),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288525/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antib.2010.01.006,571

Such major viral outbreaks demand early elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 virus genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 virus genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing (MLDSP) for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp, including the 29 COVID-19 virus sequences available on January 27, 2020. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify the COVID-19 virus as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves 100% accurate classification of the COVID-19 virus sequences, and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification.","Randhawa, Gurjit S.; Soltysiak, Maximillian P.

618204,A Decision Support System for Scheduling the Shifts of Physicians During COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-09-25,"BACKGROUND: Telemedicine was adopted to minimize exposure risks for patients and staff during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. This study measured patient satisfaction and telemedicine usability in breast cancer care. METHODS: Adult breast cancer patients who had a telemedicine visit at a single academic institution (with surgical, radiation, or medical oncology) from 15 June 2020 to 4 September 2020 were surveyed anonymously. Patient and cancer characteristics were collected, and patient satisfaction and telemedicine usability were assessed using a modified Telehealth Usability Questionnaire with a 7-point Likert scale. Associations of satisfaction and usability with patient characteristics were analyzed using Wilcoxon rank-sum and Kruskal–Wallis tests. RESULTS: Of 203 patients who agreed to be contacted, 78 responded, yielding a response rate of 38%. The median age of the respondents was 63 years (range 25–83 years). The majority lived in an urban area (61%), were white (92%), and saw a medical oncologist (62%). The median patient satisfaction score was 5.5 (interquartile range [IQR] 4.25–6.25). The median telemedicine usability score was 5.6 (IQR 4.4–6.2). A strong positive correlation was seen between satisfaction and usability, with a Spearman correlation coefficient (ρ) of 0.80 (p < 0.001). Satisfaction and usability scores did not vary significantly according to patient age, race, location of residence, insurance status, previous visit commute time, oncology specialty seen, prior telemedicine visits, or whether patients were actively receiving cancer treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer patients were satisfied with telemedicine and found it usable. Patient satisfaction and telemedicine usability should not limit the use of telemedicine in future post-pandemic breast cancer care.

Several pulmonary and systemic manifestations of the illness have been described since the discovery of this virus. However, there have been higher-risk populations in which this infection has not been well studied nor documented. One of these populations includes the pregnant cohort. The purpose of this article is to describe the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 infection in the pregnant population and review the implications and sequelae of the infection throughout pregnancy and outcomes of live births. Also, we summarize the understanding and safety of current treatments and vaccination in pregnancy. This comprehensive review article comprises several case reports, case series, cohort studies, retrospective studies, and randomized clinical trials. Findings regarding maternal morbidity included an increased risk of acquiring severe COVID-19 infection requiring a higher level of inpatient hospital care along with an increased risk of preterm labor and cesarean delivery. Neonatal COVID-19 vertical transmission was shown to have conflicting data as there was a presence of transmission in certain retrospective studies and absence in others. There was also no evidence of teratogenicity from maternal COVID-19 infection. In conclusion, in part due to the unique physiologic state of pregnancy and part due to unknown factors, pregnant patients are at increased risk for negative outcomes of COVID-19 infection and must be classified as a high-risk population.","Hapshy, Vera; Aziz, Daniel; Kahar, Payal; Khanna, Deepesh; Johnson, Kenneth E.; Parmar, Mayur S.",SN Compr Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42399-021-00915-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898924/,571

Existing research has focused almost exclusively on the effect that legal changes--such as voter identification laws--have on turnout. This paper extends our understanding of the electoral process by exploring how one aspect of the precinct experience--standing in line to vote--can shape the turnout behavior of voters in subsequent elections. I demonstrate that for every additional hour a voter waits in line to vote, their probability of voting in the subsequent election drops by 1 percentage point. To arrive at these estimates, I analyze vote history files using a combination of exact matching and placebo tests to test the identification assumptions. I then leverage an unusual institutional arrangement in the City of Boston and longitudinal data from Florida to show that the result also holds at the precinct level. The findings in this paper have important policy implications for administrative changes that may impact line length, such as voter identification requirements and precinct consolidation. They also suggest that racial asymmetries in precinct wait times contribute to the gap in turnout rates between white and non-white voters.","Pettigrew, Stephen",Elect Stud,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379420300718; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electstud.2020.102188; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0261379420300718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839636/,571

To address this growing need, Ph.D. programs have explored ways to integrate quantitative training into their existing curricula. However, these attempts have been hindered by limitations on total instructional time, faculty perceptions, and scalability. Here, we describe a flipped approach that combined a preexisting online course with group problem solving sessions to effectively and efficiently teach biomedical Ph.D. students key concepts in the use of the Python programming language for research. Following the COVID-19 related shutdowns in March 2020, we successfully adapted this approach to an all-online version where the formerly in-person problem-solving sessions occurred in small groups over Zoom. We found that students in both in-person and remote flipped formats showed increased confidence using Python and related this to their thesis research. Following the shift to the fully remote format, the lack of a physically present instructor seemed to increase students’ reliance on their classmates, which in turn promoted peer learning and support. This flexible, scalable approach to computational training may address the needs of many biomedical Ph.D. programs.","Vladis, Nathalie A.; Coleman, Bradley I.",Journal of Microbiology & Biology Education,https://doi.org/10.1128/jmbe.00099-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34594468/,571

AKI is a strong predictor of mortality. Routine urinalysis gives an insight into the renal pathology of the patient. We studied the incidence of urinary abnormalities in hospitalised Covid-19 patients and analysed their impact on development of AKI and mortality. METHODS: Information on 110 hospitalised patients with confirmed Covid-19 was retrospectively collected and analysed. The demographic data such as age, gender, comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus, the need for dialysis and laboratory data such as urine for albumin, glucose, RBC and WBC, and serum creatinine were collected. The diagnosis of AKI was based on the KDIGO criteria. The outcomes studied were development of AKI and hospital mortality. RESULTS: Urine abnormalities were seen in 71% of the patients. Proteinuria in 58.2%, haematuria in 17.3%, pyuria in 8.2% of patients and concurrent proteinuria and haematuria was seen in 13.6% of patients. AKI was seen in 28.2% of patients and hospital mortality was 24.5%. AKI was strongly associated with mortality. Proteinuria and haematuria were good predictors of development of AKI, more strongly when they occurred concurrently (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that urine analysis is a simple test, which can be used to predict development of AKI and mortality and may be used for risk stratification of Covid-19 patients, especially in low resource settings.","Sundaram, Supraja; Soni, Mamta; Annigeri, Rajeev",Diabetes Metab Syndr,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402120305166; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.12.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33383438/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120305166,571

When comparing EoSC++versus EoSC−, Hispanic ethnicity (p=0.009), hypertension (p=0.02), and history of stroke/TIA (p=0.002) were less common in EoSC+. No demographic/risk factor differences were noted for EoSC+ Stroke+ vs. EoSC+ Stroke−. No cases of rt-PA eligibility/treatment were noted. In EoSC+ Stroke+ analysis, imaging positive stroke/intracranial hemorrhage was noted on only 3 cases (3/2982=0.10% of all stroke codes) and none were posterior stroke. CONCLUSIONS: EoSC+ rarely results in stroke/TIA (0.27%) or stroke (0.10%), and in our analysis never (0%) resulted in rt-PA. Sub-analysis did not show missed rt-PA or posterior strokes. Understanding characteristics, and knowing that EoSC+ Stroke+ patients are unlikely to receive rt-PA, may help triage stroke resources.","Chen, Patrick M; Meyer, Dawn M; Meyer, Brett C",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807437/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1052305720304407; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1052305720304407; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.105022,571

Many of these glycans affect virulence through modulating virus receptor binding, masking antigenic sites, or by stimulating the host immune response. Mass spectrometry (MS) has arisen as a pivotal technique for the characterization of VSP glycosylation. This review will cover how MS-based analyses, such as released glycan profiles, glycan site localization, site-occupancy, and site-specific heterogeneity, are being utilized to map VSP glycosylation. Furthermore, this review will provide information on how MS glycoprofiling data are being used in conjunction with molecular and structural experiments to provide a better understanding of the role of specific glycans in VSP function.","Hargett, Audra A; Renfrow, Matthew B",Curr Opin Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202133/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625719300392; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879625719300392; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2019.05.003,571

621094,Quantifying the impact of quarantine duration on COVID-19 transmission,2021-02-05,"BACKGROUND: Falls are a major public health issue and one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among the older adults in many countries. Falls and their consequences have an impact on people’s quality of life, particularly the older adults. However, there have been very few studies on falls among ethnic minority groups living in rural areas. The aim of this study was to examine factors related to fall awareness, falls, and quality of life among ethnic minority older adults living in northern Thailand. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 462 older adults from ethnic minority groups living in rural communities in Phayao and Lamphun provinces of northern Thailand using a multi-stage sampling technique. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews, with structured questionnaires covering health information, fall awareness, and quality of life (WHOQOL-OLD). The factors were determined using simple linear regression and binary logistic regression. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 68.2, Karen (35.5%), Mien (24.2%), indigenous (20.8%), and Hmong (19.5%). In the previous 12 months, 20.6% of elders had experienced a fall, and 4.5% of them had experienced multiple falls. More than half of the elders had moderate fall awareness and quality of life (71.6% and 68.6%, respectively). Univariate analysis revealed that minority group, sociodemographic characteristics, sleep duration, and fear of falling were all found to be associated with fall awareness, falls, and quality of life score (p<0.001). There was a significant relationship among fall awareness, falls, and quality of life score (p<0.001). Compared to those who had not fallen in the previous year, the quality of life of the older adults who had fallen was about 11 points lower. CONCLUSION: Several independent variables were discovered to be fall risk factors and quality of life indicators. It is critical to recognize the risk factors to promote fall prevention programs that are appropriate for the older adults among ethnic minorities. Therefore, public health agencies and local government should be aware of the problem and initiate an implementation program and policy to prevent falls and improve the quality of life among ethnic minority older adults.","Kantow, Supakan; Seangpraw, Katekaew; Ong-artborirak, Parichat; Tonchoy, Prakasit; Auttama, Nisarat; Bootsikeaw, Sasivimol; Choowanthanapakorn, Monchanok",Clin Interv Aging,https://doi.org/10.2147/cia.s328912; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34629869/,571

However, therapeutic options for treatment are still very limited. The development of drugs that target vital proteins in the viral life cycle is a feasible approach for treating COVID-19. Belonging to the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae with the largest RNA genome, SARS-CoV-2 encodes a total of 29 proteins. These non-structural, structural and accessory proteins participate in entry into host cells, genome replication and transcription, and viral assembly and release. SARS-CoV-2 proteins can individually perform essential physiological roles, be components of the viral replication machinery or interact with numerous host cellular factors. In this Review, we delineate the structural features of SARS-CoV-2 from the whole viral particle to the individual viral proteins and discuss their functions as well as their potential as targets for therapeutic interventions.","Yang, Haitao; Rao, Zihe",Nat Rev Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34535791/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-021-00630-8,571

622273,The introduction of population migration to SEIAR for COVID-19 epidemic modelling with an efficient intervention strategy,2020-08-06,"All known recently emerged human coronaviruses likely originated in bats. Here, we used a single experimental platform based on human lung-only mice (LoM) to demonstrate efficient in vivo replication of all recently emerged human coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) and two highly relevant endogenous pre-pandemic SARS-like bat coronaviruses. Virus replication in this model occurs in bona fide human lung tissue and does not require any type of adaptation of the virus or the host. Our results indicate that bats harbor endogenous coronaviruses capable of direct transmission into humans. Further detailed analysis of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 in vivo infection of LoM human lung tissue showed predominant infection of human lung epithelial cells, including type II pneumocytes present in alveoli and ciliated airway cells. Acute SARS-CoV-2 infection was highly cytopathic and induced a robust and sustained Type I interferon and inflammatory cytokine/chemokine response. Finally, we evaluated a pre-exposure prophylaxis strategy for coronavirus infection. Our results show that prophylactic administration of EIDD-2801, an oral broad spectrum antiviral currently in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19, dramatically prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo and thus has significant potential for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Wahl, Angela; Gralinski, Lisa; Johnson, Claire; Yao, Wenbo; Kovarova, Martina; Dinnon, Kenneth; Liu, Hongwei; Madden, Victoria; Krzystek, Halina; De, Chandrav; White, Kristen; Schäfer, Alexandra; Zaman, Tanzila; Leist, Sarah; Grant, Paul; Gully, Kendra; Askin, Frederic; Browne, Edward; Jones, Corbin; Pickles, Raymond; Baric, Ralph; Garcia, J Victor",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-80404/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32995766/,571

The paper also describes a premature baby with reverse transcription (RT)-PCR-positive COVID-19 seen at the Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK. DESIGN: We conducted a multifaceted search of the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, Medline and PubMed from 1 December 2019 to 12 May 2020 to harvest articles from medical journals and publications reporting cases of COVID-19 in neonates from anywhere in the world. Additional searches were also done so as not to miss any important publications. Write-up was in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, the protocol for the review was registered with International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), and risk of bias was analysed with the Newcastle-Ottawa tool. Additionally, the preterm neonate with COVID-19 from our hospital is also reported. RESULTS: The systematic review has revealed eight studies where neonates have been described to have confirmed COVID-19, with low risk of bias. Of the 10 reported cases elsewhere, only three are likely to be vertically transmitted, while seven occurred in the postperinatal period and are likely to have been postnatally acquired. All neonates had a mild course, recovered fully and were negative on retesting. Our case of COVID-19 in a 32-week premature baby from the UK was delivered by emergency caesarean section, with the mother wearing a face mask and the family having no contact with the neonate, suggesting vertical transmission. On day 33, the neonate was asymptomatic but was still RT-PCR-positive on nasopharyngeal airway swab. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal infection is uncommon, with only two previously reported cases likely to be of vertical transmission. The case we report is still RT-PCR-positive on day 28 and is asymptomatic. Ongoing research is needed to ascertain the epidemiology of COVID-19 in neonates.","Gordon, Morris; Kagalwala, Taher; Rezk, Karim; Rawlingson, Chris; Ahmed, M Idris; Guleri, Achyut",BMJ Paediatr Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32574345/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjpo-2020-000718,571

The current vaccines are less satisfactory to confer protections from heterologous infections and long-term persistence, and the need for better vaccines are urgent. The immunological hallmarks in PRRSV-infected pigs include the unusually poor production of type I interferons (IFNs-α/β) and the aberrant and delayed adaptive immune responses, indicating that PRRSV has the ability to suppress both innate and adaptive immune responses in the host. Type I IFNs are the potent antiviral cytokines and recent studies reveal their pleiotropic functions in the priming of expansion and maturation of adaptive immunity. Thus, IFN antagonism-negative PRRSV is hypothesized to be attenuated and to build effective and broad- spectrum innate and adaptive immune responses in pigs.

Although, the Chinese state has established a targeted Rehabilitation Assistance System for Disabled Children and has expanded the provision of rehabilitation services, a severe deviation between supply and demand remains. Existing studies have focused relatively more on policy content and less on the policy context, at the macro-structural level. However, using the case of the ZW Rehabilitation Center in City J, this study divided the deviation into exclusion errors and inclusion errors, and used the policy context approach to explore the reasons for the deviation. We found that the behaviors of the participants in rehabilitation services exist in a dynamic interaction between the regulatory context, the normative context, and the cognitive context. The joint forces of the three contexts produce both exclusion errors and inclusion errors, which are the underlying reasons for the inaccurate execution of the targeted policy. The results of this research can provide enlightenment for improving rehabilitation policy.","Qi, Cai Yun; Wang, Yuan",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.666333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898385/,571

In the first half of 2020, because of the widespread of the COVID-19, researches were focused on the monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in water, wastewater, sludge, air, and on surfaces, in order to assess the risk of contracting the viral infection from contaminated environments. So far, the survival of the novel Coronavirus out of the human body has been reported for short time periods (from hours to few days, in optimized in vitro conditions), mainly because of the need of an host organism which could consent the viral attack, and due to the weak external membrane of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding strategies in the environment, either through animate and unanimate matrices, or exploiting the organic matter in water, wastewater, and waste in general, have been discussed in the present article.

METHODS: Data came from an online survey of United States pregnant women (n = 715), conducted in May 2020. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale were used to assess depressive symptoms, thoughts of self‐harm, and moderate or severe anxiety. Multiple logistic regressions were used to examine the associations of COVID‐19 experiences with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Participants were racially diverse. The prevalence of adverse mental health outcomes was 36% for probable depression, 20% for thoughts of self‐harm, and 22% for anxiety. Women who reported family members dying from COVID‐19 had four times higher odds of having thoughts of self‐harm than women who did not experience family death. Depression was more prevalent among women who canceled or reduced medical appointments. Women were more likely to have worse mental health outcomes if they expressed worry about getting financial or emotional/social support, about their pregnancy, or about family or friends. Strict social distancing was positively associated with depression. A higher proportion of adults working from home was inversely associated with depression and thoughts of self‐harm. CONCLUSION: High percentages of pregnant women had symptoms of depression or anxiety, suggesting an urgent need to screen and treat mental health conditions among pregnant women during the pandemic. Pandemic‐related risks and protective factors are relevant to developing tailored interventions to address the mental health of pregnant women during pandemic circumstances.","Liu, Jihong; Hung, Peiyin; Alberg, Anthony J.; Hair, Nicole L.; Whitaker, Kara M.; Simon, Jessica; Taylor, Sherri K.",Birth,https://doi.org/10.1111/birt.12554; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34008216/,571

It has affected millions of people and continues to affect more, despite the tremendous social preventive measures. The therapeutic strategy relies on suppressing infectivity and inflammation, along with immune modulation. The identification of candidate drugs effective for COVID-19 is crucial, thus many natural products including phytochemicals are also being proposed for repurposing and evaluated for their potential in COVID-19. Among numerous phytochemicals, limonene (LMN), a dietary terpene of natural origin has been recently showed to target viral proteins in the in-silico studies. LMN is one of the main compounds identified in many citrus plants, available and accessible in diets and well-studied for its therapeutic benefits. Due to dietary nature, relative safety and efficacy along with favorable physicochemical properties, LMN has been suggested to be a fascinating candidate for further investigation in COVID-19. LMN showed to modulate numerous signaling pathways and inhibits inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, prostanoids, and eicosanoids. We hypothesized that given the pathogenesis of COVID-19 involving infection, inflammation, and immunity, LMN may have potential to limit the severity and progression of the disease owing to its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties. The present article discusses the possibilities of LMN in SARS-CoV-2 infections based on its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties. Though, the suggestion on the possible use of LMN in COVID-19 remains inconclusive until the in-silico effects confirmed in the experimental studies and further proof of the concept studies. The candidature of LMN in COVID-19 treatment somewhat appear speculative but cannot be overlooked provided favorable physiochemical and druggable properties. The safety and efficacy of LMN are necessary to be established in preclinical and clinical studies before making suggestions for use in humans.","Nagoor Meeran, M.F.; Seenipandi, A.; Javed, Hayate; Sharma, Charu; Hashiesh, Hebaallah Mamdouh; Goyal, Sameer N.; Jha, Niraj Kumar; Ojha, Shreesh",Heliyon,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844020325469; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33490659/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405844020325469; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05703,571

The need to target agents safely, efficiently, and selectively has become increasingly evident because of progress in vascular targeting. The vascular endothelium is a central target for intervention, given its multiple roles in the physiology (in health) and pathophysiology (in disease) and its direct accessibility to circulating ligands. In cancer, the expression of specific molecules on the surface of vascular endothelial and perivascular cells might enable direct therapeutic targeting. The use of in vivo phage display has significantly contributed to the identification of such targets, which have been successfully used for directed vascular targeting in preclinical animal models. Several animal studies have been performed by using fused molecules between tumor endothelium-directed molecules and immunomodulatory, procoagulant, or cytotoxic molecules. In addition to delivery of therapeutic agents, vascular targeted gene therapies based on both ligand-directed delivery of gene vectors to tumor endothelium and transcriptional targeting have also emerged. In this review, we discuss ligand-directed vascular targeting strategies with an emphasis on recent developments related to phage-display-based screenings.","Hajitou, Amin; Pasqualini, Renata; Arap, Wadih",Trends Cardiovasc Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1050173806000041; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1050173806000041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16546688/,571

The purpose of this article is to review the spectrum of the various neurological manifestations and underlying associated pathophysiology in COVID-19 patients. Method: We conducted a review of the various case reports and retrospective clinical studies published on the neurological manifestations, associated literature, and related pathophysiology of COVID-19 using PUBMED and subsequent proceedings. A total of 118 articles were thoroughly reviewed in order to highlight the plausible spectrum of neurological manifestations of COVID 19. Every article was either based on descriptive analysis, clinical scenarios, correspondence, and editorials emphasizing the neurological manifestations either directly or indirectly. We then tried to highlight the significant plausible manifestations and complications that could be related to the pandemic. With little known about the dynamics and the presentation spectrum of the virus apart from the respiratory symptoms, this area needs further consideration. Conclusion: The neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 such as Encephalitis, Meningitis, acute cerebrovascular disease, and Guillain Barré Syndrome (GBS) are of great concern. But in the presence of life-threatening abnormal vitals in severely ill COVID-19 patients, these are not usually underscored. There is a need to diagnose these manifestations at the earliest to limit long term sequelae. Much research is needed to explore the role of SARS-CoV-2 in causing these neurological manifestations by isolating it either from cerebrospinal fluid or brain tissues of the deceased on autopsy. We also recommend exploring the risk factors that lead to the development of these neurological manifestations.","Ahmed, Muhammad Umer; Hanif, Muhammad; Ali, Mukarram Jamat; Haider, Muhammad Adnan; Kherani, Danish; Memon, Gul Muhammad; Karim, Amin H.; Sattar, Abdul",Front Neurol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.00518; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32574248/,571

Via its seven intrinsic lysine residues and its N-terminus, it can also form ubiquitin chains on substrates in many possible ways. To study ubiquitin signals, many synthetic and semi-synthetic routes have been developed for generation of ubiquitin-derived tools and conjugates. The strength of these methods lies in their ability to introduce chemo-selective ligation handles at sites that currently cannot be enzymatically modified. Here, we review the different synthetic and semi-synthetic methods available for ubiquitin conjugate synthesis and their contribution to how they have helped investigating conformational diversity of diubiquitin signals. Next, we discuss how these methods help understanding the ubiquitin conjugation–deconjugation system by recent advances in ubiquitin ligase probes and diubiquitin-based DUB probes. Lastly, we discuss how these methods help studying post-translational modification of ubiquitin itself.","van Tilburg, Gabriëlle BA; Elhebieshy, Angela F; Ovaa, Huib",Curr Opin Struct Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959440X16300574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27315041/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X16300574; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbi.2016.05.022,571
627381,Risk of using hydroxychloroquine as a treatment of COVID-19,2020-08-12,"Shigellosis is an acute invasive disease of the lower intestine, which afflicts millions of people worldwide with an estimated one million fatalities per annum. Despite of extensive research during the last two decades, a vaccine against multi-drug resistant Shigella is not yet available in the market. To provide a safe, effective and broad-spectrum vaccine against Shigella, we explored food grade bacteria Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) for the delivery of conserved antigenic protein; Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) to the mucosal sites for effective elicitation of systemic and mucosal immunity. We have previously confirmed the immunogenic potential of recombinant L. lactis expressing OmpA (LacVax® OmpA) in BALB/c mice. In the present study, we have characterized the humoral and cellular immune profile of LacVax® OmpA and assessed its protective efficacy using a newly developed human like murine shigellosis model. The significant increase in OmpA specific serum IgG, fecal sIgA and a Th1 dominant immune response (indicated by high INF-γ/IL-4 ratio) in LacVax® OmpA immunized mice revealed successful activation of humoral and cellular immunity. The LacVax® OmpA immunized animals were also protected from human-like shigellosis when challenged with S. flexneri 2a ATCC 12022. The antigen specific serum IgG, fecal sIgA, INF-γ and IL-10 levels were found to be the significant correlates of protection. Collectively these results suggest that the LacVax® OmpA is a promising prophylactic candidate against shigellosis. However, the protective efficacy of LacVax® OmpA in the higher animals would further strengthen its future application in humans.","Yagnik, Bhrugu; Sharma, Drashya; Padh, Harish; Desai, Priti",Vaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31047673/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X19305274; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.04.053; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X19305274,571
627546,What’s the evidence for COVID-19 booster shots?,2021-09-07,"The COVID‐19 pandemic caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 is threating global health. Inhibiting interaction of the receptor‐binding domain of SARS‐CoV‐2 S protein (S(RBD)) and human ACE2 receptor is a promising treatment strategy. However, SARS‐CoV‐2 neutralizing antibodies are compromised by their risk of antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE) and unfavorably large size for intranasal delivery. To avoid these limitations, we demonstrated an aptamer blocking strategy by engineering aptamers’ binding to the region on S(RBD) that directly mediates ACE2 receptor engagement, leading to block SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. With aptamer selection against S(RBD) and molecular docking, aptamer CoV2‐6 was identified and applied to prevent, compete with, and substitute ACE2 from binding to S(RBD). CoV2‐6 was further shortened and engineered as a circular bivalent aptamer CoV2‐6C3 (cb‐CoV2‐6C3) to improve the stability, affinity, and inhibition efficacy. cb‐CoV2‐6C3 is stable in serum for more than 12 h and can be stored at room temperature for more than 14 days. Furthermore, cb‐CoV2‐6C3 binds to S(RBD) with high affinity (K (d)=0.13 nM) and blocks authentic SARS‐CoV‐2 virus with an IC(50) of 0.42 nM.","Sun, Miao; Liu, Siwen; Wei, Xinyu; Wan, Shuang; Huang, Mengjiao; Song, Ting; Lu, Yao; Weng, Xiaonan; Lin, Zhu; Chen, Honglin; Song, Yanling; Yang, Chaoyong",Angew Chem Int Ed Engl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33561300/; https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202100225,571

Using the available data, since its first reported case on 16 March 2020, we seek to develop a predicative tool for the cumulative number of reported cases and the number of active cases in Lagos; we also estimate the basic reproduction number of the disease outbreak in the aforementioned State in Nigeria. Using numerical simulations, we show the effect of control measures, specifically the common social distancing, use of face mask and case detection (via contact tracing and subsequent testings) on the dynamics of COVID-19. We also provide forecasts for the cumulative number of reported cases and active cases for different levels of the control measures being implemented. Numerical simulations of the model show that if at least 55% of the population comply with the social distancing regulation with about 55% of the population effectively making use of face masks while in public, the disease will eventually die out in the population and that, if we can step up the case detection rate for symptomatic individuals to about 0.8 per day, with about 55% of the population complying with the social distancing regulations, it will lead to a great decrease in the incidence (and prevalence) of COVID-19.","Okuonghae, D.; Omame, A.",Chaos Solitons Fractals,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834593/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920304306?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077920304306,571

Sepsis is a characteristic of organ failure related to microcirculation disorders resulting from endothelial cell injury, whose most frequent comorbidity in patients is DM. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of infection on DM-induced microvascular damage on inflammation and pulmonary endothelial structure using an experimental endotoxemia model. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 15 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally into 10-week-old male C57BLKS/J Iar(- +) lepr(db)/lepr(db) (db/db) mice and into C57BLKS/J Iar(–)m (+) / + lepr(db) (db/ +) mice, which served as the littermate non-diabetic control. At 48 h after LPS administration, the survival rate of db/db mice (0%, 0/10) was markedly lower (P < 0.05) than that of the db/ + mice (75%, 18/24), whereas the survival rate was 100% in both groups 24 h after LPS administration. In control mice, CD11b-positive cells increased at 6 h after LPS administration; by comparison, the number of CD11b-positive cells increased gradually in db/db mice until 12 h after LPS injection. In the control group, the number of Iba-1-positive cells did not significantly increase before and at 6, 12, and 24 h after LPS injection. Conversely, Iba-1-positive cells continued to increase until 24 h after LPS administration, and this increase was significantly greater than that in the control mice. Expression of Ext1, Csgalnact1, and Vcan related to endothelial glycocalyx synthesis was significantly lower in db/db mice than in the control mice before LPS administration, indicating that endothelial glycocalyx synthesis is attenuated in db/db/mice. In addition, ultrastructural analysis revealed that endothelial glycocalyx was thinner in db/db mice before LPS injection. In conclusion, in db/db mice, the endothelial glycocalyx is already injured before LPS administration, and migration of inflammatory cells is both delayed and expanded. This extended inflammation may be involved in endothelial glycocalyx damage due to the attenuation of endothelial glycocalyx synthesis.","Sampei, So; Okada, Hideshi; Tomita, Hiroyuki; Takada, Chihiro; Suzuki, Kodai; Kinoshita, Takamasa; Kobayashi, Ryo; Fukuda, Hirotsugu; Kawasaki, Yuki; Nishio, Ayane; Yano, Hirohisa; Muraki, Isamu; Fukuda, Yohei; Suzuki, Keiko; Miyazaki, Nagisa; Watanabe, Takatomo; Doi, Tomoaki; Yoshida, Takahiro; Suzuki, Akio; Yoshida, Shozo; Kushimoto, Shigeki; Ogura, Shinji",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.623582; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33869173/,571

One such other disease is tuberculosis (TB). All indications suggest that COVID-19-related diversions of healthcare resources and disruptions to public health programming will exacerbate the slower moving pandemic of TB. This is expected to set back TB elimination efforts by years. This is a prediction that is especially relevant to Canada, which has repeatedly failed to meet pre-set targets for the elimination of TB even before the COVID-19 pandemic began. A collaborative approach to achieve TB elimination, one that engages all care providers, has recently been emphasized by the STOP-TB Partnership. Among TB elimination strategies, frontline providers (e.g., family physicians, emergency room physicians, and others) are well positioned to identify candidates for the treatment of latent TB infection, and make the diagnosis of infection-spreading cases of TB in a timely manner, thereby interrupting forward-moving chains of transmission. Electronic medical records offer the promise of automating these processes.

Certain cutaneous Human Papillomaviruses seem to have a role as co-factors in the UV-induced carcinogenesis of the skin. The main mechanism of the tumorigenesis induced by Human Papillomaviruses is linked to the transforming activity of the viral E6 and E7 oncoproteins. However, other mechanisms, such as the gene expression control by specific microRNAs expression and deregulation of immune inflammatory mediators, may be important in the process of transformation. In this context, the release of Extracellular Vesicles with a specific cargo (microRNAs involved in tumorigenesis, mRNAs of viral oncoproteins, cytokines, chemokines) appears to play a key role.","Chiantore, Maria Vincenza; Mangino, Giorgio; Iuliano, Marco; Capriotti, Lorena; Di Bonito, Paola; Fiorucci, Gianna; Romeo, Giovanna",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31973992/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359610119301546; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cytogfr.2019.12.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359610119301546,571

Participants David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo, Benedict Cumberbatch, Stephen Hawking, Mark Zuckerberg, Oprah Winfrey, Homer Simpson, and Kermit the Frog were defined as index cases. We included contacts up to the fifth generation seeded from each index case and enrolled a total of 99 participants into the cohort. Main outcome measures Basic reproduction number R(0), serial interval of accepting the challenge, and odds ratios of associated risk factors based on fully observed nomination chains; R(0 )is a measure of transmissibility and is defined as the number of secondary cases generated by a single index in a fully susceptible population. Serial interval is the duration between onset of a primary case and onset of its secondary cases. Results Based on the empirical data and assuming a branching process we estimated a mean R(0) of 1.43 (95% confidence interval 1.23 to 1.65) and a mean serial interval for accepting the challenge of 2.1 days (median 1 day).

630862,A retrospective cluster analysis of COVID-19 cases by county,2020-11-12,"During aging the immune system (IS) undergoes remarkable changes that collectively are known as immunosenescence. It is a multifactorial and dynamic phenomenon that affects both natural and acquired immunity and plays a critical role in most chronic diseases in older people. For a long time, immunosenescence has been considered detrimental because it may lead to a low-grade, sterile chronic inflammation we proposed to call ""inflammaging"" and a progressive reduction in the ability to trigger effective antibody and cellular responses against infections and vaccinations. Recently, many scientists revised this negative meaning because it can be considered an essential adaptation/remodeling resulting from the lifelong immunological biography of single individuals from an evolutionary perspective. Inflammaging can be considered an adaptive process because it can trigger an anti-inflammatory response to counteract the age-related pro-inflammatory environment. Centenarians represent a valuable model to study the beneficial changes occurring in the IS with age. These extraordinary individuals reached the extreme limits of human life by slowing down the aging process and, in most cases, delaying, avoiding or surviving the major age-associated diseases. They indeed show a complex and heterogeneous phenotype determined by an improved ability to adapt and remodel in response to harmful stimuli. This review aims to point out the intimate relationship between immunosenescence and inflammaging and how these processes impact unsuccessful aging rather than longevity. We also describe the gut microbiota age-related changes as one of the significant triggers of inflammaging and the sex/gender differences in the immune system of the elderly, contributing to the sex/gender disparity in terms of epidemiology, pathophysiology, symptoms and severity of age-related diseases.

Therefore, the main goal of our study was to investigate the 3D structure of bovine herpesvirus 1 - encoded UL49.5 protein. The final structure of the inhibitor was established using circular dichroism (CD), 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and molecular dynamics (MD) in membrane mimetic environments. In NMR studies, UL49.5 was represented by two fragments: the extracellular region (residues 1–35) and the transmembrane-intracellular fragment (residues 36–75), displaying various functions during viral invasion. After the empirical structure determination, a molecular docking procedure was used to predict the complex of UL49.5 with the TAP heterodimer. Our results revealed that UL49.5 adopted a highly flexible membrane-proximal helical structure in the extracellular part. In the transmembrane region, we observed two short α-helices. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic part had an unordered structure. Finally, we propose three different orientations of UL49.5 in the complex with TAP.

Serologic conversion and SARS-CoV-2 infection or possible reinfection rates (cases per 10,000 person days) by antibody status at baseline and follow-up were assessed. RESULTS: In total, 6,510 HCWs were followed for a total of 1,285,395 person days (median follow-up, 216 days). For participants who had baseline and follow-up serology checked, 285 (6.1%) of the 4,681 seronegative participants at baseline seroconverted to positive at follow-up; 138 (48%) of the 263 who were seropositive at baseline were seronegative at follow-up. When analyzed by baseline serostatus alone, 519 (8.4%) of 6,194 baseline seronegative participants had a positive PCR after baseline serology testing (4.25 per 10,000 person days). Of 316 participants who were seropositive at baseline, 8 (2.5%) met criteria for possible SARS-CoV-2 reinfection (ie, PCR positive >90 days after baseline serology) during follow-up, a rate of 1.27 per 10,000 days at risk. The adjusted rate ratio for possible reinfection in baseline seropositive compared to infection in baseline seronegative participants was 0.26 (95% confidence interval, 0.13–0.53). CONCLUSIONS: Seropositivity in HCWs is associated with moderate protection from future SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Wilkins, John T.; Hirschhorn, Lisa R.; Gray, Elizabeth L.; Wallia, Amisha; Carnethon, Mercedes; Zembower, Teresa R.; Ho, Joyce; DeYoung, Benjamin J.; Zhu, Alex; Rasmussen-Torvik, Laura J.; Taiwo, Babafemi; Evans, Charlesnika T.",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369331/; https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2021.367,571

632234,COVID-19 and the Paris Agreement target: A CGE analysis of alternative economic recovery scenarios for India(),2021-08-30,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses (e.g., 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV) are phylogenetically distantly related, but both are capable of infecting human hosts via the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and cause similar clinical and pathological features, suggesting their phenotypic convergence. Yet, the molecular basis that underlies their phenotypic convergence remains unknown. Here, we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their phenotypic convergence. Our genome-level analyses show that the spike protein, which is responsible for receptor binding, has undergone significant Darwinian selection along the branches related to 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary convergent amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV clades, leading to the phylogenetic uniting of their RBD protein sequences. In addition to the spike protein, we also find the evolutionary convergence of its partner protein, ORF3a, suggesting their possible co-evolutionary convergence. Our results demonstrate a strong adaptive evolutionary convergence between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV, possibly facilitating their adaptation to similar or identical receptors. Finally, it should be noted that many observed bat SARS-like CoVs that have an evolutionary convergent RBD sequence with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may be pre-adapted to human host receptor ACE2, and hence would be potential new coronavirus sources to infect humans in the future.","Wu, Yonghua",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.975995,571

The association between clinical characteristics of disease and formation of neutralizing antibodies have not well studied. A prospective study was conducted for patients recovered from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections from 1st August 2020 to 28th February 2021, to study the association between SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody response titres and clinical characteristics of the disease. A total 92 patients were included in the study. Median age was 52 years; majority were male and middle or old aged. About 48% patients required hospitalization and 38.3% had moderate CT severity score. Positive SARS-CoV-2-IgG was detected in all patients except one. On comparing the antibody titres among various sub-groups of COVID-19 recovered patients, old age was the only factor associated with statistically significant higher antibody response (28 AU/ml for age<35 years, 53 AU/ml for age group 35-60, and 71 AU/ml for age group >60 years, p value=0.01). Severity of infection, worse CT severity scores, need of hospitalization, oxygen or ventilatory support were associated with higher antibody titres but were not statistically significant. There was a strong correlation of antibody titres when analysed for age of study population (Spearman correlation=0.39, p value <0.001); whereas a weak correlation (Spearman correlation=0.03, p value 0.753) was seen when analysed for CT severity score. Elderly patients had higher antibody titre after recovery from Covid-19 infection. Severity of disease, need of hospitalisation or oxygen/mechanical ventilation did not influence the antibody titre.","Singh, Rakendra; Iyer, Hariharan; Kaur, Mansimranjit; Surbhi, Surbhi; Jindal, Ashish; Singh, Saranpal; Bansal, Avtar Singh; Sati, Hem C; Jindal, Vinita",Monaldi arch. chest dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34585560/; https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2021.1943,571

The recent emergence and rapid spread of several SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying multiple Spike mutations raise concerns about possible immune escape. One variant, first identified in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7, also called 501Y.V1 or 20I), contains eight Spike mutations with potential to impact antibody therapy, vaccine efficacy and risk of reinfection. Here we show that B.1.1.7 remains sensitive to neutralization, albeit at moderately reduced levels (∼2-fold), by serum samples from convalescent individuals and recipients of an mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1273, (Moderna) and a protein nanoparticle vaccine (NVX-CoV2373, Novavax). A subset of monoclonal antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike are less effective against the variant while others are largely unaffected. These findings indicate that variant B.1.1.7 is unlikely to be a major concern for current vaccines or for an increased risk of reinfection.","Shen, Xiaoying; Tang, Haili; McDanal, Charlene; Wagh, Kshitij; Fischer, William; Theiler, James; Yoon, Hyejin; Li, Dapeng; Haynes, Barton F.; Sanders, Kevin O.; Gnanakaran, Sandrasegaram; Hengartner, Nick; Pajon, Rolando; Smith, Gale; Glenn, Gregory M.; Korber, Bette; Montefiori, David C.",Cell Host Microbe,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312821001025?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2021.03.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312821001025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33705729/,571

This market was liberalised in 1991 and the new market-oriented policy was not challenged by the post-apartheid regime. Flag-carrier South African Airways (SAA) has lost its virtual monopoly, and thus significant volumes and market share, although its decrease is smaller if one considers its regional affiliates and subsidiary. Conversely, low-cost airlines have literally boomed, while British Airways has penetrated the market through a franchise agreement with Comair. Route networks by airline show various patterns. The low-cost carriers tend to concentrate on South Africa's Golden Triangle, while SAA regional affiliates mostly serve thin routes without competitors. Furthermore, the rise of low-cost airlines has led to the utilisation of a secondary airport in Johannesburg, the only African city with a multiple-airport system. Finally, our results are interpreted in light of South Africa's geography, intermodal options and social-political issues.","Charlier, Jacques; Dobruszkes, Frédéric",J Transp Geogr,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0966692320300867; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834674/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2020.102795; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692320300867,571

The genes for 5 of the identified proteins, 22L (putative helicase), 118L, 142R (putative RNaseIII), 274L (major capsid protein) and 295L, are shared by all iridoviruses for which the complete nucleotide sequence is known and may therefore be considered as iridovirus core genes. Three identified proteins have homologs only in ascoviruses. The remaining 15 identified proteins are so far unique to CIV.

633485,Forecasting COVID-19 and Analyzing the Effect of Government Interventions,2020-06-24,"Connecting basic data about bats and other potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2 with their ecological context is crucial to the understanding of the emergence and spread of the virus. However, when lockdowns in many countries started in March, 2020, the world's bat experts were locked out of their research laboratories, which in turn impeded access to large volumes of offline ecological and taxonomic data. Pandemic lockdowns have brought to attention the long-standing problem of so-called biological dark data: data that are published, but disconnected from digital knowledge resources and thus unavailable for high-throughput analysis. Knowledge of host-to-virus ecological interactions will be biased until this challenge is addressed. In this Viewpoint, we outline two viable solutions: first, in the short term, to interconnect published data about host organisms, viruses, and other pathogens; and second, to shift the publishing framework beyond unstructured text (the so-called PDF prison) to labelled networks of digital knowledge. As the indexing system for biodiversity data, biological taxonomy is foundational to both solutions. Building digitally connected knowledge graphs of host–pathogen interactions will establish the agility needed to quickly identify reservoir hosts of novel zoonoses, allow for more robust predictions of emergence, and thereby strengthen human and planetary health systems.","Upham, Nathan S; Poelen, Jorrit H; Paul, Deborah; Groom, Quentin J; Simmons, Nancy B; Vanhove, Maarten P M; Bertolino, Sandro; Reeder, DeeAnn M; Bastos-Silveira, Cristiane; Sen, Atriya; Sterner, Beckett; Franz, Nico M; Guidoti, Marcus; Penev, Lyubomir; Agosti, Donat",Lancet Planet Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/s2542-5196(21)00196-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34562356/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542519621001960; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2542519621001960,571

Social isolation is known to have a significant psychological impact, potentially triggering alcohol misuse in adults. In our study, we aimed to investigate the effect of COVID-19 lockdown measures on alcohol consumption in adults in Bavaria. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled 2067 participants, with 1961 young adults (mean age 23.3 ± 4.1) and 106 mature adults (mean age 66.7 ± 9.7). Participants were asked to complete a standardized questionnaire, semi-quantitatively evaluating the alcohol drinking behaviour before and during the pandemic lockdown. RESULTS: After implementation of lockdown, the alteration of alcohol consumption was significantly different between young and mature adults (p < 0.001). Among young adults, 42% reported unchanged drinking behaviour compared to 76% in the mature adult group; 44% of young adults reported to drink less compared to only 7% of mature adults. An increase in alcohol consumption was only reported by 14% of young adults and 17% of mature adults. Interestingly, in the entire cohort, the change of alcohol intake was most pronounced among moderate drinkers (> 0 to < 5 drinks/week) in both age groups (p < 0.001). Ordinal logistic regression revealed female sex, low BMI and younger age to be associated with a decrease in number of self-reported drinks/week. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown significantly affected alcohol drinking behaviour. Further studies exploring long-term effects on potential alcohol misuse and the relevance on public health are warranted.

This infodemic also included sensational and distorted information about drugs that likely first influenced opinion leaders and people particularly active on social media and then other people, thus affecting choices by individual patients everywhere. In particular, information has spread about some drugs approved for other indications (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, favipiravir, and umifenovir) that could have led to inappropriate and therefore hazardous use. In this article, we analyze the rationale behind the claims for use of these drugs in COVID-19, the communication about their effects on the disease, the consequences of this communication on people’s behavior, and the responses of some influential regulatory authorities in an attempt to minimize the actual or potential risks arising from this behavior. Finally, we discuss the role of pharmacovigilance stakeholders in emergency management and possible strategies to deal with other similar crises in the future.","Tuccori, Marco; Convertino, Irma; Ferraro, Sara; Cappello, Emiliano; Valdiserra, Giulia; Focosi, Daniele; Blandizzi, Corrado",Drug Saf,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40264-020-00965-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32572842/,571

637023,Plasma Lectin Pathway Complement Proteins in Patients With COVID-19 and Renal Disease,2021-04-29,"Background Queensland, Australia has been successful in containing the COVID-19 pandemic. Underpinning that response has been a highly effective virus containment strategy which relies on identification, isolation, and contact tracing of cases. The dramatic emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic rendered traditional paper-based systems for managing contact tracing no longer fit for purpose. A rapid digital transformation of the public health contact tracing system occurred to support this effort. Objectives The objectives of the digital transformation were to shift legacy systems (paper or standalone electronic systems) to a digitally enabled public health system, where data are centered around the consumer rather than isolated databases. The objective of this paper is to outline this case study and detail the lessons learnt to inform and give confidence to others contemplating digitization of public health systems in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This case study is set in Queensland, Australia. Universal health care is available. A multidisciplinary team was established consisting of clinical informaticians, developers, data strategists, and health information managers. An agile “pair-programming” approach was undertaken to application development and extensive change efforts were made to maximize adoption of the new digital workflows. Data governance and flows were changed to support rapid management of the pandemic. Results The digital coronavirus application (DCOVA) is a web-based application that securely captures information about people required to quarantine and creates a multiagency secure database to support a successful containment strategy. Conclusion Most of the literature surrounding digital transformation allows time for significant consultation, which was simply not possible under crisis conditions. Our observation is that staff was willing to adopt new digital systems because the reason for change (the COVID-19 pandemic) was clearly pressing. This case study highlights just how critical a unified purpose, is to successful, rapid digital transformation.","Sullivan, Clair; Wong, Ides; Adams, Emily; Fahim, Magid; Fraser, Jon; Ranatunga, Gihan; Busato, Matthew; McNeil, Keith",Appl Clin Inform,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1725186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763847/,571

In the United States, it is the leading cause of death, representing a bigger risk factor than even smoking. For many, education on a healthy diet comes from their physician. However, as few as 25% of medical schools currently offer a dedicated nutrition course. We hypothesized that an active learning, culinary nutrition experience for medical students would improve the quality of their diets and better equip them to counsel future patients on food and nutrition. METHODS: This was a prospective, interventional, uncontrolled, non-randomized, pilot study. Ten first-year medical students at the Wayne State University School of Medicine completed a 4-part, 8-h course in culinary-nutritional instruction and hands-on cooking. Online assessment surveys were completed immediately prior to, immediately following, and 2 months after the intervention. There was a 100% retention rate and 98.8% item-completion rate on the questionnaires. The primary outcome was changes in attitudes regarding counselling patients on a healthy diet. Secondary outcomes included changes in dietary habits and acquisition of culinary knowledge. Average within-person change between timepoints was determined using ordinary least squares fixed-effect models. Statistical significance was defined as P ≤ .05. RESULTS: Participants felt better prepared to counsel patients on a healthy diet immediately post-intervention (coefficient = 2.8; 95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 4.0 points; P < .001) and 2 months later (2.2 [1.0, 3.4]; P = .002). Scores on the objective test of culinary knowledge increased immediately after (3.6 [2.4, 4.9]; P < .001) and 2 months after (1.6 [0.4, 2.9]; P = .01) the intervention. Two months post-intervention, participants reported that a higher percentage of their meals were homemade compared to pre-intervention (13.7 [2.1, 25.3]; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: An experiential culinary nutrition course may improve medical students’ readiness to provide dietary counselling. Further research will be necessary to determine what effects such interventions may have on the quality of participants’ own diets.

The Qatar case study illustrates the importance of research in the development of health policy. It provides description of a series of projects that have been undertaken in relevant national areas such as autism, dementia, genomics, palliative care and patient safety. The paper discourse draws attention to investment requirement in health research systems to respond to country national health priorities and to strengthen public health policies for improving health and social outcomes by narrowing the gap between research and politics. In short, the discussion highlights the following: i) health is a human right marching towards universal health care, with research underpinning every advance in health care and quality medical services; ii) evidence-based research is emerging as a critical tool to aid policy- and decision-makers; iii) investment necessity in healthcare research/systems to enable responding to a country’s national health priorities and to strengthen public health policies; and iv) need for multi-sectoral involvement of stakeholders to bridge the gap between research and politics. Finally, atypical stakeholders’ engagement and bond to politics is a prerequisite to achieve healthcare objectives and policy success so as to reap the benefits of public health results.","Qoronfleh, M.

Balanced regulation of cell death and inflammatory immune responses is essential to promote protection against coronavirus infection; however, the underlying mechanisms that control these processes remain to be resolved. Here we demonstrate that infection with the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) activated the NLRP3 inflammasome and inflammatory cell death in the form of PANoptosis. Deleting NLRP3 inflammasome components or the downstream cell death executioner gasdermin D (GSDMD) led to an initial reduction in cell death followed by a robust increase in the incidence of caspase-8– and receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)–mediated inflammatory cell deathafter coronavirus infection. Additionally, loss of GSDMD promoted robust NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Moreover, the amounts of some cytokines released during coronavirus infection were significantly altered in the absence of GSDMD. Altogether, our findings show that inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, is induced by coronavirus infection and that impaired NLRP3 inflammasome function or pyroptosis can lead to negative consequences for the host. These findings may have important implications for studies of coronavirus-induced disease.","Zheng, Min; Williams, Evan Peter; Malireddi, R. K.

639178,COVID-19 Story From an IRB Member and Administrator,2021,"The attenuation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, at least in Italy, allows a gradual resumption of diagnostic and therapeutic activities for sleep respiratory disorders. The knowledge on this new disorder is growing fast, but our experience is still limited and when a physician cannot rely on evidence-based medicine, the experience of his peers can support the decision-making and operational process of reopening sleep laboratories. The aim of this paper is to focus on the safety of patients and operators accessing hospitals and the practice of diagnosing and treating sleep-related respiratory disorders. The whole process requires a careful plan, starting with a triage preceding the access to the facility, to minimize the risk of infection. Preparation of the medical record can be performed through standard questionnaires administered over the phone or by e-mail, including an assessment of the COVID-19 risk. The home sleep test should include single-patient sensors or easy-to-sanitize material. The use of nasal cannulas is discouraged in view of the risk of the virus colonizing the internal reading chamber, since no filter has been tested and certified to be used extensively for coronavirus due to its small size. The adaptation to positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment can also be performed mainly using telemedicine procedures. In the adaptation session, the mask should be new or correctly sanitized and the PAP device, without a humidifier, should be protected by an antibacterial/antiviral filter, then sanitized and reassigned after at least 4 days since SARS-CoV-2 was detected on some surfaces up to 72 h after. Identification of pressure should preferably be performed by telemedicine. The patient should be informed of the risk of spreading the disease in the family environment through droplets and how to reduce this risk. The follow-up phase can again be performed mainly by telemedicine both for problem solving and the collection of data. Public access to hospital should be minimized and granted to patients only. Constant monitoring of institutional communications will help in implementing the necessary recommendations.","Insalaco, Giuseppe; Dal Farra, Fabrizio; Braghiroli, Alberto; Salvaggio, Adriana",Respiration,https://doi.org/10.1159/000510825; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32854106/,571

Methods Ecological analysis using COVID-19 related mortality rates occurring by 24th April 2020, and ethnic composition of the population, across local authorities in England and Wales. Account is taken of age, population density, area deprivation and pollution. Results For every 1% rise in proportion of the population who are ethnic minority, COVID-19 related deaths increased by 5.10 (3.99 to 6.21) per million. This rise is present for each ethnic minority category examined. The size of this increase is a little reduced in a fully adjusted model, suggesting that some of the association results from ethnic minority people living in more densely populated, more polluted and more deprived areas. This estimate suggests that the average England and Wales COVID-19 related death rate would rise by 25% in a local authority with twice the average number of ethnic minority people. Discussion We find clear evidence that rates of COVID-19 related mortality within a local authority increase as the proportion of the population who are ethnic minority increases. We suggest that this is a consequence of social and economic inequalities, including among key workers, driven by entrenched structural and institutional racism and racial discrimination. We argue that these factors should be central to any investigation of ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 outcomes.","Nazroo, J.; Becares, L.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.08.20125153; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.08.20125153v1?rss=1,571
639910,COVID-19 vaccine roll-out in middle-income countries: lessons learned from the Jordan experience,2021-06-29,"Lung diseases affect millions of individuals all over the world. Various environmental factors, such as toxins, chemical pollutants, detergents, viruses, bacteria, microbial dysbiosis, and allergens, contribute to the development of respiratory disorders. Exposure to these factors activates stress responses in host cells and disrupt lung homeostasis, therefore leading to dysfunctional epithelial barriers. Despite significant advances in therapeutic treatments for lung diseases in the last two decades, novel interventional targets are imperative, considering the side effects and limited efficacy in patients treated with currently available drugs. Nutrients, such as amino acids (e.g., arginine, glutamine, glycine, proline, taurine, and tryptophan), peptides, and bioactive molecules, have attracted more and more attention due to their abilities to reduce oxidative stress, inhibit apoptosis, and regulate immune responses, thereby improving epithelial barriers. In this review, we summarize recent advances in amino acid metabolism in the lungs, as well as multifaceted functions of amino acids in attenuating inflammatory lung diseases based on data from studies with both human patients and animal models. The underlying mechanisms for the effects of physiological amino acids are likely complex and involve cell signaling, gene expression, and anti-oxidative reactions. The beneficial effects of amino acids are expected to improve the respiratory health and well-being of humans and other animals. Because viruses (e.g., coronavirus) and environmental pollutants (e.g., PM2.5 particles) induce severe damage to the lungs, it is important to determine whether dietary supplementation or intravenous administration of individual functional amino acids (e.g., arginine-HCl, citrulline, N-acetylcysteine, glutamine, glycine, proline and tryptophan) or their combinations to affected subjects may alleviate injury and dysfunction in this vital organ.","Chen, Jingqing; Jin, Yuhang; Yang, Ying; Wu, Zhenlong; Wu, Guoyao",Amino Acids in Nutrition and Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32761570/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-45328-2_4,571

For members of vulnerable migrant groups, systemic inequalities and structural forms of marginalisation and exclusion create health risks, impede access to needed care and interfere with the ability to achieve one’s full potential. Migrants often have limited access to healthcare, and they frequently are portrayed as less deserving than others of the resources needed to lead a healthy and flourishing life. Under these circumstances, clinicians, healthcare institutions and global health organisations have a moral and ethical obligation to consider the role they can—and do—play in either advancing or impeding migrants’ health and their capacity to flourish. Drawing on case studies from three world regions, we propose concrete steps clinicians and health institutions can take in order to better serve migrant patients. These include recommendations that can help improve understanding of the complex circumstances of migrants’ lives, strengthen collaboration between care providers and non-medical partners and transform the social, economic and structural circumstances that impede flourishing and harm health. Developing new strategies to promote the flourishing of precarious migrants can strengthen our collective ability to re-envision and redesign health systems and structures to value the health, dignity and bodily integrity of all patients—especially the most vulnerable—and to promote flourishing for all.","Willen, Sarah S; Selim, Nasima; Mendenhall, Emily; Lopez, Miriam Magaña; Chowdhury, Shahanoor Akter; Dilger, Hansjörg",BMJ Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827796/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-005108,571
640872,How COVID-19 has transformed my science,2021-08-06,"INTRODUCTION: It is unclear whether polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) should be considered an inflammatory disease or an autoimmune disease. METHODS: Eighteen untreated early PMR patients and 18 sex- and age-matched healthy controls (HCs) were included. PMR patients received tocilizumab from week 0 to week 12 and glucocorticoids from week 12 to week 24. Leukocytes, neutrophils, platelets, hemoglobin, γ-globulins, IgG, IgA, and IgM were compared between the PMR patients and HCs and before and after tocilizumab treatment in the PMR group. RESULTS: The mean age was 68 ± 7 and 66 ± 11 years, and the mean serum C-reactive protein level was 82 ± 16 and 5 ± 2 mg/l for PMR patients and HCs, respectively. At inclusion, leukocytes (p < 0.0001), neutrophils (p < 0.0001), and platelets (p < 0.0001) were increased and hemoglobin (p < 0.0001) decreased in the PMR group compared to the HC group. After tocilizumab therapy, leukocytes, neutrophils, and platelets decreased, and hemoglobin increased. At inclusion, all four parameters were significantly associated with the serum IL-6 level, though it was not associated after tocilizumab therapy. Levels of γ-globulin were increased in the PMR patients compared to HCs (p = 0.0087), and PMR patients with γ-globulins levels over 11 g/l at inclusion responded more quickly to tocilizumab therapy. Autoantibody profiles did not differ between the PMR patients and HCs. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that PMR is more an inflammatory disease than an autoimmune disease. Tocilizumab improves all markers of inflammation. Patients with elevated γ-globulins respond more quickly to tocilizumab.

641880,Midwifery education in COVID-19- time: Challenges and opportunities,2020-06-01,"Supply chains enable the flow of goods and services within economic systems. When mapped for the entire economy and geographic locations of a country, supply chains form a spatial web of interactions among suppliers and buyers. One way to characterize supply chains is through multiregional input-output linkages. Using a multiregional input-output dataset, we build the multilayer network of supply chains in the United States. Together with a network cascade model, the multilayer network is used to explore the propagation of economic shocks along intranational supply chains. We find that the effect of economic shocks, measured using the avalanche size or total number of collapsed nodes, varies widely depending on the geographic location and economic sector of origin of a shock. The response of the supply chains to shocks reveals a threshold-like behavior. Below a certain failure or fragility level, the avalanche size increases relatively quickly for any node in the network. Based on this result, we find that the most fragile regions tend to be located in the central United States, which are regions that tend to specialize in food production and manufacturing. The most fragile layers are chemical and pharmaceutical products, services and food-related products, which are all sectors that have been disrupted by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States. The fragility risk, measured by the intersection of the fragility level of a node and its exposure to shocks, varies across regions and sectors. This suggests that interventions aiming to make the supply-chain network more robust to shocks are likely needed at multiple levels of network aggregation.","Gomez, Michael; Garcia, Susana; Rajtmajer, Sarah; Grady, Caitlin; Mejia, Alfonso",Appl Netw Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32984501/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-020-00310-1,571

Disaster after-action reviews are an established emergency management practice to acquire knowledge through a process of analysing what happened and why, to improve the emergency response before the next crisis. After-action reviews help individuals and organisations learn, and are an essential step in the preparedness cycle. Human and animal health authorities have begun to employ after-action reviews for disaster preparedness and response among public health and Veterinary Services. The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) encourages Members to establish after-action reviews and share best practice. The adoption of afteraction review is an essential step for all provincial, national and multinational emergency management authorities to mitigate the impact of disasters on human and animal health. Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases with pandemic potential pose unique preparedness challenges, requiring high-level policy attention to close long-standing gaps. A review of after-action reports from the 2001 anthrax bioterror attacks and of naturally occurring infectious disease crises, from the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to the 2014 Ebola epidemic, reveal a similar pattern of repeated weakness and failures. These phenomena are described as 'lessons observed but not lessons learned'. Most infectious disease outbreaks with pandemic potential are zoonotic and require a One Health approach to prevent, prepare for and respond to global health security crises. After-action reviews in a One Health security context are essential to improve the pandemic preparedness of public health and Veterinary Services. After-action reviews can also provide the evidence-based 'feedback loop' needed to galvanise public policy and political will to translate lessons observed into sustained and applied lessons learned.","Parker, G W",Rev Sci Tech,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33046918/; https://doi.org/10.20506/rst.39.2.3108,571

We hypothesised that the widespread use of inhaled glucocorticoids was responsible for this finding and tested if inhaled glucorticoids would be an effective treatment for early COVID-19 illness. Methods We conducted a randomised, open label trial of inhaled budesonide, compared to usual care, in adults within 7 days of the onset of mild Covid-19 symptoms. The primary end point was COVID-19-related urgent care visit, emergency department assessment or hospitalisation. The trial was stopped early after independent statistical review concluded that study outcome would not change with further participant enrolment. Results 146 patients underwent randomisation. For the per protocol population (n=139), the primary outcome occurred in 10 participants and 1 participant in the usual care and budesonide arms respectively (difference in proportion 0.131, p=0.004). The number needed to treat with inhaled budesonide to reduce COVID-19 deterioration was 8. Clinical recovery was 1 day shorter in the budesonide arm compared to the usual care arm (median of 7 days versus 8 days respectively, logrank test p=0.007). Proportion of days with a fever and proportion of participants with at least 1 day of fever was lower in the budesonide arm. Fewer participants randomised to budesonide had persistent symptoms at day 14 and day 28 compared to participants receiving usual care.

RECENT FINDINGS: Localized, single-organ vasculitides encompass a group of rare conditions in which there is no evidence of concomitant systemic vasculitis. Most data on this topic derives from case reports and small case series. Although some aspects of these diseases, such as clinical manifestations and histologic findings, have already been extensively investigated, there is still a lack of robust data concerning the pathogenesis, epidemiology, and treatment. SUMMARY: Localized vasculitides may have a wide range of clinical features depending on the organ affected. The inflammatory process may have a multifocal/diffuse or unifocal distribution. Diagnosis is usually based on histopathology findings and exclusion of systemic vasculitis, which may frequently pose a challenge.

Our aim was to investigate sex differences in risk factors, etiology, and diagnostic process of ischemic stroke in Chinese young adults. METHODS: We retrospectively recruited 411 consecutive patients with first-ever ischemic stroke who were 18 to 50 years of age (mean age, 38.2 ± 8.1 years, women 31.4%), admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 2007 to 2018. Sex differences in demographics, risk factors, etiology, and diagnostic testing were analyzed. RESULTS: Females were significantly younger than males (36.9 versus 38.7 years, P<0.05). Hypertension (43.0%), smoking (41.1%), hyperlipidemia (37.2%), and hyperhomocysteinemia (27.9%) were common risk factors, statistically higher among males than females (P<0.05). Stroke etiology showed a significant sex difference that large-artery atherosclerosis and small-vessel diseases were more common among males than females (48.6% versus 19.4%, P<0.001; 9.9% versus 3.1%, P<0.05, respectively).

Therefore, the identification of lipids and metabolic pathways that are suitable targets for antiviral development is crucial. Using a library of compounds targeting host lipid metabolic factors and testing them for their ability to block pseudorabies virus (PRV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection, we found that U18666A, a specific inhibitor of Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), is highly potent in suppressing the entry of diverse viruses including pseudotyped severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). NPC1 deficiency markedly attenuates viral growth by decreasing cholesterol abundance in the plasma membrane, thereby inhibiting the dynamics of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs), which are indispensable for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Significantly, exogenous cholesterol can complement the dynamics of CCPs, leading to efficient viral entry and infectivity. Administration of U18666A improves the survival and pathology of PRV- and influenza A virus-infected mice. Thus, our studies demonstrate a unique mechanism by which NPC1 inhibition achieves broad antiviral activity, indicating a potential new therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2, as well as other emerging viruses.

644405,Using PARIHS framework to design a community-based COVID-19 intervention in rural Ghana,2021-04-04,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Several studies have explored the role of the inflammatory cells and cytokines involved in the protection or pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019. Unfortunately, the results have been controversial, and further studies are needed to better understand not only the roles but also the balance of these parameters, which are crucial data to improve prevention and treatment. As COVID-19 has a well-determined phasic progression and rapidly deteriorates approximately seven days after the onset of symptoms, it is extremely necessary to detect the clinical signs that are predictive of the outcome as early as possible. To this end, in this preliminary study, we evaluated the data relating to the monocyte intracellular TNF-α expression and lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood collected from patients at admission and every day of hospitalization until day 7. Our findings point to a modulation of the different cellular mediators of the immune system, which probably play a key role in the outcome of the coronavirus disease 2019. ABSTRACT: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, “SARS-CoV-2”, was recognized as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Several studies have explored the changes and the role of inflammatory cells and cytokines in the immunopathogenesis of the disease, but until today, the results have been controversial. Based on these premises, we conducted a retrospective assessment of monocyte intracellular TNF-α expression (iTNF-α) and on the frequencies of lymphocyte sub-populations in twenty-five patients with moderate/severe COVID-19. We found lymphopenia in all COVID-19 infected subjects compared to healthy subjects. On initial observation, in patients with favorable outcomes, we detected a high absolute eosinophil count and a high CD4+/CD8+ T lymphocytes ratio, while in the Exitus Group, we observed high neutrophil and CD8+ T lymphocyte counts. During infection, in patients with favorable outcomes, we observed a rise in the lymphocyte count, in the monocyte and in Treg lymphocyte counts, and in the CD4+ and in CD8+ T lymphocytes count but a reduction in the CD4+/CD8+ T lymphocyte ratio. Instead, in the Exitus Group, we observed a reduction in the Treg lymphocyte counts and a decrease in iTNF-α expression. Our preliminary findings point to a modulation of the different cellular mediators of the immune system, which probably play a key role in the outcomes of COVID-19.","Madonna, Gabriele; Sale, Silvia; Capone, Mariaelena; De Falco, Chiara; Santocchio, Valentina; Di Matola, Tiziana; Fiorentino, Giuseppe; Pirozzi, Caterina; D’Antonio, Anna; Sabatino, Rocco; Atripaldi, Lidia; Atripaldi, Umberto; Raffone, Marcello; Curvietto, Marcello; Grimaldi, Antonio Maria; Vanella, Vito; Festino, Lucia; Scarpato, Luigi; Palla, Marco; Spatarella, Michela; Perna, Francesco; Cerino, Pellegrino; Botti, Gerardo; Parrella, Roberto; Montesarchio, Vincenzo; Ascierto, Paolo Antonio; Atripaldi, Luigi",Biology (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34439967/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10080735,571
644777,The impact of lockdown timing on COVID-19 transmission across US counties,2021-07-16,"Összefoglaló. A Helicobacter pylori továbbra is a világ legelterjedtebb fertőzése: prevalenciája a fejlődő országokban 70-80%, a fejlett országokban csökkenő tendenciát mutat. A dél-magyarországi véradókban a prevalencia 32%-ra csökkent. A migráció a befogadó ország számára a fertőzés fokozott kockázatával jár. A szövettani diagnózisban az immunhisztokémiai vizsgálat pontosabb a hagyományos Giemsa-festésnél. A mesterséges intelligencia érzékenysége a hagyományos endoszkópiáéval összehasonlítva 87%, pontossága 86%. Az újgenerációs szekvenálással lehetséges egy biopsziás mintából több antibiotikumérzékenység meghatározása. A Helicobacter pylori kezelésének európai regisztere kimutatta, hogy 2013 és 2018 között a bizmutalapú négyes vagy a 14 napos egyidejű négyes kezelések hatásosabbak, mint a hagyományos hármas kezelés, de elterjedésük igen lassú folyamat, jelentős földrajzi különbségekkel. Az új típusú koronavírus (SARS-CoV-2) felléphet Helicobacter pylori fertőzésben is, egymás kóros hatását felerősítve. A diagnosztikai módszerek korlátozottak. Protonpumpagátlók szedése növeli a COVID-19-fertőzés kockázatát és annak súlyos kimenetelét. Előzetesen ismert peptikus fekély, vérzés, illetve antikoguláns kezelés előtt az eradikáció a vírusos fertőzés lezajlása után indokolt. A probiotikumoknak az eradikációra gyakorolt hatásáról 20, közepes minőségű metaanalízis született, így a konszenzusokban foglalt álláspontok sem egyértelműek: a jövőben ezt tisztázni kell. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(32): 1275-1282. Summary. Helicobacter pylori is still the most widespread infection in the world: its overall prevalence is 70-80% in developing regions, but fortunately it is decreasing in the Western world. The prevalence in blood donors from South-Eastern Hungary decreased from 63% in the 1990's to 32% in 2019. Migration constitutes an increased risk of infection for the destination countries. Immunohistochemistry has proven to be more accurate in histological diagnosis than the conventional Giemsa stain. The sensitivity and accuracy of artificial intelligence as compared to videoendoscopy were 87% and 86%, respectively. The European Register on the management of Helicobacter pylori infection revealed that concomitant quadruple and 14-day bismuth-based therapies are more efficient than triple combinations, although their incorporation in practice is a long-lasting process, with large geographical variations. The novel type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) can also occur in Helicobacter pylori-infected patients, mutually enhancing their pathogenetic effects. Diagnostic possibilities are limited in this setting. The use of proton pump inhibitors increases the risk of viral infection and the severity of the disease. Eradication treatment seems justified in patients with previously known peptic ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding, or before starting anticoagulant treatment, but must be postponed after resolution of viral infection. The effect of probiotics on eradication was addressed by 20, medium-to-low quality meta-analyses and so, the recommendations of the guidelines are equivocal, which must be clarified in the future with higher quality studies.

645193,Rapid characterization of the propagation of COVID-19 in different countries,2020-06-11,"Several early models describing host–pathogen interaction have assumed that each individual host has approximately the same likelihood of becoming infected or of infecting others. More recently, a concept that has been increasingly emphasized in many studies is that for many infectious diseases, transmission is not homogeneous but highly skewed at the level of populations. In what became known as the ‘20/80 rule’, about 20% of the hosts in a population were found to contribute to about 80% of the transmission potential. These heterogeneities have been described for the interaction between many microorganisms and their human or animal hosts. Several epidemiological studies have reported transmission heterogeneities for Escherichia coli by cattle, a phenomenon with far-reaching agricultural, medical and public health implications. Focusing on E. coli as a case study, this paper will describe super-spreading and super-shedding by cattle, review the main factors that shape these transmission heterogeneities and examine the interface with human health. Escherichia coli super-shedding and super-spreading by cattle are shaped by microorganism-specific, cattle-specific and environmental factors. Understanding the factors that shape heterogeneities in E. coli dispersion by cattle and the implications for human health represent key components that are critical for targeted infection control initiatives.","Stein, Richard A.; Katz, David E.",FEMS Microbiol Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28333229/; https://doi.org/10.1093/femsle/fnx050,571

Polylactic acid (PLA), a polyester made from renewable natural resources, can be exploited for 3D printing of protective face masks using the Fused Deposition Modelling technique. Since the possible high porosity of this material raised questions regarding its suitability for protection against viruses, we have investigated its microstructure using scanning electron microscopy and aerosol generator and photometer certified as the test system according to the standards EN 143 and EN 149. Moreover, the efficiency of decontaminating PLA surfaces by conventional chemical disinfectants including 96% ethanol, 70% isopropanol, and a commercial disinfectant containing 0.85% sodium hypochlorite has been determined. We confirmed that the structure of PLA protective masks is compact and can be considered a sufficient barrier protection against particles of a size corresponding to microorganisms including viruses. Complete decontamination of PLA surfaces from externally applied Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans and SARS-CoV-2 was achieved using all disinfectants tested, and human adenovirus was completely inactivated by sodium hypochlorite-containing disinfectant. Natural contamination of PLA masks worn by test persons was decontaminated easily and efficiently by ethanol. No disinfectant caused major changes to the PLA surface properties, and the pore size did not change despite severe mechanical damage of the surface. Therefore, PLA may be regarded as a suitable material for 3D printing of protective masks during the current or future pandemic crises.","Vaňková, Eva; Kašparová, Petra; Khun, Josef; Machková, Anna; Julák, Jaroslav; Sláma, Michal; Hodek, Jan; Ulrychová, Lucie; Weber, Jan; Obrová, Klára; Kosulin, Karin; Lion, Thomas; Scholtz, Vladimír",PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33194427/,571

The impact of chronic neurological disorders (CND) on prognosis is unclear. We evaluated if the presence of CND in Covid-19 patients is a predictor of a higher in-hospital mortality. As secondary endpoints, we analyzed the association between CND, Covid-19 severity, and laboratory abnormalities during admission. Methods: Retrospective cohort study that included all the consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed Covid-19 disease from March 8th to April 11th, 2020. The study setting was Hospital Clínico, tertiary academic hospital from Valladolid. CND was defined as those neurological conditions causing permanent disability. We assessed demography, clinical variables, Covid-19 severity, laboratory parameters and outcome. The primary endpoint was in-hospital all-cause mortality, evaluated by multivariate cox-regression log rank test. We analyzed the association between CND, covid-19 severity and laboratory abnormalities. Results: We included 576 patients, 43.3% female, aged 67.2 years in mean. CND were present in 105 (18.3%) patients. Patients with CND were older, more disabled, had more vascular risk factors and comorbidities and fewer clinical symptoms of Covid-19. They presented 1.43 days earlier to the emergency department. Need of ventilation support was similar. Presence of CND was an independent predictor of death (HR 2.129, 95% CI: 1.382–3.280) but not a severer Covid-19 disease (OR: 1.75, 95% CI: 0.970–3.158). Frequency of laboratory abnormalities was similar, except for procalcitonin and INR. Conclusions: The presence of CND is an independent predictor of mortality in hospitalized Covid-19 patients. That was not explained neither by a worse immune response to Covid-19 nor by differences in the level of care received by patients with CND.","García-Azorín, David; Martínez-Pías, Enrique; Trigo, Javier; Hernández-Pérez, Isabel; Valle-Peñacoba, Gonzalo; Talavera, Blanca; Simón-Campo, Paula; de Lera, Mercedes; Chavarría-Miranda, Alba; López-Sanz, Cristina; Gutiérrez-Sánchez, María; Martínez-Velasco, Elena; Pedraza, María; Sierra, Álvaro; Gómez-Vicente, Beatriz; Guerrero, Ángel; Ezpeleta, David; Peñarrubia, María Jesús; Gómez-Herreras, Jose Ignacio; Bustamante-Munguira, Elena; Abad-Molina, Cristina; Orduña-Domingo, Antonio; Ruiz-Martin, Guadalupe; Jiménez-Cuenca, María Isabel; Juarros, Santiago; del Pozo-Vegas, Carlos; Dueñas-Gutierrez, Carlos; de Paula, Jose María Prieto; Cantón-Álvarez, Belén; Vicente, Jose Manuel; Arenillas, Juan Francisco",Front Neurol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.00781; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32733373/,571

We present an initial evaluation of self-reported pediatric surgical policy changes from hospitals across North America. METHODS: On March 30, 2020, an online open access, data gathering spreadsheet was made available to pediatric surgeons through the American Pediatric Surgical Association (APSA) website, which captured information surrounding COVID-19 related policy changes. Responses from the first month of the pandemic were collected. Open-ended responses were evaluated and categorized into themes and descriptive statistics were performed to identify areas of consensus. RESULTS: Responses from 38 hospitals were evaluated. Policy changes relating to three domains of program structure and care processes were identified: internal structure, clinical workflow, and COVID-19 safety/prevention. Inter-hospital consensus was high for reducing in-hospital staffing, limiting clinical fellow exposure, implementing telehealth for conducting outpatient clinical visits, and using universal precautions for trauma. Heterogeneity in practices existed for scheduling procedures, implementing testing protocols, and regulating use of personal protective equipment.

They include studies on the following: relationship of HSV1 to AD using neural stem cells; the apparent protective effects of treatment of HSV1 infection or of VZV infection with antivirals prior to the onset of dementia; the putative involvement of VZV in AD/dementia; the possible role of human herpes virus 6 (HHV6) in AD; the seemingly reduced risk of dementia after vaccination with diverse types of vaccine, and the association shown in some vaccine studies with reduced frequency of HSV1 reactivation; anti-HSV serum antibodies supporting the linkage of HSV1 in brain with AD in APOE-ε4 carriers, and the association between APOE and cognition, and association of APOE and infection with AD/dementia. The conclusions are that there is now overwhelming evidence for HSV1’s role—probably causal—in AD, when it is present in brain of APOE-ε4 carriers, and that further investigations should be made on possible prevention of the disease by vaccination, or by prolonged antiviral treatment of HSV1 infection in APOE-ε4 carriers, before disease onset.","Itzhaki, Ruth F.",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34205498/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9060679,571

647912,Symptoms and Clinical Outcomes of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in the Outpatient Setting,2021-01-14,"In recent years the global market for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) became a multi-billion-dollar business. This success is mainly driven by treatments in the oncology and autoimmune space. Instead, development of effective mAbs against infectious diseases has been lagging behind. For years the high production cost and limited efficacy have blocked broader application of mAbs in the infectious disease space, which instead has been dominated for almost a century by effective and cheap antibiotics and vaccines. Only very few mAbs against RSV, anthrax, Clostridium difficile or rabies have reached the market. This is about to change. The development of urgently needed and highly effective mAbs as preventive and therapeutic treatments against a variety of pathogens is gaining traction. Vast advances in mAb isolation, engineering and production have entirely shifted the cost-efficacy balance. MAbs against devastating diseases like Ebola, HIV and other complex pathogens are now within reach. This trend is further accelerated by ongoing or imminent health crises like COVID-19 and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), where antibodies could be the last resort. In this review we will retrace the history of antibodies from the times of serum therapy to modern mAbs and lay out how the current run for effective treatments against COVID-19 will lead to a quantum leap in scientific, technological and health care system innovation around mAb treatments for infectious diseases.","Pecetta, Simone; Finco, Oretta; Seubert, Anja",Semin Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smim.2020.101427; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1044532320300439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33277154/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044532320300439?v=s5,571
647988,The short-term effects of COVID-19 outbreak on dietary diversity and food security status of Iranian households (A case study in Tehran province),2020-10-06,"BACKGROUND: Obesity has been linked to severe clinical outcomes among people who are hospitalized with COVID-19. We tested the hypothesis that visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is associated with severe outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, independent of body mass index (BMI). METHODS: We analyzed data from the Massachusetts General Hospital COVID-19 Data Registry, which included patients admitted with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 11 - May 4, 2020. We used a validated, fully automated artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to quantify VAT from CT scans during or prior to the hospital admission. VAT quantification took an average 2±0.5 seconds per patient. We dichotomized VAT as high and low at a threshold of ≥100 cm(2) and used Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression to assess the relationship between VAT and death or intubation over 28 days, adjusting for age, sex, race, BMI and diabetes status. RESULTS: 378 participants had CT imaging. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that participants with high VAT had a greater risk of the outcome compared to those with low VAT (p<0.005), especially in those with BMI <30 kg/m (2) (p<0.005). In multivariable models, the aHR for high vs. low VAT was unchanged [aHR 1.97 (1.24 – 3.09)], whereas BMI was no longer significant [aHR for obese vs. normal BMI 1.14 (0.71 – 1.82)]. CONCLUSIONS: High VAT is associated with a greater risk of severe disease or death in COVID-19, and can offer more precise information to risk stratify individuals beyond BMI. AI offers a promising approach to routinely ascertain VAT and improve clinical risk prediction in COVID-19.","Goehler, Alexander; Tsu, Harry Tzu-Ming; Seiglie, Jacqueline A; Siedner, Mark J; Lo, Janet; Triant, Virginia; Hsu, John; Foulkes, Andrea; Bassett, Ingrid; Khorasani, Ramin; Wexler, Deborah J; Szolovits, Peter; Meigs, James B; Manne-Goehler, Jennifer",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34258315/,571

However, other modes of transmission also need to be clarified in more depth, especially, the foodborne transmission. We assessed the effect of animal origin foods consumption on the pandemic of COVID-19. For this purpose, we studied the relationship among 20 food supply as independent variables, and the parameter of Total Cases as dependent variable. Here we show a relationship between a group of animal origin foods and total cases. Regression, Bayes, and Lasso results showed that eggs and fresh water fish have positive coefficient. So, among the transmission ways of COVID_19, the role of foodborne transmission should be more significant than previously thought. The possibility of animal origin foodborne transmission should be taken into more consideration. The perspective is to expand the surveillance of SARS-Cov-2 during the food production chain. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that one important vehicle for SARS-Cov2 may be some of animal origin foods. It is recommended that virologists examine the possibility of freshwater fish and chickens eggs being as excellent vehicles/preservatives for SARS-Cov2.","Saeedi, Nazli; rafat, seyed",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.16.20132464; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.16.20132464v1?rss=1,571

The world was slow to react to the developing crisis, but once the contours of the impending calamity became evident, the different state and non-state actors have raced to put their act together. The COVID-19 outbreak has blatantly exposed the shortcomings of our healthcare system and the limitations of medical science, despite considerable advances in recent years. To effectively tackle the current epidemic, almost unprecedented in the modern era, there is an urgent need for a concerted, sustained, and coordinated effort towards the development of new diagnostics, therapeutic and vaccines, and the ramping up of the healthcare infrastructure, especially in the poorer, underprivileged nations. Towards this end, researchers around the world are working tirelessly to develop new diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. Efforts to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 are presently underway in several countries around the world, but a new vaccine is expected only by the end of the year-at the earliest. New drug development against COVID-19 and its approval may take even longer. Under such circumstances, drug repurposing has emerged as a realistic and effective strategy to counter the virus menace in the short run, and several antiviral and antimalarial medicines are currently in different stages of clinical trials. Researchers are also experimenting with nutrients, vitamins, monoclonal antibodies, and convalescent plasma as immunity boosters against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This report presents a critical analysis of the global clinical trial landscape for COVID-19 with an emphasis on the therapeutic agents and vaccines currently being tested at pandemic speed.","Ahamad, Shakir; Branch, Scotty; Harrelson, Shea; Hussain, Mohd Kamil; Saquib, Mohammad; Khan, Saeed",Eur J Med Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33070079/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2020.112862; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0223523420308345; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0223523420308345?v=s5,571
648519,Compliance of the Gulf Cooperation Council airlines with COVID-19 mitigation measures,2020-11-04,"OBJECTIVES: A number of studies have shown that the airborne transmission route could spread some viruses over a distance of 2 meters from an infected person. An epidemic model based only on respiratory droplets and close contact could not fully explain the regional differences in the spread of COVID-19 in Italy. On March 16th 2020, we presented a position paper proposing a research hypothesis concerning the association between higher mortality rates due to COVID-19 observed in Northern Italy and average concentrations of PM(10) exceeding a daily limit of 50 µg/m(3). METHODS: To monitor the spreading of COVID-19 in Italy from February 24th to March 13th (the date of the Italian lockdown), official daily data for PM(10) levels were collected from all Italian provinces between February 9th and February 29th, taking into account the maximum lag period (14 days) between the infection and diagnosis. In addition to the number of exceedances of the daily limit value of PM(10), we also considered population data and daily travelling information for each province. RESULTS: Exceedance of the daily limit value of PM(10) appears to be a significant predictor of infection in univariate analyses (p<0.001). Less polluted provinces had a median of 0.03 infections over 1000 residents, while the most polluted provinces showed a median of 0.26 cases. Thirty-nine out of 41 Northern Italian provinces resulted in the category with the highest PM(10) levels, while 62 out of 66 Southern provinces presented low PM(10) concentrations (p<0.001). In Milan, the average growth rate before the lockdown was significantly higher than in Rome (0.34 vs 0.27 per day, with a doubling time of 2.0 days vs 2.6, respectively), thus suggesting a basic reproductive number R(0)>6.0, comparable with the highest values estimated for China. CONCLUSION: A significant association has been found between the geographical distribution of daily PM(10) exceedances and the initial spreading of COVID-19 in the 110 Italian provinces.","Setti, Leonardo; Passarini, Fabrizio; De Gennaro, Gianluigi; Barbieri, Pierluigi; Licen, Sabina; Perrone, Maria Grazia; Piazzalunga, Andrea; Borelli, Massimo; Palmisani, Jolanda; Di Gilio, Alessia; Rizzo, Emanuele; Colao, Annamaria; Piscitelli, Prisco; Miani, Alessandro",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-039338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32973066/,571

METHOD: New referrals over 3 months from the National Diabetic Eye Screening programme (DESP) were screened. Patients who had both Clarus widefield imaging and macular OCT were included. All patients underwent slit lamp examination in clinic. Data obtained from electronic patient records included referral reason, DR grading and management plan. Two graders retrospectively reviewed imaging and formulated a management plan blinded to results from patients’ clinic visit. Results from virtual examination were compared with those from slit lamp examination. RESULTS: One-hundred and two eyes of 51 patients were assessed. 11 fundus photos from 7 patients and 15 fundus photos from 10 patients were deemed inadequate by grader G1 and G2, respectively. Eighteen (35%) patients and 11 (22%) patients from virtual assessment by G1 and G2, respectively were found to need a face a face appointment to aid diagnosis. Compared to slit lamp examination, 15% and 7.5% of patients from G1 and G2’s virtual assessment respectively had different proposed management plan. Agreement of DR grading between both virtual graders and slit lamp examination was fair (Kappa’s coefficient = 0.56). One case of slit lamp noted retinal neovascularization, which was graded as background retinopathy by DESP was also graded as such on virtual assessment. CONCLUSION: Widefield Clarus and OCT imaging allowed two-thirds of DESP referrals to be safely managed virtually.","Lim, Wei Sing; Grimaldi, Gabriela; Nicholson, Luke; Basheer, Khadijah; Rajendram, Ranjan",Eye (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33082533/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41433-020-01218-x,571
649044,Clipping of a ruptured middle cerebral artery aneurysm in a patient with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a case report,2020-07-29,"The reported incidence rate of venous and arterial thrombotic events in critically ill patients with COVID‐19 infections is high, ranging from 20% to 60%. We adopted a patient‐tailored thromboprophylaxis protocol based on clinical and laboratory presentations for these patients in our institution. We hypothesised that patients who received high‐intensity thromboprophylaxis treatment would experience fewer thrombotic events. The aims of our study were to explore the incidence of thrombotic events in this population; to assess independent factors associated with thrombotic events and to evaluate the incidence of haemorrhagic events. A retrospective review of all adult patients with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between 1 March and 29 May 2020 was performed. The primary outcome was a composite of venous and arterial thrombotic events diagnosed during the ICU stay. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the independent factors associated with thrombotic events. A total of 188 patients met the inclusion criteria. All received some type of thromboprophylaxis treatment except for six patients who did not receive any prophylaxis. Of the 182 patients who received thromboprophylaxis, 75 (40%) received high‐intensity thromboprophylaxis and 24 (12.8%) were treated with therapeutic anticoagulation. Twenty‐one patients (11.2%) experienced 23 thrombotic events (incidence rate of 12.2% (95%CI 7.9–17.8)), including 12 deep venous thromboses, 9 pulmonary emboli and 2 peripheral arterial thromboses. The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that only D‐dimer (OR 2.80, p = 0.002) and high‐intensity thromboprophylaxis regimen (OR 0.20, p = 0.01) were independently associated with thrombotic events. Thirty‐one patients (16.5%) experienced haemorrhagic events; among them, 13 were classified as major bleeding according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria. Therapeutic anticoagulation, but not the high‐intensity thromboprophylaxis regimen, was associated with major bleeding. A proactive approach to the management of thromboembolism in critically ill COVID‐19 patients utilising a high‐intensity thromboprophylaxis regimen in appropriately selected patients may result in lower thrombotic events without increasing the risk of bleeding.","Atallah, B.; Sadik, Z.

649386,Warmer weather and global trends in the coronavirus COVID-19,2020-05-05,"INTRODUCTION: Sexual violence is a significant public health concern in the United States, affecting as many as one in two women and one in four men. However, few medical schools offer education on trauma-informed communication with patients who disclose sexual assault (SA). The goal of this training was to provide medical students with an understanding of how to empathically respond to SA disclosures, collect pertinent medical information while avoiding retraumatization, and empower patients to feel in control of their care. METHODS: One hundred forty-nine second-year medical students at Rush Medical College attended a 1-hour didactic lecture discussing the needs of SA survivors followed by small-group sessions during which they practiced trauma-informed communication skills. Students completed anonymous pre- and postsession surveys featuring nine Likert-scale questions that assessed comfort level providing trauma-informed care. RESULTS: Of the 149 attendees, 88 (59%) completed matched pre- and posttraining surveys that demonstrated significant improvement in all assessed metrics of trauma-informed care, including comfort collecting information, empowering survivors, and responding to and normalizing patients’ concerns. Two weeks after completing the training, all 149 students also correctly answered a free-response question testing retention of key training takeaways on their Sexuality and Reproduction final exam. DISCUSSION: The training significantly improved medical student comfort in providing trauma-informed care across all collected metrics. The training can be feasibly reproduced at other institutions so that future physicians across specialties can provide trauma-informed care, ideally improving the acute and chronic health outcomes that disproportionately affect SA survivors.","Gore, Daniel J.; Prusky, Melissa; Solomon, Chloe J.

Mass media coverage of COVID-19 epidemic has been exceptional with more than 180,000 articles published each day in 70 languages from March 8 to April 8, 2020. One may well wonder if this massive media attention ever happened in the past and if it has been finally proven to be beneficial or even just appropriate. Surgical site and implant-related infections represent a substantial part of health care-associated infections; with an estimated overall incidence of 6% post-surgical infection, approximately 18 million new surgical site infections are expected each year globally, with 5 to 10% mortality rate and an astounding economic and social cost. In the current mediatic era, orthopaedic surgeons need to refocus some of their time and energies from surgery to communication and constructive research. Only raising mediatic awareness on surgical site and implant-related infections may tune up the volume of silent epidemics to a level that can become audible by governing institutions.","Romanò, Carlo Luca; Drago, Lorenzo; del Sel, Hernán; Johari, Ashok; Lob, Guenter; Mavrogenis, Andreas F.; Benzakour, Thami",Int Orthop,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32449044/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-020-04608-8,571

OM is also one of the most common ailments. In clinical practice, the diagnosis of OM is carried out by visual inspection of otoscope images. This vulnerable process is subjective and error-prone. METHODS: In this study, a novel computer-aided decision support model based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) has been developed. To improve the generalized ability of the proposed model, a combination of the channel and spatial model (CBAM), residual blocks, and hypercolumn technique is embedded into the proposed model. All experiments were performed on an open-access tympanic membrane dataset that consists of 956 otoscopes images collected into five classes. RESULTS: The proposed model yielded satisfactory classification achievement. The model ensured an overall accuracy of 98.26%, sensitivity of 97.68%, and specificity of 99.30%. The proposed model produced rather superior results compared to the pre-trained CNNs such as AlexNet, VGG-Nets, GoogLeNet, and ResNets. Consequently, this study points out that the CNN model equipped with the advanced image processing techniques is useful for OM diagnosis. The proposed model may help to field specialists in achieving objective and repeatable results, decreasing misdiagnosis rate, and supporting the decision-making processes.","Alhudhaif, Adi; Cömert, Zafer; Polat, Kemal",PeerJ Comput Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33817048/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.405,571

Methods: Online cross-sectional survey of a nationally-representative sample of 2240 participants living in the UK aged 18 years or over (data collected 6-7 May 2020). Participants were recruited from YouGov's online research panel. Outcomes: In this sample, 21.9% (n=458, 95% CI [20.1% to 23.7%]) reported probable anxiety (scored three or over on the GAD-2); while 23.5% (n=494, 95% CI [21.7% to 25.3]) reported probable depression (scored three or over on the PHQ-2). Poorer mental health was associated with greater financial hardship during the lockdown, thinking that you would lose contact with friends or family if you followed Government measures, more conflict with household members during the lockdown, less sense of community with people in your neighbourhood, and lower perceived effectiveness of Government measures. Females and those who were younger were likely to report higher levels of anxiety and depression. The majority of participants reported their general health as ""good"" (as measured by the first item of the SF-36). Poorer self-reported general health was associated with psychological distress, greater worry about COVID-19 and markers of inequality. Interpretation: Rates of self-reported anxiety and depression in the UK during the lockdown were greater than population norms. Reducing financial hardship, promoting social connectedness, and increasing solidarity with neighbours and household members may help ease rifts within the community which are associated with distress, thereby improving mental health. Reducing inequality may also improve general health.","Smith, L. E.; Amlot, R.; Lambert, H.; Oliver, I.; Robin, C.; Yardley, L.; Rubin, G.

In our study, we describe physical activity and sedentary behaviour patterns in relation to the pandemic and estimate associations between anxiety and physical activity and sedentary behaviour in community-dwelling adults. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Calgary, Alberta, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Between April and June 2020, a random sample of 1124 adults (≥18 years) completed an online questionnaire. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: The online questionnaire captured current walking, moderate intensity, vigorous intensity and total physical activity and sedentary behaviour (ie, sitting and leisure-based screen time), perceived relative changes in physical activity, sedentary and social behaviours since the pandemic, perceived seriousness and anxiety related to COVID-19, and sociodemographic characteristics. Differences in sociodemographic characteristics, perceived relative change in behaviour and current physical activity and sedentary behaviour were compared between adults with low and high anxiety. RESULTS: Our sample (n=1047) included more females (60.3%) and fewer older adults (19.2%). Most participants (88.4%) considered COVID-19 as extremely or very serious and one-third (32.9%) felt extremely or very anxious. We found no differences (p>0.05) in current physical activity or sedentary behaviour by anxiety level. The largest perceived change in behaviours included social distancing, driving motor vehicles, use of screen-based devices, watching television and interactions with neighbours. We found anxiety-related differences (p<0.05) in perceived changes in various behaviours.

This significantly accelerated the pace of development of countermeasures against Zaire ebolavirus that enabled vaccines to be a part of an effective response to the most recent 2018–2019 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, there remain urgent and unmet needs for medical countermeasures against other members of the Filoviridae family that cause viral hemorrhagic fevers. To improve the national and global preparedness posture for viral hemorrhagic fevers, a renewed emphasis is being placed on developing vaccines for filoviruses other than Zaire ebolavirus. Here we discuss lessons learned from the West Africa epidemic and how those lessons apply to the development of vaccine candidates for other filoviruses, specifically Sudan ebolavirus and Marburg virus.

652022,COVID-19,2020-12-31,"A critical question in the COVID-19 pandemic is how to optimally allocate the first available vaccinations to maximize health impact. We used a static simulation model with detailed demographic and risk factor stratification to compare the impact of different vaccine prioritization strategies in the United States on key health outcomes, using California as a case example. We calibrated the model to demographic and location data on 28,175 COVID-19 deaths in California up to December 30, 2020, and incorporated variation in risk by occupation and comorbidity status using published estimates. We predicted the proportion of COVID-19 clinical cases, deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted over 6 months relative to a scenario of no vaccination for five vaccination strategies that prioritized vaccination by a single risk factor: random allocation; targeting special populations (e.g. incarcerated individuals); targeting older individuals; targeting essential workers; and targeting individuals with comorbidities. Targeting older individuals averted the highest proportion of DALYs (40% for 5 million individuals vaccinated) and deaths (65%) but the lowest proportion of cases (12%). Targeting essential workers averted the lowest proportion of DALYs (25%) and deaths (33%). Allocating vaccinations simultaneously by age and location or by age, sex, race/ethnicity, location, occupation, and comorbidity status averted a significantly higher proportion of DALYs (48% and 56%) than any strategy prioritizing by a single risk factor. Our results corroborate findings of other studies that age targeting is the best single-risk-factor prioritization strategy for averting DALYs, and suggest that targeting by multiple risk factors would provide additional benefit.","Chapman, L.

To better understand the antiviral response to SARS-CoV-2, we used interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression screening to reveal that OAS1, through RNase L, potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2. We show that while some people can express a prenylated OAS1 variant, that is membrane-associated and blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection, other people express a cytosolic, nonprenylated OAS1 variant which does not detect SARS-CoV-2 (determined by the splice-acceptor SNP Rs10774671). Alleles encoding nonprenylated OAS1 predominate except in people of African descent. Importantly, in hospitalized patients, expression of prenylated OAS1 was associated with protection from severe COVID-19, suggesting this antiviral defense is a major component of a protective antiviral response. Remarkably, approximately 55 million years ago, retrotransposition ablated the OAS1 prenylation signal in horseshoe bats (the presumed source of SARS-CoV-2). Thus, SARS-CoV-2 never had to adapt to evade this defense. As prenylated OAS1 is widespread in animals, the billions of people that lack a prenylated OAS1 could make humans particularly vulnerable to the spillover of coronaviruses from horseshoe bats.","Wickenhagen, A.; Sugrue, E.; Lytras, S.; Kuchi, S.; Turnbull, M.

Nurse executives at a faith-based, not for profit healthcare system, quickly responded to ensure safe staffing, conservation of personal protective equipment (PPE) and implementation of infection prevention strategies. A significant challenge was safe staffing for the expected patient surge. To address this, a team of nurse executives utilized the ADKAR change model to guide a transition from primary to team nursing. The processes varied between hospitals, but core principles and implementation strategies were the same. This article will discuss the quick but methodical journey one health care system experienced.","Balluck, Julie; Asturi, Elizabeth; Brockman, Vicki",Nurse Lead,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1541461220302160?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32843885/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1541461220302160; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mnl.2020.08.006,571

We will begin by reviewing the basic concepts of HDL cholesterol synthesis and pathway regulation, followed by cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) pathophysiology. After explaining how the HDL and RCT pathways become dysfunctional through oxidative processes, we will elaborate on the potential role of HDL dysfunction in CRS. We will then present findings on how HDL function and the inducible antioxidant gene heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) are interconnected and how induction of HO-1 is protective against HDL dysfunction and important for the proper functioning of the cardiovascular–renal system. This will substantiate the proposal of HO-1 as a novel therapeutic target to prevent HDL dysfunction and, consequently, cardiovascular disease, renal dysfunction, and the onset of CRS.","Peterson, Stephen J.; Choudhary, Abu; Kalsi, Amardeep K.; Zhao, Shuyang; Alex, Ragin; Abraham, Nader G.",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33233550/; https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics10110976,571

As part of the efforts to keep the virus at bay, onsite instruction was suspended in 188 countries across the globe, jeopardizing the educational goals of over 91% of the world’s student population. Online learning emerged as an ultimate solution to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The main challenge of most developing countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, is to ensure effective online learning across all levels of education. The lack of funds, infrastructure, effective e-learning systems, ICT gadgets, and other challenges hindered the online learning in most developing countries from achieving its intended goal. With the realization that the COVID-19 may not die out soon and the prospect of a vaccine, Ghana, like many countries, resumed onsite instruction in early 2021. The study employed a phenomenological approach through personal interviews to explore the experiences of 20 tertiary students who were the first batch of students to be part of the temporal resumption of tertiary education in Ghana. From the analysis, it was observed that universities educated their staff and students on COVID-19. Nonetheless, there were contextual challenges with; the provision of personal protective equipment (PPEs), engagement in digital learning, parent–teacher collaboration, psychological health service, and course completion. The study discusses school preparedness plan of universities for resumption and draws from the literature to outline ten strategic ways to reopen schools.","Adarkwah, Michael Agyemang",SN Comput Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00664-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33977278/,571

La evidencia de validez en base a la relación con otras variables del CAS fue respaldada por la correlación positiva con la depresión (r = .52, p <.01) y negativa con el bienestar subjetivo (r = -.50, p <.01). Además, la depresión media la relación entre la ansiedad por el COVID-19 y el bienestar subjetivo (valor bootstrap = - .24, IC 95% = - .28, - .20). Conclusión: La versión en español del CAS posee evidencias de validez y confiabilidad para medir la ansiedad por el COVID-19 en una muestra de universitarios peruanos. Introduction and Objectives: COVID-19 has generated negative consequences for people's mental health. This is the case of Peru, one of the Latin American countries most affected by the pandemic. In this sense, the objective of the study was to translate and validate the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) into Spanish. Material and Method: The participants were 704 university students of health sciences (Mage = 23.39 years, SD = 3.45) who were administered the CAS in Spanish, the Mental Health Inventory-5 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 item. The CAS was translated into Spanish using the forward and backward method. Reliability and evidence of validity based on internal structure and relationship with other variables were examined. Results: The factor analysis confirmed the one-dimensional factor structure of the CAS (χ2 = 7.62, df = 5, p = .18, χ² / gl = 1.52, CFI = .99, RMSEA = .03 [90% CI .00, .06 ]; SRMR = .02, WRMR = .52); In addition, the factor loadings were large and significant (from .68 to .87). The five CAS items showed acceptable corrected total test item correlations (from .64 to .74). Reliability due to internal consistency was good (ω = 0.89; αordinal = 0.89). The validity evidence based on the relationship with other CAS variables was supported by the positive correlation with depression (r = .52, p <.01) and negative with subjective well-being (r = -.50, p <. 01). Furthermore, depression mediates the relationship between COVID-19 anxiety and subjective well-being (bootstrap value = - .24, 95% CI = - .28, - .20). Conclusion: The Spanish version of the CAS has evidence of validity and reliability to measure anxiety by COVID-19 in a sample of Peruvian university students.","Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Barboza-Palomino, Miguel; Ventura-León, José; Carbajal-León, Carlos; Noé-Grijlava, Martín; Gallegos, Miguel; Reyes-Bossio, Mario; Vivanco-Vidal, Andrea",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1134793720300348; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1134793720300348?v=s5,571

The coronavirus pandemic has challenged existing conservation structures and management but provides an opportunity to re‐examine strategies and research approaches across the tropics to build resilience for future crises. Based on the personal experiences of conservation leaders, managers, and researchers from Madagascar during this period, we discuss the coping strategies of multiple biodiversity conservation organizations during the coronavirus pandemic. We highlight the vital role of local communities in building and maintaining resilient conservation practices that are robust to global disruptions such as the COVID‐19 crisis. We argue that the integration of local experts and communities in conservation, research, and financial decision‐making is essential to a strong foundation for biodiversity conservation in developing countries to stand up to future environmental, political, and health crises. This integration could be achieved through the support of training and capacity building of local researchers and community members and these actions would also enhance the development of strong, equitable long‐term collaborations with international communities. Equipped with such capacity, conservationists and researchers from these regions could establish long‐term biodiversity conservation strategies that are adapted to local context, and communities could flexibly balance biodiversity and livelihood needs as circumstances change, including weathering the isolation and financial challenges of local or global crises.","Razanatsoa, Estelle; Andriantsaralaza, Seheno; Holmes, Sheila M.; Rakotonarivo, O.

655718,NMDA-receptor encephalitis associated with COVID-19 infection in a toddler,2020-10-09,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a cytosolic receptor which is involved in diverse cellular events in humans. The most well-characterized function of AHR is its ability to upregulate gene transcription after exposure to its ligands, such as environmental toxicants, dietary antioxidants, drugs, and endogenous ligands. The cellular content of AHR is partly controlled by its degradation via the ubiquitin–proteasome system and the lysosome-dependent autophagy. We used human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells to investigate how AHR undergoes protein degradation and how its activity is modulated. Since the glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β)-mediated phosphorylation can trigger protein degradation and substrates of GSK3β contain stretches of serine/threonine residues which can be found in AHR, we examined whether degradation and activity of AHR can be controlled by GSK3β. We observed that AHR undergoes the GSK3β-dependent, LC3-mediated lysosomal degradation without ligand treatment. The AHR can be phosphorylated in a GSK3β-dependent manner at three putative sites (S436/S440/S444, S689/S693/T697, and S723/S727/T731), which leads to lysosomal degradation of the AHR protein. Inhibition of the GSK3β activity suppresses the ligand-activated transcription of an AHR target gene in HeLa, human liver cancer (Hep3B), and human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells. Collectively, our findings support that phosphorylation of AHR by GSK3β is essential for the optimal activation of its target gene transcription and this phosphorylation may partake as an “off” switch by subjecting the receptor to lysosomal degradation.","Yang, Yujie; Chan, William K.",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34198826/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22116097,571

To date, eleven RNAs and five viral proteins of PCV2 have been detected. Here, we identified a novel viral gene within the PCV2 genome, termed ORF5, that exists at both the transcriptional and translational level during productive infection of PCV2 in porcine alveolar macrophages 3D4/2 (PAMs). Northern blot analysis was used to demonstrate that the ORF5 gene measures 180 bp in length and overlaps completely with ORF1 when read in the same direction. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to show that the ORF5 protein is not essential for PCV2 replication. To investigate the biological functions of the novel protein, we constructed a recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmid capable of expressing PCV2 ORF5. The results show that the GFP-tagged PCV2 ORF5 protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is degraded via the proteasome, inhibits PAM growth and prolongs the S-phase of the cell cycle. Further studies show that the GFP-tagged PCV2 ORF5 protein induces ER stress and activates NF-κB, which was further confirmed by a significant upregulation in IL-6, IL-8 and COX-2 expression. In addition, five cellular proteins (GPNMB, CYP1A1, YWHAB, ZNF511 and SRSF3) were found to interact with ORF5 via yeast two-hybrid assay. These findings provide novel information on the identification and functional analysis of the PCV2 ORF5 protein and are likely to be of benefit in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of PCV2 pathogenicity. However, additional experiments are needed to validate the expression and function of the ORF5 protein during PCV2 infection in vitro before any definitive conclusion can be drawn.","Lv, Qizhuang; Guo, Kangkang; Xu, Han; Wang, Tao; Zhang, Yanming",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26035722/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0127859,571
656633,Learning from each other: lessons from COVID-19,2021,"Viral envelope glycoproteins are oligomeric and the quaternary structure is critical for their membrane fusion activity. Typically the transmembrane glycoproteins of class I fusion proteins contain the oligomerization domains and the surface glycoproteins (SU) are monomeric. However, it has been previously demonstrated [J. Biol. Chem. 277 (2002) 19727] that the SU of a murine hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) forms dimers, the dimerization domain overlaps the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and that this dimeric state is important for binding to receptor molecules that initiates entry into cells. We have previously expressed various soluble fragments of the SARS-CoV SU and identified stably folded fragments (residues 272–537) that contain the RBD [Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 312 (2003) 1159]. Here, we further characterize these and other fragments in an attempt to identify possible dimerization domains and their role for membrane fusion. We demonstrate that the SU and a shorter 260-amino acid N-terminal fragment (residues 17–276), which folds independently, form dimers. In contrast to the previously characterized MHV SU dimerization, this fragment is upstream and distinct from the RBD. Its deletion abolished S-mediated cell membrane fusion but retained the SU-receptor-binding function indicating the possibility for a role in post-receptor binding steps of the virus entry mechanism. Interestingly, the whole soluble S ectodomain (Se) that contains the dimerization domain but not the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail forms trimers suggesting the existence of a trimerization domain in the TM subunit in its prefusion state that may lead to a conformation unfavorable for formation of higher-order multimeric structures. These results demonstrate the existence of SU dimers and Se trimers, and indicate the possibility for an unknown mechanism of their role in entry. They also further characterize the S-mediated membrane fusion and could be important for understanding the mechanisms of virus entry, and in the development of therapeutics and vaccines.","Xiao, Xiaodong; Feng, Yang; Chakraborti, Samitabh; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15313178/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X04015542; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X04015542,571

657726,A Year in the COVID-19 Epidemic: Cuba and Uruguay in the Latin American Context.,2021,"We studied the safety and reactogenicity SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in transplant recipients because immunosuppressed patients were excluded from vaccine trials. METHODS. US transplant recipients were recruited into this prospective cohort study through social media; those who completed the full vaccine series between December 9, 2020 and March 1, 2021 were included. We collected demographics, medical history, and safety information within 7 d after doses 1 and 2 (D1, D2). Associations between characteristics and reactions were evaluated using modified Poisson regression. RESULTS. We studied 741 transplant recipients who underwent BNT162b2 (54%) or mRNA-1273 (46%) vaccination. Median (interquartile range) age was 60 (44–69) y, 57% were female, and 10% were non-White. Although local site reactions decreased after D2 (85% D1 versus 78% D2, P < 0.001), systemic reactions increased (49% D1 versus 69% D2, P < 0.001). Younger participants were more likely to develop systemic symptoms after D1 (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] per 10 y = (0.85)0.90(0.94), P < 0.001) and D2 (aIRR per 10 y = (0.91)0.93(0.96), P < 0.001). Participants who experienced pain (aIRR = (1.11)1.66(2.47), P = 0.01) or redness (aIRR = (1.83)3.92(8.41), P < 0.01) were more likely to develop an antibody response to D1 of mRNA vaccines. No anaphylaxis, neurologic diagnoses, or SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses were reported. Infections were minimal (3% after D1, <0.01% after D2). One patient reported incident acute rejection post-D2. CONCLUSIONS. In solid organ transplant recipients undergoing mRNA vaccination, reactogenicity was similar to that reported in the original trials. Severe reactions were rare. These early safety data may help address vaccine hesitancy in transplant recipients.","Ou, Michael T.; Boyarsky, Brian J.; Motter, Jennifer D.; Greenberg, Ross S.; Teles, Aura T.; Ruddy, Jake A.; Krach, Michelle R.; Jain, Vedant S.; Werbel, William A.; Avery, Robin K.; Massie, Allan B.; Segev, Dorry L.; Garonzik-Wang, Jacqueline M.",Transplantation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33859151/; https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000003780,571
658550,The Need for Visible Nursing Leadership During COVID‐19,2020-07-07,"We used big data analytics for exploring the relationship between government response policies, human mobility trends and numbers of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases comparatively in Poland, Turkey and South Korea. We collected daily mobility data of retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential areas. For quantifying the actions taken by governments and making a fairness comparison between these countries, we used stringency index values measured with the ‘Oxford COVID-19 government response tracker’. For the Turkey case, we also developed a model by implementing the multilayer perceptron algorithm for predicting numbers of cases based on the mobility data. We finally created scenarios based on the descriptive statistics of the mobility data of these countries and generated predictions on the numbers of cases by using the developed model. Based on the descriptive analysis, we pointed out that while Poland and Turkey had relatively closer values and distributions on the study variables, South Korea had more stable data compared to Poland and Turkey. We mainly showed that while the stringency index of the current day was associated with mobility data of the same day, the current day’s mobility was associated with the numbers of cases 1 month later. By obtaining 89.3% prediction accuracy, we also concluded that the use of mobility data and implementation of big data analytics technique may enable decision-making in managing uncertain environments created by outbreak situations. We finally proposed implications for policymakers for deciding on the targeted levels of mobility to maintain numbers of cases in a manageable range based on the results of created scenarios.","Sözen, Mert Erkan; Sarıyer, Görkem; Ataman, Mustafa Gökalp",Health Policy Plan,https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czab096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34365501/,571

Virtual management (telemedicine) has been shown to reduce health costs and improve access to care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this survey is to understand oncologists’ awareness of and views on virtual management, challenges, and preferences, as well as their priorities regarding the prescribing of anticancer treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We created a self-administrated electronic survey about the virtual management of patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated its clinical sensibility and pilot tested the instrument. We surveyed practicing oncologists in Gulf and Arab countries using snowball sampling via emails and social media networks. Reminders were sent 1 and 2 weeks later using SurveyMonkey. RESULTS: We received 222 responses from validated oncologists from April 2-22, 2020. An awareness of virtual clinics, virtual multidisciplinary teams, and virtual prescriptions was reported by 182 (82%), 175 (79%), and 166 (75%) respondents, respectively. Reported challenges associated with virtual management were the lack of physical exam (n=134, 60%), patients’ awareness and access (n=131, 59%), the lack of physical attendance of patients (n=93, 42%), information technology (IT) support (n=82, 37%), and the safety of virtual management (n=78, 35%). Overall, 111 (50%) and 107 (48%) oncologists did not prefer the virtual prescription of chemotherapy and novel immunotherapy, respectively. However, 188 (85%), 165 (74%), and 127 (57%) oncologists preferred the virtual prescription of hormonal therapy, bone modifying agents, and targeted therapy, respectively. In total, 184 (83%), 183 (83%), and 176 (80%) oncologists preferred to continue neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and perioperative treatments, respectively. Overall, 118 (53%) respondents preferred to continue first-line palliative treatment, in contrast to 68 (30%) and 47 (21%) respondents indicating a preference to interrupt second- and third-line palliative treatment, respectively. For administration of virtual prescriptions, all respondents preferred the oral route and 118 (53%) preferred the subcutaneous route. In contrast, 193 (87%) did not prefer the intravenous route for virtual prescriptions. Overall, 102 (46%) oncologists responded that they would “definitely” prefer to manage patients with cancer virtually. CONCLUSIONS: Oncologists have a high level of awareness of virtual management. Although their survey responses indicated that second- and third-line palliative treatments should be interrupted, they stated that neoadjuvant, adjuvant, perioperative, and first-line palliative treatments should continue. Our results confirm that oncologists’ views on the priority of anticancer treatments are consistent with the evolving literature during the COVID-19 pandemic. Challenges to virtual management should be addressed to improve the care of patients with cancer.","Tashkandi, Emad; Zeeneldin, Ahmed; AlAbdulwahab, Amal; Elemam, Omima; Elsamany, Shereef; Jastaniah, Wasil; Abdullah, Shaker; Alfayez, Mohammad; Jazieh, Abdul Rahman; Al-Shamsi, Humaid O",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32501807/; https://doi.org/10.2196/19691,571

The current COVID-19 outbreak caused a pandemic with millions of infected patients and death cases worldwide. The clinical features of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was initially linked with respiratory disorders, but recent studies have reported alterations of neurological and cerebrovascular functions in COVID-19 patients. The main viral infection features are related to cell death, inflammation, and cytokine generation, which can be associated with the dysregulation of redox systems or oxidative stress. However, until now, there is no available and effective therapeutic approach. Thus, it is necessary to search for care and adequate protection against the disease, especially for susceptible and vulnerable groups. Preconditioning, a well-known antioxidative stress and anti-inflammatory approach, is protective against many neurological age-related disorders. COVID-19 severity and morbidity have been observed in elderly patients. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the possible protective role of oxidative preconditioning in aged patients at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 complications.","Akki, Rachid; Fath, Nada; Mohti, Hicham",ACS Chem Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33147964/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00453,571

A few weeks after the beginning of his complaints, he contracted a mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Upon examination, his aches were defined as carotidynia; thus, proper radiologic evaluation was carried out. While ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans showed evident signs of left common carotid (LCC) vasculitis, computed tomography angiography (CTA) and positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) scans revealed no vascular findings. Unexpected hypermetabolic hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy was found on PET-CT, necessitating lymph node biopsy. Pathology results displayed noncaseating granulomas. Besides, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels in blood were high. Sarcoidosis, with concurrent LCC vasculitis, was diagnosed, and corticosteroid therapy was started.

659462,"Functionality of Nanomaterials and its Technological Aspects - Used in Preventing, Diagnosing and Treating COVID-19",2021-05-04,"Abstract Cryptosporidium is an obligate intracellular parasite which can cause fatal diarrheal disease in exotic animals. Sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps), hedgehogs (Atelerix albiventris), chinchillas (Chinchilla lanigera), and common leopard geckos (Eublepharis macularius) are popular exotic animals commonly sold in pet shops in Japan. We herein investigated the species and subtypes of Cryptosporidium in these animals. Cryptosporidium fayeri was detected in a sugar glider in a Japanese animal hospital. Sequence analyses of the 60-kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene revealed that C. fayeri belonged to subtype family IVh (IVhA13G2T1), which was proposed to be a new subtype. This is the first study to report C. fayeri infection in a sugar glider. In other animals, the Cryptosporidium horse genotype, C. ubiquitum, and C. varanii were detected in two four-toed hedgehogs (A. albiventris), a chinchilla (C. lanigera), and common leopard gecko (E. macularius), respectively. The gp60 subtypes identified were VIbA13 of the horse genotype and XIId of C. ubiquitum. The present results revealed that potentially zoonotic Cryptosporidium is widespread in exotic animals in Japan.","Takaki, Youki; Takami, Yoshinori; Watanabe, Takehiro; Nakaya, Takaaki; Murakoshi, Fumi",Vet Parasitol Reg Stud Reports,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405939020302112; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405939020302112?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32862916/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vprsr.2020.100430,571
659764,Analysis of internet trends related to medications for COVID-19in ten countries with the highest number of cases,2020-09-09,"We introduce the problem of determining the mutational support of genes in the SARS-Cov-2 virus and estimating the distribution of mutations within different genes using small sample sizes that do not allow for accurate maximum likelihood estimation. The mutational support refers to the unknown number of sites mutated across all strains and individual samples of the SARS-Cov-2 genome; given the high cost and limited availability of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test kits, especially in early stages of infections when only a small number of genomic samples (∼ 1000s) are available that do not allow for determining the exact degree of mutations in an RNA virus that comprises roughly 30, 000 nucleotides. Nevertheless, working with small sample sets is required in order to quickly predict the mutation rate of this and other viruses and get an insight into their transformational power. Furthermore, with the small number of samples available, it is hard to estimate the mutational landscape across different age/gender groups and geographical locations which may be of great importance in assessing different risk categories and factors influencing susceptibility to infection. To this end, we use our state-of-the art polynomial estimator techniques and the Good-Turing estimator to obtain estimates based on only roughly 1, 000 samples per category. Our analysis reveals an interesting finding: the mutational support appears to be statistically more significant in patients which appear to have lower infection rates and handle the exposure with milder symptoms, such as women and people of relatively young age (≤ 55).","Rana, Vishal; Chien, Eli; Peng, Jianhao; Milenkovic, Olgica",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.23.20076075v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.23.20076075,571
660262,Rethinking community participation in education post Covid-19,2021-01-15,"The Covid-19 pandemic required rapid scale of telemedicine as well as other digital workflows to maintain access to care while reducing infection risk. Both patients and clinicians who hadn't used telemedicine before were suddenly faced with a multi-step setup process to log into a virtual meeting. Unlike in-person examination rooms, locking a virtual meeting room was more error-prone and posed a risk of multiple patients joining the same online session. There was administrative burden on the practice staff who were generating and manually sending links to patients, and educating patients on device set up was time-consuming and unsustainable. A solution had to be deployed rapidly system-wide, without the usual roll out across months. Our answer was to design and implement a novel EHR-integrated web application called the Switchboard, in just two weeks. The Switchboard leverages a commercial, cloud-based video meeting platform and facilitates an end-to-end virtual care encounter workflow, from pre-visit reminders to post-visit SMS text message-based measurement of patient experience, with tools to extend contact-less workflows to in-person appointments. Over the first 11 months of the pandemic, the in-house platform has been adopted across 6 hospitals and >200 practices, scaled to 8,800 clinicians who at their peak conducted an average of 30,000 telemedicine appointments/week, and enabled over 10,000-20,000 text messages/day to be exchanged through the platform.

In vitro, sarcoid derived fibroblasts are invasive and express matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -1, -2 and -9. It was hypothesised that the MMPs produced by neoplastic cells play a role in both their local invasiveness and interaction with the overlying epidermis (picket fence formation). The objective of this morphological study was to investigate the local behaviour and in situ MMP expression pattern in sarcoids of different clinical types. A total of 43 surgically excised sarcoids were examined by histology, immunohistology for the expression of MMP-1, -2 and -9, and transmission electron microscopy. Regardless of the clinical type, sarcoids showed local invasion of the dermis and damage to the basement membrane in areas of interaction with the epidermis. This was associated with MMP-1 expression in both neoplastic cells and epidermis. The results suggest a link between MMP-1 expression and the local aggressiveness of sarcoids regardless of the clinical type.","Mosseri, S.; Hetzel, U.; Hahn, Shelley; Michaloupoulou, Eleni; Sallabank, Hannah Clare; Knottenbelt, Derek C.; Kipar, A.",Vet J,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023314003189; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023314003189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25439440/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2014.07.026,571

Les traumatismes psychologiques peuvent bien sûr, expliquer une partie de ces troubles. Cependant, dans la mesure où les troubles psychiatriques sont également associés à une composante immuno-inflammatoire, les effets directs du virus sur le système immunitaire de l’hôte, avec une réponse inflammatoire marquée, mais également l’inflammation secondaire à ces facteurs de stress psychosociaux, peuvent entraîner l’apparition ou l’aggravation de pathologies psychiatriques. Cet article vise donc à identifier les possibles conséquences immuno-psychiatriques de la pandémie de SARS-CoV-2 qui pourraient être utiles en termes de dépistage et/ou de prise en charge. Méthode: Nous nous sommes appuyés sur les données issues des précédentes pandémies et les données existantes à ce jour sur les conséquences psychopathologiques de la pandémie de SARS-CoV-2, pour réaliser une revue de la littérature narrative sur les possibles conséquences immuno-psychiatriques de la pandémie de SARS-CoV-2. Nous avons ciblé l’environnement gestationnel en raison des risques de troubles neuro-développementaux pour le fœtus, d’une part, et les enfants et adultes directement infectés avec les risques de développer des troubles psychiatriques, d’autre part. Résultats: Comme durant les précédentes pandémies, l’activation du système immunitaire due au stress et/ou à l’infection pendant la grossesse pourrait conduire à un risque accru de troubles du neuro-développement chez le fœtus (schizophrénie et troubles du spectre de l’autisme). De plus, chez les individus exposés à des traumatismes psychologiques et/ou infectés par le virus, le risque de troubles psychiatriques, notamment de troubles de l’humeur, est probable. Conclusion: Dans ce contexte, des mesures de dépistage et de prise en charge dédiées sont indispensables. Il est de fait important de proposer aux individus ayant été infectés par le virus, un suivi rapproché afin de mettre en place une prise en charge la plus précoce possible. De même chez les femmes enceintes, le dépistage de troubles de l’humeur pendant la grossesse ou en post-partum doit être facilité. Le suivi des bébés nés pendant la période pandémique doit être renforcé afin de dépister et de prendre en charge d’éventuels troubles du neuro-développement. Abstract Objective: The SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19) pandemic has been propagating since December 2019, along a drastic increase in the prevalence of anxious and depressive disorders in the general population. Psychological trauma can partly explain these troubles. However, since psychiatric disorders also have an immuno-inflammatory component, the direct effects of the virus on the host’s immune system, with a marked inflammatory response, but also the secondary inflammation to these psychosocial stressors, may cause the apparition or the worsening of psychiatric pathologies. So, this article aims to identify the probable immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to think about possible actions of screening and care that could ensue. Method : Drawing on data from previous pandemics, and existing data on the psychopathological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the authors performed a narrative review on the possible immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, on the gestational environment, with the risk of consecutive neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus on the one hand, on the children and adults directly infected, and the subsequent risks of psychiatric disorders on the other hand. Results: As in previous pandemics, the activation of the immune system due to psychological stress and/or the infection during pregnancy, might lead to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus (schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders). Furthermore, in individuals exposed to psychological trauma and/or infected by the virus, the risk of psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, is probably increased. Conclusion: In this context, preventive measures and specialized care are necessary. Thus, it is important to propose a close follow-up to the individuals who have been infected by the virus, in order to set up the earliest care possible. Likewise, in pregnant women, screening of mood disorders during the pregnancy or the postpartum period must be facilitated. The follow-up of the babies born during the pandemic must be strengthened to screen and care for possible neurodevelopmental disorders.","Daaboul, Jacques; Tamouza, Ryad; Leboyer, Marion",Encephale,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013700620301871?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32928535/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013700620301871; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.07.002,571
661318,Revisited COVID-19 Mortality and Recovery Rates: Are we Missing Recovery Time Period?,2020-10-25,"Following the worldwide emergence of the p.Asp614Gly shift in the Spike (S) gene of SARS-CoV-2, there have been few recurring pathogenic shifts occurring during 2020, as assessed by genomic sequencing. This situation has evolved in the last several months with the emergence of several distinct variants (first identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa) that manifest multiple changes in the S gene, particularly p.Asn501Tyr (N501Y), that likely have clinical impact. We report here the emergence in Columbus, Ohio in December 2020 of two novel SARS-CoV-2 clade 20G variants. One variant, that has become the predominant virus found in nasopharyngeal swabs in the December 2020-January 2021 period, harbors S p.Gln677His (Q677H), affecting a consensus QTQTN domain near the S1/S2 furin cleavage site, nucleocapsid (N) p.Asp377Tyr (D377Y) and membrane glycoprotein (M) p.Ala85Ser (A85S) mutations, with additional S mutations in subsets. The other variant present in two samples, contains S N501Y, which is a marker of the UK-B.1.1.7 (clade 20I/501Y.V1) strain, but lacks all other mutations from that virus. The Ohio variant is from a different clade and shares multiple mutations with the clade 20G viruses circulating in the area prior to December 2020. These two SARS-CoV-2 viruses, which we show are also present and evolving currently in several other parts of North America, add to the diversity of S gene shifts occurring worldwide. These and other shifts in this period of the pandemic support multiple independent acquisition of functionally significant and potentially complementing mutations affecting the S QTQTN site (Q675H or Q677H) and certain receptor binding domain mutations (e.g., E484K and N501Y).","Tu, Huolin; Avenarius, Matthew R; Kubatko, Laura; Hunt, Matthew; Pan, Xiaokang; Ru, Peng; Garee, Jason; Thomas, Keelie; Mohler, Peter; Pancholi, Preeti; Jones, Dan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.12.426407,571
664498,Covid-19 laboratory leak hypothesis: extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence,2021,"BACKGROUND: South Africa is experiencing colliding epidemics of HIV/AIDS and noncommunicable diseases. In response, the National Department of Health has implemented integrated chronic disease management aimed at strengthening primary health care (PHC) facilities to manage chronic illnesses. However, chronic care is still fragmented. This study explored how the health system functions to care for patients with comorbid type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and HIV/AIDS at a tertiary hospital in Soweto, South Africa. METHODS: We employed ethnographic methods encompassing clinical observations and qualitative interviews with health care providers at the hospital (n=30). Data were transcribed verbatim and thematically analyzed using QSR NVivo 12 software. FINDINGS: Health systemic challenges such as the lack of medication, untrained nurses, and a limited number of doctors at PHC clinics necessitated patient referrals to a tertiary hospital. At the hospital, patients with T2DM were managed first at the medical outpatient clinic before they were referred to a specialty clinic. Those with comorbidities attended different clinics at the hospital partly due to the structure of the tertiary hospital that offers specialized care. In addition, little to no collaboration occurred among health care providers due to poor communication, noncentralized patient information, and staff shortage. As a result, patients experienced disjointed care. CONCLUSION: PHC clinics in Soweto need to be strengthened by training nurses to diagnose and manage patients with T2DM and also by ensuring adequate medical supplies. We recommend that the medical outpatient clinic at a tertiary hospital should also be strengthened to offer integrated and collaborative care to patients with T2DM and other comorbidities. Addressing key systemic challenges such as staff shortages and noncentralized patient information will create a patient-centered as opposed to disease-specific approach to care.","Bosire, Edna N.; Norris, Shane A.; Goudge, Jane; Mendenhall, Emily",Glob Health Sci Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33591926/; https://doi.org/10.9745/ghsp-d-20-00104,571

To evaluate the frequency of RV, nasal washes were collected year-round from BMT recipients with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection (URI). Direct immunofluorescence assay was performed for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza (Flu) A and B, adenovirus and parainfluenza (Paraflu) virus. Patients with RSV pneumonia or with upper RSV infection, but considered at high risk for developing RSV pneumonia received aerosolized ribavirin. Oseltamivir was given to patients with influenza. A total of 179 patients had 392 episodes of URI. In all, 68 (38%) tested positive: RSV was detected in 18 patients (26.4%), Flu B in 17 (25%), Flu A in 11 (16.2%) and Paraflu in 7 (10.3%). A total of 14 patients (20.6%) had multiple RV infections or coinfection. RSV pneumonia developed in 55.5% of the patients with RSV-URI. One of the 15 patients (6.6%) with RSV pneumonia died. Influenza pneumonia was diagnosed in three patients (7.3%). RSV and influenza infections peaked in fall–winter and winter–spring months, respectively. We observed decreased rates of influenza and parainfluenza pneumonia and low mortality because of RSV pneumonia. The role of antiviral interventions such as aerosolized ribavirin and new neuraminidase inhibitors remains to be defined in randomized trials.","Machado, C M; Boas, L S Vilas; Mendes, A V A; Santos, M F M; da Rocha, I F; Sturaro, D; Dulley, F L; Pannuti, C S",Bone Marrow Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12692610/,571
665448,Spread of COVID-19 in urban neighbourhoods and slums of the developing world,2021-01-20,"BACKGROUND: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the attitudes and behaviors of physicians performing bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Between March 2020 and May 2020, a total of 153 physicians were included in the study. An invitation letter for the participation in the study with a structured questionnaire of 18 questions were sent to the mail groups twice with five-day intervals. Participation in the study was allowed, until the third day after the second mail was sent. RESULTS: All participants completed the questionnaire. According to the results, 33% of the physicians did not perform bronchoscopy and the majority of the physicians performed very few procedures during the outbreak, although the participants mostly worked at the tertiary hospitals (mean: 7.2±9.3). A total of 20% of the physicians performed bronchoscopy in potential or proven COVID-19 patients. Almost all of the physicians who participated in the survey reported the use of personal protective equipment such as masks and goggles during the procedure. During the pandemic, 9.7% of the physicians who performed bronchoscopy to potential or proven COVID-19 patients and 4.1% of the participants who did not perform bronchoscopy to any potential or proven COVID-19 patients were found to be infected with the virus (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Physicians who perform bronchoscopy during pandemic act in accordance with the recommendations of guidelines. Although there was no statistically significant difference between the SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates of the teams who performed and did not perform bronchoscopy in potential or proven COVID-19 patients in our study, the high rate of personal protective equipment utilization might have played a role in this result.","Çağlayan, Benan; Karataş, Ferhan; İliaz, Sinem; Uzel, Işıl; Öztürk, Ayşe Bilge; Demir, Tuane",Turk Gogus Kalp Damar Cerrahisi Derg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34104512/; https://doi.org/10.5606/tgkdc.dergisi.2021.20351,571

We describe the overall PA behaviour and support preferences of AYAs and explore subgroup differences to inform AYA-specific research and support. METHODS: AYAs diagnosed with cancer between the ages of 18–39 years, irrespective of current age, were approached in clinic at a large cancer centre for this cross-sectional survey that assessed self-reported demographics, medical history, PA behaviour and PA support preferences. RESULTS: A total of 318 AYAs completed the survey. Approximately 40% of AYAs were not meeting PA guidelines, and only 5% reported engagement with cancer PA support services. Most AYAs wanted PA support (78%), to increase PA levels (70%), and were interested in engaging in PA interventions that were individually supervised (82%), home-based (79%), performed ≥ 3 days/week (75%) and for ≥ 30 minutes/session (78%), offered following treatment (63%), restricted by age (63%), and involved strength (83%), walking (78%), and flexibility (75%) exercise. PA preferences most often differed according to sex, treatment status, current PA behaviour and PA support setting. CONCLUSION: AYAs have a great capacity and interest in specific types of PA support. Poor engagement with existing PA support services highlights the need for further AYA-specific research. Better understanding of AYAs' unique PA behaviour and support preferences can inform the development of urgently needed research and support services for this understudied and rapidly growing population.

666365,Positive outcomes of COVID-19 research-related gender policy changes,2020-10-26,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies established an association between laboratory-confirmed influenza infection (LCI) and hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) but not causality. We aimed to explore the underlying mechanisms by adding biological mediators to an established study design used by earlier studies. METHODS: With data on biomarkers, we used a self-controlled case-series design to evaluate the effect of LCI on hospitalization for AMI among Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients. We included senior Veterans (age 65 years and older) with LCI between 2010 through 2015. Patient-level data from VHA electronic medical records were used to capture laboratory results, hospitalizations, and baseline patient characteristics. We defined the “risk interval” as the first 7 days after specimen collection and the “control interval” as 1 year before and 1 year after the risk interval. More importantly, using mediation analysis, we examined the role of abnormal white blood cell (WBC) and platelet count in the relationship between LCI and AMI to explore the thrombogenic nature of this association, thus potential causality. RESULTS: We identified 391 hospitalizations for AMI that occurred within +/-1 year of a positive influenza test, of which 31 (31.1 admissions/week) occurred during the risk interval and 360 (3.5/per week) during the control interval, resulting in an incidence ratio (IR) for AMI admission of 8.89 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.16–12.84). In stratified analyses, AMI risk was significantly elevated among patients with high WBC count (IR, 12.43; 95% CI: 6.99–22.10) and high platelet count (IR, 15.89; 95% CI: 3.59–70.41). CONCLUSION: We confirmed a significant association between LCI and AMI. The risk was elevated among those with high WBC or platelet count, suggesting a potential role for inflammation and platelet activation in the underlying mechanism.","Young-Xu, Yinong; Smith, Jeremy; Mahmud, Salaheddin M.; Van Aalst, Robertus; Thommes, Edward W.; Neupane, Nabin; Lee, Jason K.

Over 85% of “premature” deaths worldwide due to NCDs occur in the LMICs. NCDs are an economic burden on these countries, increasing their healthcare expenditure. However, targeting NCDs in LMICs is challenging due to evolving health systems and an emphasis on acute illness.

667401,Education to Action: Improving Public Perception of Bats,2016-01-15,"BACKGROUND: The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) represents a current threat to the Arabian Peninsula, and potential pandemic disease. As of June 3, 2014, MERS CoV has reportedly infected 688 people and killed 282. We briefly summarize the state of the outbreak, and highlight unanswered questions and various explanations for the observed epidemiology. FINDINGS: The continuing but infrequent cases of MERS-CoV reported over the past two years have been puzzling and difficult to explain. The epidemiology of MERS-CoV, with many sporadic cases and a few hospital outbreaks, yet no sustained epidemic, suggests a low reproductive number. Furthermore, a clear source of infection to humans remains unknown. Also puzzling is the fact that MERS-CoV has been present in Saudi Arabia over several mass gatherings, including the 2012 and 2013 Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages, which predispose to epidemics, without an epidemic arising. CONCLUSIONS: The observed epidemiology of MERS-CoV is quite distinct and does not clearly fit either a sporadic or epidemic pattern. Possible explanations of the unusual features of the epidemiology of MERS-CoV include sporadic ongoing infections from a non-human source; human to human transmission with a large proportion of undetected cases; or a combination of both. The virus has been identified in camels; however the mode of transmission of the virus to humans remains unknown, and many cases have no history of animal contact. In order to gain a better understanding of the epidemiology of MERS CoV, further investigation is warranted.","Gardner, Lauren M; MacIntyre, C Raina",BMC Res Notes,https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-7-358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24920393/,571

667930,Research in counselling and psychotherapy Post‐COVID‐19,2020-07-03,"L-SIGN is a C-type lectin expressed on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells involved in the capture of hepatitis C virus and trans-infection of adjacent hepatocyte cells. The neck region of L-SIGN is highly polymorphic, with three to nine tandem repeats of 23 residues. This polymorphism is associated with a number of infectious diseases, but has not been explored in HCV. We therefore investigated the impact of L-SIGN neck region length variation on the outcome of HCV infection. We studied 322 subjects, 150 patients with persistent HCV infection, 63 individuals with spontaneous clearance and 109 healthy controls. In healthy subjects, we found a total of nine genotypes, with the 7/7 genotype being the most frequent (33%) followed by the 7/6 (22.9%) and the 7/5 (18.3%). The frequencies of the alleles were as follows: 7-LSIGN (56.4%), 6-LSIGN (20.2%), 5-L-SIGN (18.3%) and 4-L-SIGN (5%). The frequency of the 7/4 genotype was higher in spontaneous resolvers (14.3%) as compared with the persistent group (4%) (OR = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.07–0.82, p 0.022). In addition, we found that 4-L-SIGN was associated with spontaneous resolution of HCV infection (OR = 0.30, 95%CI, 0.12–0.74, p 0.005). Interestingly, patients with 4-L-SIGN had lower viral loads when compared with carriers of the 5 (p 0.001), 6 (p 0.021) and 7-alleles (p 0.048). The results indicate that neck region polymorphism of L-SIGN can influence the outcome of HCV infection and the four-tandem repeat is associated with clearance of HCV infection.","Ezzikouri, S.; Rebbani, K.; Fakhir, F.-Z.; Alaoui, R.; Nadir, S.; Diepolder, H.; Thursz, M.; Khakoo, S.I.; Benjelloun, S.",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://doi.org/10.1111/1469-0691.12403; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24283933/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14600963; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X14600963,571
667988,Attaching clinical significance to COVID-19-associated diarrhea,2020-11-01,"BACKGROUND: The classification of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) issued by the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium (EORTC/MSGERC) is used for immunocompromised patients. An alternative algorithm adapted to the intensive care unit (ICU) population has been proposed (AspICU), but this algorithm did not include microbial biomarkers such as the galactomannan antigen and the Aspergillus quantitative PCR. The objective of the present pilot study was to evaluate a new algorithm that includes fungal biomarkers (BM-AspICU) for the diagnosis of probable IPA in an ICU population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 35 patients with pathology-proven IPA according to European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycosis Study Group (EORTC/MSGERC)-2008 criteria were extracted from the French multicenter database of the Invasive Fungal Infections Surveillance Network (RESSIF). The patients were investigated according to the AspICU algorithm, and the BM-AspICU algorithm in analyzing the clinical, imaging, and biomarker data available in the records, without taking into account the pathology findings. RESULTS: Eight patients had to be excluded because no imaging data were recorded in the database. Among the 27 proven IPAs with complete data, 16 would have been considered as putative IPA with the AspICU algorithm and 24 would have been considered as probable IPA using the new algorithm BM-AspICU. Seven out of the 8 patients with probable BM-AspICU IPA (and not classified with the AspICU algorithm) had no host factors and no Aspergillus-positive broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) culture. Three patients were non-classifiable with any of the two algorithms, because they did not have any microbial criteria during the course of the infection, and diagnosis of proven aspergillosis was done using autopsy samples. CONCLUSION: Inclusion of biomarkers could be effective to identify probable IPA in the ICU population. A prospective study is needed to validate the routine application of the BM-AspICU algorithm in the ICU population.","Hamam, Joffrey; Navellou, Jean-Christophe; Bellanger, Anne-Pauline; Bretagne, Stéphane; Winiszewski, Hadrien; Scherer, Emeline; Piton, Gael; Millon, Laurence",Ann Intensive Care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13613-021-00827-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33683480/,571

Objective: To examine prevalence of comorbidities, rates of hospitalization and survival, and incidence of CV manifestations of COVID-19 in a predominantly AA population in south metropolitan Chicago. Design, Setting, Participants: This was an observational cohort study of COVID-19 patients encountered from March 16 to April 16, 2020 at the University of Chicago. Deidentified data were obtained from an institutional data warehouse. Group comparisons and logistic regression modeling based on baseline demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and diagnostic testing was performed. Exposures: COVID-19 was diagnosed by nasopharyngeal swab testing and clinical management was at the discretion of treating physicians. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were hospitalization and in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes included incident CV manifestations of COVID-19 in the context of overall cardiology service utilization. Results: During the 30 day study period, 1008 patients tested positive for COVID-19 and 689 had available encounter data. Of these, 596 (87%) were AA and 356 (52%) were hospitalized, of which 319 (90%) were AA. Age > 60 years, tobacco use, BMI >40 kg/m2, diabetes mellitus (DM), insulin use, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease (CAD), and atrial fibrillation (AF) were more common in hospitalized patients. Age > 60 years, tobacco use, CAD, and AF were associated with greater risk of in-hospital mortality along with several elevated initial laboratory markers including troponin, NT-proBNP, blood urea nitrogen, and ferritin. Despite this, cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 were uncommon, coincident with a 69% decrease in cardiology service utilization. For hospitalized patients, median length of stay was 6.2 days (3.4-11.9 days) and mortality was 13%. AA patients were more commonly hospitalized, but without increased mortality. Conclusions and Relevance: In this AA-predominant experience from south metropolitan Chicago, CV comorbidities and chronic diseases were highly prevalent and associated with increased hospitalization and mortality. Insulin-requiring DM and CKD emerged as novel predictors for hospitalization. Despite the highest rate of comorbidities reported to date, CV manifestations of COVID-19 and mortality were relatively low. The unexpectedly low rate of mortality merits further study.","Nguyen, A.

With this pandemic, to combat the spreading of COVID-19, effective testing methodologies and immediate medical treatments are much required. Chest X-rays are the widely available modalities for immediate diagnosis of COVID-19. Hence, automation of detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using machine learning approaches is of greater demand. A model for detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray images is proposed in this paper. A novel concept of cluster-based one-shot learning is introduced in this work. The introduced concept has an advantage of learning from a few samples against learning from many samples in case of deep leaning architectures. The proposed model is a multi-class classification model as it classifies images of four classes, viz., pneumonia bacterial, pneumonia virus, normal, and COVID-19. The proposed model is based on ensemble of Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) classifiers at decision level. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been demonstrated through extensive experimentation on a publicly available dataset consisting of 306 images. The proposed cluster-based one-shot learning has been found to be more effective on GRNN and PNN ensembled model to distinguish COVID-19 images from that of the other three classes. It has also been experimentally observed that the model has a superior performance over contemporary deep learning architectures. The concept of one-shot cluster-based learning is being first of its kind in literature, expected to open up several new dimensions in the field of machine learning which require further researching for various applications.","Aradhya, V.

669473,COVID-19 and the Urology Match: Perspectives and a Call to Action,2020-03-31,"While economic inequalities have been a key focus of attention through the COVID 19 pandemic, gendered relations of power at every level have undermined health rights of women, girls and gender diverse individuals. Sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR) have always been sites of power contestations within families, societies, cultures, and politics; these struggles are exacerbated by economic, racial, religious, caste, citizenship status, and other social inequities, especially in times of crisis such as these. Policy responses to the COVID pandemic such as lockdown, quarantine, contact tracing and similar measures are premised on the existence of a social contract between the government and the people and among people, with the health sector playing a key role in preventive and curative care. We propose the use of an intersectional lens to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social contract, drawing on our field experiences from different continents particularly as related to SRHR. Along with documenting the ways in which the pandemic hinders access to services, we note that it is essential to interrogate state-society relations in the context of vulnerable and marginalized groups, in order to understand implications for SRHR. Intersectional analysis takes on greater importance now than in non-pandemic times as the state exercises more police or other powers and deploys myriad ways of ‘othering’. We conclude that an intersectional analysis should not limit itself to the cumulative disadvantages and injustices posed by the pandemic for specific social groups, but also examine the historical inequalities, structural drivers, and damaged social contract that underlie state-society relationships. At the same time, the pandemic has questioned the status quo and in doing so it has provided opportunities for disruption; for re-imagining a social contract that reaches across sectors, and builds community resilience and solidarities while upholding human rights and gender justice. This must find place in future organizing and advocacy around SRHR.","Dasgupta, Jashodhara; Schaaf, Marta; Contractor, Sana Qais; Banda, Amanda; Viana, Marisa; Kashyntseva, Oksana; Ruano, Ana Lorena",Int J Equity Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32736634/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-020-01245-w,571

With increasing usage, there has been growing concern about the prolongation of QTc interval and Torsades de Pointes (TdP) with HCQ, especially in combination with azithromycin. AIMS: This meta-analysis is planned to study the risk of QTc prolongation and Torsades de pointes (TdP) by a well-defined criterion for HCQ, CQ alone, and in combination with Azithromycin in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was made in two databases (PubMed, Embase). Three outcomes explored in the included studies were frequency of QTc > 500 ms (ms) or ΔQTc > 60 ms (Outcome 1), frequency of QTc > 500 ms (Outcome 2) and frequency of TdP (Outcome 3). Random effects method with inverse variance approach was used for computation of pooled summary and risk ratio. RESULTS: A total of 13 studies comprising of 2138 patients were included in the final analysis. The pooled prevalence of outcome 1, outcome 2 and outcome 3 for HCQ, CQ alone with or without Azithromycin were 10.18% (5.59–17.82%, I(2) – 92%), 10.22% (6.01–16.85%, I(2) – 79%), and 0.72% (0.34–1.51, I(2) – 0%) respectively. The prevalence of outcome 2 in subgroup analysis for HCQ and HCQ + Azithromycin was 7.25% (3.22–15.52, I(2) – 59%) and 8.61% (4.52–15.79, I(2) – 76%), respectively. The risk ratio (RR) for outcome 1 and outcome 2 between HCQ + Azithromycin and HCQ was 1.22 (0.77–1.93, I(2) – 0%) & 1.51 (0.79–2.87, I(2) – 13%), respectively and was not significant.

Children will be allocated to one of two groups with at least 44 children in each group. Groups will be matched for age, sex and motor impairment. The intervention arm will receive a comprehensive, multidimensional programme over a period of 11 months comprising (1) caregiver-led training workshops, (2) therapist-led practical group sessions, (3) provision of technical assistive devices, (4) goal-directed training and (5) community communication and advocacy. The other group will receive usual care. The outcome of the intervention will be assessed before and after the intervention and will be measured at three levels: (1) child, (2) caregiver and (3) community. Standard analysis methods for randomised controlled trial will be used to compare groups. Retention of effects will be examined at 12-month follow-up. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (SS 5173) and registered in accordance with WHO and ICMJE standards. Written informed consent will be obtained from caregivers. Results will be disseminated among participants and stakeholders through public engagement events, scientific reports and conference presentations.

The purpose of this study was to examine differences in mental health between university students in nine countries during the pandemic. The study encompassed 2349 university students (69% female) from Colombia, the Czech Republic (Czechia), Germany, Israel, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, Turkey, and Ukraine. Participants underwent the following tests: Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Exposure to COVID-19 (EC-19), Perceived Impact of Coronavirus (PIC) on students’ well-being, Physical Activity (PA), and General Self-Reported Health (GSRH). The one-way ANOVA showed significant differences between countries. The highest depression and anxiety risk occurred in Turkey, the lowest depression in the Czech Republic and the lowest anxiety in Germany. The χ(2) independence test showed that EC-19, PIC, and GSRH were associated with anxiety and depression in most of the countries, whereas PA was associated in less than half of the countries. Logistic regression showed distinct risk factors for each country. Gender and EC-19 were the most frequent predictors of depression and anxiety across the countries. The role of gender and PA for depression and anxiety is not universal and depends on cross-cultural differences. Students’ mental health should be addressed from a cross-cultural perspective.","Ochnik, Dominika; Rogowska, Aleksandra M.; Kuśnierz, Cezary; Jakubiak, Monika; Schütz, Astrid; Held, Marco J.; Arzenšek, Ana; Benatov, Joy; Berger, Rony; Korchagina, Elena V.; Pavlova, Iuliia; Blažková, Ivana; Konečná, Zdeňka; Aslan, Imran; Çınar, Orhan; Cuero-Acosta, Yonni Angel; Wierzbik-Strońska, Magdalena",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10132882; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34209619/,571
671971,A Phenomenological Analysis of COVID-19,2021-05-25,"Background: Research in the fields of musculoskeletal tissue engineering and regenerative medicine may suffer a slowdown during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic emergency. This is likely to harm the development of new therapeutic strategies and their translation into the clinic in the long term. Recently, the need to maintain continuity in research activities in those fields has assumed even greater importance due to the accumulation of data concerning the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the musculoskeletal system. This study is aimed at the identification of a series of safe handling practices against COVID-19 diffusion to apply in a research environment, thus allowing the maintenance of research lab activities. Methods: The control measures to apply to mitigate the COVID-19 risk were identified and categorized utilizing the Hierarchy of Controls. We also compared our analysis with that assessed before the pandemic to consider the additional risk of COVID-19. Results: Results highlighted that the most relevant implemented measures to control SARS-CoV-2 were based on protecting people through engineering (e.g., ventilation and social distancing), and administrative (e.g., hand sanitization, work shifts) measures or Personnel Protective Equipment, rather than eliminating hazards at the source (e.g., smart working). Conclusions: Work continuity in research labs during the COVID-19 emergency should be guaranteed by ensuring the protection of researchers in the workplace and considering the physical environment, the type of operators and work activity, and the proven ability of workers to face biological risks. The increased knowledge and awareness on lab’ risks should be useful to prevent and mitigate future viral outbreaks.","Roseti, Livia; Grigolo, Brunella",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18116110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34198945/,571

System dynamic modelling, comprised of stock flow and infection modelling, was used to describe regional population dynamics and estimate assumed region-specific transmission rates. The estimated regional transmission rates were then mapped against actual patient data throughout the course of the interventions. This modelling, together with simulation studies, demonstrated the effectiveness of inbound traveler quarantine and resident self-isolation policies and practices. A causal loop approach was taken to link societal factors to infection control measures. This causal loop modelling suggested that the only effective measure against COVID-19 transmission in the Japanese context was intervention in the early stages of the outbreak by national and regional governments, and no social self-strengthening dynamics were demonstrated. These findings may contribute to an understanding of how social resilience to future infectious disease threats can be developed.","Niwa, Makoto; Hara, Yasushi; Sengoku, Shintaro; Kodama, Kota",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32867280/,571

The gene was detected in 37.2% and 48.0% in the former and the latter, respectively, suggesting that canine kobuvirus (CaKoV) is circulating among Japanese dogs. From the result of the latter, however, CaKoV may not be a primary pathogen. Furthermore, all gene-positive dogs were purebreds aged four months or younger. This finding suggests that CaKoV endemic is confined in multi-dog environments, and the dogs have a strong age-dependent resistance to CaKoV.","SOMA, Takehisa; MATSUBAYASHI, Makoto; SASAI, Kazumi",J Vet Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27488907/,571

674606,Intranasal Vaccination Strategy to Control the COVID-19 Pandemic from a Veterinary Medicine Perspective,2021-06-24,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by hyperinflammation and coagulopathy. Severe cases often develop respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation and with critical cases progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Control of hyperinflammation has been proposed as a possible therapeutic avenue for COVID-19; extracorporeal blood purification (EBP) modalities offer an attractive mean to ameliorate maladaptive inflammation. With this work, we evaluated the longitudinal changes of systemic inflammatory markers in critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with blood purification using AN69ST (oXiris®) haemofilter. METHODS: We performed a time-series analysis of 44 consecutive COVID-19 cases treated with the AN69ST (oXiris®) cytokine adsorbing haemofilter (CAH) according to local practice; we visualize longitudinal results of biochemical, inflammatory, blood gas, and vital sign parameters focussing on systemic levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin. RESULTS: All patients were treated with ≥1 cycle extracorporeal continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH) with CAH; of these, 30 severe patients received CVVH-CAH within 4–12 h of admission after recognizing a hyper-inflammatory state. Another 14 patients admitted with mild-to-moderate symptoms progressed to severe disease and were placed on EBP during hospitalization. The treatment was associated with a reduction of ferritin, CRP, fibrinogen, several inflammatory markers, and a resolution of numerous cytopenias. The observed mortality across the cohort was 36.3%. CONCLUSION: EBP with CAH was associated with a decrease in CRP, and control of IL-6 and procalcitonin.","Rosalia, Rodney Alexander; Ugurov, Petar; Neziri, Dashurie; Despotovska, Simona; Kostoska, Emilija; Veljanovska-Kiridjievska, Lidija; Kuzmanov, Dimche; Trifunovski, Aleksandar; Popevski, Dijana; Villa, Gianluca; Mitrev, Zan",Blood Purif,https://doi.org/10.1159/000515627; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34126617/,571
674746,A Dynamical Map to Describe Covid-19 Epidemics,2021-03-12,"Physical distancing has been argued as one of the effective means to combat the spread of COVID-19 before a vaccine or therapeutic drug becomes available. How far people can be spatially separated is partly behavioral but partly constrained by population density. Most models developed to predict the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. do not include population density explicitly. This study shows that population density is an effective predictor of cumulative infection cases in the U.S. at the county level. Daily cumulative cases by counties are converted into 7-day moving averages. Treating the weekly averages as the dependent variable and the county population density levels as the explanatory variable, both in logarithmic scale, this study assesses how population density has shaped the distributions of infection cases across the U.S. from early March to late May, 2020. Additional variables reflecting the percentages of African Americans, Hispanic-Latina, and older adults in logarithmic scale are also included. Spatial regression models with a spatial error specification are also used to account for the spatial spillover effect. Population density alone accounts for 57% of the variation (R-squared) in the aspatial models and up to 76% in the spatial models. Adding the three population subgroup percentage variables raised the R-squared of the aspatial models to 72% and the spatial model to 84%. The influences of the three population subgroups were substantial, but changed over time, while the contributions of population density have been quite stable after the first several weeks, ascertaining the importance of population density in shaping the spread of infection in individual counties, and in their neighboring counties. Thus, population density and sizes of vulnerable population subgroups should be explicitly included in transmission models that predict the impacts of COVID-19, particularly at the sub-county level.","Wong, David W.

Methods: The data of daily HFMD incidence in Ningbo from January 2014 to November 2017 were set as the training set, and the data of December 2017 were set as the test set. ARIMA and LSTM models combined and uncombined with exogenous meteorological variables were adopted to fit the daily incidence of HFMD by using the data of the training set. The forecasting performances of the four fitted models were verified by using the data of the test set. Root mean square error (RMSE) was selected as the main measure to evaluate the performance of the models. Results: The RMSE for multivariate LSTM, univariate LSTM, ARIMA and ARIMAX (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model with Exogenous Input Variables) was 10.78, 11.20, 12.43 and 14.73, respectively. The LSTM model with exogenous meteorological variables has the best performance among the four models and meteorological variables can increase the prediction accuracy of LSTM model. For the ARIMA model, exogenous meteorological variables did not increase the prediction accuracy but became the interference factor of the model. Conclusions: Multivariate LSTM is the best among the four models to fit the daily incidence of HFMD in Ningbo. It can provide a scientific method to build the HFMD early warning system and the methodology can also be applied to other communicable diseases.","Zhang, Rui; Guo, Zhen; Meng, Yujie; Wang, Songwang; Li, Shaoqiong; Niu, Ran; Wang, Yu; Guo, Qing; Li, Yonghong",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34200378/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18116174,571

675551,How does Covid-19 affect urban slums? Evidence from settlement leaders in India,2020-12-04,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense RNA enveloped viruses, members of the family Coronaviridae, that cause infections in a broad range of mammals including humans. Several CoV species lead to mild upper respiratory infections typically associated with common colds. However, three human CoV (HCoV) species: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV-1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, are responsible for severe respiratory diseases at the origin of two recent epidemics (SARS and MERS), and of the current COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19), respectively. The easily transmissible SARS-CoV-2, emerging at the end of 2019 in China, spread rapidly worldwide, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare COVID-19 a pandemic. While the world waits for mass vaccination, there is an urgent need for effective drugs as short-term weapons to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this context, the drug repurposing approach is a strategy able to guarantee positive results rapidly. In this regard, it is well known that several nucleoside-mimicking analogs and nucleoside precursors may inhibit the growth of viruses providing effective therapies for several viral diseases, including HCoV infections. Therefore, this review will focus on synthetic nucleosides and nucleoside precursors active against different HCoV species, paying great attention to SARS-CoV-2. This work covers progress made in anti-CoV therapy with nucleoside derivatives and provides insight into their main mechanisms of action.","Borbone, Nicola; Piccialli, Gennaro; Roviello, Giovanni Nicola; Oliviero, Giorgia",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33668428/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26040986,571

Vitamin D had recently been reviewed as one of the factors that may affect the severity in COVID-19. The objective of current study is to analyze the vitamin D level in COVID-19 patients and its impact on the disease severity. After approval from Ethics Committee, M.L.B Medical College the current study was undertaken as continuous prospective observational study of 6 weeks. Participants were COVID-19 patients of age group 30–60 years admitted during the study period of 6 weeks. Study included either asymptomatic COVID-19 patients (Group A) or severely ill patients requiring ICU admission (Group B). Serum concentration of 25 (OH)D, were measured along with serum IL-6; TNFα and serum ferritin. Standard statistical analysis was performed to analyze the differences. Current Study enrolled 154 patients, 91 in Group A and 63 patients in Group B. The mean level of vitamin D (in ng/mL) was 27.89 ± 6.21 in Group A and 14.35 ± 5.79 in Group B, the difference was highly significant. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 32.96% and 96.82% respectively in Group A and Group B. Out of total 154 patients, 90 patients were found to be deficient in vitamin D (Group A: 29; Group B: 61). Serum level of inflammatory markers was found to be higher in vitamin D deficient COVID-19 patients viz. IL-6 level (in pg/mL) 19.34 ± 6.17 vs 12.18 ± 4.29; Serum ferritin 319.17 ± 38.21 ng/mL vs 186.83 ± 20.18 ng/mL; TNFα level (in pg/mL) 13.26 ± 5.64 vs 11.87 ± 3.15. The fatality rate was high in vitamin D deficient (21% vs 3.1%). Vitamin D level is markedly low in severe COVID-19 patients. Inflammatory response is high in vitamin D deficient COVID-19 patients. This all translates into increased mortality in vitamin D deficient COVID-19 patients.

The clinical characteristics, treatment regimen and duration of hospitalization of COVID-19 patients remain unclear in Ghana. METHODS: we retrospectively reviewed the secondary data of 307 discharged COVID-19 patients to characterize their demographics, clinical symptoms, treatment regimen given and duration of hospitalization. RESULTS: the mean age and temperature of the patients were 37.9 years and 36.3°C, respectively. The majority (85.7%) of the cases reviewed were asymptomatic; for those presenting with symptoms, the main ones were cough (50%), fever (29.6%), headache (27.3%), and sore throat (22.7%). Comorbidities were present in 25.1% of the patients; the popularly reported comorbidities were hypertension (71.4%), asthma (7.8%) and diabetes (6.5%). The average duration of hospitalization was 13.8 days, and the duration of hospitalization for patients managed with azithromycin + chloroquine (AZ+CQ) was 10.4 days, followed closely by those managed with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) only, 11.0 days. There was longer duration of hospitalization among patients who received AZ only compared to patients receiving AZ + CQ (3.24 ± 1.10 days, p=0.037; 95% CI 0.11, 6.37). Linear regression analysis showed that the duration of hospitalization for patients who received AZ only was 2.7 days, which was higher than that of patients who received AZ+CQ and HCQ only (95% CI 0.44, 4.93; p=0.019). CONCLUSION: in this cohort of COVID-19 patients, the common symptoms were cough, fever, headache, and sore throat.

We sought to understand the variation in risk of COVID-19-related death across religious groups in England and Wales both before and after the first national lockdown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of usual residents in England and Wales enumerated at the 2011 Census (n=47 873 294, estimated response rate 94%) for risk of death involving COVID-19 using linked death certificates. Cox regression models were estimated to compare risks between religious groups. Time-dependent coefficients were added to the model allowing HRs before and after lockdown period to be estimated separately. RESULTS: Compared with Christians, all religious groups had an elevated risk of death involving COVID-19; the largest age-adjusted HRs were for Muslim and Jewish males at 2.5 (95% CI 2.3 to 2.7) and 2.1 (95% CI 1.9 to 2.5), respectively. The corresponding HRs for Muslim and Jewish females were 1.9 (95% CI 1.7 to 2.1) and 1.5 (95% CI 1.7 to 2.1), respectively. The difference in risk between groups contracted after lockdown. Those who affiliated with no religion had the lowest risk of COVID-19-related death before and after lockdown. CONCLUSION: The majority of the variation in COVID-19 mortality risk was explained by controlling for sociodemographic and geographic determinants; however, those of Jewish affiliation remained at a higher risk of death compared with all other groups. Lockdown measures were associated with reduced differences in COVID-19 mortality rates between religious groups; further research is required to understand the causal mechanisms.","Gaughan, Charlotte Hannah; Ayoubkhani, Daniel; Nafilyan, Vahe; Goldblatt, Peter; White, Chris; TIngay, Karen; Bannister, Neil",J Epidemiol Community Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33408165/; https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-215694,571

The virus from the first infected case can be spread to upstairs and downstairs through the air duct by the (reverse) stack effect, which explains the air movement in a vertical shaft. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests aerosol transmission, particularly indoors with insufficient ventilation, which is underappreciated.","Hwang, Seo Eun; Chang, Je Hwan; Oh, Bumjo; Heo, Jongho",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220325583; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.12.035; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220325583; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33346125/,571
677332,128 Attitudes Towards the COVID-19 Vaccine in an Inner-City Dialysis Population,2021-04-30,"PURPOSE: Healthcare workers must ensure effective infection prevention and control (IPC) to prevent nosocomial spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. This questionnaire study aims to evaluate Canadian critical care and emergency department nurses’ readiness to follow IPC guidelines in their workplace, and to understand their perceptions of trust in organizational preparedness, communication, and infection risk. METHODS: We adapted an internationally distributed survey for the Canadian context. This cross-sectional questionnaire, incorporating validated scales for items including institutional trust, was distributed by email to nurses via the Canadian Association of Critical Care Nurses and the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians networks between 16 March and 25 May 2020. We evaluated intensive care unit and emergency department nurses’ adherence to IPC protocols, barriers and facilitators to IPC guideline adherence, and their level of institutitonal trust. RESULTS: Three hundred and nineteen nurses responded to the survey. There was higher trust in organizational preparedness among nurses who were older (B = 0.31, P < 0.001) and more experienced (F = 18.09, P < 0.001), and particularly among those with previous experience working in outbreak settings (F = 7.87, P = 0.005). Compared with those without experience working in outbreak settings, respondents with this experience reported higher levels of fear of becoming ill and fear of providing care for COVID-19 patients (χ(2) = 21.48, P = 0.002 and χ(2) = 12.61, P = 0.05, respectively). Older and more experienced nurses reported greater comfort with IPC skills and easier access to personal protective equipment. While the vast majority (96%) of respondents reported using masks and gloves, only 83% had access to isolation facilities for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION: Canadian nurses had strong self-reported adherence to IPC measures and personal protective equipment use. There were high levels of trust in health system leadership to ensure protective measures are present and reliable. Trust was particularly high among older and more experienced nurses despite these populations reporting higher levels of fear of personal illness.

677732,When will the Covid-19 epidemic fade out?,2020-03-30,"INTRODUCTION: two months into the COVID-19 pandemic in Cameroon, we assess the trend in the knowledge, attitude and practices of the population with the progression of the disease and the implementation of preventive methods put in place by the government of Cameroon and health partners organizations in response to the pandemic. METHODS: this was a cross-sectional study conducted in selected health areas in the Buea municipality. A questionnaire was administered at the onset and two months later to collect data on the participants´ knowledge, attitude and practices towards COVID-19. The data were analyzed in SPSS version 25. RESULTS: a total of 480 and 680 participants were sampled at onset and two months later respectively. Of the 26 indicators of knowledge assessed, 22 (84.61%) showed significant increase (p<0.05) with the most significant changes observed with the symptoms, mode of transmission and prevention of the disease. The overall proportion of people with correct knowledge moved from 9.1% at onset to 41.4% two months after. Only 1.5% of participants had poor knowledge of the pandemic two months after against 14.2% at the onset. There was a significant (p<0.05) positive change in the population perception, attitude and practices toward COVID-19 two months after the onset of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: the population knowledge, attitude and practices on COVID-19 showed a positive trend two months after the onset of the pandemic. The implementation of government and health stakeholder preventive measures together with the incidence of the pandemic in Cameroon probably had a positive impact on the positive trend observed. There is a need for continuous sensitization to completely fill the knowledge gap of the population on COVID-19.","Mandaah, Forlemu Vanessa; Nicholas, Tendongfor; Esemu, Seraphine Nkie; Vanessa, Amana Bokagne Therese; Destin, Kouam Talla Gilchrist; Atiepoh, Nganyewo Cynthia; Vanessa, Lambou Fopa",Pan Afr Med J,https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2020.37.134.24821; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33425167/,571

679196,Gender- and age-related differences in misuse of face masks in COVID-19 prevention in central European cities,2020-11-13,"BACKGROUND: Worldwide, Peru has one of the highest infection fatality rates of COVID-19, and its capital city, Lima, accumulates roughly 50% of diagnosed cases. Despite surveillance efforts to assess the extent of the pandemic, reported cases and deaths only capture a fraction of its impact due to COVID-19′s broad clinical spectrum. This study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Lima, stratified by age, sex, region, socioeconomic status (SES), overcrowding, and symptoms. METHODS: We conducted a multi-stage, population-based serosurvey in Lima, between June 28th and July 9th, 2020, after 115 days of the index case and after the first peak cases. We collected whole blood samples by finger-prick and applied a structured questionnaire. A point-of-care rapid serological test assessed IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Seroprevalence estimates were adjusted by sampling weights and test performance. Additionally, we performed RT-PCR molecular assays to seronegatives and estimated the infection prevalence. FINDINGS: We enrolled 3212 participants from 797 households and 241 sample clusters from Lima in the analysis. The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 20·8% (95%CI 17·2–23·5), and the prevalence was 25·2% (95%CI 22·5–28·2). Seroprevalence was equally distributed by sex (aPR=0·96 [95%CI 0·85–1·09, p = 0·547]) and across all age groups, including ≥60 versus ≤11 years old (aPR=0·96 [95%CI 0·73–1·27, p = 0·783]). A gradual decrease in SES was associated with higher seroprevalence (aPR=3·41 [95%CI 1·90–6·12, p<0·001] in low SES). Also, a gradual increase in the overcrowding index was associated with higher seroprevalence (aPR=1·99 [95%CI 1·41–2·81, p<0·001] in the fourth quartile). Seroprevalence was also associated with contact with a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case, whether a household member (48·9%, aPR=2·67 [95%CI 2·06–3·47, p<0·001]), other family members (27·3%, aPR=1·66 [95%CI 1·15–2·40, p = 0·008]) or a workmate (34·1%, aPR=2·26 [95%CI 1·53–3·35, p<0·001]). More than half of seropositive participants reported never having had symptoms (56·1%, 95% CI 49·7–62·3). INTERPRETATION: This first estimate of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Lima shows an intense transmission scenario, despite the government's numerous interventions early established. Susceptibles across age groups show that physical distancing interventions must not be relaxed. SES and overcrowding households are associated with seroprevalence. This study highlights the importance of considering the existing social inequalities for implementing the response to control transmission in low- and middle-income countries.","Reyes-Vega, Mary F.; Soto-Cabezas, M.Gabriela; Cárdenas, Fany; Martel, Kevin S.; Valle, Andree; Valverde, Juan; Vidal-Anzardo, Margot; Falcón, María Elena; Munayco, César V.",EClinicalMedicine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S258953702100081X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33817611/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S258953702100081X,571
679492,Modelling the impact of contact tracing of symptomatic individuals on the COVID-19 epidemic,2021-03-19,"BACKGROUND: Most patients with COVID-19 receive antibiotics despite the fact that bacterial co-infections are rare. This can lead to increased complications, including antibacterial resistance. We aim to analyze risk factors for inappropriate antibiotic prescription in these patients and describe possible complications arising from their use. METHODS: The SEMI-COVID-19 Registry is a multicenter, retrospective patient cohort. Patients with antibiotic were divided into two groups according to appropriate or inappropriate prescription, depending on whether the patient fulfill any criteria for its use. Comparison was made by means of multilevel logistic regression analysis. Possible complications of antibiotic use were also identified. RESULTS: Out of 13,932 patients, 3047 (21.6%) were prescribed no antibiotics, 6116 (43.9%) were appropriately prescribed antibiotics, and 4769 (34.2%) were inappropriately prescribed antibiotics. The following were independent factors of inappropriate prescription: February-March 2020 admission (OR 1.54, 95%CI 1.18–2.00), age (OR 0.98, 95%CI 0.97–0.99), absence of comorbidity (OR 1.43, 95%CI 1.05–1.94), dry cough (OR 2.51, 95%CI 1.94–3.26), fever (OR 1.33, 95%CI 1.13–1.56), dyspnea (OR 1.31, 95%CI 1.04–1.69), flu-like symptoms (OR 2.70, 95%CI 1.75–4.17), and elevated C-reactive protein levels (OR 1.01 for each mg/L increase, 95% CI 1.00–1.01). Adverse drug reactions were more frequent in patients who received ANTIBIOTIC (4.9% vs 2.7%, p < .001). CONCLUSION: The inappropriate use of antibiotics was very frequent in COVID-19 patients and entailed an increased risk of adverse reactions. It is crucial to define criteria for their use in these patients. Knowledge of the factors associated with inappropriate prescribing can be helpful.","Calderón-Parra, Jorge; Muiño-Miguez, Antonio; Bendala-Estrada, Alejandro D.; Ramos-Martínez, Antonio; Muñez-Rubio, Elena; Fernández Carracedo, Eduardo; Tejada Montes, Javier; Rubio-Rivas, Manuel; Arnalich-Fernandez, Francisco; Beato Pérez, Jose Luis; García Bruñén, Jose Miguel; del Corral Beamonte, Esther; Pesqueira Fontan, Paula Maria; Carmona, Maria del Mar; Fernández-Madera Martínez, Rosa; González García, Andrés; Salazar Mosteiro, Cristina; Tuñón de Almeida, Carlota; González Moraleja, Julio; Deodati, Francesco; Martín Escalante, María Dolores; Asensio Tomás, María Luisa; Gómez Huelgas, Ricardo; Casas Rojo, José Manuel; Millán Núñez-Cortés, Jesús",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974637/,571

679511,Analysis and Prediction of COVID-19 Characteristics Using a Birth-and-Death Model,2020-06-24,"BACKGROUND: Introducing welfare technology in home-based palliative care has been suggested to be beneficial for improving access to health care at home and enhancing patients’ feelings of security and safety. However, little is known about the experiences of municipal health-care professionals using welfare technology in palliative home care. The aim of this study was to explore municipal health-care professionals’ experiences regarding the significant challenges, facilitators, and assessments associated with implementing a technological solution named “remote home care” in palliative home care for patients with cancer. METHODS: A qualitative, descriptive, exploratory design was used. Data were collected through focus-group interviews and individual semi-structured interviews with interdisciplinary health-care professionals who had experience using remote home care in clinical encounters with cancer patients who were in the palliative phase and living at home. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Three themes were identified: 1) shifting from objective measures to assessing priorities for patients, 2) lack of experience and personal distress regarding cancer inhibits professional care, and 3) prominent organizational challenges undermine the premise of remote home care. CONCLUSION: The results showed that shifting from a disease-focused to a person-centered approach enables health-care professionals to assess patients’ personal priorities. However, health-care professionals’ uncertainty and lack of knowledge and experience, along with organizational issues concerning information-sharing, represent great challenges that have the potential to inhibit professional care. The availability of networks through which difficult issues can be discussed was highlighted as being a fundamental resource for facilitating the provision of care.","Oelschlägel, Lina; Dihle, Alfhild; Christensen, Vivi L.; Heggdal, Kristin; Moen, Anne; Österlind, Jane; Steindal, Simen A.",BMC Palliat Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34535125/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12904-021-00844-w,571

The causes of death in COVID‐19 are frequently compared to a seasonal influenza outbreak. Complete COVID‐19 autopsy studies were almost non‐existent in the first months of the outbreak and are still rare with respect to the number of deaths. It has been recently reported that capillary microthrombi are significantly more prevalent in patients with COVID‐19 than in patients with influenza A. To date, the contribution of macrothrombi, i.e. visible thrombi in pulmonary arteries, to the death of patients with influenza A in comparison to COVID‐19 remains unaddressed. Here, we report autopsy findings in 411 patients who died from the ‘Spanish’ influenza A pandemic between May 1918 and April 1919 at the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland. We compare these results with influenza A autopsies from 2009 to 2020, other influenza A autopsy series and all COVID‐19 autopsies published to date. No descriptions of any macroscopic thromboembolic events were mentioned in influenza A autopsy reports. In 75 published COVID‐19 autopsies, pulmonary artery thrombosis/embolism was reported in 36%. The direct comparison of macroscopic autopsy findings suggests a significantly greater degree of grossly visible pulmonary macrothrombi in patients with COVID‐19 in comparison to influenza A autopsies even though most patients received empiric thromboprophylaxis. This is consistent with the concept of a SARS‐related de novo coagulopathy with generalised in situ clot formation, which could explain the high incidence of pulmonary thrombosis/embolism with or without underlying deep vein thrombosis and in the absence of a history of venous thromboembolic events.","Burkhard‐Koren, Nina Maria; Haberecker, Martina; Maccio, Umberto; Ruschitzka, Frank; Schuepbach, Reto A; Zinkernagel, Annelies S; Hardmeier, Thomas; Varga, Zsuzsanna; Moch, Holger",J Pathol Clin Res,https://doi.org/10.1002/cjp2.189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33185036/,571

However, no ACE2 inhibitors have shown definite beneficiaries for COVID-19 patients, applying the presence of another receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Here we show that ACE2 knockout dose not completely block virus entry, while TfR directly interacts with virus Spike protein to mediate virus entry and SARS-CoV-2 can infect mice with over-expressed humanized transferrin receptor (TfR) and without humanized ACE2. TfR-virus co-localization is found both on the membranes and in the cytoplasma, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 transporting by TfR, the iron-transporting receptor shuttling between cell membranes and cytoplasma. Interfering TfR-Spike interaction blocks virus entry to exert significant anti-viral effects. Anti-TfR antibody (EC50 ~16.6 nM) shows promising anti-viral effects in mouse model.

One of the greatest challenges in online education is preserving the academic integrity of student assessments. The lack of direct supervision by instructors during final examinations poses a significant risk of academic misconduct. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detecting potential cases of cheating on the final exam using machine learning techniques. We treat the issue of identifying the potential cases of cheating as an outlier detection problem. We use students’ continuous assessment results to identify abnormal scores on the final exam. However, unlike a standard outlier detection task in machine learning, the student assessment data requires us to consider its sequential nature. We address this issue by applying recurrent neural networks together with anomaly detection algorithms. Numerical experiments on a range of datasets show that the proposed method achieves a remarkably high level of accuracy in detecting cases of cheating on the exam. We believe that the proposed method would be an effective tool for academics and administrators interested in preserving the academic integrity of course assessments.","Kamalov, Firuz; Sulieman, Hana; Santandreu Calonge, David",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34347794/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254340,571
679906,"Police brutality, medical mistrust and unmet need for medical care",2021-03-23,"ObjectivesTo determine the impact of restrictions on mobility on reducing transmission of COVID-19. DesignDaily incidence rates lagged by 14 days were regressed on mobility changes using LOESS regression and logit regression between the day of the 100th case in each country to August 31, 2020. Setting34 OECD countries plus Singapore and Taiwan. ParticipantsGoogle mobility data were obtained from people who turned on mobile device-based global positioning system (GPS) and agreed to share their anonymized position information with Google. InterventionsWe examined the association of COVID-19 incidence rates with mobility changes, defined as changes in categories of domestic location, against a pre-pandemic baseline, using country-specific daily incidence data on newly confirmed COVID-19 cases and mobility data. ResultsIn two thirds of examined countries, reductions of up to 40% in commuting mobility (to workplaces, transit stations, retailers, and recreation) were associated with decreased COVID-19 incidence, more so early in the pandemic. However, these decreases plateaued as mobility remained low or decreased further. We found smaller or negligible associations between mobility restriction and incidence rates in the late phase in most countries. ConclusionMild to moderate degrees of mobility restriction in most countries were associated with reduced incidence rates of COVID-19 that appear to attenuate over time, while some countries exhibited no effect of such restrictions. More detailed research is needed to precisely understand the benefits and limitations of mobility restrictions as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICSince SARS-CoV-2 became a pandemic, restrictions on mobility such as limitations on travel and closure of offices, restaurants, and shops have been imposed in an unprecedented way in both scale and scope to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the absence of effective treatment options or a vaccine. Although mobility restriction has also brought about tremendous costs such as negative economic growth and other collateral impacts on health such as increased morbidity and mortality from lack of access to other essential health services, little evidence exists on the effectiveness of mobility restriction for the prevention of disease transmission. A search of PUBMED and Google Scholar for publications on this topic through Sep 20, 2020 revealed that most of the evidence on the effectiveness of physical distancing comes from mathematical modeling studies using a variety of assumptions. One study investigated only the combined effect of several interventions, including physical distancing, among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSThis is the first study to investigate the association between change in mobility and incidence of COVID-19 globally using real-time measures of mobility at the population level. For this, we used Google Global Mobility data and the daily incidence of COVID-19 for 36 countries from the day of 100th case detection through August 31, 2020. Our findings from LOESS regression show that in two-thirds of countries, reductions of up to 40% in commuting mobility were associated with decreased COVID-19 incidence, more so early in the pandemic. This decrease, however, plateaued as mobility decreased further. We found that associations between mobility restriction and incidence became smaller or negligible in the late phase of the pandemic in most countries. The reduced incidence rate of COVID-19 cases with a mild to moderate degree of mobility restriction in most countries suggests some value to limited mobility restriction in early phases of epidemic mitigation. The lack of impact in some others, however, suggests further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the distinguishing factors for when mobility restrictions are helpful in decreasing viral transmission. Governments should carefully consider the level and period of mobility restriction necessary to achieve the desired benefits and minimize harm.","Oh, Juhwan; Lee, Hwa-Young; Long, Khuong Quynh; Marcuns, Jeffery F; Bullen, Chris; Barrios, Osvaldo Enrique Artaza; Hwang, Seung-sik; Suh, Young Sahng; McCool, Judith; Kaucher, S.

679958,Short-run environmental effects of COVID-19: Evidence from forest fires,2020-07-31,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted health systems worldwide. There is a continuing need for clinicians to adapt practice to facilitate timely provision of medical care, whilst minimising horizontal transmission. Guidance and recommendations are increasingly available, and this rapid review aimed to provide a timely evidence synthesis on the current recommendations surrounding urogynaecological care. METHODS: We performed a literature review using PubMed/Medline, Embase and Cochrane and a manual search of national and international societies for management recommendations for urogynaecological patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Nine guidance documents and 17 articles, including 10 reviews, were included. Virtual clinics are recommended for new and follow-up patients, to assess and initiate treatment, as well as triage patients who require face-to-face appointments. Outpatient investigations such as urodynamics and cystoscopy for benign indications can be deferred. Prolapse and continence surgery should be suspended, except in specific circumstances such as procidentia with upper tract complications and failed pessaries. There is no evidence to support a particular route of surgery, but recommendations are made to minimise COVID-19 transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Urogynaecological patients face particular challenges owing to inherent vulnerabilities of these populations. Behavioural and medical therapies should be recommended as first line options and initiated via virtual or remote clinics, which are integral to management during the COVID-19 pandemic. Expanding the availability and accessibility of technology will be increasingly required. The majority of outpatient and inpatient procedures can be deferred, but the longer-term effects of such practices are unclear.

We will evaluate the effect of an online chronic disease self-management programme (CDSMP) plus medication adherence tools on systolic blood pressure (SBP) (primary aim) and, seek to understand the barriers and facilitators to implementation of this modified CDSMP in faith-based organisations (FBOs) (secondary aim). METHODS: We will conduct an unblinded cluster randomised trial in FBOs throughout Barbados. Eligibility: Persons ages 35–70 years; a previous diagnosis of hypertension or currently on antihypertensive therapy and the occurrence of two or more blood pressure readings above 130 mm Hg (systolic) or 80 mm Hg (diastolic) on the day of recruitment. Persons not known to have hypertension but who have two or more blood pressure readings at or above 130 mm Hg (systolic) or 80 mm Hg (diastolic) on two recruitment days at least 1 week apart will also be eligible. The unit of randomisation is a church cluster which consists of 7–9 churches. We will perform block randomisation to assign 24 clusters to intervention or control. The intervention has three components: modified CDSMP workshops, distribution of medication pill boxes and use of social media (WhatsApp V.2.0) to encourage medication adherence. Controls will receive one didactic lecture only. We will determine the mean changes in SBP levels for the intervention group versus controls and compare differences in outcomes 6 months’ post intervention using mixed effects regression models. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This project has received ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board of the University of the West Indies in Barbados.

During the past 10 years, advances in this field allowed to achieve more and more sophisticated CyDs derivatives opening a simple access in scale-up quantities to original and better CyD-based gene delivery systems. In addition, possibility to combine covalent and supramolecular approaches offers new venues for the design of tailor-made CyD-based nanovehicles to improve their transfection ability and gene transfer in cells. In this account, we describe our recent progress in the construction of a novel CyD-based G0 (generation number) core dendrimer, scalable to CyD oligomers by a strategy using protonable guanidine tethers and whose concept can be generalized for the assembly of CyD pre-coated dendrimers. The synthetic strategy based on an original Staudinger-Aza-Wittig tandem coupling reaction. We present an outline of the different analytical strategies to characterize CyD-ODN (cyclodextrin-oligodeoxynucleotide) complexes. Among them, Capillary electrophoresis (CE) was used to perfectly characterize our CyD-siRNA and CyD-DNA complexes and shown to be a very attractive method with advantages of low sample consumption, rapid analysis speed, and high efficiency that make this technology a major tool for association constant measurement. Finally, we present the different biological methods that can be used, in vitro, to study gene delivery, and more precisely ones we have performed to evaluate the capability of our original model bis-guanidinium-tetrakis-β-cyclodextrin dendrimeric tetrapod, to deliver efficiently DNA or siRNA in eukaryotic cells.","Duval, R.-E.; Clarot, I.; Dumarcay-Charbonnier, F.; Fontanay, S.; Marsura, A.",Ann Pharm Fr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23177563/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003450912001447; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pharma.2012.09.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003450912001447,571

We explore the consequences for travel inside a given region, in this case Mexico, particularly focusing on airplane transportation but attempting to give a gross approximation to terrestrial movement since this is the main form of population movement across geographical areas in the country; then we proceed to study the effect of behavioral changes required to lower transmission by lowering the contact rate and infection probability and lastly, we explore the consequences of disease spread in a population subject to social isolation.These models are not suitable for predictive purposes although some rough predictions can be extracted from them. They are presented as a tool that can serve to explore plausible scenarios of spread and impact, effectiveness and consequences of contention and mitigation policies. Given the early stage at which the epidemic is at the date of writing in Mexico, we hope these ideas can be helpful for the understanding of the importance of isolation, social distancing and screening of the general population.","Acuna-Zegarra, Manuel Adrian; Comas-Garcia, Andreu; Hernandez-Vargas, Esteban; Santana-Cibrian, Mario; Velasco-Hernandez, Jorge X.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.28.20046276,571

Now the world is ravaged by COVID-19, with tremendous loss of life, economic and societal disruption, and dire predictions of more destructive and frequent pandemics. There are now calls to tightly regulate and even enact complete wildlife trade bans, while others call for more nuanced approaches since many rural communities rely on wildlife for sustenance. Given pressures from political and societal drivers and resource limitations to enforcing bans, increased regulation is a more likely outcome rather than broad bans. But imposition of tight regulations will require monitoring and assessing trade situations for zoonotic risks. We present a tool for relevant stakeholders, including government authorities in the public health and wildlife sectors, to assess wildlife trade situations for risks of potentially serious zoonoses in order to inform policies to tightly regulate and control the trade, much of which is illegal in most countries. The tool is based on available knowledge of different wildlife taxa traded in the Asia-Pacific Region and known to carry highly virulent and transmissible viruses combined with relative risks associated with different broad categories of market types and trade chains.","Wikramanayake, Eric; Pfeiffer, Dirk U.; Magouras, Ioannis; Conan, Anne; Ziegler, Stefan; Bonebrake, Timothy C.; Olson, David",One Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771421000690; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2021.100279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34195344/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352771421000690,571

To analyze the application of corticosteroids in patients with severe pneumonia. We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, clinical characteristics, corticosteroids use, and outcomes of the 65 confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital from Jan 20 to Feb 23, 2020. The final follow-up date observed was April 15th, 2020. The number of patients with mild, general, severe, and critical type were 10 (15.38%), 32 (49.23%), 8 (12.31%), and 15 (23.08%), respectively. The median incubation period was 6 days. Notable outliers were 1 patient at 16 days and 1 patient at 21 days. In lymphocyte subgroup analysis, decreases in total, T, CD4, and CD8 lymphocytes were more common as the disease worsened (All P < 0.05). Methylprednisolone (mPSL) was applied to 31 (47.69%) patients with pneumonia, including 10 (31.25%) general, 8 (100%) severe, and 13 (86.67%) critical patients, respectively. Corticosteroids inhibited Interleukin-6(IL-6) production (P = 0.0215) but did not affect T lymphocyte (P = 0.0796). There was no significant difference between patients using lower dose (≤ 2 mg/kg day) and higher dose (> 2 mg/kg day) mPSL in inhibiting IL-6 production (P = 0.5856). Thirty of 31 patients (96.77%) had stopped mPSL due to improvement of pneumonia. Virus RNA clearance time lengthened with disease progression (P = 0.0001). In general type, there was no significant difference in virus clearance time between patients with (15, 12-19 days) and without (14.5, 11-18 days) (P = 0.7372) mPSL use. Lymphocyte, especially T lymphocyte, in severe and critical patients showed a dramatic decrease. Application of lower dose corticosteroids (≤ 2 mg/kg day) could inhibit IL-6 production (a representative of cytokines) as effectively as a higher dose. Proper use corticosteroids in general type patients did not delay virus clearance.","Liu, Fangfang; Ji, Chengcheng; Luo, Jiajun; Wu, Weiwei; Zhang, Junchang; Zhong, Zhiqiang; Lankford, Seth; Huang, Huang; Lin, Fang; Wang, Yonggang; Mo, Guoxin; Hu, Xingshuo; Jiang, Tianjun; Shao, Yanling; Ji, Sumin; Zhang, Yawei; Qin, Enqiang; Mu, Jinsong",Scientific reports,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70387-2.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32792492/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70387-2,571

The mechanism of this sodium disbalance is not well known. AIMS: Characterize the incidence, etiology and prognostic value of sodium disbalance in patients with COVID19. METHOD: Observational pilot study with 37 patients admitted to Hospital Ramon y Cajal in Madrid, Spain, between March and April 2020, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID19. Patients were followed until discharge or death. Clinical and laboratory data were collected at admission and before the clinical outcome. Variables were analyzed comparing hyponatremic vs eunatremic patients. RESULTS: Distribution of patients according to their serum sodium was as follows: 16 patients with hyponatremia (44%), 19 with normal serum sodium (51%) and 2 with hypernatremia (5%). The average sodium level in hyponatremic patients was 130 ±3.2 mmol/l, median urine sodium was 36 ±3.2 mmol/l (only 6 urine sample available). Hyponatremia was associated with dyspnea at admission and with higher levels of LDH, neutrophil cells account and C reactive protein. However, no worse prognostic was associated with lower serum sodium. All patients recover sodium levels at discharge treated with salt supplementation and free water intake. CONCLUSION: mild hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with COVID19. Sing as low urine sodium and recover with water and salt ingestion, point toward hydrosaline dehydration instead of SIADH as most common origin of hyponatremia.","Castillo-Rodríguez, Esmeralda; Villa, Daniel; Álvarez Nadal, Marta; Regueiro Toribio, Paula; Fernandez Lucas, Milagros",Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfab092.0050,571

The circadian rhythm plays a vital role in health, and prolonged clock disruptions are associated with chronic diseases. The relationships between clock genes, aging, and immunosenescence are not well understood. Inflammation is an immune response triggered in living organisms in response to the danger associated with pathogens and injury. The term ‘inflammaging’ has been used to describe the chronic low-grade-inflammation that develops with advancing age and predicts susceptibility to age-related pathologies. Equilibrium between pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines is needed for healthy aging and longevity. Sedentary and poor nutrition style life indices a disruption in circadian rhythm promoting an increase in pro-inflammatory factors or leads for chronic low-grade inflammation. Moreover, signals mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6, might accentuate of the muscle loss during aging. Circadian clock is important to maintain the physiological functions, as maintenance of immune system. A strategy for imposes rhythmicity in the physiological systems may be adopted of exercise training routine. The lifelong regular practice of physical exercise decelerates the processes of aging, providing better quality and prolongation of life. Thus, in this review, we will focus on how aging affects circadian rhythms and its relationship to inflammatory processes (inflammaging), as well as the role of physical exercise as a regulator of the circadian rhythm, promoting aging with rhythmicity.","de Souza Teixeira, Alexandre Abilio; Lira, Fábio Santos; Rosa-Neto, José Cesar",Life Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320520312066; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320520312066?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32956663/,571

The clinical severity of secondary dengue virus (DENV) infections is associated with antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), and it was recently suggested that previous exposure to DENV may worsen ZIKV clinical outcomes. In this Opinion article we analyze the relationship among different flaviviruses and ADE. We discuss new evidence obtained in non-human primates and human cohorts demonstrating that there is no correlation to ADE when ZIKV infection occurs in the presence of pre-existing DENV immunity. We propose a redefinition of ADE in the context of complex immunological flavivirus interactions to provide a more objective perspective when translating in vitro or in vivo observations into the clinical setting.","Sariol, Carlos A.; Nogueira, Mauricio L.; Vasilakis, Nikos",Trends in Microbiology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X17302317; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0966842X17302317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29122447/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2017.10.004; http://www.cell.com/article/S0966842X17302317/pdf,571

Using data from Spain and Italy, we estimate an age dependent infection fatality ratio for SARS-CoV-2, as well as risks of hospitalization and intensive care admission. We use them in a model that simulates the dynamics of the virus using an age structured, spatially detailed agent based approach, that explicitly incorporates governmental interventions and changes in mobility and contact patterns occurred during the COVID-19 outbreak in each country. Our simulations reproduce several of the features of its spatio-temporal spread in the three countries studied. They show that containment measures combined with high density are responsible for the containment of cases within densely populated areas, and that spread to less densely populated areas occurred during the late stages of the first wave. The capability to reproduce observed features of the spatio-temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 makes this model a potential candidate for forecasting the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in other settings, and we recommend its application in low and lower-middle income countries which remain understudied.","Parisi, Andrea; Brand, Samuel P.

Dietary treatments were control (no SDP) or SDP as powder or granular included in the pellet and fed continuously (d 0 to 35) or discontinued after d 14. During the experiment, broilers developed necrotic enteritis, and tissue cultures were positive for Escherichia coli and Salmonella, resulting in 50% mortality on control broilers. Addition of SDP to the feed improved (P < 0.05) average daily gain, feed intake, and feed efficiency for each period of the study (d 0 to 14, 15 to 28, 29 to 35, and 0 to 35). Continuous feeding of SDP improved (P < 0.05) average daily gain, feed intake, and feed efficiency from d 15 to 35 compared with broilers fed SDP to d 14. Liveability was improved (P < 0.05) in broilers consuming SDP either for 14 d or continuously throughout the experiment compared with control broilers. Spray-dried granular plasma was more effective than spray-dried powder plasma from d 0 to 14. The results of this experiment confirmed that SDP improved broiler growth rate, feed intake, feed efficiency, and minimized enteric challenge associated with necrotic enteritis with maximal protection afforded by continuous feeding.

683071,From “It Has Stopped Our Lives” to “Spending More Time Together Has Strengthened Bonds”: The Varied Experiences of Australian Families During COVID-19,2020-10-20,"In eukaryotes and viruses that infect them, the 5′ end of mRNA molecules, and also many other functionally important RNAs, are modified to form a so-called cap structure that is important for interactions of these RNAs with many nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. The RNA cap has multiple roles in gene expression, including enhancement of RNA stability, splicing, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and translation initiation. Apart from guanosine addition to the 5′ end in the most typical cap structure common to transcripts produced by RNA polymerase II (in particular mRNA), essentially all cap modifications are due to methylation. The complexity of the cap structure and its formation can range from just a single methylation of the unprocessed 5′ end of the primary transcript, as in mammalian U6 and 7SK, mouse B2, and plant U3 RNAs, to an elaborate m(7)Gpppm(6,6)AmpAmpCmpm(3)Um structure at the 5′ end of processed RNA in trypanosomes, which are formed by as many as 8 methylation reactions. While all enzymes responsible for methylation of the cap structure characterized to date were found to belong to the same evolutionarily related and structurally similar Rossmann Fold Methyltransferase superfamily, that uses the same methyl group donor, S-adenosylmethionine; the enzymes also exhibit interesting differences that are responsible for their distinct functions. This review focuses on the evolutionary classification of enzymes responsible for cap methylation in RNA, with a focus on the sequence relationships and structural similarities and dissimilarities that provide the basis for understanding the mechanism of biosynthesis of different caps in cellular and viral RNAs. Particular attention is paid to the similarities and differences between methyltransferases from human cells and from human pathogens that may be helpful in the development of antiviral and antiparasitic drugs.","Byszewska, Magdalena; Śmietański, Mirosław; Purta, Elżbieta; Bujnicki, Janusz M",RNA Biol,https://doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2015.1004955; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25626080/,571

Some strains cause clinical syndromes with multiorgan involvement in humans such as hantavirus haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), which is also known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Clinical differentiation of this infection from other endemic infections in Sri Lanka such as leptospirosis and rickettsial infections is extremely difficult due to overlapping clinical and epidemiologic features such as exposure to rodents and farming. Here, we report two serologically confirmed cases of hantavirus infection from Sri Lanka with different presentation. The first patient had a combination of HCPS and HFRS. The second patient was treated for HPS complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Both had a significant clinical, biochemical, and radiological response with early initiation of corticosteroids. However, further studies are required to assess whether steroids hasten the recovery of severe hantavirus infections. We believe that hantavirus infection is an important emerging disease in the country and should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with an acute febrile illness as well as in patients presenting with ARDS.

684945,Defining covid-19 elimination,2021,"ABSTRACT Importance: The incidence and severity of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is higher in men. Sex hormones potentially offer one explanation for differences by sex. Objective: To determine whether men exposed to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) have lower incidence and severity of COVID-19. Design: We conducted an observational study of male Veterans treated in the Veterans Health Administration from February 15th to July 15th, 2020. We developed a propensity score model to predict the likelihood to undergo Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing. We performed multivariable logistic regression modeling adjusted with inverse probability weighting to examine the relationship between ADT and COVID-19 incidence. We conducted logistic regression analysis among COVID-19 patients to test the association between ADT and COVID-19 severity. Setting: The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Participants: The study sample consisted of 6,250,417 male Veterans who were alive as of February 15, 2020. Exposure: Exposure to ADT was defined as having any prescription for a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogue or an antiandrogen in the six months prior to the index date. Main Outcomes and Measures: To assess incidence, we used a binary variable indicating any positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction SARS-CoV-2 test result through July 15, 2020. To measure severity, we constructed a binary variable indicating whether a patient was admitted to the intensive care unit, placed on mechanical ventilation, or dead in the 60 days following a positive test up to July 15, 2020. Results: We identified 246,087 patients who had been tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 3,057 were exposed to ADT, and 36,096 patients with cancer and no ADT exposure. Of these, 295 ADT patients and 2,427 other cancer patients had COVID-19 illness. In the primary, propensity-weighted comparison of ADT patients to cancer patients not on ADT, ADT was associated with decreased likelihood of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (adjusted OR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.81-0.95]; p=0.001). ADT was associated with fewer severe COVID-19 outcomes (OR 0.72 [95% CI 0.53-0.96]; p=0.03).

685061,Autopsy in the time of COVID,2021-01-07,"High antimicrobial usage and multidrug resistance have been reported in veal calves in Europe. This may be attributed to a high risk of disease as veal calves are often purchased from numerous dairy herds, exposed to stress related to the transport and commingling of new animals, and fed a new ration. In this study, we used national register data to characterize the use of antimicrobials registered for large Danish veal calf and young bull producing herds in 2014. A total of 325 herds with veal calf and potentially young bull production were identified from the Danish Cattle database. According to the national Danish database on drugs for veterinary use (VetStat), a total of 537,399 Animal Daily Doses (ADD(200)) were registered for these 325 herds during 2014. The amount of antimicrobials registered in 2014 varied throughout the year, with the highest amounts registered in autumn and winter. Antimicrobials were registered for respiratory disorders (79%), joints/limbs/CNS disorders (17%), gastrointestinal disorders (3.7%) and other disorders (0.3%). Of the registered antimicrobials, 15% were for oral and 85% for parenteral administration. Long-acting formulations with a therapeutic effect of more than 48 h covered 58% of the drugs for parenteral use. Standardized at the herd-level, as ADD(200)/100 calves/day, antimicrobial use distributed as median [CI(95%)] for starter herds (n = 22): 2.14 [0.19;7.58], finisher herds (n = 24): 0.48 [0.00;1.48], full-line herds (n = 183): 0.78 [0.05;2.20] and herds with an inconsistent pattern of movements (n = 96): 0.62 [0.00;2.24]. Full-line herds are herds, which purchase calves directly from a dairy herd and raise them to slaughter. Furthermore, we performed a risk factor analysis on the 183 herds with a full-line production. Here, we investigated, whether the number of suppliers, the number of calves purchased, the frequency of purchase, the average age at introduction, the average time in the herd and vaccination influenced the amount of antimicrobials used in the herds. The final multivariable regression analysis revealed that the number of calves introduced was positively associated with the antimicrobial use in the herd.","Fertner, Mette; Toft, Nils; Martin, Henrik Læssøe; Boklund, Anette",Prev Vet Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587716301921; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27544250/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2016.07.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587716301921,571

We present the recommendations of the Brazilian Society of Nephrology regarding the treatment of pediatric patients with kidney diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Articles and documents from medical societies and government agencies on specific recommendations for children on RRT in relation to COVID-19 as well as those focused on epidemiological aspects of this condition in Brazil Were evaluated and analyzed. RESULTS: We present recommendations on outpatient care, transportation to dialysis centers, peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, and kidney transplantation in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. DISCUSSION: Despite initial observations of higher mortality rates in specific age groups (the elderly) and with comorbidities (obese, diabetics, and those with cardiovascular diseases), patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on RRT are particularly prone to develop COVID-19. Specific measures must be taken to reduce the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 and developing COVID-19, especially during transport to dialysis facilities, as well as on arrival and in contact with other patients.","Tavares, Marcelo de Sousa; Penido, Maria Goretti Moreira Guimarães; de Andrade, Olberes Vitor Braga; Koch, Vera Hermina Kalika; Bernardes, Rejane de Paula; Garcia, Clotilde Druck; Moura-Neto, José A.; Nascimento, Marcelo Mazza; Palma, Lilian Monteiro Pereira",J Bras Nefrol,https://doi.org/10.1590/2175-8239-jbn-2020-s108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32877496/,571

However, functional immunity is mediated by long-lived memory T and B (Bmem) cells. Therefore, we generated fluorescently-labeled tetramers of the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (NCP) to determine the longevity and immunophenotype of SARS-CoV-2-specific Bmem cells in COVID-19 patients. A total of 36 blood samples were obtained from 25 COVID-19 patients between 4 and 242 days post-symptom onset including 11 paired samples. While serum IgG to RBD and NCP was identified in all patients, antibody levels began declining at 20 days post-symptom onset. RBD- and NCP-specific Bmem cells predominantly expressed IgM(+) or IgG1(+) and continued to rise until 150 days. RBD-specific IgG(+) Bmem were predominantly CD27(+), and numbers significantly correlated with circulating follicular helper T cell numbers. Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response contracts in convalescence with persistence of RBD- and NCP-specific Bmem cells. Flow cytometric detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific Bmem cells enables detection of long-term immune memory following infection or vaccination for COVID-19.","Hartley, Gemma E.; Edwards, Emily S.J.; Aui, Pei M.; Varese, Nirupama; Stojanovic, Stephanie; McMahon, James; Peleg, Anton Y.; Boo, Irene; Drummer, Heidi E.; Hogarth, P.

We analyze data obtained from a Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 database to assess the county-level spatial variation of COVID-19-related mortality risk during the early stage of the epidemic in relation to health determinants and health infrastructure. Overall, we identified highly populated and polluted areas, regional air hub areas, race minorities (non-white population), and Hispanic or Latino population with an increased risk of COVID-19-related death during the first phase of the epidemic. The 10 highest COVID-19 mortality risk areas in highly populated counties had on average a lower proportion of white population (48.0%) and higher proportions of black population (18.7%) and other races (33.3%) compared to the national averages of 83.0%, 9.1%, and 7.9%, respectively. The Hispanic and Latino population proportion was higher in these 10 counties (29.3%, compared to the national average of 9.3%). Counties with major air hubs had a 31% increase in mortality risk compared to counties with no airport connectivity. Sixty-eight percent of the counties with high COVID-19-related mortality risk also had lower critical care capacity than the national average. The disparity in health and environmental risk factors might have exacerbated the COVID-19-related mortality risk in vulnerable groups during the early stage of the epidemic.","Correa-Agudelo, Esteban; Mersha, Tesfaye B.; Branscum, Adam J.; MacKinnon, Neil J.; Cuadros, Diego F.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33921217/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18084021,571

687990,Effect of COVID-19 on air quality and pollution in different countries,2021-03-26,"BACKGROUND: To characterize the experience of converting a geriatrics clinic to telehealth visits in early stages of a pandemic. DESIGN: An organizational case study with mixed methods evaluation from the first 8 weeks of converting a geriatrics clinic from in-person visits to video and telephone visits. SETTING: Veteran’s Health Administration in Northern California Participants Community-dwelling older Veterans receiving care at VA Palo Alto Geriatrics clinic. Veterans had a mean age of 85.7 (SD = 6.8) and 72.1% had cognitive impairment. INTERVENTION: Veterans with face-to-face appointments were converted to video or telephone visits to mitigate exposure to community spread of COVID-19. MEASUREMENTS: Thirty-two patient evaluations and 80 clinician feedback evaluations were completed. This provided information on satisfaction, care access during pandemic, and travel and time savings. RESULTS: Of the 62 scheduled appointments, 43 virtual visits (69.4%) were conducted. Twenty-six (60.5%) visits were conducted via video, 17 (39.5%) by telephone. Virtual visits saved patients an average of 118.6 minutes each. Patients and providers had similar, positive perceptions about telehealth to in-person visit comparison, limiting exposure, and visit satisfaction. After the telehealth appointment, patients indicated greater comfort with using virtual visits in the future. Thirty-one evaluations included comments for qualitative analysis. We identified 3 main themes of technology set-up and usability, satisfaction with visit, and clinical assessment and communication. CONCLUSION: During a pandemic that has limited the ability to safely conduct inperson services, virtual formats offer a feasible and acceptable alternative for clinically-complex older patients. Despite potential barriers and additional effort required for telehealth visits, patients expressed willingness to utilize this format. Patients and providers reported high satisfaction, particularly with the ability to access care similar to in-person while staying safe. Investing in telehealth services during a pandemic ensures that vulnerable older patients can access care while maintaining social distancing, an important safety measure.","Iyer, Sowmya; Mehta, Priyanka; Weith, Joanne; Hoang-Gia, Dat; Moore, Janet; Carlson, Chalise; Choe, Philip; Sakai, Erin; Gould, Christine",J Prim Care Community Health,https://doi.org/10.1177/21501327211000235; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33729044/,571
688683,Do COVID-19 cases follow a similar transition path? Evidence from Indian states,2020-12-23,"Human astrovirus (HAstV) constitutes a major cause of acute gastroenteritis in children. The viral 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTR) have been involved in the regulation of several molecular mechanisms. However, in astrovirues have been less characterized. Here, we analyzed the secondary structures of the 5′ and 3′ UTR of HAstV, as well as their putative target sites that might be recognized by cellular factors. To our knowledge, this is the first bioinformatic analysis that predicts the HAstV 5′ UTR secondary structure. The analysis showed that both the UTR sequence and secondary structure are highly conserved in all HAstVs analyzed, suggesting their regulatory role of viral activities. Notably, the UTRs of HAstVs contain putative binding sites for the serine/arginine-rich factors SRSF2, SRSF5, SRSF6, SRSF3, and the multifunctional hnRNPE2 protein. More importantly, putative binding sites for PTB were localized in single-stranded RNA sequences, while hnRNPE2 sites were localized in double-stranded sequence of the HAstV 5′ and 3′ UTR structures. These analyses suggest that the combination of SRSF proteins, hnRNPE2 and PTB described here could be involved in the maintenance of the secondary structure of the HAstVs, possibly allowing the recruitment of the replication complex that selects and recruits viral RNA replication templates.

LEDVT patients (120) and healthy people (120) were taken as case and control objects, respectively. SNPs and their genotypes of FGB promoter were detected by promoter sequencing and PCR-RFLP. The parameters of coagulation system were evaluated. There were 6 SNPs in FGB promoter, which were ß-148C/T, ß-249C/T, ß-455G/A, ß-854G/A, ß-993C/T and ß-1420G/A. The genotype and allele frequency of ß-1420 G/A, ß-455G/A, ß-249c/T and ß-148C/T were significantly different between the LEDVT group and the control group, but not ß-993C/T and ß-854G/A. In addition, we found that the higher the content of Fibrinogen (FG), the higher the risk of LEDVT. The risk of LEDVT increased by 4.579 times for every unit increase of fibrinogen. We also found that FG, PT and APTT in LEDVT group were higher than those in control group, while TT was lower than those in control group; Furthermore, there was no significant difference in all coagulation indexes among 6 SNP genotypes in LEDVT group, while a significant difference was found between the 2 genotypes of ß-993C/T in the control group. ß-993C/T may indirectly affect the susceptibility of LEDVT by improving the basic level of plasma FG.","Han, Shengbin; Yang, Bin; Feng, Yaoyu; Zhao, Lingfeng; Feng, Qun; Guan, Hongxi; Song, Donghui; Yin, Fang; Zhuang, Li",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34583575/; https://doi.org/10.1177/1076029620967108,571

Methods: A total of 370 patients with COVID-19 were consecutively enrolled at The Third People’s Hospital of Yichang from January to March 2020. COVID-19 was diagnosed according to the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment plan released by the National Health and Health Committee of China. Effect-size estimates are summarized as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: 326 patients were diagnosed with mild or ordinary COVID-19, and 44 with severe or critical COVID-19. After propensity score matching and statistical adjustment, eight factors were significantly associated with severe or critical COVID-19 (p <0.05) relative to mild or ordinary COVID-19. Due to strong pairwise correlations, only five factors, including diagnostic delay (OR, 95% CI, p: 1.08, 1.02 to 1.17, 0.048), albumin (0.82, 0.75 to 0.91, <0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (1.56, 1.14 to 2.13, 0.011), white blood cell (1.27, 1.08 to 1.50, 0.004), and neutrophil (1.40, 1.16 to 1.70, <0.001), were retained for model construction and performance assessment. The nomogram model based on the five factors had good prediction capability and accuracy (C-index: 90.6%).

We aimed to evaluate whether ibuprofen use in patients with COVID-19 was associated with more severe disease, compared to patients using paracetamol or no antipyretics. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 from Shamir Medical Center, Israel, we monitored any use of ibuprofen from a week prior to diagnosis of COVID-19 throughout the disease. Primary outcomes were mortality and the need for respiratory support, including oxygen administration and mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: The study included 403 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with a median age of 45 years. Of the entire cohort, 44 patients (11%) needed respiratory support and 12 (3%) patients died. One hundred and seventy-nine (44%) patients had fever, with 32% using paracetamol and 22% using ibuprofen, for symptom-relief. In the Ibuprofen group, 3 (3.4%) patients died, while in the non-Ibuprofen group 9 (2.8%) patients died (P=0.95). Nine (10.3%) patients from the Ibuprofen group needed respiratory support, as compared with 35 (11%) from the non-Ibuprofen group (P=1). When compared to exclusive paracetamol users, no differences were observed in mortality rates or the need for respiratory support among patients using ibuprofen. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of COVID-19 patients, Ibuprofen use was not associated with worse clinical outcomes, compared to paracetamol or no antipyretic.","Rinott, Ehud; Kozer, Eran; Shapira, Yonatan; Bar-Haim, Adina; Youngster, Ilan",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.06.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X20303438?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X20303438; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32535147/,571
