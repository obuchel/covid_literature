29,29,29,Towards standardization of RNA quality assessment using user-independent classifiers of microcapillary electrophoresis traces,8.848731,5.843941,2005-03-30,"While it is universally accepted that intact RNA constitutes the best representation of the steady-state of transcription, there is no gold standard to define RNA quality prior to gene expression analysis. In this report, we evaluated the reliability of conventional methods for RNA quality assessment including UV spectroscopy and 28S:18S area ratios, and demonstrated their inconsistency. We then used two new freely available classifiers, the Degradometer and RIN systems, to produce user-independent RNA quality metrics, based on analysis of microcapillary electrophoresis traces. Both provided highly informative and valuable data and the results were found highly correlated, while the RIN system gave more reliable data. The relevance of the RNA quality metrics for assessment of gene expression differences was tested by Q-PCR, revealing a significant decline of the relative expression of genes in RNA samples of disparate quality, while samples of similar, even poor integrity were found highly comparable. We discuss the consequences of these observations to minimize artifactual detection of false positive and negative differential expression due to RNA integrity differences, and propose a scheme for the development of a standard operational procedure, with optional registration of RNA integrity metrics in public repositories of gene expression data.","Imbeaud, Sandrine; Graudens, Esther; Boulanger, Virginie; Barlet, Xavier; Zaborski, Patrick; Eveno, Eric; Mueller, Odilo; Schroeder, Andreas; Auffray, Charles",Nucleic Acids Res,25,1
157,157,157,Apoptotic signals induce specific degradation of ribosomal RNA in yeast,8.828407,5.7530937,2008-04-01,"Organisms exposed to reactive oxygen species, generated endogenously during respiration or by environmental conditions, undergo oxidative stress. Stress response can either repair the damage or activate one of the programmed cell death (PCD) mechanisms, for example apoptosis, and finally end in cell death. One striking characteristic, which accompanies apoptosis in both vertebrates and yeast, is a fragmentation of cellular DNA and mammalian apoptosis is often associated with degradation of different RNAs. We show that in yeast exposed to stimuli known to induce apoptosis, such as hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, hyperosmotic stress and ageing, two large subunit ribosomal RNAs, 25S and 5.8S, became extensively degraded with accumulation of specific intermediates that differ slightly depending on cell death conditions. This process is most likely endonucleolytic, is correlated with stress response, and depends on the mitochondrial respiratory status: rRNA is less susceptible to degradation in respiring cells with functional defence against oxidative stress. In addition, RNA fragmentation is independent of two yeast apoptotic factors, metacaspase Yca1 and apoptosis-inducing factor Aif1, but it relies on the apoptotic chromatin condensation induced by histone H2B modifications. These data describe a novel phenotype for certain stress- and ageing-related PCD pathways in yeast.","Mroczek, Seweryn; Kufel, Joanna",Nucleic Acids Res,25,1
361,361,361,An intermolecular RNA triplex provides insight into structural determinants for the pseudoknot stimulator of −1 ribosomal frameshifting,8.788248,5.6994557,2009-12-08,"An efficient −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) signal requires an RNA slippery sequence and a downstream RNA stimulator, and the hairpin-type pseudoknot is the most common stimulator. However, a pseudoknot is not sufficient to promote −1 PRF. hTPK-DU177, a pseudoknot derived from human telomerase RNA, shares structural similarities with several −1 PRF pseudoknots and is used to dissect the roles of distinct structural features in the stimulator of −1 PRF. Structure-based mutagenesis on hTPK-DU177 reveals that the −1 PRF efficiency of this stimulator can be modulated by sequential removal of base–triple interactions surrounding the helical junction. Further analysis of the junction-flanking base triples indicates that specific stem–loop interactions and their relative positions to the helical junction play crucial roles for the −1 PRF activity of this pseudoknot. Intriguingly, a bimolecular pseudoknot approach based on hTPK-DU177 reveals that continuing triplex structure spanning the helical junction, lacking one of the loop-closure features embedded in pseudoknot topology, can stimulate −1 PRF. Therefore, the triplex structure is an essential determinant for the DU177 pseudoknot to stimulate −1 PRF. Furthermore, it suggests that −1 PRF, induced by an in-trans RNA via specific base–triple interactions with messenger RNAs, can be a plausible regulatory function for non-coding RNAs.","Chou, Ming-Yuan; Chang, Kung-Yao",Nucleic Acids Res,25,1
389,389,389,Large-scale evolutionary surveillance of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus using resequencing arrays,8.911798,6.010446,2010-02-25,"In April 2009, a new influenza A (H1N1 2009) virus emerged that rapidly spread around the world. While current variants of this virus have caused widespread disease, particularly in vulnerable groups, there remains the possibility that future variants may cause increased virulence, drug resistance or vaccine escape. Early detection of these virus variants may offer the chance for increased containment and potentially prevention of the virus spread. We have developed and field-tested a resequencing kit that is capable of interrogating all eight segments of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) virus genome and its variants, with added focus on critical regions such as drug-binding sites, structural components and mutation hotspots. The accompanying base-calling software (EvolSTAR) introduces novel methods that utilize neighbourhood hybridization intensity profiles and substitution bias of probes on the microarray for mutation confirmation and recovery of ambiguous base queries. Our results demonstrate that EvolSTAR is highly accurate and has a much improved call rate. The high throughput and short turn-around time from sample to sequence and analysis results (30 h for 24 samples) makes this kit an efficient large-scale evolutionary biosurveillance tool.","Lee, Charlie Wah Heng; Koh, Chee Wee; Chan, Yang Sun; Aw, Pauline Poh Kim; Loh, Kuan Hon; Han, Bing Ling; Thien, Pei Ling; Nai, Geraldine Yi Wen; Hibberd, Martin L.; Wong, Christopher W.; Sung, Wing-Kin",Nucleic Acids Res,25,28
613,613,613,Stimulation of stop codon readthrough: frequent presence of an extended 3′ RNA structural element,8.786787,5.714125,2011-04-27,"In Sindbis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis and related alphaviruses, the polymerase is translated as a fusion with other non-structural proteins via readthrough of a UGA stop codon. Surprisingly, earlier work reported that the signal for efficient readthrough comprises a single cytidine residue 3′-adjacent to the UGA. However, analysis of variability at synonymous sites revealed strikingly enhanced conservation within the ∼150 nt 3′-adjacent to the UGA, and RNA folding algorithms revealed the potential for a phylogenetically conserved stem–loop structure in the same region. Mutational analysis of the predicted structure demonstrated that the stem–loop increases readthrough by up to 10-fold. The same computational analysis indicated that similar RNA structures are likely to be relevant to readthrough in certain plant virus genera, notably Furovirus, Pomovirus, Tobravirus, Pecluvirus and Benyvirus, as well as the Drosophilia gene kelch. These results suggest that 3′ RNA stimulatory structures feature in a much larger proportion of readthrough cases than previously anticipated, and provide a new criterion for assessing the large number of cellular readthrough candidates that are currently being revealed by comparative sequence analysis.","Firth, Andrew E.; Wills, Norma M.; Gesteland, Raymond F.; Atkins, John F.",Nucleic Acids Res,25,1
710,710,710,mRNA pseudoknot structures can act as ribosomal roadblocks,8.905862,5.797696,2011-09-08,"Several viruses utilize programmed ribosomal frameshifting mediated by mRNA pseudoknots in combination with a slippery sequence to produce a well defined stochiometric ratio of the upstream encoded to the downstream-encoded protein. A correlation between the mechanical strength of mRNA pseudoknots and frameshifting efficiency has previously been found; however, the physical mechanism behind frameshifting still remains to be fully understood. In this study, we utilized synthetic sequences predicted to form mRNA pseudoknot-like structures. Surprisingly, the structures predicted to be strongest lead only to limited frameshifting. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of pulse labelled proteins revealed that a significant fraction of the ribosomes were frameshifted but unable to pass the pseudoknot-like structures. Hence, pseudoknots can act as ribosomal roadblocks, prohibiting a significant fraction of the frameshifted ribosomes from reaching the downstream stop codon. The stronger the pseudoknot the larger the frameshifting efficiency and the larger its roadblocking effect. The maximal amount of full-length frameshifted product is produced from a structure where those two effects are balanced. Taking ribosomal roadblocking into account is a prerequisite for formulating correct frameshifting hypotheses.","Tholstrup, Jesper; Oddershede, Lene B.; Sørensen, Michael A.",Nucleic Acids Res,25,1
1420,1420,1420,RNase L restricts the mobility of engineered retrotransposons in cultured human cells,8.877406,5.7323136,2013-12-25,"Retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements, and their mobility can lead to genomic instability. Retrotransposon insertions are associated with a diverse range of sporadic diseases, including cancer. Thus, it is not a surprise that multiple host defense mechanisms suppress retrotransposition. The 2′,5′-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase (OAS)-RNase L system is a mechanism for restricting viral infections during the interferon antiviral response. Here, we investigated a potential role for the OAS-RNase L system in the restriction of retrotransposons. Expression of wild type (WT) and a constitutively active form of RNase L (NΔ385), but not a catalytically inactive RNase L mutant (R667A), impaired the mobility of engineered human LINE-1 (L1) and mouse intracisternal A-type particle retrotransposons in cultured human cells. Furthermore, WT RNase L, but not an inactive RNase L mutant (R667A), reduced L1 RNA levels and subsequent expression of the L1-encoded proteins (ORF1p and ORF2p). Consistently, confocal immunofluorescent microscopy demonstrated that WT RNase L, but not RNase L R667A, prevented formation of L1 cytoplasmic foci. Finally, siRNA-mediated depletion of endogenous RNase L in a human ovarian cancer cell line (Hey1b) increased the levels of L1 retrotransposition by ∼2-fold. Together, these data suggest that RNase L might function as a suppressor of structurally distinct retrotransposons.","Zhang, Ao; Dong, Beihua; Doucet, Aurélien J.; Moldovan, John B.; Moran, John V.; Silverman, Robert H.",Nucleic Acids Res,25,11
1633,1633,1633,Mapping overlapping functional elements embedded within the protein-coding regions of RNA viruses,8.8749,6.0217505,2014-11-10,"Identification of the full complement of genes and other functional elements in any virus is crucial to fully understand its molecular biology and guide the development of effective control strategies. RNA viruses have compact multifunctional genomes that frequently contain overlapping genes and non-coding functional elements embedded within protein-coding sequences. Overlapping features often escape detection because it can be difficult to disentangle the multiple roles of the constituent nucleotides via mutational analyses, while high-throughput experimental techniques are often unable to distinguish functional elements from incidental features. However, RNA viruses evolve very rapidly so that, even within a single species, substitutions rapidly accumulate at neutral or near-neutral sites providing great potential for comparative genomics to distinguish the signature of purifying selection. Computationally identified features can then be efficiently targeted for experimental analysis. Here we analyze alignments of protein-coding virus sequences to identify regions where there is a statistically significant reduction in the degree of variability at synonymous sites, a characteristic signature of overlapping functional elements. Having previously tested this technique by experimental verification of discoveries in selected viruses, we now analyze sequence alignments for ∼700 RNA virus species to identify hundreds of such regions, many of which have not been previously described.","Firth, Andrew E.",Nucleic Acids Res,25,1
1640,1640,1640,RAN translation and frameshifting as translational challenges at simple repeats of human neurodegenerative disorders,8.68759,5.716691,2014-10-29,"Repeat-associated disorders caused by expansions of short sequences have been classified as coding and noncoding and are thought to be caused by protein gain-of-function and RNA gain-of-function mechanisms, respectively. The boundary between such classifications has recently been blurred by the discovery of repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation reported in spinocerebellar ataxia type 8, myotonic dystrophy type 1, fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome and C9ORF72 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. This noncanonical translation requires no AUG start codon and can initiate in multiple frames of CAG, CGG and GGGGCC repeats of the sense and antisense strands of disease-relevant transcripts. RNA structures formed by the repeats have been suggested as possible triggers; however, the precise mechanism of the translation initiation remains elusive. Templates containing expansions of microsatellites have also been shown to challenge translation elongation, as frameshifting has been recognized across CAG repeats in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 and Huntington's disease. Determining the critical requirements for RAN translation and frameshifting is essential to decipher the mechanisms that govern these processes. The contribution of unusual translation products to pathogenesis needs to be better understood. In this review, we present current knowledge regarding RAN translation and frameshifting and discuss the proposed mechanisms of translational challenges imposed by simple repeat expansions.","Wojciechowska, Marzena; Olejniczak, Marta; Galka-Marciniak, Paulina; Jazurek, Magdalena; Krzyzosiak, Wlodzimierz J.",Nucleic Acids Res,25,11
1713,1713,1713,RPI-Pred: predicting ncRNA-protein interaction using sequence and structural information,8.924557,5.938347,2015-02-18,"RNA-protein complexes are essential in mediating important fundamental cellular processes, such as transport and localization. In particular, ncRNA-protein interactions play an important role in post-transcriptional gene regulation like mRNA localization, mRNA stabilization, poly-adenylation, splicing and translation. The experimental methods to solve RNA-protein interaction prediction problem remain expensive and time-consuming. Here, we present the RPI-Pred (RNA-protein interaction predictor), a new support-vector machine-based method, to predict protein-RNA interaction pairs, based on both the sequences and structures. The results show that RPI-Pred can correctly predict RNA-protein interaction pairs with ∼94% prediction accuracy when using sequence and experimentally determined protein and RNA structures, and with ∼83% when using sequences and predicted protein and RNA structures. Further, our proposed method RPI-Pred was superior to other existing ones by predicting more experimentally validated ncRNA-protein interaction pairs from different organisms. Motivated by the improved performance of RPI-Pred, we further applied our method for reliable construction of ncRNA-protein interaction networks.

Twenty-four hour PM(2.5) filter samples were collected from 23 December 2011 to 31 January 2012 at four sites in the types of traffic, residential, campus, and a near-city rural village, respectively. Daily PM(2.5) concentrations ranged from 49 to 466 µg m(−3), with an arithmetic average of 143 µg m(−3). Laboratory analyses showed that among all measured chemical species, mineral dust contributed the largest proportion (20.7%) to the total PM(2.5) mass, followed by secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA, including SO(4)(2−), NO(3)(−) and NH(4)(+)), which constituted 18.8% of PM(2.5) mass. Another notable feature of PM(2.5) chemical composition was high halogen (Cl(−) and F(−)) loadings at all sites, which was likely due to emissions from coal combustion, plastic manufacturing, and glass melting. Among the four sampling sites, the suburban site exhibited the highest PM(2.5) levels and extremely high Cl(−) and F(−) loadings due to residential wood burning and nearby industrial facilities lacking effective emission controls. Our results report one of the earliest observations of PM(2.5) composition in this region, providing a baseline of aerosol profiles of aerosol before PM(2.5) was routinely measured by environmental protection agencies in China, which could be useful for assessing long-term trends of air quality and effectiveness of mitigation measures.","Zhang, Shichun; Tong, Daniel Q.; Dan, Mo; Pang, Xiaobing; Chen, Weiwei; Zhang, Xuelei; Zhao, Hongmei; Wang, Yiyong; Shang, Bingnan",Int J Environ Res Public Health,25,1
17544,17544,17544,Micro- and Nanosized Substances Cause Different Autophagy-Related Responses,8.857194,6.029673,2021-04-30,"Periodontitis is considered a promoter of many systemic diseases, but the signaling pathways of this interconnection remain elusive. Recently, it became evident that certain microbial challenges promote a heightened response of myeloid cell populations to subsequent infections either with the same or other pathogens. This phenomenon involves changes in the cell epigenetic and transcription, and is referred to as ‘‘trained immunity’’. It acts via modulation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). A main modulation driver is the sustained, persistent low-level transmission of lipopolysaccharide from the periodontal pocket into the peripheral blood. Subsequently, the neutrophil phenotype changes and neutrophils become hyper-responsive and prone to boosted formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET). Cytotoxic neutrophil proteases and histones are responsible for ulcer formations on the pocket epithelium, which foster bacteremia and endoxemia. The latter promote systemic low-grade inflammation (SLGI), a precondition for many systemic diseases and some of them, e.g., atherosclerosis, diabetes etc., can be triggered by SLGI alone. Either reverting the polarized neutrophils back to the homeostatic state or attenuation of neutrophil hyper-responsiveness in periodontitis might be an approach to diminish or even to prevent systemic diseases.","Vitkov, Ljubomir; Muñoz, Luis E.; Knopf, Jasmin; Schauer, Christine; Oberthaler, Hannah; Minnich, Bernd; Hannig, Matthias; Herrmann, Martin",Int J Mol Sci,25,1

We are reporting on the second year of the Pragmatic Assessment of Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness in the DoD (PAIVED), comparing three FDA-licensed influenza vaccine types (egg-based, cell -based, and recombinant) to assess differences in immunogenicity and effectiveness. METHODS: Participants in the second year of PAIVED were enrolled from Oct 2019 through Jan 2020 at 9 military facilities. Participants received weekly inquiries about influenza-like-illnesses (ILI) experienced in the past week, and if the participant reported having a cough or sore throat and a) muscle/body aches or fatigue and/or b) being feverish or having chills, they were scheduled for a clinic visit. During this visit, a blood sample and a nasal swab were collected, as well as information about symptom duration and severity. A second (convalescent) visit was conducted approximately 4 weeks later, which involved collecting additional information about the duration of symptoms and illness burden, as well as a second blood draw. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, acute and convalescent visits were disrupted at most sites in March and April due to COVID-19 precautions. RESULTS: PAIVED year 2 enrolled 5,892 participants who completed demographic forms (Table 1). Among those who reported any ILIs, most reported one ILI (1,345), while 264 reported two ILIs, and 42 reported three ILIs. Nasal swabs were processed from 273 ILIs at four sites (Fig 1), and 14 cases of influenza were identified thus far.

The pandemic situation is declared. This study aimed to evaluate the role of biomarkers in estimating the severity and predicting the prognosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 116 confirmed patients were included in this study. The patients were evaluated clinically. The disease severity was assessed. The measured and calculated laboratory tests were done. The primary outcome is the 30-day mortality. Patients were assigned to the severe (14.7%) and non-severe (85.3%) groups. At IL-6 level of 32.3 pg/mL (the highest Youden’s index = 0.77), IL-6 can differentiate severe from non-severe patients with 82.4% sensitivity and 94.4% specificity. IL-6 can predict the severity [odds ratio of 87.7 (95% CI = 18.9-408.2) (P < 0.0001)]. After adjustment to the significant clinical and laboratory parameters, IL-6 had an adjusted odds ratio of 30.8 (95% CI = 1.1-728.3) (P = 0.046). A high CRP/albumin ratio of > 11.4 was associated with COVID-19 mortality [hazard ratio = 59.9 (95% CI = 7.4–488.3) (P < 0.0001)]. High CRP/albumin ratio had an adjusted hazard ratio of 26.5 (95% CI = 2.6-270.7) after adjustment of age and presence of co-morbidities (P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: IL-6 level could effectively discriminate COVID-19 severity. CRP/albumin ratio was an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality rate in patients with COVID-19. IL-6 and CRP/albumin ratio seem to be valuable biomarkers in evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19, respectively.","El-Shabrawy, Mohamed; Alsadik, Maha E.; El-Shafei, Maher; Abdelmoaty, Ahmed A.; Alazzouni, Ahmed S.; Esawy, Marwa M.; Shabana, Marwa A.",Egypt J Bronchol,25,1

The aim of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of safinamide on NMS burden in PD. SAFINONMOTOR (an open-label study of the effectiveness of safinamide on non-motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease patients) is a prospective open-label single-arm study conducted in five centers from Spain. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline (V1) to the end of the observational period (6 months) (V4) in the non-motor symptoms scale (NMSS) total score. Between May/2019 and February/2020 50 patients were included (age 68.5 ± 9.12 years; 58% females; 6.4 ± 5.1 years from diagnosis). At 6 months, 44 patients completed the follow-up (88%). The NMSS total score was reduced by 38.5% (from 97.5 ± 43.7 in V1 to 59.9 ± 35.5 in V4; p < 0.0001). By domains, improvement was observed in sleep/fatigue (−35.8%; p = 0.002), mood/apathy (−57.9%; p < 0.0001), attention/memory (−23.9%; p = 0.026), gastrointestinal symptoms (−33%; p = 0.010), urinary symptoms (−28.3%; p = 0.003), and pain/miscellaneous (−43%; p < 0.0001).

The omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) readily undergo lipid peroxidation and conversion to malondialdehyde (MDA). MDA-modified low-density lipoprotein (MDA-LDL) is a marker of lipid peroxidation. However, the association between PUFAs and MDA-LDL in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is unclear. Materials and methods We studied the association between PUFAs and MDA-LDL in 16 individuals with ASD (mean age: 11.5 ± 5.7 years) and seven age- and sex-matched healthy controls (mean age: 10.0 ± 4.1 years). The Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) was used to assess behavioral symptoms. We overcame the small sample size by using the adaptive LASSO for enhancing the accuracy of prediction and interpretability. We also estimated the coefficient of variation for an appropriate variable selection and compared additional prior studies to support the findings. Thus, we conducted a careful selection of appropriate candidates to account for confounding variables. Results The ASD group had significantly higher plasma MDA levels, eicosapentaenoic acid levels, and a higher ratio of plasma docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)/arachidonic acid (ARA) levels than the control group. Plasma levels of the omega-6 PUFA fraction, dihomo-γ-linolenic acid, and superoxide dismutase levels were significantly lower in the ASD group than in the control group. Total ABC scores were significantly higher in the ASD group than in the control group. Multiple linear regression and adaptive LASSO indicated that plasma DHA levels and plasma DHA/ARA ratios were significantly associated with total ABC scores and plasma levels of MDA-LDL. Conclusion Increased plasma levels of DHA and DHA/ARA ratio might be related to organic pollution. These neurobiological bases may induce neuronal deficiency associated with autistic behavioral symptoms in individuals with ASD.","Yui, Kunio; Imataka, George; Sasaki, Hitomi; Shiroki, Ryoichi; Koshiba, Mamiko",,25,0

Cancer patients and survivors may be disproportionately affected by these changes, including decreased access to healthcare, increased infection risk, and economic challenges. We sought to determine the effects of the pandemic on thyroid cancer survivors’ quality of life. Methods: An anonymous web-based survey was administered in collaboration with ThyCa: Thyroid Cancer Survivors’ Association, consisting of questions about (1) demographics, (2) thyroid cancer clinical characteristics, (3) attitudes toward and impact of COVID-19, and (4) the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 29-item profile. The survey was linked on the ThyCa homepage. PROMIS measures were scored using item response theory models with a T-score metric relative to U.S. reference data via the HealthMeasures Scoring Service (https://www.healthmeasures.net). T-scores were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon signed-rank, Kruskal-Wallis, and Spearman’s rank correlation tests. Results: From 5/6/2020 - 10/8/2020, 505 participants accessed the survey, and all completed surveys by U.S.-based thyroid cancer survivors were analyzed (n=378, 75%). Mean age was 53 years, 89% were female, 90% were white, 74% had papillary thyroid cancer, 97% had surgery, and 70% received radioactive iodine. The vast majority agreed or strongly agreed (83%) that their lives were very different during COVID-19, as was the way they interacted with their doctors (79%). Less than half (43%) agreed or strongly agreed that they were satisfied with the amount of information from their doctor’s office regarding COVID-19 changes. Compared to previously-published PROMIS data for this population, T-scores were significantly higher in the domain of anxiety/fear (57.8 vs. 56.5, p<0.01) and lower for ability to participate in social roles and activities (46.2 vs. 48.1, p<0.01). Younger age was weakly correlated with greater anxiety/fear (Spearman’s rho=-0.38, p<0.01), and greater anxiety/fear was associated with pending treatment (p<0.01), lower cancer stage (p=0.01), and female sex (p=0.02). Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, thyroid cancer survivors reported increased anxiety/fear and decreased social participation. In our efforts to care for patients both physically and mentally as the pandemic continues, we must better understand their fears and concerns and improve communication about potential changes to their care.","Graves, Claire E; Goyal, Neha; Levin, Anna; Nuno, Miriam A; Kim, Jina; Campbell, Michael J; Shen, Wen T; Gosnell, Jessica Erin; Roman, Sanziana; Sosa, Julie Ann; Duh, Quan-Yang; Suh, Insoo",J Endocr Soc,25,0

High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) has become an initial valuable tool for screening, diagnosis, and assessment of disease severity. This study aimed to assess the clinical, radiographic, and laboratory findings of COVID-19 with HRCT follow-up in discharged patients to predict lung fibrosis after COVID-19 infection in survived patients. RESULTS: This study included two-hundred and ten patients who were tested positive for the novel coronavirus by nasopharyngeal swap, admitted to the hospital, and discharged after recovery. Patients with at least a one-time chest CT scan after discharge were enrolled. According to the presence of fibrosis on follow-up CT after discharge, patients were classified into two groups and assigned as the “non-fibrotic group” (without evident fibrosis) and “fibrotic group” (with evident fibrosis). We compared between these two groups based on the recorded clinical data, patient demographic information (i.e., sex and age), length of stay (LOS) in the hospital, admission to the ICU, laboratory results (peak C-reactive protein [CRP] level, lowest lymphocyte level, serum ferritin, high-sensitivity troponin, d-dimer, administration of steroid), and CT features (CT severity score and CT consolidation/crazy-paving score). CT score includes the CT during the hospital stay with peak opacification and follow-up CT after discharge. The average CT follow-up time after discharge is 41.5 days (range, 20 to 65 days). There was a statistically significant difference between both groups (p ˂0.001). Further, a multivariate analysis was performed and found that the age of the patients, initial CT severity score, consolidation/crazy-paving score, and ICU admission were independent risk factors associated with the presence of post-COVID-19 fibrosis (p<0.05). Chest CT severity score shows a sensitivity of 86.1%, a specificity of 78%, and an accuracy of 81.9% at a cutoff point of 10.5. CONCLUSION: The residual pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19 survivors after discharge depends on many factors with the patient’s age, CT severity, consolidation/crazy-paving scores, and ICU admission as independent risk factors associated with the presence of post-COVID-19 fibrosis.","Yasin, Rabab; Gomaa, Ahmed Abdelhakim Kamel; Ghazy, Tamer; Hassanein, Shaimaa Abdelhamid; Ibrahem, Reda Abdel latif; Khalifa, Mohamed Hossameldin",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,25,16

Remote monitoring and telemedicine played a significant role in this shift. We anticipate these changes to continue in the future with internet-connected wearables (ICWs) playing an important role in measuring and managing sleep remotely. As these ICWs measures a small subset of signals traditionally measured during polysomnography (PSG), manual sleep staging becomes non-trivial and sometimes impossible. The ability to do accurate and reliable automatic sleep staging using different modalities of physiological signals remotely is becoming ever more important. METHODS: The current work seeks to quantify the sleep staging performance of Z3Score-Neo (https://z3score.com, Neurobit Technologies, Singapore), a signal agnostic, cloud-based real-time sleep analytics platform. We tested its staging performance on the CINC open dataset with N=994 subjects using various combinations of signals including Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrooculogram (EOG), Electromyogram (EMG), and Instantaneous Heart Rate (IHR) derived from Electrocardiogram (ECG). The staging was compared against manual scoring based on PSG. For IHR based staging, N1 and N2 were combined. RESULTS: We achieved substantial agreement (all Cohen’s Kappa > 0.7) between automatic and manual staging using various combinations of EEG, EOG and EMG channels with accuracies varying between 81.76% (two central EEGs, one EOG, one EMG), 79.31% (EEG+EOG), 78.73% (EEG only) and 78.09% (one EOG). We achieved moderate agreement (accuracy: 72.8% κ=0.54) with IHR derived from ECG. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated the accuracy of a cloud-based sleep analytics platform on an open dataset, using various combinations of ecologically valid physiological signals. EOG and EMG channels can be easily self-administered using sticker-based electrodes and can be added to existing home sleep apnea test (HSAT) kits significantly improving their utility. ICWs are already capable of accurately measuring EEG/EOG (Muse, InteraXon Inc., Toronto, Canada; Dreem band, Dreem, USA) and IHR derived from ECG (Movesense, Suunto, Finland) or photoplethysmogram (Oura Ring, Oura Health Oy, Finland) or through non-contact ballistocardiogram/radio-based measurements (Dozee, Turtle Shell Technologies, India; Sleepiz, Sleepiz AG, Switzerland). Therefore, a well-validated cloud-based staging platform solves a major technological hurdle towards the proliferation of remote monitoring and telehealth in sleep medicine.

PHE and RCS advised non-operative management wherever possible, changing management of acute gallstone disease from early laparoscopic cholecystectomy to conservative treatment and frequent percutaneous drainage. Planning, prioritisation, and implementation of “COVID-Safe” pathways presented multi-factorial challenges throughout the NHS. METHOD: Prospective data of patients admitted with acute gallstone pathology was collected at Chelsea & Westminster Hospital (23/03/2020-16/08/2020), and prioritised using Tokyo, FSSA and RCS Guidance. A restructured “Gallbladder-pathway” was implemented comprising trust-wide referral proforma, weekly clinical planning MDT meetings and dedicated theatre lists. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were prioritized as either “Urgent” (25), “Expedited” (12) or “Elective” (31); comprising gallstone pancreatitis (11), acute cholecystitis (53), obstructive jaundice (12) and biliary colic (8). 12 patients required cholecystostomies. During the “Peak” (23/3/20-02/06/2020) no cholecystectomies were performed, 10 in “Recovery” (02/06/20-06/07/20) in NCEPOD theatre, 21 in “Resolution” (06/07/20-18/08/20) since implementation of the “Gallbladder-Pathway”. Eleven patients (16%) re-presented while awaiting definitive treatment, none critically ill. The highest number of re-presentations was in “Urgent” patients (36%) and those with cholecystostomy (45%).

To understand this positive correlation, we simulated the transfer of these genes and bacterial pathogens in a community of interacting people that take antibiotics when infected by pathogens. Simulations show that people with higher diversity of virulence and resistance genes took antibiotics long ago, not recently. On the other extreme, we find people with low diversity of both gene types because they took antibiotics recently—while antibiotics select specific resistance genes, they also decrease gene diversity by eliminating bacteria. In general, the diversity of virulence and resistance genes becomes positively correlated whenever the transmission probability between people is higher than the probability of losing resistance genes. The positive correlation holds even under changes of several variables, such as the relative or total diversity of virulence and resistance genes, the contamination probability between individuals, the loss rate of resistance genes, or the social network type. Because the loss rate of resistance genes may be shallow, we conclude that the transmission between people and antibiotic usage are the leading causes for the positive correlation between virulence and antibiotic-resistance genes.","Domingues, Célia P.

We recently reported that apelin inhibits BK(Ca) channel function in cerebral arteries, resulting in impaired endothelium-dependent relaxations. In contrast, apelin causes endothelium-dependent relaxation of coronary arteries. However, the effects of apelin on BK(Ca) channel function in coronary arterial myocytes have not yet been explored. We hypothesized that apelin-APJ receptor signaling does not have an inhibitory effect on coronary arterial BK(Ca) channels and hence does not alter nitric oxide (NO)-dependent relaxation of coronary arteries. Patch clamp recording was used to measure whole cell K(+) currents in freshly isolated coronary smooth muscle cells. Apelin had no effect on the increases in current density in response to membrane depolarization or to NS1619 (a BK(Ca) channel opener). Moreover, apelin did not inhibit NO/cGMP-dependent relaxations that required activation of BK(Ca) channels in isolated coronary arteries. Apelin-APJ receptor signaling caused a marked increase in intracellular Ca(2+) levels in coronary arterial smooth muscle cells, but failed to activate PI3-kinase to increase phosphorylation of Akt protein. Collectively, these data provide mechanistic evidence that apelin has no inhibitory effects on BK(Ca) channel function in coronary arteries. The lack of inhibitory effect on BK(Ca) channels makes it unlikely that activation of APJ receptors in coronary arteries would adversely affect coronary flow by creating a vasoconstrictive environment. It can be expected that apelin or other APJ receptor agonists in development will not interfere with the vasodilator effects of endogenous BK(Ca) channel openers.","Mughal, Amreen; Sun, Chengwen; O’Rourke, Stephen T.",Front Pharmacol,25,0

Recently, a new series of amide derivatives as non-covalent inhibitors of the β1i subunit with K(i) values in the low/submicromolar ranges have been identified. Here, we investigated the binding mechanism of the most potent and selective inhibitor, N-benzyl-2-(2-oxopyridin-1(2H)-yl)propanamide (1), to elucidate the steps from the ligand entrance into the binding pocket to the ligand-induced conformational changes. We carried out a total of 400 ns of MD-binding analyses, followed by 200 ns of plain MD. The trajectories clustering allowed identifying three representative poses evidencing new key interactions with Phe31 and Lys33 together in a flipped orientation of a representative pose. Further, Binding Pose MetaDynamics (BPMD) studies were performed to evaluate the binding stability, comparing 1 with four other inhibitors of the β1i subunit: N-benzyl-2-(2-oxopyridin-1(2H)-yl)acetamide (2), N-cyclohexyl-3-(2-oxopyridin-1(2H)-yl)propenamide (3), N-butyl-3-(2-oxopyridin-1(2H)-yl)propanamide (4), and (S)-2-(2-oxopyridin-1(2H)-yl)-N,4-diphenylbutanamide (5).

Civil society responses pointed to the pressure that it was under in the absence of adequate outreach by the state for meeting food, livelihood, and other insecurities of urban and rural populations. Against this backdrop, the article outlines some of the challenges facing Social Work and Community Development in addressing poverty and marginalization. An examination of the relationship between Social Work with the state, and the contemporary complex neoliberal context for practice, highlights classroom-field tensions in community organization (CD). In preparing graduates for what appears to be a messy field, an orderly curriculum, irrespective of how well thought out it may be, struggles to retain convergence between principles of CD and certain elements of contemporary practice. It emerges that education for CD needs to build systematically on critical community practice and align with an anti- oppressive framework, in order to contribute substantively to addressing poverty and marginalization.","Vyas, Mouleshri",Community Dev J,25,1

The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the association of SDH with child maltreatment. METHODS Five data sources (PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, SCOPUS, JSTORE, and the Social Intervention Research and Evaluation Network Evidence Library) were searched for studies examining the following SDH: poverty, parental educational attainment, housing instability, food insecurity, uninsurance, access to healthcare, and transportation. Studies were selected and coded using the PICOS statement. RESULTS The search identified 3441 studies; 33 were included in the final database. All SDH categories were significantly associated with child maltreatment, except that there were no studies on transportation or healthcare. The greatest number of studies were found for poverty (n = 29), followed by housing instability (13), parental educational attainment (8), food insecurity (1), and uninsurance (1). CONCLUSIONS SDH, including poverty, parental educational attainment, housing instability, food insecurity, and uninsurance, are associated with child maltreatment. These findings suggest an urgent priority should be routinely screening families for SDH, with referrals to appropriate services, a process that could have the potential to prevent both child maltreatment and subsequent recidivism. IMPACT SDH, including poverty, parental educational attainment, housing instability, food insecurity, and uninsurance, are associated with child maltreatment.No prior published systematic review, to our knowledge, has examined the spectrum of SDH with respect to their associations with child maltreatment.These findings suggest an urgent priority should be routinely screening families for SDH, with referrals to appropriate services, a process that could have the potential to prevent both child maltreatment and subsequent recidivism.","Hunter, Amy A; Flores, Glenn",Pediatric research,25,16

Although still much less utilized compared to computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is gaining traction in medical 3D printing. The purpose of this study was two-fold: 1) to determine the prevalence in the existing literature of using MRI to create 3D printed anatomic models for surgical planning and 2) to provide image acquisition recommendations for appropriate clinical scenarios where MRI is the most suitable imaging modality. The workflow for creating 3D printed anatomic models from medical imaging data is complex and involves image segmentation of the regions of interest and conversion of that data into 3D surface meshes, which are compatible with printing technologies. CT is most commonly used to create 3D printed anatomic models due to the high image quality and relative ease of performing image segmentation from CT data. As compared to CT datasets, 3D printing using MRI data offers advantages since it provides exquisite soft tissue contrast needed for accurate organ segmentation and it does not expose patients to unnecessary ionizing radiation. MRI, however, often requires complicated imaging techniques and time-consuming postprocessing procedures to generate high-resolution 3D anatomic models needed for 3D printing. Despite these challenges, 3D modeling and printing from MRI data holds great clinical promises thanks to emerging innovations in both advanced MRI imaging and postprocessing techniques.

AIM The aim of this study was to establish a porcine model of SFSS. METHODS Twenty-four Landrace pigs underwent liver resection with a remnant liver volume of 50% (group A, n = 8), 25% (group B, n = 8), and 15% (group C, n = 8). After resection, the animals were followed up for 8 days and clinical, laboratory, and histopathological outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS The survival rate was significantly lower in group C compared with the other groups (p < 0.001). The international normalized ratio, bilirubin, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase levels increased shortly after surgery in groups B and C, but no change was observed in group A (p < 0.05 for all analyses).

Medication treatment of opioid use disorder (MOUD) is effective, yet barriers to care continue to result in a large proportion of untreated individuals. Optimal analgesia can be obtained in patients with MOUD within the perioperative period. Anesthesiologists and pain physicians can recommend and consider initiating MOUD in patients with suspected OUD at the point of care; this can serve as a bridge to comprehensive treatment and ultimately save lives. METHODS The Board of Directors of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, American Society of Anesthesiologists, American Academy of Pain Medicine, American Society of Addiction Medicine and American Society of Health System Pharmacists approved the creation of a Multisociety Working Group on Opioid Use Disorder, representing the fields of pain medicine, addiction, and pharmacy health sciences. An extensive literature search was performed by members of the working group. Multiple study types were included and reviewed for quality. A modified Delphi process was used to assess the literature and expert opinion for each topic, with 100% consensus being achieved on the statements and each recommendation. The consensus statements were then graded by the committee members using the United States Preventive Services Task Force grading of evidence guidelines. In addition to the consensus recommendations, a narrative overview of buprenorphine, including pharmacology and legal statutes, was performed. RESULTS Two core topics were identified for the development of recommendations with >75% consensus as the goal for consensus; however, the working group achieved 100% consensus on both topics. Specific topics included (1) providing recommendations to aid physicians in the management of patients receiving buprenorphine for MOUD in the perioperative setting and (2) providing recommendations to aid physicians in the initiation of buprenorphine in patients with suspected OUD in the perioperative setting. CONCLUSIONS To decrease the risk of OUD recurrence, buprenorphine should not be routinely discontinued in the perioperative setting. Buprenorphine can be initiated in untreated patients with OUD and acute pain in the perioperative setting to decrease the risk of opioid recurrence and death from overdose.","Kohan, Lynn; Potru, Sudheer; Barreveld, Antje; Sprintz, Michael; Lane, Olabisi; Aryal, Anuj; Emerick, Trent; Dopp, Anna; Chhay, Sophia; Viscusi, Eugene",Regional anesthesia and pain medicine,25,1

We performed a population-based study to evaluate the rate, predictors, and familial risk for synchronous and metachronous CRC in Utah. METHODS All newly diagnosed cases of CRC between 1980 and 2010 were obtained from the Utah Cancer Registry and linked to pedigrees from the Utah Population Database. RESULTS Of the 18,782 patients diagnosed with CRC, 134 were diagnosed with synchronous CRC (0.71%) and 300 were diagnosed with metachronous CRC (1.60%). The risk for synchronous CRC was significantly higher in men (odds ratio [OR], 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-2.06) and in patients aged 65 years or older (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.02-2.21). Synchronous CRCs were located more often in the proximal colon (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.20-2.41). First-degree relatives of cases with synchronous (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.37-2.53), metachronous (OR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.62-3.36), or solitary CRC (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.63-1.88) were at increased risk for developing CRC, compared with relatives of CRC-free individuals. Four percent of first-degree relatives of patients with synchronous or metachronous cancer developed CRC at younger ages than the age recommended for initiating CRC screening (based on familial risk), and therefore would not have been screened. CONCLUSIONS Of patients diagnosed with CRC, 2.3% are found to have synchronous lesions or develop metachronous CRC during follow-up evaluation. Relatives of these patients have a greater risk of CRC than those without a family history of CRC. These results highlight the importance of obtaining a thorough family history and adhering strictly to surveillance guidelines during management of high-risk patients.","Samadder, N Jewel; Curtin, Karen; Wong, Jathine; Tuohy, Thérèse M F; Mineau, Geraldine P; Smith, Ken Robert; Pimentel, Richard; Pappas, Lisa; Boucher, Ken; Garrido-Laguna, Ignacio; Provenzale, Dawn; Burt, Randall W",Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,25,11

Tourism is one of the world’s largest industries, and hence a powerful global political and socio-economic force. Yet numerous problems associated with conventional tourism development have been documented over the years, problems now greatly exacerbated by impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Calls for sustainable tourism development have long sought to address such issues and set the industry on a better course. Yet such calls tend to still promote continued growth as the basis of the tourism industry’s development, while mounting demands for “degrowth” suggest that growth is itself the fundamental problem that needs to be addressed in discussion of sustainability in tourism and elsewhere. This critique asserts that incessant growth is intrinsic to capitalist development, and hence to tourism’s role as one of the main forms of global capitalist expansion. Touristic degrowth would therefore necessitate postcapitalist practices aiming to socialise the tourism industry. While a substantial body of research has explored how tourism functions as an expression of a capitalist political economy, thus far no research has systematically explored what post-capitalist tourism might look like or how to achieve it. Applying Erik Olin Wright’s 2019 innovative typology for conceptualizing different forms of post-capitalism as components of an overarching strategy for “eroding capitalism” to a series of illustrative allows for exploration of their potential to contribute to an analogous strategy to similarly “erode tourism” as a quintessential capitalist industry.

During infection, rotavirus transcripts accumulate in cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein (RNP) condensates, termed viroplasms. Understanding the mechanisms of viroplasm assembly and RNA enrichment within is crucial to gaining greater insight into their function and stoichiometric assortment of individual transcripts. We analysed the subcellular distribution of individual RV transcripts and viroplasm transcriptome by combining multiplexed DNA-barcoded single-molecule RNA FISH of infected cells. Using DNA-PAINT microscopy, we provide evidence of the early onset of viral transcript oligomerisation that occurs prior to the formation of viroplasms. We demonstrate that viral sequences lacking the conserved terminal regions fail to undergo enrichment in rotavirus RNP condensates. We show that individual viral transcripts exhibit variable propensities to partition into viroplasms, irrespective of their absolute numbers in cells, suggesting a selective RNA enrichment mechanism distinct from other known cellular RNP granules. We suggest that rotavirus replication factories represent unique RNP condensates enriched in eleven types of cognate transcripts that may facilitate the assembly of a multi-segmented RNA genome.","Strauss, Sebastian; Borodavka, Alexander; Papa, Guido; Desiró, Daniel; Schueder, Florian; Jungmann, Ralf",bioRxiv,25,9

The World Health Organization is attempting to develop and distribute effective vaccines to prevent/reduce key viral respiratory diseases. METHODS The goals of a vaccination program for viral respiratory infections include the prevention of lower respiratory tract infections and prevention of infection-associated morbidities, hospitalization and mortality. This article explores influenza and RSV vaccine developments. RESULTS There are 2 influenza vaccines, trivalent inactivated and live, cold-adapted, attenuated. Trivalent inactivated vaccine is indicated for persons older than 6 months of age. Currently <10%, <30% and <30% of healthy children, healthy adults and high risk children, respectively, are vaccinated. Efficacy is from 70 to 90% in healthy adults younger than 65 years of age and 30-90% in children, with lower efficacy in younger children. Live, cold-adapted, attenuated vaccine is indicated for healthy persons 5-49 years of age and usually is 70-90% effective. Various RSV vaccine formulations are being investigated. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends influenza vaccination for children 6-23 months old. Studies support immunization of all children, not only those at high risk. Current ACIP recommendations focus on high risk persons and do not include school age children. A universal immunization program for all children could benefit the entire community. CONCLUSION Effective vaccines are available for some viral respiratory pathogens (eg, influenza virus), but not for most mucosally restricted respiratory viral pathogens. Research should continue into safe and effective vaccines for all childhood viral illnesses.","Greenberg, Harry B; Piedra, Pedro A",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,25,1

Human highly pathogenic coronaviruses are composed of non-structural proteins, structural proteins and accessory proteins. Viral particles recognize host receptors via spike glycoprotein (S protein), enter host cells by membrane fusion, replicate in host cells through large replication-transcription complexes, and promote proliferation by interfering with and suppressing the host's immune response. Human highly pathogenic coronaviruses are hosted by humans and vertebrates. Viral particles are transmitted through droplets, contact and aerosols or likely through digestive tract, urine, eyes and other routes.

A 9-nucleotide (nt) sequence (UUUAUAAAC), which is located immediately downstream of the leader at the 5' terminus of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genomic RNA, contains a sequence resembling the consensus intergenic sequence (UCUAAAC). It has been shown previously that the presence of the 9-nt sequence facilitates leader RNA switching and may enhance subgenomic mRNA transcription. It is unclear how the 9-nt sequence exerts these functions. In this study, we inserted the 9-nt sequence into a defective interfering (DI) RNA reporter system and demonstrated that mRNA transcription could be initiated from the 9-nt sequence almost as efficiently as from the intergenic sequence between genes 6 and 7. Sequence analysis of the mRNAs showed that the 9-nt sequence served as a site of fusion between the leaders and mRNA. The transcription initiation function of the 9-nt sequence could not be substituted by other 5'-terminal sequences. When the entire 5'-terminal sequence, including four copies of the UCUAA sequence plus the 9-nt sequence, was present, transcription could be initiated from any of the UCUAA copies or the 9-nt sequence, resulting in different copy numbers of the UCUAA sequence and the deletion of the 9-nt sequence in some mRNAs. All of these heterogeneous RNA species were also detected from the 5'-terminal region of the viral genomic-length RNA in MHV-infected cells. These results thus suggest tha the heterogeneity of the copy number of UCUAA sequences at the 5' end, the deletion of the 9-nt sequence in viral and DI RNAs, and the leader RNA switching are the results of transcriptional initiation from the 9-nt site. They also show that an mRNA species (mRNA 1) that lacks the 9-nt sequence can be synthesized during MHV infection. Therefore, MHV genomic RNA replication and mRNA 1 transcription may be distinguishable.","Zhang, X; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,25,1

The loss to the economy has also been enormous. 13 new countries, including India, reported occurrence of the disease in poultry animals in February 2006 only, to the World Health Organisation. This rapid rate of spread of virus along with notoriety of the virus for frequent genetic re-assortment, which might enable H5N1 to infect human beings, threatens of possible influenza pandemic since the last pandemic in 1968. The human influenza caused by this subtype of the virus (H5N1) has high case fatality of 54% and majority of affected humans are between the age of 5 to 23 years. Lack of effective vaccine, poor knowledge about treatment, and with scarcity of public health measures in developing countries are major causes of concern. The real threat of impending pandemic can be avoided only if we act immediately on the basis of currently available source of information and apply scientific knowledge rationally for containment and prevention of bird flu and treat human cases promptly.","Lahariya, Chandrakant; Sharma, A K; Pradhan, S K",Indian pediatrics,25,9

Both under- and over-inflation of the ETT cuff can lead to patient complications, with an ideal pressure range of 20-30 cmH2O defined. A range of techniques are employed to ensure adequate ETT cuff inflation, with little comparative data. We performed an observational cross-sectional study in a tertiary metropolitan ICU, assessing the relationship between the minimal leak test and cuff manometry. Forty-five mechanically ventilated patients, over a three-month period, had ETT cuff manometry performed at the same time as their routine cuff maintenance (minimal leak test). Bedside nurse measurements were compared with investigator measurements. At the endpoint of cuff inflation, 20 of 45 patients (44%) had cuff pressures between 20 and 30 cmH2O; 11 of 45 patients (24%) had cuff pressures <20 cmH2O; 14 of 45 patients (31%) had cuff pressures ≥30 cmH2O. Univariate analysis demonstrated an association between both patient obesity and female gender requiring less ETT cuff volume (P=0.008 and P <0.001 respectively), though this association was lost on multivariate analysis. No association was demonstrated between any measured variables and cuff pressures. Inter-operator reliability in performing the minimal leak test showed no evidence of bias between nurse and investigators (Pearson coefficient = 0.897). We conclude the minimal leak test for maintenance of ETT cuffs leads to both over- and under-inflation, and alternative techniques, such as cuff manometry, should be employed.","Harvie, D A; Darvall, J N; Dodd, M; De La Cruz, A; Tacey, M; D'Costa, R L; Ward, D",Anaesthesia and intensive care,25,16

The purpose of this review is to provide a resource for CRNAs returning to the ICU to manage patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. The most common ventilator modes found in anesthesia machine ventilators and ICU ventilators are reviewed, as are the lung-protective ventilation strategies, including positive end-expiratory pressure, used to manage patients with COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome. Adjuncts to mechanical ventilation, recruitment maneuvers, prone positioning, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are also reviewed.

Here we demonstrate that incorporation is mediated by the short carboxy-terminal segment comprising the transmembrane and endodomain. To this aim, we used the virus-like particle (VLP) system that we developed earlier for the mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) and which we describe now also for the unrelated coronavirus feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV; strain 79-1146). Two chimeric MHV-FIPV S proteins were constructed, consisting of the ectodomain of the one virus and the transmembrane and endodomain of the other. These proteins were tested for their incorporation into VLPs of either species. They were found to assemble only into viral particles of the species from which their carboxy-terminal domain originated. Thus, the 64-terminal-residue sequence suffices to draw the 1308 (MHV)- or 1433 (FIPV)-amino-acid-long mature S protein into VLPs. Both chimeric S proteins appeared to cause cell fusion when expressed individually, suggesting that they were biologically fully active. This was indeed confirmed by incorporating one of the proteins into virions which thereby acquired a new host cell tropism, as will be reported elsewhere.","Godeke, G J; de Haan, C A; Rossen, J W; Vennema, H; Rottier, P J",Journal of virology,25,33

Hypoxaemia is one of the main clinical manifestations, especially in severe cases. HIF1&#945; is a master transcription factor involved in the cellular response to oxygen levels. The immunopathogenesis of this severe form of COVID-19 is poorly understood. METHODS: We performed scRNAseq from leukocytes from five critically ill COVID-19 patients and characterized the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor1&#945; and its transcriptionally regulated genes. Also performed metanalysis from the publicly available RNAseq data from COVID-19 bronchoalveolar cells. RESULTS: Critically-ill COVID-19 patients show a shift towards an immature myeloid profile in peripheral blood cells, including band neutrophils, immature monocytes, metamyelocytes, monocyte-macrophages, monocytoid precursors, and promyelocytes-myelocytes, together with mature monocytes and segmented neutrophils. May be the result of a physiological response known as emergency myelopoiesis. These cellular subsets and bronchoalveolar cells express HIF1&#945; and their transcriptional targets related to inflammation (CXCL8, CXCR1, CXCR2, and CXCR4); virus sensing, (TLR2 and TLR4); and metabolism (SLC2A3, PFKFB3, PGK1, GAPDH and SOD2). CONCLUSIONS: The up-regulation and participation of HIF1&#945; in events such as inflammation, immunometabolism, and TLR make it a potential molecular marker for COVID-19 severity and, interestingly, could represent a potential target for molecular therapy. Key messages Critically ill COVID-19 patients show emergency myelopoiesis. HIF1&#945; and its transcriptionally regulated genes are expressed in immature myeloid cells which could serve as molecular targets. HIF1&#945; and its transcriptionally regulated genes is also expressed in lung cells from critically ill COVID-19 patients which may partially explain the hypoxia related events.","Taniguchi-Ponciano, Keiko; Vadillo, Eduardo; Mayani, Héctor; Gonzalez-Bonilla, César Raúl; Torres, Javier; Majluf, Abraham; Flores-Padilla, Guillermo; Wacher-Rodarte, Niels; Galan, Juan Carlos; Ferat-Osorio, Eduardo; Blanco-Favela, Francisco; Lopez-Macias, Constantino; Ferreira-Hermosillo, Aldo; Ramirez-Renteria, Claudia; Peña-Martínez, Eduardo; Silva-Román, Gloria; Vela-Patiño, Sandra; Mata-Lozano, Carlos; Carvente-Garcia, Roberto; Basurto-Acevedo, Lourdes; Saucedo, Renata; Piña-Sanchez, Patricia; Chavez-Gonzalez, Antonieta; Marrero-Rodríguez, Daniel; Mercado, Moisés",Ann Med,25,1

However, the impact of the pandemic on telemedicine use at a population level in rural and remote settings remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate changes in the rate of telemedicine use among rural populations and identify patient characteristics associated with telemedicine use prior to and during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a repeated cross-sectional study on all monthly and quarterly rural telemedicine visits from January 2012 to June 2020, using administrative data from Ontario, Canada. We compared the changes in telemedicine use among residents of rural and urban regions of Ontario prior to and during the pandemic. RESULTS: Before the pandemic, telemedicine use was steadily low in 2012-2019 for both rural and urban populations but slightly higher overall for rural patients (11 visits per 1000 patients vs 7 visits per 1000 patients in December 2019, P<.001). The rate of telemedicine visits among rural patients significantly increased to 147 visits per 1000 patients in June 2020. A similar but steeper increase (P=.15) was observed among urban patients (220 visits per 1000 urban patients). Telemedicine use increased across all age groups, with the highest rates reported among older adults aged &#8805;65 years (77 visits per 100 patients in 2020). The proportions of patients with at least 1 telemedicine visit were similar across the adult age groups (n=82,246/290,401, 28.3% for patients aged 18-49 years, n=79,339/290,401, 27.3% for patients aged 50-64 years, and n=80,833/290,401, 27.8% for patients aged 65-79 years), but lower among younger patients <18 years (n=23,699/290,401, 8.2%) and older patients &#8805;80 years (n=24,284/290,401, 8.4%) in 2020 (P<.001). There were more female users than male users of telemedicine (n=158,643/290,401, 54.6% vs n=131,758/290,401, 45.4%, respectively, in 2020; P<.001). There was a significantly higher proportion of telemedicine users residing in relatively less rural than in more rural regions (n=261,814/290,401, 90.2% vs n=28,587/290,401, 9.8%, respectively, in 2020; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine adoption increased in rural and remote areas during the COVID-19 pandemic, but its use increased in urban and less rural populations.

Each group was subdivided into 3 sub-groups of 10 calves as follows: calves fed colostrum supplement at 24 or 48 or 72 h after birth. All calves fed fresh colostrum within 6 h after birth at the amount of 5% of BW by bottle. Calves which were fed lyophilized colostrum supplement had a significant lower incidence of diarrhea in comparison to control calves. In addition, calves were received lyophilized colostrum supplement at 24 h after birth showed less incidence of diarrhea than calves fed the supplement at 48 and 72 h. According to the results of present study providing lyophilized colostrum supplement at 24 h after birth might have been preventive effect on calf diarrhea. The spray-dried colostrum supplement had not the same effect.","Dezfouli, M. R. Mokhber; Rezazadeh, F.; Rabbani, M.; Zahraai, S. T.; Seifi, H. A.",Comp Clin Path,25,16

Recent evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is mediated by the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) for “priming,” which is highly expressed in the pancreas. To our knowledge, there is no other reported case of AP associated with COVID-19 after the respiratory symptoms are resolved. In this article, we present a patient with COVID-19, who came with intractable epigastric pain and resolved respiratory symptoms. A diagnosis of AP complicated with COVID-19 was made after laboratory and imaging workup, which was successfully managed conservatively.","Muhammad Abrar Jeelani, Hafiz; Sheikh, Muhammad Mubbashir; Samuel, Shirly Susan; Omotosho, Yetunde Bernice; Sharko, Artem; Albetar, Rami",J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,25,10

Although the reported incidence of AKI among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 varies widely, AKI among hospitalized patients is associated with poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes in our COVID-19 patients who developed AKI during intensive care unit hospitalization. METHOD: In our retrospective, observational study COVID-19 PCR positive 49 patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 pnumoniae in intensive care unit and developed AKI were evaluated with demographics, laboratory data, treatment and outcome. The prognostic nutritional index (PNI), which is calculated using the serum albumin concentration and total lymphocytic count were also evaluated. All patients were treated with favipiravir+low molecular weight heparin; laboratory tests were recorded before and after favipiravir treatment. RESULTS: Of 49 patients; 28 were male. A total of 9/49 (18.4%) patients survived. All patients were treated with favipiravir; laboratory tests were recorded before and after favipiravir treatment. The clinical parameters of patients are shown in Table-1 and Table-2. Mean PNI of the patients who survived was higher than patients who were exitus. CONCLUSION: AKI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was associated with high mortality. Of all patients with AKI, only 18.4% survived.","Akagun, Tulin; Ayraler, Arzu; Usta, Murat; Baylan, Süleyman; Dulger, Ahmet Cumhur",Nephrol Dial Transplant,25,1

We aimed to establish whether health outcomes and care differed between patients with SCZ and patients without a diagnosis of severe mental illness. We conducted a population-based cohort study of all patients with identified COVID-19 and respiratory symptoms who were hospitalized in France between February and June 2020. Cases were patients who had a diagnosis of SCZ. Controls were patients who did not have a diagnosis of severe mental illness. The outcomes were in-hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. A total of 50 750 patients were included, of whom 823 were SCZ patients (1.6%). The SCZ patients had an increased in-hospital mortality (25.6% vs 21.7%; adjusted OR 1.30 [95% CI, 1.08–1.56], P = .0093) and a decreased ICU admission rate (23.7% vs 28.4%; adjusted OR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.62–0.91], P = .0062) compared with controls. Significant interactions between SCZ and age for mortality and ICU admission were observed (P = .0006 and P < .0001). SCZ patients between 65 and 80 years had a significantly higher risk of death than controls of the same age (+7.89%). SCZ patients younger than 55 years had more ICU admissions (+13.93%) and SCZ patients between 65 and 80 years and older than 80 years had less ICU admissions than controls of the same age (−15.44% and −5.93%, respectively). Our findings report the existence of disparities in health and health care between SCZ patients and patients without a diagnosis of severe mental illness. These disparities differed according to the age and clinical profile of SCZ patients, suggesting the importance of personalized COVID-19 clinical management and health care strategies before, during, and after hospitalization for reducing health disparities in this vulnerable population.","Fond, Guillaume; Pauly, Vanessa; Leone, Marc; Llorca, Pierre-Michel; Orleans, Veronica; Loundou, Anderson; Lancon, Christophe; Auquier, Pascal; Baumstarck, Karine; Boyer, Laurent",Schizophr Bull,25,16

The increasing number of deaths due to this disease was of great concern. Therefore, our study aimed to explore risk factors associated with COVID-19 deaths. After having searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and CNKI for studies published as of August 10, 2020, we selected articles and extracted data. The meta-analysis was performed using Stata 16.0 software. Nineteen studies were used in our meta-analysis. The proportions of comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, malignancies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardio-cerebrovascular disease, and chronic liver disease were statistically significantly higher in mortal COVID-19 cases. Coagulation and inflammatory markers, such as platelet count, D-dimer, prothrombin time, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and interleukin 6, predicted the deterioration of the disease. In addition, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and mechanical ventilation predicted the poor prognosis during its progression. The COVID-19 pandemic is still evolving, placing a huge burden on healthcare facilities. Certain coagulation indicators, inflammatory indicators, and comorbidities contribute to the prognosis of patients. Our study results may help clinicians optimize the treatment and ultimately reduce the mortality rate.","Zhou, Xianghui; Cheng, Zhipeng; Shu, Dan; Lin, Wenyi; Ming, Zhangyin; Chen, Wei; Hu, Yu",Aging (Albany NY),25,24

We conducted a systematic scoping review to identify network-building interventions that address loneliness and isolation, describe their components and impact on network structure, and consider their application in the wake of COVID19. METHODS: We performed forward and backward citation tracking of three seminal publications on network interventions and Bibliographic search of Web of Science and SCOPUS. We developed data charting tables and extracted and synthesized the characteristics of included studies, using an iteratively updating form. FINDINGS: From 3390 retrieved titles and abstracts, we included 8 studies. These interventions focused on building networks at either individual- or group-levels. Key elements that were incorporated in the interventions at varying degrees included (a) creating opportunities to build networks; (b) improving social skills; (c) assessing network diagnostics (i.e. using network data or information to inform network strategies); (d) promoting engagement with influential actors; and (e) a process for goal-setting and feedback. The effect of interventions on network structures, or the moderating effect of structure on the intervention effectiveness was rarely assessed. CONCLUSIONS: As many natural face-to-face opportunities for social connection are limited due to COVID19, groups already at risk for social isolation and loneliness are disproportionately impacted. Network-building interventions include multiple components that address both the structure of individuals’ networks, and their skills and motivation for activating them. These intervention elements could be adapted for delivery via online platforms, and implemented by trained facilitators or novice volunteers, although more rigorous testing is needed.","Yousefi Nooraie, Reza; Warren, Keith; Juckett, Lisa A.; Cao, Qiuchang A.; Bunger, Alicia C.; Patak-Pietrafesa, Michele A.",PLoS One,25,5
688508,688508,688508,Isolation of infectious bronchitis virus from a flock of racing pigeons,8.743033,6.09423,2008-03-10,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the seventh human coronavirus infectious disease, was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, followed by its rapid spread globally (251,059 deaths, on May 5, 2020, by Johns Hopkins University). An early clinical report showed that fever, cough, fatigue, sputum production, and myalgia were initial symptoms, with the development of pneumonia as the disease progressed. Increases in the level of serum liver enzymes, D-dimer, cardiac troponin I, and creatinine have been observed in severely ill patients, indicating that multiple organ failure had occurred in these cases. Lymphopenia and an increase in interleukin-6 (IL-6) were also observed. Although COVID-19 patients are administered glucocorticoid therapy to treat the excessive immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, the efficacy of this form of therapy is unclear. Viremia is observed in severe cases, suggesting that in addition to type II alveolar epithelial cells, many cell types, such as vascular endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, renal tubular cells, neuronal cells, and lymphocytes, may be damaged. The improvement of survival rates requires elucidation of the mechanism by which cellular damage occurs during viral infection. Cellular therapy, along with organ support systems such as oxygen therapy, artificial ventilation, extra corporeal membrane oxygenation and dialysis, as well as antiviral therapy, are required. Viral replication in infected host cells may perturb protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), causing ER stress. Although an adaptive cellular response, i.e. the unfolded protein response, can compensate for the misfolded protein burden to some extent, continued viral proliferation may induce inflammation and cell death. Therefore, we propose that proteostasis dysfunction may cause conformational disorders in COVID-19. The application of pharmacological chaperone therapy to treat COVID-19 patients is additionally discussed.","Aoe, Tomohiko",Front Pharmacol,25,1
